# How to install the project 
All the required packages are in the txt file `requirements.txt`.
## Data to download 
Some of the files are too big to be uploaded on GitHub. They are however available at [this link](https://drive.switch.ch/index.php/s/bVBCqB0ReuX8e6z). In order to make the code runs, please follow these instructions.

* The folder `user_comments` containing all the .json files must be put into the folder `./Raw/`.
* The file `english_comments` must be in the folder `.Data/Preprocessing`
