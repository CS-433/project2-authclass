You need to level up the SRS levels of kanji and radicals in order to increase your account level and unlock more kanji and radicals. WaniKani items are leveled up when you correctly study them.

You need to guru all of an account level's kanji before you can unlock the next account level.\n\nIf you answer all of your reviews perfectly, the absolute maximum speed for getting guru on an item is 3 days and 12 hours. \n\nSince you need to guru your radicals first before doing the kanji, the maximum speed that you can advance a level is 1 week.\n\nIf you started now, and studied every day doing reviews and lessons as soon as they were available to you, you'd reach level 30 by about September 20th of this year. \n\nI don't think that is actually realistic for most people though. Even if you have a good chunk of Japanese experience. The reviews become too overwhelming in number. And it doesn't account for human fallibility--getting sick, getting bored, having other priorities like friends or family. \n\nI've passed N2 and I do WaniKani because my kanji is very weak.

You can select albums using Documents and transfer them to your computer this way.~~\n\nActually, while I still recommend Documents by Readdle as a pain free way to get files off of your phone no matter what your ecosystem, I just tried it for photos and it is non-responsive. I want to say in defense of the app (and my recommendation) that I've transferred a lot of files, large and small, to and from my phone using that app and have had no problems.

You don't need to spend so much time tinkering with your phone or computer to make things \"just right\"--partly because you can't customize it all that much, to be honest, but partly because its already not awful out of the box. \n\nAs far as mixing ecosystems is concerned, that I'm less experienced with. I've heard that accessing things like your Photos on Windows is a pain. It's super easy on a Macbook, it's integrated into your system. I think on Windows you only have the iCloud web app though. \n\nIf you choose to use apps that are cross-platform, that'll help a lot. I'm using Bear for notes and Spark for email, which don't have Windows apps, so that would be inconvenient for me if I tried to mix ecosystems. But if I needed to, I could always swap those out for Onenote and Outlook, or something like that. \n\nIt definitely is nicer if everything is on the same ecosystem though. My Macbook will unlock by detecting my Apple Watch, for example. There's a feature called \"AirDrop\" which lets you seamlessly drop files between your devices via Bluetooth. \n\nAlso, as a developer, I love having a Linux-like shell available all the time. You can set that up with Windows (especially now with WSL), but it is a bit less seamless.", "created_utc": "1643857977.0", "edited": "1644025620.0", "id": "hvdcrwv", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_sj068g", "parent_id": "t3_sj068g", "score": "4", "subreddit": "ios", "subreddit_id": "t5_2ru5b"}, {"author": "mca62511", "body": "You should write a fantasy novel that takes place there.", "created_utc": "1643534804.0", "edited": "False", "id": "huu127f", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_sfv67b", "parent_id": "t3_sfv67b", "score": "1", "subreddit": "mildlyinteresting", "subreddit_id": "t5_2ti4h"}, {"author": "mca62511", "body": "What baby monitor is this?", "created_utc": "1643473669.0", "edited": "False", "id": "huqgrr5", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_sexgyw", "parent_id": "t3_sexgyw", "score": "1", "subreddit": "daddit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rxue"}, {"author": "mca62511", "body": "To anyone complaining about being spoiled: I\u2019m just impressed you\u2019ve gone this long without bumping into anything online.", "created_utc": "1643409904.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hun9ho4", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_sesr2y", "parent_id": "t3_sesr2y", "score": "95", "subreddit": "mealtimevideos", "subreddit_id": "t5_32abf"}, {"author": "mca62511", "body": "You just got to find someone with whom you can speak, preferably every day. \n\n> I have tried taking private lessons before, but I feel like teachers avoid teaching me because they would rather teach beginners than trying to help \"someone who already knows Japanese\". \n\nYou might try avoiding teachers then and just go for the \"I'm not going to teach you, I'm just going to have conversations with you\" kind of \"tutors\" on sites like iTalki (they're cheaper than real teachers anyway).\n\nThat, or, if you can, just find someone willing to talk to you every day or every other day for free or as part of a language exchange. \n\nI mean, I guess it depends on what you mean by \"I suck at speaking.\" If you are confident when you speak but you feel like you make a lot of mistakes and you want someone to point them out and guide you to sounding more natural, then yeah you probably need a teacher.\n\nBut if \"I suck at speaking\" means that you don't have any confidence when you speak and you can barely get your ideas out, then you probably need opportunity way more than you need instruction.", "created_utc": "1643331880.0", "edited": "False", "id": "huipsju", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_se3crw", "parent_id": "t3_se3crw", "score": "1", "subreddit": "LearnJapanese", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qyls"}, {"author": "mca62511", "body": "Maybe try drinking coffee in a thermos? \n\nLike, I think the whole thing is dumb, but sounds like there's a pretty pain-free non-confrontational way to get around this if you want to.", "created_utc": "1643245026.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hudijms", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_scyho0", "parent_id": "t3_scyho0", "score": "2", "subreddit": "japanlife", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rg2o"}, {"author": "mca62511", "body": "That's a shame.

Scraping the data and converting it into something I can easily and reliably iterate over.\n\nHow you go about coding this depends on the programming language you use. I've used JavaScript/Node for this, and so I use either normal http requests via Axios to do the scraping (and then extract the data myself by parsing the response with my own custom code) or in cases where I've needed something more complex I've used casperjs so I can do stuff like press buttons on a page before grabbing the data.\n\nBasically, I request the page's data, extract the data I need, and then I'll save it in like an array of data that's saved as JSON into a file. \n\nThere are a lot of points of failure for scraping, so you want to write a script that saves your progress as you go, and allows for you to restart where you left off if you lose connection or something like that.\n\nBut basically the goal here is to save the raw data from the web pages locally so you can then later iterate over it and transform the data into something you actually want to use in Anki later. You could theoretically write all this into the same script, but then you have to rely on your script never failing, and there's no way to screen the scraped data before importing it into Anki.\n\n### 2. Edit the data to account for any errors in the scraping or to change it in a desired way before inserting into Anki.\n\nSo hopefully now you'll have the data saved locally so you can work with it and get it into the shape you need for importing it into Anki.\n\nPerhaps you want to join your scraped data together with some other data. Or perhaps you've learned that when you scraped your data you accidentally pulled some unwanted HTML tags. \n\nHere I'd write a script to iterate over the data and change it one last time before actually importing it into Anki.\n\n### 3. Importing the data into Anki.\n\nThe easiest way to do this is to write a script that takes you JSON file and converts it to a TSV or CSV. From there you can just use Anki's import feature on the desktop app.\n\nHowever, if you want to import pictures or audio, you'll need something more fancy.\n\nFor that I use the [AnkiConnect](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/2055492159) plugin. It creates a local web server that exposes and API which lets you interact with Anki. Using that you can create decks, notes and cards using the information you scraped earlier and even include pictures and audio.\n\n... There's quite a lot involved actually. I don't mind answering further questions, but again, as it is highly dependent on what you want to scrape, what languages and tools you want to use, and how complex the resulting deck is, what you need to do might be different from what I've done.", "created_utc": "1637123990.0", "edited": "1637243977.0", "id": "hky7we9", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_qvagy4", "parent_id": "t3_qvagy4", "score": "3", "subreddit": "Anki", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s9lm"}, {"author": "mca62511", "body": "By the way, \u3093\u3060 on its own actually does mean \"Yeah\" in Akita dialect.", "created_utc": "1637119802.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hkxzj3w", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_qvc3ex", "parent_id": "t3_qvc3ex", "score": "4", "subreddit": "LearnJapanese", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qyls"}, {"author": "mca62511", "body": "I wholeheartedly agree with you OP.

Conservative Christians don't even think it works that way. Whether you're \"going to hell\" or not isn't contingent on your perfectly filling one condition or another, because a basic tenant of Christian faith is that any and all conditions are already fulfilled by Jesus.\n\nBut I imagine the root of your question is more, \"How can I carry out the command to 'love your neighbour' when empathy is inherently difficult or even impossible for me?\"\n\n> Because of autism I\u2019m unable to love\n\nIn English the word \"love\" has a really wide range of meaning. We use it to talk about our parents, our sexual partners, and our favorite foods.\n\nThe New Testament was written in Greek, and the words used to talk about \"love\" are a little more specific. In Matthew 5 when Jesus is saying, \"Love your neighbor,\" he is using the word \"agape.\" This kind of love actually doesn't have that much to do with emotion. It is a decision more than it is an emotion. It isn't based on empathy for another or even liking others.\n\nAgape is a willful choice to try to treat others with love in the way described in 1 Corinthians 13. And yeah, there are some parts of that definition which are going to be inherently difficult for someone who is neurodivergent. But there are probably even aspects of that definition that you will excel at that someone who is neurotypical might find difficult. Some Christians let their feelings about others get in the way of them loving others. In a way, you have an advantage in not having to deal with that as much.\n\nThe long and short of what I'm trying to say is there's a lot more to love than emotions, and the bulk of what Christians are called to do concerning love has less to do with how you feel, and more to do with what you choose to do.", "created_utc": "1635128267.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hhxtejp", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_qf5m6m", "parent_id": "t1_hhxmo50", "score": "7", "subreddit": "Christianity", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh6c"}, {"author": "mca62511", "body": "> Because of autism I\u2019m unable to love\n\nCan you unpack what you mean by that?", "created_utc": "1635124794.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hhxmlbr", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_qf5m6m", "parent_id": "t3_qf5m6m", "score": "8", "subreddit": "Christianity", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh6c"}, {"author": "mca62511", "body": "So long as you avoid collecting pogs you should be fine.", "created_utc": "1635123731.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hhxkhcv", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_qf0esy", "parent_id": "t1_hhwx9oh", "score": "0", "subreddit": "Christianity", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh6c"}, {"author": "mca62511", "body": "Pok\u00e9mon, but what made it particularly stupid was that one of the reasons adults cited was, \u201cChildren repeating the Pok\u00e9mon\u2019s names over and over again is evidence of demonic possession.\u201d", "created_utc": "1635029400.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hhsloah", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_qe7468", "parent_id": "t3_qe7468", "score": "1", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i"}, {"author": "mca62511", "body": "In the age of flex box this is no longer something anyone should consider difficult.\n\nMaybe if it said, \u201cYou must vertically center a div and it must display correctly on IE6.\u201d", "created_utc": "1634971406.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hhptciz", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_qdsr3p", "parent_id": "t3_qdsr3p", "score": "5", "subreddit": "ProgrammerHumor", "subreddit_id": "t5_2tex6"}, {"author": "mca62511", "body": "It\u2019s arguable which is more difficult.

Wanikani level 16 means you would know 100% of the N5 kanji and 97% of the N4 kanji (and not just recognize the kanji, but know vocabulary associated with all of them).\n\nGet [Pimsleur Japanese](https://www.pimsleur.com/learn-japanese) and do a lesson every day. Pimsleur is not free and it can be expensive. You can often find it at your local library. If you have Audible coins, you can get it through Audible. And they have a nice app now that costs $20.95/month. Other than for the money aspect, it is an easy, pain free way to expose yourself to spoken Japanese and get yourself speaking Japanese.\n\nBuy Genki I and II. That should be enough grammar for you to tackle N4 and N5.  find the Minna no Nihongo collection of books difficult to figure out if you don't know what you're doing.\n\nIf possible, grab the [Attain Corp. JLPT N5](https://www.udemy.com/course/japanese-n5-course/) and [N4](https://www.udemy.com/course/japanese-n4-course/) course from Udemy *if they are on sale* (hell, buy them full price if you can afford it, but I certainly wouldn't). If you can get these, then you can skip buying Genki. They are really good guides to the grammar and vocabulary for N4 and N5. If you do buy them, don't focus too much on the vocabulary. If you stick to WaniKani, you should have enough vocabulary by the end of four months. \n\nLook up an app called [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) and learn how it works. It is basically a digital flashcard program. Make flashcards of the grammar from Genki and/or Attain Corp JLPT lessons and drill them every day. \n\nFind a premade deck Anki deck with sentences such as [this one](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/2141233552). When you use the deck, don't grade yourself on being able to perfectly read the Japanese, but rather grade yourself on whether or not you understood it when the audio plays. Remember, you're going to get your reading down by doing Wanikani. If you don't know what I mean by \"grade yourself,\" it will be clear after you look up what Anki is. \n\nAfter two months of study, (or earlier if you can afford it) go on [iTalki](https://www.italki.com/) and find yourself a language partner and/or tutor.\n\nYeah, everything I suggested (other than for Anki) costs money. Yeah, you can learn Japanese for free and on your own. It's hard though, especially with those time constraints.

I say \"meant to be\" because obviously you technically could pass anything into them, it would just throw an error.\n\nIt generates a number between 1 and 2, and then based on an if condition it will either execute `functionA` or `functionB`.\n\nHere is an example of how you could use it.\n\n    const logHello = () => {\n        console.log(\"Hello\");\n    }\n    \n    const logGoodbye = () => {\n        console.log(\"Goodbye\");\n    }\n    \n    executeAFunctionRandomly(logHello, logGoodbye);\n\nIn the above we're making two functions, one that logs the word \"Hello\" and one that logs the word \"Goodbye\". We're then passing them into the function `executeAFunctionRandomly`. The result will be that it will log either \"Hello\" or \"Goodbye,\" but not both.\n\nIf you understand that so far, the only missing element is the concept of anonymous functions. An anonymous function is an unnamed function. You can write an anonymous function directly into the arguments of another function. So using an anonymous function you could write the above code like so,\n\n    executeAFunctionRandomly(() => {\n        console.log(\"Hello\");\n    },\n    () => {\n        console.log(\"Goodbye\");\n    });\n\nThat's it really. A callback function is just a function that is being passed into another function, so that it can then be executed later by the function that it was passed into. This becomes really useful for handling things that execute asynchronously such as HTTPS requests.\n\njQuery's `post` and `get` methods are good examples of this (though maybe a little outdated).\n\n    $.get(\"https://v2.jokeapi.dev/joke/Programming?type=single\", (data) => {\n        console.log(data.joke);\n    })\n\nThe jQuery `get` method is a function that takes a URL as its first argument, and then a callback function as its second argument. It makes an HTTPS request to the specified URL, and then it waits for a response. After it gets a response, it turns the response into a JSON object, and then calls the callback function using the JSON object as the first argument of the function.\n\nTherefore when we run `console.log(data.joke)`, assuming there were no errors on the API side, you'll get a joke about programming.\n\nThese days it is more common to use promises with async and await for this type of thing, but in order to be effective in JavaScript it is important to understand how you can pass functions into other functions. This is what is meant when people say that in JavaScript, functions are \"first class objects.\" They can be passed around and manipulated just like any other object.\n\nDoes that help clear things up?

Map is a function. If you were to write it from scratch, the function looks a little bit like this.\n\n    Array.prototype.map = function(callback) {\n      // This is simplified, btw. \n\n      const result = [];\n      const length = this.length;\n    \n      for (let i = 0; i < length; i++) {\n        let value = callback(this[i], i, this);\n        result.push(value);\n      }\n    \n      return result;\n    };\n\nThat might be kind of confusing, but I'll try to summarize the important points. The thing you put between `()` in `users.map()` is a function. You are passing a function into a function. The `map` function then loops over all of the items in the array, and it passes that item into the function that you provide it.\n\nSo you could use the previous example function like this,\n\n    users.map(getName);\n\nWhat that will do, is it will take each object inside the `users` array, and then pass it into `getName` as the first argument.\n\nIn actuality, this,\n\n    users.map(getName);\n\nis effectively doing this,\n\n    const callback = callback;\n    callback(users[0], 0, users);\n    callback(users[1], 1, users);\n    callback(users[2], 2, users);\n\nRemember what the `getName` function looked like? It looked like this,\n\n    function getName(user) {\n       return user.name;\n    }\n\nWe named our first argument `user`, but it doesn't have to be, it could even be `gurple` and it would still work the same way. Also, since we're only using the function one time, we don't really need to define it. Instead we can use an *anonymous function* as shown below.\n\n    users.map(function(user) {\n       return user.name;\n    });\n\nWe didn't name the function, we just created a nameless anonymous function and passed it directly into `map`.\n\nAs you can see, the argument name `user` is just part of our function definition. We can call it whatever we want.\n\n    users.map(function(fizzBuzzFooBar) {\n       return fizzBuzzFooBar.name;\n    });\n\nChanging the argument name to `fizzBuzzFooBar` changes absolutely nothing.\n\nThe final piece of information necessary to understand what is going on, is simply to know that there are various ways of defining functions in JavaScript. I'll change the argument name back to `user`, but I'll write the function as an arrow function.\n\n    const getName = (user) => {\n       return user.name;\n    }\n\nHave you seen that before? That's called an arrow function. There are a couple of ways that you can shorten arrow functions. For example, if you immediately returning something, you don't need the brackets {}.\n\n    const getName = (user) => user.name;\n\nI've changed the syntax, but I still haven't changed the result. I'm still making a function called getName which returns the `name` key of the object passed to it.\n\nAnother way you can shorten arrow functions, is that if you are only using one argument, you don't need the parenthesis () around the argument.\n\n    const getName = user => user.name;\n\nAgain, in the above the syntax has changed, but the result has not. You can still do `users.map(getName)` with the above function and it will have the same result.\n\nHowever, remember, we aren't reusing the function, so there's no point in giving the function a name. You can also write arrow functions as anonymous functions, which means that you can condense the following code,\n\n    const getName = user => user.name;\n    \n    users.map(getName);\n\nto the following,\n\n    users.map(user => user.name);\n\nYou're passing the anonymous function `user => user.name` as the first argument of the `map` function.\n\nThe `user` part is just the name of the argument that you assigned it. It could be anything and still work.\n\n    users.map(z => z.name);\n\nThe above will accomplish exactly the same thing as the previous code.", "created_utc": "1626153033.0", "edited": "False", "id": "h507ri2", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_oj06e3", "parent_id": "t3_oj06e3", "score": "4", "subreddit": "learnjavascript", "subreddit_id": "t5_2tugi"}, {"author": "mca62511", "body": "Tagging OP ( u/kanzensuu28 ) so they see this.\n\nCan I make a counter point?\n\nIt's true that the English keywords and stories would be unnecessary, but RTK does a really good job of ordering the kanji so that they build off of each other. First you get \u53e3, then \u65e5, then \u76ee, then \u7acb, then \u8c9d (which has \u76ee in it), then \u54e1 (which has \u8c9d and \u53e3 in it), then \u97f3 (which has \u7acb and \u65e5 in it), and then \u97fb (which has \u97f3 and \u54e1 in it).\n\nThe component parts build off of each other in a gradual logical way which makes it easier to gradually learn to write the characters.

Additionally, you can use the English keywords you learned to build mnemonics for the vocabulary (something like, \"It takes a strong exertion to study.\").\n\nedit: Also my advice is to not make it more complicated than it needs to be. In the past when I've tried this method, I've always failed because I'm like, \"Well, if I'm studying this, I might as well throw in some vocab words as well.\" or something like that.\n\nThe \"20 new cards a day\" thing only works when the cards are super simple.

Their inventory is really unreliable though (or at least my local one is). The products available online *do not* represent what is available in the shop. I asked one of the salespeople there and they said that they don't even have like a set inventory that they get. They get different things with each shipment, and so if they're sold out of something they probably won't get new stock in.\n\nOther than that, I'd say just make a habit out of asking whenever you see a shoe store. They'll almost always, 99% of the time immediately tell you they only carry up to 28, 29 or 30, but once in a blue moon you'll find a store that does carry size 31 and now you have another option to check when you're in the market for shoes. \n\nYou can find a lot online. The key is to avoid aimlessly clicking around and instead make use of the various website's filter options. \n\n[Amazon](https://www.amazon.co.jp/s?k=%E3%82%B7%E3%83%A5%E3%83%BC%E3%82%BA&rh=n%3A2221070051%2Cp_n_size_browse-vebin%3A2230661051&dc&__mk_ja_JP=%E3%82%AB%E3%82%BF%E3%82%AB%E3%83%8A&qid=1620275201&rnid=2230617051&ref=sr_nr_p_n_size_browse-vebin_23) has a filter for size. One nice thing about Amazon is that they have a service called \"Amazon wardrobe\" which lets you order clothes (and shoes), try them on, and then return them by mail if you don't like the fit. It's easier to use than you'd think. \n\n[Rakuten](https://search.rakuten.co.jp/search/mall/%E3%82%B7%E3%83%A5%E3%83%BC%E3%82%BA/-/tg1001567/) also has a filter for size. They don't have a \"wardrobe\" like function (that I'm aware of at least) but they seem to have better variety than Amazon (at least for the shoes I was looking for).\n\nI've had some luck with [Big-B](https://www.big-b.jp/shoeslist/shoeslist.html?kind=newshoes&pageindex=1). Again, filter by size. They seem to have some stuff that I don't see on Rakuten or Amazon and in general keep a lot of size 31 in stock (compared to other sites).\n\n[GALLERY 2](https://www.gallery2.co.jp/) has a sports focus, but is otherwise similar to Big-B. Different inventory from the other sites, but does keep a good number of size 31 shoes in stock.\n\nIf there's a brand you like, and if they do make size 31 in Japan, you can usually have good luck ordering directly from their site. [Nike](https://www.nike.com/jp/w/mens-shoes-2cq6yz88difz9hh0lznik1zy7ok)'s site is really good like that, has a size filter, and makes some of their shoes in Japan in size 31. However, I often find that size 31 is sold out on Nike's website (at least for the shoes I'm actually interested in) even if they theoretically make them (thus my earlier complaint). \n\n[Yahoo Shopping](https://shopping.yahoo.co.jp/search?kspec=E353402&p=%E3%82%B7%E3%83%A5%E3%83%BC%E3%82%BA&tab_ex=commerce&area=13&sc_i=shp_pc_search_spec_spec) also has a size filter and carries some size 31 products.", "created_utc": "1620275983.0", "edited": "False", "id": "gx46jx5", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_n5qgee", "parent_id": "t1_gx42zpv", "score": "3", "subreddit": "japanlife", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rg2o"}, {"author": "mca62511", "body": "It's not popular, so they keep a limited inventory.

I use it in a similar way as described above for Reverso Context: Look up a word or phrase, and then look at the various ways in which it is used and try to decide if it is appropriate for the context.", "created_utc": "1619149298.0", "edited": "False", "id": "gvj0x6c", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_mwlkb7", "parent_id": "t1_gvixhu1", "score": "3", "subreddit": "LearnJapanese", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qyls"}, {"author": "mca62511", "body": "\"I hope you enjoy\" is a bit weird in English too, no?\n\nYou'd more naturally say something like, \"Oh, cool, have fun.\"\n\n\"Have fun,\" as others have pointed out, is like \u697d\u3057\u3093\u3067\u306d", "created_utc": "1619148889.0", "edited": "1619149514.0", "id": "gvj07kg", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_mwlkb7", "parent_id": "t3_mwlkb7", "score": "2", "subreddit": "LearnJapanese", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qyls"}, {"author": "mca62511", "body": "My experience is that DeepL is usually better than Google Translate.

It wasn't bad, it's just that if I would've gotten out after my first two or three years I would've had that much more time to spend on an actual career.\n\nIf your career goals are teaching oriented it is a bit different I guess. But if you want to live in Japan long term, the career prospects for English teachers aren't great.

And while there may be some things where you can say, \"Generally people do...\" it is dangerous to say, because you really don't want to give someone false expectations.\n\nTake me and my friend Jake (name changed for the sake of privacy). We met at Tokyo orientation. We had both been placed in Akita city, both placed in high schools. Turns out we both got put in different apartments in the same mansion building. We even had similar education histories and were both people who joined JET later in life rather than after college. We both had non-ESL teaching experience.\n\nHow different could things be?\n\nWell, for one, despite it being the same building, my apartment was completely empty. Nothing: no bed, no stove, no fridge, no chairs, no AC. Just walls and floors.\n\nJake's apartment was furnished: futons, small table, fridge, stove, AC and washing machine.\n\nMy main school contacted a local car dealer and set up meeting so I could get a good deal on a car rental before I even arrived. I had a car and was driving in a week.\n\nJake's main school did not want him to drive at all. They were worried it was too unsafe. When he, out of his own volition, found a car to rent, the school asked him to not drive it to school for a month as a safety precaution (as though waiting a month somehow will make a difference?)\n\nMy main school forbade me from using my laptop at work. What does an ALT need a laptop for anyway? Teachers don't need to use computers. If you need to look something up or print something out, there's a community office computer in the teacher's room (running windows 98 with only Internet Explorer installed).\n\nJake's main school encouraged him to take his laptop with him to work. \n\nMy school (at least in my first year) mostly just wanted me making up games for students. When I asked to see the curriculum or asked them what grammar point they were teaching, I was told not to worry about that sort of thing.\n\nJake's school wanted him making full lesson plans based on the curriculum. Jake in his first year was fully in charge of the classroom, with the JTE basically there as a supervisor. \n\nSo, yeah, every situation really is different. In fact the situation is different from year to year. Eventually Jake could drive. Eventually I had a larger role in the classroom. Eventually the school bought me a laptop. Things are really just *so* different depending on your particular school (and who the teachers and staff are at that particular school).

I have a friend who used TypeScript, and he'd always say, \"I like TypeScript because you can do X,\" and 99% of the time X was a feature I was using already in JavaScript, because either A) It was just a modern JavaScript feature and not unique to TypeScript, or B) It was a feature I had enabled by installing a Babel plugin or a library.\n\nHere's the thing though: JavaScript *can* have a rich set of modern features with Babel/Webpack. But that's the thing. It *can*. It can also *not* have those features. It could also have an infinite variety of configurations that any individual user could set up for their project.\n\nTypeScript helps get people on the same page. If someone says, \"This is a JavaScript project\" I have no idea what to expect. If someone says, \"This is a TypeScript project,\" I have a marginally better idea what my development experience is going to be like. It's true that there are various configurations for TypeScript, but the variations are less severe when compared to JavaScript.\n\nHere's a good example of what I mean: If I want type checking in my JavaScript, I can use Flow. However if we hire a new JavaScript developer, I can't be confident that they already know how to use Flow. If we hire a TypeScript developer, I can be sure they at least have a basic idea about how to program in a statically typed programming language. \n\n> The compiled JS does not look as clean as when I wrote it me\n\nIf you're not using TypeScript, you should be using something to minimize your JS in production anyway. \n\nJavaScript is to TypeScript what assembler is to C. Only the computer is meant to read it.\n\n> The bugs you catch are minor\n\nI agree. Especially if you're comparing it to a modern Babel/ESNEXT type of setup.\n\n> It is a lot more work to type everything\n\nIt is.

Or are you just waiting for the problem to fix itself? Do you proactively talk to your JTE about involving you in class? When your JTE comes to you to join class, do you already have activities prepared? Reflect on what you do every day and try to see if there's any way you can be more proactive about what you do at work.\n\n**Talk to your coworkers about your problem.** There are three reasons I suggest this.\n\nFirst, they know you, the other teacher, and the situation better than anyone else could. They might have some insight into the current situation in your office that might help you. It is possible there might be something you're doing that is causing the problem that you are unaware of, and your coworkers might be able to point that out to you.\n\nSecond, indirectly addressing a problem through a third party is a very Japanese way of solving things. Your coworkers might talk to the problem JTE on your behalf and help make things better. This might sound back-handed or gossipy, but it's really just the way things are done (remember that if it is ever done to you).\n\nThird, you might find out that you're not the only person that has a problem with that individual. This doesn't really help fix the situation, but it certainly helps you feel better.\n\n**Don't rest your hopes on changing the situation within this fiscal year.** The thing is, the status quo at school changes every year. Every year they shuffle the staff around. For you, a year feels like a long time. Hell, you might only be here for a year. However, for your coworkers a year is nothing. Why rock the boat to fix a problem if in a few months the deck is going to be re-shuffled and the problem might fix itself? Even when active steps are made to change something, change is usually very slow in Japan. Even if you have a truly horrible JTE, and even if the consensus is that something does need to change, those changes probably won't be enacted until next year. \n\n**Focus on things you can control.** Is there anything at school that you have control over? For me it was English club. English club is usually good for this because the ALT usually has full control over it. Make that English club the best that it can be. Really pour your all into it. If you don't have one, try to start one. \n\n**Realize that your not being used in class is not necessarily indicative of your performance as an ALT.** I wish I would've realized this sooner. The amount you are used in class has more to do with what that particular JTE expects out of an ALT, any ALT, than it has to do with you specifically.\n\nMost teachers re-use their plans every year (when they can), and the ALT is this big frustrating variable that is difficult to plan for. Therefore, for the most part, when JTEs plan out their year, they aren't specifically thinking, \"HondaS2000AP1 is a good teacher, so I'll give them a lot of responsibility\" or even \"HondaS2000AP1 is a bad teacher, so I'm never going to use them.\" They're most likely thinking, \"I really don't want to be in a bad spot if the ALT doesn't come up with anything, so I'll just make my lesson plan without considering what the ALT will do and fit them in whenever I have time.\" Making specific lesson plans considering the specific skills of a specific ALT is a lot of extra work--especially since the ALT may leave or you might change schools any given year. Some JTEs will do that extra work, but many, especially older JTEs who have been doing this for decades, won't.\n\nIn addition to the above there are office politics, personal vendettas between teachers, and a whole world of other considerations that weigh much more heavily on how often you're used at work than your class to class performance. \n\n**Don't use work/school as your primary sense of fulfillment.** Have hobbies. Go be a DJ, join a D&D group, create a charity organization: Do something, preferably social, that you can derive some fulfillment out of. This isn't to say that you shouldn't get fulfillment out of work, but rather due to the fact that you have so little control over your work environment, it is better to get your primary fulfillment elsewhere.", "created_utc": "1607948653.0", "edited": "1607949052.0", "id": "gft09ea", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_kcck6v", "parent_id": "t1_gfsra5t", "score": "11", "subreddit": "JETProgramme", "subreddit_id": "t5_2w9xe"}, {"author": "mca62511", "body": "The only way in way in which JET helped me get to where I am now is that it got me to Japan, and let me spend five years building connections with people in the city I ended up in.
