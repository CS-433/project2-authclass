That means: abortion until there is a big percentage of it being able to not only survive but also be healthy and from that point on the option should be a c-section while signing away all your rights and obligations as a parent so I don't have to think about it ever again and don't have to pay for the parasyte that came out of me.\n\nWhen a foetus is life at the point of an abortion then that means someone died which of course is a tragedy and shouldn't have happened but it did and eventually it was just a question of the lesser evil.

Sex shouldn't hurt women, not even the first time. Many people talk about how painful the first time is for women but that's actually just a religious sexist misinformation which becomes true when women hear that from everyone and believe in it, so they're not relaxed and generally anxious which makes them tighten and not being wet enough. Then they'll go on and tell their female friends how much the first time hurt them and thus continues the vicious circle. Actually the hyphen isn't even meant to break (although different types of hymens exist and some may get a little crack and blood but still shouldn't be really painful), it rather widens.

But not honey bees but wild bees because honey bees only like a few plants, so by artificially increasing the honey bee population through bee keeping the wild bee population decreases - those bees that would really be needed the most in our ecosystem.\n\nBut tbh I don't even know why people are arguing with me over bee keeping here, it's not like I said that beekeepers were monsters and we had to boycott them.

They still often rip off the queen's wings and use smoke like the woman in the video, both practices that I wouldn't call very nice to the bees.

Cutting out only some things and Meatless Mondays isn't the solution and shouldn't be the final goal but they're a step in the right direction and better than changing nothing. You don't need to immediately give up everything, but starting to try alternatives, make coffee with plant milk instead of cows milk or ditch sausages even if you don't manage to give up cheese yet already goes a long way. I feel like many are overwhelmed by the thought of changing something because they feel like it's everything or nothing but every step is a good one. I've seen people tell me that they like soy yoghurt as much as cow yoghurt for example but could never go vegan because they love cheese so much, and thus continue to buy cow yoghurt instead of just switching this one thing. I don't know if it's clear what I'm trying to convey, it's just that you don't have to do it 100% perfect from the very beginning and if you fucked up a couple of times it doesn't mean you can't do it and that what you're already doing isn't also worth something.", "created_utc": "1609501868.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ghpa19c", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_ipt7j9", "parent_id": "t1_gavykci", "score": "1", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i"}, {"author": "NaneKyuuka", "body": "I'm sorry but yeah, that's pretty homophobic.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso sorry for the off-topic, but why did I read *Pete Buttigieg* as Peter Pettigrew?", "created_utc": "1609501106.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ghp8r8q", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_ko5z4g", "parent_id": "t3_ko5z4g", "score": "2", "subreddit": "bisexual", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qwnx"}, {"author": "NaneKyuuka", "body": "Because bi men don't even exist.

Why? Because otherwise there would be overpopulation which would be damaging to environment\n\nBut why do these cows exist in the first place? Because we're breeding them for food. If we stopped eating them we'd also stop breeding them and they wouldn't even be born, so I don't see a problem with overpopulation here. Humans are the ones overpopulating (and nobody would even think of suggesting that we needed to kill billions of humans because of it).\n\n\n> we already have enough environmental problems. \n\nTrue. And a whole bunch of them, especially the most serious ones, are partially caused by animal farming and wouldn't be a big problem if people were vegan.\n\n\n> But isn't the whole eating thing immoral then?\n\nI don't think so. I don't consider it immoral to do something if you've got no other choice in order to survive. But is there really a need for us to kill sentinient beings and damage the environment, harm other people and our own health along the way?\n\n\n> How do we know for sure plants don't want to live too. Again, we don't know what conscience is. What if plants had it? Why should we only spare creatures similar to us?\n\nWell, we dom't know. But we know for sure that animals a conscient and want to live. If you had no choice but to harm somebody and you for sure that know person A feels pain and person B might feel pain, would you choose to harm person A because person B might feel pain? I'd guess you'd still better protect the one who you know for sure will suffer. Also, if we want to survive we need to eat something and we can't just eat stones. If you advocate for plant's feelings you'd actually be better off going vegan as vegans harm less plants than omnivores do. It's just more efficient to directly eat the plant than to feed it to an animal over years, which also eats a lot more than humans do, and then eat the animal.\n\n\n> At the moment we know nothing so we can only trust our personal moral compass.\n\nThat's the best we can do. Although I feel like most omnivores have a pretty similar moral compass to vegans, they're just acting contrary to it. I mean the whole point of veganism is to try not to have any animals suffer and die needlessly. If I asked you if you *want* animals to suffer and die you'd probably say of course not.

When she's sober she can be pretty normal if you're lucky and she doesn't blow up for once. Also I do believe that she loves us. Is that normal for BPD?\n\nIt really confuses me, it's like she has three personalities: *The Drunk* who's bitter and easily offended, *The Mom* who's rather normal and actually there for you and *The Lunatic* who makes everything about herself, talks for hours about herself and stuff that I'm not interested in while not letting me talk about my preferred topics or my day and who could blow up without reason, scream, destroy your things, get violent and give you the silent treatment. For a long time I thought that The Lunatic was part of The Drunk, but the story with my sister definitely included The Lunatic even though it was before her abuse. These personalities confuse me because if I say she has a disorder I feel like maybe she's just a bit intoxicated and I'm wrong, and how can she have this disorder when she's sometimes The Mom and doing well?

It's not only my safe haven but also much more worth living there than outside.\n\nI'm fully capable of living in the here and now and enjoying the moment, though. That usually happens when I travel or go on concerts. When I'm living 24/7 in my head it just means that my current world isn't worth more attention. I don't see a problem with this as I'm happy in my own world in my head and just enjoy life my way, so I don't feel like I'm missing out on something.\n\nI love traveling and plan to do it much more in the future (well, after Corona) because it makes me happy. When I'm somewhere like on a wonderful beach or in a bus exploring an exotic city I tend to live much more in the real world and spend less time inside my head. I see it almost like an advantage of being me, living in my head when my life's too boring and living in the moment when I'm doing what I love enables me to kind of live my dream all the time - either inside my head or in real. I also feel like it makes me psychologically much stronger and helps me go through hardships more easily than a lot of other people who just have to deal with problems alone in the real world without having this kind of safe haven.\n\nAlso, because most people just do their jobs without really liking them, actually wanting to do something else but not daring to lose their boring but safe job and wasting their short life like this, I feel like I'm living much more in the moment and enjoying life more than they do. Because I do what I love, like traveling most of the time, without letting the fear of not knowing what the next day will bring and how things will work out in the end stop me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Thinking, being in my head feels like the real thing.\n\nHonestly, it's the same for me most of the time (at least when not traveling). But like I said, what's wrong with it when you enjoy it? You're still using your time in this world doing the stuff you enjoy and it's real for *you*, isn't it? Why should that be worth less than how other people are living their life? See it as your personal strength, not as a weakness. And try do always do what you love in your life without letting your fears hold you back. I'm guessing there's still something lacking in your current life like in mine if you feel like nothing's real and worth something. If you find out what it is you might be able to change that.

I'm 22yo and bisexual (and -romantic) but have never fallen in love with someone in real life, so I thought either I'm just very picky or too introverted to meet enough new people or actually demiromantic. I've had about 3 small crushes but only reaaally minor ones that can hardly be referred to as real crushes. However I've fallen really hard for a celebrity for several years and I don't know if that means I'm not demi. First I thought I can't be because of that but then again maybe I still can because when you're obsessed with celebrities and you watch a lot of interviews and stuff you often end up feeling like you know them very well (even though it's actually not the case). That's how it was for me, it took me about two years being obsessed with this celebrity (like an extreme fan) and watching everything I found about them to the point I felt like I knew them in and out and knew exactly what they would say in which situation when I first noticed that I was developing a crush, but then I fell *hard*. I know that I don't really knew them but it felt like it. Regarding love at first sight, I always thought that was a myth (but apparently some people can really do that). So not sure if I'm a demiromantic that's delusional enough to still fall for a celebrity or if it's just that my pickiness doesn't go well with my introversion and preference to stay at home with a book over going out and meeting new people. Not that it matters that much, while the label bisexuality is good for explaining to others who you like I don't feel like I really need a label like demiromantic, but I'm still a little confused as to why I can't seem to fall in love with people I know (even close friends up to now) while my best friend for example is in her fifth or so relationship and commonly falls in love with several people at the same time, and it would still be nice to know why it is like that.\n\nSorry, that turned out a bit long.
