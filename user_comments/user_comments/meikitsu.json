What is acceptable to one person, is unacceptable to the next - and first and foremost, that is okay.\n\nAs it is impossible to define the line objectively, it has to be done subjectively, which means that if you feel uncomfortable with it, it\u2019s harassment.\n\nIn this case, my take is that you don\u2019t even need to worry if others see it as harassment: the guy went so far over the line that he will fall over the edge of the world soon.\n\nI know that this is very easy to say as a cis male, but be confident in yourself in how you interpret these - or any - comments. I hope there is someone around for you who can help you navigate this situation (in my company, I\u2019d go to HR, but I don\u2019t know the dynamics in your company; speaking with a colleague you trust can also help a lot), and where you can maybe even report your colleague\u2019s behaviour.\n\nFor what it\u2019s worth, I\u2019m a team manager IRL, and a while ago somebody came to me with a harassment complaint, but she didn\u2019t want to make a fuss about it. I discussed this with another team manager in my team (without mentioning her name, of course), and it turned out that my colleague had also received complaints about the same person. Together with the - for lack of a more respectful word - victims, we decided to make a case out of it, and we started a disciplinary action with the guy who made the comments; ultimately, he was dismissed because he did not change his behaviour. I\u2019m mentioning this mostly to illustrate that you might not be the only one who has been harassed; if - *and only if* - you feel comfortable speaking to someone about it, it may be possible to take action against that person and \u201cmotivate\u201d him to change his behaviour.\n\nI\u2019m also well aware that I may well be suggesting something that is uncomfortable to you; remember that the only responsibility for the guy\u2019s behaviour is his. Don\u2019t let a random guy on the internet talk you into something that doesn\u2019t work for you.\n\n(As a general request to Reddit: if you don\u2019t agree with my points, please let me know why not and share your suggestions. I\u2019m just a guy who cares, but who - thankfully - never suffered harassment.

One example that comes to mind is the EU-wide ban on battery cages that became effective in 2012; a couple of years later, there were reports about some member states not complying, and on a large scale. (I am uncertain of the current state of affairs.)\n\nIf country A does not comply with the ban on battery cages but country B does, a manufacturer in country B can still go and buy powdered, non-compliant eggs in country A, and on the mayonnaise they produce, it would say \u201cMade in country B\u201d. Which, to me, means that I still do not have any information, so we might as well stick with \u201cMade in the EU\u201d. \n\nAlternatively, to keep track of the origins of every ingredient in every product (I think we have the technology) would be such an overload of information that it becomes impossible to filter out what is relevant.\n\nSo yes, I would support this legislation, but with the side note that I think that the energy can be better spent on other things first.", "created_utc": "1629478022.0", "edited": "False", "id": "h9ojyte", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_p84335", "parent_id": "t3_p84335", "score": "0", "subreddit": "AskEurope", "subreddit_id": "t5_2uayg"}, {"author": "meikitsu", "body": "They absolutely should.", "created_utc": "1629388954.0", "edited": "False", "id": "h9jpimd", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_p6xp3n", "parent_id": "t1_h9jmhxa", "score": "1", "subreddit": "belgium", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhe6"}, {"author": "meikitsu", "body": "When I was little (nearing 40 now), we were almost drilled to not say \u201cmeid\u201d because it was supposedly an ugly term; until a couple of decades ago, \u201cmeid\u201d was the pejorative yet common term for a housekeeper. \n\nThen again, I think that the usage in that context died out in the 1960s or 1970s or so.\n\nFrom university onwards, I have always used \u201cmeid\u201d instead of \u201cmeisje\u201d, and honestly, nobody has complained.

When we received the news and needed to decide, for me, it was a very hard decision \u201cuntil\u201d. The choice itself is impossible to make, because you do not have enough information to make the right choice. Like any unborn child, you do not know what yours will end up like. You don\u2019t know if it will be in pain or not, you don\u2019t know anything about the amount of special care it will need, nothing. If you break it off and the child would have been happy and healthy, there is no going back (you would never know, but that does not mean the thought is not there). If the child is born but suffers enormously, that\u2019s on you as well. (Well, not necessarily, but I certainly would have felt it that way.) For me, it was very hard until I started to speak the options. We were 13 weeks into the pregnancy, and basically when I tried to speak aloud - to myself - that abortion was an option, I broke down and cried. The love I already felt for our little pea was so big that I had my answer. My wife never even doubted. Our little one is half a year old now, and we are lucky enough that we can be happy with our choice every single day. \n\nThis was our choice, and it made sense for us. For thousands or millions of people, it does not, and they choose abortion. And that is just as good. Nobody can decide but the parents (and ultimately, the mother). I am 100% convinced that it is better for a child not to be born than to be born to parents who do not want the child. So yes, I would say it\u2019s more than okay to chose abortion because you do not want to deal with having a special needs kid. \n\nMy only point is: it\u2019s good to know where you stand, but don\u2019t take a definitive decision before you get to the point that you need to decide. I also thought I would never want a special needs child because I would not be able to give it the care and love it needs.
