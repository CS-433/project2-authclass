I appreciate them for that, because you need to have that in the back of your mind when you do these things.\n\nBut I disagree with you about the value you assign to a music degree. Respectfully, I think you are entirely misled. What you don\u2019t want is your son to be a music teacher. Guess what, a large percentage of music students do not have that as a career goal. My plan is to study music because I am passionate about it and want to learn more. I\u2019d like to audition for professional orchestras and take the performance route (which is often at a reasonable salary), but if it doesn\u2019t work out, I can write the LSAT or MCAT and go to law school or med school. Or, I can do something completely different altogether. And if I don\u2019t end up in music as a job, I learned extremely valuable skills and grew as a person under the pressure in music academia. I will never regret my decision because I am doing something that is meaningful to me every day instead of enduring something else.\n\nAs for finances, there are many merit-based and  need-based scholarships available. Help your son figure out how to access these and apply. Let him audition and see what he is offered. Do not dismiss his potential as not being worth your dollar. You don\u2019t get to choose what he does with his adult life. You only get to choose to support him.\n\nLook into Canadian universities like McGill, UofT, MUN, Western, Acadia.
