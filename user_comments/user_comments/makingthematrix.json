The movie is based on a book from the 19th century that is even more black-and-white, and the producers actually softened this aspect, but it's still visible. Yet, there is something in the Eastern European culture that lets us see the Ukrainian side as the more honest one in their actions, while Poles can be seen as too confused by their own sophistication and no longer able to distinguish good from evil. There's a love triangle and the plot around it that emphasises those differences and, in my personal opinion, it gives a lot of credit to the Cossack antihero of the movie.\n\nThe movie was produced in 1999 but I think it aged well.

People live in villages, only a bit above the level of basic subsistence. There is no money - the way to trade is to barter and to make promises of future payback. In such economy, people living in the same village are more or less expected to help one another in need and perform work that is required at the moment. In return they can expect others to support them if needed. The trade between villages works because people know each other, or someone who knows someone, and if a person cheats or breaks promises, the gossip will spread. Such a person will eventually be exiled from their village, their belongings taken away and distributed, and they will have to either live in wilderness - which hardly ever ends well - or try to convince people of another village to take them in. \n\nAccording to my research, this seems to be a version of an economic order that was pretty likely among prehistoric societies before more complex law systems arose and before people started to have an intermediate medium of trade, i.e. money.

In most of ihs works the monotheism of his mythology is almost invisible. Meanwhile, C. S. Lewis does everything he possibly can to ensure that the reader knows that Aslan is Jesus.\n\nOne other author using monotheism extensively in his fantasy works is Harry Turtledove in his Videssos cycle. Videssos is a very thin allegory of the Byzantine empire (Turtledove specializes in Byzantine history). The main religion of Videssos is a version of Christianity and in vibes of early Middle Ages, other countries and peoples of his world believe in different versions of it and accuse each other of heresy. The trick is that, as in real world, we don't really know the truth. Even in a world where magic and demons exist, it is still possible that someone claiming to be a messenger of God is a liar. \n\nPersonally, I wouldn't mind reading a fantasy novel with monotheism as a main part of the mythology and story, but I'm afraid it's easy to do it wrong. Stories run on conflict between either two sides similar in strength, or a powerful villain opposed by a team of weaker good characters. If there is an omnipowerful God, it immediately creates a logical hole: why we even have a conflict if God can blick and make it right? So, to avoid that, the author usually creates a bunch of artificial rules but that's... that's just boring.

It's a bit like history novel from another world. People there have their ideas about gods and life after death - quite a lot, actually, it's an important feature of the novel - but they all can be explained as myths.\n\nMy research went two ways. One was about Rwanda, Burundi, Uganda, and eastern Congo basin. I was mostly interested in times before the Europeans came, but for obvious reasons we don't have much information about it, and the archeological findings are also rare. Anyway, I learned about the culture, the split between pastoral and farming societies, and how that developed in different areas and different tribes. It gave me an idea about two tribes who are very similar in all aspects but they are in conflict nevertheless. It's a classic hate-spiral where people fight because they want to avenge their parents and grandparents who were killed or hurt in a war of the previous generation. There is some kind of aristocracy in this world but it's not very developed, and I tell the story mostly from the point of view of common people. There's a lot about their work and struggles especially those being the direct result of the war and then one of the tribes winning it and oppressing the other. Some of them recognize that it still doesn't mean everyone from the other tribe is an enemy, but for many the two are the same. The storyline is about trying to make things right again, but for different people \"right\" means different things.\n\nMy other research was about Neolithic technology. There is sort of a forgotten civilisation setting to the story. The two tribes live in a large valley surrounded by mountains and desert. Nobody knows what's outside - some went to check but either came back without learning anything, or never came back. So they live as farmers, herders, fishermen, and so on. There is some specialization of work but almost everyone works a few jobs, as is necessary for their villages to be self-sufficient. The tools are made of stone, wood, bone, and horn. Huts are built with clay. They know pottery and use wick extensively, but there is no wheel, no horses, no writing, and no for many other things which we take for granted. I tried to make it an integral part of the story - that they live in a world very different from ours - and I hope I did it right :)\n\nRecently I gave a talk about it in a pub where I wrote a big part of the novel.

It moves a lot of checks that should be performed by a compiler to the runtime. The strength of Java was always that a lot of bugs could be found or avoided in the compile time, but if you use reflection, you can't rely on the compiler so much anymore. It also makes static code analysis, and therefore compile time optimisation, a lot harder if not impossible.\n\nIn short, I would advise against using reflection if you can.\n\nBy the way, instead of Spring, take a look at Micronaut.

It's a language from a separate branch of Romance languages and even though it's sometimes grouped closer to French than Spanish, it really has its own sound that makes it distinctive. It's closest sibling is Catalan.\n\nIt originated on the west Mediterranean coast. Those lands were a part of the Roman republic much earlier than the rest of Gaul, so early that Romans called it \"Provincia\", literally \"the province\", the first real Roman territory outside Italy. It's said that people there spoke Latin so well that aristocratic families from Rome liked to hire Latin teachers from Provincia instead of actual Romans.\n\nAfter the western Empire fell, the Mediterranean coast was left comparatively rich and populated. Their language changed less from common Latin than more to the North. In time they developed poetry and songs that were known in the whole western Europe during middle ages. Minstrels - or troubadours - sung in Occitan.\n\nThe name of the language comes from Dante. He wrote once that the Romance languages are divided into those where \"yes\" is spoken as \"o\u00efl\" (Old French), \"si\" (Italian), and \"oc\" (Occitan). \n\nLater, there was a war in the southern France and local lords lost against the king in Paris. Parisian French became more important and Occitan started to be only a language of villagers. Even later, in the 19th century, even villagers started to learn standard French in schools. \n\nI'm very interested in history and for a few years I wrote a blog in Polish about French history and language. I believe learning Occitan is a way to see both in a new way.

But since now Augustus had them all, there was nobody to keep him in check. On top of that, Augustus ruled for 41 years - the whole generation of senators came and went under his rule, until when he was dead, the new generation assumed it natural that they should have another emperor, or rather \"princeps\", the first citizen. But for the whole time there was still the Senate that had considerable power, only that the emperor was able to force them to do as he willed.\n\nIn some ways, we can even say that the Roman Republic was an empire. There was no \"emperor\" per se, but as you can see, an emperor in the early Roman Empire was just someone who merged different political and religious roles. Before that those roles could were handled by different people. In practice, the difference wasn't that big. (In fact, even the title \"emperor\" and \"empire\" come from Latin \"imperium\" - a political role of the commander of all legions).\n\nOn the other hand, Persia under Cyrus the Great was an empire ruled at the top in a more monarchical way, but under it the power was distributed to satraps - governors of provinces who often came from the native people of the lands they ruled. They had a lot of autonomy in how they ruled their provinces and often took councel from delegates of the local communities, since they were close to them.\n\nSo, yes, it's completely okay for an empire to be democratic in various ways. In fact, our modern idea that in the history there were tyrants and kings everywhere is pretty anachronistic.

I trained aikido for ten years, then I switched to Dutch-style kickboxing for the last three. Even before I was aware of problems in the aikido community. The perspective from kickboxing just confirmed my opinions.\n\nI think the most important problem is lack of honesty in the aikido community. Sure, we mostly train aikido for different reasons than people train BJJ, MMA, or MT. In short, we do it for personal development, they do it for competition and/or self-defense. And it's all okay, as long as we're honest about it. But at least some of us, and these are unfortunately the voices that are heard in other martial arts communities, pretend that aikido is also great for competition and self-defense.\n\nDefinitions. Most people who start learning martial arts, especially in young age, do it for competition and/or self-defense. They want to learn how to defend themselves and how to punch back, either in the ring or on the streets. Most likely both. And even those who mention personal development as their main motivation still are likely to agree that it would be good to be able to defend oneself. (I exclude here children subscribed to karate or taekwondo classes by their parents). And then comes out an experienced aikido guy and starts to deliberate: \"What is the purpose of martial arts?\", \"What is self-defense?\", \"What is real?\". And outsiders are like \"Dude...\". This kind of reaction is pretty common among aikido practitioners and it comes across as patronizing and as a deliberate effort to muddle the waters to hide their own lack of practical experience. So people decide it's no use to argue, go train somewhere else, and they learn to associate aikido with overthinking and self-delusion.\n\nContext. Yes, different martial arts work in different contexts. Especially the ones where competition is the main goal, they tend to train within some artificial rules used in the competition and their practitioners tend to  biased when they try to judge other martial arts. But it's still not quantum physics. We all still move in the context of how to defend ourselves and we can see how close those rules fit into realistic scenarios. Like, okay, modern BJJ usually means that two guys lie one on top of the other and they are not allowed even to punch the other guy in the nuts, and that's not realistic, but it doesn't give aikido a free card out of jail. No matter how we define \"realistic\" exactly, it needs to include situations when we are at risk of getting punched, kicked, or thrown to the ground. People come to train martial arts because they want to handle such situations better than those who don't. This is the common core of all the contexts and a) aikido is bad at teaching people how to do that, b) many aikidokas pretend it does which is bs and people see through it.\n\nBy the way, I don't think \"but what about the swords\" is a good counterargument here. It takes us directly to that aikidokas deliberately muddle the waters. Swordfighting in the 21st century is not a martial art anymore, it's historical reenactement.\n\nPressure testing / complacency / effectiveness. Yup, we don't do pressure testing. Uke is expected to be complacent and when they aren't, they are blamed for it. It leads to that within the community aikidokas are considered more advanced when they are able to perform techniques more beautifully, but from the outsider's point of view it's all just a performance. It's unrealistic. It wouldn't work outside an aikido dojo. And then an aikido guy comes out and says \"oh, but these are for performance, the realistic versions are different\". But do we ever train those realistic versions? No. Do we actually have them or do we just pretend we have them? Again, lack of honesty.\n\nYouth. Or rather the opposite, age. The aikido community is old. Young people don't join so often as years ago. And old people have different priorities. A dojo becomes a place to come to relax, move a bit because it's good for health, and meet a group of friends. And then there's this idea of a social ladder with kyus and dans, and climbing it feels good. It's a form of a personal development. But it's no longer a martial art. It's a chess club in hakamas. But, again, we pretend that having a higher rank means we're better martial artists. We would like to be seen as on the same shelf as high ranking practitioners of BJJ, MMA or MT, even though for them getting and staying where they are means a life of stress, pain, sweat, and risk of injuries, and we don't want to have anything to do with that part. (Which, by itself, it's all good - let's just drop the pretense).\n\nAnd I think the part I mostly don't agree with u/Remote_Aikido_Dojo is that about \"they have never seen aikido\". Aikido is what we train on the mat. That's all. It is all there is. It's not as if we train one thing in the dojo and then when time comes we will do another.

I think it means that there's no good way to make aikido into a sport where both opponents have to both attack each other. We just don't train for that.\n\nI think aikido works best as a traditional martial art which you practice for your self-development, being a part of a community, and because it looks cool. If this is what you want and you're honest about it, it's great. Many people train karate for these reasons as well.\n\nBut because of lack of competition and general culture of disregarding practicality, aikido has a bad reputation among more sport and self-defense oriented martial arts. And I agree. I would like to keep my aikido practical. I believe there are quite a few techniques that can be useful in self-defense situations, but some don't, and the way we practice needs to change. There need to be more cross-training with other martial arts, we need ways to test our techniques, and so on.\n\nWe have a group on Facebook, \"Aikido - the Martial Side\", where people discuss it, there's Modern Aikidoist Podcast, and some more materials on the internet from several aikido masters who have similar ideas.", "created_utc": "1660664120.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ikj523n", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_wpw1lg", "parent_id": "t1_ikj1i2a", "score": "4", "subreddit": "karate", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qo6l"}, {"author": "makingthematrix", "body": "I trained aikido for around 10 years total, then kickboxing for 3 years, and now I'm thinking how can I bring them together, probably with some help from ashihara karate.

It's possible to do it only if you want to say that \"\\[noun 1\\] is \\[noun 2\\]\". Otherwise you need to use \"to be\".\n\nFor example:\n\n1. Robert Lewandowski jest pi\u0142karzem. (Robert Lewandowski is a soccer player) is the same as\n2. Robert Lewandowski to pi\u0142karz.\n\nIn the first version you need to conjugate \"by\u0107\" (to be) for the 3 person singular \"jest\" (is) and you need to decline \"pi\u0142karz\" (a soccer player) to the instrumental case \"pi\u0142karzem\". In the second version \"to\" never changes and for the noun you just the nominative case, so of course it's much simpler for a learner.\n\nThe problem is, you still need to learn how to conjugate \"by\u0107\" and how to decline what's behind it, and on top of that, you need to remember that the \"to\" version can be used only in this one specific case. At least once I was asked if \"to\" is a verb and means \"to be\". But no. For example, in \"Polska flaga jest bia\u0142o-czerwona\" (\"The Polish flag is white and red\"), you can't use \"to\", because \"bia\u0142o-czerwona\" is an adjective.\n\nBut then, you can say \"Robert Lewandowski to znany pi\u0142karz\" (Robert Lewandowski is a famous soccer player) because \"znany pi\u0142karz\" functions in the sentence as one noun-like unit, even though \"znany\" is an adjective.", "created_utc": "1659509769.0", "edited": "1659510151.0", "id": "iir3bd1", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_weswzu", "parent_id": "t3_weswzu", "score": "2", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "makingthematrix", "body": "I think maybe the most important difference is that: Everyone has a tendency to see the world as us vs them.

A big problem with native programs is that every platform they are supposed to run on do things a bit differently. If you look into the source code of programs written in C or C++, you will find a lot of macro clauses in the manner of \n```\nIF <we are on the platform A> THEN\n  <use this function, import this header, etc > \nELSIF <platform B> THEN\n  <use something else> \nELSIF <platform C> THEN\n   ...\nELSIF ...\n...\n```\nMaintaining code like that is a thing of nightmares. Every change, every bugfix, must be tested against a list of platforms. Often these tests can't be even run on the same machine - different platforms mean different CPU, different graphic cards, different operating systems,  etc.\n\nJava migrates all that testing to JVM and guarantees that if you write a program that runs on a JVM, then you don't need to maintain and test different versions for different platforms. \nIf instead you use a native image, that responsability is kinda back on you. The native image is much easier to use than having macro clauses for every platform, but it still means you will create a separate executable for each platform and to do that you will set a lot of options in the native image builder. To be safe, you then need to test each of them. And you need to distribute them separately, so that users can find a matching executable for each of their platforms. In short, more work on you. \n\nThe second big reason is that JIT can be faster than AOT. Yes, you read that right. A native image is created once so it will work the same every time it is executed. It will start faster than JIT, and it will be faster initially, but JIT can analyze how the program is used *while the program is working* and can recompile certain parts of it for performance, swap the old piece with the new, and now suddenly your JIT program is faster than its AOT equivalent, because it's better suited for the current use case.", "created_utc": "1659273261.0", "edited": "False", "id": "iidmlga", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_wcmw9w", "parent_id": "t1_iidg83g", "score": "4", "subreddit": "java", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhd7"}, {"author": "makingthematrix", "body": "Tell me where is Gandalf, for I have much desire to speak with him.", "created_utc": "1659258099.0", "edited": "False", "id": "iid1h0d", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_wcb1yq", "parent_id": "t3_wcb1yq", "score": "1", "subreddit": "worldbuilding", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rd6n"}, {"author": "makingthematrix", "body": "That seems like a neurobiology question :) The ways the brain learns things are complex and not yet understood in detail.

It's something that drives a lot of conflict on Earth even though deep down it's based on very simple, even pre-human mentality of \"us vs them\". We know that bands of chimpanzees can wage war among themselves, and if one of the bands loses but is not completely killed off, and have time to regroup, the chimps will remember the past war as injustice and will try to get vengeance in the future. And humans do the same. In a lot of wars an important motivation is that the one side waged war against the other in the past, and that war was waged because of another war, even more in the past, and so on.\n\nBut, unlike chimpanzees, humans are quite imaginative about what can they do with conquered enemies. We don't just kill them off, we also enslave them in various ways. That creates much more complex dynamics: the enslaved people may try to rise up, but also after many failed attempts some of them may decide it's too much and being a slave or a lower caste is how their life will be forever. Then there can be a conflict between them and wannabe insurgents. Some people may even turn into collaborants. Then, the conquerors may come up with many justifications for the new situation, cultural or religious, and they may create an elaborate system for the conquered to climb up the social ladder to some extent, thus preventing further uprisings by giving an illusion of justice.\n\nAnd then, if an uprising succeed, the situation may turn around. The new people at the top have to deal with both the old masters inside the territory they rule over, and possibly with an enemy outside that territory, preparing for another war.\n\nOr maybe a war doesn't end with a subjugation of one group by the other, but with mutual casualties so big that every family has a story of one of the members being brutally killed, and that memory fosters into hatred in the next generation, leading to a new war. If there are immigrants from one of these countries in the other, they may be discriminated against because of that hatred.\n\n So, in my story, I tried to pick up the very essence of this. There are two tribes living in one big valley. They constantly fight with each other or live in fragile truce. There are many stories about why they hate each other but nobody really remembers anymore how it all started. Every memory of injustice from the past is a memory of a world where the two tribes already hated each other. \n\nAnd then there's a war and one of the tribe wins completely, turning the other into second-class citizens. After some time and uprising starts. Some of my characters who take part in this uprising wish only to go back to the old situation when they were free, but it turns out that it's not that easy.", "created_utc": "1657880301.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ig8vh36", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_vz7wpp", "parent_id": "t3_vz7wpp", "score": "1", "subreddit": "worldbuilding", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rd6n"}, {"author": "makingthematrix", "body": "My comment is exactly about that I don't struggle :) Berlin is an international city, just as many other big cities in Europe.

Colors don't exist in reality, there's only light spectrum of waves going from a lower to a high frequency. In our eyes we have three groups of nerve cells which get stimulated by light of or near a given frequency - low, medium, or high. Those nerves send signals to the brain and the brain interprets those signals as colors - red, green, or blue. The colors we see come from mixing those signals. They exist only in our brain. \n\nIn a similar way, a brain is a network of neurons, evolved to help the organism to survive. It can memorize signals that came to it before, its own reactions to these signals, and the outcome for the organism. It can then use that memory to generate a better reaction next time when a similar pattern of signals will come. During this process, because the brain works all the time, previous results become in part the input for later memories and reactions. The brain is able to react to its own previous actions and remember that it was it what made these actions.

So you will have der Hund (nom., the dog), des Hundes (gen. of the dog), dem Hund (dat. to the dog), den Hund (acc. the dog), and then in plural die Hunde, der Hunde, den Hunden, die Hunde. As you see, there are some changes to the noun \"Hund\", but not much, while usually it's the pronoun or article that carry the information about the case. \n\nIn Slavic languages we don't use pronouns that much - there are possessive pronouns alright, but no definite and indefinite articles. On the other hand, nouns are declined all over the place. In Polish: pies, psa, psu, psa, o psie, z psem, psie.

It's one more, a different way of doing magic, outside of the hard-soft spectrum.\n\nI think the hard magic systems, while we can appreciate them when they're elaborate and consistent, strip away the element of unknown which contributes a lot to the air of the novel. The results of spells become too predictable and some scenes turn into tutorials of how to do magical stuff. It's a fantasy counterpart of hard SF focused on how space ship engines work.\n\nOn the other hand, if the author keeps the element of unknown, they can make the storyline more horror-esque, with the magician slowly becoming insane or possessed, or by blurring the line between reality and imagination, both of the magician and of other characters. If they still want to be elaborate, they can focus more on demonology and cosmology of the world, etc.\n\nOr, one more analogy I came up with just a moment ago:A hard system of magic is like a programming language. The author teaches the reader how the magician codes their spells.A soft system of magic is like a graphical user interface.

And that's alright. I would like to just give an argument about why this approach you push against is popular and why I support it. \n\nIn a way, this \"relaxed\" approach is already a counter-movement against a very schematic and rigid methodology of language learning that developed in the 19th and early 20th century Europe. That previous approach was very strict, top-down, and measured the progress of students by creating levels, making exams, and comparing their level of knowledge and fluency to each other. \n\nThe push back against it - something that you push back against now - was based on the idea that this strict approach is very artificial and unnatural. According to this approach, learning languages is a natural skill, like learning to walk and run and jump. Our brains evolved to be skillful in this and for thousands and thousands of years we didn't need a bunch of university professors telling us how to learn languages and who is better than who. So we don't need them still.\n\nThe idea that we all have a natural potential for learning languages means also that each one of us does it a bit differently. So comparisons are difficult if not at all meaningless. Especially when we try to compare a native speaker and someone who picked up the language as an adult - the ways we learn are just too different. It's apples and oranges. On the other hand, what is important is not to discourage the student, and comparisons often have this side-effect that people who don't get the perfect grade decide it's not worth to continue learning. We, people supporting this new approach, want to prevent that.\n\nIn the end, after all, language learning is a personal activity and each of us has different goals. It's not a competition. Also passing exams is not necessary unless you want to be a professional translator. And there's not even such thing as one objective definition of fluency. I believe that each of us simply needs to answer the question \"why do I learn this language?\" and if we have an answer then let's go, let's learn the language in a way that suits us the best to achieve this goal. It's just important to be honest with ourselves.

But my experience tells me that for the intermediate level different things work for different people, and trying to compare ourselves to others is pretty much useless. And then, at some point, everything boils down to immersion anyway. We need to read, write, speak, and listen in the second language just as often and in the same situations as we do with our native language. In your case, for example, I believe it's just a matter of time - if you continue to speak to the family of your girlfriend on regular basis, you will improve.\n\nAlso, I don't believe comparing ourselves to native speakers is a good thing - it's not like every native speaker speaks beautiful clear literary language. Some of them will lack vocabulary on specific topics. Some of them will make grammatical errors. Some will prefer to use local variants which are not in the standard language.

This is the case of English, for example. \n\nAnd, yes, if we just count words in a dictionary, English has many more words than, say, French. But how do we actually count words?

That speed is relative means that there is no one true way to measure speed. You always measure speed as \"how fast this object moves **in respect to** that object\". \n\nSo if you move with **0.9c** (0.9 of the speed of light) **in respect to** some observer, and there's another object moving with **0.9c** **in respect to** the same observer, but in the other direction, well, you both move with **0.9c** **in respect to** that observer :) But if you want to calculate how fast that other object is moving **in respect to** you, that's more tricky. Relativistic effects come into play. The formula for calculating the relativistic speed of objects moving in opposite directions is this:\n\n`vr = (v1 + v2) / (1 + ( (v1 * v2) / c^2) )`\n\nIf **v1** is **0.9c**, and **v2** is **0.9c** then the result will be:\n\n`vr = (0.9 + 0.9) / (1 + ( (0.9 * 0.9) / 1^2) ) = 1.8 / (1 + 0.81) = 1.8 / 1.81 = 0.9945`\n\nSo, if you move with **0.9c** **in respect to** some observer and you will look at that other object, that also moves with **0.9c** **in respect to** the same observer, but in the opposite direction to you, you will see that it moves with **0.9945c** **in respect to** you.  \n\nAll that \"in respect to\" is very important because there is no one true speed.

In English, to ensure that a sentence is understood correctly, you need to stick to a prescribed order of words and sometimes repeat nouns or rephrase what you want to say to avoid ambiguities. In languages with a complex noun gender system, very often you can just use a properly declined pronoun and everyone will know what you are talking about, no matter where in the sentence you will stick that pronoun. In practice this is very useful in writing songs, poetry, and even novels - the author can play with words on a much bigger scale than in English.\n\nFor example, consider this simple phrase:*\"On the table there was a gun and a book. He took it and went off, to battle\".*\n\nWe understand from the context that \"it\", taken by our hero, is a gun. But is it? There's nothing in the sentence that tells us what did he take. Maybe he took a book. If so, we may never learn about it because he will be dead soon.\n\nIn Polish the same text goes as follows:*\"Na stole le\u017ca\u0142y* ***pistolet*** *i ksi\u0105\u017cka. Wzi\u0105\u0142* ***go*** *i poszed\u0142 walczy\u0107\".*\n\n\"Pistolet\", a gun, is masculine. \"Ksi\u0105\u017cka\", a book, is feminine. The pronoun \"**go**\" is the 3rd person singular, **masculine** accusative, making it clear that we are talking about the gun here, for sure not the book. If the sentence was \"wzi\u0105\u0142 **j\u0105**\", then we would know the hero took the book - \"**j\u0105**\" is the feminine accusative, 3rd person singular.\n\nOne English-to-Polish translator I follow on Facebook writes sometimes about her struggles and a common issue is that when she translates in real time, original English phrases sometimes don't give her enough information.

In the Solar system the biggest moon in comparison to its planet size is actually our Moon. Its mass is 0.0123 of the Earth's mass. That is, Earth is 81.3x more massive than Moon. The Earth-Moon system is a bit exceptional - all other moons in the Solar system are much smaller than this - but its existence is proof enough that it is possible for an exo-planet to have a moon that big.\n\n2.  Small gas planets are called mini-Neptunes or Neptune-like planets (they are called \"mini-\" if they are considerably smaller than Neptune). Two examples of them are TOI 270 c, and TOI 270 d, circling around a dwarf star called TOI 270 in the constellation of Pictor.They are only 2.1-2.4 times larger than Earth and we have good reasons to suspect that they are gas planets. \n\n3. So let's take that as an example. If it's enough for a planet (or a moon) to be 2.1x larger than Earth to be a gas planet, and if it's enough for the planet to be 81.3x more massive than its moon, then (2.1\\*81.3=170.73) a planet that is 170.73x more massive than Earth could in theory have a gas moon. And that's not a problem - Jupiter is 317.8x more massive than Earth and we already discovered exo-planets that are much more massive, even 80x more massive, than Jupiter. \n\nThere is however a problem with these calculations. The current theory says that moons are most often formed from dust and rocks in circumplanetary disks around very young planets. The disks also consist of gas, but we have yet not found good evidence that a moon can form from gas in such circumstances. It might not be possible because of the gravitational pull of the planet that affects gas more than rocks?... I don't know. Fortunately, there is another way - a planet big enough may catch another body in its gravitational orbit and if that orbit is stable, the smaller planet will technically become a moon of the bigger one.

So, let's use Sun as the energy source, either through solar panels, or directly - it should be possible to enclose seawater in some sort of giant glass container, heat it under the Sun, and then cool down the steam. \n\nThen we are left with salt. Let's use it for construction. Instead of having buildings made of bricks and concrete a factory - also powered by the Sun -  can make hollow bricks and concrete blocks which will be filled with salt. It's not table salt, as was pointed out, but a rather thick and dirty mix of different minerals. Sounds like a good building material. We could build twice the number of houses with the same amount of clay or concrete.

For the last five years I was working on an Android app in Scala - probably the biggest such project in the world. I saw how interest and support of the Scala community waned, and not only interest in development on Android, but also support for Gradle and Maven, any tech based on Java interoperability, and even interest in non-FP Scala libraries and frameworks, like Akka and Play. Instead there was a rise of technologies I'm not interested in - Cats, ZIO - and on the other hand Kotlin took over Android by storm. \n\nSo I thought, alright, maybe I should try Kotlin. Or Java, while I'm at it. Kotlin with the Arrow library allows for pretty nice functional programming. Java is far behind, but it's slowly getting better. For a moment I thought that either of them would let me work on what I find interesting and in a way that I find interesting. But there are also downsides. Yes, I could use Java for writing indie video games, but most of daytime jobs in Java are in old large companies, and that means corpo culture and old OOP code. Or even worse - new OOP code that looks old just after being written. And in case of Kotlin... Android is a total mess. It's a topic for a whole separate rant.\n\n(But, for example, I learned to appreciate Micronaut. There is light at the end of the Java tunnel and it's not a train approaching at full speed)\n\nIn the end I stayed with Scala but only because I was able to find another unusual job, on the border between Scala and Java. But during the last five years I learned about a lot of people who left for Kotlin.

I strongly believe that quality of programming lies in simple solutions.\n\nHere's my YouTube series on this: https://youtu.be/FNQ7OsCSpc8", "created_utc": "1651435742.0", "edited": "False", "id": "i6y0ly6", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_uft2ry", "parent_id": "t1_i6xwq5v", "score": "2", "subreddit": "scala", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh37"}, {"author": "makingthematrix", "body": "I'm pretty sure I know what I'm talking about, thanks \ud83d\ude00", "created_utc": "1651433745.0", "edited": "False", "id": "i6xvze0", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_uft2ry", "parent_id": "t1_i6xurg5", "score": "1", "subreddit": "scala", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh37"}, {"author": "makingthematrix", "body": "If you think Cats helps you save time, that's great.

You use `for/yield`, or `flatMap`, when you don't want to accumulate errors.\n\nBut there's also a bit deeper reasoning behind it. The right side of `Either` is what we sometimes call a happy path - it's the path your program follows if everything goes, well, right. In general it's a good practice to focus more on the happy path than on error handling, that is, to write the code in such a way that when you or someone else reads it, they can easily understand what happens along the happy path. With this in mind - i.e. if the happy path is understood correctly - it's easier to reason about the whole program and also about errors. On the other hand, if you give error handling the same amount of focus, if you mix the logic of handling errors with the logic of the happy path, the reader needs to take it all in at once - and that's much more difficult.\n\nSo, with this reasoning, we write the code like this: the central part of the piece is reserved for description, step by step, what will happen if everything is valid. If something is not valid, we jump out of this sequence of steps and deal with the error somewhere on the side, in another method, or a clause at the end of the sequence. In fact, often we can connect both ways. Let's say you validate your movie in a `for/yield` and it fails at `MovieId`, so you jump ouf of the `for/yield`, but then you have a check if the `for/yield` finished successfully, and if not, then you process the original data again in search for all errors. After all, if there is an error, then we don't care about performance anymore.\n\nIt would be something like:\n\n    def accErrors(id: String, name: String, date: Date) =\n      val errors = List(\n        MovieId.validate(id), \n        MovieName.validate(name), \n        MovieReleasedAt.validate(date)\n      ).collect {\n        case Left(err) => err\n      }\n      Left(errors)\n    \n    ...\n    \n    val res = for {\n      movieId   <- MovieId.validate(id)\n      movieName <- MovieName.validate(name)\n      movieDate <- MovieReleasedAt.validate(date)\n    } yield Movie(movieId, movieName, movieDate)\n    \n    res match {\n      case Right(movie) => Right(movie)\n      case _            => accErrors(id, name, date)\n    }\n\nThis way you have a separation of the happy path and error handling, but as you can see, it's more verbose. In practice, in many situations it's perfectly fine to just return that first error, let the user (or higher level code) deal with that, and then try again. The majority of cases is that the data is valid, then a big part of the error cases consist of only one error, and only a minority of a minority is that there are many errors and it would make sense to inform the user about all of them at once. Often that minority of a minority is so small that you don't have to worry about it.\n\nAnd yet on top of that, sometimes in validation it's actually a good practice \\*\\*not\\*\\* to tell the user too much. Imagine you validate a username and a password. If the user is who they claim they are, and you show them only an error message \"something went wrong\", they will just looks closer at their username and password and they will quickly find out what's wrong. But if it's an impostor, it's safer if you don't say what exactly is wrong, because that would make it easier for them to hack into the system.\n\nSo, yeah.

If even one validation is wrong, we know for sure that we will return `Left` with the errors, so we use the second case and iterate over all validations in search for them. It might be that some of the validations are successful and won't give us any errors, but `collect` will take care of it.\n\n[Here's the scastie](https://scastie.scala-lang.org/ODdVkW5JQ0e6NV1BTYAYDw)\n\nSorry I didn't use case classes from your example.

For example, (1) we have a collection of elements and we want to create a new collection of elements based on the original ones. Or (2) we want a new collection of only some of the original elements. Or (3) we want to find the first that fulfills certain requirements. And so on. \n\nInstead of writing them by hand, often using temporary mutable data structures, which is pretty much like asking for trouble, in Functional Programming we can take advantage of the fact that functions can be passed as arguments. So in FP we have a wide range of higher level functions that work on collections and for each element of the collection apply another function - the one we passed as an argument - ina certain way. \n\nThe first example from the three I gave above becomes a `map` function that takes as an argument a function that will turn the original element into a new element. This passed function will be applied to every element in the original collection and then `map` will return a new, immutable, collection of new elements. \n\nThe second example is `filter` which takes as an argumenta function that for every original element will return `true` or `false`. The `filter` will apply this passed function to every element of the original collection and finally it will return a new, immutable collection of only those elements for which the passed function returned `true`.\n\nThe third one is `find` which works similarly to `filter` but will finish at the first original element for which the passed function returns `true`. Then `find` will return an option with that element inside. If the posted function will return `false` for all elements in the collection, `false` will return an empty option.\n\nIn short, this approach makes the code more concise and safer. There's less mutability (ideally none) and functions can be easily chained with one another, resulting in complex computations written in just a few lines.\n\nI talk more about it in the video: https://youtu.be/RX1_EJp9Vxk", "created_utc": "1645479884.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hxvuhux", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_sxydc5", "parent_id": "t3_sxydc5", "score": "2", "subreddit": "learnprogramming", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r7yd"}, {"author": "makingthematrix", "body": "In short, a language being good for embedding means that it is easy to use a piece of code written in this language in a program written in another language which is the main language of the application.\n\nFor this to work, there has to be a way for the main language to \"bind\" with the embedded one. It's usually done through a library written in the main language. The main app uses some classes or functions from that library to (a) tell the embedded language about some data structures and/or references to functions in the main language that the embedded language can use; and to (b) call a function from the embedded language with some arguments. From the moment the main language calls a function in the embedded one, the embedded language takes control. It can perform some operations, call methods/functions written in itself, or use references to those written in the main language, and eventually it will finish its course and give the control back to the main one. On top of it, it's great if the embedded language is small, so it can be called quickly - if for each call to the embedded language we would need to wait long time before it starts to work, that would make it useless.\n\nThis may look unnecesarily complex at first, right? Why not simply write the whole thing in one of these languages? \n\nThe answer is, we use this trick because the two languages are complementary of each other. The usual case is C or C++ being the main language, and Lua being the embedded one. C and C++ are extremely fast, great for writing code that will squeeze everything you computer has, it will display those awesome graphics and animations in your favourite game, etc., but C and C++ are also difficult to write and even if you know how to write in them, if you make a change, you need to compile the whole app to see what you have done. On the opposite end, Lua is slow, much slower than C and C++, but it's super easy to use and when you change something in a Lua script, you just need to run the app again and you will see the change immediately. \n\nConnecting those two approaches, you can write your main app in a language like C or C++, difficult, but fast, and then you come to a place in the app where you want to try out many different possibilities or maybe write some high-level reasoning in short time. So you bind your C/C++ app with Lua, and write that part in Lua. This way you can easily experiment and make fast changes, while 90% of your app is still in C or C++, so it's still fast and your changes won't break anything (too much).\n\nA common use case is a video game written in C++ with Lua used to script levels and enemy encounters. You write everything in C++ to the point where your characters lands on a stage of one of the levels, and then you give control to Lua to populate that stage with buildings, monsters, ammo, etc. With Lua, it's much easier to make modifications to it. Maybe you need more ammo? More monsters? Building in other places? Maybe monsters should behave a bit smarter? Dumber? All those little but common changes are much easier done in Lua than C++ but it's only a small part of the whole game codebase.", "created_utc": "1645458842.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hxudob3", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_sxugbu", "parent_id": "t3_sxugbu", "score": "7", "subreddit": "lua", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qjla"}, {"author": "makingthematrix", "body": "Part two starts here!\n\n* Git and GitHub. Also super important for all your future career, as this is how we programmers talk to each other. This is the API between our brains. Fortunately, this is the same for any programming language. I would install git on my computer, create an account at GitHub, learn how to connect the two, and learn basic commands I can use to work with it: commit, push, pull, diff, log, reflog, reset, checkout, branch, merge, rebase, fetch, etc. It's not easy but it's hugely rewarding. And you will never lose your code again.\n* The build system. Honestly, I hate this part, but it's important to know this. If I started again, I would probably focus more on Gradle. It's nice to know Maven a bit, and in Scala we use sbt, but Gradle is a powerhorse used everywhere on the JVM platform. The first thing I will do with a build system is to simply include all the dependencies I need and make it all compile with a simple command, and have another command to run the tests. Later, when the program grows, this will also the place where I will keep some of my configuration, compiling options, etc. (And for now this is probably all that I have to learn).\n* Backends! That's an advanced part again, but at this point I'm already in the place where I should learn something both about databases and backends. Of course my first game might be only local, but maybe it's time to write something more complicated, or maybe I can just add a backend, and a backend connection part, because I want to store the \"best player\" statistics on the backend, or something like that. This might actually be a pivot point - I may turn to learn backends, and use my game as a way to talk to the backend I'm working on and test it. In many ways, things that I learned before will help me here - all those points above describe topics that are used in all kinds of applications, from video games to backends, Android, webapps, whatever. But backends are complex and it makes sense to spend some time now, choose one, and focus on it for some time. Later I may switch to another, but I think it's important to start already with something that I will like. For Java that would be [Micronaut](https://micronaut.io/) or [Quarkus](https://quarkus.io/), for Scala it's [Akka-http](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka-http/current/index.html) or [Play](https://www.playframework.com/) (in both languages there are many more options, these are just the ones I would choose from).\n* A backend needs to run on something. It might be my own computer and then I will contact it through 127 . 0 . 0 . 1 or something like it, and my machine will turn into a heater, but it might also be something \"in the cloud\". I would look to either [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) or [CleverCloud](https://www.clever-cloud.com/) and see if it might be a good idea to use their services. This will also teach me how to work with a backend running in the cloud (that is, on another person's computer, that's what it is, cloud is another person's computer).\n* On the game side, connection with the backend requires a new layer of code, a library, (I would take a look at [OkHttp](https://square.github.io/okhttp/), but there are many more to choose from - again, choose wisely, young padawan) and also more knowledge about http requests, JSON conversions and error handling. I may also learn curl and/or httpie - these are two terminal-based tools that I can use to send requests to the backend from the terminal, with just a command, and then see the backend's response. It helps a lot, because I can test the backend this way and in the same time learn better how do I need to handle the response on the client side.\n* Or if I decide to dig a bit deeper into video games, this is the moment when I can start learning an actual video game framework. On the JVM platform, I would recommend [libGDX](https://libgdx.com/) \\- it's great for 2D games, which for the beginners means less frustration and faster progress - but there's also for example [FXGL](http://almasb.github.io/FXGL/), [jMonkeyEngine](https://jmonkeyengine.org/), and in Scala there's [Indigo](https://indigoengine.io/). Or, if I decide that this is only for indie games after all, and I want to be a professional game developer, I can turn to the big boys, like [Unreal](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/) or [Unity](https://unity.com/), but that requires me to abandon JVM for C++ or C#.\n\nI think each point should take me at least a few weeks, maybe a month or two, so I wouldn't expect to finish in less than a year. And this is good. Learning things so complex takes time. It's better not to rush it if you want to learn it well. Take your time. Don't get frustrated when something doesn't work. Just try again. I would say in the end you will be much better off than when doing some speed courses. And - that's also important - you will have a working app on GitHub that you will be able to show your future employer.\n\nCheers!", "created_utc": "1645438798.0", "edited": "1645460323.0", "id": "hxtfhpw", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_sxaewi", "parent_id": "t1_hxtfcbp", "score": "14", "subreddit": "learnprogramming", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r7yd"}, {"author": "makingthematrix", "body": "No bootcamps, no courses where I have to pay, no exams for certificates. I sit on the other side of the interview table nowadays and one secret I can tell you is that we never look at these things in the candidate's CVs.\n\nInstead: self-learning. I would probably go with the same tech I work in now - Scala - but maybe I would spend a bit more time on Java to have more opportunities, especially something with Micronaut or Quarkus. So, in my case, these would be mostly working on backends, but also indie video games on the side, as a way to learn and show my skills. But the same strategy works for other niches and other programming languages.\n\nThere's a ton of tutorials and materials free on YouTube, blogs, etc. I would use them to learn the basics of Java and Scala. They're similar on the fundamental level, and then Scala goes full-crazy with Functional Programming while Java stays at the \"ooo, pattern matching, shiny!\" level, but at least for now both can be learn side by side. (New Java, I mean, Java 17 - many big companies still use Java 8 but I wouldn't want to work for them).\n\nBy the way, it's good to know Functional Programming even if you're not really into it - it helps with good code practices. But don't go to deep into it at first or you will spend a lot of time learning theory while not doing anything practical. My approach is to always look for practical applications of what I learn.\n\nThen, when I feel sure enough, I would start to write a simple video game. Just for me, nothing that is supposed to conquer the world. Writing video games are fun and you see progress all the time, under your fingertips when you play, so it's motivating. The game might even be text-based in its first version, so I wouldn't distract myself too much. Graphics aside, this is what I would need to learn:\n\n* Dividing the code into layers. One layer for interaction with the user (User Interface), another for game logic, yet another for data preservation in files and/or database, yet another for talking to the backend (if I ever get to that). \n* Each layer needs data structures and infrastructure around them, and it's very important (and fun) to get them right because this is crucial for easy refactoring and scaling your program up. So, records / case classes, sealed interfaces / traits, smart constructors and conversions, newtypes / wrappers, builders, all that stuff. This would probably take me another few weeks of going through tutorials on YouTube.\n* JSON. It's one way to preserve data on the local machine, but also it's the main language used for talking to the backend. So, it's very important. I would do some research on the modern JSON libraries in my language of choice, and then choose one that is simple and do all the common stuff easy and quick (even if it's quirky on corner cases - I prefer it this way instead of having a big library that tries to do everything). \n* File management. This is connected to the point above. I need to be able to serialize data in my program to JSON, write it in a text file, and then read it back and deserialize to data structures, so I can for example save and load a game state. Same goes for game configuration - I don't want to hardcode magic numbers and strings, I want to keep them in a JSON file. And all that needs to be done in its own layer which connects with other layers with a nicely done API, i.e. public methods, preferably through interfaces/traits, not concrete classes.\n* Databases. This is a bit more advanced stuff. For start I will be happy with JSON, but I will have to learn databases eventually anyway. If I wanted to experiment with them, I would choose SQLite and - as before - do some research and find a simple library that lets me connect to it from my program. (But it can wait - I can go with JSON for some time).\n* For the logic layer of the game, it's important to learn how to handle collections of data. This is where, in my opinion, Scala really shines, but every programming language has its set of collections and idiomatic ways of working with them: creating, converting, mapping, filtering, finding matching elements, using in loops, blah blah blah.\n* Testing. Unit tests, but also some integration tests a bit later, as the program grows. SUPER IMPORTANT. Don't write anything without tests. Again, I would do some research what testing framework to use, and every time I write a new class I would at least think what unit tests to write, even if in the end I decide it's not worth it in this case. Writing unit tests helps to organize the code because they pose some requirements: the code needs to be loosely coupled, so the unit test can test only a small chunk of functionality in isolation. I need to be able to mock some of the methods and classes used in the test - i.e. to simulate a more complex behaviour with a simple \"if this method is called with these arguments, return this\" - and that works great if the functionality in question has a nice API presented in interfaces/traits. I would also look into DI (Dependency Injection) frameworks and learn how one can help me with organizing my code and make mocking easier. On the other hand, I can use my first integration tests as a way to actually play the game without any user interface. The integration tests could be like \"create a character\", \"create a stage\", \"move the character around the stage\", etc.\n* For actual user interface, I would start with a terminal. I want to open a temrinal, write the name of my program, possibly with some arguments, the program starts and I see a prompt, and then I can write simple commands and the program does stuff. This way I can learn about parsing arguments (something like what [picocli](https://picocli.info/) is doing in Java) but also about working with strings: parsing them, splitting, converting into other data, etc. Maybe even a bit of regex patterns, they wouldn't hurt. \n\n... end of part 1, because Reddit doesn't allow me to write an entry so long.

I needed to make a conscious effort to search for something that would motivate me. But I found it - and now I believe the same is possible for any language.\n Here's my list:\n\n1. History. I'm a history geek. History of France is 2000 years, strongly intertwined with the history of all western Europe. From Gauls, to Francs, Normans, crusades, exploration and colonization, Enlightenment, the French Revolution, Napoleon, the industrial revolution, world wars, and creation of EU. It's just crazy how much is there to learn.\n\n2. Comic books! France is one of the biggest and perhaps the most diverse comic books market in the world. French authors have awesome, original ideas across all genres and on top of that it's often easier to find a manga translated to French than to English.\n\n3. Cinema. The oldest in the world. The dramas might be a bit boring - in my experience it's either unintelligible artistic pieces or something about Parisians getting divorced, or both. But comedies are just perfect.\n\n4. Rugby. A very interesting sport, full of action. There is Rugby World Cup in France next year.\n\n5. Wine, cheese, and baguettes. Your don't really need to know the language to enjoy them, but it's a good reason to go on vacations to a town known for great sights and good food. And then the language can be of use. (Also, the French-speaking part of Switzerland is beautiful).\n\n6. Bicycles. Connected to the previous point. France is great for long distance bicycle travels. Literally everywhere there's something to see, either some old castles, ruins, museums, but also mountains, the coasts, beautiful small towns, etc. The infrastructure is great. If you like sleeping in a tent, you will find a camping site everywhere you go. And since cycling is popular in France, I found that drivers are more friendly.\n\nSo, that's me. Maybe some of it will be interesting to you too and it will help you find a motivation. Or maybe it will just help you to do some research on your own and you will find another reason.

They can cut out less important features from the list of what should be done, to create a buffer for unexpected tasks that may show up later. They can let the team use less risky technologies instead of pushing for \"cutting edge\", i.e. unstable, stuff. There are many ways. And it's not only theory.

I'm not a hater. My criticism comes simply from judging how much it takes to learn effect systems to a sufficient level versus how much better code written with them is. How much maintainability can be increased while not sacrificing other qualities. Of course here's the room for educators to step in. If it's easier to learn about effect systems then that balance is tipped in their favour - if I was to spend months learning and then write code better by the factor of X, then maybe I wouldn't see the point, but if I was only to spend weeks instead, then maybe I would give it a try.\n\nBut I have another issue. What I see in the community are not people who go from the point #1 to the point #2, spend time learning at this level, and then an educator comes and says *\"how about you try #3?\"*.

And #3 is difficult so they spend a lot of time learning it without good background in simpler FP and OOP techniques and without even knowing that those techniques exist - and they're not motivated to learn about them. They go to solve problems in this advanced way and with complicated code in places where they could do it simpler.\n\nI believe that an advanced programmer is not one who can use all the advanced techniques, but one who can solve advanced problems in simple ways - not too simple, but just simple enough. So, again, turning the order of your points (sorry for that) I would like to talk to those who jump over #2 directly to #3 and tell them *\"Why don't you just give #2 a try first?\"*\n\nComing back to the original question, about making effect systems mainstream, I think companies are aware of this issue, even if they don't express it expliticly. They look on the job market and on the solutions used by their competitors and often (not always) decide that going the way of pure FP and effect systems is too risky. There are not enough experienced developers to hire on one hand, and on the other hand the companies who don't go this way seem to fare pretty well anyway. So the incentive is also not to do it.\n\nSo, I guess tl;dr of it would be: *\"To make effect system more mainstream we need more education\"*. But also *\"we need more honesty about how they are useful\"*.", "created_utc": "1643275763.0", "edited": "1643277130.0", "id": "huf3uqn", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_sd3yav", "parent_id": "t1_hub6njf", "score": "1", "subreddit": "scala", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh37"}, {"author": "makingthematrix", "body": "I would say Cats Effect has a potential for being used to write code like that, but - as with any other framework and library - it's possible to overuse it and achieve exactly the effect the opposite effect.

There are technologies which are notorious in how difficult it is to write mainatainable code in them, but pure FP with an effect system is hardly the only way to do it.", "created_utc": "1643218409.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hubiynm", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_sd3yav", "parent_id": "t1_huayhq4", "score": "4", "subreddit": "scala", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh37"}, {"author": "makingthematrix", "body": "Okay, I've been called to the whiteboard. I'm Maciek. Hello, everyone :)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Remember the end goal of IO is not to reduce bugs, is to preserve composition and RT. Why do we do that? Because we believe those two principles help to increase the maintainability of the codebase.\n\nIf you say that the end goal is to preserve composition and RT, but then add that you want to preserve composition and RT to increase maintalibility, then this is the end goal - better maintainbility. And better maintainbility is in big part about reducing the number of bugs in the system AND making the code easier to work with, so that in the near future people will be able to modify it - add new features, remove old ones, make changes to some of them - with relative ease and feeling relatively sure about that they won't add bugs in the process.\n\nSo I would turn around the priorities here. It's preserving composition and RT, and representing programs as values, is secondary. What I'm interested in is the final product. An application that works. I should be able to send it a request, modify some underlying data, and get some answer. I'm interested in that it works, not so much how it works. If this is achieved by an effect system - great. If this is achieved by something else - also great.\n\nOn top of that, I'm interested in if I go to you and ask for changes, then how you will proceed. This issue is more about how the code is written than the previous one, and here I agree that an FP framework with an effect system may give us great tools for all that adding, removing, and modifying in a safe and productive way. But it also introduces a difficulty because of how complex it is in comparison to some other solutions.\n\nThe unit of software development is not a single programmer, but a team. We need a few people working together. They need to share knowledge - probably it's the best if each specializes in something, but they all need a common foundation. In case of an pure FP framework this bar for each team member is higher than it could be otherwise. You will have more difficulty finding right people and when someone leaves (and someone leaves all the time) it will be more difficult to find a replacement and tutor that new person to work with full speed.\n\nSo, my experience tells me to make foundations simple. Extensive use of the standard collections library - which in Scala is in my opinion just awesome. Readability. A well-designed types hierarchy, separation of concerns, and tests that together with the other two work as minimalistic documentation, and give a feeling of security when the code changes. And the code should be simple to make it easier for everyone to modify it and refactor it without fear - this is what I understand by manipulating programs ;)", "created_utc": "1643211941.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hub0zfv", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_sd3yav", "parent_id": "t1_huau262", "score": "12", "subreddit": "scala", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh37"}, {"author": "makingthematrix", "body": "Personally, I sit in the middle between FP and OOP.

You start from something similar to Java, then you go through stages, and there at the end is the place where you write pure FP code using Cats Effect or ZIO, and that's the end of the road.\n\nBut there are other ways to avoid bugs and write good code, simpler than pure FP and an effect system. And when we write software, as a team of developers, the goal is to have a working software. It doesn't matter that much what's inside.

I like especially the short form where in a few lines the author catches something that in my mind translates directly to a feeling or a memory, almost as if I didn't have to understand it literally. But first of course I need to understand it literally, otherwise it won't happen.\n\nIn many cases I can find a poem in both the original form and the English translation. That's where the game begins. The original text is written in the Arabic script. I need to decipher it. Then I need to find words in Persian that match the letters. My guess of what letter is what can be wrong, but also the Arabic script is absolutely terrible for writing Persian. Sometimes only half of the word is written, the rest I have to guess. It's like French in reverse. Then I need to know something about the grammar so I understand how the word declines or conjugates and how it connects to other words, so - guided by the English translation I already have - I can find its meaning.

But the way I see it, it doesn't mean that without Google we would have nothing. Instead, Google is the very reason why there is no people and money for other solutions.

The Android virtual machine, ARM, is not 100% compatible with standard JDK - and it looks like a deliberate decision that Google didn't put effort into making it compatible. With this in place - and with Kotlin being the one language backed up by Google for writing apps on Android - if you use anything else, you may run into some problems sooner or later. [They are not unfixable](https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/9739), [but it is an uphill battle](https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/9752), while in the same time everywhere you turn you will find comments along the lines of \"why bother, just switch to Kotlin\". And since Google is so big, this pressure is big enough to demotivate people from working on other solutions. Instead, they work on solutions supported by Google. Which creates an avalanche effect - it gets even easier to work in what Google backs up, and even harder to work in something else.\n\nSome time ago I made a conference talk about Scala history on Android. [Here's the transcript](https://makingthematrix.wordpress.com/2021/03/17/scala-on-android/).\n\nThen there is Android SDK. Even though Java and Kotlin are not Google's property, if you want to write an app on Android with them, you will use Android SDK, which is Google's property. It's virtually the only way. So much that Google doesn't really need to care about any criticism. There's no real alternative so even if you don't like new changes they made in a new release, or - much more often - you don't like that they broke something you used for a long time, and deprecated some other useful stuff, you can't really do anything about it. If we had more players on the Android platform, developers could vote with their feet - go to a competitor when they decide Google makes bad decisions and doesn't listen to constructive criticism. But there is nowhere to go, not really. So you just sit down and rewrite your code to fit with new Android SDK.\n\nSimilar with Firebase. We have an alternative, Micro-G, and maybe even some others, but if you compare how difficult is to develop handling push notifications in them, the winner is obvious. So you stick with Firebase. Or Google Play Store vs F-Droid. How many people even heard of F-Droid? So you stick with Google Play Store. And so on.\n\nI would avoid Flutter for exactly the same reasons I would avoid Android SDK if I could. With React Native, my feelings are a bit more mixed. It is one possible competitor to Google on the Android platform... but it's Facebook. Another tech giant with a history of malicious practices on all fronts. So instead I support cross-platform solutions, like GraalVM Native Image, even though currently they're not really popular.

Not one technical language feature will ever be a major factor in the language's popularity. It's just that we, developers, are biased towards seeing them as more significant than they are. So instead of trying to divide my argument into small pieces and argue that each small piece doesn't matter, please try to look at it all together. There is a renewed interest in Java because of all the new language features in new Java versions; **and** because of improvements in JVM, and JVM is linked tight to Java in people's minds; **and** because of a smart release process that motivates evolution - which is what individual developers like - while maintaining stability of certain well tested versions - which is important to big companies; **and** because of new big projects and good tooling; **and** because there is a group of developer advocates working tirelessly for years, popularizing all of these things and showing people that Java is fun again. There's a synergy among all this.\n\nI'm a Scala programmer so if I wanted to support my fav language I would rather talk about how everyone should convert to pure FP because it's the future of programming and Java (and Kotlin) will die as all other dinosaurs. Which would be false and anyway I don't want to argue like that. I see that there is a renewed interest in Java and I don't want to lie to myself. In fact I like it. I think Java people made a lot of good decisions in the last years and it pays off. As it should. It wouldn't be fair if I was angry at them because of their success. \n\nAnd you don't have to rely on my words: the last few RedMonk indexes (indices?) put Java strong at the top with no hint at all that it will sink, while Kotlin and Scala stagnated well behind it. (and Rust too). \n\nAbout the problems: Yes, I see both Kotlin's ties to Google, and Rust's ties to the blockchain/cryptocurrency hype as major problems. Google is known for abandoning its projects. Kotlin rose to popularity because of Google's support and its presence in other niches is mostly driven by its presence on Android. People try to use Kotlin in other areas because there's a possibility that some developers who work on Android can be persuaded to try their skills elsewhere. But Google recently seems to support Flutter more, and it regained interest in promoting Dart a little bit. On the other hand it has little interest in working on its Android VM to include new JVM features which kind of makes Kotlin look not like \"the future Java\" but rather an offshoot of an old Java version. So there are some red flags. And in general, relying too much on one big corpo is a bad idea. Scala survived without it. Java is too strong and doesn't care. Kotlin is in an awkward position.\n\nRust, on the other hand, is still a small language. It has a lot of positive PR on the net, but it's both new and difficult to learn and master. This combined with the fact that Rust developers are getting sucked into blockchain/cryptocurrency startups, means that Rust is at risk of turning into a niche programming language for those projects. If I was a team leader working at something else than crypto I would have to be very careful about the idea of building a team of Rust developers. Can I find enough of them? Can I find an expert willing to teach others? If one of my developer leaves, can I quickly find another? The answer often is no and no and no. \n\nThe great thing about Rust in the beginning was that it motivated people to start anew. In C and C++ they had to work on top of big old codebases. Here they could write something from scratch. But in a bit similar fashion to how Java responded to Kotlin and Scala, we now see some new energy in modern C and C++. After all, new projects can also be written in them. It's an issue of mentality more than any technical obstacle preventing that. Modern C and C++ are maybe not as safe as Rust but they are much better than they were 20 years ago, and people who already know C and C++ will have it easier to use their new versions (and probably they will be happy to do it). They can write safe code too, simply because they have experience how to do it. So I see here a similar situation in \"C++ vs Rust\" and \"Java vs Kotlin\".\n\nAnd... and I think that's it.", "created_utc": "1635237889.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hi3bmhg", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_qfp29b", "parent_id": "t1_hi2xld8", "score": "5", "subreddit": "learnprogramming", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r7yd"}, {"author": "makingthematrix", "body": "I don't want to be a partypooper but I read the same arguments about Scala a few years ago.

If anything, it looks like it's close to get back some of the developers that went to Kotlin and Scala during the last years.\n\nAs for Rust... it's for its own problems.

Otherwise, if you just assume the code works properly and you start to write test that pass when the code does exactly that, you risk that your tests will pass for existing bugs and will fail when you fix them. \n\nOn the other hand, if you implement a new feature, writing tests for it is much easier. It may even make sense to go the TDD way ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven\\_development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development)) and write unit tests first. Here a good unit test becomes a piece of documentation. First you make a list of how the new code should behave from the point of view of the developer who will use it later. Something like \"if given this and this argument, this method should return this\". \"But if the second argument is this, then the result should be different\". \"There is also an edge case when we use this method while this is happening\". \n\nThis can be not only about arguments and results but also if you have a method in a class, that method will probably at some point of its logic use another method from another class - a webserive, a database wrapper, a GUI view, etc. While writing your test you can mock those other classes and methods - i.e. using one of the mocking frameworks you prepare a fake versions of them and provide them to the class you test instead of the real ones. Then you can create rules for how those other classes should be used and how they should react to being used. Something like \"this service method should be called at least once - if not, something's wrong with my code\".\n\nWhen you're ready with this list of possible use cases, you can write a test for each one. Now, if you use TDD and write those tests before actually writing your class, you will write the actual implementation at the same time. \"Okay, now I should call the method called \"foo\"... Oh, there's no such method yet. Right. Let's create it. And the \"foo\" method should do... okay, let's just code what it should do...\". If you already wrote the actual code and now you're writing only tests, you should anyway be ready to change the implementation if needed. Writing a test quite often lets you understand better how your new feature should work and/or how it can work better than it already does. Don't think about unit tests as something you do at the end when everything else is ready and this is a just a chore. There should be a feedback loop between the feature and its unit tests. You change something in on of them, it turns out it wouldbe better if the other worked a bit differently, you changed that too, you go back, and make more changes, and so on.\n\nSorry if my comment is too long while in the same time being too generic to actually help :) tl;dr - try to write unit tests as if it was a list of use cases of your code and the unit test is there to ensure that the use case is handled properly.", "created_utc": "1634486047.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hgzvzl1", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_q9xy4b", "parent_id": "t3_q9xy4b", "score": "4", "subreddit": "learnprogramming", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r7yd"}, {"author": "makingthematrix", "body": "Sorry, the only thing I see in this blog post is a lot of gatekeeping.
