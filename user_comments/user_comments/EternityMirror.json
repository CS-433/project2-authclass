It's one or the other.\n\nConsider your approach towards the emotion and logic aspects - which one are you confident in and which one are you unbothered in? Read [this](https://www.attitudinalpsyche.com/positions/confident/) and [this](https://www.attitudinalpsyche.com/positions/unbothered/) to compare.

But your input is greatly appreciated.To answer the questions:\n\n1. I'd assume they most likely aren't cis. I guess I'm slowly coming to terms with the fact that I simply probably am not cis, whether I'm trans binary or non-binary, but even admitting to that is terrifying. I guess I really like the comfortable bubble of considering myself a cis person.\n2. ...Yeah, I would. 99% chance I would. I mean, I keep thinking \"but would I REALLY want to be a man if I were to turn out to be uglier/less attractive than I am now?\" or \"could I really be transmasc without stereotypically masculine interests/without cishet male friends?\" but if we assume that my body would look the way I'd want it to, and I could keep the friends I have now, etc., while just... being a man, then yes. Sounds like the best alternate timeline, tbh.\n\nI have no idea why I'd want that, though. I don't find male bodies attractive and I don't really get along well with most cishet men, so... why would I want to be a man? It'd just feel more right somehow. I don't really hate being a woman in a way I see a lot trans people say they do, what I suppose is giving me extreme impostor syndrome (like, I feel guilty for even questioning my gender). I'm just in an extreme state of denial currently and keep fluctuating between hours of \"yeah, I do want to be a guy\" and then sudden switch to \"no, being a girl is easier, let's just leave it\" and then switching to \"I do want to be a guy tho :/\" again. I keep feeling that I'm destroying my life by thinking about this, because the more I think about it, the less comfortable I feel with being a woman. But then I don't know what I am and it scares the shit out of me and it makes me want to repress everything even more and go back to my peaceful cis life.\n\nBut I guess I'm probably *not* cis. And if I'm not, then no amount of stress and denial will change that (and it might come back to kick me in the ass later, so it's probably best to figure things out now than wait for later).\n\nThank you once again, your input was really helpful.", "created_utc": "1655633500.0", "edited": "False", "id": "icxh8qv", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_vdlejw", "parent_id": "t1_ickvfqr", "score": "2", "subreddit": "asktransgender", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r4b9"}]
