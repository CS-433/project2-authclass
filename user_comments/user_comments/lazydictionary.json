The problem is when people don't use it as a starting point, or treat it as more valuable than it actually is.\n\nIt's designed to keep you addicted, to get you to buy premium, and to keep using the app. It's not in their financial interests to get you good at a language. It's in their interests to make you feel like you are progressing. (And to make it feel like you need to app to progress.)\n\nRepeating basic sentences, with no context, thousands of times will never get you fluent. It just makes you better at DuoLingo.\n\nThe way I would advocate anyone use DuoLingo (if they are serious about language learning) is to:\n\n* read the tips/grammar before each lesson\n\n* only get to level one in each lesson and then move on\n\n* do the stories as soon as you can, and do all of them as soon as they are available\n\n* spend more than the 5-15 min a day they push - it needs to be 30 min a day minimum, and try for more than an hour.\n\nThen, once you've completed the whole tree, it's time to start trying to watch/read/listen native content or content aimed at language learners. You could then continue to use DuoLingo as a 5-15 min daily supplement if you wanted, but it has likely served its purpose of getting you to a basic level of understanding of the language.\n\nYou then really need to invest in, or find, a proper grammar refererence for when you have a questions, and some way to actively increase your vocab (making flashcards from words you see in immersion, a textbook with word lists, pre-made word lists for language placement tests, word frequency lists, etc).\n\nDuoLingo alone will get someone to a low base level of language ability, and just barely help you maintain it.

Unfortunately we can't measure \"fluency\" but you didn't say that. You said B2 which we can objectively measure. I'm seeing about 4000 (almost every site agrees) known words for B2 online but lets be generous and double it and say you know 8000 words. \n\nYour whole argument is based on your experience with Japanese. CEFR levels don't apply to Japanese - Japanese is it own beast and not really comparable. All those numbers estimates are for European languages.\n\n>I'm well over 12,000 vocab and it is still rough. Basic fluency just isn't enough to contend with philosophical diatribes about the nature of man, machine, and consciousness, couched in metaphor and religious allegory. There's no audio. It's all text and the 2nd half of the game is told entirely through prose. You regulalry spend over 20 minutes clicking through walls of philosophical text. You said you wouldn't say the same thing about a hard sci-fi novel but the language used in this game is every bit as difficult. \n\nSo in order for a video game to be equivalent value to a book, it needs to wax philosophically and essentially be a book. Sure that sounds fine, but the average video game is not that. The average *RPG* is not like that. That sounds like an extreme exception.\n\nThat's why I said video games and books aren't equivalent. Your exception is when a video game is just a book you read in game. That's a very atypical video game.\n\n>For the record I prefer books to games in almost every way and spend most of my time reading. It's my primary passion. It's just nonsense to think that the medium sets a rigorous limitation on the difficulty of the language. \n\nThe medium does inherently make it easier. You already admitted there is downtime for gameplay. Most games have audio narration. Most games aren't written prose, it's written conversation. Those are just inherently easier to understand than written language that describes a scene, describes emotion and feeling, and also has all the dialogue.\n\nThe exception is when a video game behaves like a book. By doing so it becomes less like a video game.\n\nAlso note that the OP of this thread emphasized the voice acting/narration of video games.\n\n>I promise you reading an average novel is many times easier than watching an anime like legend of the galactic heroes with subtitles which has 16,549 unique words with 6,474 of them only being used once. By comparison The Way of Kings by Brandon Sanderson is one of the highest rated adult fiction books on goodreads. It is a 1000 page fantasy tome and it has only 15,206 unique words despite being over 100k net words longer than LotGH. \n\nThat sounds another specific issue to Japanese. Which is fine, but this discussion is broader than just Japanese. I don't think you can compare unique words across languages, that sounds like a very flawed way of looking at things.\n\nAlso, Sanderson writes very plain prose compared to other fantasy writers. It's probably the weakest part of his writing.\n\n>I'll say it again. Sure most novels are likely harder than most other media. But it is foolish beyond reason to assume this as a truism in all cases. There will always be outliers and one can easily find video games, movies, anime etc. with much more difficult language than your average novel. If you can't you're not looking very hard.\n\nYou pointing to a few extreme outliers doesn't make my points invalid - video games are less language dense, always, and easier than their book equivalent, always.\n\nI think you're also just missing the reference of how skilled the B2 level is:\n\n>*  Can understand the main ideas of complex text on both concrete and abstract topics, including technical discussions in their field of specialisation.\n\n > * Can interact with a degree of fluency and spontaneity that makes regular interaction with native speakers quite possible without strain for either party.\n\n >* Can produce clear, detailed text on a wide range of subjects and explain a viewpoint on a topical issue giving the advantages and disadvantages of various options.\n\nSo if you're already at the B2 level, you need to be reading complex texts because they are basically one of the few things you can't read and understand completely. If you want to argue there are some complex video games out there, okay sure. But not many. They aren't typical. And much of the difficulty comes from atypical settings, like fantasy and sci-fi, and learning all the related vocab, not really the difficulty of the text.\n\nYou can absolutely play video games at a B2 level and benefit - usually in a maintenance capacity, as I said. But for actual growth, you have to push your limits. Most video games are not going to be pushing a B2 player to their language limits, with rare exceptions.

He says that you give up your rights to the government, in order to combat anarchy.\n\nI have no idea why you are fighting this, since you claim to have actually read Hobbes before.\n\n>>Hobbes is explicit that in the state of nature nothing can be considered just or unjust, and every man must be considered to have a right to all things.[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leviathan_(Hobbes_book\\)#cite_note-12) The second law of nature is that one ought to be willing to renounce one's right to all things where others are willing to do the same, to quit the state of nature, and to erect a commonwealth with the authority to command them in all things. Hobbes concludes Part One by articulating an additional seventeen laws of nature that make the performance of the first two possible and by explaining what it would mean for a sovereign to represent the people even when they disagree with the sovereign.\n\nI do not understand this idea that natural rights are only the good rights that don't interfere with others life, liberty, happiness, etc.\n\nBy the way, you know Hobbes had some really bad ideas, right? Like he was massive monarchist, believed in censoring the press, and generally that government was infallible, and that citizens couldn't change their own form of government.\n\nHe's not who we should really be using as an argument in a democracy.\n\n>Hobbes' argument was \"If you assume the anarchistic/utopian ideal that everything possible/doable is a right, as in everyone is morally/ethically justified to do anything they want, is that ideal?\" \n\nI'm not arguing that. No would argue murder is morally or legally right. The point is that rights are only valuable and mean anything if the government protects them. There are loads of rights the government does not protect, and there are rights it takes away from people (and rightfully so). You acknowledge this if you accept the social contract to be true. Because you know so much about it, you already know this...right?\n\nLike if I just quote from the social contract Wikipedia page, it shouldn't surprise you thay it says this: Social contract arguments typically are that individuals have [consented](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consent_of_the_governed), either explicitly or [tacitly](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tacit_consent), to surrender some of their freedoms and submit to the authority (of the ruler, or to the decision of a majority) in exchange for protection of their remaining [rights](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rights) or maintenance of the [social order](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_order).[[2]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_contract#cite_note-https://www.iep.utm.edu/soc-cont/-2)[[3]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_contract#cite_note-3) \n\n>\"Therefore, not everything possible/doable is a right.\n\nBut apparently not every right is enumerated, according to the 9th, so which rights are actually protected?\n\nIt's almost like...the government has to decide which ones they will protect?\n\nLike maybe codify them somehow? Maybe like a Constitution?\n\nMaybe if a right is really important, it should be written into law and not just be the result of court that can be filled for political reasons? Maybe we should have done that for abortion?\n\nMaybe?\n\nLike we can say we have a right to privacy. But unless the government actually protects it, the right doesn't truly exist.
