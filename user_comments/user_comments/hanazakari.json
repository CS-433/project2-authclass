Right now certainly is the time to stock up on awesome books! \n\nSome books I enjoyed this year and haven\u2019t seen recommended on this sub:\n\n\u304a\u3044\u3057\u3044\u3054\u306f\u3093\u304c\u98df\u3079\u3089\u308c\u307e\u3059\u3088\u3046\u306b - \u9ad8\u702c\u96bc\u5b50\n\nThe winner of the last round of the Akutagawa prize. Focuses on a love triangle-esque relationship between three colleagues and explores what it means to work and spend time with others and what role food plays in relationships and life in general. \nExtremely relatable if you work in or have ever worked in an office environment! I was constantly finding myself or those around me in the characters. The humor is also deliciously dark and I found myself laughing out loud during a few parts. \nVery approachable literary read - would put this at N2 or above, comparable to other famous Akutagawa winner \u30b3\u30f3\u30d3\u30cb\u4eba\u9593.\n\n\u61a4\u6b7b - \u7dbf\u77e2\u308a\u3055\n\nThree whacky, horror adjacent short stories loosely based on the concept of looking back on bizarre childhood memories as an adult. Was there anything you remember witnessing as a child that you just accepted at the time but when you got older and thought back you realized it was actually weird, scary or inappropriate? This book captures that feeling really well! \nI read the entire first short story \u300c\u30c8\u30a4\u30ec\u306e\u61fa\u6094\u5ba4\u300don a flight without reading the summary first and slowly found myself thinking what? What?! Wtf?! As the story progressed and reached the climax. You never have any idea where \u7dbf\u77e2\u308a\u3055 stories are going (in the best way possible) and it\u2019s always a wild ride, especially in this book! I enthusiastically recommend this if you are looking for something a little out there. \nThis had fairly easy language as it features a lot of childhood scenes - would rank it as N2 or above. \n\n\u8461\u8404\u304c\u76ee\u306b\u67d3\u307f\u308b - \u6797\u771f\u7406\u5b50 \n\nComing of age story about high school life, romance, and the pitfalls and joys of growing up in the inaka. From the 1980s, it\u2019s absolutely oozing with retro \u662d\u548cvibes. \nAnyone who is a fan of shojo manga or older anime like Studio Ghibli\u2019s \u6d77\u304c\u304d\u3053\u3048\u308b would enjoy this. \nSince it\u2019s a slice of life high school story, the language isn\u2019t too advanced - again approachable for N2 or above!", "created_utc": "1666123552.0", "edited": "1666126093.0", "id": "isuhhx6", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_y75isl", "parent_id": "t3_y75isl", "score": "7", "subreddit": "LearnJapanese", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qyls"}, {"author": "hanazakari", "body": "I meet with one tutor every 1-2 weeks depending on my schedule for an hour.

I will also look up and try to learn any vocabulary I need to discuss whatever the topic is ahead of the lesson so I practice using it actively when we speak. \n\nWhen we have our session, we have a very fun and interesting chat for an hour about whatever the topic is (with the occasional tangent too!). Whenever I struggle to find the write word of phrase something she will gently jump in and offer suggestions or rephrase my errors.  \n\nI could probably meet with her or another tutor more frequently to further improve my speaking abilities but Japanese is just a fun hobby for me and it already takes a bit of time to prep for our sessions so I\u2019m happy for the moment. \n\nI am interested in working with a tutor on improving my writing eventually, but have no idea how the sessions would work!

Once I began reading more, I learned most of my vocabulary from books, but the base I had from using Anki made reading easier. I use Anki now for things like memorizing very low-frequency words, memorizing readings for people and place names, and learning \u8afa and I think it's great for that purpose and my goals (to be able to read as well as an average Japanese adult). I don't think there is another way to be able to learn obscure words and names as fast and as efficiently.\n\n* I learned another language to C1 fluency as an adult that I speak everyday with no problems and didn't use Anki at all in the learning process. I took courses on and off and learned via immersion + writing down all the words I didn't know in a notebook. This language was closer to my native one which helped, but I definitely have a smaller vocabulary in this language than I do in Japanese because of this (I also rarely read in this language).\n\n* I'm now studying Korean and using Anki as a supplement to help me remember the vocab and grammar I learn with great success.

However, I would say the best time to start reading is when you want to start reading. If it isn't something you want to do and don't enjoy, it will feel like work and you will end up not doing it consistently. You will never feel ready to start reading because no matter what level you are at, there will still be unknown words and you will read slow when starting out. But, the sooner you accept that and simply show up to read every day, the faster you'll make progress.  \n\nIf you feel like you want to read already, I would say look for some easy texts on satori reader or graded readers and go for it. However, if you try that out and find yourself struggling, don't despair - boosting your total known vocab up to 1,000 - 2,000 words + learning more grammar structures will also give you an easier time of things.

Though normally a lurker, I'm a big fan of your posts (have even bought a few of the textbooks you've recommended including the Routledge translation course) so it's great to hear from you! \n\nIn response to your questions: \n\n* What are your plans from here on with Japanese?\n\nI don't have any concrete plans at all. I don't live in Japan, know any Japanese speakers in my city or use Japanese at work. Learning and reading in Japanese is purely a hobby and something I do to relax in my free time and I think it will stay that way for the near future. I simply find the language acquisition process very fun. \n\nHowever, there are a few things I think it'd be cool to try one day like working at a Japanese company or getting into literary translation, so let's see!\n\n* How many of those books were audiobooks? Did you read your books while listening to the audio?\n\nAbout 25 of these were audiobooks (so does that may mean I technically only read 175 books depending on interpretation). I have read 1 or 2 books in tandem with the audiobook but I don't enjoy it as I find the reading voice slower than my reading speed. I prefer to listen to audiobooks on their own while doing something else like practicing writing kanji. \n\nAudiobooks are a very valuable part of my reading routine as they help me make connections between kanji I've seen before and how it sounds in my head, and the actual sounds/pitch as native speakers pronounce them. \n\nI wish you luck with your study and reading ventures and look forward to your future posts. :)", "created_utc": "1654527121.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ibdetsj", "is_submitter": "True", "link_id": "t3_v5z4tf", "parent_id": "t1_ibdcq21", "score": "9", "subreddit": "LearnJapanese", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qyls"}, {"author": "hanazakari", "body": "30 books is a great milestone!
