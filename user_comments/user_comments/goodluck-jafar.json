They're good fun and an enjoyable watch but either there's some stuff I don't love or they just don't have a whole lot of substance. \n\nStarlight Express - Starlight Express gets its own tier, because I literally could not think of where to put it. I saw it a while back, and while I fully acknowledge that it is absolutely terrible I had just the BEST time seeing it. So it gets its own category, because nothing else falls into that very specific niche of just so unhinged and really quite terrible but also SO good. \n\nA Tier - GREAT musicals. Might have some flaws, some plot points or songs I don't like, but overall just great pieces of theatre. \n\nS Tier - I cannot find fault with these musicals. I think they're perfect, or as near as something can get. I'd pay very good money to see these and probably choose them above most other shows if I had multiple options. \n\nSuper S Tier - These are shows that really impacted me personally. Originally I just had them all in S Tier but they're really just a cut above the others in terms of the emotional impact they had on me as an audience, and it didn't feel right to demote all the others to A tier. So I added this tier to give a little extra nod to these four shows because they're the best I've ever seen and they really stuck with me after I first saw them.
