Knowing what I know about being a skeptic I figured it was more helpful to suggest pointing out that there are certain studies that are indicating physiological changes and therefore talk therapy on its own isn\u2019t the correct treatment for all mental illness. \n\nAs for why I am here it\u2019s because I\u2019m interested in seeing what lies ahead, and being aware of the issues that are facing medical residents (because I\u2019m a dual citizen and I can vote in the US so it\u2019s important for me to know when there\u2019s an important issue that affects the state I vote in) but this peaked my interest because I\u2019ve had this discussion with my mentors because it\u2019s something that is personal. \n\nAs to why I think he should fail the rotation, it\u2019s basic math, he has not been participating in the stuff he supposed to be learning up to this point.

You\u2019re mixing us up with the reform movement (I understand that my father\u2019s family has been reform for many years but my family is conservative).  Conservative Judaism is at its very core about striking a balance between tradition and the practicalities of being Jewish in the modern world.\n\nThat being said I personally think that the prohibition on mixing milk and meat is stupid when you\u2019re talking about animals that don\u2019t lactate (chickens) or when you\u2019re suggesting the use of a cheese made with one specific type of milk and the meat of another type of animal because that wouldn\u2019t violate the prohibition of not cooking a baby goat in its mothers milk. \n\nI get that ancient rabbis thought laypeople and would make mistakes if not for those barriers but it\u2019s pretty condescending if you ask me. In modern times, it\u2019s pretty damn impossible to actually violate the prohibition as it is written in the Torah (factory farming has made this pretty impossible because most of us do not get our meat from the same farm where we get our dairy) and we\u2019re literally going based off of the rulings of Rabbi\u2018s who had no idea what the modern world would look like. Plus with the invention of excellent meat substitutes the whole issue of chicken and milk would make somebody think that it might be OK to mix milk and meat irrelevant because let\u2019s face it impossible burgers look much more like meat than poultry every will. \n\nI\u2019m just saying that orthodoxy as it is practice today is extreme and that Halacha shouldn\u2019t be based on outdated information. \n\nNobody in their right mind would suggest that a fetus prior to 40 days gestation is simply water in this day and age. But that\u2019s still what determines whether a first born male child who is born after their mother had a miscarriage will have a pidyon haben.\n\nThere\u2019s also no justification for the niddah after the birth of a female child being twice as long as it is for a male child. From a medical standpoint there\u2019s no difference. It\u2019s not like there would be more postpartum bleeding after giving birth to a female child then there would be for a male child so there\u2019s no reason to double the length of niddah. \n\n\nAs for what I mean by more extreme. The rules regarding tzniut have only gotten more and more extreme (pictures exist of Bais Ya\u2019akov students wearing short sleeves less than 100 years ago, these pictures have been doctored in later publications but the original photos indicate that the rules of modesty have changed significantly). We are facing the erasure of women in public spaces and that\u2019s not OK. Banning the publication of women\u2019s photographs even when dressed modestly is extremism. That has more in common with the Taliban than it does with Judaism. \nAlso pants in modern times aren\u2019t strictly for men and wearing wide cut pair of pants is a lot more modest than a pencil skirt. Back when the Torah was written nobody wore pants because pants didn\u2019t exist yet so you can\u2019t say that the Torah said it\u2019s men\u2019s clothes and women\u2019s clothes. Before you try to justify it by saying that pants were invented for men, so were high heels. I am fairly confident that you don\u2019t believe high heels to be men\u2019s clothes despite that being the original intention. Also until very recently (100 years ago) all children under a certain age wore dresses. Obviously this is no longer true but there was a point in time where everybody wore dresses simply because that\u2019s what existed. Orthodox Judaism doesn\u2019t acknowledge the nuances of fashion history when it comes to determining the gender of clothing. \n\nWe are also facing systems that refuse to adapt to protect women from abuse. It\u2019s only relatively recently that Israel has started to tackle the issue of get refusal.

Noticing that they were out of my normal range in addition to my pulse being higher than normal tipped me off . One of my mentors is an ER doctor and he taught me and teaches all of his students that you never leave a tachycardia unexplained. Given the fact I was experiencing muscle aches which I had heard were fairly common with the way that I got infected during and the situation on my base it was very clear that the thing at the top of the differential should be Covid. I had to lie and say that I had a cough even though I did not at that point in time.  Had it not been for my Fitbit metrics I probably would not have known to self isolate until I developed a cough The following day. Thankfully my barrack was mostly empty that night because we had rotations regarding holidays and weekends and most of my barrack was on a different rotation. I tried to get a test that evening but they refused to test me until The following day so I slept with a double mask on because I did not want to risk exposing anyone else. The medics actually asked me \u201chow did you get infected when you are so careful about masking\u201d and I told them that my mask does more to protect them than it does to protect me. Despite the fact we were in the middle of a major wave most of my base was not wearing masks at all. I actually went to the store and bought a bunch of masks and placed them in high volume areas of my base so that people could take a mask when entering a closed area.\n\nThanks I\u2019ve got several years before the match because I\u2019m still applying to school but I\u2019m curious if I can refer to some of these military exploits (because hopefully I will still be in the reserves when applying) because despite the challenges of these circumstances, they are the some of things that have solidified my decision to pursue this career path because It was extremely meaningful to be given that level of responsibility (I was the one who who deciding whether or not medics were called in to address complaints that Covid positive soldiers had, which was terrifying and completely out of my scope since I have no formal training, and I relied solely on shadowing experience to determine what needed a face-to-face consult and what could be handled digitally) and at least residency has duty hour restrictions compared to what I had to deal with. \n\nWhere I live the rules with regards to isolation depend on if you test negative twice once on day four and once on day five. If you test negative you get released from isolation after five days, if you test positive on either of those tests you get released after seven days unless you\u2019ll get two separate negative test results before that. Soldiers who tested positive while at home were recovering faster in the soldiers who tested positive on base and from the information I have they were generally speaking feeling a lot better than the soldiers who did isolation on base. I can only assume this is due to the conditions of the isolation facilities. I wish I actually had data because it would definitely have made an interesting study.\n\n\nMy commanders were all in shock by how well I handled this but it was something that interests me and I\u2019m passionate about.

Desalination plants could be established in Gaza but given the fact that they currently struggle to meet the needs of just the Gaza Strip I am not optimistic that they would be able to meet the needs of the West Bank also if a two state solution is reached before water infrastructure is improved significantly.\n\nWhen discussing fuel we need to think about ports and international trade in addition to natural gas. There is [one area of the leviathan gas fields](https://www.iemed.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Map_A17_en.pdf) that clearly would fall into the territorial waters of a future Palestinians state. This is an important resource now but it requires significant infrastructure that a fledgling state may not be able to finance. This would leave Palestinians vulnerable to the Belt and Road initiative which has China has used to exploit many developing nations through tactics referred to as debt trap diplomacy. Gaza also doesn\u2019t have a deepwater port that is suitable for international trade (I know this is the fault of our restrictions). The cost to build this critical infrastructure would again make a Palestinian state vulnerable to the exploitative tactics of China. The same goes for the fact that there is currently no airport in the territories that would become the state of Palestine. \n\nThis is why I personally think a confederation is ideal at least until critical infrastructure is developed. A confederation would allow both Israelis and Palestinians to have their own laws within their respective sovereign territory with a relatively small set of basic laws that would apply within the entirety of the territory (these laws would be made within a joint parliament that would have to be split along ethnic lines to create equal representation and use minority populations such as the Druze, Circassians, Samaritans, etc. as tiebreaking votes which would ensure that the rights of the minority populations are protected as well as guarantee that neither Israelis nor Palestinians are able to control the other).

It\u2019s also really important for the patient to be old enough to understand what\u2019s going on with them, when you are discussing transitioning them to adult care. The transition from pediatric to adult care when done right can go wonderfully but more often than not it doesn\u2019t go well because patients aren\u2019t adequately prepared to manage things on their own and aren\u2019t always taken seriously if their parents aren\u2019t in the room. \n\nI had pediatric doctors who spoke to me as if I was a med student before I was even done with high school and I liked that because I don\u2019t like being treated like I\u2019m stupid (they verified that I understood them by asking me questions and having me explain it back to them). \n\nMeanwhile I\u2019ve had doctors as an adult who talk to me like I\u2019m a five-year-old and that annoys me to the point where I literally enlisted the help of my primary care doctor to deal with this specialist.

Back when I was living in the states I had a Palestinian-American specialist. I didn\u2019t know this at the time but when my pediatric team connected me to an expert in Israel, they actually got their contact through this Palestinian-American specialist (I wrongly assumed that it was my Jewish American pediatric specialist who knew the Israeli expert but it was actually the Palestinian-American adult specialist). My parents raised us abroad so that we would have the option to avoid the conflict, but I\u2019m a leftist and I realized that people like me need to be in Israel in order to try and keep the extremists out of power. My pediatric team informed the specialist that I was moving back and he knew that I was clearly of draft age and would be drafted into the IDF and yet he was extremely professional. I have so much respect for him and part of my goal was actually inspired by his professionalism. I\u2019m not in touch with him anymore but I would like to think that he would be pleasantly surprised to see the impact that he actually had on me. \n\n\nI\u2019m probably going to end up doing residency and fellowship in the states as well simply because you have a larger patient population that allows for better training. Long-term my goals include learning Arabic and coming back to Israel to establish a multidisciplinary center for patients with conditions related to mine. \n\nAs for why I want to learn Arabic, in addition to arabs and druze who have Israeli citizenship or permanent residency, I am all too cognizant of the fact that there are limitations on the Palestinian healthcare system due to \u201csecurity concerns\u201d (some valid, some not so much) and I want my center to be able to treat patients who cannot get all of the care they need in Palestine. If I speak Arabic, not only can I treat those patients, but I can better coordinate their care with their doctors in their communities.  \n\n\nLong-term I would like to work with specialists from the Palestinian territories to establish a similar multidisciplinary center in the West Bank (so that care for Palestinian patients won\u2019t depend as much on travel permits). In order to do such a thing it would be necessary for Palestinian doctors to be able to get training in these specific conditions (which can be difficult when you don\u2019t necessarily have a foreign passport) so I would have to obtain permits for them to train in Israel at my program (which would only further benefit the Palestinian patients that we would be treating). \n\n\nYou shouldn\u2019t feel guilty about going to the US to train regardless of whether or not you choose to go back to Palestine. You know of the limitations that exist within the Palestinian healthcare system and you can do a lot of good for your people from the US.  From what I can tell, my former specialists daughter also studied  medicine and actually did her thesis on the impact of the Israeli occupation of the West Bank on Palestinian health and emergency medical transport.

The teacher who is responsible for it rejected all the neurodivergent kids who applied to help lead orientation and only really chose people who actually had friends so obviously my application was initially rejected (like I actually had been told that I was rejected). That was until they found out that there would be a student with cerebral palsy who was in a wheelchair and not all of the activities that were going to be done were wheelchair accessible. \n\nAs a middle schooler I helped the aid (Who was also the mayor\u2018s wife and she actually volunteered at the school and wasn\u2019t actually paid) adapt gym class to not only be accessible to students with special needs but also to ensure that it was inclusive (electives and gym class were pretty much the only classes where most of the special-needs students were integrated). \n\nWhen they found out about the student with cerebral palsy they asked the teacher in charge of special ed about how to accommodate this student. It was suggested that the student should get their own WEB leader dedicated to them who would adapt the activities so that they could also benefit from the program. I later found out that initial suggestions of other students to be this dedicated web leader were rejected and the special ed department said that they would not accept anyone but me. There was a lot of resistance to this idea but basically special ed forced neurodivergency on the program because they didn\u2019t trust any other student to actually ensure that their student would be included instead of just accommodated (with a semi separated program). \n\n\nI later found out that special Ed could have simply provided instructions on how to adapt the program but they chose to force the issue because they didn\u2019t trust that any other student would actually implement the changes they would have requested, so instead of providing the program with instructions they simply told them to choose me and then let me do all the work to adapt it. \n\nSo after initially being told that I was not selected I got an email requesting my presence at a meeting with the teacher in charge of the program. He told me that there was a change in circumstances and they actually wanted me to Take part in the program in a special role because there was a student with special needs who would need individualized attention to ensure that they would benefit from the program and that I had been recommended for that task. \n\nThe WEB leaders who were technically responsible for the entire group that I was part of put up a fight over making the necessary changes to the program we were trained on, so I basically told them that my job is to make sure that they do their job and make sure that everybody in our group actually belongs. \n\n\nIt\u2019s kind of fucked up that the only reason I was included was because the special ed department didn\u2019t trust the program to not exclude their student.

My concern is that this will be a double edge sword. If they find that a patient tests positive for a mental illness they might stop looking for a physical illness until they\u2019ve attempted to treat the mental illness and failed to address all the symptoms. \n\n\nThe issue of overtesting is also a huge problem especially when we\u2019re talking about imaging studies.

Prior to that point, a pregnancy is considered to be simply water which in modern times we know is not true but that was the interpretation of Jewish law and we still follow these interpretations to this day. \n\nWe know that a fetus is not considered to be life because you were allowed to execute a pregnant woman unless the baby had already Started to leave her body. \n\nJudaism is very clear about when life begins and that is first breath although we still don\u2019t perform full mourning customs for a baby that did not survive a full month. \n\nWhile abortion may not have been the reason that these laws exist we can still interpret when abortion is permissible according to Jewish law based on the relevant laws surrounding when life begins.", "created_utc": "1664479707.0", "edited": "False", "id": "iqemc32", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_xqd85u", "parent_id": "t1_iq8qafn", "score": "1", "subreddit": "messianic", "subreddit_id": "t5_2sa0c"}, {"author": "hindamalka", "body": "So I\u2019m not a messianic, I\u2019m chiming in from the position of mainstream Judaism (based on my understanding of the laws as a layperson). \nFirst it\u2019s important to acknowledge that most abortions take place early in the pregnancy. If they take place before approximately eight weeks (Technically it\u2019s 54 days because in the secular world we count gestation from the first day of the last menstrual cycle but by Jewish law we would actually count from the end of niddah which is around 12-14 days long, it encompasses the menstrual period and seven clean days after) there\u2019s no halachic issue because before 40 days gestation a fetus is considered to be merely water based classical on Jewish law (if a firstborn male child were to be born after a miscarriage that occurred less than 40 days into a pregnancy, that child would still have to be redeemed whereas if there was a miscarriage after the 40 day mark the first born child (if male) would not need to be redeemed). So before 54 days anything goes.\n\nAfter 54 days there is a lot of debate. There\u2019s no debate (unless a potentially viable fetus has already started to crown, at which point there would be no medical reason for an abortion because there\u2019s no way in abortion would save the life of the mother) with regards to life of the mother. If the life of the mother is in danger abortion is permissible because the fetus becomes a rodef (pursuer). \n\n There\u2019s actually a lot of debate amongst poskim (arbiters of Jewish law) with regards to when a fetus is a rodef or not. If the fetus is actually endangering the life of the mother it\u2019s technically mandatory by Jewish law to abort a fetus A fetus is considered potential life it\u2019s not yet a life because it has not yet taken a breath. \n Some rabbis even permit abortion in cases where the fetus is diagnosed with a disability that is liable to cause extreme mental anguish for the parents. Most rabbis that I am aware of also acknowledge that mental health is a key component of health (in the Jewish prayer for healing we actually pray for both physical and mental health that\u2019s why we say refuah shleima because we are talking about both body and mind) so if there is a risk of suicide should the pregnancy continue (or if the necessary mental health medication is pose a significant risk to the fetus) they might even say that abortion is not only permissible but actually mandatory.\n\nTo answer your question however as to how most abortions are consistent with Jewish law, abortions in the US take place in the first trimester and 2/3 of the first trimester are within the eight week window that Jewish law permits abortion in any circumstance. The laws that restrict abortion make it very difficult for abortion to be obtained when medically necessary it in circumstances where Jewish law actually would require a woman to get an abortion even if she doesn\u2019t want one.  Additionally many of these laws are making it difficult for women to get medications for chronic illnesses because these medications can potentially cause abortions. That\u2019s also a problem from a Jewish law standpoint because we are supposed to put preserving life above all else and yet we are prioritizing potential life over those who are actually living. In Judaism we don\u2019t even observe full morning customs for a child who dies within a month of birth, therefore we should not be prioritizing fetuses over living, breathing, women. \n\nSidenote in Israel you can get an abortion for pretty much any reason (assuming you meet certain criteria or you lie and say that it\u2019s not your husband\u2019s child) up to I think 24 weeks. This isn\u2019t even controversial in Israel so the whole abortion debate in the US is strictly a Christianity issue and I would actually argue that any abortion laws that impose that Christian theology on non-Christians would be a violation of the First Amendment.", "created_utc": "1664479307.0", "edited": "False", "id": "iqelbrh", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_xqd85u", "parent_id": "t1_iq8rdtl", "score": "1", "subreddit": "messianic", "subreddit_id": "t5_2sa0c"}, {"author": "hindamalka", "body": "I know plenty of Jews who have had awful experiences with messianics IRL because (not saying that you do this) they tend to represent themselves as authorities on Judaism when they aren\u2019t.

Most people who grew up in those situations are going to want to get as far away from that environment as they can. Most of them are not going to want to go back especially because if they go back as a doctor their community is going to expect more from them and possibly resent them because they perceive them to be overcharging. We need to make healthcare accessible to poor people and we need to make medical school accessible to poor kids. However we should not simply expect those kids who are escaping from poverty to go back and work in impoverished areas. We need to make people who are privileged understand the struggles of those who are less fortunate instead of expecting people who have escaped from poverty to essentially re-traumatize themselves in order to serve their communities. \n\n I personally grew up in an environment where I was very privileged (both financially and in terms of my access to healthcare) and had access to leading experts. I moved overseas to a country that has a public healthcare system and I chose to live in the periphery because it was more affordable and I was on the outs with my parents. I saw a specialist there who was insistent that he knew what he was talking about when he didn\u2019t (I actually called my specialists back in the US to verify my suspicions with them before I accused him of being wrong). When I suggested that he check up-to-date he refused and got offended. Where I live, patients who are in the periphery of the country don\u2019t have access to the best doctors in the country.  \n\n\nI decided then and there that I was going to go to med school and come back as an expert in that specific specialty, and aim to work at an academic hospital in the periphery so that I could do my part to bring expert level care to patients who otherwise wouldn\u2019t have access. Participation in online support groups for patients with my condition only made me realize how privileged I was to grow up in an area with three world class academic hospitals where I had a world class team of physicians who took the time to make sure that I understood what was going and taught me how to find the answers to my own questions even though I was a teenager when I was diagnosed with this condition. Realizing how lucky I was is the reason that I\u2019m so passionate about making sure that patients in the periphery of my new country have the same access to care that I had back when I lived in Cleveland. I\u2019m actually learning a third language right now in order to better serve this community (I currently speak (as my second language) the first language of probably 60% of the city, I\u2019m working on learning the first language of approximately 18% of the population). Even living here has made me realize how privileged I am to speak English as my first language because my access to healthcare is not compromised by my linguistic abilities. Doctors here study predominantly an English simply because only around 9 million people globally speak the local language so we don\u2019t have medical textbooks in the local language. \n\nI\u2019m not saying that it would work on everybody but forcing woke privileged kids to experience what it\u2019s like to not have privilege, could be the way to convince them to serve communities that don\u2019t have the same luxuries that they took for granted.", "created_utc": "1664105210.0", "edited": "False", "id": "iptt0k3", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_xmzfo5", "parent_id": "t1_iprbedh", "score": "1", "subreddit": "medicalschool", "subreddit_id": "t5_2re2p"}, {"author": "hindamalka", "body": "Why not pediatric cardiothoracic surgeon?", "created_utc": "1664035264.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ipqa899", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_xmcn7n", "parent_id": "t1_ipqa2x5", "score": "1", "subreddit": "Residency", "subreddit_id": "t5_2t8qv"}, {"author": "hindamalka", "body": "I\u2019m pretty sure there\u2019s Psych fellowships for FM...\nAlso make it a peds trauma surgeon so that they can take kids and adults.", "created_utc": "1664030928.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ipq0ihi", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_xmcn7n", "parent_id": "t1_ipoabba", "score": "1", "subreddit": "Residency", "subreddit_id": "t5_2t8qv"}, {"author": "hindamalka", "body": "Probably the CRNA", "created_utc": "1664030836.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ipq0b6p", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_xmcn7n", "parent_id": "t1_ipokkrz", "score": "1", "subreddit": "Residency", "subreddit_id": "t5_2t8qv"}, {"author": "hindamalka", "body": "Make a psych Child and Adolescent psych and you\u2019ll have a doctor who can treat both adult and pediatric patients", "created_utc": "1664030730.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ipq02zy", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_xmcn7n", "parent_id": "t1_ipnyg93", "score": "1", "subreddit": "Residency", "subreddit_id": "t5_2t8qv"}, {"author": "hindamalka", "body": "Also replace surgeon with one who does pediatric surgery because pediatrics is usually a fellowship on top of whatever surgical subspecialty they do.
