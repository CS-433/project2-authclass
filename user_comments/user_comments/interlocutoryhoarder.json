A lot of Americans get a huge headstart on the language by learning the numbers, days of the week, conjugations, a ton of passive vocabulary, so when they go to learn it, it's familiar.  That said, even with all those years of middle school and high school learning, it's a difficult language.

I think of it in terms of value for progression.  As a low spender (growth packs + $10), I want the max return of progression for my limited crystals and energy.  At this point in the game, that progression comes in the form of strong runes.  From personal experience farming C10 in 45 seconds, the rune (and mana) return on the energy is abysmal, and that's because C12 has not been released yet and the rune drops in C10 are balanced around C12.  Whereas, Lair drops are, in my opinion, equivalent to the drops you would find in C12 with the downside being the limited prayer, conflict unity set.  So, I choose to farm Lair and have a greater chance of receiving end game runes or runes that will let me beat C12 on release.  Until C12 is out, farming c10 to excel at PVP while there are people who bought rune packs is an uphill endeavor.  It can be done but at the cost of thousands of crystals.  \n\nBut to address your point of just kitting out units on prayer or conflict runes.  I think people should farm the highest B10 they can for a week or two to get a base of \"Decent\" slot 2/4/6 swift/crit/attack runes, then supplement the gaps in your runes with great runes from lair even if just as broken sets.

You\u2019re not doing the right thing- you\u2019re construing an issue so as to pose yourself with a fabricated moral ultimatum.  Here\u2019s a way to help you get around that.  Blizzard sets rules to play in a tournament, a player breached that rule to deliver a political message that essentially calls one world government oppressive slavers; in response,  Blizzard banned the player.  Unfortunately for Blizzard, the message was a human rights message that has overwhelming public support, making it a really bad time for Blizzard to bring the hammer down to deter future \u201clive stream hijinks\u201d.  Blizzard has a lot to lose by players using the platform as their podium and not adhering to the professional decorum, for one being banned off Twitch.  For instance, instead of pro-HK, what if someone says \u201cfuck Donald trump and fuck corporate America and the disgusting pigs that run Amazon.\u201d  Now, in a world where Blizzard didn\u2019t take strong action against Blitzchung, Blizzard acting strongly upon the aforementioned quote will be construed as not evenly implementing their own rules, or endorsing some messages and not others.

It\u2019s an abuse of the position and the very closeness of the person and conflicting feelings about the situation are what necessitates the NC because nobody else has that same access to your mental state. \n\n\n\nI\u2019m rambling but it feels good to talk with someone who relates", "created_utc": "1558476657.0", "edited": "False", "id": "eodnc8z", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_bqa8uk", "parent_id": "t1_eocv62l", "score": "3", "subreddit": "raisedbyborderlines", "subreddit_id": "t5_33d8b"}, {"author": "interlocutoryhoarder", "body": "Ofc ofc, not trying to be overly harsh.

Same story except the different men, after my dad left her she met my step a dad who enabled her all the way.  But yeah, extra drunk at every big event...graduations, etc. \n\nIt took me a long time to fully cut ties but here\u2019s what I would have done differently at your age.  \n\n1.  Don\u2019t go to school close to home.  You need to get away, but, unless you\u2019re accepted to a very good school, try to stay in state for reduced tuition.  Idk if your mom is like mine but if she is then she will contact your school anyway she can to get info on you and maybe show up looking for you.  You have to put a physical barrier of space between you two.  Also it doesn\u2019t hurt to let the admin know not to give your information because alcoholics can be very persuasive and manipulative and could probably get some low level employee to believe there is an emergency.  Guard your privacy!  You have the right to it. \n2.  Work during school if possible.  Try to save while you\u2019re staying in dorms.  You don\u2019t want to go back home because it will ALWAYS be the same thing.  She isn\u2019t going to change and you will get sucked right back into the toxic lifestyle.  \n3.  Have your plan post-college whether it be grad school or getting a job right away.  Like I said you don\u2019t want to land back home, but you also don\u2019t want to stagnate and work in a restaurant to rent a room away from home into your late 20s.   Your life will require more discipline in your 20s because you don\u2019t have the same support system as your peers- you want to be self-sufficient.  Good news, it\u2019s doable- you can totally rent a room for 5-700 + utilities almost anywhere.  You can swing that on a restaurant salary while you figure out your next step post college- it just takes more planning on your behalf.   Maybe work on moving out of the dorms in your last years.  \n4.  If you stay in state school (and ideally your state has an in state scholarship program) then you should be able to do it for minimal loans.  Dorms, meal plans, and tuition.  Like I said get a job, preferably a server gig to save some money since it actually pays and is not difficult to work at a restaurant at night while in school. It seems like a lot of work but putting in the work will help you stay independent when you graduate.  \n5.  Make your intentions known to her.  When you\u2019re settled in to school, write a letter stating the problem to her in unambiguous terms: she is an alcoholic and you will not have her in your life until that changes. That\u2019s it.  You can write how it affects you or anything you want, but this letter will give you peace of mind years later when she tries to guilt you through your brother to reconnect but is still drinking every day.  You made the choice clear and she chose alcohol.  You can rest easy.  And hey maybe she changes and sees it as hitting rock bottom.\n\nHope this helps and good luck.  Your biggest asset will be a can do attitude.\n\nAlso!!!

Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little \"clever\" comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue.

I think that\u2019s a good move to de-escalate. \n\nMy honest opinion is that escalation is natural and winning and competition is human nature.  I don\u2019t think criminals should have to lose so that they can rp some unrealistic conversation in the middle of a cop chase.  I think the Lean Bois were fine to shoot when a cop chased ppl armed to the nines (a freaking p90) into an alley alone.  I think the circumstances of a cop chase with multiple cop cars and a fucking mustang preclude the opportunity to stop and talk it out.  Koil loves the chase but there should also be an investigation and serious police work about the death of a cop.  A car chase hardly amounts to better RP than a shootout and subsequent investigation/war on class 2s.  Koils death was treated as nothing.  As viewers, a chase and shootout are hype and all but the long term stories and feeling of the heat closing in on your favorite criminals is much better, for instance closing in on Vinny (even tho that dissipated anticlimaticly ((maybe not enough car chases Lul))). \n\nEscalation is natural and has been happening for awhile.  Ppl get better at crimes and cops get a mustang.  I don\u2019t think criminals should be locked up after 90% of car chases because an unbeatable mustang exists.  The fake plates didn\u2019t balance it.  That said, the onus is on the criminals to be smarter with their get aways and not to lazily just drive off or shoot cops.  However, that same burden is on cops to act strategically.  You can\u2019t follow ppl with Assault type weapons alone into an alley.  \n\nCops should RP in a larger scale.  Investigate gangs...have plants...spies...raids on distributors...it shouldn\u2019t all be a criminal caught in the act.  There should be real heat and pressure on ppl distributing class 2s.  Right now most of cop RP is just chasing ppl.   Maybe the state needs to create a fund for police work, such as for paying informants handsomely to snitch.  It would take two seconds to figure out Buddha and the boys shot koil if ppl had an incentive to snitch.  \n\n\nSure criminals would be pissed over having their operations fucked but there\u2019s no doubt they\u2019d appreciate it since they\u2019d have to RP smarter.", "created_utc": "1556027403.0", "edited": "1556039429.0", "id": "elkm565", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_bgbimb", "parent_id": "t3_bgbimb", "score": "11", "subreddit": "RPClipsGTA", "subreddit_id": "t5_3onkg"}, {"author": "interlocutoryhoarder", "body": "Boe didn\u2019t make the cut lol", "created_utc": "1556024247.0", "edited": "False", "id": "elkhopw", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_bg8u33", "parent_id": "t3_bg8u33", "score": "1", "subreddit": "RPClipsGTA", "subreddit_id": "t5_3onkg"}, {"author": "interlocutoryhoarder", "body": "To be fair you can\u2019t linger in parking lot with a shotgun to a cop but yea they could have kidnapped him but then probably ripely would figure out for sure they weren\u2019t Avon and Buddha or they would have had to respawn Ripley.
