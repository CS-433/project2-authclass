I cannot see anything on their device except on iOS I can see what apps they have installed. I cannot see or delete or touch their personal data. If I remotely wipe a device, it only wipes the \"Company Portal\" apps and data. This is more apparent in the Android version of the company portal, which is presented on the device as a walled-off set of applications. The iOS version kind of throws all your company apps in with your personal ones and it doesn't appear as walled-off as it actually is.\n\nHere is [the official list](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/mem/intune/user-help/what-info-can-your-company-see-when-you-enroll-your-device-in-intune) of what your company can see and do.  The only thing that really makes me pause as a privacy advocate is that I could kind of creep the apps on people's phones. I see privacy issues with this; as an admin it is not my business if someone uses grinder or onlyfans or the porn site's member-only app or ANYTHING. Nobody has time to look at that stuff, in most companies, but there are always creeps and micromanagers and people with horrible boundaries.  \n\nedit to add:  This applies for personally-owned devices we allow to join our organization. If people feel uncomfortable, we give them a basic iPhone. No company should be able to require you to use a personal device for their IT infrastructure.
