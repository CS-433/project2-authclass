You can find it by clicking where it says the sub name at the top of this post, then on the sub's homepage, look for something near the top that says \"About\". Some subs have strict rules to follow, and some subs have a lot of resources in their wiki that you'll find helpful. r/languagelearning sub has both!\n* Browse through a couple pages of posts - you don't have to read every single one, but read through the titles, open a few of them, and get a sense for what's already posted/what the sub generally engages with.\n* If you have a specific question, use the search function! When you perform a search, you can filter the results by the sub that you are in, so searching \"A1' in this sub could be really helpful.\n\nIn this case, checking out the wiki in r/languagelearning would be a **really** good idea - there are a **bunch** of resources listed in the wiki under the \"Language-specific Resources\" link for French!\n\n-----------\n\nAn extensive plan from someone else on how they learned French - it's a good read!\nhttp://atdt.freeshell.org/k5/story_2004_12_29_15258_287.html \n\n-----------\n\n**A step-by-step plan for learning French:**\n\n1. Start with Duolingo which offers both app and website. If you don't pay for premium, you'll get all the ads, but it's otherwise free all of the way through (Why: you mentioned not knowing where/how to start with the process of learning a language - this is a very guided introduction to the language from the first words. It's not perfect, but it's a starting point.) \n\n2. After getting comfortable with Duo, search for Lawless French. In the FAQ, you'll find a \"I'm a beginner, where do I start?\" - this will take you to an organized set of lessons. Start working your way through that. \n\n3. Someone recommended a Frenchpod101 - I'd pull that in here too, or Coffee Break French, so you can start hearing the language more. \n\n4. Once you've gotten a good way in on your Duolingo path, and feel like you have a good grasp on basic/introductory grammar, start with Lingvist (free trial, then paid subscription). It will expose you to some different grammar/vocab, SRS-ish strategy, but you can test in at your level and it will start there. You can also put this off until later, *(15 rows of old tree, not sure what new path equivalent is)* into Duo is just the earliest I'd recommend. Shorter, frequent/periodic study will help. Also both website and app.\n\n5. Once you feel comfortable enough with grammar to start rapidly expanding your vocabulary, use Memrise (visit website, not app, to find the community courses with vocab lists) or Anki (there are premade decks you can acquire through AnkiWeb) - find an intermediate deck with lots of words and go to town. Also consider getting a book-based deck (eg Le Petit Prince), so that upon completion you can then read the book fairly smoothly. Moving into community-created flashcards is best done when you have enough experience with the language that you'll be able to notice when some of the flashcards don't look right - I had a deck I used which has about 5% errors, but looking up questionable cards helped me determine which to keep and which to trash.\n\n6. Throughout all of this, use Word Reference (especially forums to search for your grammar questions - I guarantee someone's probably asked it already - but also the translation for a full look at possibilities), and linguee (great for seeing the word in various source materials). A traditional French dictionary would also be great when you're reading to cut translation out of your learning process.\n\nI don't have source material suggestions for your level, look to the other posts here for that. However, I definitely echo the importance of finding source material as soon as you have a basic grounding. You'll be in over your head on some stuff, but that's okay, it's exposure and learning opportunities, especially when balanced by structured learning that fits your level. \n\nDon't be afraid to search your grammar questions, I learn so much that way, and you can find answers for all sorts of obscure questions. \n\nAnd, we all love finding free material, but if something ends up being super valuable to you, consider saving and supporting it with a contribution when you are able to. Even if it's free to you, it still cost someone money to create and host.", "created_utc": "1666382385.0", "edited": "False", "id": "it8w0fq", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_ya2uoe", "parent_id": "t3_ya2uoe", "score": "11", "subreddit": "learnfrench", "subreddit_id": "t5_2sucz"}, {"author": "marjoramandmint", "body": "I do one deck, with 2 (or 3) cards for most notes. I do switch the note type around, so for some notes I'll just do a Basic TL -> NL when I just want to passive recall on something, or when I think developing a card to actively recall a specific word instead of a more common synonym is too much work/too hard/not worth it.\n\nOtherwise, for French I just have one note that becomes two cards, with an optional note section that shows up only on the back side of either card. So, for a phrase like \"tu me manques\" I'll end up with two cards like\n\n* **FRONT:** I miss you.  |  **BACK:** Tu me manques. **Back/note:** Think of this as saying \"You are missed by me\"\n* **FRONT:** Tu me manques.  |  **BACK:** I miss you. **Back/note:** Think of this as saying \"You are missed by me\"\n\nSimilarly, for Bengali I have a new note type I created that has 8 fields, and there are 3 question/answer fields, as the Bengali word/phrase may be displayed in either the script or transliteration (eg dog / \u0995\u09c1\u0995\u09c1\u09b0 / kukur). So, I end up with 3 cards for every note of this type. For the following example from my cards, I left the \"Picture\" and \"Misc\" fields blank, and I have the \"Type or function\" card show up on the front of every card since that's where I'll put clues to the specific translation I want, so I end up with:\n\n* **FRONT:** \u09a4\u09cb\u09ae\u09be\u09b0 \u09a8\u09be\u09ae \u0995\u09c0 ? **Front/type:** (informal, singular) | **BACK:** Tomar nam ki? What is your name? **Back/grammar:** informal - use \u0986\u09aa\u09a8\u09be\u09b0 | apnar for formal version **Back/IPA:** IPA: \u02c8t\u032aoma\u0279 \u02c8nam \u02c8ki\n* **FRONT:** Tomar nam ki? **Front/type:** (informal, singular) | **BACK:** \u09a4\u09cb\u09ae\u09be\u09b0 \u09a8\u09be\u09ae \u0995\u09c0 ? What is your name? **Back/grammar:** informal - use \u0986\u09aa\u09a8\u09be\u09b0 | apnar for formal version **Back/IPA:** IPA: \u02c8t\u032aoma\u0279 \u02c8nam \u02c8ki\n* **FRONT:** What is your name? **Front/type:** (informal, singular) | **BACK:** \u09a4\u09cb\u09ae\u09be\u09b0 \u09a8\u09be\u09ae \u0995\u09c0 ? Tomar nam ki?  **Back/grammar:** informal - use \u0986\u09aa\u09a8\u09be\u09b0 | apnar for formal version **Back/IPA:** IPA: \u02c8t\u032aoma\u0279 \u02c8nam \u02c8ki\n\nI then have each of these formatted so that the question/answer English, script, and transliteration for each is in large font, black color. The other info (type or function, grammar notes or description, IPA or sound, Misc.) are all small font and color gray - so any info in those fields are not taking up attention, but available if needed. I don't actually have a picture on any cards yet, that field is currently just a placeholder, but I'd probably play around with just adding a picture in the English field (instead of words) if I did for any words that made sense for.\n\n>I was thinking that a deck for producing language (ie. to come up with words and sentences in TL) would be very different from a deck in TL where you want to recall what something means\u2026\n\nI don't think the difference is that marked, and it's never been the \"mode switching\" that has slowed me down. And, many who have gone deeper into the best ways to Anki/SRS would even say that it's not just input/output you should mix up - but rather you should have one deck for **all** your cards, mixing up your French with your geography with your reminders of friends allergies with your logical fallacies. You can tag them if you need to, but put them all in one deck so you can better remember things out of context, and build connections between seemingly disparate topics.

I got really good at being able to read a transliteration and write it out in the script  - but only actually knew minimal words like mango=\u0986\u09ae. I also never actually used the audio files, so that might have helped... did feel really hard to pick up as a beginner trying to use the language.\n\n**Colloquial Bengali by Mithun B. Nasrin and W.A.M. van der Wurff 978-1-138-95007-8** - Didn't get very far, but seems like a much better resource for learning to speak, pronunciation. Seems to follow a fairly logical pattern of introducing topics/conversations compared to Radice's less focused on the script. I would probably go back to this one first.\n\n**Lonely Planet Phrasebook Hindi, Urdu & Bengali 1-74059-149-6** - Definitely don't use as your sole resource, and get your pronunciation sorted elsewhere (their guide is insufficient), but could be a good resource for quickly learning some stock phrases.\n\n**Hippocrene Practical Dictionary Bengali** Hanne-Ruth Thompson 978-0-7818-1270-2** - While def not a standalone, in my research for Bengali resources, this seemed to be one of the better Bengali resources. Author has more experience with Bangladesh, but notes in the intro that she's noted the variations between Bangladesh/West Bengal. Is also author of a couple of her own resources.\n\n**Mango Languages** - Do you have access to this? I do, free through my library, and it has been a very useful tool for running through vocabulary/ phrases, and I found myself picking up on some grammatical structures while using it. It won't get you far, but it was a good practice for listening/ speaking, which I shy from.\n\nAs someone who has tried the above starting with Radice, I'd recommend starting with Mango and Colloquial - it gets you listening to a couple different voices, Mango is an easy \"I have a moment\" option while Colloquial is great for a bit more intense study, and Colloquial will teach you enough about the writing system (and how it corresponds to sound) to get by (Mango doesn't). Throw phrasebook in as a supplement if desired, not necessary.\n\nI struggled trying to use both Colloquial and Radice's Complete at the same time because their transliteration systems are **so** different. So, starting with the options that get you really speaking, so you can then sprinkle it into convos with your partner and/or benefit from online tutoring. However, if you want to really start diving deeper into the language and being able to write it well, then pick up Radice's and the dictionary. The dictionary uses the same transliteration as Radice, explicitly giving him credit for creating it.\n\nAt any phase, if you are writing in the script but don't have Radice's book, look up Bengali script worksheets to learn how to write the characters correctly - it really helps! If you've got Radice's book, there's an excellent two-page spread in the Introduction, which is what I used.

Each individual book or only the name of the series? | What about short stories in an anthology you read?* **By the book** - So I list each book in a series separately (especially since I might not read the entire series in one year), and I'd list each anthology as it's whole form, assuming I read the full collection within the one book.

I also never actually used the audio files, so that might have helped... did feel really hard to pick up as a beginner trying to use the language.\n\n**Colloquial Bengali by Mithun B. Nasrin and W.A.M. van der Wurff 978-1-138-95007-8** - Didn't get very far, but seems like a much better resource for learning to speak, pronunciation. Seems to follow a fairly logical pattern of introducing topics/conversations compared to Radice's less focused on the script. I would probably go back to this one first.\n\n**Lonely Planet Phrasebook Hindi, Urdu & Bengali 1-74059-149-6** - Definitely don't use as your sole resource, and get your pronunciation sorted elsewhere (their guide is insufficient), but could be a good resource for quickly learning some stock phrases.\n\n**Hippocrene Practical Dictionary Bengali** Hanne-Ruth Thompson 978-0-7818-1270-2** - While def not a standalone, in my research for Bengali resources, this seemed to be one of the better Bengali resources. Author has more experience with Bangladesh, but notes in the intro that she's noted the variations between Bangladesh/West Bengal. Is also author of a couple of her own resources.\n\n**Mango Languages** - Do you have access to this? I do, free through my library, and it has been a very useful tool for running through vocabulary/ phrases, and I found myself picking up on some grammatical structures while using it. It won't get you far, but it was a good practice for listening/ speaking, which I shy from.\n\nAs someone who has tried the above starting with Radice, I'd recommend starting with Mango and Colloquial - it gets you listening to a couple different voices, Mango is an easy \"I have a moment\" option while Colloquial is great for a bit more intense study, and Colloquial will teach you enough about the writing system (and how it corresponds to sound) to get by (Mango doesn't). Throw phrasebook in as a supplement if desired, not necessary.\n\nI struggled trying to use both Colloquial and Radice's Complete at the same time because their transliteration systems are **so** different. So, starting with the options that get you really speaking, so you can then sprinkle it into convos with your partner and/or benefit from online tutoring. However, if you want to really start diving deeper into the language and being able to write it well, then pick up Radice's and the dictionary. The dictionary uses the same transliteration as Radice, explicitly giving him credit for creating it.\n\nAt any phase, if you are writing in the script but don't have Radice's book, look up Bengali script worksheets to learn how to write the characters correctly - it really helps! If you've got Radice's book, there's an excellent two-page spread in the Introduction, which is what I used.

The 3 'sibilants' that are distinguished in Sanskrit are generally all pronounced as 'sh' in standard Bengali (except when combined with other letters - see Unit 35). In East Bengal (Bangladesh) you will often hear 's' rather than 'sh', even in educated speech. (There is also a tendancy to pronounce 'ch' as 's'.) It is safer, however, to stick to 'sh', unless the word is English (bus, cycle, etc).\"* It then suggests the English word \"ship\" as a guide for default pronunciation.\n\n>**what does the vertical line after letters do? eg: the line after the a, before the mi, in \u0986\u09ae\u09bf**\n\nOkay, so that vertical line in \u0986\u09ae\u09bf (ami) is an integral part of the \u0986 (a). For an even simpler word, you can see it again in \u0986\u09ae (am), which means mango. It may be helpful to note that when the 'a' is written after a consonant it is represented by its vowel sign, which is *just* that vertical line, such as in \u09ae\u09be (ma), which means mother.\n\nIf you don't include that line, then it becomes a completely different letter that is often referred to as the inherent vowel: \u0985 (\u00f4 *or* \u0254). You'll see it written in full at the beginning of a word like \u0985\u09a8\u09c7\u0995 (\u00f4nek) which means much/a lot. It does not have a vowel sign - you main clue that you need to pronounce it is when you see two consonants next to each other, such as with \u09ae\u09a4 (m\u0254t), which means opinion\n\n>**what do the squiggly lines like at the end of \u0985\u09a8\u09a8\u09cd\u09af or at the start of \u09b6\u09c7\u09b7 and \u09a4\u09cb\u09ae\u09be\u09b0 do?**\n\nOkay, you've got two different kinds of \"squiggles\" there. \n\nIn your first example, you've got the \"j\u00f4ph\u00f4la\". This comes from the consonant (sometimes referred to as a  \"semi-vowel\") \u09af (y).\u00a0It is found almost entirely at the beginning of words. When present in the middle of words, in conjuncts, \u09af is represented as a distinct letter:\u00a0\u09cd\u09af\u00a0(\u09af\u09ab\u09b2\u09be\u00a0j\u00f4ph\u00f4la) which is mostly silent or semi-silent (see below).\u00a0J\u00f4ph\u00f4la\u00a0may alter the pronunciation of the surrounding vowel, or double the preceding consonant, or be completely silent. Paraphrased from https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bengali_alphabet\n\nYour second example is the vowel sign for \u098f (e *or* \u00e6). At the beginning of a word, it looks like \u098f such as in \u098f\u09a4 (\u00e6t\u00f4). However, when that vowel follows a consonant, it is written with a vowel sign that is written *in front of* the consonant. So then (mela) is written \u09ae\u09c7\u09b2\u09be. Note the different vowel sign placements - the 'e' in 'me' gets placed *before* the consonant (\u09ae\u09c7) while the 'a' in 'la' gets placed *after* the consonant (\u09b2\u09be). So, (mela) becomes \u09ae\u09c7\u09b2\u09be.\n\n(Don't know what I mean by vowel sign, also known as diacritical marks? Try this page: https://elo-melo.com/2021/06/19/bengali-script-demystified-vowels/)\n\n>**what is the difference between \u099c and \u09af?**\n\nSimilar to your first question about the 's' sounds, the simplest answer is that they are two letters that are pronounced the same. From , page 19: *\"\u099c j is a voiced, unaspirated sounds as in the English 'hedge' with no aspiration. It is called \u09ac\u0997\u09c0\u09af\u09bc \u099c (b\u00f4rg\u012b\u00fd\u00f4 j\u0254) to distinguish it from \u09af y which is pronounced the same.\"*\n\nThe \u099c (j) is pretty straight forward. The \u09af (y) gets a little more complicated, as mentioned in the precious question/answer about the squiggles, but any beginner's textbook/lessons should break it down.

Most of these books I'm getting for $5 or less, though, and and as used books, so this list is costing me about $65-70 total - much lighter than if I were buying them full-priced and new! \n\n1. **One Good Dish** by David Tanis\n2. **Downtime: Deliciousness at Home** Nadine Redzepi\n3. **Ottolenghi's Test Kitchen: Shelf Love**\n4. **How to Cook Everything Fast: A Better Way to Cook Great Food** by Mark Bittman\n5. **Everyone's Table: Global Recipes for Modern Health** By Gregory Gourdet\n6. **Cooking for Good Times: Super Delicious, Super Simple** by Paul Kahan\n7. **Ein Kerem: Exploring & Cooking in Jerusalem's Biblical Village** by Pnina Ein Mor, Atalya Ein Mor, and Michal Fattal\n8. **Ya Amna - From Djerba to Israel: A Tunisian Family Kitchen** by Shoshana Cohen-Levran\n9. **Paleo Perfected: A Revolution in Eating Well with 150 Kitchen-Tested Recipes** by America's Test Kitchen \n10. **The Healthy Slow Cooker** by Ross Dobson\n11. **The Primal Gourmet Cookbook** by \n12. **Keto in an Instant** by Jen Fisch \n13. **Clean Paleo Real Life** by Monica Stevens Le\n\n1 and 2 essentially for the same reason - sounds like they'll have really good recipes that are also practical for making at home, providing different ideas from what I usually make. Additionally, I've really wanted to read through a David Tanis book book ever since his \"Platter of Figs\" book caught my eye many years ago in a book store, so this book should be a good introduction to him. (Sounds like his other books are more focused on menus - which may be good for easy dinner party planning!). Nadine Redzepi is a newer person for me, but the book sounds like it'll be a good front-to-back read as well as a cookbook, and has been on my \"wish list\" for a couple years now. \n\n3 and 4 (Ottolenghi and Bittman) are super familiar authors with consistently good stuff - still, I wasn't totally sold on acquiring yet another book from each of them, until I started flipping through my mom's copies of them and wanted to snag an unreasonable number of ideas from each of them! I'm also hoping the Bittman will be encouraging to my roommates, both of whom have less experience in and tolerance for cooking - seems like it'll be super accessible for them. Bonus!\n\n5 (Everyone's Table) sounds like it'll have some really good stuff, but part of what really caught my eye is that he has various cultural influences in his cooking, including Caribbean and African. I have a few cookbooks that are solidly about African cuisine, but none that borrow flavors and integrate them the way we often find with Indian, various East Asian, and Mexican these days in otherwise American/western cooking. So, super interested to find how that influenced his recipes!\n\n6 (Good Times) sounds like it'll be excellent for dinner parties, and is another that has been on my wish list for a while now. Reading back into its concept, I love the concept of having a core recipe and providing various riffs on it (especially as someone who is super reliant on recipes, and needs to develop more intuition/creativity), so am hopeful that it will help me grow as a home cook. \n\n7 and 8 (the Israeli books) were both well reviewed and maybe $5 *total*, so they were a last minute add-in on my cart. Super curious to look through them each, however, especially as a trip to Israel when I was ~13 included some of the best food I had ever had. I don't cook much Middle Eastern food, especially not like I used to, but maybe these will encourage it again - or maybe they'll just be lovely reads! Either way, worth taking a chance on them. \n\n9 through 13 - while I don't follow any one diet, I love reading books from them for imteresting/different ways to approach food (same reason I have so many vegan books already!), as well as expanding possibities when accommodating friends with diets or allergies. Plus, I do tend to feel better when eating lower carb, so I'm hoping a couple of these will pan out to have some tasty options - especially the Instant Pot/slow cooker ones, as I've been finding myself with less \"spoons\" (for cooking and in general) this year than I used to. \n\nIn general, the concept of easier cooking (but still tasty, plant forward, and homemade) is a theme running through many of these books, as I have traditionally loved more complicated recipes, but find myself needing simpler preparations this year. And, at this price point I can always put a book up on Buy Nothing or in a local Little Free Library if it's just not what I need it to be!

I really like it so far, but as a B2-ish for 2 decades person who really just needs to focus on content exposure, this has been a really helpful way to do it. I'm now both reading a book and listening to a podcast daily, with an easy way to look up and track vocab I don't know. Going much better than my precious efforts to use Kindle or a physical book.\n\nI'm also kind-of-but-not-really using it for Spanish, which I'm basically A0 in (some vocab and knowledge, but not yet fully A1 per CEFR tables) - it's definitely not the easiest to use at the very beginning of a language learning process, and I feel like I'm only getting away with it due to casual Spanish exposure through life/friends and my French knowledge. \n\nSo, recommended if you are ready for content exposure, reading, etc, not as easy to use if you are still learning your first vocab words. (Based on my only ~2 weeks experience with it.) It does depend on content existing, so will likely be a better experience for 1. Popular languages and 2. Languages for which you have your own material to upload. This includes kindle books, YouTube videos, and Netflix shows, which can be added as lessons via a computer. I found a PDF version of a couple books which I already own in physical form online to start with.\n\nIf you do try it with a free account, note that what they call a \"Lingq\" within their platform is essentially marking a vocab word in yellow as unknown by picking a definition for it. You only get 20 on a free trial, so avoid making those while you test the platform (which means you will end up marking some unknown words as \"known\", inadvertently). Once I hit 20 lingqs, I could no longer even look up the meaning of a word, much less make a lingq, so I got blocked out of trying the system further within 15 minutes. \n\nIf you are serious about trying it, I think I got an email to offer someone 100 lingqs on a free trial? Would have to look it up, but could double-check if you wanted. But the being careful to only create less than 20 lingqs will let you continue experiencing the platform, too, or get a one-month subscription to try before committing to a full year.", "created_utc": "1646443608.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hze8snm", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_t6uz98", "parent_id": "t1_hzdy8yz", "score": "39", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "marjoramandmint", "body": "If you happen to be interested in cookbook recs, then *Sweet Potato Soul* by Jenn\u00e9 Claiborne and *Mississippi Vegan* by Timothy Pakron are two with some Southern foods that might make mom and you happy!

To use real numbers, I've got less than 3.5k saved in the portfolio I'm looking at right now, and\n\n* The numbers from my account in my earlier comment are based on monthly $100 deposits (2.9 times net deposits, or total of 110k). \n* If I decrease to $10 deposits, my expected outcome is now 3.8 times my net deposits (but only $27k). \n* If I instead *increase* to $1000 deposits, it's only 2.6 times my net deposits (but $935k!).\n\nSo, all that to say that your recurring deposits (especially if you have very little invested compared to your anticipated future deposits) will play a drastic role in the outcome. That said, I can't imagine this is your issue, as I wasn't able to reproduce getting only 2 times more than net deposits (even a 4k monthly kept me around 2.5 times), so I'm still not sure what the issue is unless you are looking at the poor outcome/90% chance figure.\n\n**EDIT:** actually, no, the percent thing is a large part of it, read your initial post again and saw that you are looking at the 75% case scenario. Understand that this number is giving you what happens if the market significantly underperforms for years. So yes, it could be that bad, but it's not likely to be. Essentially, in 75 of 100 scenarios you have *at least* that much more money - but in many of those scenarios, it's *more*. \n\nPay more attention to the expected scenario, and recognize that Betterment is a little conservative so most others would put the expectated outcome even a little higher. And also, this is an anticipated trajectory based on market trends and history, not a crystal ball. A quick search also shows that their retirement predictions are post inflation (2% for their number).\n\nAlso, check out the end of section 2.D on this page: https://www.betterment.com/legal/retirement-planning-advice which includes *\"Because we aren\u2019t sure in which accounts you will use to save going forward, we conservatively assume all withdrawals from those savings are taxed at your average tax rate\u00a0during retirement.* _**This assumption is likely to overstate your tax rate (make your tax higher than it is) in certain situations, such as the case of all savings being in a Roth IRA**_ *(which is not taxed on withdrawal). But given the choice, we have decided to be conservative in this projection.\"* It is worth reading the whole page, but that section is particularly pertinent to your question here.\n\nSo yes, between Betterment erring on the side of caution and you choosing to look at a figure that represents pretty bad outcomes, it's a pretty low number.

(American English speaker) It's definitely painful for both of us when it happens, especially since they usually understand me just fine. Sometimes having them repeat, possibly with gestures, helps - other times I just have to apologize and pull in someone to \"translate\" between us. I at least have the excuse of being mildly hard of hearing so can blame it on that in the moment, but I think what someone else said sounds right - it's not just about the hearing, it's about the processing. And it's certainly not me trying to be rude, it's genuine.\n\nIf I spend more time with a person, I have almost always been able to get used to speech patterns and develop and understanding of what they say - but I definitely have a couple friends that I still have to really focus in on when their accent gets stronger. \n\nSo, improving your accent is a continous and worthy goal, always, but I'd give people the benefit of the doubt if they can't understand you (at least until it's clear that they really are being rude, some of them!). A strategy or two: I've noticed that when I have to ask someone to repeat themselves, it can be for words that I'm not expecting them to say, so they just repeat those words in isolation and I (surprise) still don't understand those words. In those contexts, it's more helpful for them to rephrase what they've said, especially if they can add in more context. (Eg, if I don't understand \"I bought a horse\", it's the difference between them just repeating \"Horse! Horse?!\" vs \"Yes, I bought a horse - I went to a farm and bought a horse, you know, animal with four legs that a person can ride?\")\n\nIn the case of the party introduction, it can be helpful to repeat their words back to them with some gestures to help them hear your accent a bit longer with familiar words. Eg, gesturing at them \"You asked me, 'Where are you from?'\" Then gesture at yourself, \"Me, my response is 'I am from the United States, near New York City.'\" The \"you\" plus gesture helps them (maybe) pick up on you repeating their question, and likewise with \"me/moi\" + gestures for the response.

I got really good at being able to read a transliteration and write it out in the script  - but only actually knew minimal words like mango=\u0986\u09ae. I also never actually used the audio files, so that might have helped... did feel really hard to pick up as a beginner trying to use the language.\n\n**Colloquial Bengali by Mithun B. Nasrin and W.A.M. van der Wurff 978-1-138-95007-8** - Didn't get very far, but seems like a much better resource for learning to speak, pronunciatio. Seems to follow a fairly logical pattern of introducing topics/conversations compared to Radice's less focused on the script. I would probably go back to this one first.\n\n**Lonely Planet Phrasebook Hindi, Urdu & Bengali 1-74059-149-6** - Definitely don't use as your sole resource, and get your pronunciation sorted elsewhere (their guide is insufficient), but could be a good resource for quickly learning some stock phrases.\n\n**Hippocrene Practical Dictionary Bengali** Hanne-Ruth Thompson 978-0-7818-1270-2** - While def not a standalone, in my research for Bengali resources, this seemed to be one of the better Bengali resources. Author has more experience with Bangladesh, but notes in the intro that she's noted the variations between Bangladesh/West Bengal. Is also author of a couple of her own resources.\n\n**Mango Languages** - Do you have access to this? I do, free through my library, and it has been a very useful tool for running through vocabulary/ phrases, and I found myself picking up on some grammatical structures while using it. It won't get you far, but it was a good practice for listening/ speaking, which I shy from.\n\nAs someone who has tried the above starting with Radice, I'd recommend starting with Mango and Colloquial - it gets you listening to a couple different voices, Mango is an easy \"I have a moment\" option while Colloquial is great for a bit more intense study, and Colloquial will teach you enough about the writing system (and how it corresponds to sound) to get by (Mango doesn't). Throw phrasebook in as a supplement if desired, not necessary.\n\nI struggled trying to use both Colloquial and Radice's Complete at the same time because their transliteration systems are **so** different. So, starting with the options that get you really speaking, so you can then sprinkle it into convos with your partner and/or benefit from online tutoring. However, if you want to really start diving deeper into the language and being able to write it well, then pick up Radice's and the dictionary. The dictionary uses the same transliteration as Radice, explicitly giving him credit for creating it.\n\nAt any phase, if you are writing in the script but don't have Radice's book, look up Bengali script worksheets to learn how to write the characters correctly - it really helps! If you've got Radice's book, there's an excellent two-page spread in the Introduction, which is what I used.

Her knowledge of the chemistry of baking, the accessibility of her recipes, and the incomparable taste of her creations make this book invaluable for home cooks and professional bakers alike.*\n\n*\"Understanding\" and \"Pointers for Success\" sections explain in simple, readable language the importance of various techniques and ingredients demonstrated in a recipe, providing a complete education in the art of baking, with thorough sections on types of flour, equipment, and other essentials. Easy-to-use ingredient tables provide both volume and weight, for surefire recipes that work perfectly every time.* (Source: https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Bread_Bible.html?id=pY8XAAAAQBAJ )\n\n**Dessert** covers a much broader range of baking (and some non-baking as well), but is another book full of techniques, tips, and context.

Nothing better...\n\nFor an honorable mention, look into **Cheryl Day's Treasury of Southern Baking** by, well, Cheryl Day!

She owns a bakery, and puts an exhausting amount of work into developing this book.

They haven't moved yet, they've exchanged legal status from owners to tenants (which improves their debt to equity ratio). There will most likely be a limited time period in which they can continue to rent, eg 60 or 90 days.\n* Step three: now that their debt to equity ratio is improved, they buy a new house.\n* Step four: they move into the new house. \n\nThis does involve selling the house while your father is living there, and they run the risk of not buying the new house before the rent-back agreement expires (causing them to need emergency/transitional housing). However, if it works out well and fast enough, it removes their mortgage from the equation, lowering debt while increasing assets, and means that they only need to move once (instead of moving into a rental for a short period of time in between houses).\n\nI have no experience with this, so can't provide advice on it, but wanted to clear up the misunderstanding!

So, the following is a brief approximation of what I do:\n\nI'll build my own directly in my tracker using a future day- eg, I figure I want eggs and oatmeal for breakfast; beef and barley soup for lunch; chicken, broccoli, and rice for dinner; so I put those in and see where I'm at for a day's macros and calories. Maybe I'm short on protein for the day, so I'll add in some whey to my oatmeal and/or increase the portion of chicken at dinner. Maybe I'm low on micronutrients, so I'll stir some spinach or kale into my soup. Maybe I'm high on fat, so I'll cut back on the oil I use to prepare my soup. Maybe I'm pretty balanced but low on calories, so I'll add in a snack of Greek yogurt with blueberries and almonds, proportions adjusted to match my macros.\n\nThis way, once you've got a plan that fits your full day, prep the food for the full week based on repeating that plan each day. You can also do this on a smaller scale by figuring out individual meals that each have the right macro balance, which you can then swap out from day to day without worrying about balancing macros, only calories. (Eg, oatmeal with banana/peanut butter plus chicken sausage would be a breakfast that fits my macro ratio.)\n\nThis process is essentially what I do - I pick recipes I want to make with a thought towards my macros, build them out in my tracker (either before or while preparing them), and usually have a few extra items on hand to flesh out macros/calories as needed (fruit, Greek yogurt, whey powder, canned sardines, tuna pouches, previously made and frozen dishes, etc).

Since we don't know - can't know - what you are spending the rest on, these are my four suggestions (I recommend trying all of them together)\n\n**Suggestion 1**: Consider signing up for YNAB - it has a small monthly cost, but has helped a lot of people in your shoes set up a monthly budget that really works for them. Does have a slight learning curve, I hear (haven't used it myself).\n\n**Suggestion 2**: While you're learning the YNAB setup, set yourself up on Mint by Intuit. It's free and pretty easy to set up, although you'll need to use a browser login for some stuff. For day to day use, use the app. When you set it up, it will pull in your last month or so of transactions - go through the list, and change the category on anything that is miscategorized (eg it lists CVS as a medical purchase but you know that you just bough candy bars - recategorize as \"food\" or \"groceries\"). Once that's done, look at the breakdown of categories/expenses - what surprises you? Continue to check this regularly for the next couple months, to keep away of your transactions and how they affect your cashflow. Put a widget from Mint on your main homescreen so you remember and check in.\n\n**Suggestion 3**: Stop being surprised by your credit card bill. Login and pay off the balance weekly so that the money is coming out to your account closer to when you spend it, instead of 1-2 months later when paying the statement. This doesn't need to be a long term strategy, just long enough for you to get a handle on how much you are actually spending.\n\n**Suggestion 4**: Set up a *separate* savings account, preferably an HYSA (high yield savings account), that is not part of your main bank. Ally is popular, other options exist. Either talk to HR to have $x deposited directly to that account, or set up a transfer from your checking for immediately after payroll hits. I'd suggest $1000 a month (eg $500 per check if paid twice a month), since that still leaves you with $625 spending money, but you may want to start with $400 just to be safe and ramp up. If it's out of your checking, you can't spend it - if it's out of your main bank, you won't see it/be reminded that it's available. I could never figure out where my money was going either until I started automated savings.\n\n>after covid I just lost it. I stopped budgeting during that time since I wasn\u2019t doing anything.\n\nIn addition, it sounds like spending has become a coping mechanism or emotional outlet. As you review your past transactions, and then as you initiate future ones, also ask yourself why you are spending this money. Boredom, pain, fomo, etc? In 5 days, will you remember you spent this money and still think it was a good purchase? Different strategies for this might include a financial journal, wrapping a post-it note around your credit card with a reminder, etc.\n\nThe goal of this isn't to eliminate *fun* spending, but rather *mindless* spending.

With volunteering (especially one-offs) it can be so easy to just end up with busy work that makes the volunteers feel good - this is improved if volunteers are able to make a steady, reliable commitment. But with money, it could always go towards something that filled a real need. I had a friend who worked at the food bank, and it was one if the few places I saw that managed one-off groups of volunteers effectively since they had so many of them, they kept a schedule. But I also learned that a donation of money made a *much* bigger impact than a physical food donation, as they could buy so much more with the money than regular people can at the store, and it also enabled them to buy rarer items like produce and healthy perishables. I support our local diaper bank, because receiving those at my old job reduced budgetary pressure on my clients, when they were sometimes picking between diapers, food, and bus fare.\n\nSo, definitely colored by my experience/values, but I'm planning to work my way up to 10% donations as my income increases, and reassess from there.

As a retirement account, it is *tax advantaged* - because it is a **Roth** retiremnt account, this means the government will let you put money in that you've already paid income tax on - when you remove it in the future, you will not pay taxes on it again.

Tell it you want to set up a Retirement account, specifically a Roth IRA, then accept it's recommendations for portfolio, risk tolerance/stock allotment, etc. Set-up an auto-deposit to take out $10 every time you get paid (or more, if you can),then come back here and keep learning.\n\nReassess every month - can you increase your autodeposit?

(Also, seriously, search the sub. There's lots of great advice already out there on this specific question.)\n\n------------\n\n\nFor vocab from books, I'm usually pulling the sentence directly from the book - occasionally with a modification, or using an alternative sentence so it makes sense out of context. I like doing this because then I'm focusing on what this word means in this specific sentence - useful for distinguishing when words have multiple meanings. For example, I have the phrase *\"...puisque c'est au moment o\u00f9 elle entreprenait des calculs savants pour conna\u00eetre son \u00e2ge avec pr\u00e9cision...\"* which is a direct extract from *La Qu\u00eate d'Ewilan* by Pierre Bottero. There were actually three words in this phrase where I had varying degrees of comfort, so I set up my 3 cards (basic, *not* reversed) like this:\n\n* \"...puisque c'est au moment o\u00f9 elle **entreprenait** des calculs savants pour...\"\n* entreprendre - (v) to begin, to undertake\n\n* \"...elle entreprenait des **calculs** savants pour conna\u00eetre son \u00e2ge avec pr\u00e9cision..\"\n* calcul - (n.m.) calculation\n\n* \"...elle entreprenait des calculs **savants** pour conna\u00eetre son \u00e2ge avec pr\u00e9cision..\"\n* savant - (adj) clever, shrewd\n\nSo with this, I have enough sentence to understand it, with the word that I'm trying to test my comprehension of bolded, then the word on the backside (in root form, if it's a verb) with the translation/meaning). May eventually start putting the definition in French instead of English, but this got me started. This has been helpful for building in longer phrases or idioms, where I can see it in context, give the direct translation, but provide a more contextual understanding as well:\n\n* Camille commen\u00e7a \u00e0 penser que quelque chose **ne tournait pas rond**.\n* ne pas tourner rond - to not run smoothly *(...that something wasn't right)*\n\n* Camille **inspira** un grand coup.\n* inspirer - (v) to inhale, breathe *(Camille took a deep breath.)*\n\nI don't do reverse cards because 1. It might be unclear *which* word I'm looking for if I just write *to inhale, breathe* and 2. I value having the extra information. I believe you can set up more advanced card types with notes fields that will then only ever show on the backside of your card, but again, I'm doing this all on mobile, so trying to keep it simple. \n\nCan you do cards that are simple word/translation like *inspirer/to inhale*? Sure - it will be easier with some words than others, but there are definitely plenty of nouns/adjectives/etc where the simplest card form is sufficient - and then doing a reversed card becomes easier as well. It gets tricky when words have multiple meanings in different contexts - that's where you may more strongly value a sentence-based card. \n\nI'd worry less about creating cards for all the regular verb forms - if I see and recognize another form of *entreprendre*, my understanding of its definitions will carry over from learning it as *entreprenait*. Creating multiple cards may come in more use for irregular forms, where I might otherwise produce the wrong form and/or not recognize it in the text. For example, I have: \n\n* Elle **fut** tir\u00e9e de sa r\u00eaverie...\n* fut = \u00eatre (pass\u00e9 simple pour il/elle)\n\nI don't need to define \u00eatre, I'm way past that, but I did need to learn to recognize this form of it when seen.\n\nHope these ideas help!", "created_utc": "1620181399.0", "edited": "False", "id": "gwzamwg", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_n534cx", "parent_id": "t3_n534cx", "score": "6", "subreddit": "Anki", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s9lm"}, {"author": "marjoramandmint", "body": "I'm pretty sure my Kindle hasn't been connected to wifi/updated for about 4 or 5 years now.

There was an interpreter hired for all-staff meetings, and lots of communication via emails and writing back and forth. I was on the outside looking in inconsistently, so it's possible that introversion had as much to do with it, but they seemed rather separate from the rest of their team.\n\nMy primary experience was with church, where for several years we had an interpreter and several Deaf families, but it often felt like a Venn diagram of two communities in one space. Those who were hearing talked to each other, those who signed talked to each other l, and we had a few HoH people who did both and could cross the divide. However, hearing people never learned enough sign to communicate with the fully Deaf individuals, so there was a lack of meaningful integration between the two groups.\n\nAll this to say: I would err on the side of learning - not as an \"accommodation\" because with 1 hour a week, you won't learn enough for that, but in interest of being able to have a one-on-one conversation of daily pleasantries without the need of an interpreter. I suspect it will be appreciated, especially if you are genuinely using it for regular conversation and not just to make a splash during the \"Welcome to the team\" meeting. However, if it turns out that this intern feels much as your colleague's brother does, it's easy to cease using it with them moving forward (while enjoying - and perhaps even pursuing - your newfound skill).\n\nI will also note that text to speech in Zoom is... not always great.

I haven't used either of them yet (recently bought the books + need new equipment), but have read them both thoroughly. Below I've spent too much time typing up info on each of them.\n\n**The Dehydrator Cookbook for Outdoor Adventurers** by Julie Mosier\n\n* Part 1 - Basics of dehydrating for the outdoors -, useful information for someone taking this on the trail - but pretty short. Also info on picking a dehydrator.\n* Part 2 - Dehydrating food at home - this covers all of the basic 1-ingredient or simple recipes\n* Part 3 - recipes for meals/snacks/desserts\n\nI'd recommend this for someone who is specifically interested in trail food, especially if they are new to dehydrating. I'm not blown away by the recipe selection, but then again, as someone with ~200 cookbooks, I may not be the typical consumer in this regard. You'll find things like beef or salmon jerky, carrot-pineapple oatmeal, lemony lentil salad, porter-infused chili w/ bacon, pasta with sausage and peppers, spinach artichoke dip, and berry crisp. She explains how to pack things for backpacking, when to cold-soak, and tips like not making the tuna salad wraps if you're in bear country. So, definitely a good option for the outdoors person.\n\n**Complete Dehydrator Cookbook** by Carole Cancler\n\n* an extensive dehydrating 101 section, include advice on safety, pre-treatments, safe storage, and rehydration \n* a comprehensive (~45 pages) section on dehydrating produce, including pages of detailed notes for different fruits/veggies, a troubleshooting table, a 2-page spread on making produce powders, and another 3 pages on seasonings.\n* 25 meat and fish jerky recipes, including classic beef, pastrami beef, african-style, nepalese-styke, bourbon-glazed venison/elk, sesame-glazed char siu-style pork, carribean-style goat, native American pemmican.\n* 9 leathers (banana-orange, tropical, berry, coconut-curry, savory tomato) and 11 chips (apple, roasted pineapple, herbed carrot, parmesan tomato, lemon-pepper parsnip)\n* a \"just add water\" section with 18 meals (ground beef chili, ropa vieja stew, indian lentils with lamb, risotto w/ pancetta peas & mushrooms, weamst african peanut stew, Hawaiian shrimp curry) plus basics carb options (rice, quinoa, grits, rice pilaf) and a shredded vegetable salad (cold soak, and it's a slaw!), as well as 7 pages of template recipes where you can pick from a whole list of ingredients for a nearly infinite possibilities \n* a snack/dessert section of 28 recipes, including spicy curry cashews, falafel bites, avocado flaxseed crackers, carrot walnut crackers, double chocolate biscotti, lemon-cashew coconut macaroons, chocolate chip cookies\n\nIn case you couldn't already tell, this is the book that fascinates me, with both classic \"Western\" recipes but also international-style flavors, some interesting combinations, and the sheer number of recipes is much larger than the other book. This book gets me excited to use a dehydrator again with all of the unique (for a dehydrator) recipes, instead of just making the same boring (but tasty) apple chips.

Should I always write an unknown word on the copybook or I should only write most popular ones? It's really annoying and frustrating to stop reading every 10/15 seconds to write down an unknown word...**\n\nSuggested strategy: \n\n1. If not knowing the word doesn't impede (prevent) your understanding of the sentence, just skip it for now. \n2. If you don't understand the sentence because of a hard word, but it's not crucial (important) to understanding the greater plot or story, skip it. \n3. If you can't understand what is happening in the full story because you don't understand that word, look it up. \n4. If you see the same word many times in the story, look it up so you can build your contextual understanding when you see it in a future sentence.\n\nIn addition to the above, I'm reading my second language (French) books in paperback, so I keep a pencil with it and underline all the words I don't understand. I only look up words that fit #3 or #4 above. I have a long term goal of going back, making flashcards of all the words, including cloze cards with sentences straight from my book, but even if I never follow through on that admittedly tedious task, I've gotten through the book.\n\nIf reading an ebook, still follow the above strategy, but make sure you have your second language's dictionary on your ebook reader (can you highlight the words a certain color?) - should then be able to long-press the word to get the definition/translation.\n\n**OP response: Your method is pretty interesting, I'll check it out. Should I even add these words to a flashcard program later?**\n\nShould you? It depends - do you want to learn and be able to recall the word? Is it one that you are coming across a lot? Is it one that you anticipate finding in future texts? How much time do you have to devote to creating flashcards? If you don't have a lot of flashcard-creation time, then you'll want to be more strategic about which words you make cards for - if you have a lot of time, then you can invest more of your time in flashcard creation (but also, could still be more strategic, and use the surplus time to just practice reading more, using context clues when possible).\n\nRight now, I'm interested in learning all sorts of vocab, but I have no time to invest in flashcard creation. Thus, I cut that part of learning out for now, but can always go back and add it in when I have more time.\n\nI used to write out vocab in a separate notebook, then look up and write down translations, but even that was taking too much time. I needed to be able to just read, and read more, so that's when I switched to underlining and only looking up words strategically. I don't have time to develop my own flashcards, but I do use lists that others have prioritized via Lingvist and Decks by Memrise.\n\n**Modern update: I'll note that at this point I have started to create flashcards in Anki for unknown words due to more free time than before - it's still early days, but it feels like a good use of my time, and I'm looking forward to rereading the book with all the vocabulary learned!**", "created_utc": "1619018282.0", "edited": "False", "id": "gvbyoqs", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_mvfeue", "parent_id": "t3_mvfeue", "score": "1", "subreddit": "books", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh4i"}, {"author": "marjoramandmint", "body": "\nCongrats on graduating!\n\n* One thing I don't see mentioned is how much your monthly minimum budget is, and therefore how much of that $2400/month you can save each month to help cover costs - that would affect my pay cash vs consider a loan reasoning.

I feel like outright saying no will only make it worse.\n\n...is that you don't need to say \"no\", but you do need to be able to say \"not now\" if it doesn't align with your budget. That \"pay yourself first\" concept can **also** apply to your gear/hobby fund. After you figure out how much needs to go to your various savings buckets, figure out how much is usually left from each paycheck that you'd be happy to spend on your hobby (eg $50) without risk of cutting into necessary expenses. Then, also automatic transfer that amount to a savings account directly for that. (Some banks/services provide options to create buckets, I think Ally is one, Betterment has just started doing this). If you end up at the end of the month with extra unspent money, you might use it for savings, a nice dinner, or top off your hobby fund, but this way you are investing some money into your hobby each month, just as much as you are your savings/retirement.\n\nThen something comes up, and you want to spend $300 and buy some sweet new gear. \n\n* **Scenario A:** You've got $400 in your hobby bucket - 2.5 months saving, plus a top off of unspent money in month 2 (after carefully making sure that money wasn't needed elsewhere). Sweet! Buy the gear!\n* **Scenario B:** You've got $200 in the hobby bucket. Not enough! But that's cool - you tell yourself **\"not yet\"** and wait another month. It's fine, the gear's going to last you a few years anyway - and when you finally buy it, the anticipation makes it that much sweeter!\n* **Scenario C:** You've got $200 in the hobby bucket. Not enough! But that's cool - you tell yourself **\"not yet\"** and wait another month. By the time that month passes, though, the pressure is off and you realize that gear was overhyped, and you'd rather spend on something else instead.\n\nI bring up Scenario C specifically because that made the biggest change in my life. Without using buckets or reserved spending, I switched to setting up a cart online or otherwise noting what I wanted to buy, then sitting on it for a couple weeks before making the purchase. This cut out a lot of impulse, \"It sounds like a good idea\" purchases, which I often appreciated for a bit before swiftly forgetting. But if I still want those items in a couple weeks and I've got the spare cash, I get them! I do this especially for my hobby, and it's helped me value the items I decide to get all the more since they are no longer crowded out by others. \n\nUltimately, however, this strategy can help you pace your spending, especially when \"no\" can feel like a deprivation.

I started with 10k to keep it simple, figured out your 1% interest for the CD, then did 7% for the stock market (which is apparently the average return, adjusted for inflation - I *think* comparing it to the CD, it would be more accurate to use the 10% actual return number, but am not *positive*, so sticking with the more conservative number.)

The highest salary in the calculator, $10 million, had a cap gains tax of 1,318 in DC - still worth the stock over the CD.\n\nOf course, all of this doesn't take your own risk comfort level into account - you may need the peace of mind from having something guaranteed, instead of the risk of a market crash, but consider if a portfolio of bonds/stocks that is heavier on bonds would help - lower anticipated returns, but also lower volatility.

There's even people roasting [whole frozen chickens](https://cookthestory.com/cook-whole-chicken-frozen/)!", "created_utc": "1618538622.0", "edited": "False", "id": "guoeznw", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_mre9m9", "parent_id": "t1_gunv3rt", "score": "1", "subreddit": "instantpot", "subreddit_id": "t5_31q4c"}, {"author": "marjoramandmint", "body": "For future reference: when looking at a recipe that calls for chicken that doesn't explicitly state frozen/thawed, you can assume that it means thawed/fresh chicken. That is the default for most recipes.\n\nWith the instant pot, you can generally get away with adding the chicken to it while still frozen if you are just putting it in (with other stuff) and setting it to pressure cook, even if the recipe doesn't specifically call for frozen. The longer time heating up will usually ensure the chicken is fully done (but I'd search other threads for verification, as I don't work with frozen chicken - there might be a rule to add a minute or two to the cook time).\n\nWhether instant pot or stovetop, a recipe that calls for browning chicken will likely always need the chicken to be thawed - preferably also having sat out for 15-20 minutes to get closer to room temperature. If you try to brown straight from frozen, you're much more likely to end up with a pale, watery mess.\n\nHowever, as someone else pointed out: you can also probably make this particular recipe without browning the chicken, and be fine with it. Browning adds flavor and color, but you may be willing to trade those in for this recipe for ease and convenience, and that would be fine too. I would personally prefer to take the extra time and effort to thaw and brown 80% of the time - but when that extra time is an impediment to actually getting food made, I'll take the shortcut and rely on the cumin/chilies/cilantro for flavor.", "created_utc": "1618505527.0", "edited": "1618506006.0", "id": "gumg5ld", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_mre9m9", "parent_id": "t3_mre9m9", "score": "74", "subreddit": "instantpot", "subreddit_id": "t5_31q4c"}, {"author": "marjoramandmint", "body": "I love the chair being in a corner like that, helps emphasize the reading **nook** feel!", "created_utc": "1618327400.0", "edited": "False", "id": "gudoi1y", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_mptgry", "parent_id": "t1_guczihf", "score": "3", "subreddit": "bookshelf", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s9t6"}, {"author": "marjoramandmint", "body": "Oooh, I wonder if this could be a good use for some old, about-to-be-trashed books to give them second life - remove the pages, prop internally with a couple tiny blocks of wood to maintain height without density, then line just inside the cover (where the edges of the book would have been) with a light, easy to clean mesh.

Probably yes. But, it would also probably be super tight. \n\n**missing info**: assume this is US - what state, since that affects state income tax rate? How much do you have to pay on your student loans each month? What would the rest of your budget look like, especially work transportation? How are you covering actual moving costs to get there, much less furnish the place? Is there a car (and related expenses) in this equation? Is there any risk that your gf doesn't move in, eg gets her own dream job elsewhere? If you spend your 2k savings on rent/security deposit/moving, how do you cover your food/transport costs until your first paycheck? Does 1k apartment rent cover utilities? Do you have family that would provide you with a loan in case of emergency?\n\nYou don't have to answer all of that here, as long as you're thinking about them. I did a quick Google search, and it took me to a page that suggested that [with Iowa state taxes](https://us.icalculator.info/salary-illustration/41000.html), 41k would have a take-home pay of $33k. I live in a HCOL city, and have rent (with roommates) of $1050/month + utilities - would be 1500-2000 for an apartment by myself. I spent a little less than 33k this past year, but I also have a paid off car with cheap insurance, no moving costs, no student loans, and a 6-month emergency fund. I also could have been *more* frugal, certainly. That also doesn't reflect my savings - with the expenses you'll face in a new place/city/job, you may find it hard to save anything on top of rent, including building your emergency fund back up.\n\nAs already mentioned, covering first month's rent + security deposit for an $1k unit is likely to wipe out your savings. Since this is another state where you (presumably) haven't lived before, I'd suggest looking for a sublet option for those first 3 months that is maybe $700. This gives you a chance to know the city before committing to an apartment, as well as confirm your gf's plans to move there too. What you save in rent during those three months can help with security deposit for the new place, and you might find a good deal on an apartment by being in the city that you wouldn't have found from afar. \n\nAlternatively, if your gf is definitely moving in with you within 3 months, and you want to go straight for the apartment, no subletting somewhere cheaper first, can she pitch in? She should definitely be paying half the security deposit - can she pay maybe 20% of the rent those months too? Not a lot, not 50/50, but in recognition of the fact that you wouldn't be renting it without the plan for her to move in soon.  Also read the early termination and lease renewal clauses carefully (well, read the whole lease carefully!).\n\ntl;dr - 1k apartment is probably feasible, but doesn't give a lot of wiggle room during those 3 months if you're paying all costs for it yourself.

If you've paid it off, you now have no loan, but only 3k for a down payment on a new one (if you need one) that knocks out the rest of your emergency fund. If another emergency happens the, you're SOL. If you didn't pay it off, you now have more flexibility on down payment while still maintaining some emergency fund, but will likely be making double car payments in the meantime. (I haven't accounted for insurance/warranty here - will depend on your policies, make sure you know.)\n\nBad scenario #2: something happens to your job. If you paid off your car, you now have 3k to tide you over in the meantime. If you didn't, you have 12k to tide you over (knowing that $250 every month is going towards the car payment). Doesn't account for possible unemployment checks - how many months could you live off 3k/12k each while you look for a new job, preferably a good one instead of a desperate choice? Especially if Uber isn't sufficient/an option?\n\nBad scenario #3: Something happens to you - medical emergency, house fire, family crisis, something where you need to spend money fast (even if you might recoup some of it later). Having 12k will make you much better positioned to deal with it than just 3k. (Especially if something happens to you + job to the point that you can't use your backup plan of Uber, especially, eg medical crisis rendering you unable to work/drive for a while.)\n\nUltimately - as you've likely guessed by now - I'd recommend continuing with the loan instead of paying the car in full. It could be a different story if you had a high interest rate, or if you had additional savings on top of a solid emergency fund. However, from your numbers elsewhere in this thread (~12k in savings and ~9k to pay on the loan) it seems that paying off your loan in full would wipe out most of your savings, which reduces the cushion/flexibility of dealing with life's nasty surprises. Since your interest rate is low, it seems wiser to maintain your cushion and pay the loan monthly.\n\nIf you hate having debt hanging over your head, consider a middle ground: paying it off monthly, but increasing your payments a little bit. Say, paying $400 a month instead of $250 (especially if you can do that entirely from your salary, without cutting into your savings). You'll have the car paid off in less than 3 years, you'll maintain your emergency fund in case of a future crisis, and you'll have the flexibility to back down to $250 a month in the future if a bad scenario really does occur. If you pay off the loan and then something bad happens but you don't have enough liquid cash to deal with it, you could risk putting yourself in a bad spot. If you don't pay off the loan upfront, you maintain much more flexibility to deal with life's surprises, and at little additional cost considering your low interest rate.", "created_utc": "1617243924.0", "edited": "False", "id": "gszj7nw", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_mhc5mw", "parent_id": "t3_mhc5mw", "score": "1", "subreddit": "personalfinance", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qstm"}, {"author": "marjoramandmint", "body": "Definitely search here and r/cookbooks for \"Made in India\", there's been a lot of great convo and recommendations regarding that book!\n\nWill be curious to hear how you like Andres's Made in Spain - I had that for a while and ultimately gave it up as I wasn't inspired by it.", "created_utc": "1617153802.0", "edited": "False", "id": "gsv8f97", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_mg2646", "parent_id": "t3_mg2646", "score": "2", "subreddit": "CookbookLovers", "subreddit_id": "t5_2fu2g6"}, {"author": "marjoramandmint", "body": "Sounds good - I'm glad you were able to have that conversation, along with the other items you mentioned in your OP edit!

Hold onto your current savings (especially since you don't mention having a separate emergency fund), but instead of adding to it, take the money you had been adding to your savings per month and add it to your credit card payment instead. That way, instead of a minimum payment on the credit card, you're paying (presumably) at least two or three times the minimum, thus knocking out the credit card debt much faster without eliminating your current savings. (If a smaller savings is fine, eg $5000 covers 6 months expenses, then can do a lump sum of another 1-2k of however much savings you have over that 5k emergency fund).\n\nIn the meantime, you still have savings, credit card debt is getting knocked at fast, and if you end up finding an awesome job that pays a lot better that you'll *need* a car for, you then still have all or some of the savings left to do a reasonable down-payment on a decent used car, presumably a slightly better credit score from the increased debt payment, and the increased revenue should be enough to cover the increased/new costs.

In addition, most newbies won't see maximum benefit from isolation exercises, and most machines remove the need to self-stabilize, which would be beneficial for most people to be doing themselves.

Starting Strength and StrongLifts are similar and get a lot of criticism for not being optimal, but do teach you the basic moves while making the plan much easier to follow (workouts A vs B) - SL even has an app to do the work for you. If you want to stick with dumbells, there is a plan for those listed on that page too.\n\nSince you've got some concerns about what you are doing, how your form looks, etc, I'd suggest picking either SS or SL simply for the simplicity of the programs. Whatever you pick, the next time you go into the gym, your focus is on just developing your form for one or two exercises. Read the description on how to do that exercise from the program (eg [SL squats](https://stronglifts.com/squat/)), maybe another trusted resource ([Nerd Fitness](https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/strength-training-101-how-to-squat-properly/), [Stronger by Science](https://www.strongerbyscience.com/how-to-squat/) before you go, then pull them up again to read through **while** you are at the gym. Read through the cues for your feet, then do a few reps with the empty bar. Read through the cues for abdominal bracing, then do another few reps. Do this for a few gym visits until you're comfortable with all the moves in a program, then start with day 1 of the program.\n\nThis was the process I went through when I first started strength training - including close to 10 minutes of hiding in the locker room on my very first solo visit, until I finally made it out on the floor for 15 minutes. I did deadlifts with a 30 lb bar because I was terrified of hurting my back with bad form - then quickly progressed as soon as the comfort level was built up. While you might not be quite as nervous as I was, the process of really learning the moves, reading through the guides, maybe watching some videos until you're comfortable will help with your form questions - then following a predetermined plan will help with the \"what do I do?\" question. The fact that you can occasionally work with a trainer will help with getting form right, too - use any sessions with them to really lock down your form (assuming they are certified), and maybe ask that during ach session with them they show you one new piece of equipment or exercise, to help broaden your knowledge base (but still stick with your beginner plan for your actual workouts, to start building your muscles/strength).", "created_utc": "1613177590.0", "edited": "False", "id": "gn4f4im", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_lijnjj", "parent_id": "t3_lijnjj", "score": "1", "subreddit": "veganfitness", "subreddit_id": "t5_2smq8"}, {"author": "marjoramandmint", "body": "It depends on what you want - many protein-concerned vegans seem to prefer Cronometer over MFP due to the breakdown of amino acids and micronutrients.

It helps that I don't have any history of ED, nor do I have the emotional response to my tracking data that many others in this community do. For me, it's a useful tool in a way that intuitive eating probably never would be (and yet, there are many people that find the opposite).\n\n* Counting calories helped me to eat more consistently - I might eat a late snack when I realize I'm 700 below maintenance for the day, or I might slow down when I realize that fun eating is about to take me 1000 over maintenance. While I still have the *occasional* over/under, eating more consistently usually feels better the next day, and has made a huge difference in regularly having good workouts.\n* Calorie counting has helped me prioritize more nutrient dense food, and slow down on in-the-moment consumption. If I'm reaching for a third serving of peanut M&Ms, maybe I should consider if I've eaten an actual meal recently (usually no), focus on getting more protein and micronutrients first.\n* Calorie counting has been even more important when I've cut/bulked - I like to do both gently (eg 200-250 +/- from maintenance), and tracking helps me keep on track with my goal without the swings I'd experience when I tried to do so \"intuitively\".\n* Food tracking has helped me keep my protein levels up - I can easily run 25-30g protein in a day if I'm not paying attention, especially if I'm eating vegetarian. If I'm not working out, that's still low enough that I don't feel great, but if I'm powerlifting it's *definitely* not enough! Protein intake is my main focus with food tracking, and definitely affects my lifts.\n* Food tracking has helped me be more intentional about my carb intake, making sure that I get some carbs both pre- and post-workout, fuel my workouts and recovery.\n* Food tracking has helped me realize that eating a little more food/calories the week before my period can help mitigate (albeit not prevent) the weakness/fatigue that I'll feel in my workouts at that time - and since, helps me make sure that I'm getting that extra food in.\n* As someone with often low iron (but not anemic) and with a likely future in diabetes, food tracking helps me keep an eye on those measures, and be more deliberate in affecting those numbers as desired - especially in avoiding fatigue from low iron.\n* As someone who likes to cook a lot of high-oil/high-fat recipes, food tracking helps me keep my fat intake in proportion with my other macros so I still get enough protein/carbs (got up to ~75% fat the week I did a ton of coconut milk recipes - oops!)\n* Sometimes I track with a specific goal (usually maintenance) and it affects my food choices, sometimes I track just to keep an eye on what I am eating without trying to actually change anything, and sometimes I quit for a couple days/weeks if it's just not working for my life at the moment (hello, pandemic wall). I don't feel guilty about the breaks, especially since I'll pick it back up when I have the bandwidth to spare again.\n* Unintended benefit: food tracking (especially since I log so many recipes, including recipe date/name/source) has turned into a great way of remembering dishes I've made previously! (\"What was that lamb dish I made several months ago? Oh right, *20.09.14 Cinnamon lamb curry (Made in India pg 108)*\" )\n\nOf course, if calorie counting has a negative effect on your physical/mental health, **don't do it**.

(Can learn strategies to mitigate this.)\n* Cronometer has a much smaller database, but entries are much more reliable and have more nutrition data in them.\n* MFP has all sorts of foods from all sorts of cultures in it - is rare that I can't find something in it. Cronometer was much more Western/American culture in their database, couldn't find some ingredients in it.\n* *Subjective:* While searching \"Buffalo chicken cheesesteak\" gets a wide range of options in MFP and has little/dubious precision, sometimes being able to get \"close enough\" meant the difference between tracking or giving up.\n* MFP (free) can let you set your calorie goal, decide your macro split, then show your total/goal for macros plus select others (eg sodium, sugar, calcium, potassium, Vitamins A and C).\n* Cronometer has a much more extensive nutrient profile for most of their whole foods, including more vitamins and the amino acids for proteins. Probably more valuable if you eat more whole foods vs packaged/processed items, or if you're vegetarian/vegan/otherwise watching your amino acids for balance.\n* *Subjective:* I strongly preferred the MFP recipe function over the Cronometer one. Is easier to add in the necessary ingredients, whereas Cronomenter didn't even have all of my ingredients. MFP recipe workflow was simpler with better UX.\n* *Subjective:* In Cronometer, there was something where on one chart it listed a lower calorie number (think it was my BMR?) Even though my daily goal was set higher. I hated looking at it and seeing my calories go over that number *every* single day before even dinner, even though I intellectually knew that the chart had a low calorie count on it (my actual calorie goal was correct elsewhere). Could never figure out how to fix that - MFP lets me change my calorie goal (and only has that one calorie number) and turn off adding exercise, so I'm now over/under my true goal in a more expected pattern.\n\nIf I were eating a simpler (less recipes), purely Western-ingredients-based diet, and needed the more detailed nutrient information, then I'd totally use Cronometer as my first choice. I also have happily recommended it to other people.
