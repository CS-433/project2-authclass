Many of us were raised by a single grandmother because half the men in our families were caught by drug addiction or an extremely predatory prison cycle (think years in prison for selling marijuana as a black or brown man in the 90s compared to the legality of it in several states now).

Yes, of course! [This](https://www.reddit.com/r/GetMotivated/comments/5950tm/text_i_just_finished_the_online_coursera_course/) post is a summary of the Coursera course of the same name. Here's my own gist:\n\n1. Deep focus is key. I use an app called Forest combined with the Pomodoro technique. I do 25 minutes of study, 5 minute break, then repeat. I do this 4 times before taking a longer 15-60 minute break, then repeat another 4 Pomodoros. Make sure your study area is distraction free. No checking phone / apps etc.\n2. Active recall / retrieval practice is king. Read something and then test yourself on it: ask yourself: what did I just read? If you can't recall, reread it then re-test yourself. If you're doing math, try to work the problem sets out yourself, only looking at the solution once you're finished with your attempt. \n3. [Spacing your study.](https://www.kpu.ca/sites/default/files/Learning%20Centres/Think_SpacedRepetition_LA.pdf)Don't cram every thing at once. Do a little bit each day. Better to study 1 hour each day for 3 days than 3 hours in 1 day. This results in a significant increase in long term retention of material. Use a program like Anki which utilizes spaced repetition system, or simply look up popular SRS timeframes and review your notes accordingly.\n4. Interleaving techniques (doing mixed problem sets instead of just chunks of the same kinds of problems, for example). This helps a lot in quickly intuiting / identifying what sort of problem you are dealing with / what it is asking you.\n5. Use memory tricks like acronyms, vivid imagery, and mnemonics to help rote memorization of facts (anatomy, new language vocab, etc).\n6. SLEEP! And EXERCISE! This should actually be #1. Your brain strengthens new neural connections during REM sleep (which is correlated with overall length of sleep ie longer duration of sleep = more REM). It also PRUNES / weakens unused neurons during this time. The same synapses that activate in the brain while learning something new during the day activate while you are asleep, suggesting the brain is consolidating these new skills during sleep. Exercise assists in nerve cell's dendritic growth -- this makes it easier for neurons to connect and strengthen one another. Basically makes it easier for you to learn new things. So, long term learning quite literally occurs while you are sleeping, not just when you are studying.j", "created_utc": "1660770445.0", "edited": "1660783574.0", "id": "ikpjx8k", "is_submitter": "True", "link_id": "t3_wqwu2f", "parent_id": "t1_ikp2t4d", "score": "7", "subreddit": "GetStudying", "subreddit_id": "t5_2tl44"}, {"author": "arrozcongandul", "body": "thanks so much, I really appreciate your comment!!

I was in a similar position you \u2014 I\u2019m American but I have family from latin america, so Spanish was always around growing up but I never took it upon myself to learn it well enough to speak. I\u2019ve been studying now for about a year and a half and have made extremely good progress (I\u2019m conversationally fluent, journal in spanish, text / call my friends and family in spanish, read very long novels written for adults, etc). I personally didn\u2019t use duolingo. I did however download an app called WordReference which has an english to spanish & spanish to english dictionary. I used that any time I wasn\u2019t sure how to say something or whenever I encountered an unfamiliar word. There\u2019s even audio files of how to pronounce words in a general Spaniard accent, Mexican accent, and Argentinian accent. It also has conjugation tables for verbs \u2014 extremely useful!!\n\nI also use a spaced repetition system (SRS) program called Anki to learn vocabulary. SRS essentially takes care of spacing out your reviews so you see words you struggle to remember more often, and words that are easy, less often. That way you aren\u2019t reviewing a million words every day wasting time. I started with a premade deck of the 5,000 more frequent words, [here](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1350487717)\n\nI would say study 10-20 new words a day (+ reviews) depending on how much time you have to study. The reviews add up pretty quickly, so start slow. I use [these settings](https://youtu.be/Eo1HbXEiJxo) to optimize Anki\u2019s algorithm for language learning. \n\nApart from Anki and WordReference, I also prefer to use Deepl over google translate. Deepl gives a variety of possible translations, and usually is better with colloquialisms / sayings. On top of all of this, reading, listening to podcasts whenever doing busy work around the house / driving, and watching shows in Spanish have all been super helpful. But probably the most helpful has been talking with native speakers using language exchange apps like Tandem & Hellotalk. You help them with English and they help you with Spanish. This is great because you get to see how the language is actually used in real life. If you have any more questions, just send me a message.

In addition, I bought a simple workbook + a much more in depth, large grammar reference textbook. I worked through the workbook over a few months and now just glance at my reference whenever I want a refresh or need to specify something. All the while, I switched my life to Spanish. All shows, podcasts, music & other media was Spanish. I got on language exchange apps to constantly text and call people in Spanish. It was basically a combination of active recall + input. I\u2019ll always lean heaviest on active recall (anki) + interactions with native speakers, though. You learn so many real usages of the language that you just cannot get otherwise. Textbooks are great starting points, though.\n\nedit*\nThis post is what I did to reach fluency in Spanish. I\u2019m still working on my portuguese, but following the same path with extremely strong results. Obviously the Spanish foundation helps, but I\u2019m holding extended conversations with Brazilians & generally able to understand every day media, music etc after something like 6 weeks of intense study. Intense meaning 2~ hours of active daily study and another 3~ of input + interaction.", "created_utc": "1659690192.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ij151dq", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_wgp4uz", "parent_id": "t3_wgp4uz", "score": "22", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "arrozcongandul", "body": "you touched upon it with your post: the grind. after getting through one language and started with another, you know what it takes. and for as much as you want to firehose blast your brain with the language, there\u2019s just literally so much you can do. Portuguese feels so similar to spanish to me that it\u2019s almost frustrating not just being fluent with the snap of my fingers. I\u2019m piling on the Anki study and spending hours talking with Brazilians and watching content but I feel like mentally I\u2019m ahead of where my brain actually is. A lot of times I can intuit my way through things thanks to Spanish. And a lot of times I can comprehend a lot of the native material I\u2019m watching. Reading has been the easiest by far since day one. But occasionally I\u2019ll run into someone with an unfamiliar accent, or I just can\u2019t catch what they\u2019re saying, and it\u2019s like I\u2019m brought back to the reality of just being a learner.

Every time you recall something, you're strengthening the specific neural pathways related to it, and when you learn new related information, that's expanding the dendritic system which is like a web of chains. IE you learn an infinitive form of a verb, then you see it conjugated in a future tense, then you see it used as an adjective, etc. The more this additional information is compounded, the stronger the web gets. That's why it's so crucial to use active recall and interleaving within language learning. Anki and spontaneous conversations with natives over a wide range of topics can do wonders for forcing your memory to work to strengthen those neural connections. \n\nI find this very applicable to learning portuguese. So much looked so familiar that once past the phonological differences, it simply felt like tacking on to my Spanish. Almost reinforcing the portuguese that much faster because I had direct connections to make with another language I already speak fluently.", "created_utc": "1659664057.0", "edited": "False", "id": "iizyr5o", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_wg9y2w", "parent_id": "t1_iizj7b7", "score": "3", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "arrozcongandul", "body": "\"And english everywhere else\" isn't entirely true.
