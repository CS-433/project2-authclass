Can you see where I\u2019m coming from? While one\u2019s ability to recognize patterns can be sharp in chess, it shouldn\u2019t mean they are sharp in day to day life. \n\nAs for memory, I still fail to see how the ability to memorize hundreds of chess patterns can correspond to my ability to memorize my maths formulae, science facts, historical dates, etc for school. Memory is a very complex topic in general, but it is my firm belief that information is stored and encoded into memory in different ways. The images of countless chess patterns can be stored in memory because they are seen and needed often when playing chess, but that won\u2019t really help me memorize my schoolwork any better, you see what I mean?", "created_utc": "1590108354.0", "edited": "False", "id": "freg607", "is_submitter": "True", "link_id": "t3_go8hyd", "parent_id": "t1_frecw2o", "score": "1", "subreddit": "changemyview", "subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8"}, {"author": "DragonTamer69420", "body": "Don\u2019t forget The Sentence is Death, man that twist had me in a seizure", "created_utc": "1590026540.0", "edited": "False", "id": "frauiqu", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_gn8i6m", "parent_id": "t1_fr88lif", "score": "1", "subreddit": "booksuggestions", "subreddit_id": "t5_2ryqe"}, {"author": "DragonTamer69420", "body": "Honestly, if you go onto Youtube and search \u2018best anime ops\u2019 you\u2019ll get a ton.
