This means they need to be the subject of multiple independent articles, that aren't just routine event articles.\n\nThere are certainly lots of fighters that fit this criteria that still don't have pages, and I've been working on remedying that, but in the end not every pro-fighter is notable enough. Even if they're up and coming (actually, especially if they're up and coming; once they're a big deal, then they're fit for a wiki page).\n\nAlso, in case you are wondering, top-tier organizations are currently counted as the UFC and Invicta.

I wasn't the greatest at studying throughout the year but I could pull off a good cram the week before finals so that was my specialty. This lost its effectiveness over the years, and my lowest average was an 81 in 3A.\n\nThis semester (3B) I got the 91 by starting the study grind 2 weeks before my first final exam. Midterms I did not start early enough and so some courses did not get enough time. I also got terrible sleep because I'm an idiot who would stay up all night trying to stuff shit into my head. Don't do that, it is so hard to think then you are running on 1-2 hours of sleep. Finals were really the turning point for me, so no matter how midterms go always remember that there is another chance.\n\nOverall, mindset is everything. If you aren't overly stressed (usually because you're not cramming the day before an exam) you will be surprised how much knowledge you can absorb, and how well you'll be able to apply it to problems. Get proper sleep, try to study the material beforehand, go outside and see your friends. Everyone who gets admitted to UW is capable of great things, I am a firm believer of this. Also try not to get a concussion, it doesn't help.\n\nAll the best! I hope your parents end up being more understanding as time goes by.
