I think it sort of misses the point. We\u2019re usually taught that domesticated animals, well at least cows for example, are dumb automatons when that isn\u2019t the case at all. They can be quite playful, and they have social lives and emotions of their own. They might not have the complexity of our emotions, but how are we to know that for certain? I read a Jane Goodall book and was astounded at the things chimpanzees are capable of. They live out lives with dramatic arcs, seeking to become powerful leaders, or longing to find the love they never had in childhood (in the case of one female chimp). To me it doesn\u2019t matter very much whether a chimp or a cow could solve a calculus problem. After all, computers can perform way more complex operations than we can, but we don\u2019t say they have souls. I don\u2019t agree with the idea of equating academic intelligence with value; besides that, there are so many different types of intelligence like social and spatial intelligence. In the latter sense, a lion would make me look like an idiot!\n\nTo me mammals like cows and chimps do have souls. And that\u2019s what really matters. Their emotions, ability to feel pain, and have social lives. I can\u2019t quantify their value exactly in relation to the value of a human life, but the idea of farm animals being horribly mistreated in factory farms causes me a great deal of sadness. \n\nIt scares me when people say that animals are soulless; this is a modern idea that came about and was reinforced so that people would find factory farming and animal testing more palatable. It\u2019s an idea that Jane Goodall spent much of her career fighting against. Not that you have said that, but I\u2019ve encountered people who have, and it\u2019s still a prevalent belief (at least in the Western world).\n\nFinally, it\u2019s good to remember that humans are animals too. This is an odd thing, when people refer to non-human animals as just \u201canimals\u201d like we are completely separate from them. But we share the vast majority of our DNA with a chimp, or even a cow. And another thing I took away from that Goodall book is how surprisingly similar chimps\u2019 lives are to our own, though of course there are immense differences too. \n\nSomething that always amazes me is that we\u2019re related to every living thing on the planet if you go back enough generations.", "created_utc": "1638742162.0", "edited": "1638742802.0", "id": "hndpns9", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_r8gc4i", "parent_id": "t1_hnde69x", "score": "1", "subreddit": "collapse", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhw9"}, {"author": "mysteriouspyramid", "body": "It\u2019s exploded up here.

The water was muddy and it was making a deafening roar. Families were gathered around on the bridge and on the grass by the creek, laughing and not on their phones much.

He was cold and dismissive to me for years of my childhood, not even looking me in the eyes, or smiling at me. He paid a lot more attention to my brother too, which was hurtful. Later this turned into him yelling at me, calling me names and sometimes dragging me out of my bed when I was depressed and didn\u2019t want to go to school. Even the past few years he was mean to me sometimes, like when I told him I had chosen Colombia as the country I was traveling to alone. He had called me on the phone and I explained to him that it isn\u2019t nearly as dangerous as it was in the 90s and even compared rates of violent crimes of Colombian cities to cities in the US. But it didn\u2019t work; he hung up on me and never apologized for that or even acknowledged it later.\n\nSo even though I know it can\u2019t be true, I\u2019m afraid that he subconsciously knew I was going to have this conversation with him and he couldn\u2019t handle being faced with his poor treatment of me over the years.\n\nAnd the fact is, I won\u2019t ever know how that conversation would have gone. I think that\u2019s why I have so many dreams where I do confront him, or the dream where he was piloting a plane to New York City and had to make it through a tiny gap between skyscrapers. He couldn\u2019t quite make it and had to fly back around to try once more, and I was holding on to the plane. My hands were getting sore and I didn\u2019t know how much longer I could keep holding on for. \n\nThe last time I saw him, I told my parents I was planning on switching therapists because my former therapist didn\u2019t engage with me about my past trauma. I was referring in large part to how he had treated me, and when I said that, I saw the corner of his mouth twitch slightly.\n\nEven at the time, that twitch stood out to me, as a sign that he wasn\u2019t saying something (he was a secretive person).

My ex died on Christmas. An old classmate killed themselves in late May. My friend was killed in another state a couple of months ago.\n\nAll of these deaths have been related to mental illness or violence. It's really hard to bear and I keep having nightmares although they seem to be getting better now. I've contemplated suicide in the past so it's really weird to be the one surviving it rather than the one doing it.\n\nMy Dad's death was down to his personal suffering, but it also has a lot to do with the pressures men face in our world. He never knew how to express emotions in a healthy way, and he seems to have always chased material success when that wasn't what he needed in order to feel better. He didn't treat me so well but I miss him.\n\nI'm living in a house with a bunch of housemates, but we're all leaving when our lease is up because our new landlord is the worst. He's a slumlord. He hires a seemingly indifferent and/or incompetent handyman to do \"fixes\" that just make the house's problems worse. And last week he took my window with no warning and replaced it with a piece of styrofoam. I got him to replace the window the next day, but he replaced it with literally the same window I had before. Which had absolutely nothing wrong with it (aside from me not being able to escape in the case of a fire--they were supposed to replace it with a cranked window!)\n\nMy housemate's theory is that they needed to replace a window on another house, so they just took mine, thinking they'd replace it whenever they finally got around to buying a new window for my room. Which is insane, and so so stupid, to leave a tenant with no window. It made me so mad.\n\nBut reading about the condo collapse in Florida has shown me parallels between that case and our \"landlord\" albeit on a much smaller scale. Profit is valued above safety or the health of tenants. There's a structural problem not only with our buildings but with the systems we have created that reward those people that only care about making money. That's the shaky ground that we live on.\n\nI've spent a lot of time and resources this year growing a garden in the back of this house. It's doing really well and I've been distributing vegetables from it to friends and coworkers. I hope to find more people in need of fresh vegetables to give them to as well. Right now the nasturtiums are covered in luscious orange flowers, the tomatoes are so big I've started pruning them, and the cucumbers seem happy indeed. Some of the corn I planted even survived a neighborhood cat's assault and is about three feet tall already.\n\nIt makes me sad that when I leave here, the landlord will probably just trash the garden out of carelessness. At least I've created something that is pretty and good for me though, and learned about growing food in this climate. I just wish that our world was set up in such a way that the people who end up owning property cared more about the things that really matter.\n\nAnyway, it's not hard to see why people are despairing when we're surrounded by a world that places more value on money than on health, well-being or nature.

I even tried to convince a doctor it was possible I was about to progress to foaming at the mouth, lol.\n\nOf course I turned out to be fine. Something that helped me was to realize that the physical \"symptoms\" I was having were also symptoms that can be caused by anxiety: tingling sensations, throat tightness and so on. I ended up finding physical things to distract myself from them and get more in my body, like chewing on strongly flavored herbs and going for runs. It was still awful but that helped me get through it. Whenever I'm anxious my therapist tells me to \"get in (my) body,\" which I sometimes roll my eyes at a bit but honestly often helps!
