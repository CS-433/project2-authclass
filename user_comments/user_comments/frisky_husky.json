How I talk to my mom when I get home shouldn't matter--I agree with that. But if I, as a native speaker, am told that I am automatically correct--that my speech justifies itself--what happens when I want to read Dickens, who doesn't write the way I talk? What happens when I make a scientific discovery, and want to communicate that to a colleague 10,000 miles away, who doesn't talk the way I talk?\n\nLanguage education, in my opinion, should be about giving students the linguistic and analytical skills to speak, read, and write fluently in a variety of registers. A politician's speech, a pastor's sermon, a scientist's report, and a novelist's prose are all different registers of the same language. The one I speak at home or with my friends is another. And, while no person's native speech is inherently better or worse than another person's, it can be more poorly suited to a certain register, which will inhibit that person's ability to contribute to that area of society.

Didn't have time for a thorough reading, but from a skim it seems like the crux of her argument is that there simply wasn't enough political cohesion among Vietnamese leftists post-1945 to hold on to power without making institutional concessions to non-communist elements of society, and the Vietnamese Communist Party has consistently shown a relative willingness to give those on the wrong side of its reforms a bit of political cover. Basically, because of the relative disorganization within the Vietnamese left, it was more difficult for the functions of the party and the state to fuse entirely, and the party-state apparatus had to find ways to accommodate and respond to discord without jeopardizing its own position. \n\nThe CCP, on the other hand, was extremely centralized under Mao, both politically and ideologically. The CCP's relative discipline meant that it was able to get by making relatively fewer concessions to non-CCP elements once the Chinese Civil War was won. You could possibly argue that the Cultural Revolution *couldn't* have happened in Vietnam, because there had never been enough ideological hegemony at the cadre level to allow it.\n\nIn Vietnam's case, because state formation (i.e. total independence from France) was seen as the necessary immediate precursor to the creation of a socialist state, Vietnamese communists couldn't simply seize the reins, they had to create the institutional trappings from scratch, and they didn't have the political clout to shape these around the party itself. What this means is that, in Vietnam's case, governmental institutions arbitrate the political decisions resulting from party politics, whereas in China, decisions are delegated downward from party institutions to bureaucratic ones. This may seem like a minute distinction if both systems are controlled by a single party, but it means that the Vietnamese system doesn't require total elite-level cohesion as a precondition for governmental action, because the governmental institutions can arbitrate between different political currents within the party relatively autonomously. This also makes the system more permeable, as it frees the party up to absorb social demands, rather than reacting to them as a threat to the elite consensus which precedes government decision making.\n\nTl;dr: It's a good paper, and worth a read. My take away is that Vietnam has a bit more in common institutionally with other non-Communist party-dominated states in its neighborhood (Malaysia, Singapore) than I'd thought.

They have very limited soft power, and countries in their neighborhood are largely more interested in containing them than deferring to them, which is usually a pretty good indicator of superpower potential.\n\nThe United States, during its rise, maintained generally cordial relations with other countries in the Americas (though we meddled in their business constantly). There was certainly widespread concern in Canada about what it meant to have a dominant global power next door, but the resulting approach was to keep relations with the US as friendly as possible, and to emphasize the long history of peaceful coexistence and shared culture. China's rise has largely alienated even its ideologically-aligned neighbors, like Vietnam, which has grown much closer to the US (good luck predicting that in 1973). China's posturing in the region, especially in the South China Sea, threatens its neighbors politically and (especially) economically, and countries like Vietnam risk being cut off from key trade routes by Chinese territorial claims, which would strangle their economy.\n\nChina also has a demographic problem, which means they have an economic problem. Chinese growth has plateaued, and it is now clear that a significant portion of China's booming economy was essentially Potemkin growth, that is to say capital development that outpaces underlying growth in productivity or demand, producing a facade of progress without much to maintain it, and major capital development always requires ongoing maintenance. This is why you see Chinese cities imploding brand new apartment complexes that sat vacant. For all the investment China made in housing and infrastructure (a page I wish we'd borrow from their book), the economic returns lagged, because they were spending a lot of money on stuff they just didn't really need.\n\nChina has also struggled to get buy-in on a lot of its flagship economic initiatives. A lot of countries have started to waffle on Belt and Road. Big industrial policy projects like the development of a Chinese passenger aircraft industry have failed to make much of a dent in the global market. China was early to develop a vaccine for COVID, but it was less effective, and the government's refusal to consider alternatives arguably made the Delta and Omicron waves there worse than they needed to be. China rode out the first wave of COVID pretty effectively, but poor strategy amidst later waves choked the global economy while failing to contain the virus, and led a lot of other countries to question Chinese decision making, while beginning to consider how they could decouple their own economies from China's.\n\nDon't get me wrong, the average person in China today is certainly better off than they were a few decades ago, and that's a good thing, but the average person in China still has much less purchasing power than the average American or European, and per capita purchasing power is a pretty important component of economic power--it's not just about whose GDP is bigger (and in nominal terms, which we use when comparing between states, the US economy is still larger by most measures). The one-child policy has backfired, and there's some speculation that China has actually been padding their vital statistics. A population growth rate below replacement is almost always a bad thing for a country. Western countries have been able to offset this with immigration, but China hasn't.\n\nBasically, China's future looked pretty rosy in the 2000s and 2010, and it's still certainly got its size going for it, but all of the predictions about China displacing the US are starting to look a lot like the \"Japan is going to overtake us\" takes of the 1980s.

Britain was the most powerful country in the world, economically and politically, during the 19th century, and this meant that trends in British architecture proliferated to the rest of the English-speaking world. Of course, the full story is a bit more complex.\n\nVictorian architecture reflects, first, the emergence new architectural forms made possible by the transition away from an artisanal/cottage method of construction to largely industrial methods of construction. Second, Victorian architecture reflects a partial drift away from the \"classical\" Greek and Roman architectural idiom which dominated Europe and (later) the United States from Palladio really through the early 19th century. This went through ebbs and flows mainly dealing with how designers made use of curvature and ornamentation, but the fundamentals of the classical orders remained largely unquestioned. Even in England, where Gothic architecture had never truly died out, at least in religious architecture, classicism was far more fashionable.\n\nTo address the first point, the Industrial Revolution started in England, which dramatically transformed the country within the span of about a century from a largely rural one to a heavily urbanized one. Prior to the 18th century, urban population growth had been relatively slow for quite a long time. With industrialization, cities began to grow exponentially, and became physically much larger to accommodate increased populations, and economic production which was more heavily urbanized. Consequently, industrial methods were adapted to produce buildings as well. By applying industrial techniques, buildings could be constructed more quickly, easily, and precisely. Stones no longer needed to be quarried and hauled for each project. Bricks in standardized sizes could be purchased from huge industrial brickworks. Wood was processed at industrial sawmills, rather than being felled and hewn to order. The construction of a house ceased to be an organic process carried out by the homeowner and perhaps some friends and local artisans, and began to be a more industrial one, capable of being reproduced with essentially interchangeable parts.\n\nIn large-scale architecture, this shift is even more pronounced. Once iron and glass could be manufactured precisely, rather than wrought by a blacksmith, architects and engineers began to experiment with its structural potential almost immediately, first with bridges and greenhouses, and then with buildings. In 1864, Oriel Chambers, the first building with a metal structure and glass curtain wall (like a modern skyscraper) was completed in Liverpool. The building was mocked at the time, but its techniques were quickly adapted.\n\nAcross the Atlantic, where buildings are made of wood instead of masonry, an immigration boom was underway, and the largest industrial cities in America struggled to keep up with the growing demand for housing. Sometime in the 1830s, probably in Chicago, carpenters realized that long studs of consistently milled dimensional lumber could be used to erect multi-story buildings quickly through a method called balloon framing. Wood framing predates the balloon frame, but balloon framing makes it easy to build larger wooden buildings faster, provided you have easy access to lumber. The US, with its massive and then-untapped old-growth forests, did.\n\nThis enabled the shift in my second point. The construction techniques of Gothic architecture, which used intricate masonry work to create soaring vertical spaces, had been somewhat lost to time by the 19th century. Classical architecture relied on an (originally) structurally-determined order which was much better understood, and idealized as the \"rational\" architecture of the Enlightenment, a symbolic meaning that was embraced by both the young US and revolutionary France, neither of which were well regarded by many Brits. Gothic architecture, which had been unfashionable, began to undergo a rehabilitation in many parts of Europe , due in part to Romanticism's backlash against industrial society's alienation of the individual. Gothic architecture represented a prior flourishing of architecture dominated by the artisan, and was, conveniently, also the \"national\" architectural heritage of Britain (Germany and France also claimed it), the dominant power of the era. Ironically, it was the adaptability of industrial construction that enabled that allowed a Gothic Revival to take place. As craftsmen rediscovered the techniques of Gothic construction, architects began to expand its stylistic cues beyond what could be rendered in stone. Iron-frame construction was used to enable the construction of some of the grandest Neo-Gothic buildings of the era, like Manchester Town Hall and St. Pancras Station.\n\nIn the United States, the aesthetic trends which had begun in Europe spilled over. Gothic styling became popular in the US as well, often rendered in wood. In residential architecture, wealthy Americans borrowed elements of European architecture, again, usually rendered in wood. As the 19th century progressed, more elements fused into the architectural milieu, with the Arts and Crafts Movement and the Eastlake Movement both beginning in Britain before being adopted in America. Even the Italianate tendency within 19th century American architecture reflect Italian taste as interpreted by British architects like Thomas Cubitt, who designed many of London's stylish neighborhoods, and even Prince Albert, who designed Osborne House himself in an Italian style. The Paris-oriented Beaux-Arts style was influential in both Britain and America, but is largely treated separately. \n\nBasically, Britain under Queen Victoria, as the dominant country of the second half of the 19th century, played a crucial role in creating and disseminating the key architectural innovations which define what we now call Victorian architecture: industrial production of materials, a resulting increase in standardization of techniques and designs, and the re-entry of non-Classical design influences into Western architecture, including a greater emphasis on verticality through the innovative use of these materials and techniques.", "created_utc": "1666290018.0", "edited": "False", "id": "it3nsto", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_y8zsvy", "parent_id": "t3_y8zsvy", "score": "86", "subreddit": "AskHistorians", "subreddit_id": "t5_2ssp3"}, {"author": "frisky_husky", "body": "I would just use a slight alkaline solution if you want to cut acidity, but bitterness and sourness are not the same thing.

Looks like you already know the answer. \n\nThis doesn't always happen, but it's possible for increased density to simultaneously increase the value of land, while decreasing the price of housing/office space/etc., since you're essentially increasing the likely productive capacity of land. If a plot of land can accommodate 50 new units of housing in an appealing location, the value of that land is high, but building those units might actually cause local market rates for housing to drop due to the influx of new supply.\n\nThis is relevant to anti-development folks, because they tend to own *land,* rather than something like a condo or a share in a co-op (which is, technically speaking, not even real estate, but rather a share in a company which includes a guaranteed right to lease). Basically, if you own a condo or a co-op, you cant just tear the thing down and sell the land off to the highest bidder, or add additional units. You can't usually convert one condo into two condos, even when zoning code permits it. Landowners (referring to people with exclusive ownership over land, not just real estate) *do* have this ability, and thus the value of their land increases regardless of whether the market price of a unit of housing on that land increases. \n\nTechnically, this is also true for condominiums and co-op corporations, but far more difficult to realize. As a condo owner, you *do* own a share in the collective land of your condo. As a co-op member, you own a stake in the company which in turn owns real estate, and are entitled to a shareholder's vote. Either way, you own some kind of financial interest in land, but the structure of ownership means that you can't necessarily capitalize on increased land values directly, although you still stand to benefit from increases in value due to location and amenities as the local market becomes saturated (i.e., reaches optimal local density). \n\nIn practice, it's all about location. Prices will increase in desirable places because supply is almost always stickier, and these places tend to be dense cities with lots of amenities and economic activity, but they aren't always.

As others have mentioned, most coffee is grown in another part of the large country. \n\nObviously, not everybody can go to Ethiopia and pay a farmer cash for their beans, but I also trust my friend's judgement. I know that if they believed that they would not have done anything that they believed would contribute to the conflict, but Ethiopia is an incredibly poor country, so it's a tough ethical call to make. On the one hand, you don't want to fund the government's war. On the other, an economic boycott could exacerbate the conflict, and harm ordinary people in one of the world's poorest regions, one heavily reliant upon commodity agriculture and subsistence farming, and already prone to food instability and famine. \n\nPersonally, I studied public policy and international relations, with a thesis on how resource geography shapes the relationship between indigenous communities and the global political economy. For now, I've opted to keep drinking Ethiopian coffee from sources I trust (mostly the beans my friend brought back for me so far). If I want to buy Ethiopian coffee after those run out, I'll do my best to ensure that they're sourced in a conflict-sensitive way, and will also donate to a reputable NGO doing good work in Tigray. \n\nUnfortunately, Ethiopia is far from the only coffee-producing country where this is an issue. Indonesia is still involved in a prolonged conflict in West Papua. Honduras, Guatemala, Nicaragua, Colombia, and El Salvador are all coffee-producing countries where it's often hard to disentangle agricultural commodity production from brutal governments and paramilitaries. I could go on. It's not whataboutism--it's the reality of the choice we face, and the tradeoff between supporting a state and supporting people. In Rwanda, women-led coffee cooperatives have helped to bring education and economic opportunity to women in a post-conflict environment with an authoritarian government. These have been instrumental in moving later stages of coffee production (like roasting and sales) closer to production, when historically the economic value of those later stages was diverted elsewhere. Coffee is a coveted drink that a lot of people care deeply about. Is it impossible that someday coffee production is treated more like wine production? I don't think it is, and I think that would be a very good thing for a lot of these places.

Likewise, a shadow isn't a darker green, it's a green plus the complementary color of the light (or \"minus\" the color of the light, if you want to think of it that way). Usually, this means that we add purple for shadows in daylight, because on a clear day the sunlight usually skews a bit yellow, and the complementary color to yellow is purple.

I live in Boston now, and once I hit Berkshire County or get off I-93 at Bow Junction it starts to feel like \"home\" again, even if I'm still hours away. Northeast PA doesn't belong there though, and I think you do extend a bit far west even in NY. It starts to feel more \"Western New York\" not far past Schenectady, and even the coast of Lake Ontario up to the border often feels more similar to rural Michigan than it does to the Adirondacks. In some ways, it feels more \"Northwoods\", which actually makes sense since this part of New York is geologically more related to the Canadian Shield than to the regions which surround it. Since you've established with Mountain West that regions can be dis-contiguous, there's a kind of devil's advocate case to split Northern New York, with the Great Lakes-oriented portion in Northwoods, and the eastern portion lumped in with Northern Vermont, NH, and inland Maine. A lot of the towns up there are now-depressed lumber milling towns populated largely by descendants of French Canadian immigrants. Tupper Lake, NY and Berlin, NH feel very similar to be in. \n\nOn the other hand, Eastern New England is kind of a mess. There's a pretty contiguous \"Coastal New England\" cultural region that runs roughly along the coast from Portland down to maybe New London, stretching a bit inland. Certainly including Merrimack and Hillsborough Counties in NH, which are within the Boston commuter belt. Rhode Island and Southeastern MA are distinct enough to be their own sub-region, but it's still very much one cultural and economic zone. Not sure why Eastern Long Island is in there. There's definitely some old cultural similarities with Southern New England, but these are mostly eroded. I'd call Fisher's Island part of New England, and nothing else. If Buffalo and Chicago can be in the same region, so can Boston and Providence. \n\n\"Midlands\" is not a thing. There is nothing that unites Kansas City and Syracuse, NY other than a love of barbecue. There is nothing unifying or distinct about this region that others don't have. It also doesn't make sense to include coastal NJ with DC, Delaware, and Baltimore if you're going to exclude Philly from that.

You're just providing physical feedback that isn't hurting or upsetting the dog, and there's nothing wrong with gentle physical feedback to correct a physical behavior, as long as it isn't harmful or painful. I've found with my border collie that he actually *needs* some kind of physical input, because it's a lot harder to redirect their focus with just a treat or something. My dog has basically zero food motivation if there's anything else he finds interesting around, and so \"you have to redirect\" means I occasionally need to reach down and physically reorient him, because a treat just won't do it. Hell, sometimes a *ball* won't do it if he sees a bunny or something.\n\nSelf-ordained dog training zealots will take the concept of positive training and stretch it to mean that the dog shouldn't ever have to deal with a consequence. This doesn't work for the simple reason that the dog needs to have some consequence in order to understand that it's done something bad. Sure, you can give a dog a treat for not barking at children, but first you need to establish that barking at children makes people upset. You shouldn't ever do that through corporal punishment, but a correction is not equivalent to an aversive. And sometimes prevention is necessary. When my dog was a teenager, I had to rub all my laptop chargers in a hot pepper solution, because he went through a cable chewing phase. He stopped immediately. I'd rather rip that bandage off with something he doesn't like once, rather than waiting until he learns his lesson by getting electrocuted. \n\nFor what it's worth, I don't usually use a harness and I think that if my dog thought it was so awful he wouldn't constantly do it to himself. It's still not good for his neck, which is why I avoid doing it intentionally, but I don't think it upsets them in the way some people think it does.

Originalism refers to the school of constitutional interpretation which holds that the meaning or intent of the text should be held paramount when interpreting the present meaning of the law. People often mistakenly conflate this view with textualism, a perspective which is usually rooted in Scalia's tendency to advocate them as closely interdependent. At its purest, textualism is the view that the extent of the law is evident solely from the word of the law as read according to \"ordinary meaning\", and that the application of the law should not be overly concerned with the *intended* *outcome.* Scalia's originalism focuses on what he refers to as *original meaning*, which he understands as the meaning of the text as it would have been interpreted by a plain reading at the time of its adoption. Other forms of originalism focus on what is referred to as *original intent,* which considers what the intended outcome of the law was, according to its authors. Scalia claims to reject this outright. \n\nProblematically, in his actual interpretation of constitutional cases, including *Heller*, I think Scalia extracts conclusions which are blatantly incongruent with both originalist schools of thought. The crux of Scalia's argument is that there exists an \"unorganized militia\" consisting of the whole population of armed private individuals. This is a line of reasoning with absolutely no precedent in constitutional interpretation, including at the time of adoption, in both outcome and intent--both of which held that the militia was specifically organized under the initiative of the state, for the state's own purposes. \n\nProponents of original intent would point to Hamilton's argument in Federalist 29, which firmly places responsibility for the ordinary maintenance of a militia under the purview of the states, while granting a federal government ultimate authority. Stevens argues that, in the context of the argument made by Fletcher in 1698, from which much of the language is directly drawn, the right to keep and bear arms is specifically collective (as evidenced by the use of *the* people, rather than just *people*), and relates directly to the maintenance of militias under devolved authority. The language was adopted in the direct aftermath of the national government's difficulties in suppressing Shay's Rebellion, which was ultimately done largely by a privately financed militia under the command of General Lincoln, who had raised the force upon request by Governor Bowdoin of Massachusetts. As Shay's Rebellion had been in communication with the British in Quebec, the concern that privately raised militias threatened the continued independence of the United States was an explicit cause behind the creation of a constitutional convention. As it is often said (including by my law professor), even assuming an individual right *was* originally intended, it was to bear a musket.\n\nWith regard to original meaning, as interpreted around the time of the law's adoption, there is *still* a strong challenge to any originalist argument for an individual right to bear arms. As Stevens contends in his dissent, the wording of the amendment alludes to stock language which would have been known to contemporary interpreters of the law, for reasons unrelated to the authors' actual intent. If I write a constitution that states \"The wealth of the society shall be distributed from each according to his ability, to each according to his needs,\" any interpreter of the law at the time of its adoption would immediately recognize this common phrase as part of a Marxist idiom. And, in fact, we know that this *was* the contemporary interpretation of the Second Amendment, because it was ratified in December 1791, as the Whiskey Rebellion was already beginning to take shape, and the Militia Act of 1792 was quickly passed to ensure the federal government's ability to respond. The rebels' right to raise a militia outside the purview of the state was explicitly rejected, which directly challenges Scalia's \"unorganized militia\" argument having any shred of historical precedent. If originalism seeks to identify what a contemporary legislator would have interpreted as the meaning of the text at the time of its adoption, then we have our answer.\n\nFinally, and this is somewhat unrelated, *Heller* overturns both precedent and a statute without (I believe) convincing evidence that the case actually merited strict scrutiny. There was no suspect classification, and the implementation of the law fell within the bounds of rational interest (a rational interest which had been repeatedly upheld), and did not curtail a right on the basis of suspect classification.", "created_utc": "1662761844.0", "edited": "1662762428.0", "id": "ins8imc", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_xa13po", "parent_id": "t3_xa13po", "score": "11", "subreddit": "AskHistory", "subreddit_id": "t5_2sa8i"}, {"author": "frisky_husky", "body": "Newfoundland, I assume?", "created_utc": "1662746187.0", "edited": "False", "id": "inr6ngf", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_x9rkv1", "parent_id": "t3_x9rkv1", "score": "4", "subreddit": "Oldhouses", "subreddit_id": "t5_3atfs"}, {"author": "frisky_husky", "body": "It's not an obscure language, but I think Persian is criminally under-studied in the West outside of a security/intelligence context.

So while this is not the only reason that the French Canadians weren't lured over to the American cause, it was relevant that they had just (after some years of effort) had the core of their social order legally protected by the British, and their elites were in no mood to risk that by joining another war which they were, at that point, seen as unlikely to win.\n\nSome Acadians who had been deported during the Seven Years' War had returned by the time of the Revolutionary War, in addition to the third or so who had remained. I probably inaccurately portrayed their numbers relative to the British settlers, but the population of the Maritimes was still small relative to the Thirteen Colonies. The pattern of population was established, yes, but they hadn't quite reached a critical mass. The major population event in the demographic history of Nova Scotia *was* the Revolution, and the ensuing migration of loyalists from New York and New England.\n\nAs for the proportion of loyalists in the Thirteen Colonies, you're correct, and I had my numbers backwards. I'm going to edit that in my original reply. As for where the substantial wave of emigrants went, however, I've gotta stick to my guns. Most went to the Maritimes, and probably only a few thousand went to what is now Ontario, which was still part of Qu\u00e9bec at that point, but they made up a far larger share of what was then a region with very little European settlement. The number that went to the Maritimes was probably in excess of 30,000 if you trust Jasanoff's numbers from *Liberty's Exiles* (2011), which I do. Subsequent waves strongly favored Ontario, which has more arable land, at the same time that Anglo-Americans began migrating into the regions just across the lakes.\n\nFinally, America enforced a partial-blockade on the Maritimes during the Civil War, as Britain was tacitly favoring the South early in the war.

The area\u2019s vulnerability to American encroachment (especially during the Civil War) was one of the key drivers behind the political reorganization of the remaining British colonies, which was seen as necessary for the stability of the region.", "created_utc": "1662228024.0", "edited": "1662232945.0", "id": "imyck65", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_x4ut28", "parent_id": "t3_x4ut28", "score": "1", "subreddit": "geography", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qnms"}, {"author": "frisky_husky", "body": "I never liked bread and butter pickles, but they felt appropriate so I made my own, and I have to say they were a revelation.

Prior to Cromwell, parts of Ireland had nominally been vassals of the English crown, but outside of Dublin it didn't actually bear that much on the lives of the ordinary Irish prior to the English Reformation. This is before the era of the nation-state, and it was perfectly common for a European country to be ruled by someone with no affinity to the area. This was, by and large, accepted practice, as long as the ruler was the same religion. By the time Cromwell came to power, the Stuarts had already begun settling Ireland as a quasi-colony with English and Scottish Protestants, but many of these settlers also had religious views reviled by Cromwell's Puritans, and were brutalized as well.\n\nCromwell's conquest of Ireland, fought against the Irish Catholic Confederation allied to the English crown, was extraordinarily bloody. Without going through the entire history of modern Ireland, Cromwell retaliated against Irish resistance by stripping the local elites of their lands and titles, with many families forced into exile. Many Irish were punished through penal transportation to America and the West Indies, where a large portion of the population to this day is of mixed Irish and African descent. Land and power were redistributed to British landlords, establishing a social and economic order dominated by landowning British Protestants which lasted until the 20th century. This system kept Ireland firmly agrarian while much of Western Europe industrialized. Arguably, the demographic and economic devastation of the Potato Famine was a direct consequence, as the potato monoculture had been deliberately introduced as a staple of the Irish diet by English landlords. \n\nThe accuracy can be debated, but the common historical narrative in Ireland blames Cromwell not only for the brutality his regime carried out directly, but for Ireland's later subjugation under an English elite--an economic order which kept Ireland's standard of living well behind the rest of Western Europe until the 1980s.

Arguably, this is the standout group, because it can draw from the other two, and politicians both shape and act upon public sentiment. A city council member has already done the tough work of getting elected, and the community is more likely to defer to them on that basis than to an un-elected bureaucrat, however qualified. \n\nI'm not a planner, but my advice having worked in urban government, electoral politics, and community activism is this: citizens are most effective when organizing around specific solvable problems. \"East Side Moms Against Potholes in Bike Lanes\" will be more effective in getting things fixed than \"Citizens for Better Bike Lanes in General\". Citizen groups are optimized to address problems, politicians to address underlying issues, and bureaucrats to deal with matters of process, and to fine tune the machine.

There\u2019s a strong cultural taboo against pork across the Semitic world which predates Islam. Note that many Jews also shun pork, and this was the case at least by the time the Torah reached its codified form\u2014the Babylonian period at the latest. Other Semitic cultures, including the Phoenicians, were known to prohibit pork, or even the keeping of pigs.\n\nChristians generally don\u2019t avoid pork, because the bulk of Christanity\u2019s spread occurred within a Hellenistic and Roman cultural milieu, and was not accompanied by a spread in Semitic culture. On the other hand, the spread of Islam corresponded with a large migration event, and the Arabization of large swaths of the world. Those who were not Arabized nonetheless adopted these norms. Notably, Orthodox Christians in Ethiopia and Eritrea who *are* culturally Semitic prohibit pork consumption. Semitic Christians in the Eastern Mediterranean don\u2019t generally have a religious prohibition on pork, but it is only widely eaten where there is a stronger European cultural influence. Armenians and Greeks (both non-Semitic) commonly consume pork without any taboo, and in many cases perhaps did so to deliberately distinguish their Christian culture from their Muslim neighbors. \n\nThe pork taboo generally spread with Islam, but not everywhere. In Albania, one of the last Muslim-majority regions to adopt Islam, pork is widely eaten by many Muslims and Christians alike, reflecting European dietary norms, rather than Islamic ones. That said, Albania was known for its relatively lax approach to certain Islamic laws, and that was *before* five decades of state secularism under the communist regime. \n\nPork taboos exist in other hot, relatively dry climates. While Hindus who eat meat generally do not specifically ban pork, it is not commonly consumed, possibly due to prolonged Muslim cultural influence in India. Anthropologists generally think that the taboo emerged because pigs are opportunistic feeders rather than herbivores, and therefore will eat scraps of whatever they could find, including trash and carrion. Pigs are adaptable animals, but they prefer cooler climates, and especially forests where they can eat nuts and seeds.

A lot of people will buy some frozen foods to keep around for days when you're too busy to cook, but most people I know more commonly buy individual ingredients frozen, like shrimp or peas, which they can store for a long time and cook whenever they need.\n\nBecause of how many cultures we have here, Americans have pretty diverse tastes, and it's kind of unusual for someone to eat the same type of dish or cuisine all the time. At least where I live, a vaguely Italian-American hybrid tends to be the thing that people eat most often (I have no Italian heritage, and this is true of me as well), and it's usually the first thing you'll learn to cook. Pasta with tomato sauce is cheap and easy to make, and it's easy to get creative by adding things to it. A lot of people start with that before they learn to make other things. A lot of the popular one-pot dishes you see on the internet will be sort of Italian-inspired in their flavor profile, because that's what a lot of people eat regularly anyway.\n\nThe standard dinner formula here would be some kind of meat/protein, some kind of starch, and vegetables, often all cooked separately and served together. This seems to be changing with the generations though. Most people my age (mid-20s) don't cook like this most of the time. There used to be posters in home economics classrooms at school with pictures of plates that had appropriate servings of meat, vegetables, and carbohydrates for a balanced diet (or what the science of the day considered appropriate), and many of my dinners growing up looked basically like that, often with fish or chicken. The ones that didn't probably came from a Martha Stewart cookbook.\n\nThe US is a big country, and it depends on who you are and where you live. If you're of Chinese descent, you might make more Chinese food at home because that's what you're most familiar with. If you're Mexican, you might make more Mexican food. But most people cook lots of foods from cultures they have no connection to. My mom got a recipe for this Afghan dish from a friend of a friend, and now she makes it maybe 3 times a month. \n\nThe best thing about America is that you can get just about any food you could think of, and someone here probably makes it really well. Europeans stereotype American food as greasy, bland, and full of ketchup and processed cheese, and I always feel the need to push back. I've had great meals in Europe, and I've had great meals in America. I've also had terrible meals both places.

Let's break down the sentence:\n\nMain clause--> *My life has become better*... This does not vary between the examples. It is in the present perfect progressive, which tells us that the action occurring (becoming better) started in the past and is still ongoing. If your life stopped getting better at some point, you would say \"My life *had* become better\" in the pluperfect.\n\nSubordinate clause--> *than I (have/had) ever imagined.* Because \"than\" is a subordinating conjugation, the subordinate clause does not need to be parallel in structure to the main clause--only equal clauses need to have parallel structure. \n\nIn sentence one, \"than I have ever imagined\" is also in the present perfect progressive, which means that you are *continuing* to imagine how good your life can be, and that these expectations continue to be beaten. A similar correct sentence would be \"He has performed better than I have expected.\" You are continually setting expectations, and he is continually exceeding them. While not incorrect, this can be a bit awkward in many cases.\n\nIn sentence two, \"than I had ever imagined\" is in the pluperfect, which means that at some point in the past you imagined regularly, but you stopped at a certain point. A native speaker might use this when reminiscing about the present as compared to a particular point in the past--to me this sounds like something someone might say on their deathbed. Again, not incorrect, but sometimes awkward.\n\nIn sentence three, \"than I ever imagined\" is in the simple past. The simple past is typically used when a single action is occurring at a point in time which is clear from context. It does *not* need to be a specific or named point in time, as in some languages, but both speaker and recipient should know roughly when the action happened in relation to other relevant actions. if no specific time frame is given, the action is assumed to have occurred recently. \"Ever\" can serve this role as well, referring to any individual time you imagined. It's not grammatically necessary because the action in the subordinate clause is given context by the main clause, but it emphasizes the speaker's surprise.\n\nI would choose 3 most frequently, and maybe 2 on occasion. In this particular case, I would probably never use 1. There are cases in which that structure is technically appropriate, but native speakers rarely use it, at least in the US.

Of course, the exact recipe of that sauce will vary between restaurants, families, or dishes. Sometimes it might have onion, fennel, etc., or sometimes just tomato, salt, and oil. Even a sauce with meat like a ragu napoletano (which is more common here than the Northern-style Bolognese that has very little tomato in it, if any) falls under the umbrella of 'red sauce'. It's not a very specific term at all, but, at least in the Northeast where I live, we often use it to refer to a particular type of old Italian-American style cooking which prominently features hearty tomato-based dishes with some kind of ancestral connection to Southern Italy or Sicily. It's often used in contrast to more modern-style Italian restaurants which focus on recreating dishes as they exist across Italy, and which often have influences from northern and central Italy. Very few Italian Americans are of Northern Italian descent. As a rule of thumb, Southern Italians largely migrated to the US, while Northern Italians largely went to Argentina, Uruguay, and Brazil, which reflects in their food as well.\n\nWhat exactly constitutes \"pizza sauce\" will depend on where you are, as American pizzas vary heavily by region. Here in the Northeast, standard pizza sauce is usually uncooked or minimally cooked, with only tomato, salt, oil, and *possibly* garlic, basil, and/or oregano. The sauce cooks in the oven as the pizza cooks. In other parts of the US, pizza sauce is more cooked, and it might contain onion, more herbs and spices, or even some wine, which I actually think is incredibly tasty on a Sicilian style pizza. The common denominator is that pizza sauce is usually pureed smooth, so it is easier to spread on a pizza.\n\nPasta sauce is about as vague as it comes. Any red sauce could be a pasta sauce, or pasta sauce could just be tomatoes and oil. Saying \"pasta sauce\" in a recipe would be a signal to the reader to use whatever tomato-based pasta sauce they like, because it won't make much difference in the end result. \n\nBasically, it's all tomato sauces with minor variations, and if a recipe is that vague then it doesn't matter all that much which kind you use.", "created_utc": "1660581008.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ikefjdb", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_wp1eu5", "parent_id": "t3_wp1eu5", "score": "2", "subreddit": "Cooking", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh7f"}, {"author": "frisky_husky", "body": "Silk Road in East Cambridge.

But people, like cultures, are complicated, and they will always have wonderful and infuriating elements. It takes time to understand them as a whole, and you'll never see it all at once.\n\nFalling in love with a culture is the same. At first, you only see the good things, and the moment you scratch beneath the surface you feel naive, like you've reduced a society to its most palatable elements. But that's *good*. That's you realizing that there's more to a culture than the pretty bits you see on TV. The antidote to your friend's superficial view of latino cultures is not for her to ignore them entirely, but to learn more and appreciate the internal diversity, and the conflicts, and the challenges. If you feel that you're fetishizing French culture, the solution is not to withdraw out of fear of the unknown other, but to dig deeper. I promise you that the things that you find appealing *are* real, and that the deeper understanding which language facilitates will only make you appreciate them more. But you've hit that second stage, in which you can only see the doubt, and how it reflects back on you. Push through, and you'll come to appreciate the best parts of a culture without feeling like you've ignored everything unsavory.\n\nIf all else fails, remember this: France is a country which has consistently and aggressively exported a particular image of itself, both through hard power in the form of colonialism, and soft power, in the form of art, music, cinema, fashion, and business. France is not mad that you find French culture attractive. They *want* you to find it attractive. Nor are you complicit in the worst aspects of French society by finding it attractive, so long as you are willing to take the good with the bad. In just about every culture, the interesting, appealing, and vibrant aspects of our shared humanity outweigh the more unfortunate tendencies that all human societies grapple with. So long as you know that those *will* exist everywhere--here in the US, in every Latin American society, and any culture you might take an interest in, you will be better off pursuing deeper knowledge, rather than balking at it.", "created_utc": "1660327192.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ik0wahx", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_wmn8n0", "parent_id": "t3_wmn8n0", "score": "21", "subreddit": "learnfrench", "subreddit_id": "t5_2sucz"}, {"author": "frisky_husky", "body": "Not necessarily a spicy one ,but the sinking of the USS *Maine* in the port of Havana was not the result of a Spanish bombing.

If you're doing French, German, Spanish, or Italian you're probably fine to keep using Duolingo for practice while incorporating other resources. I started using Duolingo for French after I already reached \\~B2 through traditional classes and was returning to the language in college. It was helpful to just place out of the early levels and grind as much as I could to just get in that frame of thought again. You'll never become fluent through Duolingo alone, as anyone will tell you, but that's true of any  resource you could name. That doesn't make it useless.\n\nMy advice is that once you feel confident with the language in Duolingo (not fluent, obviously, but like you have a grip on what it's like) see if you can buy or borrow a traditional textbook. There's usually resources online, but you also might be able to get them through a library. Nearly all public libraries have some foreign language resources. Work through grammar exercises, and find vocab packs online to supplement. Memrise and Anki have lots of available packs. Grammar you might learn best by using, but if you try to learn vocab organically it just takes forever. It's dull, but you save yourself time in the long run just drilling vocab on flash cards.\n\nIt depends heavily on the target language, though. I'm currently learning Swedish, and finding the process quite different from how I learned French, and not just because I'm doing self-study instead of classes.

It was first spoken only in the Southeast of the Scotland Lowlands, but gradually spread north and became the main administrative language of the Kingdom of Scotland by the time of the Reformation, as the Lowlands were more densely populated. Notably, Gaelic persisted in rugged Southwestern Scotland for much longer, with Scots to the north and English to the south. Scots differs somewhat in vocabulary, pronunciation, and Grammar (albeit more slightly). This is where the distinctly Scottish words come from. By the time of the Enlightenment, Scots had become somewhat stigmatized among the elite, and the written standard reflected Scots as a sort of incomplete or nonstandard dialect of English, which had historically not been its status in Scotland. This is where you get spellings like *wi'* for English \"with\" and *o'* for English \"of\". Both of those words *are* the native Scots words, but the writing system adapted to treat them as nonstandard abbreviations of their English equivalents.\n\nBecause of England's political, economic, and cultural primacy within Britain, Scots became subsumed under standard English, and largely defined in relation to it. There is no clearly defined point when Scottish English ends and Scots begins, and many people mix Scots and English words in conversation, since the similar grammar makes it easy to pick and choose vocabulary as you wish. That said, at the opposite ends of the spectrum, Scots and English are quite different. With some adjustment, an English speaker can usually *understand* Scots at its most distinct, but they probably couldn't speak it correctly (on the other hand all Scots speakers can both understand and speak standard English). \n\nThis asymmetric intelligibility is typical of varieties which straddle the ambiguous line between language and dialect, where the definition becomes highly subjective. Importantly, Scots is the only language which has such a relationship with English, which impacts mutual perception, whereas this arrangement is common in many non-insular language groups. In much of Europe, distinct regional languages are spoken on a continuum with standard languages, but are only partially intelligible in their most divergent forms. Low German's relationship with Dutch and High German is similarly debated (though most linguists treat it as a separate language). Perhaps the most similar case is that of the Scandinavian languages, especially Danish and Norwegian. They are closely related, diverged around the same time as English and Scots, have largely similar vocabulary and grammar, and are very similar in their written forms. Bokm\u00e5l, the most common standard of written Norwegian, was actually derived from written Danish while Norway and Denmark were part of the same kingdom, in much the same way that written Scots has been based on English standards for the last few centuries. Most Norwegians have no trouble reading Danish, and vice versa. In their most divergent spoken forms, however, they are quite different. Some more remote Norwegian dialects are even hard for other Norwegians to understand. Usually, speakers are able to understand each other with some adjustment, as with English and Scots, but wouldn't be able to simply switch to speaking in one or the other without a bit of learning, though it would probably be quite easy.\n\nI'm by no means proficient in spoken Scots, but I do enjoy reading it, and as a descendant of Robert Burns I often feel compelled to defend the honor of Scots as a distinct linguistic tradition. I think it's great that this tradition is accessible to English speakers, as long as we remember that not everything we understand belongs to us, and that the best way to appreciate Scots as a historical and living tradition is engaging with it on its own terms, rather than through English standards.", "created_utc": "1659631854.0", "edited": "False", "id": "iixqw3b", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_wfnx2l", "parent_id": "t3_wfnx2l", "score": "16", "subreddit": "linguistics", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhos"}, {"author": "frisky_husky", "body": "Absolutely speak English to your child, and between each other.

More likely, you'll live in a landlord special triple decker with mildewed vinyl siding from 1982 and a chain link fence, on a block full of other triple deckers with vinyl siding and chain link fences. It will *still* cost an arm and a leg. This is honestly my biggest complaint about Boston proper--outside the expensive neighborhoods it's a very *beige* city. Good luck finding a reasonably priced apartment that doesn't have the strangest kitchen you've ever seen in your life (the Boston Special is a stove and fridge that aren't attached to any of the counters). And storage? Forget about it. It's fine though, because we all move on the same day and you won't be able to fit it all into the only U-Haul you can find, which is also in Nashua since you only booked 3 months in advance. You won't be able to afford it either, after *you* (not the landlord!) pay the apartment's listing agent a whole month's rent for the white-glove service of taking 3 blurry iPhone photos and unlocking a door.\n\nGet micro spikes for walking in the winter.

It's not like it's impossible to make friends by any means, especially if you have kids or work a job with other young people, or are involved in some kind of organization, but you need to know somebody. In my experience, social groups here tend to be close-knit. If you know someone who can let you in, that helps a lot, but don't expect to just be able to go up to a group at a bar, strike up a conversation, and get invited to someone's party. \n\nFinally, the city revolves around higher education. The other sectors of the economy that exist here largely depend on proximity to top tier research universities--everybody is tied to it in some way or another, whether or not they even went to college. This is true socially, culturally, economically, and geographically. It's not like college towns elsewhere in the US that are basically company towns with more frat parties.

It would be seen as similarly odd to say \"Go talk to that thin over there,\" or \"My boss is a left handed.\" Both would imply, to many English speakers, that you are prejudiced against these traits for some reason. The main exception seems to be certain hair colors, specifically the ones most common in the British Isles--blond (or blonde/towhead, etc.), red (or ginger/redhead), and brown (or brunette). No idea if there's a historical reason for it, but black hair, which was historically much less common in England, doesn't have a commonly used noun. In English, traits are generally treated (with certain exceptions) as adjectives in polite speech. When used as a noun, it is understood as applying to the individual as representative of a whole group, which is taken to imply stereotyping. Constructions like \"The Chinese enjoys eating noodles\" used to be common, but are no longer used because they imply that any given Chinese person will possess certain traits, and that those traits are due to innate characteristics of their race, not personal or cultural preferences. Any grouping that ends in -ese, -ish, or similar endings like -ch or -sh (Chinese, Spanish, Dutch) is plural by default, and making it singular will imply that the individual represents the group, and therefore the stereotype. Endings like -an, -ian, -i, -man (Norwegian, American, Englishman, Israeli), or sans English suffix (like Turk, Greek, Scot) can be singular, and can sometimes be used as a singular noun without being considered offensive.\n\nThis brings us to the cultural and historical reason why English speakers consider this offensive: throughout relatively recent history, it *was.* Racial pseudoscience persisted well into the 20th century, and was used to justify colonization, subjugation, and horrific abuses of human dignity, on the grounds that individual people, as representatives of the groups to which they belonged, were automatically predisposed to the \"worst\" (as determined by their self-appointed racial superiors) tendencies of their race. This belief underpinned the mythology of benevolent colonialism as a civilizing force across the English-speaking world, and also was used to justify violence and discrimination against non-white or non-Anglo people in Britain, the US, Australia, Canada, and elsewhere. The language of this ideology was meant to sound scientific, because individuals were seen as sample specimens of their races, not as individuals with preferences, ideas, talents, and personalities. Again, there are specific exceptions, generally applying to nationalities which were not historically discriminated against by English speakers.

I suspect what you're really asking is how long unwritten *archaic* languages can be orally transmitted mostly intact, even when the spoken variety has evolved substantially. \n\nPlenty of Vedic Sanskrit survived through oral transmission, but it was being written down in the Brahmi script by the first century CE. By this point spoken Sanskrit had evolved into the Prakrits, but Vedic and Classical Sanskrit remained in use as administrative and liturgical languages. Old Avestan (the oldest attested Iranian language) was transmitted orally as a Zoroastrian liturgical language until *well* into the Common Era (probably until the 6th century), despite being incredibly archaic. It likely hadn't been spoken in far more than a millennium, as its morphology suggests that it was contemporary with Vedic Sanskrit. \n\nThe Baltic languages were not attested in writing until the 14th century, but Old Prussian and Lithuanian in particular exhibit some very conservative features which were common in many archaic Indo-European languages, but had long since died out in all other branches. Contemporary spoken Lithuanian is still regarded as the most conservative living Indo-European language, and retains many of these archaic features. Interestingly, Latvian, its closest living relative, is very innovative, despite only branching off from Lithuanian around the 10th century CE, and lost most of these archaic features. Neither language is \"older\" than the other, since the modern varieties both evolved over time from the same ancestor, but spoken Lithuanian retained features which Latvian lost.\n\nSo, if we're allowing evolution in vernacular languages which are exclusively spoken, there is no oldest language, since all language has evolved over time. Considering only archaic languages, which preserved an older form through oral transmission, it's hard to tell, since a language which has *never* been written does not have old source texts to refer to, and you have to resort to the comparative method, which is unreliable on its own, since shared features could be either retained from a proto-language, or innovated and spread. Language changes in many ways, so without a written record across related languages, it's hard to determine how and when contemporary varieties evolved. There are Aboriginal Australian communities with remarkably accurate oral histories recounting events corroborated in the geological record tens of thousands of years into the past, but as these languages were not written prior to colonization, we don't have historical forms to rely upon, which makes it difficult to tell how archaic the specific language used in recounting the oral history actually is.

Contrast that to, say, the Hungarians, for whom the Uralic genetic legacy is basically nonexistent. The historical population shift was not just locals adopting Turkish language and culture--there was also a large-scale migration event, the legacy of which is visible in genetic studies. Notably, however, there is a much higher degree of genetic variation within the population which identifies as ethnically Turkish, which reflects a prolonged history of mass migration, intermarriage, and assimilation. In this part of the world, that should come as no surprise. The Ottoman Empire was divided administratively along the lines of religion, not ethnicity, so Muslim ethnic groups mingled with other Muslim ethnic groups, Christians mingled with other Christians, and Jews with other Jews, and so on. Some groups remained endogamous by their own customs, but many didn't.\n\nFinally, atop that genetic foundation of mostly Anatolian but not-insignificant Turkic ancestry, we have a more recent history of forced assimilation, migration, and Turkification from the late Ottoman era onward. Families of non-Turkish ethnic origin were legally compelled to adopt Turkish names, language, and customs. As Turkish nationalism in that era was a vehemently secular ideology, minorities were *nominally* free to remain, so long as they outwardly adhered to Turkish cultural norms. Obviously, the reality was that those who did not acquiesce were subjected forced population exchanges and genocide--not just Armenians, but also Christian Greeks and Assyrians, and the Kurds who, though majority Muslim, largely resisted assimilation. \n\nThis means that contemporary Turkey is a patchwork of hidden ethnic minorities--people who may not even be aware of relatively recent non-Turkish heritage. Numbers are difficult to gauge, as ethnic identity is not just a matter of ancestry, but also culture, language, and community. (If your great-grandparents were Circassians, but you speak only Turkish, eat Turkish food, socialize with Turkish friends, and consider yourself Turkish, are you still Circassian in a meaningful way?) Most estimates agree that a large portions of the Turkish population are of mixed Turkish (Turkic and native Anatolian), Caucasian, Balkan (esp. Bosniak, Greek, Albanian, and Bulgarian), and Middle Eastern heritage, with much of this mixture happening relatively recently. The genetic heterogeneity of the population suggests that the real ethnogenesis of the contemporary Turkish population is still somewhat underway, and that the Turkish population of today is substantially different, in terms of ethnic and genetic composition, than the Turkish population of 200 years ago.", "created_utc": "1656610099.0", "edited": "False", "id": "iecd6jp", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_voaa36", "parent_id": "t3_voaa36", "score": "10", "subreddit": "AskAnthropology", "subreddit_id": "t5_2wl4u"}, {"author": "frisky_husky", "body": "don't look now but I think that guy's a habsburg", "created_utc": "1656607458.0", "edited": "False", "id": "iec6heh", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_vo0l1r", "parent_id": "t3_vo0l1r", "score": "5", "subreddit": "linguisticshumor", "subreddit_id": "t5_2vwiq"}, {"author": "frisky_husky", "body": "Have you ever seen *The Triplets of Belleville*?", "created_utc": "1656607251.0", "edited": "False", "id": "iec5ykw", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_vo25b7", "parent_id": "t3_vo25b7", "score": "2", "subreddit": "CitiesSkylines", "subreddit_id": "t5_331rj"}, {"author": "frisky_husky", "body": "Jersey. \n\nYou love New York and have complicated but defensive feelings about your home state.

You might also ask why New York, the largest, most diverse, and most culturally powerful city in the US, didn't become a major film hub, despite being the undisputed capital of American theatre. \n\nNew Jersey was supposed to be the film capital of America. Edison Labs was based there, and Thomas Edison had a virtual monopoly on film technology in the early days. Very quickly, though, filmmakers began looking for alternatives to circumvent Edison's control over the industry. Hollywood was the clear victor for two main reason: weather, and land. Movie making is much easier when you have lots of space to work with, and predictable, consistent, moderate weather. \n\nUnlike England, which has four distinct seasons, frequent rain, and frequent fluctuations in weather conditions, LA's weather is incredibly consistent, which makes filming more technically straightforward, but also allows for better on-screen continuity. The LA area is also remarkably geographically diverse, which allows filmmakers to imitate a variety of settings without getting very far outside the city. Famously, a \"Studio Zone\" was negotiated between producers and unions to regulate costs and working conditions, which made filming outside the radius (which today is the thirty-mile zone, or TMZ) more expensive for studios. Fortunately, within the zone you have coasts, huge mountains, deserts, farmland, etc. And land was cheap and plentiful, which allowed movie makers to be more ambitious with scale and scenery. England simply couldn't compete on either front, which is why many renowned British filmmakers set up shop in Hollywood within the first few decades.\n\nFast forward to the post-war era, and Los Angeles is booming economically, and emerges from the war completely unscathed, as does the rest of the United States. The UK, by contrast, emerges economically devastated and scarred by the Blitz. Rationing in the UK lasted nearly a decade after the War, and the British economy didn't really get back on its feet until the late 1950s. Cinema is an expensive and technically demanding medium, so poor economic conditions are generally bad for the film industry. \n\n\"But wait,\" you say, \"what about the post-war film booms in Italy, France, and Japan?\" Well, They differ from the UK in a very simple way: they don't speak English. British moviegoers could watch American movies. Continental European and Japanese filmmakers had to meet domestic demand by working with what resources they had. Fortunately for us, by using those limited resources in incredibly creative ways, they produced some of the greatest and most innovative works in all of cinema; works like *Bicycle Thieves* and *The Seven Samurai.* These films profoundly influenced the next generation of filmmakers. The road from the Studio System of Old Hollywood to the auteurs of New Hollywood--Coppola, Scorsese, et al.--runs through postwar European and Japanese cinema. The anomaly in all this is Stanley Kubrick, an American who spent the most productive part of his career based in the United Kingdom. But Kubrick's films are famous for their highly stylized and choreographed *interior* scenes.\n\nTo summarize, America came to dominate English language cinema precisely because film markets generally break down by language, rather than country. The technical and economic advantages to filming in Hollywood made it appealing for even many British filmmakers. As a result, the money, people, and innovations in postwar English-language cinema were happening in Hollywood, and the films emerging from the UK's film industry were generally more self-consciously \"British\", because that was where the UK had a comparative advantage over the United States, which was by then the cultural and economic hegemon of the English-speaking world.", "created_utc": "1655915325.0", "edited": "False", "id": "idbl7nk", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_vi1t8y", "parent_id": "t3_vi1t8y", "score": "7", "subreddit": "AskHistory", "subreddit_id": "t5_2sa8i"}, {"author": "frisky_husky", "body": "I've got a lot of family in the area and every time I'm up there it seems like the sprawl gets worse, but not much else gets better, just more expensive.

I'm going to try and speak as someone with experience working in municipal government in a city known as a hotbed of this sort of thing (Boston), but also as someone who has lost close relatives to both violence and opioid addiction, and had other loved ones struggle with it as well, who were lucky enough to make it out.\n\nThere's an unhealthy tendency in a lot of progressive pro-urban social environments (the kind that I tend to frequent, at least) to simply try and bury the issue--to chalk it all up to people not being comfortable with the visual reminders of the poverty that exists around them, and preferring to simply shove it somewhere else where they don't have to look. In my experience actually working in the neighborhoods where this is a major issue, and talking to people who are concerned about it, that portrayal (which often comes from people who don't actually *live* in the most severely impacted areas) is simply unfair. \n\nOne hotbed of the crisis is located two blocks from an elementary school. I used to volunteer at that school several times a week. All the students I worked with were black or Hispanic, many with immigrant parents who weren't strangers to neighborhoods far rougher than anything in Boston. Kids were regularly more than an hour late because their parents got stuck in traffic driving them to school, since they didn't feel comfortable letting them walk or take transit, and many were coming in from different parts of the city. These students, I know from being in the classrooms, struggled to keep up. They weren't falling behind because they weren't as smart, or because their social circumstances were dramatically different from many of the other students. They were struggling because they had no safe way to get to school on time. I saw students who arrived at school traumatized because of things they'd seen outside--things that no child that age should have to see. I saw how these things hurt them. I saw caring teachers and parents struggle to deal with the impact of a crisis they couldn't control. They didn't want patch fixes. They didn't want the visual reminders of poverty pushed somewhere else; many of them were struggling with poverty themselves. \n\nThings like this force us to reckon with the fact that victimhood within a deeply flawed society is not simply binary. The people congregating there were suffering, some from addiction alone, more still from underlying physical and mental illnesses, and all from economic and social distress. They'd been beaten, and beaten hard, often by things they could not control. And yet, the harm done did not stop with them. It spilled over into the children, and the families, and the teachers, and the neighbors, and the businesses, and the infrastructure. Many of the more middle class families at the school were from the black community that has thrived in that neighborhood for a century--a neighborhood that has been a hotbed of black art, politics, literature, and activism for generations. Of the parents who could afford to consider moving out of the neighborhood, nearly all were at least considering it. I could tell that even *thinking* about it was heartbreaking for many of them.\n\nAs you noted, it's clear to many of us what needs to be done. Treatment first. Housing first. Public health. Compassion. But what happens when it doesn't materialize? We don't want to stigmatize those who are suffering, but we seem to know, deep down, that this can sometimes lead us to turn a blind eye to suffering itself. \n\nYou, as a parent, should never be expected to put your child in danger to make a political point. You can (and should) raise your daughter in as safe and nurturing an environment as you can give her, while also continuing to fight for the communities you care about in a constructive way. \n\nAs for the problem itself, policy changes alone won't be enough to solve the issue. They will have an impact, but we cannot expect to reason our way out of a drug crisis. Many will come looking for help if you offer it, but many will not. You *cannot* wait for people to hit rock bottom first, because many will not come out alive. The uncomfortable truth is that we need to be prepared to intervene on an individual level when people aren't willing (or, perhaps more often, aren't fully *able*) to seek out help. I'm not talking about throwing drug users in jail, but about addressing treatable issues which cause real, measurable collective harm. I'm not convinced that this can happen meaningfully on a municipal level, because public health issues don't generally respect borders. \n\nDon't let things out of sight be out of mind.

The archipelago is very linguistically diverse, and only about a quarter of the population speaks Tagalog natively, thought it has today become a lingua franca alongside English, and became the national standard as it is the largest individual language. Cebuano, Ilocano, and Hiligaynon are also major regional languages, but more than a quarter of the population speaks a language or dialect amounting to less than 3% of the national total, and historically this proportion would have been larger. Standardized Tagalog and English displaced Spanish as the lingua franca, but Tagalog would have just been another regional language (albeit a large one) at the time.\n\nSecond, something that this generally great response glosses over is the legacy of disease in the social development of Latin America post-colonization. Unlike the indigenous American populations, who had no immunity to \"Old World\" diseases, and had their populations decimated by pandemic, the indigenous population of the Philippines has always been in contact with Mainland Asia through trade and migration. This meant that the diseases which ravaged the native population of the Americas were already present in maritime Southeast Asia. Spanish displaced the native languages of Latin America largely because huge swaths of the population died, and what remained was absorbed into the Hispanic-dominated *mestizo* cultures that dominate many Latin American countries today, some of which also incorporated significant African influences due to the slave trade. In Mexico and much of Central and South America, the dominant culture largely reflects an indigenous maternal heritage, and a European paternal heritage, in varying amounts by region and family. That is to say, the aspects of culture and society that were historically dominated by women--cuisine, clothing, domestic handicrafts, et cetera--often reflect a stronger indigenous inheritance, while the aspects of culture historically dominated by men--religion, politics, formal education, business, and the family structure itself--reflect European norms. Spanish men were encouraged to take indigenous wives, with the expectation that children would be raised Catholic and Spanish. While this happened in the Philippines as well, and a large portion of the Filipino elite has some Spanish ancestry, the fact that the native population remained largely intact meant that the overall proportion of the population was much smaller.\n\nInterestingly, the Phillipines were administered as a part of Mexico until 1821. Galleons ran regularly between Manila and Acapulco. Genetic testing suggests that a large portion of the Mexican population (especially in the state of Guerrero) has significant Southeast Asian ancestry. Conversely, the number of Peruvians and Mexicans (largely indigenous and *mestizo*) settling in the Philippines was orders of magnitude higher than the number of Spaniards.

Spices and how you treat them. Whole spices gently infused into fat at the start of cooking. Seemingly-trivial amounts of bass note flavors like star anise, cardamom, clove, and bay leaf that won't hit you over the head, but you notice when they're gone, or worse, burnt. Freshly ground and powdered spices added a bit later in the cooking process so as to not cook out the fresher and more delicate aromas. \n\n2.) Control of heat. As a primarily western cook my first instinct is to brown things. And browning certainly plays a valuable role in South Asian cooking. But it's equally important in to know when to cook things slowly over very low heat, so that the flavor of maillard browning doesn't drown out more complex flavors. We tend to think of browning = complexity, but that's not necessarily the case. It brings out certain elements, but also tends to make different ingredients taste more similar. If you want complex flavor in something like a curry, knowing when to brown and when not to is paramount. I made a vegetarian biryani last night that started with a base of shallots browned until they almost went crispy, but the rest of the vegetables are just sweated. The shallots are giving you that delicious roasty flavor base, which allows other ingredients to keep their flavor through more gentle cooking.\n\nIn something like a korma (a 'dish' which my Indian friends tell me has as many recipes as there are Indian moms), you might do the exact opposite. A lot of recipes have you painstakingly sweat onions over a basically nonexistent heat until they break down completely, but without developing any caramelization. The flavor is totally different from a caramelized onion. You still get the sweetness and richness of slow cooked onion, but it's more fragrant, and doesn't have that deep caramelized flavor that tends to overwhelm delicate spices.\n\nAgain, just things I picked up through trial and error when making Indian recipes as a non-Indian.

While this has been constructed into an ethnic caricature abroad, it\u2019s true that horizontally striped shirts have been hugely popular in France and abroad for over a century now.\n\nThis style of shirt almost certainly obtained prominence through the 1858 reform of the French Navy\u2019s uniforms. This reform made a cotton shirt with 21 horizontal stripes in navy blue the standard garment for French sailors, at least those based in Northern France. It\u2019s possible that some ancestor of this shirt was common among fishermen in this region, as the stripes supposedly make it easier to identify a person who has fallen overboard. \n\nFast forward to the early 20th century, and the marini\u00e8re is well-established as an iconic piece of French military attire. From there, it was more widely adopted by civilians, and became particularly associated with the Breton people, who made up a large portion of the French Navy, hence the common English term \u201cBreton shirt\u201d. At the time, the beach towns of Northern France were popular holiday destinations for affluent Parisians. It was fashionable (as in many beach resorts) to emulate the coastal attire of the locals, which of course included striped nautical shirts. Coco Chanel probably played a significant role in popularizing the garment, originally worn chiefly by male sailors, among women. Anyone traveling to France was likely to see at least a few.\n\nFast forward to the mid 20th century, and the garment becomes associated with another iconic aspect of French culture\u2014the mime. Contrary to what people unfamiliar with the art form assume, miming is an ancient and varied form of physical theater that evolved in its modern French form out of the Italian commedia dell\u2019arte and traditional Japanese theatre. Mimes are *not* French clowns. This misconception emerged because, nine times out of ten, when people think of a mime, they are thinking of Marcel Marceau, arguably the person who is singularly associated with the art form in the public imagination. The outfit associated with the mime in the popular imagination (black pants, striped shirt, hat) is not an outfit traditionally worn by all mime performers, but the costume of Marceau\u2019s signature character, Bip the Clown, who wore a marini\u00e8re. Marceau\u2019s stage persona was so widely viewed, imitated (especially for tourists), and parodied, that the image of a silent clown (perhaps on a bike with a baguette in the basket) wearing a Breton shirt became an iconic symbol of France. \n\nSo, the nautically striped shirt likely acquired its quintessentially French image through a combination of its iconic status *within* France as a classic piece of coastal attire, and it\u2019s association with Marcel Marceau, *the* embodiment of a major piece of French cultural heritage throughout the world.\n\nSources: \n\nfor the history of the garment, this article from the UK National Maritime Museum provides a good summary: https://www.rmg.co.uk/stories/blog/stripes-sea-history-breton-top\n\nEDIT: Very surprised by the amount of love this is getting, as things like this aren't usually my strong suit!

Without going into what historical materialism actually entails, and how Marx believes it operates, capitalism is the logical consequence of humanity's historical economic development *up until the present*. Marx rejects the premise that capitalism is the final state of human economic organization, or that human behavior under capitalism represents fundamental human nature, but he does believe that historical path dependency makes capitalism an inevitable stage in human economic development. \n\nMarx *emphatically did not* believe that you could have a communist society without first having a capitalist one. Communism is down the road from capitalism, because you do not cannot develop the conditions for communism (as understood through historical materialism) without the capitalist development of productive capacity. Marx was, honestly, really impressed by capitalism's ability to produce large volumes of relatively complicated products. Marx witnessed the latter part of the industrial revolution, which was marked by a sharp divergence in per capita productivity over preindustrial levels. Humanity was now not just making more stuff because there were more people around to make stuff, we were making more stuff because the development of industrial processes to replace artisanal processes made production vastly more efficient.\n\n It's hard to overstate just how dramatic a departure this was from how human economies had functioned before. Marx was awestruck by the ability of industrial manufacturing to produce such vast quantities of material goods that industrial powers had to go conquering new markets (and new resources) to keep feeding the beast. But he also saw that the workers who labored in these factories often couldn't afford the products that they made, and the value of their labor was being extracted by the capitalists who controlled the means of production. Unlike artisans, who were paid for the value of the labor that went into making their products, factory workers were paid a fixed wage, and the value of their immense productivity went into the pockets of the owners. Marx's inquiry basically begins with a probe into the disconnect between the wages of workers and the value of their labor, and then moves to reckon with the question of how different structures of control might harness the productive potential of industry, while ensuring that workers benefit from the absolute value of their labor. \n\nSo, whether or not you think he was *correct*, Marx was critical of capitalism's (he believes) inherent dependence upon exploited workers, but also understood capitalism as only one stage in history, and one which was necessarily endured in order to develop the social and economic conditions for communism.", "created_utc": "1652154194.0", "edited": "False", "id": "i80btdt", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_ulwstk", "parent_id": "t3_ulwstk", "score": "3", "subreddit": "askphilosophy", "subreddit_id": "t5_2sc5r"}, {"author": "frisky_husky", "body": "That's super useful, I will absolutely check that out!

Part of the challenge I've found in reading OE (and I am by *no means* an expert, or even proficient in this) is not that the cognates don't *exist* in Modern English, but that they've undergone semantic drift or have fallen out of favor and now seem archaic. Reading Middle English, EME, and dialectical English (if you can find it written down), plus older works in Scots definitely helps build a vocabulary of less common Germanic-derived vocabulary and now-archaic inflections that will make it much easier to discern meanings in OE. There was a second big influx of Romance vocabulary and (especially) Romance grammar starting in the Renaissance and reaching an apex in the 17th and 18th centuries. You start to see educational texts explicitly attempting to make English speakers write English more like Latin. The older you go, the more of this you avoid. That said, I'd avoid baby-stepping your way backwards. I think it's worthwhile to broaden the diversity of dialects, but the difference between Chaucer and Shakespeare, say, isn't so vast that you need to account for every inch of it. \n\nUnderstanding pronunciation shifts also helped me. Maybe this is weird, but I think that reading Modern English with a pre-vowel shift accent (or as close to one as I can muster, which quickly turns Swedish Chef) helped me pick out cognates.

There were old aristocratic cohorts of Spanish descent in Louisiana, Texas, California, and the Southwest.

Where they were concentrated, they were understood as a creole elite in the same way those of English descent were elsewhere. Hispanics of European descent (and looking the part) were generally accepted as white, and \"Hispanic or Latino\" as a separate ethno-racial category didn't really exist yet.

Those from the working classes certainly faced discrimination, as they were Southern European Catholics whose social and economic values differed somewhat from the Anglo-Protestant mainstream.

It's incredibly difficult to measure \"pure\" (such as it is) descent in the United States because of the way we survey ethnicity, but the most recent available data suggests that the median household income for self-identified Spanish-Americans is slightly higher than the median for white people writ large. That suggests that, at least economically, they're doing exactly as well as you'd expect for someone of European descent, and are likely reaching similar levels of educational and professional attainment.\n\nTl;dr, yes, of course those of European Iberian descent faced a degree of discrimination shared by other so-called \"White Ethnics\", but *always* less than those of Afro-Hispanic or Mestizo descent, and without some of the deeper cross-generational economic consequences.

I think there's such a thing as a \"bad orthography\", but not necessarily a \"best orthography\". A bad orthography would be one that doesn't clearly express features which are basically universal in the language, or indicates a pronunciation that isn't used by any dialect. I think Gaelic orthography is confusing to learn, especially since nearly everybody approaches it from an English-speaking frame of reference, but it does a pretty good job of marking internally consistent features. What it doesn't always tell you is *how* those features are reflected in a given dialect, but it indicates that they are happening. \n\nI'd argue that having a standardized dialect is usually a good thing overall for many vulnerable languages, because it lowers the barriers of entry, and allows the language to serve its social function in a world where people don't stay in the towns where they were born. Obviously it's a double-edged sword, but standardized Basque, for example, has made the creation of a very successful Basque-medium education system easier post-Franco. This resulted in a *dramatic* reversal of Basque's decline within the space of only a few decades. Of course, you lose some of the culture preserved in local variations, but getting people to actually *use* a declining language makes it much more likely for these to be saved than having people learn a dialect they can only use to talk to their grandparents.\n\nI think a good orthography is one that can adapt to local variations without changing the fundamental rules of the system. English, for all the shit it gets, does pretty well at this.

African Americans, as some have pointed out, lost their foreign heritage to a degree unlike any other racial group in America. They were forcibly Christianized, forced to adapt to European systems of social organization and production, and, largely through the rape of enslaved women, forcibly intermixed with the Euro-American population. \n\nGerman Americans, too, didn't have much agency in their loss of identity. Prior to World War I, Germans were much more visibly outside the American mainstream. German-speakers of foreign birth *alone* counted about 3% of the U.S. population in 1910, and that's not counting the large German American communities that already existed, and were writing, doing business, teaching their children, and holding church services in the German language. It's hard to say (because we don't have the data) what percentage of the U.S. population spoke German natively, but before the war, the German language was the the United States what Spanish is today--a ubiquitous and widely studied minority language, with its own media, cultural, and religious infrastructure. World War I was devastating for German identity, and there was a frenzy of anti-German sentiment. Government support for German-speaking communities (especially their schools) basically ceased overnight, and many German families very rapidly erased anything that publicly suggested a cultural affinity with the enemy. By and large, only the most traditional of the ethnic German communities, Volga Germans from Russia and the (significantly Anabaptist) Pennsylvania Dutch, who were well-established, partially escaped with their identities intact.\n\nFrench Americans are a particularly interesting case to me, because all things considered, they really *did* assimilate more readily than other non-Anglo groups. Part of this is due to the tendency of French Americans to associate more readily with a 'New World' identity, such as the Cajuns of Louisiana, or the French Canadians and Acadians of New England. The portion of immigrants coming directly from France was small and early, so most Americans of French descent have deep roots on this continent. Those who didn't arrive indirectly through the French colonies were largely protestant Huguenots, and they tended to cluster with other reformed protestant groups, especially the Dutch, as many Huguenots had fled persecution in the Netherlands. In the Hudson Valley, where I grew up, there was no divide between the old Dutch families and the old Huguenot families. Later arrivals were often involved in commerce, and assimilated into the elite, aided by a general reverence for things French. Basically, the French from France were disproportionately small in number, protestant by faith, liberal by conviction, and more often high in status, which allowed them to slip into the Anglo-American mainstream relatively unnoticed, and intermarry accordingly.", "created_utc": "1646326663.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hz7bl72", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_t5pzqg", "parent_id": "t3_t5pzqg", "score": "15", "subreddit": "AskHistory", "subreddit_id": "t5_2sa8i"}, {"author": "frisky_husky", "body": "We know ***way less*** about pre-Christian Norse religion than pop culture would lead you to believe.

It's likely that there were people who were religiously apathetic, but without knowing more about what these communities actually believed and practiced, it's incredibly difficult to say whether anyone had deep philosophical objections to the notion of religion itself, a notion which depends strongly on how you define a religion. From an Abrahamic point of view, it's easy to say 'well, you either believe in one almighty god, or you don't.' You're either religious, or you aren't. But in a culture that doesn't adhere to that understanding of religiosity, or doesn't have anything ready to assume the epistemic place of religion in their worldview, can you extract yourself from a fundamentally religious view of the world at all?

People who get into PhD programs because they don't know what else to do generally aren't happy in them, and wind up wasting a lot of time and (potentially) money on a degree they won't finish.\n\nIf you are looking at a PhD because you know that you're interested in research or teaching in a general field, but feel uncertain because you think you need to know exactly what you want to do, then I think it's worth strongly considering. The social sciences are a lot more amorphous than other areas of study. I've worked with STEM PhDs who will likely spend their lives as experts on one super specific kind of research, because they've spent years mastering incredibly advanced processes. I've worked with social science PhDs who thought they knew exactly what they wanted to study, only to find that there wasn't much more there for them to learn. The successful ones can absorb that kind of blow without the rug being pulled out under them, because their interests were broader than that in the first place.\n\nI can't tell you which is the case for you, and I can't tell you how to solve a problem as personal as this.

Let me explain:\n\nThe most \"different\" languages from basically any given European language that your average person might attempt to learn are probably Korean and Japanese. Unscientific take, I know, but I think it broadly holds up. Japan and Korea are highly developed, technologically advanced, Western-aligned media superpowers. Japanese pop culture has been huge abroad for a few decades now, and Korean film, TV, and music has gotten HUGE outside South Korea very quickly, at least here in the US and Canada (I assume this is true in other Western countries).\n\nI don't want to delve too deeply into the politics of the region, or the many banal ways that anti-Chinese racism manifests itself in Western societies, but Taiwan has all the ingredients to be a cultural superpower. It's a more \"approachable\" country for Westerners than the PRC. It's a more liberal society that doesn't censor its most appealing artists. It has a large and globally mobile middle class, and many large companies which are more familiar to Western consumers than Mainland Chinese companies. Basically, as a wealthier and more liberal society, Taiwan commands more prestige abroad. Its peers are the other highly developed East Asian democracies: Japan and South Korea. Taiwanese media has started to get more attention abroad, but hasn't quite reached a critical mass.\n\nNow, I don't think this means that Chinese will reach the status of a global lingua franca equivalent to English. I think that was always a tough sell, due to a very complicated writing system (often even for native speakers) and a structure that is often challenging for western learners. It remains true that the main second language in basically every wealthy country is English, and Chinese will not displace English as long as economic, social, and political prestige remains firmly planted in Europe and North America. Even if the PRC rises to a position commensurate with its population, it is still just one country. Many countries in its cultural orbit have long since aligned themselves with the West *against* Mainland Chinese influence, and I don't really see this changing unless the Chinese political and economic order undergoes fundamental change. The challenge Taiwan faces is that it is simply not large enough to translate its more \"palatable\" cultural position into a more dominant stature than any other developed country of a similar size, like the Netherlands. But soft power matters, and I know a surprising number of people who have tried learning Dutch because they think Amsterdam seems nice. And Chinese has about a billion more speakers.\n\nTl;dr: I think that Taiwanese cultural appeal could convince Westerners to dabble in Chinese again, but few will probably reach anything close to fluency, and I don't think that most will be doing so with the expectation that Chinese will be displacing English anytime soon.", "created_utc": "1640365357.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hptqbv7", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_rn7dbl", "parent_id": "t3_rn7dbl", "score": "5", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "frisky_husky", "body": "I think this is a really underappreciated point.

I think it's a generally good overview of the shortcomings in Anderson's version of modular politics, and is more of a corollary than a critique--she generally agrees with Anderson. Goswami argues that Anderson treats the process of ideological diffusion as congruent with ideological adoption, and doesn't go far enough in assessing the social and historical path dependencies which cause nationalism to take root. She also contests the single origin of nationalism. Generally a good read from a good scholar.\n\nOther recommendations, either scholars or useful works:\n\n\\- Ronald Niezen on indigenism. I like his definitions, and he's a good source on what indigenism aims to do, but I disagree with how he situates it vis-a-vis nationalism.\n\n\\- *Power in Movement: Social Movements and Contentious Politics* by Sidney Tarrow.

I don't agree with every point of it, but I think it takes a necessary look at how political and ideological constructs like nationalism and colonialism create and compel forms of collective expression which cannot be fully conceptualized outside these ideological paradigms, with a specific look at indigeneity.

It's not that the other students didn't care about classes or share similar goals--socially I really enjoyed my time at Northeastern, but I went in pursuing a very skills-based field, and wound up transferring into the humanities with the ultimate goal of going into research or academia. If I had gone in knowing this, I probably would have wound up at a liberal arts college or a more \"traditional\" research university. I'm glad I didn't, but I do often think about what could have been, and I don't necessarily think that seeking that out would be the wrong choice for someone in a similar boat.\n\nTo be honest, I think there just wasn't a lot around for people with those goals, especially in CSSH, where opportunities to TA and help on research tend to be reserved for grad students. I liked most of my professors, and I don't think the teaching was lacking, but there wasn't much to back it up for students who are more academically driven than career driven. I tried to seek those opportunities out, but between classes and co-op, there were more hurdles than I really had the time or mental energy to jump. I know people who studied similar subjects in more \"traditional\" settings, and their experiences were pretty different from mine. Trying to find a more research focused job in my field that will make a good stepping stone has been difficult, because the co-op model doesn't necessarily align with the expected trajectory of \"internship, to undergrad research assistant, to TA.\" Most of those were simply off the table for me. I couldn't afford to take an unpaid internship, or to accept a lower-paying/abroad co-op that would align better with my goals. I asked my professors and my department about TA opportunities every semester, but nothing ever materialized. In contrast, my friends in CoS and Khoury had plenty of opportunities to do both.\n\nI think Northeastern has a lot of strengths, especially if you're in a discipline where real-world experience is the best source of education. In my experience, most people are highly driven, and genuinely passionate about something. There's a culture of work ethic that I really admired. My CS and engineering friends generally loved their co-ops, and felt that they learned a lot from them. I liked my co-op employers, but it felt like dead time when I wasn't really *learning* anything, and by about two months in I was excited to get back to classes.\n\nWait and see how you feel after you're done with NUin, because the consensus seems to be that it's very different, and I hope you'll find your stride.

Popular sentiment in Austria had been in favor of union with Germany at least since the fall of the Habsburg monarchy. Austria felt vulnerable without its empire, and unification with the much larger Germany would have provided stability and security in the minds of many. The main sources of political opposition were Austria\u2019s own fascist leaders, who modeled their state more closely after Italian Fascism, with a strong emphasis on the central role of Catholicism in society, though the absence of a strong racial doctrine also made the nationalist-corporatist-conservative Austro-fascist ideology appealing to many middle and upper class Austrian Jews. Nevertheless, the vast majority had never stopped thinking of themselves as Germans (remember it had only been 15 years since 1918 when Hitler, an Austrian, took power in Germany), and therefore their inclusion in a German nation-state seemed to make sense. Support for unification had transcended political lines- not only Nazi sympathizers favored the union.\n\nThe idea that Austria was not broadly complicit in the Anschluss took root strongly after the war, when Austria sought to obscure its own role in the Nazi atrocities by reconceptualizing its sovereignty as the first domino to fall to Nazism. This was, simply, false. The Anschluss happened quickly and with minimal resistance. That is not to say that there were not many Austrians who fully and sincerely opposed Nazism, but even many of those who disagreed with the Nazis politically (including Social Democrats like Karl Renner) accepted the unification, and continued about their lives.   Meanwhile, Austrians were welcomed into the Nazi state apparatus, and led many of the most brutal atrocities against the and Roma communities. The *absolute majority* of commanders charged with carrying out the Nazis\u2019 genocides were Austrian. Negotiating the disturbing truth of Austrian enablement of Nazi atrocities was a difficult proposition in Post-war Austria, especially with a new adversary just across the border from Vienna, and so they simply put it off, and embraced a sort of national myth of Austrian victimhood as a convenient political tack to unite the country against the Soviets, and keep it firmly aligned with the West, if technically neutral. It wasn\u2019t until the post-Soviet, or at least post-Waldheim, era that Austria really began to grapple with its own culpability in any substantive way, but most observers I\u2019ve read still agree that Austria has not wrestled with its role as fully or sincerely as Germany has.", "created_utc": "1632422304.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hdzusb4", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_pu10o0", "parent_id": "t3_pu10o0", "score": "5", "subreddit": "AskHistory", "subreddit_id": "t5_2sa8i"}, {"author": "frisky_husky", "body": "How could I forget the pig war!!

Maybe my experience was unusual, but I found that the transition was a lot easier than I expected it to be. Part of this could be because I was moving from a third story walk-up to a row house with a small backyard, so I was a little bit more at ease, but he's settled in pretty well, and I think it goes to show how adaptable puppies can be.\n\nMy first pointer would be to insulate your dog from your own stress. Moving isn't easy, especially when you're living in the flux of moving from one place, to a temporary place, to a long-term place. You're both going to be under a lot of stress, and your dog will sense this. Pace yourself, take breaks, and make sure that the stress you're under isn't carrying over to your puppy. Moving actually helped me to see the time I spent with my puppy as a break from the other stresses in my life. Being able to take a walk, decompress, and gather my thoughts really helped my mental health throughout the process.\n\nMy second pointer would be to use the fact that you're moving twice to your advantage. It's not about \"home\". Dogs don't care about the physical surroundings the way we do. It's an opportunity to teach your puppy that \"home\" is where *you* are, and to help your puppy learn to adapt to new environments. To do this, you need to show them that their life doesn't change radically even when their surroundings do.\n\nI moved with my puppy from my parents house in the suburbs, where I'd been staying since I got him while he got his shots, and did some crate training and housebreaking. When he was about 4 months, I took him back to my apartment in the city. A month after that, we moved to a new place in the same city. The first day in all these places was overwhelming for both of us, especially his first day as a city dog. He was too distracted to go potty, overwhelmed by the people, dogs, and cars, and my apartment hadn't really been puppy-proofed, because I hadn't been living in it, and was subletting to my sister. I went out of my way to make the second day exciting. I took some time away from the unpacking, loaded him in the car, and brought him to the really nice dog park first thing in the morning. I wanted to show him that even though the surroundings changed, we could still do fun things. It also helped to burn off enough mental and physical energy that he could settle down and sleep in the new place while I got some things organized. \n\nI expected him to regress on crate training, house training, and all that. It didn't really materialize. Maybe I just got lucky, but I found that by letting him know that even though he's in a different house, the same house rules still apply. If *you* keep looking forward, and don't prime your dog to regress, then it's less likely that your dog will see the move as a disruption in his routine. Make sure that the crate feels the same, and the puppy might learn to see it as a constant amidst the change, which is what I think happened for mine.\n\nFinally, I'd say invest in a playpen if you don't already have one, and spend a bit of time teaching him to be in it. That made a world of difference when I was actually making the move. I didn't have to worry about him getting into things that weren't usually sitting out, chewing on boxes, etc. It helped me relax a lot.", "created_utc": "1631812786.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hd3oy6t", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_ppgq19", "parent_id": "t3_ppgq19", "score": "3", "subreddit": "puppy101", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rw7o"}, {"author": "frisky_husky", "body": "Not sure how this is...easier than just frying the egg...\n\nAlso, probably wouldn't work.

In most of Europe this practice never really caught on, since the climate wasn't necessarily prohibitive to butter consumption. Lard, by contrast, is pure fat. This makes it stable without refrigeration, ideal for hot climates like Mexico and the American South. Olive oil is more stable than butter, but goes rancid relatively quickly.\n\nCooking food in fat was a practice introduced to the Americas by the Spanish, alongside pork and other fatty Old World livestock. Indigenous Mexicans did not have metal cookware, and crockery is more suited to \"low and slow\" cooking than frying.

The Arabic-based Persian writing system spread within the Persian sphere of influence, which under the Muslim-ruled Mughal Empire, came to include most of India.

Take Tajik, which as a Persian dialect was historically written in Perso-Arabic script, before being romanized during the USSR's flirtation with the Latin script, and then written in Cyrillic, a script developed for only distantly related Slavic languages.

Especially among the upper classes, there were many Orthodox families of Turkic (particularly Tatar) origin that had intermarried with Slavic nobility. There are Tatars/Chuvashes/Uzbeks, etc. that look completely European, some who look completely Asian, and many who fall somewhere in between. Racial constructs look different when it's a sliding scale rather than a hard barrier, and the nature of a land-based empire makes this particularly relevant in Russia's case. Unlike their British/French/Spanish counterparts, Russia's empire was contiguous. They weren't (with a few exceptions) landing on the other side of an ocean, where the racial difference is clear and obvious.\n\nAll that said, just because a racial boundaries is conceptualized differently doesn't mean that racial biases were nonexistent. There was a *very* pronounced Slavic and Christian cultural chauvinism in Imperial Russia, and the desire to impose Russian civilization on non-Russians was very much rooted in a paternalistic imperial mindset. (Though, oddly, Russia didn't really bother converting Muslims, perhaps for political reasons.) Slavic cultures were best, and Russian culture was the best Slavic culture. Russia actually hoped to lure Slavic migrants in the US and Canada to Siberia with the promise of land and opportunity within a Slavic society, but Ukrainian, Slovak, Czech, and Polish immigrants were not very *eager* to resettle in Russia, which had put quite a bit of effort into smothering their distinct cultures whenever it had the opportunity. In Russia, pan-Slavism and Russian cultural imperialism were usually one and the same. Russia firmly asserted *cultural* superiority. The imperial doctrine was *Orthodoxy, Autocracy, and Nationality*, with nationality signifying deference to \"Great Russian\" authority.\n\nAs for your adoption question, I don't know any specific anecdotes to make an argument one way or the other. If the child was brought up in a settled Slavic home, in the Orthodox faith, and completely internalized Slavic culture, and married into a Slavic family, then *maybe* they'd be seen as a sort of edge-case Russian (perhaps more fully in a Cossack community).\n\nBasically, compare Russia more closely to the 'civilizing' approach applied to indigenous peoples in the US, Canada, Australia, etc. Russia's conquest of the East has a lot more in common with America's conquest of the West than with sea-based European imperialism. Indigenous (largely nomadic) peoples were seen basically as noble savages who could be civilized if they abandoned their communities and cultural heritage. Chinese, Manchus, and their ilk were much more clearly *others*, belonging to a foreign civilization, rather than a perceived *lack* of civilization.\n\nTl;dr: Russia's ethnic and political geography made racial boundaries blurry.

Parts of Heilongjiang are flat, and some are mountainous, but the plains lead all the way to the sea, and are accessible from the rest of Eastern China, the population hub of the entire country. Even today, the Russian Far East is much, **much,** ***much*** harder to get to from Western Russia, where most of the people live. But still, there are cities there, and they exist for a reason, and it's a pretty interesting story.\n\nBy the end of the 18th century, Russia claimed sovereignty over territory extending from present-day Poland in the west to the Bering Strait in the east, and had established trading colonies in Alaska. However, in the eastern part of this vast periphery, imperial control was superficial at best, if not completely imaginary. As the historian Steven Marks described it, the eastern fringe of the Russian Empire was a \u201cweak and distant domain.\u201d\n\nWestern Siberia, just beyond the Urals, is relatively fertile and was settled by Russians quite early. In the east, there were the cities of Petropavlovsk and Yakutsk, which were accessible by water, but basically impossible to reach by land. Seriously, it's difficult to overstate just how hard it was to cross Eastern Siberia by land. You can follow steppes and valleys as far as Lake Baikal, but beyond that it's rugged mountains all the way to the Pacific. The Russian Empire sent Cossacks to the Far East in an attempt to subdue the small indigenous population and farm the land, but in such a forbidding environment it proved incredibly difficult to do both.\n\nBy the mid-19th century, China and Japan had opened to trade, and the California Gold Rush had shifted the gravity of the global economy to the Pacific Rim. Russia desperately wanted in. With the formal acquisition of the Amur region from China, the economic future of the Russian Empire was expected to take shape in the Far East, and integrating the region became a priority, especially since many Russian elites feared that a distinct settler mentality would take root in the \"Wild East.\" The Trans-Siberian Railway was conceived as much as a political necessity as an economic one. Strong links between East and West would prevent separatist stirrings, and allow the flow of people, power, and products from Europe to the Pacific Rim.\n\nModern Helongjiang itself grew up largely as an extension of this project. After China lost the Amur region to Russia, Han Chinese were allowed to migrate *en masse* into the sparsely populated and Manchu-dominated borderlands. The mentality was the same--populate the region with the dominant ethnic group to reinforce the territorial integrity of the empire. But for Han Chinese, the journey was much shorter and easier than the journey from European Russia to Siberia, and arable land was much easier to come by. Quickly, Helongjiang became the breadbasket of East Asia, and became a major exporter of food to the rest of the region.\n\nChina's imperial neighbors, Russia and Japan, took note, and began to see Manchuria as quite lucrative. The modern city of Harbin grew up around a Russian-built railroad linking the Russian port of Vladivostok (the planned terminus of the Trans-Siberian Railway) with Beijing, and was originally built and populated mainly by Russians. Harbin was an incredibly cosmopolitan city, and functioned as a *de facto* Russian colony in Manchuria, even after Russia's defeat in the Russo-Japanese War led to the loss of its railroads and footholds in Southern Manchuria.\n\nThe Russian Revolution slowed Russia's commercial ambitions in the Far East, but a massive wave of Russian \u00e9migr\u00e9s arrived in Harbin. After the Japanese conquest, Manchuria was aggressively industrialized. After World War II, Manchuria became the power center of the Chinese Communist Party, and was rewarded with attention from Beijing, which focused many early industrialization efforts on the region, due in part to its proximity to communist China's then-ally, the USSR. The bulk of Helongjiang's explosion in population took place during the postwar period of industrialization.\n\nBasically, Russia tried in the 1800s and early 1900s to do what China came to do in Manchuria later on, but geography and a relative lack of arable land made the Russian Far East a pretty unattractive destination for migrants. The relative proximity of Helongjiang to major Han population centers made for easier access, and better land made it easier to settle down. But the biggest divergence happened in the 20th century. The most economically important Russian settlement in the region was Harbin, which was actually in China. But the biggest difference is that, for Russia, populating the region simply ceased to be a priority, whereas in China the political and industrial weight which had accrued in the region, largely as a result of decades of quite brutal colonization, made it an attractive destination for post-war internal migration.\n\nSOURCES:\n\nSteven Marks, *Road To Power: The Trans-Siberian Railroad and the Colonization of Asian Russia* (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1991).\n\n*Imperial Visions: Nationalist Imagination and Geographical Expansion in the Russian Far East 1840-1865* (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1999).\n\nMariko Tamanoi, *Crossed Histories: Manchuria in the Age of Empire* (Honolulu: University of Hawai'i Press, 2005).\n\nEDIT: Thanks for the silver :D", "created_utc": "1625335855.0", "edited": "1625372570.0", "id": "h3xyb61", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_ocx1w3", "parent_id": "t3_ocx1w3", "score": "531", "subreddit": "AskHistorians", "subreddit_id": "t5_2ssp3"}, {"author": "frisky_husky", "body": "You can with French for sure.

Originally, any liquid obtained through distillation was considered *aqua vitae*, as it was believed to carry the \"spirit\" or \"life essence\" of the substance from which it was being distilled, hence why that category is also known as spirits, and many languages still refer to certain kinds of distillates as \"essences\". It was also extremely medicinally useful, and the (real and imagined) medical benefits are almost certainly part of why the allusion to life became common.\n\nConsumption was encouraged because it was believed that alcohol prevented disease and preserved life forces. Given distilled alcohol's disinfecting properties, this may have been true in places where clean drinking water was harder to come by, but the scarcity of clean drinking water in Europe during this period is *vastly* overestimated, especially with regards to its impact on alcohol consumption habit. Beer, for example, approached its modern form *after* distillation. The alcohol content of the proto-beer consumed by Europeans prior to the Renaissance was not high enough to effectively kill off waterborne microbes. Beer was chiefly an effective way of storing and consuming *grain*, rather than a way of storing and consuming *water*. You need clean water to make beer, and that was generally not too difficult to come by in pre-modern Europe, or even elsewhere. The fact that \"bread and water\" is referenced in the Bible as the generic meal of ordinary people suggests that even in the Middle East it was still the default beverage.\n\nThe term \"vodka\" probably originated in Poland and later spread to other Slavic lands, but it comes from the same root meaning, which probably arrived via Latin texts from elsewhere in Europe. The \"little water\" is the purified extract of whatever substance is being distilled, which is dramatically reduced in volume through the distillation process. Distillation is a very old process, but distilling a safely potable beverage is not easy. Because commercial-scale distillation processes largely developed in Europe (although it's incredibly likely that other cultures, especially in Asia, had developed similar processes independently), many languages use the terminology introduced by Europeans.\n\nEDIT: I will say that the one advantage of beer brewing is that it does make it easier to tell if your water is unsafe to drink, but by nearly all accounts it was brewed and consumed mainly as a source of nutrition.", "created_utc": "1623355308.0", "edited": "1623355873.0", "id": "h1bk3px", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_nwrdi6", "parent_id": "t3_nwrdi6", "score": "64", "subreddit": "AskFoodHistorians", "subreddit_id": "t5_2w1a8"}, {"author": "frisky_husky", "body": "I would potentially be interested.

There have also been plenty of wars of imperialism where colonial powers competed with each other for control over a native population which didn't want either of them, as in the Boer Wars.\n\nThe Russian Civil War is a pretty strong case. You had the Bolsheviks, literally dozens of leftist groups in varying degrees of alliance or conflict with each other, and the White Russians, with the support of most of the great powers. At the same time, you had breakaway parts of the collapsing Russian Empire asserting independence, like Finland, the Baltics, Poland, etc. They were getting a lot of support from the Central Powers, who had a clear incentive in placating the Eastern Front. Plenty of civil wars with larger geopolitical implications broke down similarly. During the Chinese Civil War, the Nationalist and Communist factions fought each other, while also fighting against Japanese incursion.\n\nI sense you're asking about inter-state war between great powers, however. This depends on how you define the \"sides\" in a war, and how you delineate conflicts. In that case the answer is almost certainly yes, but you're going to have a tough time getting everybody to agree on what counts. There's lots of wars where various parties entered a conflict for their own reasons, and may have found themselves in informal alliances of convenience, each with their own long term interest in mind.

Stone construction and ornamentation is immensely heavy, as are the massive stained-glass windows which adorn many of these structures, often within carved stone casings. Medieval master builders studied the successes of classical builders, and the innovations of neighboring architectural traditions like Byzantine and Arab architecture, and carefully adapted their techniques to great success. The adoption of the pointed arch, including pointed transverse arches used in rib vaults, allowed medieval builders to build higher, and to design vertically. Rounded arches require very thing and sturdy walls, because the weight is directed straight down. With pointed arches, the weight can be directed outwards, onto thinner columns and flying buttresses, which allows for larger windows and less mass in the wall itself.

His argument is that classical music is not a style, but a culturally-delineated body of work. Film scores, as a kind of program music, often fit *stylistically* within this paradigm, but haven't entirely been accepted as equivalent in stature to other kinds of major work by the gatekeepers of the classical canon, which has often held something of a bias against music that is seen as insufficiently \"pure\", i.e. created for its own sake as a self-contained work. Film scores *can* cross over into the realm of classical music, but the often populist nature of their appeal often casts film scores as lowbrow in the eyes of the musical establishment, and are confined to the amorphous category of \"the pops\".\n\nCertainly individual scores have made their ways into the classical canon. Prokofiev's score to Eisenstein's *Alexander Nevsky* is (in my opinion) one of his finest works, and is often performed as a stand-alone piece. Many of Bernstein's works blur the line between program music and the classical canon, but of course they had a leg up, as the composer was also the most famous classical conductor of his generation. Likewise for scores by Copland, Corigliano, Glass (the Qatsi trilogy comes to mind), Vaughan Williams (*Sinfonia Antarctica*), Menotti, Khachaturian, you get the idea. The big point here is that the composers who successfully bridge the gap between film score and the classical canon are generally those who have established themselves as palatable to the classical establishment. They're classical composers who dabbled in film, not \"film composers\" that have been admitted into the classical canon. In a lot of cases, the films that these scores come from aren't particularly exceptional, save for the music. \n\nGaining acceptance into the classical canon during your lifetime isn't easy. You have to be innovative, but not *too* innovative. Film music, especially outside the realm of art cinema, is often conservative by nature, as it has to appeal to a mass audience who didn't go to the movies to listen to the score. Music is expected to elevate the story on screen, but remain firmly subordinate to it. This can create issues when the score is taken out of context, since musical ideas that make sense with context can come across as weakened or incomplete without context. When you listen to a score without watching the movie, there's lots of little bits between the big themes that just aren't very interesting. \n\nI think the classical establishment needs to take film music more seriously than it does, because there are many awesome composers doing really innovative things with the format. That said, not every film score can stand on its own as a piece of the classical canon, nor do they always need to. To be \"classical\" is not to be better or worse, and the impulse to appropriate film music into the classical fold might do a disservice to artists who choose to use their talents in the service of another medium. Great cinema needs great music. Hitchcock films wouldn't be Hitchcock films without Bernard Hermann's music! Imagine a Sergio Leone movie without Ennio Morricone's scores! A great film score, in my view, is one which doesn't distract from the suspension of disbelief, and heightens the viewer's engagement with the story the filmmaker is trying to tell. This, done well, is an artistic achievement on par with a great work of concert music.

In specific Germanic cultures, the Christmas tree is a very old tradition with pre-Christian roots.\n\nThe story of Christmas itself has changed very little, so religious symbolism associated with the nativity has very deep roots. While the common visual trappings of \"Yuletide\" are largely Germanic in origin, the modern imagery surrounding the nativity originated in Romance Europe. St. Francis of Assisi is generally credited as the progenitor of this tradition, through his use of live reenactments of the nativity to immerse local Christians in the story of Jesus's birth--a tradition which evolved into the ubiquitous Christmas pageant. His use of live animals to symbolize how all of God's creation was captivated by the presence of Christ was unconventional, and might be part of why St. Francis is now regarded as the patron saint of animals. At some point between the 13th and 18th centuries, people in Italy, France, and Spain (which at the time ruled much of Italy) began replicating the nativity in sculpture, a tradition which spread to much of Europe and the Christian world. If you grew up in an observant Christian home, there's probably a nativity set stashed away with your Christmas decorations.\n\nBear in mind that in most places, for most of the history of Christianity, the majority of Christians would have been quite poor, so by basically any measure their celebrations would seem austere to us today. But with a few important exceptions, the Western cultural imagery surrounding Christmas has deep roots in Germanic Europe, with important contributions from Romance Europe in the form of the nativity. That is to say, if you were transported back in time 250 years to Christmastime in Central or Northern Europe, you'd know what they were celebrating, and it would probably seem quite familiar.\n\nEDIT: I want to add that this only really covers West/Central European traditions and those derived from that.

You're correct to note that Portugal's relationship with England was a very old alliance in opposition to Spanish and French expansionism, and this had significant ramifications for their commercial development.\n\nHowever, I think there is a major factor that is both more important and more overlooked: the Lisbon Earthquake of 1755. The Lisbon Earthquake was one of those (literally) seismic events in world history that likely changed the progression of global politics and economics. For comparison, imagine if an earthquake had completely leveled London in the middle of the Victorian Era, but if London was also the main commercial port of the British Empire. Lisbon was one of the great cities of the world, the capital of an empire, and it crumbled in a day. Portugal didn't have much of a choice but to focus its resources on rebuilding the capital. It's estimated that it cost Portugal half of its GDP, and as much as a third of the population of Lisbon perished.\n\nA contemporary British account described Lisbon as \"a city of the most expansive trade in Europe, except London and Amsterdam.\" The Portuguese mercantile economy was on par with Britain and the Netherlands as one of the major commercial powers in Europe. The same account described the harbor at Lisbon as being able to accommodate ten thousand sail of ships. This is significant, because after the quake came a massive tsunami, which threw many of these ships ashore, destroying both the buildings of Lisbon, and much of the Portuguese merchant fleet. Abraham Castres, the British envoy in Lisbon, camped outside the city with the royal family, wrote: \"The inexpressible calamity befallen the whole maritime coast, and in particular this opulent city, now reduced to a heap of rubbish and  ruins,  by  a  most  tremendous  earth-quake..., followed by a conflagration, which has done ten times more mischief than the earthquake itself.\" Because Lisbon *was* so mercantile, we need to remember that the quake destroyed not only buildings, ships, and lives, but also wares. Things stored in the ships, in warehouses, factories, etc. were lost. So the country lost much of its trading goods, in addition to the infrastructure for trade. \n\nSo Portugal *was* a mercantile empire like Britain and the Netherlands, and certainly more than Spain, until a catastrophe struck at exactly the time it would have been starting to transition from a mercantilist extractive empire to a more liberal industrial one. The Seven Years' War began the following year, and Portugal became embroiled. The recent disaster had put the Portuguese at a disadvantage, though, and whereas Britain, Portugal's ally, established itself as the dominant world power, Portugal's relative decline, due in large part to the earthquake, became apparent. \n\nObviously the earthquake was not the *sole* cause of geopolitical realignment in this era, but it set the Portuguese Empire back significantly at what could have been a critical juncture, as Britain and others were beginning the shift towards industrialization.  \n\nSources:\n\n*An account of the late dreadful earthquake and fire, which destroyed the city of Lisbon, The Metropolis of Portugal.

In much of the post-colonial world, the boundaries of the \"nation\" were drawn by the colonizers, and the colonized were left with the responsibility of making a nation take shape, even when the affinities which Anderson points to as source material for nation building (language, geography, culture, etc.) didn't really exist. He points out the nation as a social construct, but doesn't necessarily reject that some nations may exist as naturally cohesive units more so than others. \n\nI always wonder if Anderson's views were colored by his own background, being raised between cultures. He was born in China to an Irish father of Scottish descent and an English mother, raised in America and Britain, where he worked most of his career, but always had an affinity for Ireland and considered himself Irish. His brother, the (almost as well known) academic Perry Anderson, was born in London and considers himself British. Anderson's own life demonstrated how nationality in the modern world has more to do with one's attitudes and the lottery of birth than with anything \"real.\" Just some food for thought!", "created_utc": "1614704974.0", "edited": "False", "id": "gpfmd79", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_lvyj2l", "parent_id": "t1_gpeh3pj", "score": "7", "subreddit": "AskSocialScience", "subreddit_id": "t5_2sml9"}, {"author": "frisky_husky", "body": "Thank you!", "created_utc": "1614272981.0", "edited": "False", "id": "goq4ax2", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_lrlrm6", "parent_id": "t1_goo4x5v", "score": "2", "subreddit": "AskSocialScience", "subreddit_id": "t5_2sml9"}, {"author": "frisky_husky", "body": "This is the study I was referring to- sorry I did mean to link this in the original comment.\n\nhttps://riwi.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/RIWI_ILGA_Report_Marriage_c.pdf\n\nThe study was done by RIWI on behalf of the ILGA.

Younger generations of Saudis, especially those who have been exposed to  Western media or education, are dramatically less conservative or religious than older generations. Some (relatively down-low) polling has been done on issues like same-sex marriage in Saudi Arabia, and close to a quarter of the sample expressed support, which was higher than in some European countries, and driven by youth. Afghanistan is really not comparable. Not only is it significantly poorer and less developed than both Iran and Saudi Arabia, it also has a very different social structure. It's just a more \"traditional\" society-- I put traditional in scare quotes here because systems of religious authority and justice in Afghan culture have changed dramatically since the 1950s due to exposure to Saudi Hanbali Islam.\n\nI would say that this phenomenon likely has deeper roots in Iran, probably going back prior to the 1979 Iranian Revolution. Iran has historically been a more religiously pluralistic society than Saudi Arabia. Even today, despite official and unofficial persecution, the rights of recognized religious minorities (Christians, Jews, and Zoroastrians) are legally enshrined in Iran. Before the second half of the 20th century Iran had larger Christian and (especially) Jewish communities than it does now. The secular tendencies which were heavily enforced by the Shah after the 1953 coup were not created by him, or even by his father, who was strongly influenced by Ataturk's secularizing reforms in Turkey. Pre-1900s Iran was a much more cosmopolitan society than pre-1900s Arabia, which was still largely tribal, and very fragmented. \n\nThe Iranian Revolution is often called the Islamic Revolution, but I disagree with that term because it obscures the ideological diversity of the movements which coalesced against the Shah. Many were Islamists, but not all were hardliners, though Ruhollah Khomeini's charisma helped gain the hardliners the upper hand. There was a strong Islamic Socialist faction which advocated a more progressive form of Islam, similar to the Christian Left in the West, and didn't necessarily believe in theocratic rule. But almost as many were leftists and nationalists who were unsatisfied with the Shah's authoritarian rule, and his close ties to the United States. The perception that the Shah was a puppet for US interests was widespread across Iranian society, even among those who agreed with his secularism. The Shah, his family, and his political allies lived comfortably, but it was a *very* unequal society. After the Revolution, the alliance broke down fairly quickly, as it became clear that the Shi'a hardliners had little interest in involving progressives and socialists in their government. This upset many former supporters of the Revolution, not to mention the smaller but still significant number amongst the middle and upper classes who had supported the Shah. If you're interested in the Revolution, the book *All the Shah's Men* by Stephen Kinzer is indispensable, and gave me most of the context I have here.\n\nAll of this is to say that although Iranians have lived under an Islamist government for 40 years, the Iranian public has never fully warmed up to it. Under the Shah, Islam was a form of resistance against a secular dictatorship. Under the Islamic Republic, disaffiliation with Islam, which in Iran is inseparable from the state, is a form of resistance. I suspect that the societal currents which have led Iranians to become less devout are the same ones which have existed for decades, and I think that they have very little to do with religion itself, and more to do with how organized religion in Iran is an extension of the state. The Iranian Revolution imposed an traditionalist Islamic veneer over what had long been a modernizing society, but wasn't able to dramatically alter the fabric of that society. By contrast, the modernization of Saudi Arabia has been much more continuous, and without the political turmoil of mid-century Iran. \n\nSome Sources :\n\n[https://gamaan.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/GAMAAN-Iran-Religion-Survey-2020-English.pdf](https://gamaan.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/GAMAAN-Iran-Religion-Survey-2020-English.pdf)\n\nKinzer, Stephen. *All the Shah's Men.* New York: Wiley, 2003.\n\nMottahedeh, Roy. *The Mantle of the Prophet: Religion and Politics in Iran, 2nd ed.* Oxford: Oneworld Publications, 2002.", "created_utc": "1614208885.0", "edited": "False", "id": "gon3dcq", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_lrlrm6", "parent_id": "t3_lrlrm6", "score": "82", "subreddit": "AskSocialScience", "subreddit_id": "t5_2sml9"}, {"author": "frisky_husky", "body": "Don't be afraid of darkness and line.

I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of Swiss snack foods (Goldfish are originally from there but they're different). I don't eat much fast food, but I live in a big city so I am used to a variety of hole-in-the-wall type ethnic restaurants, which Geneva seemed to have plenty of. I found very solid Chinese, Lebanese, and Ethiopian places. A huge portion of the population in Geneva is descended from Italian immigrants, so there's solid Italian food as well, including good pizza. I grew up in the Northeast so that's important to me. Granted, Geneva is the capital of global diplomacy so it's a very international city, but most of the people running the restaurants were immigrants bringing their own food, just like back home.\n\nThe biggest thing I missed (and I'm clearly not alone here) was good Latin American food, especially Mexican and Peruvian.

The tomatoes from my parents' garden are as good as any I had in Italy, for example. The biggest realization I had living in Europe is that this is not the case everywhere.

To use a common metaphor, law is downstream from politics, and politics is downstream from culture. Water usually flows downstream, but if you build a dam downstream, it can change the flow of the water upstream. \n\nUsually, especially on culturally prominent issues, the Supreme Court behaves in a manner which reinforces a consensus that has already formed in public opinion. In the case of same-sex marriage, for example, public opinion had already become broadly favorable by 2015, when the Court imposed nationwide marriage equality in *Obergefell*. Since then, approval for same-sex marriage in the United States has continued to rise, arguably in part because the Court largely shut the issue down at the national level. Discourse about same-sex marriage has largely faded from mainstream national politics since 2015, even on the right to some extent. The Court reinforced the flow of public opinion, and basically closed the book on the issue.\n\nThere have been instances where the Court was ahead of public opinion, but in these cases it was almost always following the trend. In *Brown*, for example, the Court took a position which was still broadly unpopular among White America, but public opinion had already been shifting towards the Court's opinion. In cases where public opinion hasn't quickly shifted, there have often been ensuing decisions which \"correct\" for decisions which perhaps went too far too quickly. You can evaluate the Court's decisions in *Webster v. Reproductive Health Services*  and *Planned Parenthood v. Casey* through this lens. *Roe v. Wade* failed to anticipate the (very deliberate) synthesis which was emerging between the American right, Evangelical Christianity, and the backlash against Women's Liberation. The right to abortion constructed by *Roe* was perhaps broader than many in the United States were comfortable with at that point, and the later decisions in *Webster* and *Casey* can be understood as efforts to limit the provisions of *Roe*, bringing it more in line with the political consensus of the time. \n\nKey to all of this is the idea that the Supreme Court, as much as it might like you to believe otherwise, is a political actor as much as the other branches of government. In order to preserve its stature and its credibility, it must avoid disrupting the cultural-political status quo too abruptly. On most issues, the Court lags public opinion, but that's broadly in line with politics in general. Because of the structure of US politics, which privileges geography over demography through institutions like the Senate and single-member districts, national politics does a poor job of accurately reflecting public opinion, and the Supreme Court reflects this. While political leadership, including in the judiciary, can *shape* public opinion, especially by reinforcing it, the Court is the least public-facing branch of government, and its impact on public opinion is less direct.\n\nIf you want some deeper reading on this subject, I'd recommend *The Least Dangerous Branch* by Alexander Bickel. It's old but highly influential. I'd also look at David Cole's *Engines of Liberty.* See also my citations below.\n\nTl;dr, the Supreme Court shapes public opinion mainly by reinforcing tendencies which are already visible in American culture and politics, but public opinion influences the Court far more strongly than the Court influences public opinion.\n\nBickel, Alexander. *The Least Dangerous Branch.* Indianapolis: Bobbs-Merrill, 1962. \n\nCole, David. *Engines of Liberty: The Power of Citizen Activists to Make Constitutional Law*.

As others have mentioned, the \"triangle\" of stove/fridge/sink is sacrosanct. My current kitchen has a triangle, but the only place the table fits is dead in the middle, which makes it a pain to work around. Also, the stove is in the furthest corner from the stove, which has barely any counter next to it. So there's a triangle, but it's way too big to be functional. Gotta love 1890s apartments. \n\nPersonally, I like a kitchen where everything I would need to do is basically within arm's reach. A u-shape with the stove at the end of the u achieves this for me, though that's also a matter of preference. As I prep, I can move stuff towards/away from the stove as I need it, basically like I'm working on a line. I also find that having a primary working space without cabinets above (like an island or peninsula) is easier to operate in, if you have the space to get away with it. On the other hand, I think it's nice to have a cabinet or shelf within arms reach of the stove where you can store things like cooking oil, seasonings, etc. \n\nBE ABSOLUTELY SURE to leave a space for the garbage can within easy reach of whatever the main prep space will be. This is non-negotiable if you're renovating. The less distance between the prep space and the garbage, the easier your cleanup will be. In a similar vein, don't underestimate the amount of space you'll want next to the sink. Even if you have a dishwasher, you'll probably need a drying rack as well, and these tend to overflow.\n\nWhen you're evaluating design ideas, blue masking take is your best friend. Tape out your layout, and see if you and your girlfriend can both move around and perform tasks comfortably. Does one person need to move for the other to get to the stove? Can you open the fridge while someone is standing near it? Basically, the stove, fridge, sink, and primary workspace should be arranged so that they can all be used without interfering with the use of the other. If you need to step away from the stove so the other person can wash their hands in the sink, that's a problem. Your food could be overcooked by the time they're done.\n\nSome final tidbits:\n\n* Get the biggest fridge you can fit and afford. You'll thank me later\n* You'll want a light and a vent over the stove\n* Have a dedicated pantry cabinet, full-height if possible\n* If it's feasible, have upper cabinets that go all the way to the ceiling. It looks better, and you waste less potential storage space.\n* Think about the little things. Where will small appliances be stored? What needs to be on the counter vs. in a drawer/cabinet? Where will you hang hand towels?\n* Outlets, outlets, outlets. Can't have too many. Put the major appliances on a separate circuit if you can.\n* Choose a sink/faucet combination that can easily fit a large stock pot. Even if you don't have one, anything smaller is likely to be annoying for other reasons.\n\nUltimately, the best kitchen for you depends on what you cook, how you shop, and how you like to store things. I think the best thing you can do is to cook together, and be very observant. Note what you like and dislike. Observe what your habits are, and write them down. Everything that frustrates you, or that you wish you could change. Obviously you probably can't fix it all, but meticulous attention to how people live their lives is what separates great designers from the bad ones.", "created_utc": "1612151286.0", "edited": "False", "id": "glk4w56", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_l9jet8", "parent_id": "t3_l9jet8", "score": "3", "subreddit": "Cooking", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh7f"}, {"author": "frisky_husky", "body": "I had a Jamaican-Korean sort of fusion bibimbap that was excellent.

This might be because most parents get a range of toys for their children, and when the kids are old enough, allow them more leeway in choosing the toys that are interesting to them. \n\nThere *is* research, including by the Fulcher Lab at Washington and Lee University, which I've linked below, which strongly suggests that gendered marketing, and even gendered indicators in toys have an impact on which toys children choose to play with and how, which in turn influences future developments like career trajectory. Research has demonstrated that gender targeting in toys have a significant impact on how children perceive gender roles, including their own. More importantly, there is a gender difference in which skills toys nurture. Toys targeted towards boys often require children to engage in creative problem solving, while toys targeted towards girls more often nurture \"soft skills\" like empathy. This can reinforce the false conception that boys are naturally more inclined towards problem solving/hard skill activities, while girls are more inclined towards nurturing/soft skill activities. \n\nA girl that's encouraged to play with \"boyish\" toys may develop these skills more readily than her peers, but it's not as clean cut as it might seem, because for children the social signaling in play is almost as important as the activity itself. Group identity and social pressures have a significant impact on what children choose to engage in, and how their interests form, and studies have found that manipulating group identities and altering group dynamics can change outcomes in children. In other words, *who* a child's play companions are matters as much, if not more, than *what* they are playing with. Anecdotally, when I was a child my (M) most regular play companion was my sister and our neighbors, also a brother and sister around the same ages. We had a good mix of pretend and puzzle-type toys, including lots of LEGOs. As adults, my sister is the \"STEM person\" and I am the \"soft skills person\", which is perhaps the opposite of what might be expected. Of my closest friends, more are women. Of my sister's closest friends, more are men. Of my most enduring male-male friendships, all are with guys who have particularly close relationships with their sisters. Do with that what you may. \n\nWhat I'm really getting at is that, yes, toys matter, but not exclusively. A girl that plays with K'nex is not necessarily more likely to be an engineer than one who plays with Barbie dolls, but she might develop some necessary skills earlier, which could give her more confidence going into that field. \n\nThe last caveat I want to warn about is this: by focusing on play as a source of inequality in high-value fields, we ignore *why* those fields are high-valued. Fields dominated by men are often ascribed more prestige, and when male-dominated fields shift to female-dominated ones, we've seen that these fields become seen as \"softer\" and less valuable. Take, for example, the life sciences, a historically male-dominated super-field which has recently seen a large influx of women. A landmark study in 1974 found that male-dominated fields were perceived as less prestigious as the number of women in those fields increased. People were also more likely to identify these fields as ones in which boys were more likely to struggle. We have evidence of this at a societal level in Russia, one of the few countries in which a majority of the workforce is university-educated. Women make up a significantly higher proportion of the STEM field in Russia, and account for a majority of medical doctors as well. Doctors and scientists in Russia make relatively less money, and command less social prestige than in other educated societies. On the other hand, in Sweden, commonly cited as the most gender-egalitarian society on earth, the gender gap in STEM has remained wider, but there is less of a discrepancy in prestige between male-dominated and female-dominated fields.\n\nTo close, I'll leave you with one more personal anecdote. As a young child, my favorite toys were cars. I always had one with me. If you asked me, I'd have said I wanted to be a mechanic when I grew up. Now what if I tell you that I gave all of the cars names and personalities, and played with them the way some children might play with dolls or action figures? Is it so surprising, then, that I wound up in the social sciences? Children are creative, and how they play, and with whom, usually matters more than the toy. Toys matter, and there's a strong case to be made against gendered constructions in play, but the evidence seems to suggest that social circumstances and interests influence play more than the objects themselves.\n\nFulcher Lab research on gender and play: [https://fulcherlab.academic.wlu.edu/research/](https://fulcherlab.academic.wlu.edu/research/)\n\nCrawley, Donna. \"Gender and Perceptions of Occupational Prestige.\" *SAGE Open* (2014) pp. 1-11.", "created_utc": "1611594957.0", "edited": "False", "id": "gkq6ha2", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_l4ok8b", "parent_id": "t3_l4ok8b", "score": "6", "subreddit": "AskSocialScience", "subreddit_id": "t5_2sml9"}, {"author": "frisky_husky", "body": "Ricotta on a weeknight, b\u00e9chamel if it's a special occasion.

A group can inherit the language and culture of another without necessarily being descended from them, and vice-versa. I'd look no further than Latin America as an example. Lots of native Spanish speakers who have very few genetic ties to Europe. Some are primarily African, others primarily Native American.

But you won't know that without tasting it, which tells me that it's not about the flavor, but the still-common perception in Italy that the heavy use of garlic is for poor and uncultured people.", "created_utc": "1606256334.0", "edited": "False", "id": "gdhoyqf", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_k09x0h", "parent_id": "t3_k09x0h", "score": "31", "subreddit": "iamveryculinary", "subreddit_id": "t5_3h6on"}, {"author": "frisky_husky", "body": "Jeremy Bentham has entered the chat", "created_utc": "1606241083.0", "edited": "False", "id": "gdgsuxk", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_jzu1ce", "parent_id": "t3_jzu1ce", "score": "1", "subreddit": "McMansionHell", "subreddit_id": "t5_3mscn"}, {"author": "frisky_husky", "body": "They're bred to be resistant to different diseases.

I would argue that in most cases, at least in a democracy, culture frames politics, and politics frame the law. But that's a very simple ordering, and its nuances have changed over time.\n\nTo look at the origins of partisanship on the Court, I think we basically need to look at the moment when the Court cemented itself as a co-equal branch of government- in *Marbury* (1803), when the Court more or less endowed itself with the power of judicial review. This established the power of the Court to check the actions of the other branches- a power which would be mostly cemented in *McCulloch* (1819), which established the Supreme Court as the ultimate arbiter of constitutional questions. Without these two cases, many believe that the Court would have remained a relatively obscure institution- though not all believe that would be a bad thing. The legal scholar Jeremy Waldron has written interesting arguments (from a liberal perspective) against the powers of judicial review, arguing that it reduces the responsibility incumbent upon the legislature to govern seriously, and places too much power in the hands of the least (small-d) democratic organ of government.\n\nAnyway, the decision in *Marbury v. Madison*, which so dramatically changed the trajectory of American law, was not an apolitical one. Chief Justice John Marshall, a Federalist, knew that if the court ordered President Jefferson's Secretary of State, James Madison, to deliver William Marbury's commission, they would simply refuse, and the Court would be revealed as toothless, delivering a win to the Democratic-Republicans, led by Jefferson and Madison. On the other hand, ruling for Madison would have absolved the new administration of any wrongdoing. In the end, Marshall ruled that Madison acted illegally, admonishing the administration and pleasing his fellow Federalists, but did not order Madison to deliver the commission, pleasing the Democratic-Republicans. However, he articulated his ruling to make clear that this *was* a matter on which the Court was qualified to rule, establishing its ability to check actions of the executive branch. \n\nFederalists generally supported judicial review, while Democratic-Republicans, including Jefferson, generally saw it as overreach. Marshall, being a Federalist was eager for a chance to introduce judicial review, and used the *Marbury* case as political cover, delivering the Democratic-Republicans the result they wanted, while giving the Federalists the bigger prize- a more powerful Supreme Court.\n\nMarshall was the last member of the Federalist Party appointed to the Supreme Court, but he was the ideological titan of the Court for decades. Long after the Federalists ceased to be electorally competitive, the Supreme Court under Marshall, who served until 1835 and remains the longest serving Chief Justice to this day, remained a relative bastion of key Federalist principles: strong national government, and broad judicial authority. \n\nSo, as you can see, party politics influenced the Court from the start, but the rise of \"partisanship\" on the court, as a contemporary phenomenon, parallels deepening partisanship in politics and society as a whole.\n\nUntil the great realignment began in the middle of the 20th century, there were progressive and conservative wings of both parties. Conservative Republicans allied with Southern Democrats, while liberal Republicans like Robert La Follette, Jack Javits, and Edward Brooke frequently allied with their Democratic counterparts to pass liberal legislation like the Civil Rights Act and the Fair Housing Act. Similarly, the \"liberal\" and \"conservative\" wings of the Supreme Court were not strictly divided along *party* lines, but they *were* still divided along ideological lines. Because of the nature of the Supreme Court, the ideological sorting of the Court took much longer than in the country as a whole. Chief Justice Earl Warren, who led perhaps the most liberal court in American history, was a Republican. Justices John Paul Stevens and David Souter, who served on the Court until 2010 and 2009, respectively, were both Republicans as well, but fell reliably within the liberal wing of the court. Souter was a bit of a wild card, as he was expected to be a conservative when President George H.W. Bush appointed him. Tellingly, both resigned to allow a Democratic president to name their replacements. \n\nOn the Republican side, the influence of the Federalist Society (which ironically espouses views about federal power contrary to Marshall's) cannot be overlooked. The Federalist Society has built a robust infrastructure for young, ambitious, conservative lawyers seeking to advance their careers. Every sitting justice on the Supreme Court appointed by a Republican president is or has been a member of the Federalist Society. When Republican administrations make nominations to the federal judiciary, it is expected that they will have some affiliation with the Federalist Society. When George W. Bush nominated Harriet Miers, his White House Counsel, to the Supreme Court, the nomination was sunk due to outcry from conservatives, as Miers was not a member of the Federalist Society, and thus her dedication to the conservative judicial view was questioned.\n\nThere's not really a Democratic equivalent to the Federalist Society, but it's expected that Democratic nominees to the Supreme Court will be reliably liberal on key Democratic issues like abortion, same-sex marriage, health care, and labor rights.\n\nCandidly, I think we're in the midst of a realignment. Liberals have long seen the courts as the best way to score victories on tough civil liberties issues, but the sharp rightward swing of the federal judiciary under Trump has changed that. Given the structural biases of the Electoral College and the Senate, I don't think this is surprising- a majority of justices were appointed by Republican presidents first elected despite losing the popular vote. While I don't think that partisanship on the Court is going away anytime soon, I think that we're going to see more liberals espousing a more minimal role for the judiciary, on the grounds that it is the least representative branch of government.", "created_utc": "1605124521.0", "edited": "False", "id": "gbytljt", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_jscpsw", "parent_id": "t3_jscpsw", "score": "3", "subreddit": "AskHistorians", "subreddit_id": "t5_2ssp3"}, {"author": "frisky_husky", "body": "Gorgeous windows and high ceilings.

The long answer is a bit more complicated.\n\nFirst, it's not entirely true that everything north of the Roman border was inhospitable. To the *Romans*, and their Mediterranean sensibilities, these places might have seemed forbidding, but don't forget that there were plenty of people already living there. While the Romans are famous for their urban engineering, in the hinterlands there was not as much that differentiated a Roman village from a Germanic or Celtic one. Also worth remembering is that Rome *did* occupy some of the most densely populated parts of modern-day Germany and the Netherlands. The provinces of Germania Inferior and Germania Superior, which was centered on the Main and Rhine Rivers, were quite prosperous parts of the Roman Empire, and are home to some of the best-preserved Roman architecture. Initially, Rome had hoped to annex all of Magna Germania, but the Roman defeat to a coalition of Germanic tribes at Teutoburg Forest (as chronicled most notably by Tacitus) put a halt to this plan. It's not that the lands beyond the Roman border were worthless, but rather that they weren't profitable enough for Rome to invest the resources that would be required to subdue them. Also, beyond the forests and hills of Western Germany lies the Great European Plain, which is one of the most agriculturally productive regions in Europe. The plain was once forested, but then again so was most of Europe.\n\nThe early medieval period was dominated by the Germanic migrations and the later rise of the Frankish Empire, which was centered on what is now Western Germany- the Frankish homeland. Cities like Aachen and Cologne arose during this period as commercial and political hubs of the Frankish Empire. With the notable exception of the papacy, the balance of power in Western Europe had shifted North.\n\nFast forward a little bit, and we'll encounter Europe's hottest commodity: wool. It gets glossed over sometimes, but the textiles industry is arguable the most important driver of development in Western economic history. Everybody needs fabric. In Europe, which is a relatively cool, wet continent, you need *warm* fabric. Most of Northwest Europe is prime territory for sheep farming, and the Low Countries were ideally located between the most important centers of wool production. The towns of Flanders, especially, became centers of woolen textile production, processing raw materials from nearby regions and selling them across Europe and beyond. Flemish wool traders built up a massive supply infrastructure in England, right across the Channel. According to Eileen Power's history of the European wool trade, Flanders became the center of the wool trade despite the coarser quality of English and Scottish wool compared to Italian Merino, because the soil of the Low Countries was better suited to the farming of dye plants.\n\nFrom the Low Countries outwards, a great trade network emerged in Northern Europe, dominated for a time by the Hanseatic League. Trade in Northern Europe was characterized by the flow of raw materials into production centers in Northern Germany and the Low Countries, and outward as finished goods. While this trade was tightly controlled and highly competitive, it is an important precursor to early capitalism, and led to the growth of early finance.\n\nWhen the first wave of European imperialism arrived, the Dutch and English were among the first to latch onto a profitable economic model based on a global network of trading outposts, and the exploitation of enslaved Africans for the production of raw materials. While the Portuguese initiated the Atlantic slave trade to supply labor to plantations in Brazil, it was the Dutch that first adopted this innovation in the Caribbean, and it was from the Dutch that the English and French learned the practice. Spanish colonialism in the Americas was, at least initially, made profitable through the conquest of the complex civilizations that already existed there. Other European powers didn't have this, so their colonial economies came to rely on trade in raw materials, produced on plantations in the Americas, shipped back to Europe for production, and then sold through a global trade network. While most European empires followed strict mercantilist policies, an early form of modern capitalism was developing in the Netherlands. Stock markets, corporations, insurance, and modern finance all began in the Netherlands, and quickly spread to England.\n\nThese new economic innovations, combined with an abundance of raw materials, especially cotton from the Americas, sparked the first industrial revolution in England. The Acts of Enclosure forced many rural peasants to abandon small-scale farming, leading to an influx of cheap labor, and the rapid growth of industrial cities dominated by... wait for it... textile production! Industrial production, and modern liberal capitalism as we understand it today, began in Britain, but quickly spread across the North Sea to the Low Countries and Germany. Germany had ample access to coal and ore, which helped it develop into an early center of heavy industry, dominated by industrial metalworking. Individual industries spill over into neighboring regions, and spark the growth of derivative industries like finance and shipping, which easy access to sea and empire facilitated.\n\nTl;dr: Northwestern Europe and Central Europe were never barren wastelands, and Germanic empires were able to unify fertile lands the Romans had *wanted* with ones they had actually controlled. The commercial towns of these regions grew into important trading centers, and the early wool trade led to the growth of wealthy cities in the Low Countries. The Hanseatic League served as an early prototype of the global trade networks which the Dutch and English built in the 17th century. Imperialism led to the Industrial Revolution, which spread from Britain to the continent, making Germany and the Low Countries into centers of industry and commerce, and some of the most prosperous regions in Europe, which they remain to this day.", "created_utc": "1604082863.0", "edited": "False", "id": "gamjcun", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_jkzujl", "parent_id": "t3_jkzujl", "score": "8", "subreddit": "AskHistorians", "subreddit_id": "t5_2ssp3"}, {"author": "frisky_husky", "body": "Chateau Foucault: Live the Panopticon^(TM)", "created_utc": "1604076825.0", "edited": "False", "id": "gam720k", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_jksblt", "parent_id": "t3_jksblt", "score": "3", "subreddit": "McMansionHell", "subreddit_id": "t5_3mscn"}, {"author": "frisky_husky", "body": "Basically because general aviation just isn't that big a deal in the grand scheme of things.

In that same period they had 469 code enforcement violations, including renting out units that shouldn't legally have existed (including one in 109 St. Stephen).^((see below)) It's honestly appalling that Northeastern continues to do business with them, when they haven't seemed to change their tune all that much, but what else is new.\n\nBasically, for the price you're paying you can and should get something a lot better a little further from campus. You'll get a bigger kitchen, an actual (gasp) LIVING AREA, and the benefit of being able to work directly with building management instead of having to triangulate through Reslife. You may have to go up in price slightly to get everything you want in as good a location, but at least you'll be able to bring in outside furniture. If you have the option not to, don't live in a leased property. You pay more and get less, and have to follow on-campus housing rules, even though you're not in a Northeastern building. \n\nTl;dr: Avoid, if you have literally any other option.\n\nThat Globe article from 2014: [https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2014/05/05/landlord-anwar-faisal-has-thousands-student-rentals-and-many-complaints-part-shadow-campus-globe-spotlight-investigation/6QCwDxN1WTIGI4edPOvjoN/story.html?p1=Article\\_Inline\\_Text\\_Link](https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2014/05/05/landlord-anwar-faisal-has-thousands-student-rentals-and-many-complaints-part-shadow-campus-globe-spotlight-investigation/6QCwDxN1WTIGI4edPOvjoN/story.html?p1=Article_Inline_Text_Link)", "created_utc": "1597013888.0", "edited": "False", "id": "g0xsofs", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_i6s62c", "parent_id": "t3_i6s62c", "score": "5", "subreddit": "NEU", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r47x"}, {"author": "frisky_husky", "body": "Assimilation is a big part of it. Regardless of the prejudice that Irish and (to a significantly lesser extent) Scottish immigrants to the US faced, the fact of the matter is that most of them already spoke English upon arrival (even if some may have spoken Irish/Scottish Gaelic/Scots at home), and were quick to assimilate into the English-speaking American mainstream, at least linguistically. \n\nItalians are somewhat unique among European-American immigrant groups in that a more significant portion of the Italian-American population still has some basic command of Italian. Immigrants from Britain and Ireland generally didn't have this, since they generally spoke English at home. They didn't need to know Irish to communicate with their grandparents, since their grandparents almost certainly spoke English. \n\nAlso, take care not to overestimate the impact of these languages on the dialects of English spoken outside of these communities. While there's certainly some spillover, especially in New York, the influence of Italian languages on New Yorkers' accents is not that significant, unless the speaker in question happens to be both Italian and from the New York area. In New York, accents fall on ethnic lines. The Jewish New York accent differs from the Italian New York accent, which differs from the Puerto Rican New York accent. Of course, this means that every ethnic group that has settled in New York at scale has contributed something to the New York dialect as a whole, but the linguistic influence of a given ethnic group varies depending on the background of the speaker. This association probably colors your perception, but would you really single out these features as \"Italian\" if you didn't already associate Italian Americans with New York?\n\nIrish, English, and Scottish Americans are also the most evenly dispersed of European ethnic groups in the US (even more than Germans, though the census counts more of them). It's true that in the Northeast the Irish still form a more distinct ethnic bloc, but most demographers believe that this doesn't really reflect the true ethnic makeup of the US. It's generally thought that most white Americans have at least some British or Irish ancestry, but tend to associate with more recent or \"distinct\" groups. They are the ethnic backdrop to the American melting pot, to the extent that the linguistic features that are inherited from their dialects don't register as distinct.", "created_utc": "1597001686.0", "edited": "False", "id": "g0x5oux", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_i6o06x", "parent_id": "t3_i6o06x", "score": "1", "subreddit": "linguistics", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhos"}, {"author": "frisky_husky", "body": "I would avoid American schools, because with exceptions for the very top tier where she'll be paying a lot more as an international student (as US universities generally use international tuition to subsidize financial aid for domestic students), the bang for your buck generally isn't great.

You're following a basic formula of 1.) making your central claim -> 2.) gathering information -> 3.) defending your claim with whatever information you could find. The problem with this is that you're entering your research phase with a predetermined outcome, which is methodologically problematic.\n\nInstead, identify a subject area that interests you, and gather information before identifying your thesis. Here's an example of how this might work in practice:\n\nSay I have an interest in the christianization of indigenous peoples in colonial-era Quebec. My first step, before I begin to identify the argument I'm making in my paper, is to gather information. I would look at primary sources from the period, from the perspective of the native peoples, lay people, European colonists, missionaries, clerics, etc. I would gather as many perspectives as possible from the people who experienced this historical phenomenon firsthand. Then I would read the analysis of other historians, and academics in related fields like sociology, anthropology, archaeology, indigenous studies, and religious studies. I'd evaluate their views, and reflect upon them critically as I build my argument. Then, finally, I identify the point I'd like to make, and explain how the information I used ***pushed me to arrive at this conclusion*****.** \n\nThere's a reason that an academic paper is typically bookended by a thesis statement. The thesis comes first in the paper, but it is the ***last*** thing identified in the historical research process. This is why, in many academic settings, you're expected to offer a paper proposal and a literature review before you actually write a paper- it's proof that you've done enough research to tentatively offer an argument rooted in available evidence. At the undergraduate level this step is often skipped, but the assumption that your argument will follow the evidence, and not the other way around, still stands.\n\nReasoning can be either *deductive* (the conclusion is certain, and you're analyzing what brought it about) or *inductive* (the conclusion is uncertain, but an evidence-based argument has led the researcher to arrive at this conclusion). \n\n At the collegiate level and beyond, you should never go in with any fixed expectation of what you will find, because the incredible thing about history is that new arguments and discoveries are made all the time! \n\nI hope this helps you improve your writing.

It was once thought that Indo-European was split into the \"centum\" and \"satem\" clades, based on their treatment of certain velar sounds, but the discovery of the Tocharian languages, which are geographically and chronologically isolated from the other centum languages, threw a wrench in that theory, and the two groupings are now used more as a general term of convenience to describe a shared set of sound changes, which is still significant in itself, as it can lead to some words in the Slavic languages resembling some in the Indo-Aryan languages more frequently than in most other European languages.\n\nAlso worth remembering that the Iranian languages were once much more widespread. Prior to the Turkic migrations, most of Central Asia was Iranian-speaking, and the territory of the Iranian languages extended well into Europe. The Eastern Iranian-speaking Scythians (who were more of a loose cultural grouping than a single society) were eventually assimilated into the Proto-Slavic population which spread from (we think) what is now Poland, Belarus, and Ukraine. We know this due to a collection of identified substrate words in Slavic that are known to be of Eastern Iranian origin, and which refer to certain cultural practices which became common among Slavic groups. There is also a broader Eastern Iranian influence which simply was the result of prolonged interaction, in addition to eventual assimilation. That Iranian cultural sphere spanned the entire territory from Eastern Europe to India. So it is not only that the Indo-Aryan languages share a genetic clade with the Iranian languages, but also that Iranian cultural influence in South Asia has been quite strong over several millennia. Even when there were no Iranian speakers left in the steppes of Eastern Europe, there was still some interaction.\n\nIn Bulgarian in particular, there is also probably some influence from the Romani language, which is an Indo-Aryan language that has been spoken in Southeastern Europe for centuries.\n\nSo the similarities you noticed are probably a combination of of a.) similar sound changes from shared Proto-Indo-European roots, b.) the influence of Eastern Iranian on Proto-Slavic, or c.) loan words borrowed from Indo-Iranian languages at some point in the last millennium", "created_utc": "1591116550.0", "edited": "False", "id": "fsnglfd", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_gv4z10", "parent_id": "t3_gv4z10", "score": "7", "subreddit": "linguistics", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhos"}, {"author": "frisky_husky", "body": "More than half of what was Mexico upon its independence is now part of the United States.

There's plenty of thoughtless modernism that is neglectful of its surroundings, poorly suited to its purpose, and aesthetically lacking.\n\nWhat differs is the visual significance of the materials used. Part of what makes McMansions so horrid is the visual disconnect between the materials used (or should I say, materials tacked on) and the structural function of those materials. Columns that are too spindly to support a huge jut of brick, floating masses of stone that don't even try to look like they're holding anything up, the like. The material language of modernism makes that a bit more difficult to screw up.\n\nWhat keeps modernism attached to the classical architectural canon is the relationship between form and function. The columns of classical architecture evolved directly from the earliest post-and-lintel construction. Their primary role was structural, their secondary role was architectural, in how they shape spaces, and their third role was ornamental, insofar as they were structurally necessary, so they may as well look interesting. Where modernism diverges is in its assertion that modern industrial construction methods require us to reexamine that visual relationship, and to maintain (to some extent) its authenticity. I-beams are to Mies what columns are to Vitruvius: a visual communication of the building's structural scheme.\n\nThen postmodernism came along, and encouraged us to think about what those elements are communicating *symbolically*, not just structurally. It embraced the idea that the visual language of architecture communicates structural and social function concurrently.\n\nThe McModern (I wouldn't include this house under that description, however. It's got plenty of flaws, but looks like at least *some* thought went into it.) is a corrupted post-postmodern phenomenon, in the same way that McMansions could be understood as the visual elements of traditional architecture applied in a careless way to communicate social hierarchy, without respect to their function.\n\nIn this case, the visual language of modernism has entered the architectural vernacular. As a result, it's been applied carelessly, without respect to site or function or the principles of good architecture. The symbolism has been abused to communicate a social role, while the original function of that visual language, and the care that was put into applying it, have been lost.\n\nIn a society where many social elites live in modern houses designed by diligent architects, the wannabe-elites adopt the visual trappings of the real elite, in a watered-down way.", "created_utc": "1590254351.0", "edited": "1590254607.0", "id": "frkdhqe", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_glfmxk", "parent_id": "t3_glfmxk", "score": "1", "subreddit": "McMansionHell", "subreddit_id": "t5_3mscn"}, {"author": "frisky_husky", "body": "Bomba is traditional (and delicious), but hard to find.

Last year I was fortunate enough to attend the release luncheon for the Human Development Report, and there's a bunch of literature that describes the study methods and how the score is calculated. It's not quite so simple as plugging a bunch of metrics into a formula- a lot of research goes in to how human development ought to be measured, and how metrics relate to the lived experience in a country. In 2010 the UNDP significantly re-calibrated the formula, so a direct comparison of old formula HDI and new formula HDI is difficult to make (though I believe the UNDP website tries to adjust the formula).\n\nThe USSR's *material* standard of living lagged the West's, without question, but in the key metrics they performed quite well, especially in Russia proper. The USSR had about as close as you can get to universal literacy (as most of its successor states still do), and a *very* highly educated population, at least in terms of years spent in school. Among adults over 45 (i.e. those who came of age in the USSR), over 50% of Russians have a university degree, compared to about 35% of Brits. Only Canada and Israel come close. Even to this day, the average working-age Russian adult has a university degree, while the average British adult does not. The USSR's high standard of education is one of the factors which allowed it to compete with the United States, even with a much lower average income.\n\nThe standard of health care was also generally quite good. Russia had (and has) more doctors per capita than many Western countries, including ones with good quality national health care, like the UK. Life expectancy was relatively high, infant and maternal mortality were low, and rates of death from treatable illnesses were low as well, thanks in part to the absence of pesky tropical diseases.\n\nSo, while Russia in 1990 lagged in GDP per capita and material standards of living, it vastly outperformed the West on education, and was at least on par with it in terms of health care, which buoyed the score. Bear in mind that this all went downhill quite quickly in the 90s, when the economy collapsed, and Russia was a borderline failed state.\n\nAlso, this is an opportunity to look critically at the value of metrics. HDI is useful, but it doesn't take into account other factors that impact quality of life. Liberal democracy, economic freedom, and civil liberties impact quality of life. Rule of law and peace impact quality of life. Saudi Arabia's HDI is higher than Portugal's, but I'd much rather live in Portugal, as I think most people who are LGBT, female, or anti-authoritarian would.\n\nSOURCES: *Human Development Report 1990*, United Nations Development Program, 1990.

The individual is expected to follow the rules of the state, but also the rules of the established social order. This is often misunderstood in the West to mean that Confucianism forces people to be mindless peons, which is not entirely the case. People are expected to continually self-improve, interrogate, and perfect. There is room for individual identity and creativity, in fact this is encouraged at times, but strong divergence from the structure of society is frowned upon, or considered to be selfish. The obligations of the individual are to society and family first, not the self.\n\nConfucianism in Ancient China hybridized with Legalism to form the basis of the state philosophy. Their respective roles can be thought of as basically complementary. Confucianism guided conduct from the bottom up by defining the obligations of the individual to society, including respect for authorities within the family, community, and state. Legalism is basically top down, arguing that this discipline must be enforced from above.

I study it when it intersects with my own focus area, which is political theory, especially ideology. There's a fair bit of overlap, but someone else may be able to answer your question in much more detail.\n\nI think you're right to ask the question, and I think the main reason is that while Freud (and Jung to an extent) have *influenced* a lot of philosophers, they were not philosophers themselves. Also worth remembering that a lot of their ideas went out of date quite quickly. \n\nContemporary physicalism essentially reflects the injection of neuroscience in to what was previously the realm of philosophy of mind. Of course, Freud and Jung, as the two most significant early figures in the development of psychology, had a part in this. You could argue that psychology begins where philosophy of the mind leaves off. Freudian psychology concerns itself with cognition, and the psychological phenomena of individuals and groups, but it doesn't deal much with the nature of the mind itself. You could also argue that the fields of neuroscience and philosophy of the mind have merged to a significant extent- that scientific advancement has made it subordinate to the fields it serves: neuroscience, computer science, etc. \n\nFreud was fairly influential in the development of phenomenology (which considers the structure of experiences and consciousness) directly and indirectly. Husserl, the founder of modern phenomenology, was critical of psychoanalysis, believing that psychology dilutes the nature of truth by reducing it to empirical phenomena. Sartre and Ponty were also prominent critics of Freud, often contrasting with him to shape their own theories. There was a pro-Freud current in phenomenology, with Derrida arguably being the most prominent member. I think it makes sense to discuss Freud and Jung's ideas in the historical context of 20th century philosophy, but not necessarily as philosophy in their own rights, which is not what they were trying to be.\n\nPhilosophy of mind in its strictest sense (the mind-body question) has arguably moved past the need for Freudian and/or Jungian psychology, which was never influential there in the long term anyway. If you adopt a physicalist approach, and then the science moves on, it doesn't make much sense to cling to an old theory. Jung's work, especially after his split with Freud, has been more enduring, but doesn't have quite the same stature, and isn't as subject to quasi-mystical interpretation.\n\nAt the end of the day, Freud is just another one of those figures who was historically significant, but is essentially pass\u00e9.

The Enlightenment had gotten people thinking a whole lot more about how they were governed, and the Romantic Movement integrated cultural heritage, geography, and art in a new way. A heightened sense of ethnic identity combined with post-Enlightenment politics to create nationalism, i.e. the belief that people of a common cultural and geographic heritage ought to be politically unified. The push for German unification in an *ideological* sense began when German nationalism began to take hold.\n\nYes, other European powers were fine with Germany's internal squabbles, because the leading German states were plenty powerful as it was. Austria and Prussia, especially after the end of the Napoleonic Wars, were both great powers in their own rights, and there was a worry that a pan-German state would upset the balance of power in Europe, leading to war. As it turns out that's exactly what happened.\n\nAlso, there was very little unfair about this because German states were doing ***exactly the same thing everywhere in Europe*****.** During the French Revolutionary Wars, Prussia and Austria both intervened in France, not only to stop revolutionary spillover, but also because they had something to gain from it (namely Alsace-Lorraine). Prussia, Austria, and Russia carved up Poland whenever it was convenient for them. Through many clever maneuvers, German houses came to sit on the thrones of basically every monarchy in Europe. German states actively intervened in anti-Ottoman wars in Southeastern Europe, and then put Germans on the new thrones. The first King of Greece was a Bavarian prince. The King of Romania was a Hohenzollern, and the Tsar of Bulgaria was from the House of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha. The ruling houses of Britain have been German since 1714. Denmark, Russia, Belgium, all ruled by houses of German extraction. \n\nBasically, once the German states got bitten by the nationalism bug, and decided to actually commit to unification, they did. Yeah, there were concerns about the balance of power (see Franco-Prussian War), but they didn't actually *stop* anything, in part because the leading German states were in no position to be victimized, and had been drawing from the same playbook for centuries. The biggest obstacle to German unification was Germany itself, until, suddenly, it wasn't.", "created_utc": "1588783888.0", "edited": "False", "id": "fpog22t", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_gel00i", "parent_id": "t3_gel00i", "score": "9", "subreddit": "AskHistory", "subreddit_id": "t5_2sa8i"}, {"author": "frisky_husky", "body": "People's perceptions of what languages are useful are so strange/fascinating to me\n\nI grew up in Upstate New York (two and a half hours from the Quebec border), and most people took Spanish in school, since that's the default \"useful language\" in the US (\"it's a good resume skill\"). Meanwhile, they're far closer in proximity to a French-speaking area, and there's enough native Spanish speakers wherever you go in the Northeast that having rusty high school Spanish isn't a very marketable skill. My French has stayed strong, since I use it whenever I visit Canada, and I get asked about it in job interviews, because businesses around here often do business in Canada. I now live in Boston and work in politics, and Haitian Creole and Portuguese are the most in-demand languages, so it really depends on what you do and where you live.\n\nIf you're working in an international context, especially in business, Chinese is not actually super useful.
