There are some universities in smaller cities which are very peaceful.  Personally, I studied in a university with a large international population which was incredibly diverse, and I really enjoyed that environment\u2014however, since you want to go for design and my school is a science one, you\u2019d probably have to go somewhere else.  That is, unless you might be interested in landscape architecture and other forms of environmental design, in which case my university (Wageningen University) is perfect.  \n\nWageningen is a small city but bustling with students.  You can bike everywhere and we often go to the river for swims or barbecues or picnics. The Netherlands are expensive but I lived in dorms and paid very little in expenses per month.  Following graduation, you will have a year to find a job in the country.  \n\nI\u2019m not Black so I can\u2019t speak to that experience.  But there are many black people in the Netherlands and anecdotally, my black friends have had good experiences.  As a Jewish person I\u2019ve had good experiences with Dutch people, other than the fact that they\u2019re usually pretty naive and ignorant about Judaism.  \n\nDutch people are very friendly.  They take some time to warm up on a deeper level but are very friendly and collaborative people.  \n\nGood luck!", "created_utc": "1666939793.0", "edited": "False", "id": "iu3cy2i", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_yev238", "parent_id": "t3_yev238", "score": "1", "subreddit": "IWantOut", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r5hw"}, {"author": "alleeele", "body": "When I was in Germany, I went to this enormous American-themed restaurant which was basically Texas on steroids.

That\u2019s guilt by association, and an extension of the blood libel trope where Jews are unfoundedly accused of doing things they haven\u2019t (historically it was putting Christian blood in matzahs, today it could be accusing random Orthodox Jews in israel of committing crimes they haven\u2019t).  The fact that you see the existence of Orthodox Jews who live in israel as a provocation, regardless of what their actual actions or crimes might be, shows an underlying bias that all Jews are automatically guilty.  You made countless accusations that Jews in a random TV show have kicked Palestinians out of their homes and stolen their water.  You haven\u2019t even seen the tv show.  They do no such thing.  In fact, said Jews are  *vehemently antizionist*.  So, you made an assumption, based on your bias.  You didn\u2019t even have to watch the show in order to decide that the characters of Shtisel are active terrorists.  \n\nLet\u2019s change the identities a bit.  Have you heard of the Marvel movie Shang-Chi?  The movie includes Chinese-speaking characters.  If we were to apply the same logic, you would be speaking out against Shang-Chi, stating that Shang-Chi and his father are racists who personally kill Uyghurs, and advocating for the movie\u2019s boycott.  Anyone would rightfully accuse you of antisemitism and double-standard against the ethnically Chinese.  Chinese people, regardless of their political opinions, should be allowed to exist as Chinese people on tv, and speak their language.  That shouldn\u2019t be controversial. \n\nThe same logic applies here. The double-standard you\u2019ve applied has roots in antisemitism.  It causes active harm to Jews worldwide, who are often not allowed to peacefully exist anywhere without the politicization of our identities.  Orthodox Jews are a vulnerable minority everywhere, including Israel. Jews are the most targeted religious minority in the US.  So is what you are doing going to actually enact positive change, or just give Jews more reason to go to israel, the only country which we know will actually protect us from antisemitism.  If opposition to the Jewish state is so important to you, what are you doing to ensure that Jews feel safe outside of israel?  Because we don\u2019t.  And we are immigrating to israel at accelerating rates.  \n\nBy the same token, what are you doing to actually help Palestinians, who are certainly suffering?  Me personally, I know I\u2019m doing my part by partaking in environmental coexistence activism.  But you, you harass random Jews on the internet.  How is that going to free Palestine?  It\u2019s not.  Let people watch tv shows about Jewish people.

I am not bene anusim but I have close friends who are, and I am a bit familiar with it.  I am, however, a Jewish person who made aliya and served.  \n\nPerhaps you\u2019ve already heard, but the orthodox rabbinate is extremely powerful in israel.  In your daily life, that won\u2019t matter, but it will matter when it comes to marriage, burial, and Jewish status of your children (if you are female).  The rabbinate doesn\u2019t consider reform conversion as legitimate.  This might matter because many Israelis do care about halakhic status, regardless of whether they are Orthodox Jews (most the more traditional Sephardic and Mizrahi Jews).  I\u2019m just telling you this so that you aren\u2019t surprised.  Additionally, since you are Sephardic, there is an added challenge; globally, Sephardic/Mizrahi communities tend to be more traditional (denominations are more of an Ashkenazi thing) and may not accept your conversion if you want to join those communities.  That being said, I\u2019m sure there is a liberal Sephardic community somewhere in israel.  Additionally, you may find an affinity to the more traditional Sephardic Judaism once you\u2019re there.  \n\nAs for the antisemitism, I totally get it.  I live in israel because I love it and I feel I belong here.  But on the other hand, we do sometimes have to handle the occasional antisemitic terror attack or war \ud83d\ude05 for me though, I still feel safer here.  The culture is my own and I know my government will protect me.  \n\nOnce in the IDF, you will likely draft to a Hebrew course for immigrants.  I used to be a commander there, so when you get to that stage, feel free to talk to me to ask me questions, if you want.  If you care at all about the whole halakhic-rabbinic-status issue in israel, the IDF will give you an opportunity to convert to the standards of the Israeli rabbinate within about half a year.

I\u2019ve been there myself many times because it\u2019s the family business of one of my best friends.  \n\nIdk what you did for Taglit, have you had the chance to eat Druze food or visit a Druze town?  In that case, there are an abundance in the north.  The most famous is daliyat el carmel, but the other towns are equally good.  Daliyat el carmel is good due t it\u2019s proximity to haifa and the fact that there is an AMAZING vegetarian Druze food restaurant right by the Main Street there, If that\u2019s important to you.\n\nIn Jerusalem, you can see if there will be any Boogie parties going on.  You can find them on Facebook.  I\u2019m not as familiar with Jerusalem because I\u2019ve never lived there to be honest.  \n\nIn the far south, there is a wonderful initiative for empowerment of Bedouin women and elevation of traditional embroidery arts.  The Bedouin women are given the materials for free, make the embroidery, and in order to sell their art they attend many workshops and events thag focus on helping the women acquire skills and supply information about social welfare rights, health, business, etc.  I have a bag from this initiative which I love.

We are an ethnoreligion. That\u2019s why you get proud atheist Jews who continue practicing their cultural heritage.  There are Jews throughout the world not because Judaism spread (meaning conversion), but because the Jewish *people* spread (or, more accurately, were forced out) all over the world while fleeing persecution or pursuing opportunity.  A quick look at the [wiki page](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews) on Jews shows that we are defined as an ethnic religion.  This idea of Judaism as a universalizing religion like Christianity and Islam is a new one, a common misconception by non-Jews (who until very recently considered us an ethnic group).  Its roots come from Napoleon, who was the first European ruler to grant Jews citizenship.  However, it wasn\u2019t that he loved us\u2014rather, we were allowed citizenship on the condition that we assimilate and become French rather than Jewish, and treat Judaism simply as our religion.  Of course, this never truly happened, but it changed the world sees us forever.  Lastly, Jews are genetically similar, even when recent ancestry is from very distant countries (e.g. a German jew and Iraqi jew, and this of course doesn\u2019t account for converts, though they are few).  Our most similar genetic cousins are samaritans, Lebanese, and so on.  This is because, as I said, we are a people that spread rather than an ideology.\n\nEDIT:  just wanted to add that my grandmother is also Czechoslovakian, so I am also technically a Slovak Jew.

You are very ignorant about us.  Gaza is not part of israel, but the region is blockaded by BOTH Egypt and Israel.  We did not blockade it from the moment of independence\u2014only from the time when, a year after independence, Hamas started to send thousands of rockets at us.  This is a security interest.   How can you expect us to send supplies to Hamas so that they may send rockets at our schools and hospitals?  This is exactly what is happening.  Since israel is the greatest provider of aid to Gaza, we must also strike a delicate balance between blockade and aid to the Gazan people, who are very victimized, but not only by us.  Either way, to this day, it is still easier to leave Gaza from the Israeli side than the Egyptian side (this I know through a gazan friend who told me so).  All this to say that anyone who *actually lives within Israeli borders* has equal citizenship.  The people from outside israel, have a different government (Palestinian authority).  They also formerly had Egyptian or Jordanian citizenship until those countries withdrew that right.  \n\nHave you heard of the Palestinian Authority? Well, they rule over the West Bank and technically Gaza (though they hold no power there and any Fatah supporters are murdered by Hamas).  Yes, they are occupied by us, which is something I disagree with.  But they are NOT totally controlled by us, they are not part of israel at all.  I can\u2019t vote in PA elections same as they can\u2019t vote in mine.  However, Palestinians in israel have the same rights as any Jewish Israeli.  The opposite can\u2019t be said in the West Bank, where if you sell your land to a Jew (regardless of citizenship) this is punishable by death.  \n\nAs for being a vassal state of the US, this is also hardly true.  The US gives far more aid to other countries, and in fact the aid from the US only began in the 70\u2019s.  Before then, we were on our own.  If we are a vassal state, then so are Jordan and Egypt.  \n\nAs for seizing Palestinian houses, this is not something that is happening.  I\u2019m not sure which houses you refer to, so if you were more specific I could give a more specific refutation.  \n\nEither way, you clearly have never set foot in israel.  We are definitely not perfect, and there is a lot of things which must be changed.  But we are not an apartheid state.  In my university I have Palestinian classmates, some of which are my friends.

Security has been ramped up in all Jewish institutions.  Do you really not understand why a map of Jewish institutions is fucking terrifying to Jewish people?  The map lists such nefarious systems such as the Newton school system, which is majority Jewish, and Jewish organizations for helping people with disabilities.

Not the State, the Land.  Most of us have family in israel.  Why? Well, the vast majority of Jews were recently refugees, and since the world mostly wasn\u2019t too keen on taking us in, we went to israel.  Ask yourself where European Jews went after the Holocaust (hint: the US had quotas for Jewish refugees and didn\u2019t take many in).  Where did middle eastern and North African Jewish communities, which were thousands of years old, disappear to?  You\u2019d be hard-pressed to find a Jewish person without family in israel.

It\u2019s less where someone is from and more what kind of society they come from.

Modern names that have religious connotation (such as having \u201cel\u201d, \u201cgod\u201d as a suffix) tend to be Mizrahi/Sephardic names (this means middle eastern/North African Jewish, and these ethnicities tend to be more traditional but not necessarily orthodox).

Great questions.  You are asking the rights ones.  My frame of reference is that I was a basic training commander in Michve Alon working with olim that didn\u2019t know Hebrew, and then olim that did know Hebrew.  I myself was an olah lone soldier.  \n\n1. I had a soldier with a similar academic background who ended up doing something related in the Air Force despite his low Hebrew level.  I had to really fight for him to get that job and try to find connections, so it was not easy.  But it does happen. It took a very long time for him to start his job because he had to wait for security clearance, which took a long time.  Usually, you need one year of living in israel in order to qualify for any sort of clearance.  As for the connections, I didn\u2019t really have any, but I did it by posting on the Lone Soldier Facebook page and asking around.  I found someone who was an officer in a unit that was looking for someone of my soldier\u2019s background, and got them in touch.  It would take a lot of work, but it is possible.  My suggestion: work your ass off for Hebrew, arrive in israel and live there fore at least a year first (there are other benefits besides security clearance, such as actually getting to know the country and forming friendships that will substitute your family while you serve), and work your ass of for connections.  It\u2019s difficult, but possible for the most determined and talented.\n\n3.  It will pose no issue in the bureaucratic terms, but may pose an issue to you personally: it is a difficult reality to accept that the rabbinate controls everything here, and only adheres to the strictest interpretations of Judaism.  Since you see israel as your homeland and Jews as your people, the rejection you might feel from the rabbinate and from traditional Jews around you might be very hard to bear.  However, in the military you have the opportunity to do Nativ, which is a fast-track army conversion for people like you.  It could be a very good opportunity for you because conversion in israel is hell.  The rabbinate is unlike anything else.  They will require that you join only specific types of congregations, and if you have kids, they must attend an orthodox school.  I suggest the nativ route.  \n\n4.  It poses no issue in the army.  There are many non-Jews serving at high positions.  \n\n5.  Hebrew is of the utmost importance.  You need to make it a priority.  You are drafting to the military of a *foreign country*.  It\u2019s crazy enough to draft, let alone without language skills.  Better Hebrew will open doors for you.\n\n6.  I don\u2019t know anything about that, it might be very useful, but that depends on how good you are.  It could be an asset.\n\n7. I don\u2019t believe this has any influence on placement in intelligence units \n\n8. I think the military always needs intelligent people.  Intelligence is a huge field, but you could also go to a combat unit.  This would not be intellectually stimulating, but you could become a commander or an officer, which I found quite challenging\u2014but more in the people sense.  \n\nFeel free to reach out for any questions on being a lone soldier.", "created_utc": "1654455368.0", "edited": "False", "id": "iba51cz", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_v5762h", "parent_id": "t3_v5762h", "score": "2", "subreddit": "IDF", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r517"}, {"author": "alleeele", "body": "I totally agree with this", "created_utc": "1654431517.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ib8ue4l", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_v5788l", "parent_id": "t1_ib8subr", "score": "4", "subreddit": "Judaism", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qi67"}, {"author": "alleeele", "body": "So many!

You can check out groups for young people like you, though I suggest you also speak to people from this group about specific groups so you don't end up somewhere that isn't good for you, or getting marked by Messianic missionaries.  You can join a synagogue, a Jewish youth group, summer camp, scouts, an intro to Judaism course, etc.  Maybe you have some Jewish friends who might be willing to invite you to holidays.\n\nIf you plan on going to college, this is a great time to reconnect, since most universities have a Hillel center with a lot of fun activities and Jewish life with people your age.  \n\nIf you are not interested, that's understandable.

Additionally, not all National days are widely observed other than Orthodox Jews, so I won\u2019t be including a number of Jewish fast days here.  Not all holidays are days off. \n\n1. Rosh Hashanah - Jewish new year - a family holiday that involves a special feast - 2 days off \n\n2. Yom Kippur - Day of Atonement - one of the three most important Jewish holidays, the holiest day of the year - a fast - absolutely no one drives on Yom Kippur regardless of religious level of observance, allowing scenes like [this](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.timesofisrael.com/authorities-complete-preparations-for-yom-kippur-as-nation-set-to-slow-to-a-halt/amp/) where people bike on highways and children play board games in the middle of the road - 2 days off - Official holiday, businesses close around noon on the holiday's eve. Absolutely all businesses nationwide are closed. Virtually no traffic on the streets with the exception of emergency vehicles. Exceptions in Arab areas. Non-emergency services that normally operate on holidays, e.g. airports, border crossings, broadcasting stations etc. suspend their work for about 28\u201330 hours.\n\n3. Sukkot - a week-long holiday celebrating the miracles that helped the Jews survive in the desert from Egypt - only the most important days of Sukkot are the national holidays - we make huts in our backyards that are beautifully decorated and roofed with branches and leaves, and invite guests for meals - School holiday, collective paid leave in many businesses and government offices\n\n4. Simchat Torah - celebrates and marks the conclusion of annual cycle of Torah readings - dancing and singing\n\n5. Sigd - Ethiopian Jewish holiday - celebrates the Jews receiving the Torah - occurs in Jerusalem - optional paid leave, business as usual\n\n6.

Tu Bishvat - Jewish Arbor Day - plant trees and shit - slowly becoming a sort of Earth Day\n\n8. Purim - celebrate the miracle of Purim where Mordechaj and Esther saved the Jews from genocide by the evil Haman in Persia - everyone dresses up, ears traditional cookies, gets drunk, give gift baskets and charity - crazy parties in every big city like the Israeli carnival - school holidays, optional paid leave\n\n9. Passover - Jews saved from slavery in Egypt - family holiday with a feast followed by a week of abstention from chametz (leavened bread) - official holiday with a week off - School holiday, collective paid leave in many businesses and government offices\n\n10. Mimouna - Maghrebi Jewish holiday celebrating the end of Passover - invite over friends, play music, eat sweet pastries - Unpaid leave upon request\n\n11. Holocaust and Heroism Remembrance Day - National and local ceremonies, \u201cremembrance in the living room\u201d where survivors or families of survivors speak about their experiences, a siren goes off at 10 AM for two minutes of silence and the entire country grinds to a halt (including cars) - business as usual except places of public entertainment\n\n12. Fallen soldiers and victims of terrorism Remembrance Day - national and local ceremonies, a siren at 8 PM of the night it starts and 10 AM the next morning where the whole country halts (including cars) - business as usual except places of public entertainment\n\n13.

Lag Ba\u2019Omer - celebrates the 33rd day of counting the [omer](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counting_of_the_Omer), bonfires - school holiday \n\n15. Jerusalem day - celebrating reunification of Jerusalem, minor Jewish holiday since Jews regained access to our holiest site, Remembrance Day do Ethiopian Jews that perished on the way to the Land of Israel (their community was particularly devoted to reaching Israel, making attempts as early as hundreds of years ago) - parades in Jerusalem - optional paid leave \n\n16. Shavuot - Jews received the Torah, Land of Israel harvest festival (not relevant for harvest outside the Land) - this holiday has kind of separated into religious and secular versions- religious; all-night Torah study, dancing and singing, greenery, foods with dairy, recital of poems - secular (especially secular socialists like kibbutzniks); harvest festival \n\nNote: public bodies take Christian and Muslim holidays off, but it is not a national holiday.

I hope I can visit one day, because I\u2019m very interested in the history and also the place of my ancestors.\n\n2. Morocco - probably the destination I am most excited for in the region! I have been dying for years to see the amazing architecture and eat the food.  I\u2019ve also cooked some Moroccan food and of course we have many Moroccans here in israel, so this culture is quite familiar to us.  I find the history to be very interesting and will probably visit soon.  I also really like the Jewish Moroccan traditions of Henna and Mimouna. \n\n3. Saudi Arabia - if I\u2019m being honest, I don\u2019t know much about it, except that I have a good friend from SA and I like him \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af \n\n4. Lebanon - also a country that I would love to visit, but alas.  Best food in the Middle East.  Sorry to everyone else.  \n\n5. Jordan - I haven\u2019t been, but probably will soon.  I was just talking to a friend who has been to Jordan and telling me how great it is. \n\n6. Egypt - also lots of very interesting history.  As you can see, I love history.  This is also a country I am likely to visit soon.  Also, we share the same rare geological formation\u2014the makhtesh! Only found in Egyptian and Israeli deserts. \n\n7. Iran - also a culture I grew up with.  I grew up with many Iranians, and eating their food.  Delicious!  I also find the history and architecture of Iran very interesting, as well as the cultural diversity.  This is a country I wish to visit one day, if it is ever possible.  \n\n8. Yemen - if I\u2019m being honest, I really don\u2019t know much about it, even though I literally have Yemenite family and grew up around Yemenis.  The food I\u2019m familiar with is Jewish Yemeni food, which is amazing.  However, I understand that it\u2019s quite different from non-Jewish Yemeni food.  I\u2019m sure it\u2019s good as well.

My faculty doesn\u2019t have many Arabs, and so the students are much more likely to be friends with one another.  This is in contrast to programs where there are large enough groups of Arab students that they don\u2019t feel the need to venture outside of their comfort zone.  I think the main issue is age difference and language, since of course people always prefer their native language, and there is often a five-year difference in student ages between Jews and Arabs due to mandatory conscription.  My sister studies at a different university, and she also has some Arab friends from school, but she has told me that language and age has been an issue sometimes.  \n\nI am wont to agree with you, however.  I think lots of Israelis like to pretend to ourselves that we have \u2018Arab friends\u2019.  The reality is tons of people barely speak to Arabs at all.  But it\u2019s also really dependent on your environment and where you\u2019re from.  Many people genuinely do have warm friendships and relations with arab Israelis on a daily basis. \n\nThat being said, we need to do better.  I wish we all learned Arabic as well as Arabs learn Hebrew.  I will never forget the riots of last year.  They really shook me to my core\u2014I hadn\u2019t realized we had reach such a terrible point.  I met up with my Palestinian friend at that time, to discuss things and show some positivity for one another, because I think we both felt it was sorely needed.  It was definitely cathartic for me, however I don\u2019t think anything has improved since then, so I\u2019m afraid it will happen again.", "created_utc": "1651798537.0", "edited": "False", "id": "i7hxk7e", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_uj1mk5", "parent_id": "t1_i7hto5m", "score": "1", "subreddit": "AskBalkans", "subreddit_id": "t5_xmk1t"}, {"author": "alleeele", "body": "I wasn\u2019t talking about crime, but rather terror.

This is a mistake, IMO.  The standards really vary from city to city and state to state.  Personally, I went to a very good school, and I think I got a very challenging education with a lot of breadth.  I especially benefited from my English literature and language courses, where I was taught critical thinking and writing skills.  We learned about logical fallacies, how to analyze media (visual and textual) for methods of persuasion, we had many discussions on things such as censorship and other important topics, and so on.  I studied advanced biology and when I got to university, I actually already knew a lot of the information taught in my cell biology course.  And I was very prepared to take college-level calculus, some of which I had already learned.  My Israeli peers, on the other hand, had much more varied experiences - those who specialized in sciences and math in high school, had no problem, while many students who had specialized in humanities barely knew log and exponent rules.  \n\nThe Dutch system appears to be very focused on collaborative work.  There is a lot less self-study than I am used to in Israel, where I often just teach myself whole courses rather than have to show up to lectures.

In general, most of the courses go less in-depth than I am used to, but other skills are developed.

It is not fair to you at all.  That being said, I understand his concerns. \n\nJudaism for many people is a lot more of a culture and identity than it is a \u2018faith\u2019.  This culture has a religion but is not solely a religion.  Family and the continuation of our culture (meaning Jewish children and a Jewish home) is what Judaism revolves around.  I would say that the majority of Judaism happens in the home.  This takes on even more significance considering the fact that our people have been threatened with annihilation so many times. \n\nPerhaps you know what it means to have a Jewish home, I don\u2019t know you.  However, you should know that in Judaism, jewish children must have a Jewish mother.  Only reform (and some small denominations) accept patrilineal jews as Jewish so long as they were raised *solely* as Jewish.  This might be a good fit for your family, and is worth looking into, but it\u2019s also important to say something else\u2014many jews do not identify with the reform movement, and it\u2019s possible that your boyfriend does not.  I think on a day-to-day basis, most Jewish people in the US would accept patrilineal jews as Jewish, but when it comes to religious ritual, you may get some more mixed responses.  For example, conservative and orthodox congregations would not accept patrilineal jews as Jewish, and this can cause a really painful feeling of alienation for these jews.  I know this because some of my closest friends are patrilineal jews. Halachically, they are not considered Jewish, but reform does not see Halacha as binding.  Of course, their culture will always be their own, since Judaism is not simply Halacha.  But even so, it\u2019s not as trivial as some commenters here would make it seem.  One of my closest friends just found out her mom isn\u2019t Jewish *at age 25*.  It was a closely guarded secret.  This is extreme, and maybe less relevant outside of israel, but it\u2019s something you should know about. \n\nIt is possible that Reform Judaism works for your family and your boyfriend (and his family!).  But since he is having second thoughts, I get the feeling that may not be true.  Personally, though I appreciate the good of the reform movement (especially their progressive values), I find it quite alien to the Judaism that I grew up with, and lacking certain things that I see as integral to Judaism.  That is not the point of this discussion, I just wanted to share the complexity of dynamics between denominations and the eternal question, \u201cwho is a Jew?\u201d.\n\nIf your boyfriend wants his kids to have a Jewish education, this will also be a problem unless it is at a reform school.  And so on.  \n\nThis is definitely worth discussing deeper with your boyfriend.  Perhaps he does not care about Halacha, but is just worried that his children won\u2019t retain his culture\u2014after all, it is very difficult to do so in a Christian-hegemonic world, especially when this also becomes part of the home.  However, in that case you can discuss together the specifics of what a Jewish home would look like, and perhaps that may be enough.  \n\nThere *are* things that I find that non-Jews rarely understand.

Sometimes I feel hopeless that we get so much hate, but then the Jewish community gets me through it.  \n\nOP, I suggest for you to reconnect with your roots.  You don't need to believe in God or something like that, if you don't naturally.  It's just your ethnicity and tradition.  Try to find your nearest communities.  Maybe follow some Jewish meme and educational accounts (rootsmetals and neuroticjewishgay on insta come to mind), you can also take an intro to Judaism course or something like that.  However, in my experience community is the most important. \n\nPesach is coming up, and it is a holiday that symbolizes Jewish liberation.  You still have a couple of days to make plans.  Maybe there's a community or family within a reasonable distance to you that can take you in?  I'm sure they will be thrilled, considering your history.  it could be good for you.\n\nWarning--look out for Messianics.

I don't think it's fully justified, but I won't go into politics, but rather culture:\n\n1. We are often characterized as a country of white racists.  In reality, the majority of the population are of Middle Eastern and North African descent, and our culture reflects that.  53% of Israelis are MENA Jews (including myself!), not to mention our 20% Arab minority (many people are also surprised to find out that we live, work, and study together).  Additionally, European-descended Jews are more likely to be leftist than MENA ones, though that's a bit of a generalization.  \n2. We are actually a very safe country to visit.  You are more likely to be in a car accident in your home country than in a terrorist attack in Israel.    And we have very low crime rates--you're probably safer traveling here than in the US.  \n3. We have a culture.  Due to politics, people seem to forget that we are actual people with lives and arts and culture.  I think Israel is a wonderful tourist destination.  We are where the west meets the Middle East, and we have thousands of years of history.  Great food, music, nature, and history.\n4. We are more progressive and less religious than people think we are.  The ultra-religious are a minority here, though they do have a disproportionate amount of control over some government policies which I find perpetually frustrating.  Keyword is \\*disproportionate\\*. \n5. We have socialist roots.  Many people see us as a proxy for the US, but the US-Israel relationship began decades after the establishment of Israel by atheist socialists.  And to this day, this has an influence.  No one here would ever debate universal healthcare, for example.  \n6. Without going too deep into politics, I find that a lot of people like to opine on our situation without knowing anything or having a stake in the matter.  Usually, they have no idea about the Middle East or our culture.  This means that many people use us as a metaphor for whatever political issues their country is going through, whether justified or not.  One of the examples I can think of is racism and policing in the US.  I've seen many comparisons on this subject between Israel and the US, and this is extremely ignorant.  For one, Arabs in Israel have been \\*protesting for more policing\\* in their communities and this has been a huge issue, with a greater budget recently being allocated to policing in Arab communities (to great approval from Arab Israelis!).  For another, it's not really always possible to tell apart Arabs and Jews, since a) Arabs are diverse and run the gamut in terms of skin color, and b) the majority of Israeli Jews are also from Arab/MENA countries.  Therefore, identity politics in Israel are quite different from the US, most of the relations are between POC rather than white vs. everyone else.", "created_utc": "1648912088.0", "edited": "False", "id": "i345nvk", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_ttozmb", "parent_id": "t3_ttozmb", "score": "4", "subreddit": "AskEurope", "subreddit_id": "t5_2uayg"}, {"author": "alleeele", "body": "This is also how I grew up in the US with Israeli parents.", "created_utc": "1648910680.0", "edited": "False", "id": "i342n3v", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_tttqlr", "parent_id": "t1_i33dtug", "score": "1", "subreddit": "AskEurope", "subreddit_id": "t5_2uayg"}, {"author": "alleeele", "body": "Great question.  I think I'm qualified to answer since I grew up between two nationalities.  I was born and raised in the US, but my parents are Israeli.  I grew up speaking Hebrew (my first language), in a large Israeli community and visiting Israel fairly often.  I even grew up with the same children's books and TV shows, music, food, and other aspects of Israeli culture.  At this point, I have also lived in Israel for quite a while and served my mandatory military service, as all Israelis do.  \n\nIsrael has many immigrants, but that doesn't mean that just anyone is considered Israeli.  It doesn't have to do with birth or where your parents are from; anyone who has grown up here is Israeli, no matter what.  As for immigrants, I think it just depends on the person.  People who really 'get' the mentality, speak the language, are well-integrated, can be considered Israeli or as some sort of Israeli-something hybrid.  However, there are many immigrants who have been here for many years and haven't really gotten into the mentality, so while they are accepted, maybe they would never be considered Israeli.  I think it's quite subjective-- it's one of those things that when you know, you know.  \n\nPersonally, I feel myself to be half American and half Israeli.  I am not like my American friends since I grew up with a different language and culture at home, and I don't feel like I relate to many aspects of American culture.  On the other hand, I definitely am American, and that can show up in many ways.  I speak English better than Hebrew (even if my Hebrew is almost native-like), I still celebrate Thanksgiving and  4th of July, and so on.  However, I don't think anyone in Israel who knows me doubts that I'm Israeli.  I have said the sentence \"as an Israeli\" many times and no one has ever objected.  This also relates to the fact that I completed my service since this is a really important aspect of understanding Israeli culture.  Immigrants that haven't served usually have a much tougher time integrating.  \n\nIn conclusion, I think it's more of a subjective cultural thing than anything else.", "created_utc": "1648910633.0", "edited": "False", "id": "i342jk4", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_tttqlr", "parent_id": "t3_tttqlr", "score": "3", "subreddit": "AskEurope", "subreddit_id": "t5_2uayg"}, {"author": "alleeele", "body": "I\u2019m glad to help!

Orthodox people are often modern, a regular part of society, not necessarily particularly extreme, just that religion has a big part of their life (and in Judaism we have many rules and traditions, so that means a lot).  I\u2019m secular and have many religious friends from school and work.  Ultra-orthodox is a different matter.  They are a very small but might percentage of Israeli population.  They are identifiable by all-black and modest clothing, usually speak Yiddish (unless they are Sephardic/Mizrahi), and quite insular.  Their men generally study Tanakh (Jewish holy books) all day, which is subsidized by the state (to the chagrin of basically everyone else).

However, things are changing.  Many people are leaving the ultra-orthodox sects and the state has many programs in place to help those people learn skills and integrate into society.  \n\nWhy are they so powerful? A few reasons.  First, though the state founders were secular socialists, all Jewish groups needed to be United when the state was first founded, so that we wouldn\u2019t dissolve into civil war.  Therefore, first PM Ben Gurion gave the ultra-orthodox what he saw as small concessions in order to get them to unite with the larger group.  As they\u2019ve grown in population, this has become a bigger deal.  Second of all, ultra-orthodox vote en masse for their personal parties with little variation, so they are a powerful and reliable voting bloc that a smart politician can use so long as that politician agrees to continue to subsidize their lifestyle (e.g. Bibi Netanyahu).  \n\nPersonally I\u2019m not a fan.", "created_utc": "1648542676.0", "edited": "False", "id": "i2jhulg", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_tqcplw", "parent_id": "t3_tqcplw", "score": "4", "subreddit": "AskEurope", "subreddit_id": "t5_2uayg"}, {"author": "alleeele", "body": "I bet he finds his own jokes to compliment himself!!", "created_utc": "1648538132.0", "edited": "False", "id": "i2jcpqq", "is_submitter": "True", "link_id": "t3_tq4fot", "parent_id": "t1_i2inwr8", "score": "1", "subreddit": "marvelmemes", "subreddit_id": "t5_35mye"}, {"author": "alleeele", "body": "I\u2019m a fan of Sierra Ferrel, especially live", "created_utc": "1648508697.0", "edited": "False", "id": "i2hxc6t", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_tqax7t", "parent_id": "t1_i2gv3dp", "score": "1", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i"}, {"author": "alleeele", "body": "Love this!", "created_utc": "1648479245.0", "edited": "False", "id": "i2fzoqj", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_tq7y0u", "parent_id": "t3_tq7y0u", "score": "3", "subreddit": "ImaginaryMindscapes", "subreddit_id": "t5_36dgd"}, {"author": "alleeele", "body": "I do this \ud83d\ude0a", "created_utc": "1648472856.0", "edited": "False", "id": "i2fls42", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_tpmfti", "parent_id": "t1_i2bvo3j", "score": "1", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i"}, {"author": "alleeele", "body": "Nobody needs to worry\u2014 it\u2019s safer here than most large American cities.", "created_utc": "1648472760.0", "edited": "False", "id": "i2fllr4", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_tpu161", "parent_id": "t1_i2fkj1r", "score": "6", "subreddit": "Israel", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhvo"}, {"author": "alleeele", "body": "It\u2019s probably more risky for you to drive a car here or in any country than to live in israel.

In their education system, they are not taught our history.  Many don\u2019t even know that our holiest site is right under Al-Aqsa Mosque.  They definitely don\u2019t know that Jews have lived in the Middle East for thousands of years.  How do I know this?  I have a dear friend who is Palestinian and he told me he didn\u2019t know these things until he met Jewish Israelis.  And yes, he acknowledges that we are both from here and just need to learn to live together.  \n\nAgain, you cannot colonize the place you are from.  We have no foreign origin place.  Where do you think the Jews are from if not there? Genuine question.  Where is the motherland? And where should we go? \n\nAs for the connection justifying colonization, this is also disingenuous.  Jews moved to the Ottoman Empire and the British mandate of Palestine for various reasons (refugees and Zionism).  They bought land and lived in it.  The UN partition plan divided the land according to population density of either Jews or Arabs, but only the Jews accepted it.  Which colonial power has been created by the UN?  Is this usually how colonial powers are formed?  \n\nSince the Arab world rejected the partition plan, a Palestinian state was not formed, and the new Israeli state was attacked by 5 other countries.  This is how it all starting.  Many Palestinians were displaced by Israeli forces or encouraged to leave by the Arab countries, while many Jews were displaced by Jordan (who occupied the West Bank at the time and kicked out its Jewish populations) and later on the rest of the Arab world. And yes, this created a tragedy from both sides.  But there didn\u2019t need to be a war.  We might have had a very different situation.  And none of this is similar to colonialism, where genuine foreign powers come to exploit the local population.  All the Jews wanted was to live their lives without pogroms or genocides.  Is this exploitation? \n\nThe legality is West Bank settlements is actually debated, but again, I think it\u2019s irrelevant. I care more about reality on the ground, which I find to be an injustice.  However, I must point out that if the settlements in Area C (not B or A, which are also illegal by Israeli law) are illegal, then during the Oslo Accords the Palestinian Authority agreed to the an accord that was inherently illegal\u2014since this was part of the agreement.  \n\nI would say that the Jews who want to live in settlements should be allowed to live there, but simply under Palestinian Authority government.  Same as arab Israelis live in israel.  However, they would likely be killed at this point in time.  Maybe in a future reality.", "created_utc": "1647765032.0", "edited": "False", "id": "i1drz6e", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_tgx71s", "parent_id": "t1_i1a3ulm", "score": "4", "subreddit": "AskEurope", "subreddit_id": "t5_2uayg"}, {"author": "alleeele", "body": "Ah, so it finally comes out.  You think Jews are a cult and believe in the dual loyalty antisemitic trope.  I now understand why you are so determined for me to be wrong\u2014you are antisemitic yourself.  The trope about dual loyalty to two countries is literally listed in the ADL survey I linked in my last comment.  According to that, 31% of French people believe that Jews are more loyal to israel than France.  I guess you are part of that 31% \n\nFrench Jews are French, not Israeli.  Not all Jews have Israeli citizenship.  Sometimes Jews can\u2019t be told apart from the general population, but sometimes we can (usually the religious ones).  Either way, it is possible to understand if someone is Jewish also by name, by dress, by the neighborhood they live in, in conversation if it is mentioned.  At this moment we become vulnerable to antisemitism.  \n\nI do not blame all French people personally for antisemitism.  But when you are part of a society you are responsible to introspect if that society has some problems.  For example, racism or antisemitism.  According to the ADL survey, 17% of French people have antisemitic biases.  That is 8.5 million people.  That is *a lot* of people.  And also part of the reason why so many French Jews have fled the country.  \n\nI literally know French people who have been physically assaulted and/or stabbed due to antisemitism.  They left for obvious reasons.", "created_utc": "1647764249.0", "edited": "False", "id": "i1dr3fs", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_tgx71s", "parent_id": "t1_i1av87p", "score": "2", "subreddit": "AskEurope", "subreddit_id": "t5_2uayg"}, {"author": "alleeele", "body": "Well, imagine this\u2014if we had a Jewish state anywhere but israel, it would be true colonialism! Any uninhabited region won\u2019t be worth settling, and any inhabited region means genuine colonialism if we are not from there.  Imagine how much worse the situation would be if we had been out in Uganda\u2014then it would actually be stolen land!  And the hatred of us and our country would probably be even worse and more well-deserved.  Additionally, I don\u2019t think anyone would actually move to a Jewish state outside of the historic land.  But we are from Israel and this completely changed the situation, and also means that people are actually willing to move here.  I don\u2019t think the state could have been successful anywhere but here. \n\nI understand your point about Europe and the native Americans.  However, it\u2019s not a great parallel\u2014at the advent of the Zionist movement (the movement for Jewish self-determination), Palestine was part of the Ottoman Empire and was simply an administrative region, not a sovereign state.  And for the most part, up until the UN gave us the right of formation (through the partition plan) in 1947, people were simply moving to the land they had bought within the region, or coming as refugees\u2014there\u2019s nothing inherently wrong with that.  The UN partition plan following the dissolution of the British Mandate of Palestine was based off of population density of Jews and Arabs.  However, unfortunately only one side accepted the partition plan, so here we are.  \n\nAs for your point about America.  This reveals a deep misunderstanding about who Jews are and what we are going through.  First of all, antisemitism in the US (and throughout the world) is rising and many people do and already have jumped ship.  We absolutely do not trust the world to be our allies so we must be our own\u2014look up the [Evian conference](https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/the-evian-conference).  We must control our own destiny.  I think a lot of Jews would rather die than be a nation at the mercy of the non-Jews again.  We will never be victims again, and anyone experiencing any sort of antisemitism or danger will always be protected by Israel. \n\nSecond of all, what connection do we have to the US, especially such a historically antisemitic country?  Would an Iraqi Jew feel at home in the US?  A Moroccan one?\n\nThis reminds me of the book \u201cPeople love dead Jews\u201d.  Great book and podcast.  It\u2019s about the fact that the world cares a lot about Jews that are already dead but not the way we lived or the ones currently alive.  I find it to be very true.  The world cares about antisemitism when it\u2019s in the past.  But in the present, we must be disenfranchised, at the mercy of other nations, without a country to defend our own interest and lives.  This is what would make us acceptable.", "created_utc": "1647763592.0", "edited": "1647768640.0", "id": "i1dqctb", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_tgx71s", "parent_id": "t1_i1aoi52", "score": "2", "subreddit": "AskEurope", "subreddit_id": "t5_2uayg"}, {"author": "alleeele", "body": "Thanks so much for the well-wishes!
