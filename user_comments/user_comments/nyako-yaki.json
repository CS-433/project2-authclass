I've been learning it off and on for many years---way too long for my current level---and I've spent a lot of time learning *about* Japanese and the types of learning materials that are out there for it. (As a form of procrastination, but it's been helpful also.) \n\nIn the past year, I've learned a lot more than I ever have by finding the right methods and explanations for me. What used to be a bunch of difficult, vague grammar rules have started to make sense and I've started to read regularly in my TL for the first time. These resources are ones that I wish others could find who are in my position, as well as \"true beginners,\" aka not serial restarters.\n\nAll this to say, my Japanese level is currently low, but with the resources I've found and study habits I've built up, I am confident I can learn any grammar point at any level if I need to because I have built a solid foundation and have found the right tools to do so.

The grammar can *seem* more complicated than it is since the language tends to be taught through an \"English-language lense,\" so to speak. (Or at least, it tends to be taught to English-speakers as if it were a romance language. Square peg/round hole.) This kind of teaching can lead to explanations that aren't exactly faithful and actually rather vague, which can make someone think Japanese is full of strange rules and exceptions, whereas I've actually found it MUCH more straightforward and predictable than any other language I've studied. The verbs are extremely regular and reliable once you learn the \"conjugation\" patterns.\n\nTo cut through the confusion, I highly recommend [Cure Dolly's \"Japanese from Scratch\" course on YouTube](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLg9uYxuZf8x_A-vcqqyOFZu06WlhnypWj). The audio is strange, so many people turn on closed captions, but the information is, in my opinion, too indispensable to pass up. (I got used to the voice.) This course helped me start **really** understanding what I was reading/hearing, even in complicated Japanese sentences. If I could only ever recommend one resource for learning Japanese, it'd be this video course. (Just going to clarify right now that I don't mean this is the only resource you'll ever need, haha.) If you only watch one of Cure Dolly's videos, watch the one on [Japanese conjugation](https://youtu.be/FhyrskGBKHE). It clears up how it works in 15 minutes. 15 minutes that may save you years of confusion.\n\nFinally, once you feel ready for some comprehensible input, I recommend the YouTube channel [Comprehensible Japanese](https://www.youtube.com/c/ComprehensibleJapanese). She caters to multiple levels, each with high-quality videos to go through. She also provides captions.\n\nAnyway, sorry for the text wall, and welcome to a fun, fascinating (and logical!) language.\n\n\u4e00\u7dd2\u306b\u9811\u5f35\u308a\u307e\u3057\u3087\u3046\uff01\n\n(Edited because I said something without considering the title.)", "created_utc": "1661385297.0", "edited": "1661385609.0", "id": "ilnzk3f", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_wwo088", "parent_id": "t3_wwo088", "score": "13", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "nyako-yaki", "body": "This looks interesting, even though I'm not much of a fan of FPS games myself.
