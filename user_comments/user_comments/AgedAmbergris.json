I started writing a more detailed explanation but it was turning in to an essay. Without getting into the biochemistry, here's the most basic thing to understand. Your body will begin producing ketones once the glycogen stored in your liver runs low, so the real question is: how long does it take to deplete that stored supply? That depends on a lot of factors, including how full it is to start (are you at max capacity due to a high carb diet?), how insulin resistant you are (this hormone is key to switching over from glucose metabolism), and how active you are. \n\nSo if you are insulin resistant, packed to the gills with glycogen and sedentary, it can can 24 hours or more of fasting. If you're simply avoiding carbs it can take even longer. On the other hand, if you are not insulin resistant and/or are very active you will deplete your glycogen more quickly and enter ketosis much more rapidly. In your case doing 16/8, depending on what you eat during your feeding window you may never actually enter ketosis. Depending on your goals that may or may not matter.\n\nUsing myself as an example, when I first tried a ketogenic diet it took 3 days to reach \"ketosis\", meaning 0.5mM of ketones in the blood. By comparison, I now generally limit my carbs even when not in ketosis, and I exercise heavily when I start a fast, so I will often be in ketosis within 12 hours.\n\nThat being said, even though I have a breath ketone meter, I barely check my levels anymore.

That's not really my point though.

I can think of a few good reasons why this might be. In solo Q where people are constantly skirmishing, the ability to apply the proc from NH multiple times within a skirmish makes it more gold efficient than rocketbelt. This also increases the value of a lower ult CD as you'll be able to join more of these constant skirmishes. Lastly, people in unorganized game play (solo Q) generally are not as careful with their positioning as an organized 5v5 on a pro stage. You will get more opportunities to engage without needing the extra dash from the belt because people will present you with more opportunities. Compare that to pro play where a single pick often snowballs in to multiple objectives or the end of the game and people are paid big salaries not to get caught out and assassinated.\n\nAnother good example is the teleport summoner spell.

For instance it is uncontroversial even among keto haters that the thermic effect of food means that the actual available energy from food is less than the total \"calories\" in it. This effect is strongest with protein.\n\nFuel partitioning is of course the other important subtlety and the primary thrust of the Fung's two compartment model of obesity. I won't go into detail as it sounds like you're familiar with this, but as an example that will hopefully square what you're saying with what I previously said:\n\nLet's say you're obese from the standard junk food diet and want to lose some weight, so you follow the standard advice which is to simply eat less. Instead of two muffins five times a day you have one at each sitting. On paper you should have created a deficit, but because you are constantly spiking your insulin, rendering your fat reserves difficult to access, your body can't actually effectively \"burn off\" that calorie deficit from your fat. So instead other processes slow down. You feel like shit because your body temperature goes down. You feel sluggish and move around less reducing NEAT. You may even burn some lean tissue. Even if you lose some weight in the short term it is likely to come back because your metabolism has just slowed to accommodate a lower intake. \n\nNote that in this case CICO as a strategy has clearly failed, even though you have a calorie deficit on paper, because it fails to account for how the specific composition of your diet effects fuel partitioning. However, nothing here violates the basic energy balance. You are using less energy as your intake goes down.\n\nIn the opposite case where a ketogenic diet appears to create a calorie \"surplus\" this is again only a surplus on paper from the perspective of the standard CICO model. Because maintaining a low insulin level allows your body to easily access stored fat, your overall energy expenditure can go up. In some people this can be quite dramatic. Your body temperature may go up slightly, you'll increase NEAT by just fidgeting more ( NEAT alone can account for thousands of calories a day), you may even induce mitogenesis and decoupling in your brown adipose tissue to burn off excess fatty acids. This can lead to dramatic weight loss. But again in this case the energy balance principle has not been violated. The composition of the diet has impacted the energy expenditure side of the equation. There are limits to this though and it is quite possible to gain weight on a ketogenic diet, especially once you are relatively lean. Speaking from personal experience on that one!\n\nIn short the problem with CICO is that people confuse a goal (negative energy balance) with the strategy. CICO as a strategy is bunk, and doesn't address the underlying issue of disordered fuel compartmentalization.", "created_utc": "1655765297.0", "edited": "False", "id": "id45myy", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_vg6ii1", "parent_id": "t1_id3wdg5", "score": "4", "subreddit": "fasting", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s9dh"}, {"author": "AgedAmbergris", "body": "So much this.\n\nTo put it in perspective, how much of a daily calorie surplus is required for you to gain 20 pounds in 5 years?\n\nAssuming a pound of fat is about 3500 calories then (3500 x 20) / (5 x 365) = 38.36 calories.\n\nIn other words, if your calorie goal is 2000 calories, you have a margin of error of 1.9%.

What I'm about to share is personal anecdote and not a substitute for individual medical advice.\n\nI have dealt with several injuries over the last few years, mostly from pushing myself too hard while bouldering. These include a bulging disc in my neck and an AC joint separation. I have found fasting to be very helpful for dealing with the pain from both conditions, particularly my bulging disc. I periodically do 72 hour fasts specifically to target the inflammation in my neck and generally am pain free for several weeks afterward.\n\nI have also found a ketogenic diet to be generally helpful for keeping every day joint aches and pains away (I am 36), and have resolved other chronic issues including ecxema, IBS and GERD through a ketogenic diet with periodic fasts.\n\nGiven your age, you should be careful about attempting longer fasts, but 72 hours should be safe for most people. You may also find simply transitioning to a ketogenic diet to be helpful, though given that you are still growing you should be extra careful to insure you are getting adequate nutrition, which generally for a keto diet means lots of fat. This all also depends on your current state. If you are very lean (<10% body fat) even a 72 hour fast is probably best avoided and you probably want to just try keto or 16:8 style fasting.\n\nIt is also possible that a specific food is triggering arthritic inflammation, in which case you may want to try an elimination diet. Basically you just eat nothing but fatty beef and optionally rice (both of which have extremely low antigen potential) and then slowly reintroduce other foods to find what causes issues. This is best done with a doctor's assistance. Beware \"elimination diets\" based on chicken and broccoli.

These are mostly related to electrolyte imbalances as you will lose some electrolytes, especially sodium, during a fast as your very low insulin levels will stop your kidneys from retaining as much salt as usual. These would be things like:\n\n- headaches\n- light-headedness\n- muscle cramps\n- orthostatic hypotension (the dizzies when you stand up quickly)\n- diarrhea\n\nThe first four can generally be resolved with electrolyte supplementation. Snake juice is popular here though I've usually found a bit of simple table salt to do the trick. For muscle cramps especially it might be worth supplementing calcium and magnesium.\n\nThe diarrhea usually hits around day 3-4 and is short-lived. I've seen several explanations for it but basically your colon is still bringing fluid to help with bowel movements you are no longer creating. This tend to equilibrate withing 24 hours, but you have to remember to \"never trust a fart\" once you're last 72 hours of fasting. There's nothing to ferment in your colon at this point so that feeling is usually fluid, not gas!\n\nI've done multiple fasts around 10 days and all these symptoms generally are worst around day 3 and go away by day 4-5 if they happen at all, and from there it's coasting. Those who've done even longer fasts can speak to their experience on that.\n\nI should add for context that all of these are experiences from someone with adequate body fat (around 42% when I started and 24% at my last DEXA) to support extended fasting.

We get a lot of comments in here based on a lack of basic science knowledge and without much context I thought this might be such a case. I've seen people in comments who actually believe proteins are composed of sugars. Clearly you know better, and I appreciate the detailed response!\n\nMy point was the simple one that while yes sugars play a role in cell function beyond ATP production, in a ketogenic state exogenous sugars are not in any way necessary. The numbers you quote for GNG don't seem like enough if you interpret them in the context of a metabolic state wholly dependent on glucose for energy, but in ketosis very little glucose is used for ATP production (as you pointed out) so GNG is more than sufficient. Any cell with functional mitochondria can rely on fatty acids and ketones for energy in a low insulin environment. The obvious exceptions would be erythrocytes and certain brain cells. There is a common misconception that the brain is a completely obligate glycogen consumer (in which case we'd still need 130g+ of glucose), but while there is always a minimal requirement for glucose, the brain can derive the majority of its energy from ketone bodies and short chain fatty acids. George Cahill established this as far back as the 1970s (iirc the number is roughly 70% of energy in brain tissue can be derived from BHB and FFA) but the misconception persists. \n\nAnd not for nothing, but there have historically been a lot of people who've lived without a meaningful source of carbohydrates in the diet with no clear ill effects. Our current environment in which rich carbohydrate sources are widely available is probably an evolutionary aberration. I myself have gone through multi-month periods experimenting with a diet of only meat and eggs and have had no issues. Quite the opposite. I lost weight, reduced my blood pressure and felt generally great. \n\nAlso, I was totally unaware of the significant role of the kidney in gluconeogenesis, but I think I found the studies this came from.

For starters there are no sugars in proteins. Some proteins can react with glucose through a process called glycation, but in this case this sugar is not available for metabolism. This is, however, one of the mechanisms by which excess glucose causes cellular damage.\n\nFurthermore, even in a non-ketogenic state, glycolysis is a relatively minor component of metabolism as it is an inefficient pathway for generating ATP and only becomes dominant in an oxygen deprived cell.

Under these conditions, diarrhoea can occur when a poorly absorbed, osmotically active substance is ingested. If the substance is taken as an\u00a0isotonic\u00a0solution, the water and solute will simply pass through the gut unabsorbed, causing diarrhoea. Purgatives, such as magnesium sulfate, work by this principle. The same process may occur when the solute is lactose (in children with lactase deficiency) or glucose (in children with glucose malabsorption); both conditions are occasional complications of enteric infections. If the poorly absorbed substance is taken as a\u00a0hypertonic\u00a0solution, water (and some electrolytes) will move from the ECF into the gut lumen, until the osmolality of the intestinal contents equals that of ECF and blood. This increases the volume of the stool and, more importantly, causes dehydration owing to the loss of body water. Because the loss of body water is greater than the loss of sodium chloride, hypernatraemia also develops (see below).\"\n\nIt's worth noting that the purgative mentioned there, magnesium sulfate, is more commonly known as epsom salts.

I am a big believer in fasting for weight loss, but it's not going to help if you return to bad eating habits immediately afterwards. Part of the benefit of extended fasting is that you become acutely aware of just how much hold food had over your life. Even during a very long fast, hunger will come and go and I'll find myself wanting to eat out of boredom or as a stress relief even when the physical sensation of hunger is absent. I think that these realizations have been as helpful to my weight loss as the fasting itself. It's also good to train your brain that you really will be ok if you're not eating all the time. \n\nIt also helps if you spend some time in ketosis before a fast. This will ease the transition, and in my experience also helps with the tendency to rebound and overeat after a fast. I have been more or less full time keto for 2 years it makes fasting much easier. It also makes the scale more reliable as you don't get as big of a weight drop in the first few days that's actually just water weight shedding.\n\nAs for my actual weight loss numbers, I average roughly a pound per day if I'm sedentary.

If you\u2019re feeling antsy or stressed for multiple days on end you may be doing more harm than good. Others have suggested trying a less aggressive protocol like 16:8, though you may also want to experiment with longer less frequent fasts. \n\nYou should also consider what your diet looks like outside of your fasting periods. For instance, it will be much easier to cycle in and out of the fasted state if you are maintaining a ketogenic diet during feeding periods. At the very least you should insure that you are getting a nutrient dense diet of real food (no processed junk) during your refeeds. When you\u2019re only eating every other day it is critically important that the food you eat be highly nutritious. Avoid grains and starches, and especially sugary stuff because the nutrient:calorie ratio just isn\u2019t good enough. Veggies are good, red meat is better.\n\nYou may also be dealing with the long term effects of a poor diet and the effect this has on the composition of your stored fats. When you\u2019re fasting you\u2019re basically eating your body fat and if your body fat is loaded with pro-inflammatory PUFAs then suddenly that is a large portion of your diet. Unfortunately you\u2019ll have to burn these eventually one way or the other but you can help recomp your fat stores by focusing on healthy fats during your feeding windows. Contrary to popular mythology this means focusing on saturated fats and monounsaturated fats and avoiding polyunsaturated fats. This needn\u2019t become a science experiment, though if you want to go that route you can check out r/saturatedfat as others have linked. Just eating real food including meat (beef is best as cows don\u2019t tend to accumulate PUFAs) and full fat dairy and avoiding processed junk (loaded with PUFAs) will get you there.\n\nLastly wrt stress, there\u2019s more to it than your diet. Are you sleeping adequately? What does your information diet look like? How much time are you spending on social media or watching Netflix? Make sure you\u2019re getting daily sun exposure and even better get out into nature whenever possible. Just a few days in the woods can dramatically reduce cortisol levels.\n\nHope some of this helps!", "created_utc": "1626883215.0", "edited": "False", "id": "h60lquy", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_oonskh", "parent_id": "t1_h5zpl5y", "score": "9", "subreddit": "fasting", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s9dh"}, {"author": "AgedAmbergris", "body": "Cool!

He takes interesting observations, jumps to conclusions and states them as proven fact (the lobster memes are well-earned, for instance). He places way too much stock in Jung and biblical allegory, and the Christian foundations of western society. All that is fair. But you have to be doing some serious mental gymnastics, and ignore his entire body of work, to come away thinking he is a nazi sympathizer.\n\nThe 1st clip in this video is heavily edited and removed several minutes of context not only before and after but in the middle. Is he taking a leap too far in trying to posthumously diagnose one of history's worst human beings? Probably. But it's worth understanding that this is part of a discussion in which he's applying Jonathan Haidt's work on the disgust/sanctity foundation from his moral foundations theory to try to make sense of Hitler's pathology. A big part of that theory stems from recent studies suggesting that feelings we generally ascribe to hate, such as homophobia and racism, are more accurately attributed to the disgust mechanism being directed at other human beings. This is why so much genocidal propaganda portrays the group to be eliminated as \"vermin\" or \"an infestation.\" He's on solid ground here.\n\nAlso missing from this clip is the fact that this is part of a wider discussion of how Hitler rose to power due to the pathological state of German society at the time. This is not a wild idea and it is pretty well accepted among historians that the chaos in German society after WWI was a large factor in the rise of the nazis. This whole idea that totalitarian states like Nazi Germany and Soviet Russia are a product not of top-down imposition of fascism but rather a fundamentally corrupted society is a frequent hobby horse for Peterson. Think what you will about that idea (which is influenced heavily by Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn), but I don't see how any reasonable person gets Nazi sympathy out of it.\n\nThis guy also claims that Peterson never discusses the idea that ordinary people are capable of doing these terrible things, but he EXPLICITLY does as part of this same discussion. It's actually another big hobby horse of his. He talks about the book Ordinary Men and how terrifying it is that otherwise normal people can slowly be transformed into monsters.\n\nThe full discussion starts here https://youtu.be/vx4ltQhdlhg?t=3078\n\nThe 2nd clip is excerpted from the middle of a 2 and a half hour lecture. The idea that transposing \"3rd\" and \"4th\", then immediately correcting yourself is somehow evidence of Nazi sympathy is mind reading at its worst and utterly laughable. I am a teacher myself and if I was held to account for every time I fumbled my words in the course of a two hour lecture I'd be in trouble. Give me a break.\n\nThis clip is also lifted out of its context which is again (JBP rails on this a lot) about the multi-level social pathology that gives rise to a regime like the Nazis. FFS he's comparing Hitler to the biblical character of Cain. Hardly a sympathetic figure. Don't take my word for it, this section starts at about 1h:24m of this lecture (https://youtu.be/T4fjSrVCDvA?t=5081)\n\nNow I'm not here to defend the idea that Hitler was trying to punish Germany by losing the war, or trying to maximize mayhem or whatever. I think that's ridiculous. However, our YouTube friend seems to suggest this is wrong because Germany wasn't losing the war until D-Day in 1944 and Auschwitz II was built in 1943. He is wrong on two fronts. First, Auschwitz was just one of many death camps, it does not magically reflect trends on the whole. Secondly, Germany was arguably already losing the war by the end of 1943 as they were getting pushed back hard on the Eastern front. He's echoing a common euro-centric myth about WWII that ignores the fact that the war was largely won by the Soviets inflicting heavy losses on the Eastern front. By the time the Americans arrived in the West, Germany was already collapsing, so using D-Day as some meaningful milestone for when the war turned is historically unfounded. I still think Peterson is wrong, but so is this guy.\n\nThis guy also goes on to explain the flaw in applying the \"to understand motivations, look at outcomes\" logic and implies Peterson never considers that but he literally points out that exact caveat just a few seconds after the clip is cut off.\n\nThis guy has some good points, but he is also engaging in deceptive cherry picking to find some that just aren't there in this case.

Here are the arguments in favor or impeachment in order of increasing realism.\n\n1. The president has committed multiple crimes and additionally seems quite willing to accept Russian aid in the next election by actively sabotaging attempts to secure our elections systems. The house has a duty to impeach, even if the senate is a broken institution.\n\n2. Even though the GOP motto in 2016+ is \"Party over country\" all that is required for an impeachment conviction is to peel off about a dozen disgruntled senators. Not everyone is in a Mitch McConnell district, and furthermore many of these senators actually hate Trump. A prolonged public airing of all the president's many crimes may put enough pressure on them to cave.\n\n3. Even in the almost certain event that impeachment does not result in conviction, going through the process is probably more beneficial than doing nothing. Dems are scared to repeat the mistakes the GOP made in impeaching Clinton, after which they got crushed at the polls. But there is a fundamental difference. Clinton was impeached for lying about a blowjob. Trump's impeachment articles would make Richard Nixon look like Jesus Christ himself by comparison. Public hearings will increase public awareness of just how seriously compromised this president is. Right now, too many people are basing their opinions off of Barr's summary (a complete lie), or the lazy media reporting both of which downplay the scope and severity of the President's actions. Impeachment is also not limited to the contents of the Mueller report. We have additional campaign finance violations (for which Cohen is already in jail), ongoing obstruction after the report release, emoluments violations, bank fraud and on and on. Impeachment backfired on the GOP with Clinton because the underlying offense was lying about sex. It is ridiculous to compare the two situations.\n\nIt is unlikely impeachment will result in a conviction, but even if it is a 1% chance it is worth taking (which would stop the court stacking). In the more likely case the GOP spends weeks of public hearings scrambling to defend their criminal president and get smashed in 2020. Not all GOP voters are MAGA hat wearing cultists, and even if they would never vote for a \"libtard\" all that is necessary is for enough of them to be too distraught to bother voting. By the same token, nothing would energize Democrat voters like their representatives ACTUALLY DOING SOMETHING FOR A CHANGE.\n\nMy 0.02\n\n(edit: typos are a thing)", "created_utc": "1556206811.0", "edited": "False", "id": "elr4re0", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_bgyrd4", "parent_id": "t1_eloypi9", "score": "1", "subreddit": "politics", "subreddit_id": "t5_2cneq"}, {"author": "AgedAmbergris", "body": "This is a short-sighted POV and overlooks the daily damage that is being done while these illegitimate fucks hold power.
