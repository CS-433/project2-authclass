Shanghai is also another major area that still takes pride in \u4e0a\u6d77\u8bdd, but given that it's the financial capital of China and people come from all throughout China, there is a prevelence of standard Mandarin.  \nHowever, I think the real answer to your question is a generational and education issue. Most people who are over the age of 40 or 50 will speak mostly, if not entirely, in their dialect. The younger generation is able to speak standard Mandarin and will often switch seemlessly between the two if they are speaking with people from the same region. Otherwise, they will speak standard Mandarin, accents aside, to people from outside their region. As for education, people who haven't completed primary education or are from rural cities will speak in their own dialect, i.e. migrant workers.   \nTL;DR: Every region/city has their own dialect that is still in use, it just depends on the person whether or not they use one or the other.", "created_utc": "1656133472.0", "edited": "False", "id": "idnkinn", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_vk0bcc", "parent_id": "t1_idn9ma6", "score": "32", "subreddit": "ChineseLanguage", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qyz1"}, {"author": "Ink_box", "body": "Personally, as a translator, you'd make a lot more money with Chinese -> Spanish because that's a far less common language pair. Companies that want to translate Chinese into minority languages (read non-English) often go CN -> EN -> minority language because there is a lack of native speakers in the target language with fluency in Chinese. So knowing a minority language allows them to save money by skipping a step and also being closer to the source material, allowing you to charge more. Spanish isn't exactly obscure, but it's still uncommon enough that you'd have a ton of work.  \n\nHowever, there's a huge caveat. Chinese is an incredibly difficult language, obviously, so the dedication and time spent into learning it to C1-C2 is considerably harder. Unless you're willing to dedicate 5+ years of learning it and significant time studying/working abroad, the risk might not be worth it compared to learning French, which would be far easier for a native Spanish speaker.

Because of this, most of the content is confidental and we often just receive the source text without much additional information. I've translated numerous games where I don't even know the name of it. Another problem is the source file is often jumbled up with system text and dialog all mixed together, so you often have little context into where a conversation starts or ends, or who's even talking. You can always ask the client for more information if needed, but you very rarely have enough time to play the game (if that's even an option) and translate as you go. So, unfortunately, you need to be more generalized with translations. Hell, if I could just see what the item/character/place looks like, I'd come up with an entirely new and more fitting localization.    \nAnother major issue has to do with just how concise Chinese is with character limits. For example, an item I ran into was \u69ff\u7ee3\u6708\u5154. If I want to do a literal translation, it would be something like \"Hibiscus-embroided Lunar Rabbit\", but that wouldn't display properly nor does it sound good in English.

Syntax is seperate from phonetics/phonology, at least in Chinese. Your example of 'If A comes before...'  is irrelevant because pronunciation isn't inherent to having to understand written information. I don't see how that the change of pronunciation would then change the meaning of the word/sentence\u2014to which of course, I'm not referring to knowing how to break up a sentence.

You could grind it out on Anki fairly easily. You just need to understand that your method of studying would be mining sentences, reading material, and handwriting(optional). That being said, even if you *do* learn pronunciation, how would that prevent you from having to memorizing a dictionary of words? \n\nIn the beginning, you largely learn bisyllabic words. As you learn more words, you begin to understand the meanings of individual characters and how they relate to other characters. So when you come to a word like \u660e\u4e86, at a certain level,  you just enharently know it's \u660e\u767d+\u4e86\u89e3 or just clear + understanding.

Most grammar can be pretty easily stated as \u53ef\u662f means but,  \u7136\u540e means then,  \u5c31/\u624d/\u5374/\u5e76 are intensifiers and describe their functions.

For example:  \n1) Every time I see \u8bbe\u7f6e I just see it as 'Settings'.  \n2) For something longer like \u5bf9\u76ee\u6807\u9020\u6210150%\u4f24\u5bb3\uff0c\u6bcf\u56de\u9020\u621035%\u70e7\u4f24\uff0c\u6301\u7eed3\u56de\u5408,  I can automatically translate it as 'Deal 150% damage to the target and inflict 35% Burn damage every turn for 3 turns.' without having to read any of the characters in Chinese. \n\nLastly, as someone has previously stated, there are archaeologists and linguists that have done this for dead languages like Egyptian hieroglyphics.
