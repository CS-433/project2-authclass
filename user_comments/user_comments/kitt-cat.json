You could use this in conjunction with the talking stick, where teams that don't speak out of turn or when they don't have the talking stick get a sticker/points for their group, but those that didn't follow those rules don't get points.

Actually, before I was finished my certificate, because I lived in a smaller capital city, I had an interview for one (I turned it down for a job with more hours).\n\nThe catch with the LINC jobs is that they *rarely* offer full-time employment (or you get it after you've worked part-time for a bit), so you're looking at between 10 to maaaybe 17 hours a week for the first while which is rough... you're definitely living under the poverty line if you're in a single income household (like me!), but even with some student loans, that sort of wage to hours ratio is possible to do if you're frugal. If you're in Toronto or Vancouver though, these jobs aren't entry level and typically pay on the lower end of the scale (still around 29-35$ soooo not complaining if these weren't in the most expensive city in Canada lol). Also note, the union in BC mandated teachers should have 15 minutes of paid prep time for each class (so usually less than an hour a week), and in Ontario it's 35 minutes per class. The rest of the provinces typically offer 0 paid prep time. In the LINC classes, you also have to do something called a PBLA (portfolio-based language assessment) which means you have to do more prep for your classes since there isn't a pre-made curiculum with assements built in. I think this is partially why the wage is so high is because they expect you to do so much unpaid work---for some that's not an issue, for me it is which is why I decided to stick to volunteering with these orgs but not actually working for them haha\n\nAnyways, the there's no r/tesl anymore, so you just have to scour old forums to find information on ESL jobs in Canada. I've asked a couple questions here about Canada and have gotten some answers, so making a post here isn't a bad idea either. The way I've looked for those jobs is through indeed or google searching \"LINC jobs \\[province\\]\" or \"LINC jobs \\[city\\]\", you might even want to try \"LINC jobs \\[city bourough/city that's close by\\]\" (like for example, Burnaby if you want jobs in/near Vancouver, or Missassauga is you want jobs in/near Toronto). The way I used to get the interview (and the way my CELTA tutor's recomended) was to volunteer at an organization that offers LINC classes (like as a tutor or classroom assistant, etc) cause sometimes the jobs don't even get advertised and, as a bonus, they're more likely to hire someone with experience.\n\nEdit: since you're Canadian, you might wanna look into the Odyssey program!

I would suggest looking at r/online_tefl since they're more geared towards online jobs.\n\nAlso, heads up, if you're looking to pay off student loans, teaching in europe isn't gonna get you far. I'm not trying to be pessimistic or like trying to discourage you, but the salaries there are worse than teaching in Canada (and assuming the US too). I looked into it a while back and it was around 1000eur or less per month if you were doing something like the auxilieraire program (they work about 30 hours a week but are paid only for I think 20, I haven't done this so this is just going off of anecdotes), whereas in Canada you'd be making 2000-2600 (before taxes) for a 25 hours work week with no paid prep time.", "created_utc": "1663797381.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ipe1az5", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_xkexce", "parent_id": "t3_xkexce", "score": "2", "subreddit": "TEFL", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qq76"}, {"author": "kitt-cat", "body": "Yeah, the fact that she mentioned both spice and peppers in her original post makes me think she prefers less spiced and less hot food.

It's a great way to have a remote job if you want to work and travel PLUS teaching online if a LOT different than in person (it's harder to get used to online since you're dealing with all the tech and helping the students through the tech and different classroom managment skills etc).

In the end, *a* certificate (like doesn't have to be a CELTA, just *any* certificate) will be better than no certificate. If you can afford the most well-known certificate, do this so you can just get it done with so you can benefit from it in the future. Personally I chose the CELTA because it's the only tefl course that has a standarding body so every course has to live up to the same quality and standards (not even the Canadian TEFL organization that accredits courses here does that). I also liked that the teaching practices (TPs) were done throughout the weeks on the course, and not all at once at the end.

It's marketed like a vacation, so the those kinds of teachers aren't in it for the well-being of the students. The only reason that they can market it that way is because of the belief that Western Englishes are superiour to other Englishes, where the emphasis isn't on the ability to teach, but just the sole fact that they are native speakers. \\[Edit: and it also speaks to the fact that Western countries/people feel entitlement in their ability to teach in the Global South, despite (most likely?) knowing of the qualifications required to teach in their own countries\\]\n\nI think the majority of jobs are to teach minors, so if we take a moment to compare the requirements to teach ESL to kids here \\[Edit: in Canada, I mean\\]. You need a four year BeD and a MeD/MA in TESOL OR A BA in a teachable subject, an after degree in education, then a masters in TESOL. So between 6-8 years to actually be qualified to teach children--actually it's closer to 8-10 because in order to be admitted to most (if not all) TESL masters programs, they look for a minimum of two years teaching experience (in Canada at least). So why is it that the sole qualification of being a native speaker makes it okay for people to go overseas to places in the Global South (which still suffer the heaviest effects of colonialism caused by the countries that these businesses/schools want teachers from) to teach kids--despite not even meeting *half* of the qualifications needed in Western countries to teach the same age groups?\n\nNot only do they have less qualifications than what you need in Western countries, the local teachers typically have those qualifications but are paid significantly less. Like I've seen a few posts on this sub, with people saying how because they weren't white, because they were L2 speakers, they were paid less--one that sticks out, was someone who got a job offer from EF Indonesia--I believe they were an Indonesian citizen who lived in the UK and they basically said since you're not white and you're Indonesian, you get the local pay (which was a quarter of the white/western teacher pay) \\[[link](https://www.reddit.com/r/TEFL/comments/9tuho1/experience_in_working_at_ef_indonesia/)\\]. Plus I've seen a ton fo comments on this sub that speak to that almost \"objectification\" of white teachers to say look at this western/white person we have working with us in order to give the school more credibility. The pay inequity is something that just shows how extrodinaily colonial the TEFL industry abroad is--and it's not like we can place the blame on those countries for that idea, because it was the Western countries who created/enforced/and subjugated non-white colonies into having these thoughts so they were normalized and accepted.\n\nI may not be fully understanding what native-speakerism is since I didn't read the article you linked, but my understanding is more that it is an extention of euro/western centrism, it's a link to the colonial history of the global south, and part of the neo-colonization that is happening now.\n\nThis is my personal opinion, but I actually think L2 teachers do a much, much better job explaining grammatical concepts because they have the personal experience of picking it up themselves--I think this is especially helpful for beginner/intermediate students. I find L1 teachers have maybe a better handle on nuances of certain things, and that's their added value BUT when you're early on in learning, you don't need to be as well versed in the nuance of things (and also, this only works if the teacher knows about those nuances). Even for L2 speakers teaching advanced level classes, they're the ones who've learned about the nuance from someone else \\[edit: so they have a grasp on nuances as well\\], so I think even then it's hard to debate why you shouldn't use L2 teachers in the classroom.", "created_utc": "1655569232.0", "edited": "1655583763.0", "id": "icugtrz", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_vf70tn", "parent_id": "t3_vf70tn", "score": "10", "subreddit": "TEFL", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qq76"}, {"author": "kitt-cat", "body": "I think i should've elaborated, but in my mind, I still think it's important to do something like restorative justice in the community first, since the community would ahve to heal from a traumatic experience.

It was also rough for me since I was newer and didn't have some stuff sorted out. Here are my tips:\n\nWhen a client asks you to sit, charge the rate that would make it worth it--for me, although I love pet sitting, it was always *extra* money, not my main source of income. (Meaning I could afford to be choosy when it came to picking up jobs) I think a good way to think of this is almost like what would I do for a million dollars, but flip it: how much would it take for this sit to be worth it? Offer that, if they don't take it, no harm done. If no resonable amount would make you do it or if you have a gut feeling that it will be to much, just say you're busy--your mental health and schooling is more important than being their pet sitter and a little extra cash\n\nSecond is, I find short term overnight sits very overwhelming--you don't have the food stocked in your own pantry so you're either having to spend time pre-making food or you're getting take out. Plus then it's hard to settle into the routine *and* you're balancing studying, *and* you also don't know how well that pet will handle being away/how noisy it will be while the owners aren't there. Especially during the fall/winter semesters, I only took on clients who I either knew directly or who I got from a recomendation--I would only sit pets who I knew were very chill and would fit into my schedule because I knew it would be extremely overwhelming. \n\nI should point out, my last two years of school were done online so I had more flexibility on where to live and I also didn't have a commute. \n\n**#1 tip though is your mental health and schooling come first --> If your gut feeling is saying you're overwhelmed or like you just don't want to take the sit, don't do take the sit and save that mental energy for the important stuff.**", "created_utc": "1655070321.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ic4u00m", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_vaik3z", "parent_id": "t3_vaik3z", "score": "1", "subreddit": "petsitting", "subreddit_id": "t5_2xeo0"}, {"author": "kitt-cat", "body": "I'd recommend checking on Rover or Wag for rates local to your area!

I don't have any experience with birds and don't know how much attention and care they need, so I'm not sure how much extra I (or others) charge for them--some people seem to use a general 10$ extra fee to any additional animal to work in that sort of thing.\n\nIf you did 50$ as your base, 10$x4 for four dogs (the fifth one is built into the base price), 5$x2 for two cats, and 10$x1 for one bird, that would work out to 110$. Even if you didn't charge for the cats and bird, you would be looking at 90$. That being said, if I'm sitting for neighbours that I know well (like we would consider ourselves friends, or they're friends of family members I live with), I usually take off 10-20$. So it might be reasonable to ask for 70-80$ too, this depends more on you though.\n\nAs for how to broach the topic, I'd say just be honest. You originally thought XYZ, but when you realized there was more then you thought, those additional tasks weren't reflected in the original price.\n\nThis might be unsolicited advice, but I've also recently started pet sitting part-time, I've done it for about two years \\[when i first wrote that I was definitely not thinking I'd done it for that long already, but I guess time flies lol\\].

Something else I did was, just sitting down and writing out my prices for common additional care.

If you want to teach grade school here you need a degree or post-grad in education and you can only get that if your undergrad was in a teachable subject (sadly linguistics isn't lol). Teaching grade school definitely has its own issues though haha\n\nAnyways, I'm hoping to teach adult newcomers in Canada, I feel like I'm an anomaly since I don't really want to teach abroad lol I've done some volunteering with newcomers before and it's definitely somethign I could see myself doing as a career.

There's also a lot of editting jobs I've seen catered towards esl teachers since they're specifically dedicated to editing esl papers (these seem more to be paid by the essay/written work to be editted, so they make a better side gig than full-time job.

If you look at what is considered the [poverty line in Manitoba](https://www.cbc.ca/manitoba/features/notenough/measuring_poverty.html), in Winnipeg, at 30hr/week (and I calculated with no days off) you would be making less than the poverty line here. If you only have *one* child and one adult, you would be severely impoverished.\n\nWages like these, don't allow any leeway for paying off debt like student loans. The lowest I can pay per month is 150$ (so take 1800 off from the yearly income, meaning it would be closer to 15,408-21,144 for your yearly income again, *before taxes* so your actual income will be less).

Surely, in over ten years, the cost of living has gone up, and so I would bet that the poverty line has changed as well.\n\n*Edit for clarification*: Here is [wiki's definition of a livable wage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Living_wage):\n\n>A living wage is defined as the minimum income necessary for a worker to meet their basic needs. This is not the same as a subsistence wage, which refers to a biological minimum. Needs are defined to include food, housing, and other essential needs such as clothing. The goal of a living wage is to allow a worker to afford a basic but decent standard of living through employment without government subsidies.\n\nIf you live below the poverty line, you will be getting government subsisdies. Moreover, if you look at what the [low-income cut-off is in 2020](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=1110024101) for a place like Winnipeg, the cut-off was 22,060 for a one person household so even if you worked 35 hours/week you would still make under the cut-off, so you will be getting government subsidies.

Besides that, breaking down bigger assignments into how many words I had to write per day for X number of weeks so I wasn't cramming :P\n\nJust a heads up tho, while it's nice to get into early, don't stress too much about grades in second year.

Be careful about if the community specifically states that it has a religion it follows/expects its participants to abide by, that's a tell that it might be a cult.\n\nKeep in mind as other have mentioned that being a part of a commune doesn't mean you are removing yourself from capitalism--money still makes the world go round, including communes--you'll need supplies, medications, etc in order to live and unfortunately we don't have the network set up to make those \"in house\"/outside of capitalist means.

I think [this article](https://snookouttawater.com/the-ethical-dilemmas-of-teaching-english-abroad/) explains it really well, and I know this post will be long because I'm really conflicted. The article says it all but if you're welcome to read on if you wanna hear my thoughts lol\n\nFor me, I think the thing that really got me was the fact that you need so many qualifications to teach English to kids in Canada (and mostly anywhere in the West) but as soon as you're from the big 7 countries, that all goes out the water when you want to teach abroad. You know, like there's a big double standard. Not to mention the local teachers get paid WAY less even though they're often more qualified. I think a personal reason for me though is that the only reason we teach English abroad is colonialism--as an ESL teacher we're an extention of the impacts of colonialism. I noticed with programs like EPIK and especially JET that the teachers seemed to be there to hype up the Western world--but that goes for any ESL teaching position, you know? Like you can see that in how they place so much more money on the non-local's salary. It just makes me uncomfortable to profit off of somehting like that.\n\nThe reason I was specifically asking about the adult market is because a) I don't like kids and b) If I wanted to teach adults in Canada (say to like new comers, not in a university) I have in the the minimum qualifications needed to apply and some distantly related experience (private tutoring). That still leaves the issue that abroad, I'm more likely to be paid more than local teachers and I don't believe that anyone should be paid more or less based on their nationality. Like even thinking in Canada, that would be grounds for a lawsuit. Even recently... maybe throught he search function, I can't rememeber... I saw a post on this sub about someone getting told that because they're a local teacher they would get paid like less thana quarter of a person from the big seven countries.\n\nAs for a future int he career too, its like, I have student debt so I can't take the local salary and still pay that off. If I take the ones that pay higher and then later do the volunteer ESL teacher programs or just do ones that are the local teachers pay after they're paid off, does that make up for me knowingly taking advantage of a system that discriminates and devalues the local teachers' work? Would i even be able to do my job well and enjoy myself if I knew in my heart I was taking advantage of the indisutry for something I could do at home in Canada? At this point I'm not really sure, but I think if I did that I'd feel sort of ashamed of myself. The other option I was thinking of was just taking classroom assistant/co-teacher jobs with secondary students so that I wouldn't be the one in charge of teaching (I don't have the qualifications for teaching children), but again, I don't want to teach people about how great Canada is or be used to encourage the elitism of living in the West... idk it's complicated.\n\nEdit: I have othe rthings that make me feel really weird about doing ESL work abroad, [this site](https://www.goabroad.com/articles/teach-abroad/challenges-of-teaching-english-abroad) has some of the other thoughts I was thinking of, but I'll just finish it up here :P", "created_utc": "1645457802.0", "edited": "1645460725.0", "id": "hxub6vr", "is_submitter": "True", "link_id": "t3_sxbzgj", "parent_id": "t1_hxu5qgo", "score": "1", "subreddit": "TEFL", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qq76"}, {"author": "kitt-cat", "body": "Ah, yes, I noticed those split shifts seemed to be pretty common :P I'll give those companies a look up and see if they have any positions available/have their applications open.

It gives you the science behind cooking and gives the purpose behind each ingredient (as well as some awesome troubleshooting advice). For example, if you remove protein like eggs in your cookies, you should expect them to be lighter since protein provides browning BUT you could potentially add a bit more baking soda to help with browning... anyways it also goes through cooking techniques and all sorts of things too. This book also has recipes that come after each section that showcases the science in action :)\n\nThese two were the books that've really helped me get more of a grasp on cooking and baking and made me feel more comfortable altering other recipes.

All sweeteners add their own little flair, so you can always experiment a bit with how much of each you add :) For this cookie it\u2019s likely that by leaving out the sugar you missed out of some extra browning and crispiness but those sorts of textural things are personal preferences. Plus you had other sugars from the condensed milk that made the cookie work instead :)\n\nOther things that might\u2019ve influenced the paleness:\n- acidity (adding a dash more baking soda can help with browning)\n- not a lot of protein (adding an egg would also darken things up\u2026 I\u2019ve noticed when I make vegan versions of my cookies they are significantly paler than my non-vegan cookies, probably because of the egg)\n\nI highly recommend Shirley O Corriher\u2019s KitchenWise book (often found at local libraries :D).

Especially in the book, the main character mentions how they hate capitalism but there's a sort of nostalgia for life back then but not the systems that created/supported capitalism.\n\nAnyways, it seemed to be a lack of feeling included or understanding the reasoning behind why the society was set up the way it was set up--especially when media from elsewhere(aka the US) flaunts and makes wealth and individual expression so highly. Hypothetically I think I would ask *why* someone would want to do something like that or what caused them to think that was the best course of action. Is it nostalgia, do they feel the current ways are inadequately supporting them, is there a lot of drama in the community around decisions--once you know the root, then you (as a community I mean) can try to work with them to help them feel heard and included and to address the issues that caused them to disociate from the community in first place--find a compromise that everyone can agree on so that they can also feel happy in the community.

I think these are two different trains of thought where if she was playing ignorance, that would be a red flag for me because it shows a lack of accountability, whereas if she could actively criticize the police force and understand that she is causing irrepreble community harm by participating in it at least it shows some sort of awareness. \n\nPlus, pigs aren't gonna piss around and take the anti-cop shit laying down and she'll have to live and breathe pro-cop rhetoric while she's on the force (not just at work but on social media if she adds them as friends, in free time if she hangs out with coworkers, etc).

It's made my relationship with my family strained and I would 100% not recomend this route. \n\nFor civil service, I think you can do a lot with any of those positions--libraries are for the people/community and so i think that's one of those chill jobs you can get (my uni offers some casual positions and you can listen to music and stuff while you do it since they're such solitary jobs). I also like the idea of being a teacher's assistant. That's one fo the jobs I'm personally looking into between y undergrad and grad school for the same reason--you can help kids begin tocritically think/question their world around them. Is there any way to work with older kids though and also how much say do you get in what position you get? Personally I find older kids/adults are a lot easier to talk to (I also find young kids kinda draining mentally lol). Caring for older folks might be cool too, old people are willing to just chat since at least here a lot of them seem to be lonely, plus they have interesting stories but sometimes it's hard to deal with some of their world views (ie. being queerphobic, etc). Are there any jobs in the civil sector that are more aligned with what you see yourself doing in the future (like maybe they have people who work in soup kitchens if you like cooking?)\n\nAbout house arrest though, do they pay for your rent if you do that? Are friends allowed to visit you if you're on house arrest? Also is there a permanent record of who does/doesn't participate in the civil service/military? Not to get like annoying, but I'm assuming you'll have to work later in life, will it be harder to be employed if you don't do the civil service/military? As much as we rightfully might not want to participate and contribute to manditory employment programs under the capitalist structure, I still think it's imprtant to remember we will always have to participate in some way just be our pure existence in the system, so ultimately you have to keep in mind how this decision will affect your quality of life in the future is my train of thought.\n\nPersonally I enjoy spending time at home, and the pandemic (and all the time i got to spend at home instead of out) helped me learn skills to be more self sufficient--I really enjoy baking my own bread, making my own yoghurt, growing my own veggies. I don't think at my age (I'm a uni student) that I would've ever been able to learn these things without having so much time at home. That said, I'd double check that they would still allow you to go to school and if they pay your rent on house arrest (and if you'd have to move into a government run facility). I'd also consider, like I said before, the implications this could have on your future and if it would cause issues for you then. Even if they paid for rent in the current place you live I would still struggle to take the house arrest option because you had mentioned that if you got 10$ a day for civil service then it you would have to have a stricter budget. Having to pay for food significantly eats into your savings so it'll be a very expensive six months--is that something you can afford to do (or are there supports in place that can support you financially through that period)?", "created_utc": "1638927767.0", "edited": "1638928528.0", "id": "hno0c06", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_rbbsaz", "parent_id": "t3_rbbsaz", "score": "10", "subreddit": "Anarchy101", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s960"}, {"author": "kitt-cat", "body": "Yeah, lol living in Canada it's actually kinda funny cuz it looks like Skellige in some places here, especially in the mountains by BC/Alberta.

Part of colonialism was the control of language, so why should it not affect how we use linguistics to describe marginalized languages or people? We need to remember and recognize colonial influence on linguistics so that we can be more informed about how people interact with language itself--that's maybe more sociolinguistics but even still. I'm especially thinking of how multiple generations of  Indigenous people in Canada had their languages beat/abused out of them in residential schools, so now their relation to the languages of their tribes is different and ever evolving because of that. Anyways, mainly what I'm inclined to highlight is: part of colonialism was the control of language, so why should it not affect how we use or study it?", "created_utc": "1634614602.0", "edited": "1634615260.0", "id": "hh6yb81", "is_submitter": "True", "link_id": "t3_qavxu1", "parent_id": "t1_hh6v2cf", "score": "3", "subreddit": "linguistics", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhos"}, {"author": "kitt-cat", "body": "Holy smokes this is the motherload!

But also Western linguistics seems to stem a lot from missionaries (aka religious colonizers) and was meant for the purpose of learning more about the other language so they could use their cultural concepts against the Indigenous people to convert them/assimilate them in colonial social and religious systems. I mean, linguistics started before then, the original comments mentions links from waaaaaay back. But it really seemed to blow up around the time colonialism started to really take off. Also, I think it's important to remember that even up till the point of Labov in the 80/90s, there were still a lot of theories about AAVE that were centered around the lack of intelligence and being lesser than White people... that sort of thinking stems from eugenics and white supremacy. And these are studies from the 50s, right? Like there's people who are still alive when those were the dominant train of thought, it arguably wasn't so long ago. (and just because the train of thought changes in academia, doesn't mean that it changes so fast in the mainstream ideas). That's just linguistics but anyways.\n\n**TL;DR**: recently yes, there has been a push to look at linguistics in an anti-colonial way, but it has been used in some devastating and irreparably harmful ways to further white supremist/colonial values... I will agree that it's a lot more forward thinking than other disciplines, eg anthropology or so but that definitely wasn't always the case.\n\nThat said, I didn't mean to connect not having money invested in the field and colonialism.

I was planning to do a house sit during the fall semester (which, hooray is my final semester in my undergrad!!) since my classes are all online again but (thankfully) it didn\u2019t work out. From October to December every week I have different essays and assignments due and I need absolute quiet and no distractions during study time which isn\u2019t always possible depending on the pet\u2019s needs. When you go into a sit, you have no way of predicting how the pet behaves in a new and stressful period where their owner is away so there\u2019s no way to really tell if the pet is going to be very vocal or require a lot of attention or not. \nThe point I realized this was before the semester started, I was watching a dog that needed a lot of attention and wined a lot (my own dog and others I\u2019ve known haven\u2019t been like that so it was a first to have such a noisy pet). I tried doing my school work there (I was doing summer courses) but it was impossible because she whined and yowled so much.

It also helps for visualizing where you\u2019re spending your time\u2014I like the Google calendar for this.

The day before I reread all the notes and highlighted parts of the readings. \n\nFor papers, I start one to two weeks in advance. I divide the number of required words by the number of days left.

Scientifically, this aspect of these theories is more supported\u2014you can consciously learn about aspects of grammar and (although not immediately) someone can at some point in time unconsciously reproduce them. Non-interface theories wouldn\u2019t agree with this, but there\u2019s been lots of studies that say it\u2019s possible and happens. \n\nThere\u2019s other theories that cover this sort of thing. To an extent first language acquisition theories of learning can be applied to second language acquisition, but typically adult learners have the ability to learn in different ways so we should be incorporating other ways of acquiring a language besides how a child would.

Take care of yourself mentally and physically so you can keep up (eg. Get enough sleep, proper nutrition, keeping hydrated, allotting time for your hobbies/free time not spent looking at a screen)\n2. Get a calendar (physical or online\u2014I like google calendar). Make a schedule and stick to it. Some people do a to do list but I fond scheduling helps me be more reasonable about how long something\u2019s going to take me/what\u2019s actually doable in a day. I\u2019d recommend adding an extra 15-30 minutes than your longest expected time so you can make sure you have a enough time to do it. \n3. Give/allow yourself breaks, you aren\u2019t a machine and you are allowed to take time away from school and during the day while studying. This blends in with point 1. I use the pomodoro method and the app Forrest (paid if you use it on your phone but by far the best purchase I\u2019ve made, free if you use their browser extension) to block certain websites while I\u2019m working. It\u2019s possible to watch Netflix and study, you can just only watch 5-10 minutes at a time is all haha\n4. If you don\u2019t get it done when you want to, make time for it another day. This is why visualizing your schedule can help because you can see where the time is being used. For me usually my schedule starts out having most of the weekend off and maybe even Friday but by the time I get to Wednesday it usually all full cuz I procrastinate a lot haha\n5. Make your study times comfortable so you can make them as enjoyable as possible for what you\u2019re doing and so you don\u2019t procrastinate doing them as much. Make a tea or get some good snacks or smth :) \n6. Start assignments 2 weeks before they\u2019re due and work out how many words you have to write a day to be done the day before they\u2019re due. \n7. Pull an all-nighter the day before the assignment is due so you can do the final touches that day and you don\u2019t have to be super super present for that\n8. Act like a assignment is due midnight the day before it\u2019s due. Actually plan to get it done then. Set a timer for 5 minutes and just start it. I literally spend the whole day completely procrastinating starting (cough cough probably much much longer than that but anyways hahaha), I\u2019ll do like a tiny bit at night (like write some points I want to do, nothing big) and the next day it\u2019s way easier to start. \n9. Sometimes you just gotta buck up and do it. Visualizing the schedule can help with this cuz it shows you if you dont do this you\u2019re gonna feel extra extra stressed because you literally won\u2019t have enough time in the week to finish it\n10. In the first week when you still have energy, do the first two weeks of reading/lectures/assignments. That way if you fall behind you won\u2019t be behind in your course work. Th e week when you do this will be really tiring but for me it\u2019s been very very worth it to have that extra leeway.\n\nAnyways idk about you but I think you can tell I struggle a lot with procrastination and stuff. I know my tips aren\u2019t like super rigid but I think for me I had this idea in my head that I had to be perfect and constantly be studying but in reality that was just an unrealistic expectation that set me up for failure. It\u2019s all doable, in the long scheme of your life 14 weeks is maybe as long as a second or two.

It doesn't seem to e very big with physical artists, like for example, I like to express my hobbies and things through clothing and have found it hard to find pieces that include aspects of linguistics that don't look too extra for a professional setting (like think of for math how there's ties and shirts with subtle math equations in a print that isn't super loud but when you look at letter/word based prints it's like the script for something written as a print or like those big colourful letters that are meant for young kids... it's not linguistics specific, like there's no fabric with a subtle ipa print or various syntax trees or something)\n\nI've noticed that some artists in various diasporic groups or mixed culture groups (like Chicane in America) like to play with language and some focus on the in between of balancing two cultures/languages. I'd recommend the book Borderlands/La Frontera by Gloria Anzaldua (I think chapter 5 is when she talks about her \"tongues\").\n\nI keep coming back to the idea of performance art though, you could relate those fleeting performances maybe to the study of signs, and maybe for situational comedy you could relate that to (I forget the exact mode of study, I think it's called...) discourse studies.\n\nI've also personally gotten into making crosswords, palindromes (words/phrases that can be read the exact same way backwards and forwards) and anagrams (rearranging words to make nonsense puzzles to be decoded)... although that's more about orthography than anything. But I also like [linguistic puzzles](https://lingclub.mycpanel.princeton.edu/challenge/puzzles.php) where you basically have to find out enough morphological data from the data set given that you can create words in another language. I guess I consider making/doing puzzles art which is why I'm including them here but idk what other people think about that, I guess art is subjective so it might be a weird inclusion here for some haha\n\nAnyways, idk, linguistics and manipulating our language is all around us and it's used for all sorts of art, it just maybe not something that's at the forefront of the piece itself.", "created_utc": "1627230316.0", "edited": "1627230504.0", "id": "h6hk2fn", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_orblhc", "parent_id": "t3_orblhc", "score": "3", "subreddit": "linguistics", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhos"}, {"author": "kitt-cat", "body": "It\u2019s okay to have a preference of which genitalia you are okay with your partner having but it is transphobic to say you aren\u2019t into transwomen, even when they have the genitals you like.

For example, you probably already understand certain grammatical constructs than children at that age, meaning when you want to learn those constructs in another language, you have prior knowledge to draw on but the children don\u2019t. \n\nThat being said, it\u2019s rather unlikely you\u2019ll be able to achieve native like pronunciation (not fluency, just accent!) compared to a child learning a new language between 0-7, and it\u2019s likely you\u2019ll encounter **some** aspects like gender that don\u2019t come naturally compared to children aged 8 to 15 (this is something even kids in French immersion struggle with, you have to start learning a language before 3 for this to feel natural and be correct). \n\nIt is completely possible for you as an older adult to learn new languages! Other factors that can help are having a high motivation, feeling that two languages are similar or more closely related, or simply feeling that you have the ability to learn the languages, etc. As mentioned, you have an advantage over children even in the first bit of your journey!

I will focus on this first thing and continuously come back to it. My next stage is consuming grammar structures that are immediately useful like \u201cI want\u201d, \u201cI will/I\u2019m going to do XYZ\u201d, etc. These are mainly what I focus on in the first couple days because theyre important for communication. Also don\u2019t forget to look at stress patterns in your L1 and in your target language (compare where youre similar and different so you know where to work on). During this time, I\u2019d also learn the alphabet if it\u2019s not the same as a language I already know. \n\nThen find a book that focuses on grammar and follow how they\u2019ve laid it out. Studies show there is a developmental order to learning languages that is the same no matter your L1. These textbooks capitalize on this (often without you knowing). Usually five pages is the most I can do without burning out in a day and you also need to make sure you\u2019re finding ways to practice what you learn otherwise it won\u2019t stick. Practice writing it out and saying it or try to work it into a hypothetical conversation. \n\nSpeaking of, I rarely have people to speak to and I dont like talking to myself when people are around so I internally speak to myself and this all counts for my speaking practice.

It has to start somewhere but perhaps I wasn\u2019t able to get this across but typically what I\u2019ve seen with vegans/vegetarians (going back to the broader term of voluntary restrictive diets) is it\u2019s treated as something you do as an individual\u2014as in, you may do it to further your individual values/morals but there isnt a follow through with talking about these issues, discussing and trying to remove the causes of what causes the hierarchy of animals being seen as lesser than humans or how specism affect other aspects of our lives (eg having pets). Also a huge one is I\u2019ve seen a lot of higher than thou attitudes from vegans which is especially concerning since not everyone has the ability to eat a voluntary restricted diet because of money, time (like OPs family), etc. So mainstream veganism lacks an intersectional understanding of this movement/diet. If you want to make change, why not volunteer with organizations that focus on animal rights, why not be a part of/start a targeted boycott or join an organization that provides vegetarian/vegan food for those who can't afford meals. You know, like looking at that united front aspect\u2014meeting with others that have a larger reach than the individual. You don't have to be a whole nation to push something forward but you should find people with similar goals and values and ensure that your movement actively works to improve and uphold the movement. A movement is never carried out by one person but by a group of people who have a defined idea of what needs to be done to cause the change to happen. \n\nAlso not gonna lie, a lot of this vegan stuff, it cares about the ethics of relating to animal rights but not human rights and the environment. The crops that are popular in N America heavily influence monoculture in countries in the Global South (I suggest looking up avocados or soy for more).

Like if that could be the first two or three lessons, great, and then after you can go about learning the language like normal.
