But ask and you shall receive! \n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nSo when you practice translating from the target language into English, you are only learning to ***recognise*** the meaning of words or phrases. Think about people (heritage speakers) who say they can 'understand their parent's language but can't speak it.' They only have this ability of recognition.\n\nNow when you translate from English into your target language, you are effectively learning to ***produce*** your target language from the top of your head. You are recalling vocabulary and with phrases you are practicing how to use them with the correct grammar. This is that crucial speaking component that many heritage speakers lack. \n\nBeing able to recognise what a french word means does not guarantee that you can produce it when you need it. I frustratingly learned this myself a thousand times over through trial and error. However, being able to produce a word (via translating from English -> French) *always* means you understand it, because you just translated from an English word you already understand! You are getting a 2-in-1 combo just doing English to French translation!\n\nDoes this mean that translating from the target language back into English is not useful? Of course not. But it is significantly less efficient than Native > Target. \n\nNow think of the time investment you have to put in to language learning. Don't you want to learn as quickly as possible in a way that is still completely effective? I know I do. I don't have that much free time to dedicate to language learning per day, and what I do have I split up between multiple different languages. With this in mind I want all my learning to be as efficient and effective as possible. \n\nSo here's my options:\n\n1) Choose  option A, with no guarantee of also getting 100% of option B\n\n2) Choose option B that gives you 100% of option A as a byproduct anyway\n\n3) Choose both A & B, which is double the time double the effort double the work!\n\nMy choice is pretty obviously B. If you have the time and commitment to do both then go wild. But as a busy person I'm happy just to get the most bang for my buck and I already know through experience that I'm really not losing out on anything by doing so.

So here's my recommendation.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n1. Do Michel Thomas (2-3 weeks depending on daily pace) - mp3s easily found online. Do Foundation > Advanced > Language Builder > Vocabulary. This course is a grammar book in audio format. Super easy learning. You'll be A1 by the end of it.\n2. Assimil. Do 'New French with Ease' (100 days) then the Advanced book (70 days). Use anki flashcards and log every word and phrase you learn with its english translation. Revise your flashcards everyday (Translate English into French, don't bother the other way if you value your time). You will be A2 by this point, possibly bordering on B1. That's pretty much the level you're asking for.\n3. Practice practice practice. Find a native speaker (not your SO) like a teacher on italki to converse with. Watch the Easy French series on YT and use it the same way you would Assimil. Find some french shows on netflix and use a chrome extension that gives you subtitles in two languages. As a recommendation, Les Beaux Malaises is a fantastic quebecois sitcom with tonnes of modern Quebec-isms. Just increase exposure.\n\n**This is the** ***exact*** **method I used to become conversational in French, and the same approach I am using for Spanish and Portuguese.** There are other courses and some people don't like Michel Thomas and Assimil, but there's no doubting they're actually very efficient learning tools (so long as you continue to revise them using your anki flashcards that you made along the way, revision of what you've learnt so it sticks is like 75% of language learning).\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nNow that you are here you only need to increase your vocabulary, usage and actual exposure to the language in order to improve, so do that along with your consistent practice. That is all anyone has to do to go from conversational to B2+ fluent.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nWord of advice.\n\nYes you have your partner there to help, but from experience I can say it will begin to annoy them constantly asking for help. My SO from Le Mans (who originally loved my efforts to learn) even asked me after a while if I was only dating her because she was french considering the amount of language and culture questions I was asking. They want to be your SO not your teacher. Start talking to them more in French once you're at least A2 when you've mastered the basics, so the level of annoying is more 'what does that uncommon word you said mean?' and not 'what's the difference between le, y, and en?' like they're a grammar teacher.\n\nP.S. the difference between French from France and from Quebec is not so different that you need to learn using different resources. 99% of courses are French from France, so just use them. By the time you are A2 you will be able to distinguish the differences fairly intuitively and you can use Quebec TV shows/youtube/any media to learn le joual (slang).", "created_utc": "1609126981.0", "edited": "False", "id": "gh97m6g", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_kle363", "parent_id": "t3_kle363", "score": "27", "subreddit": "French", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rd5t"}, {"author": "Aurazai", "body": "For some strange reason I just thought commentators knew these things off the top of their head as if they were all trivia geniuses, like The Beast on a football version of the Chase.

I'm on gear also but for vanity reasons, not to compete.\n\nSo the thing with steroids is that strength really doesn't go away off cycle the way many people think. Unless you've got unreal strength numbers beyond what is capable naturally (which basically no one in crossfit does) or you drastically cut weight after, you'll maintain most of what you gain. In my experience coming off of a basic test cycle, my squat PR of 200kg/440lb for 5 reps dropped to 2 reps after about 3-4 weeks. So you can see from that, it's really not a massive drop.\n\nNow with Kara, she has always been one of the strongest female athletes at the games long before her pregnancy, so the primary reason for Kara to use steroids or SARMs (strength and muscle mass) isn't really there. She already has adequate strength for all her competitive needs and so she really only has to focus on maintaining that whilst building her aerobic engine.\n\nSo really for her, she could do that with minimal to no PED use. But of course keep in mind that doesn't discount any previous use to get her strength to that level in the first place. There are also compounds for cardiovascular performance (e.g. Lance Armstrong's favourite drug of choice Erythropoietin (EPO), or a very popular drug in crossfit used by the likes of Ricky Garard GW-501516) but they are both extremely dangerous and I imagine a pregnant/breastfeeding athlete wouldn't take that risk.\n\nThere's a lot of broscience and bullshit in the PED world but if you want to learn more I think the r/steroids wiki is the highest rated source of information out there. r/steroidsxx is also there for the women side of things. Again I'm really just speculating, for all I know Kara Saunders could easily be natural and personally I still believe there are many games athletes who are also.

They're not going to destroy the male and female faces of their own brand and destroy their integrity as a sport for the sake of morality. Ricky Garard was used as the sacrificial lamb so they could say that they do bust top athletes, but in reality he was a rookie and had no skin in the game. At the end of the day it's a business with a pro sport marketing hustle. They have to protect the business.\n\nOnce you have the guarantee that you'll never be busted by the top brass, you basically have free reign to dope year round on any dosage. Meanwhile many of their competitors have to carefully schedule their protocols around testing during competitions as well as random testing (games athletes are informed by email which months they are subject to random testing). They also have free reign compared to the other athletes as to what types of compounds they can use, as certain drugs are detectable in the body for months whilst others can be completely cleared within 48 hours.\n\nSo essentially, even though we can be assured that many of the athletes are not natural, Mat and Tia (and maybe a handful of others like Katrin for example) have a lot more freedom than others when it comes to PED usage and that is what helps give them the edge in an already dirty playing field. Again this is just my theory and this isn't to take away from what they've accomplished, they're still super athletes with immense levels of dedication coupled with top tier training and the necessary diet for their lifestyle and recovery.

I also took French at University, and the absolute beginner track didn't get to this level until the end of two semesters (104 class room hours - 4x a week, 13 weeks per sem, 2 semesters).\n\nYou learn more vocabulary at university (kitchen utensils, clothing items, fairly arbitrary stuff) than with MT, but the grammar level is the same and Michel Thomas teaches languages with in my personal opinion, a phenomenally better method. Plus the cost (if you pay for it, arrr) is much cheaper than university classes for the same level of instruction, in a faster time.\n\nTake that value (time + money + content learned) for what you will.\n\nConsider my experience for what you will as well, but I think it's a bit rich to say that the course in your words, is a \"fucking scam\" if you've never used it and can't measure its value. Particularly as your only criticism is its marketing tagline, when practically every language course embellishes the level attainable with it. Build a bridge and get over it, marketing is and has always been marketing. My favourite course for example is Assimil, and these guys push hard with \"get to B2\" when their courses at best leave a learner who has memorised every line at B1, and the rest at A2.\n\nObviously there exists no program that will get you to 'fluency'.\n\nThat being said, MT is the perfect A1 beginner course in my opinion. You learn what you would at university in 1/4 of the time commitment, no textbooks, no homework, just audio.

I can vouch for French and Spanish, they're great. However, programs for the other languages have more mixed to negative reviews.\n\n(2) Michel Thomas doesn't have a native accent in any of the courses he teaches (the one's I listed above). Good pronunciation, but a heavy accent. Don't copy it and you'll be fine.\n\n(3) For Spanish beginners, use Language Transfer (free) instead. It's a superior course that uses almost the exact same method. For French, German, Italian - Michel Thomas still holds up well.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOne last thing is that most of the courses are available *elsewhere* for you (us) cheap bastards.

You get to hear real french being spoken casually (i.e. lots of slang and sayings!) with a range of different accents. Definitely not beginner material, although it does start out quite simple in the first few videos. \n\nEach video is about 5 minutes in length with both English and French subtitles on screen, so easy to follow along. Given the length, you can generally go through them quite quickly but I tend to be pausing a lot and replaying, as well as scribbling down new vocabulary to add to anki. I don't think there's been a single video where I haven't encountered a new word or phrase.\n\nIt's an awesome free resource. They also have 180+ videos of the same style for German and 50+ for Spanish if anyone else is learning those languages.\n\n**German:** https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3936178A38BB5F87\n\n**Spanish:** https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLA5UIoabheFMo9oB_AF7JftV34ecOalvM", "created_utc": "1487438544.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ddwp2ii", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_5urqz3", "parent_id": "t3_5urqz3", "score": "5", "subreddit": "French", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rd5t"}, {"author": "Aurazai", "body": "He's blond, he's pissed, he'll see you in the lists, LICHTENSTEIN!
