Sleeping 12-14 hours a day and living off Mr Noodles is, apparently, not a healthy lifestyle.\n\nOver Christmas I went home and met the afore mentioned friend for coffee. We inevitably ended up chatting about how miserable I seemed and he immediately suggested jiujitsu. He told me about a gym I had to look up when I got back to Quebec and even gave me one of the gis he was no longer using. I got back on a Saturday and mustered up the courage to walk in the gym doors that Wednesday. It was one of the best hours of my life--I signed up on the spot. The first few weeks, I'd leave the gym in tears because I'd come down from that high back into my depressed mind.

I had been diagnosed with major depression disorder at the beginning of my undergrad, but I had it under control with medication and sports, soccer and hockey. \n\n\nI finished my undergrad and started a master's degree in September of 2013, which is where things went down hill.

My French is poor, I didn't know anyone in the city, I had just broken up with my partner of five years, and the stress of grad school was slowly eating me away. No family in town, no friends to speak of, and I wasn't doing any sports or going to the gym.\n\n\nOver Christmas I went home and met the afore mentioned friend for coffee. We inevitably ended up chatting about how miserable I seemed and he immediately suggested jiujitsu. He told me about a gym I had to look up when I got back to Quebec and even gave me one of the gis he was no longer using. I got back to Quebec on a Saturday and mustered up the courage to walk in the gym doors at Gracie Barra Montreal that Wednesday. It was one of the best hours of my life--I signed up on the spot.\n\n\nOf course, I followed up with behavioural therapy and started working harder to make friends.

Nova Scotia, Canada but currently residing in Quebec, Canada\n\nWhy did you start training? I was really depressed and a friend recommended it to deal with my mental health issues.\n\nHow long have you been training for? 11 months, so not long at all\n\nWhat do your friends/family think about you training? They mostly are supportive\u2014most people know why I started and they\u2019re happy I\u2019m no longer a suicidal mess ;)\n\nHave you had to make any sacrifices to train? Hmmm, not really. I mean it costs money, which puts a dent in a student\u2019s budget, but I make ends meet. I don\u2019t consider it a sacrifice in terms of time, either, I enjoy the time I put in. Short answer: no, not yet.\n\nWhat belt are you? Ghostly white.\n\nDo you have any notable experiences? I just got silver in my first IBJJF tournament, but given there were only five women in my weight class\u2026 depends on how you define \u201cnotable\u201d I suppose. \n\nA/S/L? 23, female, Quebec\n\nWhat are your other hobbies? I don\u2019t have time for other hobbies: jiujitsu and school are my life. Although I just started watching Cosmos, is that a hobby? \n\nDo you consider yourself good? On the contrary\u2014I consider myself terrible at jiujitsu.\n\nWhat was your most embarrassing moment? Uhm, well at the aforementioned tournament my whole team watched as I failed to get out of my opponent\u2019s guard for the entire match\u2026 \n\nDo your friend train? I\u2019ve made friends through jiujitsu, but none of my school friends train.\n\nCould you describe the atmosphere of your gym? So awesome. Friendly, chill, welcoming. It\u2019s a great place to train.\n\nDo you use bjj as an escape? Absolutely. When I first started training it kept me going for a long time. At the beginning it was very much a way of getting out of my head. I\u2019d be on such a high that I\u2019d leave the gym and crash and call my mom in tears. \n\nHow much do you pay to train? 150 a month, Canadian\n\nWho were you growing up? A nerd? Jock? A mix. I was that quiet kid who was really good at sports, mildly social awkward, and definitely a nerd. I graduated top of my class in both high school and university.\n\nIs Bjj an art or a sport? It\u2019s both, but I feel that way about a lot of sports that aren\u2019t martial arts. Like hockey, for instance\u2014if you really watch it is amazingly beautiful. I think there\u2019s art in sport, for sure.\n\nHow do you feel about sports? I love sports. I\u2019ve always played them, always followed major events like the World Cup and the NHL. Go Canadiens! \n\nWhat are your goals? For jiujitsu, I\u2019m just focusing on baby steps. Be a better grappler tomorrow than I am today. I tend to set mini goals and big goals. At the moment my mini goals are: work on opening the guard (opening, not passing) and do squats more often to build my leg muscles because, now, it\u2019s hard to open while standing. Long term or \u2018big\u2019 goals: get my blue, compete in another tournament and medal. \n\nAnything else you think is relevant! I'm trying to give outsiders a glimpse or an overview of the bjj community.\n\nEdit:\n\nWhat is your job? Master\u2019s student (hopefully doctoral student in September, fingers crossed!)\n \nHas BJJ changed any other part of your life? I\u2019m no longer (as) depressed and I\u2019m definitely in better shape\u2014I stopped competitive sports during my undergrad.\n\nHow old are you? 23\n\nWhat do you like the most about bjj? Learning something completely new continues to be a great experience for me. I walked in knowing absolutely nothing. I\u2019m still learning and will for years to come, something I really value both in bjj and in life.", "created_utc": "1417489888.0", "edited": "False", "id": "cmiiwmq", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_2nzvdi", "parent_id": "t3_2nzvdi", "score": "4", "subreddit": "bjj", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qn02"}, {"author": "courtc8891", "body": "Haligonian checking in!
