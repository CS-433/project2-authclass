No one is perfect their second try and giving up immediately gets you nowhere. Anything worth it in the end will take hard work and dedication, and I don't know very many people who have gotten a poke on their very first try.\n\nAfter starting my first phlebotomy job I had a colleague with far more experience than me tell me to wait at least 6 months in to decide whether I want to leave, in other words, if I'm discouraged before then, I need to keep at it because nothing skilled is achieved quickly. You can't be prepared if you give up.\n\nMost of the people I started my real job with had absolutely no experience and they were all trained in one day and through experience. Since starting, I have had hard days that made me question life decisions, but days after that that made me happy to have chosen this field.
