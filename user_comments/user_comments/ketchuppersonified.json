Though I'm not yet diagnosed for ADHD (still on the assessment waitlist), yeah, I realized I've ADHD a year ago, and only a couple of weeks ago realized I've autism as well (on a waitlist too). They're very comorbid and both can often mask, and be in conflict with, each other. It's a wild mix.\n\nI realized I'm on the spectrum only recently because, just like you, I thought I didn't have the typical autistic traits, but it turns out I just didn't know much about autism. \n\nIt's such a wide spectrum that each symptom is on its own spectrum, so that means every autistic person will have different symptoms on different magnitudes! For example, I don't have the ones that are most typically presented on TikTok or talked about when autism is mentioned, I have the less visible ones, and this caused me to think I was neurotypical for 22 years. So it is definitely possible that it's similar for you.\n\nThe things you described very much sound like it could be autism. I also wouldn't engage that much with kids in kindergarten cause I didn't understand them; had plenty of meltdowns as a child; didn't have a set group of friends either!! I explained it to myself as 'oh I'm just so flexible that I can vibe anywhere', but it was just because I couldn't fit in with any of them; same goes for getting along with people fine, but having trouble with finding close friends; also very logical. All these are traits of autism.\n\nIn regard to the autistic traits you mentioned you don't have, I don't have any food texture issues nor stim either. I'm not that sensitive to clothes, but until recently, I had thought I didn't have clothes texture issues, and lately, I've realized they can present in different ways. For example, I could never sit in jeans at home, it just feels so uncomfortable and unnecessary, yet, other people do it and find it okay. Same goes for traveling, especially by plane; I'm always in sweatpants and a loose sweatshirt, but I always see most people traveling in jeans, open sandals, spaghetti strap crop tops, skirts, heels. I don't know how they don't see anything uncomfortable about these when they choose their outfit at home.\n\nOnly things I have different from what you've mentioned is that loud noises really piss me off and I constantly have new hyperfixations.\n\nI doubted I had autism for a year literally just because of the same things you mentioned\u2014no stimming, no clothes/food texture stuff. + I don't have any sensory issues apart from from sounds. So, yeah, you certainly sound like you might be on the spectrum; I literally didn't think I'd meet anyone else who suspects they have it, but don't have the \"main\" symptoms, so thanks for posting this!\n\nThis comment came out so chaotic cause I'm also writing on a phone and had to be constantly coming back to the post to see what I forgot about, but I hope it was useful.
