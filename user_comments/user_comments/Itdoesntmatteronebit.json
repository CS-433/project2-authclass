This is maybe why you've plateau'd at a reasonably high level. Progress becomes incremental and unexciting, but you have to push through it. If you missed something, go back and re-watch/listen until you catch it. It's really the only way. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n> I've been stuck for so long because there's just too many resources out there that are overlapping with no organization. \n\nTotally hear you. These books are a godsend. No bullshit, and very thorough, and adapted to each level. They have vocab ones too which are decent but their grammar books are truly exceptional. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>So my plan right now is to just go through these books first. Would probably take me 2-3 months? Then listen everyday to InnerFrench podcasts until I can completely understand everything without effort. I would probably write about the episode and share it to a native speaker in a french learning discord group or HelloTalk then talk to them about it.\n\nJust depends on how much time you have. I think I used to do a few chapters a week from the grammar book. I listened to InnerFrench and a few others (French Expat Le Podcast is good because the subjects are never too strange and they speak clearly) until it was boring, then moved on and started over (that is, rewinding when I missed stuff, etc.). At this stage, youtube and netflix is great because you can watch without subtitles, then if you miss something turn then on, and then turn them back off and watch the same part again to train your hear. I must have watched Dix Pour Cent 5 or 6 times all the way through this way. \n\nWriting more is an excellent idea and something I recommend a lot. Pick something random and write a few hundred words about it + also your idea of summarizing what you've listened to or read.\n\nI wouldn't get tied up in \"months\" or \"weeks\" or even \"years\". Just track your hours if you really want to and understand that from B2 to C2 will take a few hundred dedicated practice hours at least. An at your level, progress feels slow, so it becomes more about discipline than motivation. But then one day you're just listening to French podcasts on your daily walk or having a conversation with a neighbor about the local mayoral race and you realize it's worth it.\n\nBest of luck!

Do you read novels that takes you days or weeks to finish or do you tend to stick with shorter literature so you can go through more? Do you just keep reading or do you check the dictionary every so often to understand everything?\n\nI read an hour a day in the morning, and looked up every work I didn't know. I made no effort after the fact to memorize it. If it kept coming up, I eventually learned it by heart. I chose a variety of books - sci-fi, literature, current events, etc. It can be a slog depending on what you're reading.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Same question for podcasts, what constitutes a good listen? For B2/C1, should you be content understanding the gist of it or should u be aiming to understand for 70-80% perhaps more?\n\nYour understanding should be way above 70-80%. Otherwise it's exhausting and not fun. I never really measured or even tried to estimate, but it's pretty rare I miss something. You should be listening at a level where when you do, you can clearly hear what it was, and pause and look it up. If you're missing entire thoughts or sentences, you should go down a level. InnerFrench is a great one if this is the case. Or just pick an excerpt of a few minutes, and spend as much time as needed going through it slowly to hear everything. Adjust the speed, go back and re-listen, etc. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso treat this as the exercise that it is - often people at the intermediate level try to listen to podcasts while they're doing something else and then are surprised after a couple hundred hours why they're listening has not improved. If you can't catch everything listening passively you need to work on it more. Put on some headphones and sit at a table and treat it like any other exercise. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Finally for grammar, do you do any exercises or do you just learn what they are and move on? What book(s) do you use for grammar? What other free online resources were there that you found helpful?\n\nThis whole series is excellent.

This needs to be more widely known because years ago I thought the same about C2 - that's it's essentially native level, maybe even better. Bit shocking to realize where I am now. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>When some learners say, \"C2 is too much,\" I think, \"Huh? C2--or maybe C1+--is the minimum for functioning and being treated as a normal adult in society; I don't know what people are talking about. It is far from overkill.\"\n\nWow thank you! Totally agree and I thought I was taking crazy pills whenever I see on here \"no no, B1 is fine, you're fluent, move on to the next language!\" I mean if that's your goal fine, there's nothing wrong with it, but there's *no way* I could function in France entirely in French and not be miserable all the time at B1. I know because I was there not too long ago and it sucks. You feel like a 5 year old. Or worse - you feel like someone who came out of a coma. You know what you're saying is garbage, but you don't know any better way to say it, so you basically feel stupid all the time.", "created_utc": "1654232508.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ib04n6z", "is_submitter": "True", "link_id": "t3_v3esd2", "parent_id": "t1_iayqjfl", "score": "11", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "Itdoesntmatteronebit", "body": "Hah no worries - we actually met on Tandem! Strictly platonic at first, and then we texted a bit, sometimes in English sometimes in French, but we both struggled a lot and it took a long time to write something intelligible. We settled on French and it got better over time. I never actively flirted - nor could I in French. The friendship turned into a romantic relationship pretty organically. We learned we had a lot in common, and of course moving to France made it easier to see if we could work as a couple, which thankfully, it did. \n\nA huge fear of mine, and thus a huge motivating factor, is not being able to fully express myself to her in French. It's why other languages don't interest me. I want her to know me as much as possible, and that means being able to express myself as fluently as possible. Sarcasm, degrees of intensity, flowery language, etc. All of it. \n\nIn couples like yours and mine, someone has to make an initial sacrifice, typically the person whose second language is best. Hopefully that person eventually becomes nearly bilingual and there are no further issues. What I really don't understand is couples where one person never progresses past A2 or B1.
