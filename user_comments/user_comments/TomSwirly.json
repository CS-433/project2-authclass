I eventually stopped doing music for exactly the same reasons, and I was in a market where you could potentially be a professional musician. The last show I did, I didn't even get a drink ticket as compensation, so I felt I was doing the right thing. I do do sound design for people sometimes, just for fun.\n\nWhat happened was that all the fun got taken out of music because all the money got taken away from musicians. When I first started, you could show up with your very weird band, do a couple of sets without a huge audience, and still take home $200, which in the early 90s was actual money. If you were a headliner on the weekend, you could take home a couple of thousand as a local band. If you could do that just five times a month, you could live off your earnings. \n\nUnfortunately, several things happened: the biggest one was the explosion in real estate prices, that meant a club that wasn't grinding their musicians was going to go out of business. Almost as big with the rise of the DJ, and I believe the two went hand-in-hand. There was a three-year period where whenever we started to play regularly in a club, it would move to pre-recorded music only.\n\nAnd cell phones. Remember the first time I saw someone looking at his cell phone while I was playing and I thought nothing of it. Had I known, I would've gotten off stage and destroyed the cell phone right then, ha ha ha, not really but still.\n\nIf people don't like your music, they immediately start looking at their phone, but if they do you like your music they hold up their phone in front of their faces to record you but I don't think they're actually listening.\n\nI have an old friend who would show up to a lot of gigs. One time, after a show, he said, \"Oh, I noticed a bit of Stravinsky in a solo,\" and I said, \"I did it for you, Steve, because I knew you would be listening!\"\n\nOne of the awful consequences I saw as an avid concert goer was that we would stop seeing good bands come back. Used to be that touring bands would come back over and over again, because it was steady money. When the money dropped out, you had to tour just for the fun of it, but it turns out touring and losing money isn't any fun really, not after the first time.\n\nWhat I have seen revitalize musicians in the past is a new collaboration, or a new project that you are hopeful for.  Artists with a huge amount of recorded material do quite well these days, because once someone has bought one of your tracks, they will just continue to buy your tracks through habit.

We've lost 70% of animal populations in the last 50 years - [source](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/oct/13/almost-70-of-animal-populations-wiped-out-since-1970-report-reveals-aoe).\n\nInsect populations have been particularly hard-hit:\n\nhttps://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2022/02/24/1082752634/the-insect-crisis-oliver-milman\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decline_in_insect_populations\n\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/feb/10/plummeting-insect-numbers-threaten-collapse-of-nature\n\n----\n\nAnd yet you \"assume\" it's to do with aerodynamics, because your gas-guzzling world destroyer didn't get insect hits?\n\nHere's what the article you didn't read says about this:\n\n> Many smart people we spoke with, including entomologists and wheat farmers, speculated that maybe the cars have changed, not the bugs. As vehicles become more aerodynamic, the thinking goes, their increasingly efficient airflow whisks the bugs away from the windshield instead of creating head-on splatters.\n\n> But when we called experts in the arcane art of computational fluid dynamics, they sounded skeptical. Yes, today\u2019s sleek sedans can have half the drag of the land boats that ruled the road just a generation or two ago. But that improved airflow won\u2019t do much for a bug.\n\n> For starters, many aero improvements happen on the rear of the car rather than the bug-hitting front. Consider the optimally aerodynamic teardrop shape, with its blunt, round front and long, sleek tail. But more importantly, it\u2019s just surprisingly difficult to use air to push a bug out of the way of an onrushing Buick.\n\n> If it were possible to design a bug- and debris-proof car, then Kevin Golsch probably would have done it by now. An auto-industry veteran, Golsch has spent decades around wind tunnels, both real and simulated, and is now vice president for strategic fluid design and simulation at Altair, a global tech company that makes simulation and AI software. Altair\u2019s customers include massive automakers that would be thrilled if airflow could protect both windshields and the delicate sensors on self-driving cars.\n\n> \u201cFrom an aerodynamic standpoint, I\u2019ve done a lot of studies on contamination of sensors, especially for autonomous vehicles,\u201d Golsch said. \u201cAnd I think most everybody\u2019s given up on trying to influence what happens at the vehicle level for dust and particles and rain.\u201d\n\n> Consider raindrops. They\u2019re about the size and weight of a larger insect, but nobody thinks fewer raindrops hit our windshields these days. Any forces that cleared our windshield of bugs would presumably do the same for rain and road debris, Golsch said.\n\n----\n\nYour posting history shows you are a political conservative, though to your credit, a seemingly compassionate person.

You don't have to listen to some clever drummer or bassist: there is a strictly repeating, metronomic rhythm line.  You don't have musically complicated things like bridges, modulations, crescendos, or accelerandos.  Everything is in 4/4. There really isn't a tune in many cases \u2013 the lyrics are spoken.\n\nA lot of it is that there is just too much entertainment of too many different types. 50 years ago, if you wanted to see a movie, you had to wait till it showed up in the cinema or on TV. Video games did not exist, and once they did exist, they were expensive, and did not have the ultra long play of today's video game series.\n\nSo we became music experts. It was really the only medium that we had on demand. Even then it was dramatically restricted because you had to buy it, or at least tape it in real time from your friend. \n\nIt's hard to believe but when someone in your group got a new record, you got together, and listened to the whole record uninterrupted like you were watching a film.  The side change was when you would get another drink or go to the bathroom, and then you'd be right back into the music again.\n\nThat seems to have basically vanished. Even my contemporaries now timeshare. I had a friend who was constantly running music, and BBC news, and will watch videos at the same time.\n\nToday we simply have too many ways to spend our leisure time. Reddit is a perfect example.

That is not lunacy - it is despair.\n\nThe lunatics are the people like you who somehow believe that if we sit down and have yet another nuanced discussion it will somehow work in a way that the last 50 years of nuanced discussions have completely failed to work. \n\nBut don't worry!  You will certainly win!  We will continue to have nuanced discussions, and discourage anyone doing anything that might bother anyone.  We will burn all the fossil fuels we can easily get, and boost the temperature by +5\u00ba and then you can proudly say, \"It's a shame about all those species, and all those humans, but we kept the moral high ground, and that's what's most important!  We may have lost the biosphere, but we didn't lose our cool.\"\n\nCongratulations!

This is wildly false.\n\nI have been telling this joke for 30 years now: weeks of programming can save you hours of planning. This is just as true in agile as any other methodology.\n\nDesign documents simply need to be deliverables like anything else and be budgeted for.  Design documents should be as light as possible but no lighter - there needs to be enough information that another engineer could immediately figure out exactly what you were planning to do, and enough to convince you, the writer, that there aren't going to be any hangups, and little more than that.  One or two pages is usually enough, if they are the right pages.\n\nDetails are only necessary if they are potential blockers, but then they are _really_ necessary. The key idea behind the agile design document is not to explain the easy parts, but to sketch them as lightly as possible, and just as important, identify the difficult parts, the risks, and the unknowns.\n\n----\n\nStand ups should be brutally short.  You need a fun way to reward people for not talking at all in a stand up!  You should talk if you are stuck, if you need to get information from the group, or if you have new \"emergency\" information you need to immediately give the group. \n\nIf things are going well or even just OK, then most people really should have nothing to say. People talk because they feel they will be judged negatively if they are silent, and they look for something to contribute. Convince them that being silent is good, and you can have a lot of two-minute standups.\n\nWhat I do is to go through the practical stuff as quickly as I can, and then say, \"The standup is over, you can stay if you like\", and then we socialize and catch up on personal details, or leave, perfectly OK.\n\nPresenting work, or brainstorming future designs, or really anything that isn't an immediate emergency, has no place at stand up! Schedule a short meeting for those separately, with just the right people.\n\n-----\n\nAgile should involve a lot less total time in meetings, but somewhat more meetings. What that means is short meetings, targeted meetings on exactly one specific topic, scheduled short meetings with only a small number of people, quick unplanned 5-minute meetings to resolve an immediate blocker.\n\nImportant of course to respect people's need for long, completely uninterrupted blocks of time just to program and design and study.

Forget about the animals' welfare, we are killing our shared ecosystem with our emissions, and stopping meat and dairy is by far the fastest and most immediate way for an individual to lower their CO2 footprint _and_ to send a financial message to industry that they are willing to change their lives to change the world.\n\nA person who eats meat in 2022 is a _bad environmentalist_.

There are plenty of ways you can make animal agriculture **less** environmentally damaging.\"\n\n\"Are CAFOs awful? Yes, for many reasons. Does animal agriculture require massive amounts of water while also creating significant methane emissions and groundwater problems? Without a doubt. Does Big Ag lobby governments in heinous ways similar to how Big Oil does? You bet. Are there 55 million other issues with this I\u2019m glossing over that illustrate this further? Mhmm.\n\n\"Can you **address** these each and every one of issues with the intent of making the environment not be as abused in the process? Absolutely.\"\n\nEvery statement there is true.\n\nBut \"less\" is a weasel word\".  \"Less environmentally damaging\" is how much less?  Less than what?  \"Less\" is desirable in proportion to _how much_ less.\n\n\"Address\" is also a weasel word.  We are \"addressing\" the problem of the environment right now.\n\nWe have been \"addressing\" all these issues all my life, and all sorts of processes have become \"less\" environmentally damaging, but as I pointed out, we have overall completely and utterly lost on almost every single front (yes, except chlorofluorocarbons, and that was because this wasn't a huge part of our economy and because there were cheap alternatives available).\n\nHow much would you realistically reduce the emissions of meat with your \"less addresses\"? 5%? 10%?  Beef is the worst, and more popular every day.\n\nRemember, also, that the mitigation efforts you want to spend on incredibly destructive meat farming _could be used on non-meat farming_.\n\n---\n\nTotal emissions grew by 6% in 2021, but we need to cut our emissions by 90% from a few years ago.\n\nNumbers are very varied about what would happen but at the most conservativer, we would lose 10%, gross, off the top, of our CO2 emissions by going vegan _en masse_, and some credible estimates are as high as 15%.\n\nImagine our CO2 budget is $1.  We need to live on less than $0.10.  But you are arguing for meat, which costs us at least $0.15.  You think you can cut it back, maybe to $0.12 _but it is still more than our whole budget_.\n\n---\n\nYou know, by now, no one who has a clue rationally thinks we're getting out of this mess.  We're going to shoot the fucking moon here, and we all know it.  We won't even take our foot off the accelerator.\n\nProfessionals like you will refuse to pull the fire alarm, governments will prioritize \"jobs\" all the way down, people will buy products with a green label and then fly and drive everywhere, Meatless Mondays!, and then we have the large portion of society who is emboldened by our spinelessness and actively claims that all science is a hoax.\n\nToday, no-one except a few historians thinks much about the past on a day-to-day basis but our descendants for the rest of time will be forced to think _every single day_ about us,  how we ran through an incredible wealth of chemical and energetic resources and even destroyed the biosphere - for Happy Meals and suburbia and endless wars based on lies.\n\nIt's by far the worst crime in history, considering it will negatively affect all humans forever.  We are literally transforming our planet into garbage, at an exponentially increasing rate.  Our descendants will live in our filth.\n\nAnd you, with your compensated message of tiny change, you are a part of the problem.\n\nImagine that I need to come up with $5,000 to save the Building and Loan, and you as the expert tell me, \"You should wander around town picking up pennies.\"\n\nMr. Potter is surely rubbing his hands together at the very thought, because this strategy is mathematically certain to fail.\n\nWe need the most drastic, dramatic action immediately.  \n\nYour call for moderation and tiny steps would have been reasonable in 1962, but in 2022, it's irresponsible and a mathematically certain path to doom.", "created_utc": "1664720762.0", "edited": "1664721447.0", "id": "iqr4cm7", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_xszm4q", "parent_id": "t1_iqqnp6h", "score": "2", "subreddit": "environment", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1n"}, {"author": "TomSwirly", "body": "> Clearly, tear gas shouldn't have been used.

This is emptiness!\n\n---\n\nSomehow with all this environmental cred, you act like you have no idea at all of the gravity of the problem.  \n\nHere are the numbers.\n\nThe Earth can absorb quite a lot of CO2 - perhaps as much as 3 gigatonnes a year.\n\nBut we emit 35 gigatonnes of CO2 a year.  And each gram of that captures light from the sun as heat energy - the greenhouse effect.\n\nEven just to keep the CO2 level stable, we will need to reduce our CO2 output by 90% within one generation.  That still commits us to disastrous levels of temperature rise of at least +2\u00baC, but our society can probably survive.\n\nThat means we need to reduce the CO2 by 90% in a generation.  90%.  Let that sink in for a bit.\n\nYou are talking about plans that would reduce CO2 output by a few percent - let's say, generously, 5%.  But we need to reduce by 90%.\n\nWe aren't going to get there by \"[improving meat] from [its] current state so as to lessen their environmental impact.\"  Radical, dramatic change is essential, and even then we are probably fucked.  \n\nYour tiny, unnoticeable steps are all we have done for generations, and that's why we have lost. \n\n---\n\n> I\u2019ve worked with groups like Sierra Club, NRDC, LCV, Audubon Society, and many other environmental advocacy groups that use my research when they work with members of Congress to shape environmental policy. \n\nThese old and respected groups exemplify the complete and total failure of the environmental movement to protect the environment.\n\nThe total budget of the Sierra Club, NRDC and the Audubon Society is over $400 million a year. The youngest of these groups is over 50 years old, so we have spent tens of billions of (inflation adjusted) dollars on them.  (I might note that the top three earners at NRDC collectively make over $1.3 million, and \"Audubon reports \"Bonus & incentive compensation\" payments to 13 individuals in calendar year 2019, including $527,500 and $50,000 paid to David M. Yarnold, President & CEO, and David J. O'Neill, Chief Conservation Officer, respectively.\")\n\nAnd yet in the last fifty years, we have emitted two-thirds of the carbon dioxide ever emitted by humans in history.  The annual emission of CO2 has tripled since the League of Conservation Voters was founded.  Obama was supported by all these groups, and yet he was [the best friend fossil fuels ever had.](https://archive.thinkprogress.org/obamas-worst-speech-ever-we-ve-added-enough-new-oil-and-gas-pipeline-to-encircle-the-earth-e5e24a156910/)\n\nThe last fifty years have been a disaster for the environment in every way.  Now we are moving toward catastrophe, and you guys are all, \"All we need is a few tweaks, and we're good to go.\"\n\nThese groups, and the environmental movement in general, have completely and utterly failed us.  Perhaps it's \"not their fault\" but it really makes no difference - the environmental movement has completely and utterly failed to prevent or even mitigate the exponential destruction of our biosphere.\n\nSaying that you have been paid good money to participate in this failure is not a flex. Being paid has rendered you utterly blind to the fact that you have completely failed to achieve anything at all.\n\n----\n\nDo I sound angry?  I am.  I am radioactive with rage.

You have too many code subdirectories - it makes it harder to read without organizing it really.  \n\n5. You use parens too often.

A lot of places don't use `logging` because using the `%` format is old and annoying.\n\n----\n\nNotes on 4:\n\nIn my very lengthy experience in programming -  almost fifty years, fscking hell! - there are two good ways to structure a project - either as hierarchical directories with \"three to seven\" items in most directories, or as one great big file.   (Three to seven is also the number of items you can keep in short term memory, FWIW.)\n\n(I see you start in surprise at the second one.  I personally almost never do this myself ([counterexample](https://github.com/rec/safer/blob/master/safer.py), but at the time it needed to be a single file with no dependencies - still, I haven't split it since, because it works well) but I see quite a lot of good code in a single file.\n\n(Still, after about 1000 lines that is folly.  You're on the border with this, but separate files is the choice I'd make.)\n\nIn your case, you are expecting one subdirectory, `runners/`, to grow.  Keep that.

For example, you make the move, and three weeks from now, you notice some anomaly in the database.  When did this come about?  If you have Postgres 10, you just fire it up and look at the backups.  If not, you just can't know before the current version.\n\nI love this idea because it means you don't have to have a hard switch.  In your case, you could literally be running the same database under 10 and 14 on different ports, and switch between them in your application program to compare.  It means an almost instant rollback is possible if something bad happens.\n\nMy life as a programmer is about cranking out code, but even more, reducing stress.
