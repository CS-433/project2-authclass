If you had forced 222, taking Brig or not would become a trade-off of how you value her toolset versus taking another support. If she's currently lacking potency in the off-healer role, her healing or other outputs can be increased without worry that it will make her broken in comps where she would be played as a DPS because that wouldn't be a thing anymore.

I imagine the effectiveness will depend on what your personal goals are and how you feel like you learn best. \n\nIf your goal is to learn stuff that is usable right away, that will get you the closest to reading *anything* fastest. I definitely think it makes sense to go for the most commonly used stuff earlier. Especially if you think that making that progress and being able to start reading will give you motivation to keep studying.\n\nOn the other hand, the goal of systems that try to teach you radicals and then progress you through kanji in a way where the previously learned material is built on in new material is to get you to the point where you're comfortable with a lot of kanji in the most time efficient manner possible. The downside of this is not as much of it may be immediately usable. You're laying your foundations for long term literacy but not learning so much easily usable Japanese now so if you give up halfway through you may end up with not much to show for your time.\n\nPersonally, I think that both approaches are valid and that there's no reason not to mix and match. If you're studying starting with common Japanese and you see a radical that's common across a couple of kanji that you're studying, maybe it'd be worth it to look that radical up and get familiar with it. If it has a semi-common usage as a word, make a card and add it to your flashcard deck. I'm not sure if knowing every exact meaning of every radical is as important as being familiar with them and just being able to recognize them if you've learned words with them before, so you can be like, \"Hey, I've seen this guy's parts before. This Kanji isn't so scary.\" Being able to recognize kanji as a combination of a couple components rather than a bunch of lines makes them less intimidating.

Breaking kanji down into manageable components and learning them in context in words is the key to grasping kanji.\n\nFor example, the word \u65e5\u672c\u8a9e contains the kanji \u8a9e. If you learn \u8a9e on its own you'll have to memorize a seemingly random pattern of 14 strokes. If however, you were able to recognize that \u8a9e was in fact composed of three other simpler kanji that you may already be familiar with (\u8a00\u3001\u4e94\u3001\u53e3), all you would have to remember is where those parts were in the bigger picture of that kanji to write or recognize it. As a bonus not only do the radicals make it easier for you to remember the shape of the kanji but they also give you hints to the meaning and pronunciation. \u8a00 has the meaning (words, say), \u53e3 (mouth) and \u4e94 is pronounced (go). So when you break it down into parts maybe it's not so surprising you get a word nihongo where \u8a9e means language and is pronounced go.\n\nNot sure if it's outdated or not but http://www.kanjidamage.com/ features the sort of approach I'm talking about.

While it may still be deadly in the right hands, the loss of guaranteed damage would raise his skill floor even further which I think we could all agree is the last thing that he needs.\n\nI *do* think that it would be okay to pair a new defensive ability with a new ability (or buff) to his current kit. Some very rough ideas that I've thought of are as follows:\n\n* Buffing (un-nerfing?) the hit-box size of his arrows \u2013 obvious buff to consistency in landing shots\n* Ability disabling arrow \u2013 Something along the lines of a Sombra hack that could open up the opposing team to frontal assault by disabling shields etc.\n* Heal debuff arrow \u2013 Something along the lines of an Ana bionade that could disable or impede healing. Could reward smart target selection where Hanzo could stop heals on critical targets.\n* Quickshot \u2013 An ability that shoots a fully charged arrow without the charge time. This could let Hanzo confirm a kill following up on a body shot or allow for a substantial amount of burst on a tank.\n* Impeding cloud arrow \u2013 Arrow that applies a reverse speed boost to an area that slows the movement speed of the players inside of it. Slowed players would be easier to hit with his normal attack and would also give some utility in delaying players in returning to the point.\n* Poison cloud arrow \u2013 An arrow that could apply a moderately heavy DoT in a cloud for area denial.

They are used to convey a meaning and often to break up a sentence. \n\nIt normally depends on the word whether or not people write it fully in hiragana, mixed with kanji, or in kanji only but in my experience \u65e5\u672c\u8a9e is generally written fully in kanji. \u8a9e carries the meaning of language so when readers see it they immediately know that you're talking about the Japanese language.\n\nIn regards to the breaking up of a sentence, If I wrote\u300c\u79c1\u306f\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e\u3092\u52c9\u5f37\u3059\u308b\u306e\u304c\u597d\u304d\u3067\u3059\u300d it's much easier to read than \u300c\u308f\u305f\u3057\u306f\u306b\u307b\u3093\u3054\u3092\u3079\u3093\u304d\u3087\u3046\u3059\u308b\u306e\u304c\u3059\u304d\u3067\u3059\u300dbecause your eyes can find the breaks in the words easier.

When you actually get down to speaking a foreign language you almost never have time to sit around and parse grammar in your head. By the time you get your grammar straight you've already missed your chance to speak. \n\nWhen we speak English we never have to think about grammar. We just use bits and pieces of sentences, grammatical patterns, that we picked up from different places and put them together into a new sentence. That should be your goal with a foreign language because that's the only where you're ever going to build up speed.\n\nSo like you said, learning patterns is key, but as far as language learning goes... you don't get patterns from grammar, you get them from listening and reading in your target language. \n\nYou don't have to know the rules of a programming language to use software, right? I think it's pretty similar.
