This articulated so well one of my big gripes with HP being uniformly recommended across the board for language learners.

I feel this has been to the detriment of discovering diverse, and equally meaningful, authors and stories.\n\nI understand the point the series being well-suited to learners because of its increasingly complex style, but could that effect could just as easily be achieved on your own, by selecting books that get progressively more difficult?
