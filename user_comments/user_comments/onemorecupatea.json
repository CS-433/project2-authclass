There is often times no balance between one's emotional investment and the risk of painful heartbreak. One might argue that even the pleasure of a successful relationship doesn't outweigh the possibility of massive heartbreak. \n\nIn the 21st century, most men and women can work and live independently. It's not like someone has to get married to be safe and secure with a roof over their head anymore.\n\nMovies, books and media have stuffed our head with romance since childhood. Especially in the age of tinder, tiktok and instant gratification it is presumably quite challenging to find a healthy partner to settle with.\n\nI don't want to be bitter but this is life. You either adapt, improve and find your way or you cry and nobody listens...nature removes you automatically. We can't change the society. At least not individually and short-term.\n\nI don't want to extremely stick to one side of the spectrum though. Relationships, dating, romantic, sexual and meaningful human connection are all beautiful things. And they are acquirable indeed. There are plenty of high-value people who are willing to be in the dating scene or a healthy relationship. As human beings our sole biological goal is to pass our genes after all (it could mean that dating isn't pointless). There are challenges on the way. Work on yourself, go dating in the right places with the right people, enjoy, have your doors open to possibilities and stay positive in your own skin.

Because I want natural feelings to flow in me. Because I want to not ejaculate for a certain period of time. Because a part of the journey is the willpower, the mental side of it, the struggle of holding myself and keeping myself busy with more important things in my life is helping me grow into a better person etc. etc. I do not know your lifestyle and *your* reasons of doing no fap.

But it is very easily manageable. It's not a monster to be slayed but a friendly Moomin you'll fall in love with. I have been learning Finnish for around a month or two now, and my suggestion is to learn them both parallel to each other. I think if I only focused on formal Finnish and gotten back to learn the spoken Finnish when I am at, say B2 level, it would seem like quite a tough task to master. But now that I am learning it side by side with the formal Finnish, the spoken language is becoming somewhat second nature and I can feel the \"weirdness\" of formal Finnish in speech. One of the resources I use is Glossika, there are spoken and formal versions written right next to each other (with the spoken pronunciation which is my favorite part about it). That way one can develop a hunch for the spoken language, I can already tell that it is becoming automatic in me naturally with not much effort. Suomen Mestari textbooks also have the spoken language part, but I found Glossika more helpful since it is more intensive and the pronunciation is very very natural as if you are hearing that in the streets of Finland. If you can find other sources for spoken language, I recommend you stick with them right from the start.\n\nhope that helps :)", "created_utc": "1658300535.0", "edited": "False", "id": "igvyn9c", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_w2zadc", "parent_id": "t3_w2zadc", "score": "9", "subreddit": "LearnFinnish", "subreddit_id": "t5_2xe7f"}, {"author": "onemorecupatea", "body": "Not gonna lie, your dreams have very cool background music", "created_utc": "1658252834.0", "edited": "False", "id": "igt13d8", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_w2sake", "parent_id": "t3_w2sake", "score": "13", "subreddit": "burdurland", "subreddit_id": "t5_yvsv4"}, {"author": "onemorecupatea", "body": "relationships", "created_utc": "1658252744.0", "edited": "False", "id": "igt0ukl", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_w2g3dz", "parent_id": "t3_w2g3dz", "score": "1", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i"}, {"author": "onemorecupatea", "body": "You can find a lot of Iranian movies on YouTube actually, just search them up by writing in Persian, something in the lines of:\n\n\\- \u0641\u06cc\u0644\u0645 \\[enter movie name here\\]\n\n\\- \u0641\u06cc\u0644\u0645 \u0627\u06cc\u0631\u0627\u0646\u06cc (Iranian movie)\n\n\\-\u0641\u06cc\u0644\u0645 \u06a9\u0645\u062f\u06cc \u0627\u06cc\u0631\u0627\u0646\u06cc (Iranian Comedy movie)\n\nThere's also an Iranian version of YouTube called Aparat.

As the others suggested I also think you should stay away from her.\n\nIt is easy to say for us, of course; but tough to implement at times. **However I say don't block her**. Leave a way back to yourself for her if you want her back. I find blocking as somewhat passive-aggressive and it might scare her off that you have totally moved on and never want her again (or as if she has affected you negatively so much so easily). You made your stance, you are interested in romance and nothing less with this girl that you have a meaningful beautiful connection with (which she's apparently not respecting). If she changes her mind, you are open to take things back with her one step at a time. If she doesn't, you'll have a great life on your own.\n\nHere's a clich\u00e9 phrase but it's true: I'd say work on yourself, hit the gym, learn a language, do the project you always wanted to do but didn't have the chance to, learn something you're interested in; once she reaches out she'll see that you improved yourself and her rejection did not move you out of the path of your goals. In one of my previous breakups I learned how to DJ from the web. This summer I'm dating a girl who keeps going hot and cold on me which is pissing me off as well, we're away for a while and now I'm working on singing and learning Finnish. Not because I want to impress her. But because I want to show myself love and follow my ambitions. You should do the same my friend. You haven't done anything wrong to be fixed by texting her. She bailed and she's got to make the first step back towards you. Personally, as a man I would feel inferior and worthless if I **initiate** texting someone who bailed on me like that.\n\nI'm no expert but I hope I could be of help. I know how stressful it can be.\n\n***Stay Strong :)***", "created_utc": "1658128435.0", "edited": "False", "id": "igm5t4q", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_w1fhai", "parent_id": "t3_w1fhai", "score": "1", "subreddit": "dating_advice", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s4kl"}]
