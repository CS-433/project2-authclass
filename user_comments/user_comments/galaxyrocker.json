And lots of 'new speaker' researchers who, in my opinion, actively try to delegimitise native Irish (and those who focus on learning it) for that of learners. Irish sociolinguistics is, in my opinion, entirely toxic, and Gaelic is going that way too, especially recently (and for the same reasons).\n\n> And so the main organizations aren't really focused on trying to preserve intergenerational transmission in the Gaeltachts? \n\nSadly not, at least from my experience. They might say they are, and try, but they're really more focused on trying to increase the number of learners with passable 'Irish', and not doing much to stem the tide. Even the one created for it, \u00dad\u00e1ras na Gaeltachta, was basically co-opted during the austerity years (they removed direct elections of the people in charge by Gaeltacht residents) to become a 'yes-man' for the government to promote tourism there, essentially (again, my views on the matter; they'll certainly argue otherwise), even if native speakers still work there and are on the board.\n\n/u/material-ad-5540 might be able to give more explicit details and references than I can off the top of my head if you're interested.", "created_utc": "1666886835.0", "edited": "False", "id": "iu062d8", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_yem95s", "parent_id": "t1_iu051hp", "score": "3", "subreddit": "linguistics", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhos"}, {"author": "galaxyrocker", "body": "> What are the kinds of comments people say about native pronunciation? \n\nThe common one usually goes along the lines of 'Why would I want to sound like a 100 year old fishwife from Conamara?' It often gets trotted out when someone mentions it's /x(')/ not /k(')/ or that broad/slender consonants do exist, or that it's *not* 'Gwaylga'.\n\nBut there's lots of that attitude that associates native pronunciation with poverty and being 'backwards', and it's spreading sadly as Gaelscoils become more popular and 'Gaelscoilis' (or 'English in Irish drag' as one linguist once put it) gets associated with the upper middle class. This is happening even in the Gaetlachts, from some papers I've read.\n\n> I understand a lot of the main Irish-speaking media is dominated by L2 speakers. Would someone from the Gaeltacht have a hard time like being hired for an Irish-language radio show? Would their accent seem really out of place?\n\nSo it's...weird. In the Republic, the main Irish language radio station, Raidi\u00f3 na Gaeltachta, is pretty much native-only, though there are more and more non-natives (of varying quality) getting shows. Outside of that, quality is usually atrocious. Nuacht TG4 is decent, in their hosts and reporters (though the people they interview have varying qualities of Irish), but the two 'hip' radio stations, Raidi\u00f3 na Life and Raidi\u00f3 R\u00ed-R\u00e1 are generally just awful. A native speaker would sound out of place there, in my opinion. And most popular 'influencers' are non-natives, though at least a few of them focus on native pronunciation (the others adopt the 'My English came from Irish so they're the same and it's just my dialect' excuse). That said, Raidi\u00f3 Life does have some native speaker podcasts shows, at least.\n\nRaidi\u00f3 F\u00e1ilte, up in Belfast, is hit or miss. Some speakers are really good, some aren't. But a native accent would be less out of place there than, say, on Raidi\u00f3 Life or Raidi\u00f3 R\u00ed-R\u00e1.\n\n\nAs for the main organization promoting Irish, Conradh na Gaeilge, it's run by non-natives and worries more about promoting Irish in middle class Dublin than it does in the actual Gaeltachts (and this has been the case since it was founded over 100 years ago!) The head of it has horribly anglicised pronunciation, as do most others who work there and with it (there are some Gaeltachat ones, however). Their teachers are also very low quality of pronunciation (as are most in Dublin, even at professional Irish-teaching/promoting organisations)\n\nBut that got a bit away from your question, sorry for my rant; it's a huge issue in the future of Irish (and it runs a lot deeper than just pronunciation), and my biggest pet peeve with everything, as there's a lot of people who say 'Any 'Irish' is good Irish' (even if it's basically coded English).", "created_utc": "1666885395.0", "edited": "False", "id": "iu02dsx", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_yem95s", "parent_id": "t1_iu00iut", "score": "6", "subreddit": "linguistics", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhos"}, {"author": "galaxyrocker", "body": "We will only allow links to the first as the others often violate copyright law and can get reddit called down on us if it gets too widespread.", "created_utc": "1666884223.0", "edited": "False", "id": "itzzdrt", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_yep2fc", "parent_id": "t1_itzfy6q", "score": "37", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "galaxyrocker", "body": "Hello, u/Oxideblack, and thank you for posting on r/languagelearning.

That is, English conceives of arguments as being a war, and that affects how we think about and conceive arguments.\n\n*This* is what's being lost in minority languages, as emphasized in the quote from *Endangered Metaphors* I shared. What is happening is *direct* importation from the majority languages, which also imports the conceptual/semantic system of the majority language. Sure, the words might be the same, but the underlying semantics of the language *are not*; they're those of the majority language.\n\nI'd argue that's a sign of language death, when it's all-pervasive throughout the system, not just a one-off calque here or there where native idioms are kept and passed on (I also think it's a huge problem in other languages, even outside minority ones). \n\n> This is unavoidable and not a sign of language death.\n\nIn Irish's case it absolutely *is* avoidable. People need to understand you can't always translate idioms literally, and not everything has a direct one-to-one equivalent in Irish. They need to be exposed to more older Irish literature and need to be taught the way Irish expresses concepts, instead of just translating it directly from English. It's a huge issue, as even now the new 'authoritative' dictionary promotes these horrible calques. Granted, it also promotes non-native Irish in its corpus, which is another problem in and of itself, but it's 100% a sign of death the rate at which the natural Irish way of expressing concepts is dying out. \n\n\nTo give an example I remember hearing, normally in Irish you wouldn't 'win' (*buaigh/gn\u00f3thaigh*) an argument, but you'd 'settle' it (*r\u00e9itigh/socraigh*) with the other person. This could incline you to believe Irish speakers conceived of arguments differently than English speakers did. But, now with the fact that everything has to be one-to-one translatable with English, you start hearing *bhuaigh m\u00e9 an arg\u00f3int* (I won the argument), which is just importing English ways of conceptualising the world at the expense of the natural Gaelic ways. I would 100% argue this is language death when it happens *consistently* and across all domains of the language. Instead, what we're seeing is that minority language idioms and the semantic meanings of their words must line up to match perfectly with English.\n\nAnother recent example from Irish is the phrase *duine de dhath* for 'person of colour'. It literally makes no sense in traditional Irish, as *de* is used for what something is made out of. But people hated that the term for 'black person' was *daoine gorm* -- another thing that is being lost as people assume Irish colour terms must match one-to-one with those of English! -- and worked on finding a term for 'people of colour'. I'm perfectly fine with that, but they directly translated English, forcing an Irish preposition to work in a way it normally doesn't. This is linguistic colonialism, through and through. And, in the case of minority languages, fully represents language death in my experience (and I don't think it's a good thing in other major languages either, as we lose a lot of richness in how people can conceptualise the world as these terms are all taken from English).", "created_utc": "1660567718.0", "edited": "1660646240.0", "id": "ikdk703", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_wnnzz7", "parent_id": "t1_ikdh3pv", "score": "3", "subreddit": "linguistics", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhos"}, {"author": "galaxyrocker", "body": "> Using English expressions in Welsh is unavoidable, normal and nothing to be afraid of. This happens in most languages (including English, look at all the French vocabulary).\n\nThere's more than that going on.\n\nThere's also a difference between loan words, and straight up calques of cognitive metaphors. If Lakoff and Johnson are to be believed, cognitive metaphors are what shape how we think -- if one group (learners) doesn't learn them in another language and they outnumber the speakers who do use them, they'll eventually stopped getting passed on.\n\nInstead, what we'll see is an increasing amount of *English* cognitive metaphors expressed with Welsh words, as is happening with Irish. Directly thinking that idiomatic expressions must be directly translatable. Or, see this quote from *Endangered Metaphors* ([imgur link](https://imgur.com/a/X7KU3gf)). It's a major issue that often doesn't get talked about in minority language learning, and has various effects in talks of identity and colonialism (in fact, I'd say that replacing the native idioms/metaphors of a language with ones from the dominant language is one of the ultimate forms of colonialism).\n\n> Changing grammar structures and phonology (!!) is much worse.\n\nAbsolutely, and from what I've read this is also creeping into Welsh, albeit at a much slower rate.\n\n> The Irish language is in an awful shape.\n\nTo be quite honest, it's fucked. The government is more worried about tokenism, and the biggest \"promoter\", Conradh na Gaeilge has never cared about the Gaeltacht; they've always catered towards the middle-class urbanites.
