In case of messaging would it even be possible to use a decentralized system without P2P(as seen below it is)? Especially for a mainstream app P2P is not very secure for messaging anyone other than close friends and family. \n\nWould the next answer be a distributed system? Or possibly a P2P distributed network which is what Ring (ring.cx) have I believe, which I do not fully understand as they claim P2P Distributed with an intermediate server for undelivered messages, which essentially gives your ip to the person you are messaging and ring network, which doesn\u2019t sound very anonymous and secure. It also stores user data on the device itself which is acceptable as there is an option to permanently delete them.\n\nRiot/Matrix is also very interesting and which I been only been reading up on for the past day. Based on what I read on the matrix website (matrix.org), it seems like they are using blockchain in a form of instant messaging just like adamant.im. Information is send to their servers which is then stored in a blockchain, not running P2P and still decentralized, is this the answer? You mentioned that storing all this on a blockchain is insecure and not private as eventually they will all be decrypted due to them being available to anyone who wants them.\n\nAdamant.im claim that they do not \"disclosure or expose user IP-address\" (taken from their website), how is this possible? There has to be at least 1 point when you directly communicate with a server to store the information on blockchain, or is it that when communicating with blockchain it is completely anonymously and this is why they opted for such a method of storing data. Might it be the same system as picapica.im? I feel like they had the potential to make a great product but got lost on this whole blockchain and cryptocurrency integration into the messenger.
