I\u2019ve been writing for a long time in my short life, but I have a few tips/suggestions (things to do/things NOT to do). Sorry if some of these seem obvious. \n\nGeneral tips: \n\n- The best readers make the best writers. It doesn\u2019t even have to be fanfiction. Reading helps you pick up on formatting and improves your vocabulary/grammar. \n\n- Do NOT type in all lower case letters. Use proper punctuation. The amount of CM writers who do this is astounding. \n\n- Make sure you know how to format dialogue. \u201cBlah blah blah,\u201d she said. \n\n- Please spell check names (the amount of people who write JJ Jareau, Derrick, Reed, etc. ugh) \n\n- Break up your text. No one wants to read to a giant paragraph. Hit enter when new people are talking. \n\n- Try to use show, don\u2019t tell occasionally. It spices things up. \n\nFanfic tips: \n\n- Best domains: I recommend AO3 or fanfic.net, wattpad is not the greatest. It works but doesn\u2019t have the best rep, in my opinion. \n\n- Summaries are important. It gives a snapshot of your writing, just like with a book. \n\n- If you do character x reader, do NOT use \u201cI,\u201d use \u201cyou\u201d when referencing reader. \n\n- When writing dialogue, you need to think about the character. Write Garcia like Garcia, don\u2019t have Reid saying \u201cbro.\u201d You get the idea. \n\n- My favorite fan fictions have been the realistic ones: the ones where characters act like their character. \n\n- Read some other fanfics to get an idea of what sounds good. It\u2019ll be pretty obvious. \n\nI can get into specifics of writing for the fandom, but this is already long, so just message me or something if you want to talk about writing!!", "created_utc": "1623379132.0", "edited": "1623379498.0", "id": "h1cwls1", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_nx2v04", "parent_id": "t3_nx2v04", "score": "11", "subreddit": "criminalminds", "subreddit_id": "t5_2sv0q"}, {"author": "Alpha0963", "body": "Hehe I\u2019ve kissed more girls than you", "created_utc": "1623191484.0", "edited": "False", "id": "h131ejc", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_nvagc8", "parent_id": "t3_nvagc8", "score": "1", "subreddit": "teenagers", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjli"}, {"author": "Alpha0963", "body": "I tried my best to fill it out, but I still don\u2019t know my identity so it was a bit hard \n\nBest of luck!", "created_utc": "1623099393.0", "edited": "False", "id": "h0ydj9a", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_nuj9qg", "parent_id": "t3_nuj9qg", "score": "5", "subreddit": "LGBTeens", "subreddit_id": "t5_2t8gr"}, {"author": "Alpha0963", "body": "I broke my leg when I was 2 years and 8 months old.
