From here on out I'm not going to be improving as fast because I hit a realization of how Japanese is kinda useless, especially to me since I don't really want to make Japanese friends or move to Japan. However I'm not quitting because at the end of the day I also realized that I like improving and I really enjoy the content I spend time in, like light novels and YouTube and whatnot. So?
