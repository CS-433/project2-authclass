When the market goes down, you own the same number of shares. When the market goes up, you still own the same number of shares.\n\nYou\u2019re not losing anything. The market value is just what a share is worth if you sell it today. If you\u2019re not selling then that price doesn\u2019t matter.\n\nPeople think investing is this arcane activity, like it\u2019s just gambling and not based on anything real, but it\u2019s really not that different than buying a house. House prices go up and down - sometimes it\u2019s a seller\u2019s market, sometimes it\u2019s a buyer\u2019s market. It\u2019s best not to sell when the value is low unless you have no other choice. But as long as the house is still standing, is still a habitable house, it\u2019s going to be worth more than $0. And as long as a house is kept in good repair, historically those houses have, on average, gone up in value over extended periods of time.\n\nNow, there are risks when you only own one house. Something could happen to it. Owning single stocks is like that. You\u2019re buying a small percentage of ownership of that company, which is valuable as long as it keeps making a profit, which you get a share of. Its value can go down if it\u2019s having a bad year, bad management, not making a profit, but its value only goes to zero if it goes out of business entirely.\n\nOwning an index fund is owning pieces of a whole bunch of different companies. Total market index funds are made up of thousands of companies, and weighted toward those that are the *most* powerful, profitable, successful, etc. Instead of owning one house, you own thousands of houses all over the country/world, and most of your investment is in the nicest and most well-maintained homes on the planet. Now, sometimes homes are destroyed, but new ones are also built, and on average the overall value of your total investment goes up over time. But the impact of a single failure, or even several failures, has a much smaller impact on you because you\u2019re diversified into different communities, markets, etc.\n\nNow, can your investment go to zero? Sure. If every single one of those houses/companies were destroyed, all at one time, then your investment would no longer have any value.

Property value has increased on average 5% a year. My mortgage, taxes, utilities, and maintenance costs average $2500 a month - $500 of that is going toward mortgage principle so I would consider that money saved/invested and not spent. My previous housing was renting a studio apartment (no yard, etc.) for $1500 including utilities.

I've never seen anyone pass out. I have seen some people tear up, but not sobbing or screaming or anything super dramatic. We do make an effort not to use a tenaculum for placement unless absolutely necessary, which tends to make the procedure faster and definitely reduces pain. We also let patients know that it's typically less painful to place if they're on their period so if they're able to schedule during that time it's ideal. I've also had two IUDs myself - one was painful, one was only very mildly uncomfortable, so this is not a consistent experience even for the same patient. Ironically, the one that I was medicated for was much more painful. I do think some of the difference is provider dependent - in a lot of the US IUDs are not that common so providers may not have much practice placing them. By contrast, in our patient population it's the most popular form of birth control for adult women (nexplanon more common for teens), so our providers are very good at them.\n\nI honestly feel that the biggest issue is that there's so much rumor and horror stories about IUD placement. We have patients come in all the time who are incredibly tense and nervous about having one put in, which pre-disposes people to have a very negative experience.\n\nThat said, while we don't do pain control in our office, there's an increasing push for using something like topical lidocaine or nitrous (like dentists use) if patient requests it. These are pretty easy and inexpensive to implement in an outpatient setting. IM lidocaine for a cervical block is really more trouble than it's worth, since admin of IM lidocaine is in itself painful and it would make the procedure take 3x longer. OTC meds like ibuprofen are often given already, but I'm not sure that they're actually effective (maybe afterward to alleviate any lingering cramping, but not during).

I \\*usually\\* have several hours a day I can fit languages into, but if I'm short on time on some days then I'll default to my highest priority language(s) and fit them into whatever time I do have.\n\nTwo is pretty much the maximum number I can consistently put up with at the beginner level, because for the most part beginner resources are not terribly interesting. Once I'm intermediate things change because I find \"studying\" at that point is mostly just fun and doesn't feel like work. (As a side note: for me, maintaining multiple languages at A2 would be pretty much impossible. I want to learn lots of languages, but my goal is to hit at least B1 or B2 before moving on to the next, because I need to be able to engage with native speakers and native materials without too much difficulty in order to maintain my interest over the long term.)\n\nSo, for intermediate I have two - Spanish and Esperanto. I prioritize Spanish more than Esperanto, so preferentially spend more time on it. I don't keep track, but for Spanish it's definitely at least two hours a day. Esperanto is mostly just on the weekends.\n\nFor beginner, I have Yup'ik and French. In \\*theory\\*, Yup'ik is higher priority. In practice, French hurts my brain less and is easier to fit into my day. My goal is 1 hour a day for both, though if I'm in the mood and have the time I can do a lot more. For French, right now that's typically a Pimsleur lesson in the morning while I'm getting ready for work, and Assimil and Duolingo when I feel like it throughout the day for a few minutes at a time.

I refuse). I have \u201cunlimited\u201d data on my phone, but they throttle it to 256kb/sec if I use more that 12gb. So I mostly download stuff using the wifi at work, and then limit myself to internet activity that isn\u2019t data heavy (no YouTube \ud83e\udd7a).\n\nLet\u2019s see, regular language learning apps. Memrise, Duolingo, Beelinguapp, Clozemaster. Of these, I\u2019d say I use Clozemaster the most. I\u2019m new to Beelinguapp, not sure if I like it enough to keep it around (I like the concept, but I tend to do longer L-R using novels already). Memrise I\u2019m using specifically for Yup\u2019ik. I\u2019m using Duo for French for now, but that\u2019s probably not going to last long because it\u2019s really not my favorite thing.\n\nOld school language courses that happen to be apps now: Pimsleur, Assimil, and Teach Yourself.

And Spanish represents more than 50% of second language studies in the US, so the market is even more saturated when you add in non-native speakers.\n\nAn example of what I mean by market saturation. I work in healthcare and at least two of our local area hospitals do not employ dedicated Spanish interpreters at all, because they have enough other staff that are dual qualified that they don\u2019t need to. If there\u2019s a patient who needs a Spanish interpreter, then we have a nurse, doc, security person, tech, etc. available who is certified. Having Spanish is definitely an asset for these people and they get paid extra if they\u2019re certified, but they\u2019re not earning their living *just* speaking Spanish. We do *not* have a similar market saturation for most other languages, so we have to use a service that provides interpreters. Those interpreters earn a full time living *just* as interpreters. Fewer opportunities, granted, but the ones that exist are *on average* more lucrative (our Spanish cert. folks might be earning a couple thousand dollars a year more than if they didn\u2019t speak Spanish, versus a full time interpreter\u2019s whole annual salary). And while full time Spanish language gigs definitely exist, market saturation means that the competition for those roles is more fierce because there are proportionally fewer highly compensated roles available.\n\nAll that said, there\u2019s a market for almost any language, really. A good friend of mine makes 6 figures as a research linguist for the state government, researching and developing programs to preserve local indigenous languages that all have numbers of speakers in the thousands, or even less. Not millions, not even hundreds of thousands, not tens of thousands. He makes a good living because he took the time out of his life to learn multiple languages that have 10k or fewer speakers. Market saturation wise there are probably fewer than 10 other people on the *planet* who have his combination of skill sets and qualifications.\n\nSo I stand by what I said.

In practice, double bookings are a thing, patients show up when they show up (and we see them as soon as we can fit them, not necessarily at time), and scheduled appointments are frequently replaced with same day add-ons. We\u2019re assigned three rooms, and I think the most patients I\u2019ve had at once was six (that\u2019s really unusual, thankfully. Usually if I have more than three checked in the others stay in the waiting room until I have space).\n\nThe area I\u2019m in is very rural, and very poor, and the hospital has often paid the travel expenses for patients coming in from out of town (our hospital is the regional hub for a geographic area approx the size of Oregon, and none of the dozens of communities we serve are connected to us by road). What that means in practice is that if the patient is in clinic, you treat them for what they need and not necessarily what they\u2019re scheduled for, because you have no idea when they\u2019ll be able to make it back to the doctor in the future. So sometimes a \u201cwell woman exam,\u201d turns into a workup for three different things, incl. an ultrasound, CT, biopsy, referral/consult with psych or PT or MAT, etc. - we go until we\u2019re done, regardless of when the \u201cappointment time\u201d is theoretically over. \n\nI\u2019ve floated to the ED here a handful of times, and honestly for the lower acuity patients it didn\u2019t feel that different. For higher acuity stuff, I\u2019m doing more triage than anything - we\u2019re doing the initial workup, getting IV access and labs, activating resources, and transferring the patient to the appropriate department (for me that\u2019s most often OB, occasionally ED, rarely medsurg, and very, very rarely direct medevac). It does get a little jarring though, when I get back from rush admitting a patient with severe pre-eclampsia to find my next scheduled patient disgruntled because their  appointment for a new birth control prescription was supposed to start ten minutes ago and I\u2019m late.\n\nThere are actually days where I do nothing but routine care - normal prenatal exams, well-woman, birth control, some STI screening. That\u2019s a weird day though, and after more than a couple patients in a row are totally healthy it makes me nervous and I start to side-eye people when they tell me they\u2019re fine. That\u2019s usually when a patient will pop a BP of 200/120 or someone who has been having \u201coccasional cramping\u201d will turn out to be 8cm dilated and things will go back to normal again, lol.", "created_utc": "1656911064.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ies8k3n", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_vpsncs", "parent_id": "t1_ier6iiq", "score": "1", "subreddit": "nursing", "subreddit_id": "t5_2ra72"}, {"author": "LiathGray", "body": "Outpatient attached to a rural hospital - Primary & Urgent care.

It\u2019s more money than my parents ever made in their lives. Now, granted, it\u2019s a high cost of living area so that number is a bit of an outlier, but the point still stands - it\u2019s a lot more than $15. After bonuses and overtime I\u2019m looking at making in excess of $120k in my first year as an RN. That\u2019s a *lot* of money in my books.\n\nThere are literally millions of nurses in the U.S. (and they\u2019re pretty common in other countries too). At any given time (even pre-pandemic) there are tens of thousands of job openings all over the country, if not more.\n\nNow, some nursing jobs pay better than others, but even at the low end nurses make a living wage, and at the higher end a lot of nurses do *very* well for themselves. \n\nThere\u2019s no guarantee that you\u2019ll get a dream job with a dream wage anywhere you go, but as long as you have a nursing license in good standing you should be able to get *a* job that pays enough to live on *somewhere.*\n\nAs someone who had experienced extended unemployment before, and who has had to decide \u201cwhich bill will I not pay this month so I can buy food?\u201d\u2026 The job security, flexibility, pay, etc. available to nurses after only getting an Associates degree is amazing to me.\n\nIt\u2019s a career, not a magic get rich quick ticket.

There are resources, but they\u2019re often not easy to access (and there\u2019s generally no effort to educate service members on how to do so, or even what those resources are). Even if you do ask for help with a bad situation, bureaucracy is a slow moving machine and it often doesn\u2019t move fast enough, if at all.\n\nThe military can be a good career. *If* you\u2019re young, healthy, already physically fit enough to meet standards, and you\u2019re assertive and not afraid to advocate for yourself and others. I don\u2019t regret serving. I got nearly 100k worth of education out of the deal, and I have healthcare for the rest of my life. With the options I had and the situation I was in at 18, I would still make the same choice.\n\nAs an RN, who can get a job anywhere? I wouldn\u2019t do it now. If I was still young and fit, I might do it for a flight nurse contract.\n\nIf you\u2019re genuinely interested in the military for its own sake, I wouldn\u2019t naysay it. But don\u2019t settle - get everything in writing. And do your research first.\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in the *benefits* of military service, but not necessarily the military itself so much, you might consider the Public Health Service Commissioned Corps.\n\nIf you don\u2019t want to be told where to live and who to work with for the next 4-6 years, don\u2019t do it.", "created_utc": "1631086132.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hc17sj9", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_pk1xqw", "parent_id": "t3_pk1xqw", "score": "5", "subreddit": "nursing", "subreddit_id": "t5_2ra72"}, {"author": "LiathGray", "body": "God, I hate allergy lists.

There\u2019s a reason so many of my classmates were career changing - CNAs, LPNs, Paramedics, Surg Techs, MAs, etc. If it was just about a \u201ccalling\u201d to help people, why would any of them have bothered to come back to school? LPNs, Paramedics? They\u2019re already in careers that help people. It\u2019s absolutely about having more opportunities and a higher paycheck for most of them. It\u2019s definitely *not* about attaining some sort of \u201clady with the lamp\u201d level sainthood. \n\nNot all of us are in it to be the next Mother Teresa.

Based on the data and research that has been done, the answer to the \u201cshould I get vaccinated\u201d question are so overwhelmingly on the side of vaccination that there\u2019s really no excuse to not do it. *Millions* of people have died from Covid globally.\n\nThe best data we have in the U.S. about deaths related to Covid vaccination, on the other hand, is VAERS (the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System). The problem with VAERS is that *anyone* can submit a report, and there\u2019s no requirement for reports to be verified in any way. There\u2019s no way to determine if a report is even real, much less whether it represents a causal or coincidental event that occurred after a vaccination. The absolute worst case apocalyptic scenario, assuming that *every* report is accurate, and *every* adverse event was actually *caused* by the vaccine (a scenario that is about as likely as fairies stealing your socks) there have only been a few thousand deaths reported as having occurred within *50 days* of receiving the vaccination, and that\u2019s after more than 380 million doses have been administered. A substantial percentage of those deaths occurred in people age 80 and above with underlying medical conditions, who could have died from literally anything. There is no actual evidence that any of those deaths were directly caused by the vaccine. As far as I\u2019m aware, the only vaccine that has been confirmed to be causal of a significant number of serious adverse reactions (vaccine-induced thrombosis and thrombocytopenia is a *very rare* but confirmed complication) has been the AstraZeneca vaccine, which isn\u2019t even available in the U.S., and even that vaccine is still substantially safer than staying unvaccinated.\n\nLet me break that down more simply.\n\nGlobally, we have high quality data that tells us that approximately 215 million confirmed cases of Covid have resulted in nearly 4.5 million deaths.\n\nWithin the U.S. more than 380 million doses of Covid vaccine have been administered, with no confirmed deaths.\n\nIn short, get vaccinated.

They end up in med school because they did well in a good high school, which allowed them to get into and do well in a good undergrad. They were typically able to participate in things like extracurricular activities and volunteering, which require things like leisure time and often also money to accomplish. These things are \\*heavily\\* correlated with coming from a stable and comfortable background. More than 50% of U.S. medical students come from families in the top 5% of U.S. household income.

Instead of a direct line high school -> college -> med school path, a nurse practitioner is often someone who started entry level as an RN, LPN, or even a CNA, and pursued continuing education as they worked in the field to support themselves (and also often their families). This allows for a more democratic cross-section of people to become qualified to practice as mid-level providers (and, not incidentally, increase their income earning potential and potentially move them up the socio-economic ladder as well as the medical one).\n\nRich privileged people don't like to be told that their success has anything to do with their privilege though. Implying that someone who \"couldn't get into med school\" might still be a good clinician hits them right in their superiority complex.\n\nI am \\*not\\* arguing that mid-levels are equivalent to physicians, here. There are legitimate and meaningful differences in the training and backgrounds of physicians vs. midlevel providers. However, I \\*am\\* saying that people who become physicians are \\*not innately superior\\* to people who go into other healthcare careers.\n\nImplying that mid-levels are uppity people who are abandoning their true capabilities as RNs, and thus clearing the field for even more uppity people who \"would have been suited\" to be CNAs to become nurses?

It sounds like he\u2019s quoting some things out of context while other things are completely made up.\n\nEdited to add more detailed rebuttal to some of his points:\n\n- A virus having a non-human reservoir doesn't make it inherently uncontrollable or impossible to vaccinate against.\n\n- Vaccines *don't* necessarily prevent you from getting infection, per se. Often, they make it so your immune system fights it off quickly enough that you never become symptomatic. Statistically, people who still become ill with, say, the flu or Covid-19 after being vaccinated tend to have much less severe illness and recover faster (some of this is related to viral load. Google it if you want more info). Even vaccines that are not 100% effective at preventing infection still decrease overall rate of transmission because decreasing the duration and severity of infection also decreases the amount of time that someone is contagious. The less time someone is contagious, the less time they have to spread an illness to other people.\n\n- Vitamin D and Zinc are irrelevant. Granted, it's better if people aren't vitamin and mineral deficient in general, but Vitamin D has been postulated as a sort of alternative medicine cure-all for a few years now and it's just not supported by actual evidence.\n\n- Covid-19 hasn't been around long enough for it to be considered seasonal. People actually do get the flu and colds year-round. Transmission is higher in winter because of a combination of behavioral and environmental factors, but the illnesses don't actually disappear in summer.\n\n- The current outbreak of the delta variant has nothing to do with vaccines. Viruses mutate rapidly, and mutations that make a virus more contagious are not unusual. More contagious makes the virus more successful - this is natural selection 101. The delta variant seems to have a much higher viral load than last year's original outbreak - higher viral load means that patient's are more contagious (more virus in their system that gets spread around to other people) and more sick (more virus inside their bodies to mess them up).\n\n- He says he's treated \"over 15 Covid-19 patients.\" That's not a statistically significant number. That number of people could have got Covid, then stood on their heads for 30 seconds every morning, got better on their own, and this guy would be telling us that headstands cure Covid-19.\n\n- Ivermectin is a deworming medication. There were some early in vitro studies that showed it *might* have an impact on Covid-19. Lots of stuff that works in vitro doesn't work in real life, because our bodies are a little more complicated than your average glass vial or petri dish. Clinical trials on actual humans have not shown benefit from using ivermectin.\n\nThere's probably more, but I'm tired.

It\u2019s about three bookcases and a large dresser full right now. Why? For me, it\u2019s a combination of process and budget. \n\nFirst off, my process for making stuff is pretty spontaneous. I\u2019m not big on planning, and I like to make up my own designs so I typically shop for stash rather than for specific projects. Even when I use a pattern, I\u2019ll pick yarn from what I already have instead of buying what the pattern maker recommends. I do multiple fiber crafts, so I have different stashes for different things (weaving yarn, knitting yarn, and crochet thread and yarn, sewing supplies, embroidery materials, etc. I use different fibers for different kinds of projects - I have cotton for home goods and amigurumi, and wool and other fibers for clothes and blankets, for example). I have a pretty good sized room for my office and crafting space, and my stash is still smaller than my available storage area, so I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a problem.\n\nPrice wise, stocking up often saves money in the long run, as long as you actually use your materials and aren\u2019t just aimlessly collecting. I just bought a little more of my favorite wool yarn in a few different colors, for example, because it was on sale for $6 a skein when it\u2019s usually $15-16 a skein. The vast majority of my stash is stuff that I bought on clearance or heavily discounted. I typically aim for at least 50% off full price. I usually buy multiples, though I\u2019ve found that even single skeins can be readily incorporated into larger projects as an accent color or trim. I don\u2019t shop for yarn constantly - I keep an eye out for big sales and pick things up a couple times a year as needed. I do a lot of crafting - I am typically working on *something* every day - so I do use up my stash at a reasonable rate.\n\nAs far as materialism, more being better, etc. I guess it can be? Crafting is an inherently materialistic hobby, since you need stuff in order to be able to do it, but how much people want to have is going to depend on the person. I think social media can make it seem like super large stashes are normal because a significant number of people posting actually earn an income from their crafting. There\u2019s nothing wrong with having a small stash or a large stash, imo, as long as it makes you happy, it serves a purpose for you, and it\u2019s in your budget.\n\nDifferent people are going to be happy with different amounts of stuff. I think it\u2019s like any other hobby, really. I also do some photography, but I\u2019m not serious about it and most of what I use is my phone and some apps on said phone. My best friend, otoh, has thousands of dollars invested in cameras, lights, lenses, hard drives, editing software, etc. He\u2019s good enough at photography that he even made an income from it for a while before he decided that he has more fun when he doesn\u2019t have to deal with customers. It would be ridiculous for me to buy that much stuff - I\u2019d never use it, and I can\u2019t afford $$$$$ in camera gear.

If you want to live in a home on wheels and travel, an RV makes more sense since they\u2019re actually designed to be somewhat aerodynamic and easy to move, and if you want to live a more stationary life then a small house in a rural or suburban area, or small urban apartment/condo makes more sense to me.\n\nTiny houses are cute, but overall I think they\u2019re the least sensible of all available options, unless you plan to live in a designated tiny house community (there aren\u2019t many) or have the ability to plant your tiny house on someone else\u2019s property for free or very cheap.", "created_utc": "1611453402.0", "edited": "False", "id": "gkhb7v9", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_l3o9vj", "parent_id": "t3_l3o9vj", "score": "118", "subreddit": "simpleliving", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r0za"}, {"author": "LiathGray", "body": "Yup.

Cyclothymia is, basically, a milder form of mood cycling than bipolar.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t know, statistically, what the odds are of moving from one diagnostic category to another are, but all illnesses can get better, stay the same, or get worse.\n\nThere seems to be some scientific evidence that severe mood episodes actually damage the brain over time, which means that for some bipolar patients the condition is degenerative - it gets worse, and it also gradually impairs cognitive function much in the way that dementia does. Otoh, I have also read that some people experience significantly fewer symptoms after a certain age, or even go completely into remission as they reach late middle age or their elder years. There seems to be significant variance in the lifetime progression of bipolar type mood disorders.\n\nHonestly, I think your best source of information is your own history. Have you always experienced the kinds of symptoms you have now? Have you seen significant progression in the severity of your symptoms, or have they been relatively consistent over time? Even if your symptoms have been progressively worsening, though, treatment *is* effective for a lot of people and there\u2019s good evidence that treatment can slow or stop the progressive/degenerative effects of bipolar disorder. One thing that does appear to be true though is that if you haven\u2019t developed Bipolar I (full manic episodes) by your thirties, it probably won\u2019t ever happen (people who have psychotic episodes for the first time at later ages generally have a different cause).\n\nMy personal advice? Take the best possible care of yourself that you can.

Then, for the sake of my nose, I threw it back in the wash on hot with some mild detergent. \n\nAfter second wash, it\u2019s taking a tumble in the dryer, which is where I think I\u2019m going to see some actual shrinkage (all part of the plan). It\u2019s coming along well so far.\n\nWashing had also had the benefit of making the wool feel softer, too. There\u2019s no magic that\u2019s going to make it feel like fine merino wool, but it\u2019s definitely more cushiony and less scratchy than it was.\n\nOverall, I prefer having a blanket that I\u2019m not going to be afraid to throw in the wash, also.

I did this myself - turns out my glass of milk was actually 2.5-3 cups - with whole milk, that meant I was routinely underestimating by more than 200 calories. My glass of milk had as many calories as my whole meal should have.\n\nA lot of people also equate \u201chealthy\u201d with low calorie. Yes, avocados, nuts, bananas, olive oil, salmon, etc. are all healthy. They also all have calories. Heck, there are people who \u201cstart eating healthy\u201d who actually gain weight, because start eating nuts the way they used to eat potato chips, and they put guacamole and olive oil on everything, and they don\u2019t realize that they\u2019re eating 600 calories in just salad dressing every day.\n\nEating low calorie dense foods is important for satiety, but they\u2019re also easier to track and it\u2019s less of an issue if you don\u2019t track them accurately. You underestimated your morning serving of strawberries by a whole cup? 50 calories. You underestimated your salad dressing by 1 or 2 tablespoons? 100-250 calories. You put peanut butter on your fruit, but just eyeballed it? Easily could have added 300+ calories more than you thought you did without even noticing. If your calorie budget is 1800, 300 calories is a lot!\n\nIt sucks because people will completely overhaul their eating, get rid of all the \u201cunhealthy\u201d foods and replace them with \u201chealthy\u201d foods, and they\u2019re feeling like they\u2019re doing the most and working so hard... and nothing will happen. Fact is, they\u2019d have been better off with a much simpler strategy - keep eating whatever you already eat, but halve the portions and make half your plate raw or steamed veggies instead. Boom, instantly eating fewer calories.\n\nPeople really should start with carefully tracking whatever they already eat, and identify where they can make the most meaningful changes. Switching from white bread to wheat bread or from butter to olive oil? Won\u2019t make a difference - might even backfire if you eat more because you think it\u2019s healthier. Changing from the 2000 calorie fast food combo meal to a home-prepped sandwich and some fruit for 500 calories? Huge impact. If you\u2019re eating a 600 calorie meal that you really, really love - swapping it out for a \u201chealthy\u201d alternative for the same amount of calories may feel like deprivation without actually making any difference in your results - maybe you could just add some veggies, then stop worrying about it.

It\u2019s a bit of a slog, and it\u2019s not a weight loss book, but he goes into a lot of how habits influence unconscious behavior and not just how that applies to individuals, but how it can be used by corporations, and how it\u2019s used in marketing.\n\nI also recently picked up Healthy as F*ck, by Oonagh Duncan (and yes, there\u2019s an asterisk in the title, I didn\u2019t just decide to put it there), which is a health/fitness/diet book primarily targeted at women, but the whole system she recommends is based on habit change as well (personally, since this is already the strategy I have adopted, she\u2019s not really telling me anything new. But it\u2019s a short book, and I\u2019m reading it to see if it\u2019s something I think my mom will find useful).\n\nI\u2019ve read some actual scientific research papers, but none I could recommend off the top of my head, I\u2019m afraid.\n\nDuhigg talks much more about the science (he\u2019s a journalist, not a scientist, but he interviewed scientists while writing the book, in addition to doing his own research) while Duncan\u2019s book is more of a practical how-to.\n\nIn my recent re-reading of The Power of Habit, one of my take-aways was that neuroscience appears to indicate that habits are patterns in the brain that actually never go away - if you have a strong habit, and over-write it, the neurological effects of both are still there even years later (think about how easy it would be to drive to an old job or an old home where you lived for years - wouldn\u2019t even have to think about it, right). This explains why it\u2019s easy to return to bad habits, even after years, because you never really lose them, but also why people with *good* habits can also easily return to those behaviors once they\u2019re well-established. But it emphasized to me that in order to really change my life for the rest of my life, I have to create behaviors for myself that I genuinely prefer to the old behaviors, even *stronger* habits, or it won\u2019t work. My new habits have to be powerful and rewarding, because heaven knows I ain\u2019t gettin any of this done by willpower alone!\n\nI find that understanding that a lot of behaviors are about unconscious habits, and not any kind of guilt on my part (this is how *all* brains work, I\u2019m not worse than other people, I just don\u2019t have all the right habits yet), really helps me, too. It explains a lot about why people struggle to change, and why some people succeed, and it gives me actionable steps to get into that second group that aren\u2019t just things like discipline and willpower (hahahahahahahahaha, yeah, I suck at that stuff, lol).\n\nAnother book I like that I think talks a bit about how to make exercise, specifically, a habit is The Spark, by John Ratey, which is about how exercise affects the brain, but not about habit formation in general.", "created_utc": "1599068810.0", "edited": "False", "id": "g3qudqa", "is_submitter": "True", "link_id": "t3_ikgqng", "parent_id": "t1_g3pv6e2", "score": "2", "subreddit": "CICO", "subreddit_id": "t5_3c3pm"}, {"author": "LiathGray", "body": "As a shorter comment - running can be rewarding, eventually, but usually if you\u2019re looking for sugar you\u2019re looking for a quick fix, right?\n\nIs there anything that you can think of that you really love to do or that is really fun that you can do in just a couple minutes?

I lost about 50 lbs  mostly through exercise and as a result of treating my bipolar disorder (meds made me lose my appetite).

I was tired of my knees hurting. I was tired of believing that deliberate weight loss was too difficult or beyond my capabilities, and figured out that it\u2019s not actually any more difficult than any other type of behavior change - that is to say, it\u2019s difficult, but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s impossible, and the results are worth it. \n\nI also pretty much reached the limits of how much my life could improve with medication and therapy alone, and knew that if I wanted to continue to improve my quality of life and the effectiveness of my treatment then I\u2019d need to consciously address my eating and exercise behaviors. As part of my treatment I have already had to make substantial changes to my behavior (learning to do things like sleep on a schedule, for example).\n\nI\u2019ve lost weight primarily through diet this time around (and exercise, but I\u2019ve always exercised) - mostly common sense changes.

I just don\u2019t understand how it became the standard for the entire health/fitness/dietetics/etc. industry.\n\nED treatment is critical for the people who experience those conditions, I would never argue that. The general health and fitness population though is a completely different setting - about 1-5% of the population will experience an eating disorder in their lifetimes (depending on how broadly you define the term eating disorder), while 70% of the U.S. population is *currently* overweight or obese. About 40% of the U.S. population is obese, and the prevalence of severe obesity has nearly doubled in less than 20 years (consulted CDC on that).\n\nIt genuinely does not make any sense to apply strategies that are used to treat restrictive eating disorders to the general population when the vast majority of people in that population are struggling with an entirely different set of problems.\n\nI personally think that the emotional weight of framing food as a relationship is problematic for people who may already associate food with human connection, which is fairly common in obesity, which is often seen to run in families because of shared behaviors and a shared food culture.\n\nThe health and fitness industry on the whole is completely failing to make any statistical impact on health or fitness in the U.S. I feel like there\u2019s lots of room for criticism because of that alone.

They're not profoundly presenting anything that hasn't been done before or isn't available elsewhere.\n\nThe coaching is overhyped. Arguably, calling it coaching at all is treading pretty close to false advertising. The coaches are not really available for truly customized advice - they're not therapists, trainers, or new friends. They're supposed to help you set a goal each week, and theoretically reach out to you if you stop using the app. That's it.\n\nThe group coaching/chat can be kind of nice, but there isn't anything there that you couldn't find here on Reddit.\n\nI personally like the food tracking - I actually like that it provides very little information. It's just calories and caloric density via the color code system, which are the two most important categories of information you need for successful weight loss according to science. I don't need or want to know on a daily basis what my macros are or whether I've hit the right numbers on every single micronutrient. Scientifically, there's no evidence that macros have a significant impact on weight loss success long term - just eat some protein and fiber with each meal for satiety and forget about the other bs. Focus on the basics, don't try to make things more complicated than they need to be.\n\nThe app encourages physical activity for me, since my calorie allowance gets much more realistic once I've logged my exercise for the day. I also have my weight loss set on the slower end, because I'm not interested in attempting to eat a 1200 calorie diet even if it would make me lose weight faster.\n\nI really, really like the psychology aspect of it. I feel like this doesn't get talked about enough. Some of it seems hokey, I know, and sometimes it's like getting hit in the face with an obvious pie, but hear me out on this. I've been in therapy for \\*years\\*, and you'd be surprised how effective this kind of short, simple messaging can really be. Try to slow down and really consider the psych lessons, don't just skim them or page through because you think you already know it or you think it's obvious. I think that the design of the course - the way it limits the number of lessons you can do in a day, and you're supposed to do a little bit every day - is potentially a very effective way to get people to do the program consistently. I know that I've been helped by the lessons, and I've also stuck with this program longer than any other I've ever tried. The course is set up with \\*months\\* of material, and that's pretty great.\n\nOverall, I think it's a good app. The method is scientifically sound, both behaviorally and nutritionally. It's not really set up to accommodate anyone who wants to do a drastic diet (keto, for example), but it is designed to encourage people to adopt small changes, using methods that have been studied and shown to be effective for people who have lost significant weight and kept it off a long time. The recommendations fall very much in line with techniques that have been identified by scientists studying successful weight losers and maintainers.\n\nI feel like Noom's advertising is its own worst enemy, in a way. Noom has a sort of split personality. On the one hand, you have a program that has been developed with some of the best current nutritional and behavioral science in mind. On the other hand, you have a marketing department that is emphasizing how it can help you with quick weight loss, and the app automatically sets everyone's weight loss speed to the fastest setting (greatest caloric deficit), because that's what sells, even if it's not what leads to the most successful outcomes. Then people try it for two weeks, it just looks like any other quick-fix diet plan, and they stop using it. Weight loss is a long game - long as in years, as in the rest of your life. Noom's \\*programming\\* is here for that long game, their marketing is just trying to sell you shit.\n\nAll of that said... it's overpriced. It's overpriced, and it's not \\*really\\* delivering anything you couldn't get elsewhere. They get away with charging more than they otherwise could, because of the live coach aspect, but the live coaching is not worth what they charge for it.

But it\u2019s not a magic money machine by any stretch, and there are downsides to having to constantly have your public face on in your own home. I mostly manage alright because I have a sort of pseudo-duplex. I live in my downstairs where I have my own space and a kitchenette and a \u201cPrivate: Do Not Enter\u201d sign on the door. The upstairs has the main kitchen, living room, and guest bedrooms.

Last year we grossed just under $10k, though to be fair that doesn\u2019t include the rental income from the room I rent out to my roommate, which is no longer listed on Airbnb, but if you extrapolate from my other listings we would probably have grossed around $15k last year if all three were still up.\n\nPart of the drop in income is competition driving prices down. Another part of it is that when Airbnb started collecting room tax, customers aren\u2019t actually willing to pay 12% more, so we had to drop prices to compensate. We might get more winter business if I was willing to drop rates even more, but my ability to deal with strangers and their bs in my home rapidly diminishes below $40-50 a night. Ymmv.

May and September are a crapshoot, could go either way, usually around 40-50% occupancy, or less.\n\nAlso, the vast majority of flights arrive at Ted Stevens late at night. Are you comfortable having people check in between 10pm and 3am?   Most of my out of state guests do. I have self check-in procedures set up, but there are still guests that call us at 2am because they can\u2019t follow directions.\n\nHonestly, I make more money from the room I have rented out to a longterm roommate - by about double. She pays less per month than an airbnb guest would, but she\u2019s paying 12 months out of the year instead of 3, and I don\u2019t have to clean up after her. If I could find other long term roommates that we really got on with, I\u2019d quit airbnb for good.

Someone brought up the assumption that godparents are the same as guardians, but that\u2019s not actually an assumption anyone is making. It\u2019s in the text:\n\nPoA Ch. 20: \n\n\u201c*But I\u2019m also - I don\u2019t know if anyone ever told you - I\u2019m your godfather.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, I knew that,\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cWell... your parents appointed me your guardian,\u201d said Sirius stiffly. \u201cIf anything ever happened to them...\u201d*\n\n\nNow, Dumbledore\u2019s motivations are open for debate on the topic, obviously. We don\u2019t see inside his head. But it seems clear to me that he took action as a political leader of a faction that Harry\u2019s parents had been a part of in securing the surviving child with guardians of his choosing, without reference to whether he had the legal authority to do so.\n\nNow, sure, it\u2019s entirely possible that Harry would have ended up with his nearest relatives anyway, but that\u2019s not actually an inevitable placement for a child. Children may end up with a family friend, in a foster home, or with less closely related family members - and usually a legal placement involves at least some investigation into whether or not the family is somewhat suitable and also *willing* to take the children in. \n\nNow, this doesn\u2019t necessarily make him manipulative, but it does make Dumbledore *responsible.* However, the manipulative subtext *does* exist in the text. Dumbledore\u2019s own stated motivation for keeping Harry there is not for his safety, but for the psychological value of having Harry not grow up knowing he\u2019s famous.\n\nIn the first chapter of the first book, Dumbledore talks to McGonagall, who is only present at number 4 because Hagrid told her where Dumbledore was going to be (and Hagrid knowing Harry\u2019s location undermines any argument about Harry\u2019s placement being super secret, btw).\n\nDumbledore: \u201c*I\u2019ve come to bring Harry to his aunt and uncle. They\u2019re the only family he has left now.\u201d*\n\n[McGonagall objects, Dumbledore says it\u2019s the best place for him, McGonagall says Harry will be famous...]\n\n\u201c*Exactly,\u201d said Dumbledore [...]. \u201cIt would be enough to turn any boy\u2019s head. Famous before he can walk and talk! Famous for something he won\u2019t even remember! Can\u2019t you see how much better off he\u2019ll be, growing up away from all that until he\u2019s ready to take it?\u201d *\n\nThey then leave Harry on the doorstep, where he\u2019s woken up \u201c*in a few hours\u2019 time by Mrs. Dursley\u2019s scream as she opened the front door to put out the milk bottles.\u201d*\n\nThere is no good evidence in canon that his location growing up was super secure and secret - the opposite, in fact. People from the wizarding world appear to have encountered Harry almost routinely.\n\nPS, Ch. 2: *Yet sometimes he thought (or maybe hoped) that strangers on the street seemed to know him. Very strange strangers they were, too. A tiny man in a violet too hat [...] A wild-looking old woman dressed all in green [...] A bald man in a very long purple coat had actually shaken his hand in the street the other day and then walked away without a word.*\n\nBook 5, Ch. 37, Dumbledore emphasizes his concern for Harry\u2019s safety... but he\u2019s talking *to Harry*, he\u2019s had more than a decade to build up a justification for his actions, and even here he cannot help but to mention the psychological aspect of his decision.\n\n*\u201dFive years ago, then,\u201d continued Dumbledore, as though he had not paused in his story, \u201cyou arrived at Hogwarts, neither as happy nor as well nourished as I would have liked, perhaps, yet alive and healthy. You were not a pampered little prince, but as normal a boy as I could have hoped under the circumstances. Thus far, my plan was working well.\u201d\n\nDumbledore tells Harry first that he knew that he was \u201ccondemning [Harry] to ten dark and difficult years\u201d, but then that the flaw in his plans for Harry was that he cared *too much* for Harry\u2019s happiness. Honestly, re-reading that chapter just now makes me eyeroll so hard I almost hurt myself.\n\nTaking Dumbledore\u2019s actions at face value, crediting him with his own stated motivations, he is a character that acts according to his own counsel and without ever seeking the advice of people with different viewpoints who might disagree with him. Dumbledore thinks that what he is doing is right, and feels entirely justified when other people suffer while bearing the consequences of his choices.\n\nDumbledore has and exercises a lot of power in canon. Disclaiming his actions as inevitable, saying he didn\u2019t have any other choices, IMO does not jive with what the books actually say. That doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s an evil, manipulative, mastermind chessmaster, necessarily, but his actions aren\u2019t above reproach either.\n\nDumbledore is a complex character who had a great deal of agency in the text. Exploring his actions and motivations is interesting precisely because he has so much influence on the other characters and the overall story.", "created_utc": "1589409513.0", "edited": "False", "id": "fqjg8z5", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_gimadr", "parent_id": "t1_fqh4sfq", "score": "7", "subreddit": "HPfanfiction", "subreddit_id": "t5_2t100"}, {"author": "LiathGray", "body": "In the Hobbit, Gandalf is a wise figure who calls the protagonist into the adventure partly by being somewhat manipulative. He doesn\u2019t give anyone all of the available information and often acts according to his own motivations that the protagonist and the reader are not always aware of. However, both Bilbo and Frodo are adult characters that Gandalf is not responsible for in any meaningful way. Gandalf is wise and powerful, but the relationship between him and the other characters is on a much more equal footing - wise mentor and friend, *not* teacher or guardian.\n\nDumbledore is something else. He serves a similar purpose in the narrative to Gandalf, but it doesn\u2019t work out quite the same. Harry is a child who Dumbledore has very real power over, and how he uses that power is problematic.\n\nThe Potter fandom is an interesting place. Many fans (myself included) started reading the books as children, but are now of an age to have children ourselves, and our perspectives on the narrative have changed as we\u2019ve grown with the stories.\n\nDumbledore was responsible for Harry\u2019s placement with the Dursleys initially, as well as his return there during summers. The canon-level treatment of Harry is abusive and abuse has lifelong consequences. The idea of keeping a child safe, but unhappy, is untenable to me. Any reasonable person could come up with dozens of ways to make the situation more bearable - something as simple as regular welfare checks on the child could have made a real difference. Like, you know, not going ten years before noticing that the kid doesn\u2019t even get to sleep in a bedroom. There\u2019s a real cognitive dissonance created when you try to ascribe a character\u2019s motivations to love, but also show that he didn\u2019t check on a small child for ten years. It just doesn\u2019t wash. Dumbledore\u2019s relationship with Harry is more notional than actual for much of the story - he says that he cares but his actions tell a different story.\n\nDumbledore is not Harry\u2019s friend. He\u2019s Harry\u2019s school headmaster. He has a duty to care for the children in his school, and that duty should *not* include placing children in abusive homes, hiring irresponsible and/or abusive teachers, or exposing children to life-threatening situations.\n\nThe HP series uses a number of common children\u2019s fiction tropes - the abused orphan, the wise old mentor, etc. Part of the problem with Dumbledore though is that the style of his portrayal in the books changes. The books grow with the protagonist in maturity - characters that are somewhat formulaic and one-dimensional in earlier books are given complexity in later ones. Dumbledore is wise and knowing in the first books, and his actions make sense in context of the children\u2019s book style of his portrayal, but later we discover that he had a relationship with Grindelwald, was partially responsible for the death of his own sister, etc. This added complexity and fallibility in his portrayal opens things up for the reader to reexamine their understanding of his character and actions in previous books, and to find him wanting. \n\nThe later books in the series are *not* children\u2019s books in any meaningful sense, and a large part of the fandom are adults, and Dumbledore\u2019s character suffers significantly from that change in perspective.", "created_utc": "1589333820.0", "edited": "False", "id": "fqfxsfe", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_gimadr", "parent_id": "t3_gimadr", "score": "169", "subreddit": "HPfanfiction", "subreddit_id": "t5_2t100"}, {"author": "LiathGray", "body": "Awesome!

I don\u2019t reach for Soft Glam much either, mostly because if I want to do a straight up neutral look I tend to reach for one of my smaller palettes (trio, quad, 6-pan) because I usually just want to slap it on and not have to think about it much.", "created_utc": "1578441700.0", "edited": "False", "id": "fdifgc4", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_eljy7u", "parent_id": "t3_eljy7u", "score": "7", "subreddit": "MakeupAddiction", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rww2"}, {"author": "LiathGray", "body": "I got this last month.

One, I wouldn\u2019t use coconut oil as a moisturizer. It\u2019s kind of like vaseline - it\u2019s a decent protectant, but it may break you out, and since it doesn\u2019t really get absorbed by the skin it\u2019s okay at keeping moisture in but it won\u2019t help make your skin more hydrated on its own.\n\nYou might try different application techniques. Brushes, sponges, fingers all have different effects - and different things work with different products. Start with just a little bit of product and build slowly. You might try sheering the foundation out by mixing with a moisturizer.\n\nMaybe your foundation isn\u2019t the right product for you. Something like a skin tint or tinted moisturizer might work better for your tastes. Some people just spot conceal and don\u2019t use a foundation at all. Alternatively, you might try something like rcma foundations - it\u2019s super pigmented so you can get really good coverage from a ridiculously small amount of product.\n\nWork skincare first, imo - especially exfoliating and moisturizing. Getting rid of underlying texture can help things lay better. Then consider whether you want to use a product under the foundation - primer, powder, etc.  Try spot concealing and using less foundation than you think you need - you don\u2019t necessarily need the full face masking effect to get a base that looks good with other make-up. A lot of times you can get perfectly nice looking results from just a subtle evening out of your skin tone and concealing any significant trouble spots.\n\nHope some of that helps!", "created_utc": "1578440312.0", "edited": "False", "id": "fdidb8h", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_eliksp", "parent_id": "t3_eliksp", "score": "4", "subreddit": "MakeupAddiction", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rww2"}, {"author": "LiathGray", "body": "Yikes. \n\nYeah, I'm sticking with the base boxy from now on, if anything at all.

It's often just more expensive. I got a fancy tube of skincare stuff in a subscription box. Based on the label I was confused about what it was even for, but it sure sounded fancy.

How about 5 oz. of Kopari 100% coconut oil - only $28 at Ulta! (Or, you know, you could buy a half-gallon of organic coconut oil at Costco for $12, your choice).\n\n  \nExpensive skincare tends to have more ingredients, more exotic ingredients, and more active ingredients.

I have eight Coach purses, as well as a few more from other mid-range designers. That's hugely excessive to some people and absolutely nothing to others. I've spent $900 on a bag, but still think it's insane to spend more than $300 on a pair of boots, $50 on an eyeshadow palette, or $30 on a pair of jeans. All of these numbers are totally arbitrary, and other people will draw their lines differently depending on their priorities and their budgets. A pretty bag, or a pair of boots that are still going strong after more than five years of heavy use both make me happy, but I don't care much about other clothes so I'm totally happy wearing pants and shirts from Wal-Mart or Costco.\n\nThe internet is a judgemental place. It's easy to criticize people you don't know. \n\nThere are a lot of wasteful and problematic aspects of a lot of industries. Unless you're living in a cave, growing all your own food, wearing clothes you grew yourself, and not driving or using any other technology, I guarantee you're supporting some of them. Cheap clothes are manufactured in countries with minimal workers' rights or protections. Mexican avocados support organized crime and contributes to water shortages in some areas. Computers, cellphones, and many other electronics have huge environmental footprints. \n\nEven things people do with the thought of trying to help others can have negative consequences that we may not understand for years after the fact. Recycling plastic contributes to trash mountains and air pollution in Asia because most plastic is actually not readily recyclable even if we collect it. Donating fast fashion clothing to first world charities has destroyed the local textile economies in many more impoverished nations.\n\nI work in healthcare and you would not believe the amount of waste plastic that is produced by caring for a single patient for a single surgery or day as an inpatient. If a patient is on contact precautions, one staff member may gown up 20 times in a single shift - 20 disposable gowns, umpteen more sets of gloves, hairnets. Single-use medical tubing, patient-specific blood pressure cuffs and stethoscopes...\n\nPersonal responsibility and consumption matter, but waste in our society is systemic. Shaming individuals for their habits might help people feel self-righteous and better about their own consumption patterns, but it doesn't actually accomplish anything at the macro level.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTl;dr version: life\u2019s complicated, do what makes you happy, screw the haters.", "created_utc": "1577502537.0", "edited": "1577503729.0", "id": "fc7bd5f", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_egbleb", "parent_id": "t3_egbleb", "score": "1", "subreddit": "Makeup", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qrwc"}, {"author": "LiathGray", "body": "True story, my boyfriend sees it after I turned it into a box and immediately goes, \u201chey, I bet my gun will fit in there!\u201d\n\nAnd it does.\n\nBecause that\u2019s what I always wanted in my life.
