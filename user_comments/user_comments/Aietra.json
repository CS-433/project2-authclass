That gives the explanation of him that he *was* what the thirteenth Doctor would have been, but Time and Death and their sisters tore him out of his regenerative cycle to play a part in their little feud.  So he *was* a future potential Doctor, who hasn't yet lived but has been made mostly corporeal by being detached a bit like a Watcher.  *That* version of a thirteenth Doctor can no longer exist, but the frayed end of the Doctor's regenerative cycle and life that could-have-been would eventually be filled in by some unknown future as the Doctor, Time's Champion, shapes his own path.  So, we still get \"Name of the Doctor\", Whittaker-Thirteen, etc. and that's all fine.\n\nThat Valeyard was around for a while on Gallifrey, as Keeper of the Matrix - so \"Trial of the Valeyard\" can still happen.  \"Time's Champion\" actually rewrote a part of the timeline at Six's regeneration to keep a time-loop intact, so \"The Last Adventure\" can still happen.  At the end of that, fragments of a very broken Valeyard became the very broken version from \"Matrix\".  \"He Jests at Scars\" is a branched timeline that will eventually collapse and heal into a more stable (read: TV-canon) version of the Web of Time.  And the Valeyard at the Trial made such a strong impression on the Sixth Doctor that he hung around in the Doctor's subconscious for a long time, so various aberrations along the way manifested into other temporary Valeyards, which we see in \"Millennial Rites\" and \"The War Valeyard\" for starters.\n\nNone of these are headcanon - they're all specified within their narratives that that's how they fit.

It's sometimes done for making lower strengths or smaller versions of medications for really tiny patients, for instance.  There's one medication in particular (an eye drop, actually - now I'm wondering if it's the same one) that we have some patients on for life, who need repeats every so often, so we'll make up a dozen or so bottles of it to stock in our dispensary.  Every medication has to have a clearly identifying label on it, with date, drug name, concentration, vet, etc. - and the easiest way to make those, rather than someone sitting and handwriting it on every bottle, is to print off a bunch of labels with a single push of a button, which has all of the required information, and \"Internal Account\" as the animal/patient name.\n\nNow this is all perfectly legal to do, and to store in-house.  What *wouldn't* be legal, is if I were then to dispense it with just that label on it.  Every prescription drug dispensed has to have the name of the patient, the name of the owner, and clear instructions for how to use it.  So when I prescribe these bottles, I make a new label with the legal prescription, and stick it over the top.\n\nSo I wonder if perhaps LAOP's doctor is doing something similar, and the only thing wrong is a stuff-up where someone forgot to put the patient prescription label on it.\n\nAlso I feel like a doctor writing fake prescriptions with nefarious intentions wouldn't go about it this way, by handing patients obviously-fake things with their own name and address plastered on it.  \n\nTechnically illegal?

Spend an afternoon just doing every single lesson from the very beginning, right through the tree.  The very first few lessons will be like a bit of a warmup - \"le pain\", \"bonjour\", \"je suis v\u00e9t\u00e9rinaire\", \"je mange du chocolat\", etc.  Have a notebook and pen beside you.  Then, whenever you encounter something you don't know or can't quite fully remember, or struggle with in any way, write it down.  \"conjugating -ir verbs\", \"numbers above 60\", \"pass\u00e9 imparfait\", etc.\n\nGet as far as you can through the tree doing this, and then you'll have yourself a very specific, measurable list of things to look up individually via more detailed other sources to read up on and learn.\n\n(You could use Duolingo as your primary source for learning once you've done that, if you like - it works well for some people - depends on the learning style, I think.  But mostly, you're just using it as a tool to break down \"FRENCH\" into a manageable list of what you do and don't know in bite-sized bits.)\n\nEditing to add: use the web browser version, not the mobile app, so you don't have to deal with the hearts system.

I enjoyed them - I liked the feeling of accomplishment as they got easier and easier, as time went on.  I'd do a progress quiz every three rows of lessons, or so, and there was a graph where you could see your scores mapped over time.  I didn't really notice their absence much when they were removed from free Duo, though.  Instead, I found short stories, fanfictions and books in my target languages, and enjoyed the same feelings of progress going back to them intermittently and seeing how much further I could read before having to look up much.  As for Duo, I feel like the checkpoints now give a similar type of measurable assessment on the site.  Progress quizzes were a neat little feature, and I'm surprised they've got rid of them entirely for free users (I would've thought maybe, say, one free one a month, or something like that, would be reasonable - if you're going to learn a language, you've got to be able to test yourself, surely) - but I wouldn't pay just to have them back.\n\nOn the whole, I think if I were to pay for a premium subscription, it'd be if I had some extra change to spare one month and wanted to support Duolingo, kind of more to feel like I was giving back to something I've had so much use and enjoyment out of, rather than any major benefit to me.

An evil Doctor is the Doctor, and the Doctor doesn't concoct meticulous plans and lay everything out and follow it to the letter, like the Master does.  The Doctor is an improviser, the Doctor jumps in and makes it all up as he goes along, the Doctor has no idea what he's about to do next half the time.  That's the Valeyard - and it...doesn't go well for him.  At all.  Villains can be scary when they're in control of everything, but \"He Jests at Scars\" proves that the very opposite sort of villain can be even more terrifying in their own way.  The Valeyard is the epitome of \"always fear the incompetent swordsman\", and it's a glorious and macabre train wreck that you just can't tear your eyes away from.  \n\n* \"Seizure\" - from Ravenous vol. 2.

So I read things in those languages whenever I see them, just paying close attention to the grammar and sentence structures and the like, and I build my vocabulary by writing.  Before, I was using posts like the Babylonian Chaos one, to find other people learning those languages and chat to them - now, I write a paragraph or so for these writing prompts I'm posting, and then write the same thing in each of those three languages, looking up new words that I need for each of them and learning them as I go.  \n\nFor Chinese, I'm working my way through the Duolingo course to start with, but I've got a flashcard set on Memrise that I practise with, adding each new word I come across to it - since Memrise offers audio samples, because I need both sound and typing for Chinese characters, since it's not phonetic.\n\nFor Te Reo, I worked my way through an introductory course on an app called Tipu, and now I'm (very slowly!) going through a podcast series called T\u014dku Reo.
