I know a human with cerebral palsy caused by brain damage after a lack of oxygen at birth. She's grown up with a consistently weaker and less coordinated right side of her body, though she's perfectly able to walk with a limp. \n\nIt's a neurological issue- the muscles are fine but they're weak through poor control from her brain. She can build muscle if she tries but her brain doesn't push those muscles especially hard. She uses a machine to electrically exercise the muscles so her brain doesn't have to. It's a lifelong disability but it won't deteriorate and it doesn't affect her lifespan.\n\nI'm no goatologist (or humanologist for that matter) but I imagine that could also be a possible cause of your kid's problems. If so, it might be a lifelong affliction but she'll live a full happy life as she is.", "created_utc": "1642813454.0", "edited": "False", "id": "htogw0s", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_s9cawf", "parent_id": "t1_htmsoay", "score": "4", "subreddit": "goats", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qlyf"}, {"author": "MokausiLietuviu", "body": "I'm not a goaty person, but I can only imagine that her play with you is valuable, especially when she's not getting it elsewhere.

In case you're unaware, the 3200g is an APU - that is a processor with a built in graphics card (the graphics card being the most expensive bit at the moment) and it's a low-end choice from the previous generation of processors (so it might be a bit cheaper).\n\nBecause of the current silicon shortages, all parts are expensive right now and you'll struggle to get a 150\u20ac PC brand new which can play that, but if you look used you might do fine. I realise that buying used parts might be a bit more daunting but it'd definitely get you a bit more.   \n\n\nA 3200g processor would be a good option for a few reasons:\n\n* Last-generation low-end (might be easier to find used)\n* Upgradeable (the motherboard you'd get would likely offer you an extensive CPU upgrade path if you choose to spend more money down the line)\n* Built-in graphics (no graphics card needed - but you could upgrade to a graphics card down the line)\n\nSo let's look at a homebuilt 3200g based system. You'll need to buy:\n\n* The AMD Ryzen 3 3200g processor itself. Get it used.\n   * Note - this should come with the stock \"Wraith Stealth\" cooler. If it doesn't you'll need to find another cooler but assuming the CPU comes with it, you should do fine.\n* The motherboard - almost any \"AM4\" motherboard will do you. Again, used is fine. Before buying it, check it's either a) compatible with the 3200g on its website and b) if it is, that whoever's selling it has updated the firmware so that they'll work together (if it's an old one)\n* The RAM - get at least 8GB (size) of DDR4 (type). Used is fine. Any less and you won't really be able to play, but more is better (16gb is strictly unnecessary but a nice QOL improvement). If you have the option of 1 stick of 8gb or 2 sticks of 4gb, go with the 2 sticks.\n* The SSD/HDD - an SSD is a massive improvement over an HDD, but a price increase too. You can cheap out and get used here but beware, only so long as you realise that it might be less reliable and \\*you might lose all your data\\*. Just store nothing important on it and if it's just for F:NV, back up your save files. \n* The case - Cheapest you can get. Unless it's Dell/HP or some other prebuilt brand, you should be fine with whatever your local charity shop is selling.\n* The power supply - here is the one thing I don't suggest cheaping out on. It doesn't need to be big (the 3200g supposedly draws 65W of power) so a small power supply would do you, but the low wattage ones are typically made by dodgy manufacturers so it's worth overspeccing it. Look for a 450w PSU from a reputable manufacturer. If you happen to get a bigger power supply than you need, this is okay. Whatever you get, I [suggest you refer to this list of manufacturers and models](https://forums.tomshardware.com/threads/psucultists-psu-tier-list-rev-14-8-final-update-jul-21.3624094/) to see whether or not what you're getting is worth is. Theoretically, a shit PSU can fry the rest of your system.\n* The screen - obviously a PC monitor offers better PC-like features but this will almost certainly blow your budget. I suggest you don't get one and you hook it up to whatever screen you're playing the playstation with.\n* Mouse and keyboard - at a 150\u20ac budget, beg, borrow, steal, or go with whatever you can get from a charity shop. \n\nIf building your own PC is too daunting, I suggest you look a buying an old cheap used Dell or HP office pc such as a Dell Optiplex and making the best of it [in line with this video by Linus Tech Tips.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56MgVgnRBSs)\n\nThis \\*will\\* take you luck with ebay listings etc, but given that luck, you should be able to build yourself a 150\u20ac PC to play.

Now remove one of those electrons, and the place it's been removed from is more positive (less negative). Let's call this a hole.\n\nNow imagine there's a positive charge to the left of this. The electron to the right will be attracted to that positive charge, leading it to enter the hole left by the previous electron, but also leading a hole behind *it*. The electron to the right of the new hole will flow into it... and the cycle repeats, shifting the hole rightwards.\n\nSo what we have is a thing called a hole that carries positive charge and can flow. You can, in semiconductor land, model this as its own positive-charge-carrying particle with a mass (i.e. given to it by the inertial mass of the electrons that need to flow to move the hole).", "created_utc": "1636090073.0", "edited": "1636090297.0", "id": "hjdrna7", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_qmidgc", "parent_id": "t1_hjcykpz", "score": "4", "subreddit": "ElectricalEngineering", "subreddit_id": "t5_2sey9"}, {"author": "MokausiLietuviu", "body": "The issue there comes when the appointment type is misclassified.
