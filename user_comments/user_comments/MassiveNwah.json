Repeat this many times over a month or two as you put them out for sale and you're golden. Given that bedding and hanging basket plants are only really grown to be sold in small three inch pots or to be made up into pre-planted baskets we don't have to worry about when they are big.\n\nBut if you just take a few flowers off a day, or pinch back any fresh stems with more than a few nodes then the plant will be compact and floriferous.\n\nPlants grown from seed, especially at home, will always be leggier because they are given more space than nurseries which cram as many as possible in a tray, or use plug sockets. These germinate and are shipped off to small garden centre nurseries to grow on individually.\n\nRemember taking less off now is taking more away from you a fortnight from now, bedding plants **need** to be a little stressed from the pinching out to start making flowers en masse.
