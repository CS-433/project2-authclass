Yes it does, actually!    I'll take a moment to write up my understanding after a thorough read.  \n\nThere are some interesting things in there about, for example, controlling for the BASE level of people moving.  Blaming gentrification for mass exodus when much of that is just \"people moving around\", doesn't hold up.  \n\nIt also suggests that people move to similar, and not worse, places.  That's basically what I said, so that lines up with my assumptions.  I feel they are forced to move laterally, but with the added costs of moving.  Paying for no upgrade, as it were.  But again, the base rate of moving is also high, so maybe this isn't as dramatic an effect of gentrification as I assumed.  \n\nI still have concerns over it.  For example I wonder if gentrification has lower than expected effect on moving people OUT, and yet still exercises a strong filter who can move IN.  Affordable housing helps, or I assume it does.  Assuming again.  :)\n\nI also wonder if the idea that people move to similar and not worse areas, is only measuring crime and poverty, and not access to jobs.  In Seattle we have seen gentrification of areas with good access to the city core, either by proximity or by transit nodes, and some displacement to more distant suburbs.  Even if those places are equal in many ways, they aren't completely equal.  This is more a methodological nit.  \n\nAnd another:  The proxy of education for income may be tricky.  People with similar education can earn vastly different amounts.   I worry about the implied precision of a statement like \"Brummet and Reed estimate the average poverty rate of neighborhoods that gentrified declined by 3 percentage points\", when using educational proxies.  Older people with older BS degrees may make much less than younger tech-employed folks with BS degrees.  While this may average out over large populations, I worry about this proxy when it comes to specific neighborhoods where major employers are a driving force in the incoming residents' composition.  E.g. Microsoft in the 1990s on the Eastside, or Amazon more recently in Seattle proper.  \n\nAnd yet, nits aside, despite the normal human way that \"unexpected info\" triggers all my critical thinking, I'll admit that this does raise some interesting questions about our gentrification assumptions.  I'll also say that I don't think we should wait for an area to completely fall apart before allowing renewal.  (Although \"urban renewal\" itself is a term with a lot of baggage).\n\nThanks for encouraging me to take a deeper look.  I feel like I owe you an upvote an a minimum.   It's just one study, and it disagrees with \"common sense\", but I am big believer in data over \"common sense\", even when it's MY common sense being questioned.  \n\nI'd LIKE to believe it, since I think stopping gentrification is also unrealistic and harmful long-term to the entire city, including poor residents.", "created_utc": "1668043500.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ivre92j", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_yn1ccr", "parent_id": "t1_iv8bxbz", "score": "1", "subreddit": "Seattle", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhad"}, {"author": "platitood", "body": "Thank you, very helpful!", "created_utc": "1668042225.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ivrbh06", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_yla68s", "parent_id": "t1_iuzxmoo", "score": "1", "subreddit": "German", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qq51"}, {"author": "platitood", "body": ">A train cannot enter a properly signaled intersection until the proceeding train has cleared both the intersection and the following block.\n\nOh, true.

These destroyers would tow barges or be laden with floating containers, and sometimes even would carry hundreds of troops as part of these reinforcement plans.

They were so named because the word for yes was \u201c o\u00efl\", which over time has become \u201coui\u201d.  These dial wax covered roughly what is northern and northwestern France today.\n\nIn 1789 people throughout this region would have spoken heavily accented dialects of this language.  \u201cStandard\u201d French would have been used in the capital and the area around it, and was also the official language of the court and legal proceedings, having replaced Latin in the 16th century.   The educated population would have been able to communicate in standard French.  \n\nSouthern half of France would have had a large population of \u201c langue d'oc\u201d / Occitan speakers.  This was another widespread set of dialect group together because the word for US was some varioairon of \u201coc\u201d, which was derived from the Latin \u201choc\u201d.  Again educated people and government officials would have been able to communicate in standard French. \n\nAll of these dialects were fully functioning. Every day language is for the people that spoke them. I have the center of political power been elsewhere, then, one of these other dialects from the north or south could have developed into the standard national language. The political power, and the accumulated cultural power, happened to be centered in Paris.  By cultural power, I mean, the bulk of courtly poems and histories and other literary works, as well as scholarly works, tended to be written in what became standard French. \n\nIn addition, different bits and pieces of what today make up modern France had some languages spoken in numbers, much larger than they are today   Breton, German dialects like Alsatian, Corsican, Basque.   \n\nThe driving force behind French standardization was originally the simple power of the court, and its ability to decree I. The 16th century  that French, as spoken in the capital, was the official language for law in education.  Knowing standard French, and speaking, it properly became important tools for political and social advancement.   \n\nIn 1789 you would still have stop had millions of average people speaking a local dialect, including varieties of Occitan.  Republican and then Imperial France, as with so many other aspects of French, life and culture, made an attempt to rationalize and standardize the French language. Even so, it took a protracted effort by the French bureaucracy to try to stamp out Occitan.  It was for bidden in schools and both children and adults for ashamed for using it  \n\nToday, some of these small languages are undergoing a revival. As always, there\u2019s a risk that an insufficient number of true native speakers will cause the language to mutate into a curiosity or die out entirely.   \n\nI don\u2019t have as much information on other countries, but I do know that a similar diversity of dialect existed in Italy, and in Spain  both countries went through processes of language, standardization, and often used some of the same tools of coercion and shame to replace the dialects with \u201cgood\u201d languages. \n\nI know that in Spain, there has been definite pushback from, for example, Catalan speakers, who maintain the value and having their own language remain, and have a body of literature, which helps support that effort.  \n\n Keep in mind that the distinction between a dialect and a separate language is often very subjective, based on political power, and sometimes based on the fact that we know how the story plays out.

When I was 42 I was fortunate enough to be able to spend a month doing language study in Germany. \n\nOver the past 17 years I would say that I have spent the equivalent of about one year of normal study on German. There\u2019s been a lot of time in between when I was too busy. So, a solid year study, and I feel like I am somewhere between B1 and B2.\n\n I can travel to Germany and do what I need to do, even if sometimes it takes a little bit of repetition.  Many people will switch to English especially if they are serving a busy line of customers. But I\u2019ve had plenty of conversations with German people in German, and enjoyed the experience.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of discussion about brain plasticity and how easy it is for kids to learn languages, and there certainly is some truth to that. One of the things that made me go back to language study when I was 40, was that I read an article about someone who explained how they continue to learn new languages well into their 60s. They laid out some behavioral aspects that children take advantage of, which have nothing to do with brain plasticity. \n\nChildren put in the hours. Almost none of us have the luxury to put in that many hours learning a language as an adult, but it does make it seem less magic and intimidating\n\nChildren are immersed.  This is something that most adults can do a bit in the passive sentence by watching German TV reading German newspapers etc.  The part that\u2019s harder for adults is to immerse themselves by making the language an everyday tool.  But you can take some steps if you make the effort. For example let\u2019s say that you like to join book clubs and talk about books you\u2019ve read. Could you find an online book club in German? Maybe not right away.  If you\u2019d like to go for a walk around the lake once a week, could you try to find somebody who\u2019s willing to do that with you and converse in German? What if you had to pay them $15 to do it? Still worth it.  Immersion in a language sense doesn\u2019t just mean surrounding yourself with it, it means that you use it. \n\nChildren, unless they\u2019re being brought up in an environment that is rather cruel, are usually bold and shameless and their use of language even when they don\u2019t 100% understand what they\u2019re doing. Children don\u2019t wait until they perfected a word to use it. Children don\u2019t stop to question their grammar every time they want to ask for a treat or to go to the playground. Children unconsciously take chances. Now again that\u2019s easier for children because they often have a supportive environment with adults that will gently correct them, and adult learners don\u2019t usually have a fluent German speaker willing to follow them around all day and tell them the names of animals and what color the sky is. \n\nMight take away from this guys numeration of these things was, holy shit it is definitely not easy for an adult to reproduce the learning environment a child has. But perhaps more importantly, these are not magical things that biology has taken away from you. There wasn\u2019t some expiration date on learning languages necessarily. Something being difficult is different than something being impossible.\n\nSo. Put in the hours. Find ways to use the language as a tool, and not just for its own sake. Be courageous and use the language when you have an opportunity to do so.  \n\nAnyway I don\u2019t know if you find that inspiring as I did.

Specifically a call center is that used to deal with customer support often has much lower staffing these days because companies will direct people to use the web, and because even before you get to a caller you have to jump through a bunch of prompts and somewhat non-intelligent systems that will try to solve common problems for you.  \n\nMany large companies also use distributed call centers where people work from home. My sister-in-law was one of those people. She worked for a company which in turn contracted services to Amazon. She was required to have a Comcast business Internet connection, which is more expensive but in theory more reliable. She was provided with a dedicated computer that wasn\u2019t to be used for personal stuff, and used a VOIP-enabled System that would route calls to her. She would talk people through questions about their orders or even questions about specific products. She did all this without leaving her bedroom.  It sounds a little freaky but, she was required to have a full background check and they had pretty good supervision of her work. They really do monitor calls for quality. So don\u2019t freak out about this little tidbit of trivia, she actually was really good at solving problems for people and it seems like the contractor did a good job of vetting the people they hired to do the job.\n\nNow in this case they have not actually gotten rid of a person. But, they have got rid of a full-time employee and made it into a contract position.

In effect, the technology of the Internet has enabled them to be more efficient with their staffing and serve the same peak load of callers. \n\nThis means that instead of over staffing their call-center slightly, they can do what amounts to just in time staffing.

They are concentrated in the UK, and especially England itself, because English spread from there.   \n\nOne linguistic tool to pinpointed geographic heartland of a language is to look for exactly this level of diversity. It has parallels in biology, where one way to find the \u201chomeland\u201d of an organism is to look for the location with a great number of closely related species or variants.  In both cases it is because they have processes that increase variation with time.  \n\nIn the modern era there are a couple of forces that are disrupting the ancient patterns of linguistic change and diversity.\n\n Writing changed the patterns by which languages evolved, although as long as writing was mostly a tool of an elite subset, it wasn\u2019t nearly enough to stop language changing. Latin gave rise to Italian and French and Spanish despite writing existing. But in later years as literacy increased, writing also helped to keep people using the same words and mostly, just mostly, pronouncing them the same way. They need for various spelling reforms in many languages shows that in fact it wasn\u2019t a perfect constraint.  Likewise the many changes in meaning of words from the last few centuries, some of which cause confusion in Shakespeare because the same word exists but doesn\u2019t have the same meaning, attest to the fact that language still changed despite it being written. But writing arguably slowed the pace of change. \n\nNationalism, central governments, and policies that rewarded the officially designated dialect and were another big step.  These tended to kill off entire languages!  Not everybody in France spoke French, let alone the Parisian dialect of French, but national policies led to a great reduction in speakers of Oic and Breton and such. \n\nAnother big influence has been the ability to hear people speak from afar on a regular basis. National news broadcasts. Television. Radio before that.  Again none of these were 100% able to wipe out dialect, and some of them even incorporate dialect into the entertainment. But at a minimum these sort of media tended to spread comprehension of the main standard national dialect. So, many people became able to \u201ccode switch\u201d between the dialect they grew up with, and the more prestigious main dialect that was needed for business or government or simply speaking to somebody from a different part of your own country.", "created_utc": "1665215969.0", "edited": "1665216156.0", "id": "irhv1fq", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_xyerf1", "parent_id": "t1_irhrv91", "score": "5", "subreddit": "German", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qq51"}, {"author": "platitood", "body": "Where are you from?

I just got back from Hamburg.  you can say that it doesn\u2019t work for you, but please don\u2019t be insulting that I am giving you a theoretical method. This is what I do when I travel to Germany. I purposefully don\u2019t bring my normal reading materials with me because I use the time I normally would sit by myself and read on trains, waiting for trains, standing in line, or dining solo; to seek out conversations. And it works. In practice. \n\nI don\u2019t know maybe I\u2019m just more charismatic than you guys or something? Which I\u2019m saying sarcastically because I\u2019m a 59-year-old overweight guy. But unless I run into the limits of my vocabulary I have absolutely no problem getting people to continue speaking me with me in German.  \n\nI\u2019m seriously curious about what the difference is. Are you folks mostly young people talking to other young people who are desperately polishing their English so they can travel to North America for ski season?  Are you only talking to people in customer service jobs? Are you only talking to people who are working at an international company and desperately trying to improve their skills to get posted overseas? I\u2019m wondering why you guys are having a vastly different experience than I am. \n\n I\u2019m talking to a broad variety of Germans, on purpose, striking up conversations with other people on the train platforms and other people visiting museums. I am targeting regular people with my conversational gambits. I get about 75% rejection rate because people have other things to do or they\u2019re suspicious that I\u2019m out to scam them or something. But the other 25% talk with me in German, even to the point where if I stumble a bit they will help me with a new word using English to explain it, and then switch back to German.  \n\nI even have a decent success rate with customer service people. Airport security. Doner kebab counter. Ticket taker. Taxi.  In those cases if they switch to English I don\u2019t even ask because I\u2019m not about to slow down somebody\u2019s job.\n\nAnd let me stipulate, I agree that your method is most effective for improving your German.

I think it\u2019s impolite for me to substitute my own judgment on this.  \n\nI\u2019ve just come back from a week in hamburg. I assure you that there are plenty of Germans who knew right away that I was American and continued to speak with me in German because my vocabulary was adequate to the task.  Several of them complimented me on my German, which I say not to demonstrate how good my German is, but rather how polite they were and that they didn\u2019t switch to English just because there was a hint of an accent.\n\nThe times when they offered immediately to switch to English or switched to English without asking, or all cases where I knew that I was on thin ice anyway. Sometimes it was the topic of conversation. Sometimes it was just me being nervous, like getting asked extra questions at passport control.  \n\nAnyway I think maybe our main points of difference is that I don\u2019t see a lot of Germans switching on me arbitrarily. I feel like when they\u2019re doing it, they\u2019re giving me a solid hint that language has become a hurdle and they are showing me the easy path.

This layout will let you run some trains continuously, and move trains into and out of the yard.  It won't \"switch\" too well.  Operations will be very limited.  **So: run two trains at a time, and show off a bunch of mostly static cars in the yard.

Prisons filled up, and ships in harbor were used as floating prisons.  These ships were often in terrible condition, unsuitable for maritime use, and were considered even more unhealthy than normal prisons.  A few experiments were made transporting convicts to tropical locations as labor, but death from disease was frequent and rapid, and local or slave labor was usually deemed more efficient.

If you are asking, why are some more unstable, then you're getting into some cool physics.  \n\nIn general large atoms are less stable, because **the forces that hold the nucleus together weaken with distance**. This means quantum events can create a situation where the nucleus splits into two more stable atoms, usually releasing other particles / energy as well.\n\nIt seems that once you get beyond a certain size, atoms decay rapidly.  The heaviest elements, created in labs, exist for tiny fractions of a second.  Their creation is tricky and existence is short.   \nFor example, when Copernicium was created it was statistically likely that those atoms were the only atoms of Copernicium in our entire galaxy. Those atoms decayed in milliseconds.  \n\nEven among \"normal\" heavy atoms, there are some configurations that are less stable than others.  Atoms of the same element (same number of protons) can exist with different *isotopes*, because of different numbers of neutrons.  Some ass less stable and thus more radioactive and more likely to decay.    But the effect is that, **some sizes, and some proportions of neutrons to protons, are more or less stable than others**.  \n\nThe half-life of uranium 238 is of 4.5 billion years, while uranium 235 has a half-life of \u2018only\u2019 700 million years.  The *isotope* U-235, which has 3 fewer neutrons than U-238, is inherently less stable.  The exact \"why\" requires learning some math that is beyond my skills to explain.  Why would the *isotope* that's heavier be more stable, when in general heavier elements are less stable?

In the period 1846 - 1895, changes occured which resulted in the entire area being consolidated into one municipal government.   The key moment was the [Organic Act of 1871](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_of_Columbia_Organic_Act_of_1871), \"which revoked the individual charters of the cities of Washington and Georgetown and combined them with Washington County to create a unified territorial government for the entire District of Columbia. The new government consisted of an appointed governor and 11-member council, a locally elected 22-member assembly, and a board of public works charged with modernizing the city.\"\n\nSubsequent changes through 1895 included renaming streets to match the existing grid and repealing or rationalizing existing zoning laws etc. left over from Georgetown, Washington (the independent city), and Washington County.\n\nAt that point in history, there was no longer a separate \"district\" and \"capital city\".  There was just \"Washington, DC\", a federal city without a state.  In many ways the residents were less empowered than those in the regular states.  They had no representation in the legislature even though that legislature controlled their city.  They had no vote for President.\n\nThere were further changes.  In the 1960s the District got some electoral votes for president, but still no presence in the national legislature.  In 1970s, limited Home Rule was passed with an elected mayor, and less direct control over the daily business of \"the city\" by Congress.  BUT:  Congress maintains supreme authority over the city and may overturn local laws.\n\nSo ... pretty close.

The object, if present, is PART of the predicate.**\n\n**The object is optional,** depending on the verb.  For *intransitive verbs* it is (nearly) always omitted.\n\n* He cried.  \n* I stood.  \n* She bathed.  \n* The ice cream melted.\n* The wizard slept\n\nThere is no object.  Many languages use a reflexive pronoun with these types of verbs or a subset of them.  English seldom (if ever) requires one.  \"She bathed herself\" is fine.  \"I stood myself up\" sounds colloquial or regional.  \"He cried himself to sleep\" is a stock phrase.  English has these reflexive pronouns, just way fewer strict uses of them.\n\nNote that many of these same verbs can become transitive as well.\n\n* He cried many tears. \n* I stood the statue on its head.  \n* She bathed the dog. \n* The fire melted the ice.\n* *The final one is tricky because, outside of a DND spell, I can't think of a transitive use of \"slept\".*  \"The wizard slept the two smallest goblins\". \n\nYou can even use a transitive verb and omit the object.  \"I fired\" implies an object, probably a gun, but it can be omitted if the context allows.  This is still grammatically correct English.\n\nBut... **you do need a subject, and the verb part of the predicate**.  Sentence fragments can be used, but are not grammatically correct.  \"How did you get here?\"  \"Walked\".  The implied subject \"I\" is omitted; but unlike some languages, English considers that ungrammatical.  People do it constantly in conversational English, of course.  \n\nOne last weird bit.  In English, the verb \"to be\" doesn't take a direct object, but a *complement*.   So in the sentence \"Bob is *a centaur*\", the italitc part is the complement.  The complement is in nominative case, not accusative, but you can hardly tell ... until you use pronouns.  \"Bob is not the centaur.  The centaur is I.\"  Now of course, it's more common in spoken English to say \"The centaur is me\", or just say \"I am the centaur\".

They did not focus on attempts to intercept convoys of merchant shipping.  There were some attempts by the Japanese submarines to take the war to the enemy homeland, but they were more oddball technological efforts like submarines that could carry small airplanes to bomb the enemy homeland. These never amounted to much.\n\nIn terms of using surface raider ships, the Japanese did have some early success in the Indian ocean. However as the war progressed, the Japanese actually brought some of those ships back into uses transports. So in fact as the war went along, the Japanese did less merchant raiding not more. \n\nAside from Japanese naval doctrine, a reason why is that the Pacific Ocean is huge. The area that the Japanese would have been required to patrol and the ranges that they would have required these ships to have, dwarfed the needs of the battle of the Atlantic. Whereas the Germans had, by late 1940s, the ability to base maritime patrol aircraft and surface ships and uboats out of both France and Norway; and at least at the beginning of the war had some hope of using neutral ports in South America and Africa for resupplying commerce raiders, the Japanese would have had to cover vastly larger distances   \n\nIt\u2019s also worth noting two things. First, the United States implemented a aggressive system of submarine warfare almost immediately, that played havoc with Japanese shipping. These boats did so despite initial problems with torpedo war heads that resulted in a lot of wasted shots. These boats went on very long patrols deep into enemy territory, and many were lost.  As the war progressed the United States aggressively attacked Japanese transports whenever possible using air power.  So, the United States was much more involved in destroying Japanese merchant shipping than the other way around.  And unlike Germany, the Japanese were highly dependent on shipping, both for bringing in extra resources, for movement of men in weapons around the Pacific theater, and even for coastal shipping of goods within the Japanese home islands \n\nThe second is that wartime production of naval assets was a very one-sided aspect of the war. Although the Japanese did continue they were construction, finishing a few major ships and building a certain amount of escorts in new merchant shipping, the United States not only replace early losses but built an incredible  number of new warships and merchant ships.  \n\nSo the short answer is: the Japanese understood the concept and saw how it had worked in World War I. They made some attempts at it with surface Raiders. Logistics and geography and doctrine conspired to put convoy rating on the back burner. Meanwhile, the United States was actually very active and disrupting Japanese merchant shipping\n\nedit: dozens of typos", "created_utc": "1662563458.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ingjxqq", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_x85qc1", "parent_id": "t3_x85qc1", "score": "69", "subreddit": "AskHistorians", "subreddit_id": "t5_2ssp3"}, {"author": "platitood", "body": "One comment and one question.\n\nIt as you\u2019ve given all whole lot of stuff here to justify what you\u2019re doing, but not enough information to get much good advice on it.

During eras when the US Army was often small and \"between wars\", the USMC, while also smaller, was deployed around the world with naval units and to remote bases.   It was often involved in battles, large and small, far from home.  \n\nAn early, famous example would be the detachment led by Decatur on the \"shores of Tripoli\" to burn a captured warship.\n\nA more extensive example would have been the use of USMC forces during the Boxer Rebellion.  Marines were deployed early in the crisis to defend the international legation, along with other nations' forces; and additional US Marines, along with some Navy and Army personnel, formed part of the international relief force.   Of course to an American character, the role of the US forces would have been prominent.  \n\nA USMC invasion of Guantanamo Cuba, during the Spanish American war, helped bring about the expulsion of Spain, independence of Cuba, and started an occupation of that harbor that continues to this very day.   \n\nThe USMC burnished its reputation for regular combat, in more standard fighting during WWI, where the USMC fought as infantry along side other US units, as well as British and French allies.  The most famous of these battles was Belleau Wood.   This was more of a standard fight and not a raid, invasion, etc.  However it did add to the reputation of the USMC as above-average soldiers.  Supposedly the official German reports called the Marines at Belleau Wood Teufel Hunden, and \"devil dog\" remains a term of pride for Marines. \n\nBut most of all, a character in 1936 might have been thinking of more recent, small-scale, closer-to-home actions.  Throughout the first few decades of the 20th century the USMC has deployed to several interventions in the Americas that collectively became known as The Banana Wars.  Combining the fervor of the Monroe Doctrine's idea that the USA had a duty to impose order on the Americans and shield the new world from European interference, and blatantly pro-US-business goals, the USA's policy towards governments throughout the Americas varied from coercive pressure to violent intervention and regime change.   The idea of \"the USA sweeping in suddenly\" was acted out by the USMC, in at least nine different nations over 30-some years, including a 20-year occupation of Nicaragua, bombardment and occupation of the city of Veracruz, occupation of Haiti for decades, support of the revolt that created a pliant Panama, etc.  All of this would have been as recent to 1936, as the War on Terror would be today.  \n\nIf this was Spielberg's work I would feel pretty sure that he knew about all this.  But I don't know if Kasdan or Lucas would have been as meticulous about what a 1936 character would think about the USMC.

Public outcry over misuse of public funds or profiteering in this regard seems to be perennial.  \n\nWith regards to America specifically, there is an inflection point after WWII when peacetime procurement and R&D goes from a relatively small process to an entire industry.  It's no coincidence that Eisenhower spoke about the \"military-industrial complex\".  \n\nDuring the 19th century the standard models for military innovation were driven by either internal goals of the military, or the efforts of private inventors who then attempted to sell the military on some new innovation.\n\nAn example of the former would be the development of the Dahlgren naval guns.   Young Lt John Dahlgren set out to design a modern, safer, high-powered naval gun as a direct result of the need he saw.  He contracted with private firms using government funds to cast guns of his design, and oversaw the testing of these guns.  Most of the guns were cast by private industry.  Dahlgren received royalty payments on guns made with his designs.\n\nAn example of the latter would be the Spencer repeating rifle.  Spencer pressed hard to get his invention adopted by the US Army, but was resisted by conservative forces within the Army and its Ordinance Department.  It eventually became a very popular weapon within the Army and the US Navy.  \n\nIn the second half of the 18th century, naval technology advanced rapidly.  Prior to this a \"battleship\" could be expected to be a minor improvement over previous ones, and would serve alongside older similar ships for decades, maintenance allowing.  But from 1860 onwards, there were several generations of warships that so outclassed the previous, that older ships were rapidly relegated to lesser duties, sold to second-tier naval powers, or scrapped.  Because ships were so expensive, and deemed so crucial to national power, these design debates and procurements became matters of widespread peacetime interest.   The processes themselves often remained highly technical, but the expenditures were debated in press and in legislatures.  The advent of armored steam-propelled ships, breech-loading guns, the Dreadnought-era ships, each produced a wave of national doubt, pride, panic, and spending.  Magazines and journals debated the value of battleships in the era of the self-propelled torpedo, or the battlecruiser concept.  In the USA specifically, naval expenditure was seen in light of America's appearance on the world stage.  \n\nThe design, though, was for the most part driven by military experts and executed by a combination of private and military builders.  The main exceptions being some innovations in submarines, and propulsion.   Innovations were designed, built, and tried.  Adoption was slow and conservative.  In this sense, \"R&D\" was still seen as a risk shared by the government and private inventors.  \n\nInnovation occurred in other areas, of course, but all of those areas seemed highlighted in naval applications.  Larger artillery.  Telegraphic communication.  Wireless communication.  Aerial observation. \n\nDuring WWI, the American procurement effort centered in quantity, taking a small peacetime army and making it large and well-trained and supplied enough to fight in Europe.  \n\nDuring and after WWI the center of innovation changed to aviation.  Rapid advancements in engine power-to-weight ratios, and material science, allowed aircraft to increase in speed, climb, and payload.  As with battleships previously, new generation of aircraft would tend to eclipse older ones.  Even at sea, aviation had a large influence.  For the first time, the see governments and especially the USA begin to enter into ongoing partnerships with private industry for ongoing innovation.  \n\nGovernment subsidies, in the form of peacetime military contracts and also US Mail contracts for airmail, were crucial to the development of the domestic aircraft industry.  Military requirements drove aircraft design.  From the beginning there were objections and questions from taxpayers and competitors.  There was a major scandal involving Air Mail contracts and the US Army Air Corps in the 1930s.  \n\nIn the interwar period, the Air Corps pioneering procurement procedures such as permanent liaisons at manufacturing facilities, a more formal RFP process, contracts that included specification for delivery of spare parts over time, etc.  For the most part these peacetime developments were seen as necessary, though as always \"waste\" was an issue, both real, and as a political football.  \n\nSo, WWII.  America becomes \"the arsenal of democracy\", and turns its massive and undamaged industry to military production.  And in some ways, never fully stops.\n\nWhen the war ends, the need for massive production of military goods ends. However, developments during the war suggest that an ongoing technological race exists, which exceeds the pace and scope of all previous ones.  It is seen as crucial to maintain a pace of research and development sufficient to protect the nation in peacetime.  Areas highlighted during or near the end of WWII include jet planes, advanced submarines, sonar, radar, encryption, rockets, and of course nuclear weapons.  \n\nThree things conspire to keep the military expenditures relatively high (although of course a huge drop occurs when the war ends).\n\nFirst, the aforementioned technologies are all developing quickly, and are all seen as crucial.\n\nSecond, the \"peace\" turns \"cold war\", making the need for a larger peacetime armed forces.\n\nThird, the more modern the weapons system, the less it seems wise to rely on making weapons and ammo and such just before or DURING a war.  With the speed and range of postwar planes, and later missiles, and with mechanized armies, wars might last days or weeks.  Complicated weapons mean you can't just ask the blacksmith to switch from horseshoes to muskets; it takes advanced factories to make a modern jet, and it takes ltoo long to make them once war starts.  You need them BEFORE war happens.  \n\nThe net result is the need to equip a relatively large peacetime army, with relatively NEW technology, refreshed often as tech develops.   Private industry, with rare exceptions, isn't interested in making HUGE speculative expenditures.  Instead, the R&D and procurement process becomes a permanent mode and an expensive one.  \n\nAll of the old tensions remain.  Divisions over dogma and policy, empire-building, por-barrel politics, private profit-taking, political posturing.   But now the speed of the cycle and the expense means the public cares more, or is made to care more,\n\nTechnology becomes a public obsession, manifested in the race for the sound barrier, for space, the moon, the north pole (by nuclear sub!).  So does failure of expensive weapons systems.  When it takes a decade to prefect a new design, obsolescence is a constant risk.  Costly dead-ends include the B-70, Star Wars, and the Sergeant York air defense system.  Entire generations of weapons get built, barely used, and replaced at great cost because, you can't afford to NOT upgrade if you might be at war with the USSR next year.  The cost is borne by the unrivaled American economy, and sales to other nations.  \n\nAgain, R&D is only one part of procurement.   Great amounts are spent on ordinary things like salaries, bases, medical coverage for soldiers and for veterans, etc.  Reducing the number of bases from the WWII peak to today, was a decades-long effort pitting cost savings against \"local economy\" advocates.  Reagan's 600-ship navy was as much an exercise in economic warfare against the USSR, as it was a true military expense.  The cost of OPERATIONS is huge, in both lives and money.  A peacetime force, even with lots of training, is way cheaper than the price of going to war, especially the kind of long-distance wars the USA has fought since 1917.   The political decisions are huge.  The procurement efforts for all the boring stuff is also huge.  It's just seldom highlighted.", "created_utc": "1662276088.0", "edited": "False", "id": "in10r9x", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_x54wst", "parent_id": "t3_x54wst", "score": "13", "subreddit": "AskHistorians", "subreddit_id": "t5_2ssp3"}, {"author": "platitood", "body": "Higher payment is bait.

[Drop into Streets view](https://www.google.com/maps/@39.9759561,-75.170152,3a,75y,357.48h,92.33t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sjBsMgF8luhve9uwEu9c84w!2e0!7i16384!8i8192).    You don't even need a cheap plane ticket.  \n\nIt's better than it was a few years ago, there's new construction even.  Notice the vacant lots?  These were row houses.  Every vacant lot was a house, that fell into disrepair or burned, and was bulldozed by the city.  \n\nMake your way along to 22nd and notice the houses with boarded up windows and doors.  Notice the overgrown yards.  And people right in the middle trying to keep their places nice.  Every boarded up home is a place to squat or a drug market waiting to happen.  \n\nBetween 23rd and 24th there are two intact houses, and BOTH are boarded up.  One looks like it has a nice blue door but somebody just painted the plywood to LOOK nicer, to make it less of an eyesore.  The rest are vacant lots.  \n\nAdjacent streets are often worse.  \n\nAnd it can get MUCH worse.  I figured if that area was rebounding I can always look 10 blocks away and [sure enough, it gets worse.](https://www.google.com/maps/@39.9918708,-75.1605359,3a,75y,188.63h,73.43t/data=!3m10!1e1!3m8!1sdx9A97J41lHGnxo9ZaJruQ!2e0!6shttps:%2F%2Fstreetviewpixels-pa.googleapis.com%2Fv1%2Fthumbnail%3Fpanoid%3Ddx9A97J41lHGnxo9ZaJruQ%26cb_client%3Dmaps_sv.tactile.gps%26w%3D203%26h%3D100%26yaw%3D60.744167%26pitch%3D0%26thumbfov%3D100!7i16384!8i8192!9m2!1b1!2i28)", "created_utc": "1662262889.0", "edited": "False", "id": "in0hfzw", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_x3nmcq", "parent_id": "t1_in0e27f", "score": "3", "subreddit": "Seattle", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhad"}, {"author": "platitood", "body": "Yeah, The Wire was fictional and in Baltimore, but ... those neighborhoods exist in Philly and Newark as well.", "created_utc": "1662261607.0", "edited": "False", "id": "in0f4jw", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_x3nmcq", "parent_id": "t1_imuukj6", "score": "3", "subreddit": "Seattle", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhad"}, {"author": "platitood", "body": "> but there are more concerning areas of Philly now.\n\nAh, my home town.", "created_utc": "1662261518.0", "edited": "False", "id": "in0eyjh", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_x3nmcq", "parent_id": "t1_imtq5v9", "score": "2", "subreddit": "Seattle", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhad"}, {"author": "platitood", "body": "I have PTSD from Camden.
