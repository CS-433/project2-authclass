I think she got into some trouble and came back in episode three after the moms' strike (which was against Collins Avenue, not Abby). Christi has admitted that her blow up after the hat incident had nothing really to do with the hat and that she was done being on the show and tried to get off. She pushed a cameraman as well, and I'm sure she got into trouble with Collins Avenue. *This* is why I think Christ saying \"You know how bad this sucks\" to Kelly makes sense. Also there was that whole blowup several weeks after where Kelly says to her \"Oh well maybe you should get fined.\" I think Christi wanted support from Kelly during this time probably because Kelly had just gone through it too several weeks earlier, and then that's where the whole \"you should've called me / I did call you\" argument stems from.\n\nHowever, where I get confused is when exactly things went south. If I'm not mistaken, there was a week-long or two week-long break following the competition where Chloe dropped her hat. The filming of the mall performance which supposedly took place in episode two happened during this time, and perhaps the clip of the Hylands I mentioned earlier too in order for the producers to create their storylines for the first few episodes. Christi seems to be complying and fine with the filming and in good spirits with Kelly, so this is where it still gets kind of fuzzy.

I\u2019m an American with no Iranian heritage at all, but I\u2019m absolutely fascinated with the culture, language, and people of Iran. I think not living in Iran, I can\u2019t understand the full scope of how an Iranian feels about their government or my own government (my perception is that most Iranians very much dislike their government and consider it a fascist one). Living in the United States, we\u2019re fed so much propaganda by our government about Iran, it\u2019s government and its people. Sadly, I think whereas Iranians (and probably everyone else in the world besides USA) have the ability to separate a bad government from its people, a lot of people here are not like that. They feed into the bullshit that everyone in the Middle East is an Arabic-speaking religious terrorist who hates the United States and wants to kill them and take over the world by means of radical Islam. No one takes the time to actually get to know the area... or anywhere outside of America really. \nI\u2019m interested to know about the Iranian perspective of the Nuclear Arms agreements signed during the Obama administration, which Trump later backed out of, and now Biden is trying to reinstate (from my understanding, Iran doesn\u2019t want to go back into the deal until sanctions are lifted?). I do believe as much as the government of Iran is horrible, I can imagine after seeing what US involvement has done in many neighboring countries (namely Afghanistan and Iraq) and being surrounded by US Military bases, I\u2019m not surprised that Iran wants a nuclear Arsenal for defense.... BUT please tell me the Iranian perspective on this, as since I myself am not Iranian perhaps I don\u2019t understand the full scope like I mentioned before.\nMy understanding of feminism in Iran is that the country is still very patriarchal and traditional, but like a lot of other countries is becoming more liberal over time, especially with the younger generations. From what I\u2019ve read and seen, the mandatory hijab is not worn in a similar, more conservative fashion like in Saudi Arabia. It seems to me that, in more urban areas especially, it\u2019s almost a (legally required) fashion accessory. However, I\u2019m sure depending on the area and views of one\u2019s family, this can be different for different places in Iran. Overall though I\u2019d say that Iranians are some of the most stylish people in the world!\nAgain, I\u2019m open to discussing and hearing more from Iranians about these things, as mine is just a perspective from the other side of the world through my own investigation, but I\u2019ll never understand completely since I don\u2019t live the same reality. So please enlighten me more on these things and many more!

From my experience and knowledge of other studios that my friends and family attended, a lot of the aspects of the show are specific to Dance Moms. Pretty much any student who wants to do a solo for the upcoming competition season can have a weekly scheduled time slot with a choreographer to learn and rehearse it throughout the season. The fighting on Dance Moms over the private lesson time slots always being filled up by Maddie was a bit foreign to me, but I think my dance studio never let students have more than one time slot since we only had so many choreographers and so much time throughout the week for other group dances, duets and trios. If a dancer did have two solos, they\u2019d probably just run both during one rehearsal or alternate each week. I had never heard of or seen other studios learning a new dance for each new competition. That was purely made up so the show didn\u2019t get stale. On top of that, a lot of studios do not do a new competition EVERY single weekend. They\u2019re just way too expensive (entrance fees, mileage, towing of props, etc.). My studio usually did about two competitions in March, two in April, and sometimes one in May. Then we had our recital in June, and every other year we attended a nationals (I live in North Carolina so usually our nationals were always either in Myrtle Beach or Florida).\n\nI also wanted to add that the whole competitiveness between the mothers was something a bit foreign to me as well upon beginning the show. I think mothers at my dance studio just viewed it as an extracurricular activity for their kids, and not something that would ever really turn into a career.

I agree with another user on this thread that I think Cathy began to not use her own students or choreographers from season 3 onwards because she wanted to separate the show from her actual business. I remember hearing that she practically lost all of the students she had on her season 2 competition team after the drama that took place after the nationals in Beverly Hills, as well as maybe other students enrolled at CADC at the time, so I don\u2019t blame her for that.\n\nEdit: also wanted to point out that it was somewhat admitted by Cathy during the live that Christi is not allowed to say Abby\u2019s name. I\u2019ve noticed it before, and I always figured this may have been part of her renegotiated contract to be able to leave after four seasons instead of six.
