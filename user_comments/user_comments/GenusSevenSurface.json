I\u2019m guilty of the same thing in one of my songs, so I get it. \n\n- I like that there\u2019s a narrative thread throughout the song, good job there. \n\n- The lyrics feel a little more stream of consciousness than I personally prefer, but that could simply be a matter of taste since I like lyrics that verge on being poetry. Still, it might help to take some lessons from poetry and be more concise and deliberate about word choice. There\u2019s some nice imagery in the chorus, try to write more in that vein.

Mathematics is (in my opinion) one of the most beautiful subjects out there, and there are so many ways to teach it that emphasize its beauty. For one, it's the language in which all of physics is done, so if your son enjoys understanding how the world works, all your wife would need to do is give him some examples from physics and wait for his mind to be blown. Math is also very easy to explore in the form of games and puzzles that are lots of fun. Instead of drilling him, your wife really should be focusing on the joy of mathematics and removing the pressure so that his natural curiosity and love for math can flourish.\n\nThe reason I say E/S/H instead of N/T/A is that you were straight up wrong when you said that the math he was learning has no application. Algebra can be useful for pretty much anyone out there, basic understanding of probability and statistics is vital for anyone who wants to stay informed, and while most people aren't going to be using trig or calculus in their daily lives, they are vital for pretty much any science (and economics as well). On top of all of this, learning how to think mathematically is a skill that everyone can benefit from, as it helps one learn how to construct better arguments.

I want to be able to read papers and books.\n* I liked the digest feature for annotating documents a lot. I want to be able to look at an equation or derivation, and take my own notes to fill in any blanks or add intuition that was missing.\n* You can build your own table of contents as you're writing, as well as star pages you'd like to come back to. This might be particularly useful for you if organizing your notes is important.\n* I liked that the pen nibs don't need replacement. That cuts down on both cost and mental energy.\n* I think the Supernote is a lot more sturdy and can handle falls more easily, and I'm pretty clumsy, so I'd prefer a device that can handle a bit more.\n\nI generally get the impression that the Remarkable 2 is a great choice for sketching and using as a pure notebook, and that its best feature is writing feel.
