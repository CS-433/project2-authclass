If I had to guess I would say that they probably were intended to teach to a B1 level by the time we sat our exams in school but I doubt I was much higher than an A2, I reckon most of the class would have sat at about an A1 after 6 years of study. There was a lot of sitting with textbooks and being given boring grammar explanations and conjugating verb tables. There was very little actual conversation practice - our \"Speaking\" assignments consisted of writing a script that we had to memorise and then recite from memory to the teacher.

Speaking and Pronunciation \n2. Reading and Listening (Very close 2nd)\n3. Writing \n\nI fully admit there\u2019s likely an element of bias here, I work for an English academy whose method is all about speaking. Even in classes with complete beginners we\u2019ll be getting students to listen and repeat the basic sentences and essentially guiding them through basic conversations. Our method is based on the Callan Method so there\u2019s nothing but speaking and correction but imo it\u2019s the best way to hit the ground running in a language. I\u2019ve seen students over the course of 6 months go from B1 to C1 in the language. There\u2019s even one student who gets lessons through our in-company programme and he did a lesson almost every day for a year as his business was closed due to the pandemic and he went from A1 to C1. \n\n\nOf course I guess the caveat here is this assumes you can pay for regular classes with a teacher and I know not everyone has this luxury. I would say that reading and listening have to be a very close 2nd, almost a joint 1st tbh.

I agree with what he says, with regards to understanding - speaking and production is all well and good but understanding is super super important because after all there are 2 sides to a conversation. I\u2019ve also found that since picking up some of his Story Learning books that my understanding of Spanish grammar and vocab has really increased dramatically. I think listening and reading really help as self-study methods because you can boost your understanding by learning language in context, which is key. \n\nTl;dr bit of a rambly explanation but Speaking is king for me, closely followed by Reading and Listening.", "created_utc": "1658664704.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ihfu0lj", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_w6trxz", "parent_id": "t3_w6trxz", "score": "6", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "Menathraas", "body": "There\u2019s a little controversy in my native Scotland surrounding languages that has a bit to do with the political situation here. Before I go any further, I just want to say that I\u2019m just stating the situation as I see it: ultimately I see the political situation in Scotland and the UK as a whole as a little depressing so I try to avoid talking about it where possible. \n\nEssentially the situation is this: we\u2019ve had a nationalist government in power in Scotland since 2007. Since they\u2019ve come to power they\u2019ve done a fair bit to promote Gaelic and the Scots language in the country. There\u2019s been more funding for Gaelic medium schools and at least when I was at school there started to be a move towards more Scots language stuff being taught in primary schools, although not a huge amount. Other examples of Gaelic promotion include dual language signage at train stations and on emergency vehicles in the country. In addition, the Scottish census this year featured questions on how well we could read, speak, write and understand Scots. \n\nThe nationalists and their supporters argue that the government are doing this to protect and promote cultural heritage and safeguard and promote the language for the future. It\u2019s a valid argument as both Scots and Gaelic are considered endangered languages. \n\nCritics of the nationalists essentially see it as a ploy by the government to promote more of a distinct Scottish identity, with the idea being I suppose that it would contribute to more people wanting Scottish independence in the long run as they\u2019d see themselves with a more unique Scottish identity. I\u2019ve seen some criticism of the government from people who consider the dual language signage as a waste of money, given it\u2019s present in places such as the Borders which historically never really spoke Gaelic if at all. There are also others that argue that Scots isn\u2019t actually a language, it\u2019s just a dialect and the nationalists are trying to essentially make a language happen. \n\nMy personal opinion is it\u2019s bold of the government to attempt to pursue a strategy of promoting Gaelic and Scots when we can\u2019t even agree on 1. A single European language to be taught in schools and 2. An effective way to teach it.

I'm an English teacher for the online branch of academies based in Spain, and when I look at how we teach English vs how we learnt foreign languages in school we have a couple of things wrong.\n\nWhen I was at school we didn't start learning languages until we were 10 and even then it was \"the A class does French and the B class does German\" there was very little freedom of choice, and if you chose to do the other language in primary school, then when you went to secondary school you would be moved into another class and separated from all the friends you had hung around with going through primary. I understand now that in Scotland (where I'm from) children are starting to do foreign language education earlier e.g. around 6 or 7, which is a good 1st step. I think the choice thing however is still an issue.\n\nLike I said, when I was in school it was German or French and that was it. If you wanted to do another language like Spanish or Italian then you had to do them as well as your 1st language, so for example I really wanted to study Spanish but wasn't prepared to do German and Spanish as I also wanted to do the 3 sciences at the time. The methods that we used in school were also not great - I don't fault the teachers themselves, they were trying to do the best they could with what they had - there was a lot of staring at the board rote learning conjugations and grammar rules that didn't make much sense to us along with little organic production of language, which is the best way to learn a language imo. I finished studying German at school in 2012 and at the time I studied smartphones were very much still an emerging technology, especially with language learning software - so I would like to see schools do more to proactively use apps to aid language learning as I suspect there isn't much being done in that area still.\n\nI mentioned grammar and it is true that although it can be a bit dull, at some point during the learning of a language you need to deal with grammar and where I think we're hamstrung in the UK is with the complete lack of formal teaching of English grammar, as it hasn't been a thing since 1985. When I teach my students they're all familiar with English grammatical terms and I can use them as a quick and easy way of correcting their English, they learn them very easily because when they learn Spanish they learn all the Spanish grammatical rules and terms in school so they're familiar with the concepts. Indeed, by learning more about English and English grammar for my job it has given a turbo boost to my own Spanish learning - what would have taken ages at school now takes minutes to understand because I know all the terms. I think we're really hindering our modern language education in the UK by stubbornly refusing to teach English grammar.\n\nFrom what I can gather from my students, our modern language education is where Spain's English education was 30 years ago - lots of non-native teachers teaching dry and poorly understood grammar lessons with little to no emphasis on conversation and organic production of language. I think what we need to do is: first of all pick one main language and make it the priority, modernise lessons and take some inspiration from Teaching English as a Foreign Language courses, teach English grammar in schools so students don't have to struggle as much with foreign grammar, put an emphasis on actually speaking in lessons, and encourage the use of smartphones and other technology as a supplement to classroom education.", "created_utc": "1654439866.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ib98m1g", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_v5d9i6", "parent_id": "t3_v5d9i6", "score": "5", "subreddit": "AskUK", "subreddit_id": "t5_2t4s3"}, {"author": "Menathraas", "body": "\u00a1Gracias, y gracias a ti, buena suerte!", "created_utc": "1654430958.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ib8tm6f", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_v50btz", "parent_id": "t1_ib8ia96", "score": "4", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "Menathraas", "body": "Yeah I believe the poll I got the 70% number from was only people aged between 16 to 65.

Rote learning vocab and grammar rules, endless conjugation tables, absolutely no organic language generation or encouraging us to come up with language using our own initiative. When I studied my TEFL qualification the ways I was told to teach English were completely different to the ways I learnt in school, and the things I learnt could be applied to classes of 1 or 2, all the way up to 60+ kids in a school in Vietnam. The TEFL materials even slammed the way I had learnt German as old and outdated. Fundamentally it needs to change at a basic level. The Scottish system has since changed, it started transitioning to a new curriculum as I was finishing school but by all accounts it\u2019s still just as bad. I won\u2019t condemn the teachers, they were lovely people doing the best they could with terrible, old materials and old systems.\n\nWhat I think also needs to change is the age we start learning languages. I teach online for Spanish academies and (aside from teaching almost entirely through speaking which imo is the best way to learn a language) all my students started learning English to some degree from age 4 onwards. I believe it\u2019s better now in Scotland with it starting at 6/7 but it could be further improved by beginning to teach the basics in pre-schools. \n\nOne final thing I would say is the way that we learn English also has a negative effect on our ability to learn other languages. To use my students as an example: they\u2019re all inherently familiar with grammatical terms because it\u2019s the way they learn Spanish - to the point I can quite easily use meta-linguistic terms to correct their mistakes - and it makes learning for them so much easier. Since becoming a teacher I\u2019ve learnt so much about English and English grammar, to the point that it has made learning Spanish easier for me.

I\u2019m learning Spanish too and I also teach English for the online branch of academies based in Spain so I can comment on both sides of the equation.\n\nI\u2019ve been learning Spanish for almost a year and I started with the usual Duolingo and Rosetta Stone for about a month which built up an okay basic level before I started taking lessons. My teacher was lovely and was super patient and helpful so you shouldn\u2019t stress about that - any good teacher will be there to help you and will be supportive of you and will correct your mistakes in a positive and friendly manner. \n\nAfter I had been learning Spanish for about 4 months I moved out to Madrid for 3 months and I had no choice but to speak Spanish! I realise that not everyone has the luxury of being able to move to a country that speaks their TL and enjoy full immersion, but my point is that when you actually speak to natives, you realise where the gaps in your knowledge actually are, and you can fix them more easily. Like: \u201cWait, how do I actually say I like to go swimming at the weekends\u201d for example. The bonus this has is you\u2019re not just learning the words by starting at a page or clicking on an app, you\u2019re learning them through context and that helps you to remember them more easily.\n\nI\u2019d also like to say from the point of view of a teacher - the first couple of times I had my first classes I was so nervous! I thought I was going to throw up a few times, the nerves were honestly that bad. In the end I just had to imagine I was an actor on a stage, take a deep breath and just launch into it, 7 months later and my confidence is sky high. It\u2019s had the bonus effect that I\u2019m less afraid to speak to others in my TL because it\u2019s just the same situation with the roles reversed. \n\nIn short - just go for it, speaking is so important, it truly is the best way to learn and I\u2019ll bet you\u2019ll find your level increase a lot in a short space of time. Also the bonus you have is you\u2019re learning Spanish - in my experience Spanish speakers whether they are from Spain or Latin America are some of the friendliest people on the planet, I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll be happy to help you out \ud83d\ude42", "created_utc": "1652093087.0", "edited": "False", "id": "i7wk9wk", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_ulmeht", "parent_id": "t3_ulmeht", "score": "5", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "Menathraas", "body": "Yep, as both a native speaker and an English teacher the definition you have is correct. \n\u201cStrike when the iron is hot\u201d - Take advantage of an opportunity when it presents itself.", "created_utc": "1651961649.0", "edited": "1651961861.0", "id": "i7q8ea6", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_uklp4d", "parent_id": "t1_i7q46zt", "score": "14", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "Menathraas", "body": "The battletomes are so much nicer in 3rd.

Everything has been simplified from what it once was from warscrolls to core rules to faction and subfaction abilities.\n\nAoS used to rely a lot on d3 and d6 tables for relics and traits and stuff because it was a \u201croll or choose\u201d system but they realised folk almost never rolled so they were just struggling to arbitrarily come up with all these relics and traits to the point that you had loads that just did the same thing. Now that\u2019s all gone and it\u2019s much more straightforward.\n\nDitto for army rules, used to be every sub faction had a relic and a command ability they had to take and they scrapped that. Subfaction rules are just 1 rule now and it\u2019s super simple.\n\nMy friends and I were chatting about this last week - Space Marines have about 8 different army rules for just a basic Tactical Marine. Stormcast on the other hand have 2 or 3 depending on army you pick with an extra subfaction trait. So already you can see they have half as many rules and there\u2019s just less OP stuff going on like there is in 40k.\n\nI played Marines before I quit 40k and that army was a big part of why I quit - it was a case of \u201cMy army does X and then Y and because it\u2019s turn 2 I get to do Z and then I can spend a CP to activate A which combos with B\u201d and so on. In AoS there\u2019s just less of that and it makes for a much more enjoyable experience because you\u2019re not just dunking on your opponent by accident when you play a casual game because you play an army that happens to be strong. It\u2019s also easier to remember all the rules as well! \n\nSo definitely get involved with AoS, it\u2019s such a fun system with far fewer flaws imo than 40k.", "created_utc": "1643283978.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hufeigh", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_sdtlwj", "parent_id": "t3_sdtlwj", "score": "13", "subreddit": "ageofsigmar", "subreddit_id": "t5_38pa9"}, {"author": "Menathraas", "body": "I\u2019m from Scotland, absolutely 0 connection to the US or the Patriots.

Disappointing but let\u2019s be honest probably a needed nerf.\n- Ezekiel\u2019s +1 attack buff is now only for Characters and Core but doesn\u2019t stack with Shock Assault.\n- Sammael lost a point of Toughness going from 6 to 5\n\nThe Good (oh boy oh boy there's a lot)\n\n- Inner Circle infantry (DW, Libs, ICs and named characters) can only be wounded on a 4+\n- DW Knights hit on 2s\n- Jink is BUFFED. 5++ if Ravenwing models move and 4++ if they advance!\n- Deathwing Command Squads are now a thing (my 2 spare models from my old 7th Ed Command Squad now have a place)\n- Land Speeder Vengeance got buffed from Heavy d6 to Heavy 2d3 and it's overcharge negative changed from 3 Mortal Wounds and never shoot again to just 1MW per 1 rolled (thank fuck finally)\n- Rift Cannon is now Heavy D3 (same) S12 AP* D* (new) because it does 3 MW per successful wound roll\n- The Nephilim FINALLY HAS A BONUS TO HIT OTHER AIRCRAFT\n- Avenger Mega Bolter is now S5 D2 versus S6 D1 before\n- Ravenwing and Deathwing Champions can now fight first in the Fight Phase if they start in combat with any enemy characters\n- The Deathwing Champion used to make D3 extra attacks against a unit with 5 or more models but now makes 3 extra attacks if he targets a unit with 10 or more models (this could be in the middle but the Champion has also gained an extra attack base so I guess it\u2019s more of a win).\n- Interrogator Chaplains gained an extra attack going from 3 to 4\n- Asmodai gained another attack going from 3 to 4 base and the damage on his Blades of Reason went from d6 to 2d3. He can however only make 1 additional attack with this weapon after making all his other attacks with his Crozius. On the whole some welcome buffs for what was arguably our worst named character\n- Ravenwing Talonmasters have become BS2+ as standard (wow) and gained an extra 2 wounds whilst losing an attack\n- Sammael\u2019s Plasma Cannon now has one fire mode at S8 AP-4 D2 and doesn\u2019t overheat! He also gained +1\u201d movement and 2 wounds! That\u2019s HUGE\n- Sammael also lost the 2d6\u201d advance in exchange for the standard 6\u201d auto advance. I prefer the consistency having been on the wrong end of a 2\u201d advance a few times\n- Azrael\u2019s plasma gun is now one profile at S8 AP-4 D2 with no overcharge risk. His sword has also been changed from S+2 AP-3 D D3 to S+2 AP-4 D2. The Mortal Wound in addition has been changed from on a 6+ to wound to an unmodified 6. \n- Azrael now gives 2CPs if he\u2019s your warlord as opposed to 1 previously!\n- Belial now has a Master Crafted Storm Bolter as opposed to a regular one\n- Deathwing Apothecaries finally have 3 attacks base\n- Nephilims and Dark Talons gained an extra wound :\u2019)\n- Corvus Hammers buffed to S+1 AP-1 D2 but now cost 5ppm. Seems like a fair trade.\n- Combining the new Chapter Command rules with our unique characters is totally doable. Say hello to your Deathwing Chapter Champion or your Ravenwing Chief Apothecary, and feel free to run an Interrogator Chaplain as a Master of Sanctity. Plus given Asmodai is the Master of Repentance you can run them alongside one another in a list. Recreate those Legacy of Caliban vibes :)\n\nThe Middle\n\n- All of our named characters have to take the same Warlord Trait (the one in the codex). Putting this in the middle because it sucks for flexibility/fluff reasons but it\u2019s not so bad because we have arguably the best Warlord Trait in the new codex. For reference for those that don\u2019t know it\u2019s: pick a unit within 6\u201d of the Warlord, the previous doctrine applies to it. So 3 turns of Devastator potentially.\n- The Ravenwing banner is now the generic Astartes \u201cfight again\u201d rule as opposed to +1 attack. Good for Black Knights but bad for a loss of flavour.\n- Asmodai\u2019s Exemplar of Hate rule changed from reroll all failed hits in melee and +1 attack for all units within 6\u201d to gain +1 to chant the Litany of Hate and +3\u201d to its range. Probably more of a nerf and I would have liked to have seen him gain the ability to chant 2 litanies but it\u2019s something I suppose\n- Ravenwing Champions gained an extra attack but lost the Blade of Caliban (S+3 AP-3 D D3) for a Master Crafted Power Sword. Hmm.\n\n\nI've probably missed loads but boys this feels amazing. What a time to be one of the Unforgiven!\n\nEDIT: I\u2019ve been going through it and just adding to the list as I find new things.

Sometimes I find it's better to put the bigger guns into Necron heavy infantry and use basic weapons to just strip wounds off of their vehicles.

I use bone for Greenwing, green for Deathwing and either white if it's raven styled iconography (like on Black Knights) or just bone for standard aquilas on Ravenwing models. Just try out a few things if you want and see what looks coolest to you.\n\n3. From my understanding every 10th Company maintains a full 10 squads of Vanguard Marines in addition to Scouts now in the 10th Company but the Marines also slot into the other Companies based on their role so you wouldn't be wrong to do a Company of Vanguard whether that's 10th or otherwise.\n\n4. I don't think I can add anything to what's already been given. If you have Legacy of Caliban and Knights of Caliban you have the vast majority of 40k DA literature. There is a reading guide on Gav Thorpe's website which takes you through the correct order but generally do Knights before Legacy because the Legacy trilogy doesn't really make sense without reading Angels of Darkness first plus if you read Legacy without reading Angels then you'll spoil Angels for yourself.\n\n5. Yes, to put it bluntly the models are fucking awesome. Given that the Storm Speeder is getting the Ravenwing keyword I imagine it'll be the same for the Outriders and the ATV. It's difficult to estimate the numbers not knowing the points costs but hey the codex is coming soon so not long to wait! Also keep in mind we're getting the Primaris Chaplain on Bike too, so the option is there for a full bike/speeder Primaris force although I doubt the Chaplain will get the Ravenwing keyword because they haven't had it in the past but I guess we'll just have to wait and see. \n\nGood luck with your hobbying! :)", "created_utc": "1600288879.0", "edited": "False", "id": "g5id5nf", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_iu2j5b", "parent_id": "t3_iu2j5b", "score": "2", "subreddit": "theunforgiven", "subreddit_id": "t5_3pn75"}, {"author": "Menathraas", "body": "Compilation of the changes that we've seen from the new in-box rules (fair warning these are just intended as a quick reference for absolute beginners so they may not be 100% accurate and these instructions have known misprints to boot), that being said:\n\nHellblaster Assault Plasma is now Assault 3 up from Assault 2\n\nHellblaster Heavy Plasma is now Damage 2 non-overcharged suggesting that it will be Damage 3 when overcharged\n\nIn the same vein Macro-Plasma Incinerators are now D2 base\n\nThe Twin Plasma Cannon is shown as having D2 base and D3 overcharged (this is the only quick reference rules sheet to feature an overcharged profile however).\n\n\nIn summary: along with the \"only blowing up on an unmodified 1\" thing it seems that Assault Hellblasters have gained an extra shot and all heavy plasma weapons are now D2 base going to D3 when overcharged.

It's an extreme example but it has me concerned for my Knights.\n\n\nEdit: [link](https://i.4cdn.org/tg/1591928045204.png) for reference", "created_utc": "1591986644.0", "edited": "1591987021.0", "id": "fumiegz", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_h7bmv4", "parent_id": "t1_ftrolll", "score": "1", "subreddit": "40kImperialKnights", "subreddit_id": "t5_k2e5g"}, {"author": "Menathraas", "body": "No problem :) I'm sure you'll have an easy time selling the Marines, there's already so much hype around them.", "created_utc": "1590585107.0", "edited": "False", "id": "frz4ec9", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_gr3abi", "parent_id": "t1_frxanos", "score": "1", "subreddit": "Warhammer40k", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rr81"}, {"author": "Menathraas", "body": "I suppose that's the beauty of Warhammer.

TBH I'm glad I did because they are pretty good.\n\n>How do they generally play?\n\nThey can be played in a few different ways actually because of how the chapter functions. There are 10 companies in a Space Marine Chapter and in the case of the Dark Angels: the 1st Company (the Deathwing) are these guys in big, heavy Terminator armour, the 2nd Company (the Ravenwing) are all motorbikes and land speeders and the 3rd-10th Companies (known unofficially as Greenwing because of the armour colour) are your traditional Space Marines in power armour. I've got armies made of all 3 and I'll give you a quick run down.\n\nDeathwing: More of an army you'd run if you want one that looks cool rather than being super effective although you can do some nasty stuff with them. They do something called \"deep-striking\" mainly which allows them to teleport onto the battlefield and get right in the faces of your enemies. In addition to regular terminators, Dark Angels get guys called Deathwing Knights who have these big maces and shields and are quite powerful. Pair Deathwing up with Ravenwing for some nice synergy bonuses and you have a mobile, hard to kill army that will get right in your opponent's face.\n\nRavenwing: The best bike army in the game, simple as that. They have a whole host of special exclusive bikes and land speeders that can do some really powerful stuff. With the Ravenwing you have the potential for lists that can win tournaments. Fast, hard hitting and like I said before the best bike army in the game.\n\nGreenwing: Last but by no means least. These are the guys I bring to my regular games, I play them as a mixed bag with some squads sitting on objectives in the backfield and others running about in armoured transports. They benefit the most from the Dark Angels \"Chapter Tactics because all the Dark Angels get bonuses to their Overwatch which is basically shooting at the enemy when they charge you, however the Greenwing have a special formation called a Demi Company that means that they can fire Overwatch even better than other Dark Angels. \n\n>What makes them the best?\n\nThe versatility, the fact I have 3 different armies in the one Chapter. Dark Angels lend themselves best to a really fast, hard hitting style of gameplay that works incredibly well. Also they get access to a bunch of exclusive units that other Chapters don't.\n\nI also love the lore behind them but I'd encourage you to read about that yourself because I could write another full post just on that subject.\n\nMy one most important piece of advice I can give in relation to starting Warhammer is: pick the faction that you think looks and sounds the coolest to you - whether that's the guys with the coolest backstory or the best on the tabletop - that's the most important thing.", "created_utc": "1480870763.0", "edited": "False", "id": "daryt04", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_5gfpij", "parent_id": "t1_darxg8m", "score": "2", "subreddit": "Warhammer40k", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rr81"}, {"author": "Menathraas", "body": "> What generally makes each chapter of Space Marines different.\n\nIt's a lot to do with what original chapter they are descended from and this is reflected in the tabletop in something called their \"Chapter Tactics\" which you can check out on 1d4chan, if you google \"1d4chan space marine tactics\".
