In yours, harsh sunlight is hitting the rocks, blowing your highlights. The waterfall on the other hand, is in shadow. Generally, you want your subject to draw the eye with light or color. In his, the light is soft and even, with the waterfall's pearly white drawing in the eye. Consider coming earlier or later to take waterfall shots, as harsh mid-day light can lead to really abrupt contrast, instead of the smooth dreamy look that suits long exposures so well.\n\nSecond, check out the foreground and background of the waterfall.

For example, I bet they have $1000 sitting in an account somewhere to buy this lady new desks, but they can't use it, because it's earmarked for textbooks or some shit. At the first school where I worked, I wanted $150 to pay for a subscription to an online service I could use with my students. I applied for it and I was denied. However, the district spent tens of thousands the following year to buy dozens of big screen TVs that doubled as blackboards. Oh, and we already *had* smartboards in every classroom. They just had federal funding earmarked for tech spending, so they decided \"hey let's buy a bunch of big screen TVs because it's use it or lose it.\" I run into this issue every single year, and it is infuriating.\n\n* On that same note, there seems to *always* be money for new stadiums and sports facilities.

If you suggested \"lets cut all funding for sports, and focus on ensuring our academics and classrooms are funded first\" you would be crucified. I'm not suggesting anything that extreme, mind you.

Sunrise and sunset are your friends. Early mornings have dewy leaves and sunbeams that are gone by an hour past sunrise. Sunstars peeking through the trees can make compelling subjects.\n\nAlso consider having all of the following for a real banger: foreground interest, background interest, a subject, leading lines, and incredible light.\n\nHere's an example that has [all of those](https://flic.kr/p/29rH2ms). Notice how no space is wasted. the foreground has cool rocks. the background has trees. the stairs lead to the sun. the way the light hits the steps is nice.\n\n[Here's another](https://flic.kr/p/GhBUA4).

I'd prefer a natural look over this.\n\n* the shadows are inconsistent. On the bottom right, they are quite dark, maybe even a little too dark. On the top left, the underside of the rock cliffs has shadows that have been recovered so much that they are almost the same luminosity level as the sky. Rocks in shadow can't be as bright as a cloud in daytime, that registers to the brain as unnatural. I'd bring up the shadows a bit on the right, burn them on the left, and then add a vignette to both sides.\n\n* you did a very good job recovering the sky- maybe too good. again, it's weird that the sky is the same luminosity level as the stone. giving it a nice glow can make increasing the exposure look natural rather than overexposed.\n\n* last but not least, if you find yourself here again, a neutral density filter and a circular polarizer could help you get the water the way you want, while also possibly blurring out the people. It always sucks when other photographers are in your shot :)\n\n\nedit: I see you used a phone so some of these tips aren't applicable. it's really impressive this came from a phone, as plenty of people with DSLRs have done worse!", "created_utc": "1636827223.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hkhe8zs", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_qt3d8a", "parent_id": "t3_qt3d8a", "score": "9", "subreddit": "photographs", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qkod"}, {"author": "DatAperture", "body": "It is so damn cool that smartphones can do astro now.

There's a decent chance that right now, there is an open position available to teach Spanish in a place you wouldn't mind living.\n\n* ESL jobs though? Growing on trees. Overflowing. Can't fill them as fast as we post them. If you're willing to pivot to that, your opportunities will increase 100x\n\n* In fact, there are a lot of positions where you'd do both- maybe you'd teach 3 Spanish classes and have 2 ESL classes. Any candidate that has ESL + Spanish cert is moved to the top of the pile.\n\n* Our pay is about the best you can hope for in teaching. Bougie upstate NY suburban districts start you at around 50k with great health insurance and obviously 10x more time off than people working a desk job (hello summer vacation). More rural districts might start at 40k, long island districts can start around 75k (but with cost of living to match). By the time you retire you're pushing 6 figures. \n\n* Cost of living is...ok. I could not afford a house on just my salary, but if you're in a couple with someone earning comparably to you, you can swing a house no problem. I'm in a DINK situation and live well.\n\nOk, the bad:\n\n* New York requires a master's degree to teach public school. I don't necessarily disagree with my state's decision to mandate that, but I do disagree with them asking us to pay for an entire master's degree with no corresponding increase in salary to help pay it off.\n\n* You're gonna have to pass a fuckload of certification tests, at your own expense. They're like $100+ a pop\n\n* Here's it's 4 years to tenure. That's fucking long\n\n* You're gonna have to be tech savvy. Covid has made it so that anyone who isn't tech savvy has either retired or wants to retire. Your first year will be overwhelming because you'll be navigating a dozen types of instructional technology, covid, and also just like, *being a first year teacher*\n\nFinally, things people think are bad, but are good:\n\n* The kids are NOT the problem. My kids are AMAZING. I love them. They're funny and smart and their memes are spicy. If you try to make your class fun, and you respect them and get to know them, they will show you more appreciation than you'd ever expect. Every year, my one or two duds are outweighed by 120+ rockstars.\n\n* A lot of teachers just want to go straight to high school. I think the reasoning behind that is that they wanna teach the hard stuff to the smart kids. There's like this idea in our heads about teaching an AP class full of super motivated kids. That's great and all, but sort of a fantasy- at best you'll get 1 section of AP, and then get stuck with 4 sections of gen-ed with kids who just wanna pass the final and leave. My hot take is that middle school is WAY more fun, because you get them fresh, with no preconceptions. No other teachers below you who did a shitty job and you have to fill in the gaps in their teaching. You get to set the stage for them. They aren't \"too cool for school\" yet, and they're willing to put themselves out there, they still have some of that enthusiastic little kid energy. Plus, since the age gap is even wider with younger kids, you get a little more respect as an adult right off the bat. I have taught all grades from 7-12, and you'd have to pry my current 7th grade position from my cold dead hands.
