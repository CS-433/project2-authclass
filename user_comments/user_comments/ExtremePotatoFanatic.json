If you read the details, sometimes it\u2019ll say it\u2019ll cover up to so many dollars after the primary insurance. \n\nAgain, I don\u2019t know exactly what the card says or what they told you but I would bet the over coverage code isn\u2019t going to work.  \n\nI don\u2019t work mail order but worst case scenario, have your doctor send the script to retail and see if it goes through.\n\nAlso, some hormones are controlled substances such as testosterone or esterified estrogens. Some states (like my home state of MI) do not allow a transfer of a controlled substance unless the prescription has been filled once before a transfer. As in, your dr sends it in with a refill. You fill it for the first time at the first pharmacy and then transfer the refill. It\u2019s confusing but it\u2019s illegal to transfer otherwise.
