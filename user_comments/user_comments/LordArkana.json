My partner also has a lot of dysphoria, and whenever they talk to me about the specifics of it, it's always about things I love about them, so it's hard to say the right thing and keep a straight face. \nAs for the back pain, I found a kind of therapy that could work, but it's only in the private sector so I can't afford it.

It's been great, but they since came out as a trans woman; I'm exclusively attracted to men and non-binary people, not women, unfortunately. They used to be non-binary and already discarded the idea of being a woman at the time we started dating, but this changed a few months ago, and I feel hurt and betrayed. I know it's not about me, but I don't want to lose the love of my life because of their gender; I just can't see myself with a woman, it doesn't feel right. They're going to change everything I love about them and I can't stand it. They were perfect to me and now, so many things are different and I don't like the changes... but I can't tell them that, I don't know what to do.

It's been really bad for the past 4-5 days. I tried many types of painkillers, none of them work. I wish I had the ability to go back to work and stop feeling like a useless lump, but it hurts so much and no treatment seems possible. I'm worried my job will stop paying me because it's been too long and there's no obvious diagnostic.   \n\n\nThat on top of everything else, and I've been having passive s\\*\\*dal thoughts since yesterday.

You say your times in a bathhouse were bad because of your appearance, did anyone explicitly tell you that or made you feel that way, or you believe that's why it didn't go well? There are so many people out there, into all the different kinds of bodies, and I know it's difficult to accept ourselves when we don't fit the norm, because I'm the same way.

We were both in relationships at the time, but 3 years ago they ended things and so did I, and we started dating. Before we did, they came out as non-binary. Now I'd been exclusively attracted to men, but after many conversations I realized it didnt matter that my partner was not a man and I adapted. Everything worked out.\nThen my partner started medical transition with estrogen, and I had to adjust but I was still fine. They also told me a few times about thinking they were a trans woman a few years ago, but dismissed that idea. I unlearned many things and also learned more about my own attractions.\nSometimes in 2021, my partner made the reveal that their gender was probably female after all, that they were a woman, and would probably change their pronouns as well. I... haven't been taking it well. \nIn our case, there was no repressing or lying, I was aware from day 1, but I really, really did not expect my partner to be a woman after all the years they had to reflect on it, all the comments they made about it... it feels like a betrayal to me. They could have been any gender, I would have been fine with it, just not woman. It feels like a cruel joke. I wish I was just pansexual and could deal with it.
