But now going back to your argument about Central Europe. I'm Ukrainian but from Zakarpattia which is the small area in West of the country. That area has been under Austria-Hungary rule and then under Czechoslovakian rule, until Soviets took it for themselves in 1945. My region has A LOT more in common with neighboring Slovakia or Hungary than it does with say Eastern Ukraine. The biggest city in my region, Uzhhorod, definitely feels very European similar to Prague or Bratislava. Believe it or not both Florence and Siena in Italy reminded me the most of it.
