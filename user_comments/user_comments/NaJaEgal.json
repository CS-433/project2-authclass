Is it really a thing, or just a buzzword for either 1) \"I leveled up and need to change the methods I'm using\" or 2) \"Learning a language takes more time than I expected, and I just realised that\"?\n\nIt's an honest question, because when I first joined this sub and read about \"intermediate plateau\", I thought to myself: \"hm, interesting concept, let's see how it works out with the first language I learn independently all the way through\". I braced myself for this boring neverending slog of\n\n>the dreaded Intermediate Plateau\n\nbut'm still waiting for it to happen, working my way up to C1.\n\nEdit:\n\nOkay, after reading all the answers (and other comments in this thread) I came to a conclusion that:\n\n1. \"Intermediate plateau\" means roughly: \"I felt a lot of progress with my beginner resources, but I don't know what to do next\". If you have experience studying something independently (not necessarily a language), you *do* know what to do next and you'll likely not run out of interesting and challenging things to do. It might take \"a long fucking time\", but never feels like a \"plateau\". So it's more of a learning methodology thing, than objective unavoidable endless mire of dread every learner is bound to trudge through at an intermediate level (sorry, that's the impression I got from this sub a few years ago, and I was waiting for it to happen with horror).\n2. People talk specifically about \"*intermediate* plateau\", because similar beginner problems usually sound like \"I don't know where to start\" instead. And relatively few people who get to advanced levels have probably made peace with the fact that learning  a language takes a lot of time and figured out what works for them by that time. Hence no \"*advanced plateau*\", although it takes even longer and the progress is even less perceptible.\n3. Textbooks (in this context intermediate and advanced textbooks) are severely underrated. Textbooks team, go!\n\nThanks everyone, your answers have clarified the matter to me, more or less.\n\nEdit 2:\n\nIt just occurred to me that it might be a matter of framing as well: if you concentrate on the things you *can do*, then going from understanding 99% to understanding 99.5% of any given text might feel like a negligible improvement and be demotivating. It doesn't *feel* that much different subjectively.\n\nIf you concentrate on your *goal* instead, and on the things that you still *can't do*, you just keep going like, for example: \"I want to be able to read YA books, understanding 99.9% of it. Can I do that? No? Working towards that goal.\" You just keep expanding your vocabulary until it's 1 lookup/5 pages, and it takes as long as it takes. If you learn 5 (10, 20, 30...) words a day every day you'll inevitably be there eventually.\n\nSo, I guess, first time learners lack that trust in the process of learning.

I look up some of the words in a dictionary if I stumble upon them and they prevent my comprehension. The general advice is to read a couple of books (or a series) of the same author in a row, so that the words are being repeated naturally.\n\n>For intensive reading, how do you enjoy it?\n\nSometimes I don't. Seriously, though, in pre-internet era, as I learned English, I just had to make do with what I had. The very first book I read in English was \"Alices Adventures in Wonderland & Through the Looking Glass\" (first extensively, then intensively), and I enjoyed every second of it. The second one was \"A Man of the Property\", a book that a friend of a friend of my mom borrowed from a library, and it was the most tedious and boring experience ever, barring \"Bleak House\", perhaps. But I didn't have much of a choice if I wanted to learn English, so I powered through it.\n\nNow that I can allow myself to be picky and spoiled, I choose books that I'm eager to read, but are too difficult to read them extensively yet, for my intensive reading. If a book turns out to be shit, I drop it and pick something else.\n\n>How do you maintain concentration looking so much up in a dictionary or making annotations?\n\nIt's easier for me to maintain concentration while reading intensively, tbh, because I just *have* to concentrate in order to make sense of the text in front of me. And I usually read until I have written down my daily norm \u2014 around 20-25 new words \u2014 then I just stop and call it a day. I know that extensive reading covers my back in terms of the amount of books read.\n\nAfter more than ten thousand pages of German books read (\u2248500-600 of them intensively), my current reading comprehension level is as follows: I'm reading a book by Wolfgang Hohlbein (German equivalent of Stephen King) comfortably, it doesn't feel like work at all, and if I choose to write down unknown words, it's about 0,3-0,5 words/page.", "created_utc": "1656667611.0", "edited": "False", "id": "iefjzit", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_voqd2z", "parent_id": "t3_voqd2z", "score": "15", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "NaJaEgal", "body": "I did 20-25 new words/day.

Someone with a problem similar to mine. I even considered writing a post on r/books some time ago, but after reading a few posts there I realized that I'd be downvoted to hell if I did.\n\nYes, I was an avid reader as a kid (and quite omnivorous one at that), and yes, as soon as I grew up the passion has vanished. And no, it has nothing to do with my attention span, as I'm perfectly capable of spending 8+ hours in a row with a textbook. It's just that fiction has become incredibly boring to me and I feel like I've read that all a thousand times before. In my case it does also include most of the movies and series, though.\n\nAt first, it was at least *somewhat* interesting to read books in English, because my brain was busy decoding the language. As soon as it started to become effortless, i.e. when I just started scraping C1, it became as boring as reading books in Russian. Because I mostly don't care about the plot, don't care about the characters, the author is either a moron or a fool and doesn't know what he's writing about, and the book is full of clich\u00e9s. Yeah, I know how it sounds, I just needed to finally vent.\n\nI don't have a ready solution for you, as I'm still struggling with it myself. But some things that did work for me were:\n\n1. Reading non-fiction. \"The Structure of Scientific Revolutions\" by Thomas Kuhn, \"A Way With Words\" by Michael Drout, \"Life on the Mississippi\" by Mark Twain or \"Porcelain: A Memoir\" by Moby were among the books that I virtually swallowed. Pros: The authors usually know what they're talking about. Cons: 1. It's a hit or miss, I could only endure 3 pages of Benjamin Franklin's autobiography, for example \u2014 such a pompous prick. 2. Some books are genuinely hard. If you need to eventually have read tens of thousands of pages in your TL, reading five pages of \"Theoretical English Grammar\" and taking a few days to ponder about them is of little help towards *that* goal.\n2. Listening to audiobooks while playing games like \"three in a row\", going for a walk or riding a bus. Pros: 1. If the narrator is invested in the story, their intonations can help liven up the experience for you. 2. You train your listening comprehension at the same time. Cons: 1. It still does't help if you can't stand the author (might work for things that are just bland and boring, though). 2. You don't train your \"reading muscle\", i.e. the ability to turn written symbols into a movie in your head.\n3. Reading books that are above your level. Pros: The plot might be just as bland and full of clich\u00e9s if you strip it down, but at least your brain has all that shiny new vocabulary and tricky grammar to play with. Cons: 1. It's slower and you get overloaded with information pretty quickly.\n\nAs other people have suggested, being able to drop a book you don't enjoy at any stage of reading increases your chances of finding a book you'd enjoy. In hindsight, there might have been a better use of my time and effort than powering though a couple of really emotionally draining books.\n\nPorn, that was also mentioned here, has its place, but it should be treated with caution.

For all of these answers you'd want to know the native language-target language pair to be able to meaningfully interpret your results.\n\nAlso: no experience in self studying anything prior to language learning, not knowing where to start, not knowing how to deal with an \"intermediate plateau\", not knowing how to improve your language once you've reached an advanced level, myths surrounding language learning (aka: \"I'm 21, am I too old to learn a new language?\" seriously, I'm not exaggerating here, such posts exist), dyslexia, burn out, ADHD, bad sight/hearing, other health conditions.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>How important is being able to speak conversationally with no accent (as in sounds fluent)?\n\nSo, did you mean\n\n1)conversationally\n\n2) with no accent\n\nor 3) sounds fluent?\n\nBecause those three are different things.\n\nBTW, there's no such thing as \"no accent\" it's \"native accent\" at best.
