And brawl isn't even particularly good because speed boost is very predictable and spam comps are way stronger. Spam Comps with Baptiste Zen can melt the brawl comps very quickly on most maps, outside of a few inside areas on control maps for example Lijang Control Centre.\n\nLucio's ult is basically terrible, temporary shields that fade pretty fast and are useful only really against Nanoblade (and even that is very unlikely to stop a Genji), Shatter (have to been wallriding or on a high ground close enough to drop beat to save your team), Sigma Ult (spam comps can still burst through the temporary shields so it's unlikely to save anyone) and I am probably forgetting something else but still the top comp right now is probably still spam. Even nerfed Brigitte is still better than Lucio in any comp except Brawl.\n\nLucio is a character who is tied around his ability to give speed to Rein + other characters with no mobility/low mobility. His damage is not enough when characters can have armor/shields or be healed up in two seconds by any of the other healers (except Mercy I guess because she's also pretty bad). His damage is also inconsistant and aiming with him is more difficult than with Baptiste or Brig (W + M1 YEP) or Zen.  \n\nHe can be quick and hard to kill *IF* the enemy isn't running Sigma, Orisa, Brig, Baptiste, Zen, McCree, Echo, Tracer... \n\nA lot of characters either have CC to disrupt his movement or have high damage and can still keep up with him (it's possible with Echo/Tracer)\n\nIn comp sure, Lucio is less of a throw pick nowadays but it's just risky compared to running any of the other healers.\n\n(small edit: This is entirely my opinion that's based of my experiences within comp and 4.4k scrims)", "created_utc": "1593786242.0", "edited": "1593789930.0", "id": "fwt2np1", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_hkjk98", "parent_id": "t3_hkjk98", "score": "16", "subreddit": "Competitiveoverwatch", "subreddit_id": "t5_34fcy"}, {"author": "JustAFangirl", "body": "I haven't loved a Twice comeback in a while but god I love this so much.
