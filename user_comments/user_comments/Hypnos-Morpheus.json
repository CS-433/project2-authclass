Y aqu\u00ed mucha gente hablar\u00e1 de la MSN, pero la realidad es que con LE el Bar\u00e7a jugaba muy bien. Se podr\u00eda argumentar que no gan\u00f3 nada en Munich que no se hubiera ganado con \u00e9l, pero el equipo, como m\u00ednimo, mantuvo lo esperado y tuvo temporadas buenas, llegando lejos en Europa y ganando ligas comodamente.\n\nY a ver, para m\u00ed lo del City, igual que Chelsea, PSG y compa\u00f1\u00eda, es para que les prohiban jugar en Europa durante 10 a\u00f1os. Es vergonzoso lo del Fair-Play. Habiendo dicho esto, el City ha gastado algo m\u00e1s que los otros, pero los resultados son los que son. Pep lleg\u00f3 en la 16/17, y desde entonces ha ganado mucho m\u00e1s que todo el resto juntos. El Chelsea s\u00ed les gano una Champions, pero llevan desde la misma 16/17 sin ganarla. El \u00fanico equipo que les hace un m\u00ednimo de competencia es el Liverpool de Klopp. El t\u00edo ha tenido los mejores fichajes, y los ha aprovechado. De mientras el United con CR7, Sancho, Rashford y compa\u00f1\u00eda se llevan palizas, y el PSG a veces ni gana la Ligue 1.", "created_utc": "1660572808.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ikdv6z1", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_wo5yqu", "parent_id": "t1_ikd0v1n", "score": "1", "subreddit": "askspain", "subreddit_id": "t5_3ofkf"}, {"author": "Hypnos-Morpheus", "body": "Read about that a few days ago, it's crazy how bad it's gotten.
