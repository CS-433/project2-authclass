Different strokes for different folks?). \"Take that\" which completely destroys everything you've been doing and completely eliminates your chance of winning feels to me like take that implemented poorly. It leaves a bad taste, no one enjoys it happening to them. Whereas when take that is well implemented in a game, such as in one of my favourite games, Oceans, it feels thematic, it's not too difficult to recover from, and it doesn't eliminate your chances of winning. In Oceans it also always feels like something you had the opportunity to to defend against (by playing defensive traits) but didn't, and therefore you don't feel targeted, it's just that you left yourself open to being attacked and your opponents killer whale has to feed somewhere...\n\nMy point is that take that mechanics get a lot of hate, but I think that they can actually be integrated into a game really well.

I was running the youth department and we were 1 week away from starting our program back up again after the school holidays. I had worked my butt off planning for the term and just told me it was over and I had the option to continue serving (as part of the team) in the department I used to run or I could leave that department and focus on other things. I chose to take the latter option and stop volunteering in the youth department after I had helped transition in the next leaders, which was something I was committed to doing despite it not being required of me. I sent the email saying I was going to stop volunteering in Youth at the end of the school term and all hell broke loose. \n\nSuddenly the senior pastor, who lives on the other side of the country, wanted to meet with me. Before even hearing my reasoning for not wanting to keep volunteering in the youth department (keep in mind, I was still a key volunteer in other areas of the church) I was told that my decision was \"not of God\" and that **I** wasn't considering how much my leaving would damage the youth ministry I helped build. Additionally, I should consider that this was a reversal sent by God and if I kept submissive to my leaders God would work out opportunities for me in the future. \n\nI was super upset by all this, and confided in someone that my boyfriend and I were considering moving churches because he didn't think the way it all went down was acceptable. This rumor spread all the way back to the people who started this particular church, who then rung up my parents and told them that they should order me to break up with my boyfriend, as he was clearly a bad influence on me. \n\nSome friends within the church were angry with how I was treated, and said so. This turned into 2 months of meetings with pastors to argue about whether or not I deserved an apology. Most meetings ended with me bawling my eyes out in front of them, and being told that while they maybe \"could have handled things better\", this decision was from God, and they knew this for certain because they thought and prayed about it for 2 weeks. Of the 7 leaders involved, I got 1 genuine apology, 2 half assed apologies, and 4 refusals to apologise. \n\nAnyways, there are so many more details but this comment is getting ridiculously long. In the end, I moved churches and am now surrounded by leaders I trust, I got engaged to the man I was told to break up with, educated myself on spiritual abuse, and watched as that old youth ministry fell from 90 kids in attendance (when I was running it), to 15 kids (after I left).
