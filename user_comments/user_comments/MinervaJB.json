Do the ones that sound funny and interesting to you and don't bother with anything that looks like a fetch quest.\n\nSome romances are racegated. So, depending on who you're planning to romance playing a dwarf may be unwise. The game is kind of \"biased\" towards elves for *reasons* but I wouldn't say you'll miss anything terribly significant playing as a dwarf either.\n\nThe DLC are best played either after the main campaign or just before the ending. Trespasser forces you to play it last (it's the game's epilogue after all) but the other two ask for a high-level inquisitor (I think 21 and 23) so you have to play them pretty late anyway.\n\nI always recommend playing an elf (and doing the elf-gated romance) if you're playing only once so you get the most out of it, but if you're doing more than one playthrough you can do that later. If you haven't read spoilers the plot twist will surprise you the same regardless of what race you're playing.", "created_utc": "1623887357.0", "edited": "1623887569.0", "id": "h212jux", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_o1dt4j", "parent_id": "t3_o1dt4j", "score": "3", "subreddit": "dragonage", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r8lo"}, {"author": "MinervaJB", "body": "Depends on the place.

First month, he visited several EU countries, got a 600 euros bill, called customer service, and said he had not known that roaming was so expensive, no one had told him when he told us he was travelling overseas. The company had a policy that the first time a customer complained about something, we could refund them, particularly if the complaint was that the customer had not been informed about extra charges. So the rep informed him about roaming costs and refunded him all of the roaming charges, leaving the bill at 30 euros (the bill was already too cheap for what he had because he had every discount that could be applied to his plan).\n\nSecond month comes around, he kept using the phone overseas, got a 1500 euros bill. He calls customer service, they tell him they can't refund him again. He says he wants to cancel his account then, and gets transferred to retentions. I was the lucky retentions rep that got the call.\n\nThe guy has stayed on my memory as the most entitled piece of shit I ever had the displeasure to speak to. He even said that if we kept him at the phone for much longer, he would have to charge us for his time, because he was important and his time was worth a lot of money. Did I mute him and laughed on his face? Of course.\n\nHe was demanding that we credit his roaming charges again because we had done it before. The charges were abusive (he had a point there, roaming was ridiculously expensive back in the day). I told him no about seven times, he kept insisting that we open a claim to refund him or escalate the call. There was no one I could escalate the call to, and as satisfying as it was to tell the guy no over and over, I needed to cut the call short.\n\nSo I told him that okay, since he was so insistent I would open a claim to refund him the 1500 bill, and muted him while I opened the claim. The asshole was gloating at his girlfriend that he was going to get this bill refunded too. Meanwhile, I was copypasting the notes from the previous month claim, where the rep had written: \"I've informed customer of roaming charges in all the countries he told me he could be visiting (list of European countries)\".\n\nThe asshole had not read the terms and conditions of the accounts, but I had. Trying to defraud the company was grounds for service termination. I got the claim number, flagged down my supervisor and told her to please send it to headquarters so fraud could examine the account.\n\nI told the guy that the claim had been opened, but also that since it was obvious he was trying to abuse the company's policies, the claim had been flagged to be reviewed by fraud and it was likely his account would be terminated. He went from entitled to worried in two seconds and asked me to close the claim.

For me, Solas barely registered until I heard Flemeth call him \"Dread Wolf\". \n\nI would have done a solavellan run or three just the same if he was a woman because most of the interest I have on the character comes from the fact that he's an ancient elven god and quite possibly the next game's villain. A female Solas would still be an ancient elven god and quite possibly the next game's villain.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI don't think Cullen would be nearly as popular as a woman, though. I don't think a female Cullen would be on DAI, for starters. The Broken circle does not put him under a very flattering light (regardless of the Warden's origin Cullen acts like a dick asking for Kinloch Hold to be annulled), he's not very sympathetic in DA2 either (the \"mages are not people\" misquote and the fact that you only see his character development if you side with the templars), so I don't think Female Cullen would have had such a big fanbase that the devs would have thought to have the character as a LI in DAI. \n\nIf Female Cullen was in DAI even without that fanbase, I still think he wouldn't have been so popular. I don't think he would have received the Viv treatment (Vivienne's problem is not only that she's a Circle loyalist, but her personality and ambition are not very loved either) but I don't think he would have been written the same way as woman, given how ME's most traumatised character (Jack) is pricky and aggressive instead of adorkable.

And Japan did not allow women in the army in any other post until this type of dress was even more out of fashion.\n\nIn the same way, women's fashion during the Meiji restoration could go two ways: Japanese traditional clothing (kimonos) or western clothes heavily influenced by Japanese traditional clothing (sewn in a western pattern using fabrics that you would use on a kimono - this was also done by haute couture designers in the west because kimono fabrics can be astonishing). Of course, there were normal western dresses using normal fabrics, but that belt looks out of place even there.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt's more likely that she was a westerner in Japan (and married to a Japanese if you have Japanese ancestry, even though mixed marriage between a female westerner and a male Japanese was legal but unheard of - the opposite was a bit more common) because beyond that belt, nothing looks Japanese here.

There's the equivalent of an interstate and some railways between the town and the beach, and some areas of the town look downright ugly, but it's pretty close to Barcelona.
