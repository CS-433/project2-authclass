Ive been rethinking everything, and I feel like I\u2019ve gone too far away, I feel so disconnected from my past self and Im hating it, despite that being my original intention 3-4 years ago. I don\u2019t like how my name is so different form my birthname and I\u2019m seriously considering changing it, back to (my original name), just to feel more like myself again and be able to remember that who I was is still who I am. I went to far and I don\u2019t feel like myself anymore. I understand why I did what I did 4 years ago, I wanted to run away from things that made me uncomfortable instead of growing through them and confronting my faults. I regret it with everything I am today. I know I shouldn\u2019t be mad at my past self, I was barely 12, and I wanted to distance myself from my past because I wasn\u2019t mature enough to look at it critically. I wanted away from the pain of it all so I imitated a warped version of me, someone else that didn\u2019t resemble me at all to avoid that pain instead of confronting it. \n\nTo make matters worse, two years ago, I recognized that my attempt at \u2018becoming myself\u2019 made me feel awful, so instead of looking at it through a clearer lens and learning from my mistake, I went even further down the rabbit hole and didn\u2019t recognize that I was just growing back into the girl I always was. So my second new name was even further away from my birthname, and it only took two years for me to figure that out and now I don\u2019t know what to do. I want to go back so badly.
