I already tried to prepare and crystallize Fe(urea)6 sulfamate, but failed. Now, I see that the failures were due to high solubility of this compound \nand bad quality of my samples.\n\n### Properties\n\nSolubility of this compound is very high, exceeding 100g/100ml. Saturated solution has high viscosity. Crystal shape is the same as in chloride or chlorate: short rods with hexagonal cross-section and trigonal caps.\nCrystal system is probably trigonal. My samples are distorted because they were growing in a small vessel, and high viscosity of the mother liquor caused uneven development of faces.\n\nDespite high solubility, they are not hygroscopic, and store quite well. Several weeks of exposure to air did not cause any deterioration.\n\nIn the daylight crystals appear greenish, somewhat similar to Mohr's salt (albeit their color is less saturated then the latter). But in the incandescent light, they are almost colorless, having only slight dull blue coloration (see image #3).\n\n\n### Preparation\n\nPreparation of the complex is simple: take solution of Fe(III) sulfamate, add 6x molar amount of urea, then let the solution evaporate at room temperature. \n\nPreparation of Fe(III) sulfamate is slightly more complex though. Sulfamic acid does not react with Fe(OH)3, even freshly precipitated, so direct preparation is not possible. I found two working methods of preparation:\n\n1) *Metathesis reaction* of Fe(III) sulfate and Ca sulfamate. The former can be prepared by reaction of Fe(OH)3 with dilute H2SO4, and the latter by reaction of CaCO3 with sulfamic acid. \nThis reacton produced copious amount of gypsum precipitate, so vacuum filtering is required, or else the yield would be low. Also, gypsum has lo but nonzero solubility, and small amount of it would precipitate later, contaminating the product.\n\n2) *Oxidation* of Fe(II) sulfamate by H2O2. This method produces the best results. First prepare FeCO3 by reaction of FeSO4 and NaHCO3. Wash it, add small amount of water and 1.5 mols of sulfamic acid.\nFeCO3 would easily dissolve, producing green Fe(II) sulfamate (though the solution would be opaqued due to undissolved Fe(III) oxidation products).

Example: mix sodium sulfate and lead acetate - obtain white precipitate of lead sulfate, and sodium acetate remaining in the solution\n* A double salt or complex can form. You generally can't predict this theoretically, only literature search could tell you when this happens. Double salt is a salt that contains ions from two different salts. A good example is copper calcium acetate. Copper acetate produces dark green, almost black prismatic crystals, calcium acetate - colorles needles, and if you mix them together, you get blue prisms [like these](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-HvPvFwzmf2Y/Uy7dQuetdxI/AAAAAAAAF8w/Mfc4gEWBaa4/s4000/3-crystals-good1.JPG). I love complexes and double salts.\n* A solid solution could form. This happens when you mix two salts, that produce very similar crystals. If you mix them, you get a mixed crystal, where some ions are randomly replaced by different ions. Unlike double salts, such crystals don't have a definite composition, their composition depends on amounts of salts mixed. Nice example: alums.

My opinion is: once you can ride steadily and confident that you won't give up this hobby soon then you are ready to buy 36\".", "created_utc": "1618423877.0", "edited": "False", "id": "guij8jd", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_mqrsrw", "parent_id": "t3_mqrsrw", "score": "1", "subreddit": "unicycling", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rf91"}, {"author": "dmishin", "body": "It probably contains a mixture of ammoniuum and potassium phosphates.", "created_utc": "1618085979.0", "edited": "False", "id": "gu2t4le", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_moc1m6", "parent_id": "t3_moc1m6", "score": "2", "subreddit": "ExplosionsAndFire", "subreddit_id": "t5_3pqg8"}, {"author": "dmishin", "body": "> \u043d\u0435 \u0441\u043f\u043e\u043d\u0441\u0438\u0440\u0443\u044e\u0442 \u0438 \u043d\u0435 \u0440\u0430\u0437\u0432\u0438\u0432\u0430\u044e\u0442, \u0438\u0431\u043e \u0440\u0443\u0445\u043d\u0435\u0442 \u0438\u0434\u0435\u044f \u0442\u0435\u0445 \u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0431\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0448\u0438\u043d\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e\n\n\u041a\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0435 \u043c\u043e\u0437\u0433\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0435 \u0437\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0445\u0440\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u043b\u044e\u0431\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u0435\u0439 \u043f\u0441\u0435\u0432\u0434\u043e\u043d\u0430\u0443\u043a\u0438: \u0443\u0447\u0435\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u0441\u043a\u0440\u044b\u0432\u0430\u044e\u0442, \u043f\u043e\u0442\u043e\u043c\u0443 \u0447\u0442\u043e \u0435\u0441\u043b\u0438 \u0438\u0441\u0442\u0438\u043d\u0443 \u043e\u0442\u043a\u0440\u044b\u0442\u044c, \u0442\u043e \u0432\u0441\u0435 \u0438\u0445 \u0442\u0435\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0438 \u043e\u043f\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0440\u0433\u043d\u0443\u0442 (\u0430 \u0443 \u0441\u0430\u043c\u0438\u0445 \u0443\u0447\u0435\u043d\u044b\u0445, \u0432\u0438\u0434\u0438\u043c\u043e, \u043e\u0442\u0431\u0435\u0440\u0443\u0442 \u0441\u0442\u0435\u043f\u0435\u043d\u0438 \u0438 \u043e\u0442\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u044f\u0442 \u043d\u0430 \u0437\u0430\u0432\u043e\u0434). \u041c\u043d\u0435 \u043a\u0430\u0436\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f - \u044d\u0442\u043e \u0442\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043c\u0430 \u043e\u0442 \u0448\u043a\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043e\u0431\u0443\u0447\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f, \u0433\u0434\u0435 \u0438\u0437\u0443\u0447\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u043d\u0430\u0443\u043a \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0434\u0438\u0442\u0441\u044f \u043a \u0442\u043e\u043c\u0443, \u0447\u0442\u043e\u0431\u044b \u0434\u0430\u0432\u0430\u0442\u044c \u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0438\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u043e\u0442\u0432\u0435\u0442\u044b \u043d\u0430 \u0437\u0430\u0434\u0430\u0447\u0438, \u0430 \u0442\u0435\u0445, \u043a\u0442\u043e \u0434\u0430\u0451\u0442 \u043d\u0435\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0438\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0435 - \u043d\u0430\u043a\u0430\u0437\u044b\u0432\u0430\u044e\u0442.", "created_utc": "1617805245.0", "edited": "False", "id": "gtovp8m", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_mlk7rq", "parent_id": "t1_gto032l", "score": "4", "subreddit": "Popular_Science_Ru", "subreddit_id": "t5_12653g"}, {"author": "dmishin", "body": "Uneven development of faces is generally caused by convection.

If C is not discrete, then F,G define two commuting diagrams in D (the images of C,D), and natural transformation must connect them so that resulting diagram also commutes.\n\nParticularly, if C is a one-object discrete category **1**, then functors **1**\\->D are objects in D, and natural transformations are arrows.\n\nIf C has 2 objects and one non-identity arrow: 1->2, then functors are arrows in D, and natural transformations are commuting squares, built on two arrows.\n\n**2 Intuition from Haskell**\n\nNatural transformations between functors Hask->Hask are just any functions of type F a -> G a where F, G are instances of Functor. For example, safeHead::\\[a\\]->Maybe a is a natural transformation between \\[\\] and Maybe.

The target product crystallizes first producing large, sugar-like, almost colorless crystals. When dusty sediment and dendrites start to appear in the solution, the evaporation must be stopped and the product must be separated. The yield was about 50%.\n\nI tried to use freshly prepared iron(III) sulfate instead of alum, but it was too acidic and caused the chlorate to decompose, producing noxious fumes.

This makes shape hard to understand, so I drew its shape in [smorf](http://www.smorf.nl/draw.php?json=q_a1UtI1Mc5V0vGz8tcJsKp2tDLWszQx03GC0s5WpnqGJhY6gVaWBjpBICIYSNTqhFhFV3tYGep4A7GPlZGOi5VhrQ6SiC5YSM_UtDa2FgA=)\n\nI got information about this crystal from /u/mrismuth who referred to \"Chemische Krystallographie\" by Paul Groth, which  states that the formula of this salt is K\u2085Na\u2081\u2089[Al(C\u2082O\u2084)\u2083]\u2088\u00b732H\u2082O.

Tetrahedral crystals of the double salt precipitate. They can be later redissolved in water and used for growing. Solubility is quite high, my own measurements give solubility slightly below 80g/100ml.\n\nCrystals appear to belong to the isometric crystal system, thus suggesting similarity to the sodium potassium ferrioxalate: https://imgur.com/gallery/j16EG https://imgur.com/gallery/wQQsM\n\nHowever, Na:K ratio is very different. If the formula from \"Chemische Krystallographie\" is right, then the similarity could be false.\n\nAlso, unlike the double ferrioxalate, alumooxalate crystallizes from the stoichiometric solution, which simplifies its preparation and purification (it can be easily recrystallized from water).\n\nCrystals appear to be completely stable.

I purchased a nice jar of pure creatine in a sport food shop.\n\n[Cyclamic acid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclamic_acid) is slightly less known. Its full name is N-cyclohexylsulfamic acid, and it is best known for its strong sweet taste.\nSodium salt of this acid, sodium cyclamate is a widely used artificial sweetener, now banned in some countries (but not in mine).\nI had a large amount of sodium cyclamate, obtained as a byproduct of [saccharin extraction](https://www.reddit.com/r/chemistry/comments/53gdf4/sweet_crystals_saccharin/) from commercial sweetener. \n\n\nSince then, I tried to prepare cyclamates of various ions, however all of them have quite boring appearance, resembling each other: very thin plates, like mica.\n\nThis is unsurprising, considering the structure of the cyclamate ion: it has two parts, strongly hydrophilic sulfonate and hydrophobic, bulky cyclohexyl.\n\nThis, *I believe*, causes crystals to assume layered structure, where hydrophobic layers alternate with hydrophylic. \nFor example, wide flat faces of sodium cyclamate crystals are slightly hydrophobic. I think, this is because they are covered with a cyclohexyls, sticking outside.\n\n\nSo I just continued experiments, and was very surprised when a mixture of cyclamic acid with creatine produced large, perfectly shaped crystals, very unlike any other cyclamate.\nLater I repeated the experiment on a bigger scale and managed to grow these nice crystals.\n\nPreparation: mix roughly stoichiometric amount of creatine and cyclamic acid and dissolve in room temperature water, then crystallize. I found that very slight (few %) of cyclamic acid is requried for full dissolution.\nDo not warm the solution: apparently, elevated temperature and high acidity causes transformation of creatine to creatinine, the latter producing boring thin plates with cyclamic acid.\nThe same transformation apparently happens at the room temperature too, but is slow enough.\n\n\nThe product has good solubility, around 40g/100cc.

They are not prone to dehydration.\n\nEdit: 1:1:2\u21921:1:4\n\nEdit2: 1:1:4\u21921:2:8  (must check before posting...)

I believe that I understand what affine space is: a space where you can translate elements by a vector, and for every two elements there is a translation; which is the same as vector space with origin forgotten.\n\nThen I see a definition of algebraic variety here: http://mathworld.wolfram.com/AlgebraicVariety.html\n\nand with the exception of \"more technical\" definition using \"scheme\" I understand what is algebraic variety in R^n or C^n. But then, there comes \"Actually, ... are examples of affine varieties because they are in affine space\". This makes little sense to me. Well, yes, R^n or C^n are linear spaces, and every linear space is indeed an affine space too. But this seems tautological. How can variety in R^n or C^n be *not* affine? Even if we consider arbitrary k-algebra K, it will be a linear space, and thus - an affine space too.\n\nAs another try, I have also started reading this: http://www.math.lsa.umich.edu/~idolga/631.pdf\n\nand it directly defines affine algebraic variety as an equivalence class of system of equations (end of page 2). OK, I have no problem with that.

However, the color can be different in coordination complexes such as intensely green ferrioxalates.\n\nThe crystals on this photo have their delicate blue color thanks to the complex of Fe(III) with 6 molecules or urea: hexakis(urea) iron(III).

In hot water, it  decomposes to potassium oxalate and copper oxalate. However, it can be  dissolved in hot solution of potassium oxalate.\n\nBecause of its low solubility I was not able to use evaporation growing  method. Instead, I used repeated supersaturation: dissolve raw material in hot  potassium oxalate solution; cool it down; put a seed in it. Seed grows  for a day, after that it is extracted and the process is repeated. This way, crystal grows in quick spurs, which has bad effect on its  shape. \n\nCrystals are stable.\n\nPreparation is simple: make hot solution of potassium oxalate, then dissolve any copper salt in it while stirring. It should produce clean blue solution, if it turns cloudy, then add more K2C2O4. After cooling, crystals appear. Often, violet needles of tetrahydrate appear first, but then they redissolve while rhombic blue crystals of dihydrate grow.  \nAnother preparation is here: [https://thosci.com/synthesis-of-copperii-oxalate-copper-bisoxalate/](https://thosci.com/synthesis-of-copperii-oxalate-copper-bisoxalate/)", "created_utc": "1571006566.0", "edited": "False", "id": "f3o27qc", "is_submitter": "True", "link_id": "t3_dhhp5g", "parent_id": "t3_dhhp5g", "score": "9", "subreddit": "crystalgrowing", "subreddit_id": "t5_3a2xd"}, {"author": "dmishin", "body": ">Going down the stairs in a laundry basket...wcgw?\n\nDoes it *ever* go right?", "created_utc": "1570997509.0", "edited": "False", "id": "f3netob", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_dh6qza", "parent_id": "t3_dh6qza", "score": "5", "subreddit": "Whatcouldgowrong", "subreddit_id": "t5_2x2oy"}, {"author": "dmishin", "body": "The way she speaks, like with a mouth full of saliva, gets me every time.   \nKan'ippatsu datta wa ne", "created_utc": "1570961137.0", "edited": "False", "id": "f3k2wfb", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_dh7z2v", "parent_id": "t3_dh7z2v", "score": "731", "subreddit": "anime", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh22"}, {"author": "dmishin", "body": "Are 6 month trial periods normal in America?

It is somewhat rudimentary, but still worth giving it a click or two. Seems that the link to the wiki was lost after redesign, so I've just re-enabled it. By the way, everyone is welcome to edit it.\n\nAt home, you are mostly limited to growing crystals from solutions using one of two methods: slow cooling of solution, and slow evaporation. First is faster (usually it takes one day to complete), second is slower (weeks to years if you are really patient), but the size of the crystal is only limited by your luck and patience.\n\nPredominately, you are going to use water as solvent, so you can grow crystals of any chemical that is soluble in water. However, some chemicals crystallize easier than others. With moderate efforts, you can grow nice crystals of [alum, copper sulfate, ammonium dihydrogen phosphate](https://www.reddit.com/r/crystalgrowing/wiki/guides/recommended_compounds_for_beginners) \\- these are \"traditional\" compounds that can be found on every crystal growing competition. But there are many others. I personally liked [erythritol](https://i.imgur.com/dL4tCoC.jpg) (sugar substitute) very much. \n\nI am not a native English speaker, so could not be an expert here, but gem is not the same as crystal. At least because some gems (such as opals) are not crystals (not single crystals at least).\n\nYou definitely can not grow at home any kind of crystal used in jewelry, such as emeralds. Crystal growing kits with \"emerald\", \"quartz\", \"amethyst\" in their names usually contain the abovementioned ammonium dihydrogen phosphate (which is naturally colorless) and colorant. Still, it forms nice elongated crystals.\n\nThe information on Len Cram's opals reeks of pseudo-science.\n\nSpeaking of equipment, the only must-have thing is a smooth-walled container of appropriate size.

Dissolve copper sulfate (calculated amount) in appropriate amount of water\n2. Add baking soda to the solution in small portions, stirring after each addition. Warning: this produces a lot of foam and bubbling, use high walled container and think about possible spill. It is fine to use excess of soda.\n3. Wash the precipitate: let the green-blue precipitate to settle down (it requires a hour or so), remove and discard the remaining solution, then add clean water and stir. Repeat this 2 times, obtaining finally clean wet precipitate of basic copper carbonate.\n4. Add sulfamic acid to the wet precipitate. Again, do it in small portions, it produces a lot of foaming. After adding, heat it a bit (do not boil). All precipitate must dissolve, forming deep blue clear solution. If it is still opaque, add a bit more acid and stir. You've got copper sulfamate. \n5.

If nothing precipitated then you had too much water, move to the next step.\n8. Pour the remaining blue-green solution to a flat dish and let it evaporate over several days. Again, blue-black crystals would form. Do not let the solution to dry completely, collect the crystals and discard the last small portion. Warning: if you have excess of acid, the solution could have light, but noticeable acrid smell of hydrochloric acid. Better do not do it in home (though I did). Also, do not boil the solution: it would decompose.\n9. If some other crystals form in parallel (transparent or light blue) - discard them if possible.\n10.

This can be achieved by many reducing agents: ascorbic acid, sulfites, alkaline solution of sulfur etc.", "created_utc": "1556194315.0", "edited": "False", "id": "elqmc2h", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_bg28aq", "parent_id": "t3_bg28aq", "score": "3", "subreddit": "crystalgrowing", "subreddit_id": "t5_3a2xd"}, {"author": "dmishin", "body": "\u041c\u044b \u0441\u043b\u044b\u0448\u0430\u043b\u0438, \u0442\u0435\u0431\u0435 \u0441\u0442\u0443\u043a\u043d\u0443\u043b\u043e 40 \u043b\u0435\u0442?", "created_utc": "1556191646.0", "edited": "False", "id": "elqjiaj", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_bh70bn", "parent_id": "t3_bh70bn", "score": "1", "subreddit": "Pikabu", "subreddit_id": "t5_2tzr0"}, {"author": "dmishin", "body": "\u041f\u0440\u0435\u0441\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0443\u0442\u044b\u0435 \u0435\u0431\u0435\u043d\u044f\u0447\u044c\u0438 \u0447\u0435\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0447\u043a\u0438", "created_utc": "1556189019.0", "edited": "False", "id": "elqh8xr", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_bh64cu", "parent_id": "t3_bh64cu", "score": "2", "subreddit": "Pikabu", "subreddit_id": "t5_2tzr0"}, {"author": "dmishin", "body": "\u0421\u0443\u0442\u044c \u0432 \u0442\u043e\u043c, \u0447\u0442\u043e \u043e\u0442 \u0438\u043d\u0435\u0440\u0442\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0433\u0430\u0437\u0430 \u0447\u0435\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0435\u043a \u043d\u0435 \u043e\u0449\u0443\u0449\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0443\u0434\u0443\u0448\u044c\u044f. \u041f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e \u0442\u0435\u043c\u043d\u0435\u0435\u0442 \u0432 \u0433\u043b\u0430\u0437\u0430\u0445 \u0438 \u0447\u0435\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0435\u043a \u043e\u0442\u043a\u043b\u044e\u0447\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f. \u041c\u044b \u0442\u0430\u043a \u0437\u0430\u0431\u0430\u0432\u043d\u043e \u0443\u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0435\u043d\u044b, \u0447\u0442\u043e \u0447\u0443\u0432\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0443\u0435\u043c \u0443\u0434\u0443\u0448\u044c\u0435 \u043d\u0435 \u043a\u043e\u0433\u0434\u0430 \u043d\u0430\u043c \u043d\u0435 \u0445\u0432\u0430\u0442\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u043a\u0438\u0441\u043b\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0430, \u0430 \u043a\u043e\u0433\u0434\u0430 \u0441\u043a\u0430\u043f\u043b\u0438\u0432\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0443\u0433\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0438\u0441\u043b\u044b\u0439 \u0433\u0430\u0437.", "created_utc": "1556187366.0", "edited": "False", "id": "elqfzg9", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_bh50id", "parent_id": "t1_elq6y9s", "score": "7", "subreddit": "Pikabu", "subreddit_id": "t5_2tzr0"}, {"author": "dmishin", "body": "I can totally relate as another   \u1405\u0301\u0301\u0307\u030c\u0354\u0318\u14d0\u030f\u030f\u036e\u0331\u032d\u0348\u14c4\u0304\u033c\u0345\u0331\u0319\u140a\u030c\u0316\u0333\u0319\u0316\u0349\u032a\u1585\u0310\u0365\u035b\u0304\u0318\u146e\u031a\u0364\u035b\u0309\u0308\u0352\u033c\u035a\u14c7\u035b\u034b\u0369\u0354\u035a\u1585\u034c\u0331\u033b\u0359\u031c\u0339\u033a\u034e   owner.
