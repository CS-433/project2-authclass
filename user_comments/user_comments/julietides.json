I wrote this comment a week ago thinking how unlikely it was that anybody would click the link and read this (honestly, amazing) book. But here you are, you found it! And so you made my day as well.\n\nI mean, historically, many imperial and local powers have done their best to steal the possibilities of great literature being written in the Belarusian language but, as you see, it's impossible to always succeed in such an endeavour, especially with such a creative and resilient people (I myself am not Belarusian, just a foreign Belarusian philologist, so lemme praise you guys).\n\nThe only thanks I need is for you to enjoy that book \u2014 I believe everyone in Belarus should know it and I hope there'll be a new education system in place soon that'll make sure of it. Let me know what you think, by the way! :)", "created_utc": "1639471406.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hohnoj0", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_r9q8nr", "parent_id": "t1_hog356m", "score": "2", "subreddit": "literature", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhps"}, {"author": "julietides", "body": "\u0412\u044b\u0434\u0430\u0442\u043d\u044b \u0441\u043f\u0456\u0441!
