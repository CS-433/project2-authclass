I really love traveling, and have already been to a lot of different countries, but I wanted to visit more Spanish speaking countries for immersion. I went this past July. I went to El Salvador, Nicaragua and Costa Rica. I stayed in hostels, Airbnbs, and stayed with friends too. All three are pretty affordable counties, but Costa Rica is definitely the most expensive. I definitely could have done the trip for cheaper, but some of the places I stayed at were more \u201cupscale\u201d and I did a lot of activities too. You could definitely get a bed in a dorm for like $10 a night in Nicaragua though if you want to do the trip on a budget. Food is pretty cheap too. Overall, it was a wonderful experience, and I\u2019d highly recommend it! The Spanish varied a bit in each country too. The accent in Nicaragua was the most challenging for me, while the accent in Costa Rica was more neutral. I think my Spanish definitely improved because you\u2019re forced to use it. Nobody in Nicaragua or El Salvador spoke English, but in the more touristy parts of Costa Rica, everyone knew English, but I still insisted on speaking Spanish. I\u2019m hoping to do South America next summer.

He asked me to join him. I prefer to travel alone, but thought I\u2019d give it a shot. So wanting to do my own thing maybe like 15% of the trip is self centered? I didn\u2019t tell him I\u2019m going to ditch him, I just told him I am going to need some alone time to do my own thing occasionally. I need my space sometimes, and two weeks with anyone is a lot. I just don\u2019t want someone glued to my hip all the time. We also have some different interests. For example, he doesn\u2019t like dancing but I do, so I\u2019ll go out dancing by myself one night, and he can do his own thing. He also wants to do this 2 hour tour that\u2019s $150. I\u2019m not super interested, so while he goes and does that, I\u2019ll meet my friend. Not seeing how any of this is an issue. It\u2019s a lot of money for something I am not interested in. I wouldn\u2019t expect him to fork over that much money to do an activity I want to do, but he doesn\u2019t. I\u2019d just go myself. We\u2019re staying in the same Airbnb, just got different rooms, so we\u2019re going to be together a lot. I didn\u2019t say he\u2019s going to ruin my vacation, but while planning, I just realized we are very different travelers. He also kind of made it seem like he\u2019s an experienced traveler and knows what he\u2019s doing to impress me, but I think he kind of embellished that a bit\u2026 I\u2019m just trying to be mature and talk about our feelings and expectations ahead of time to avoid conflicts.

He just traveled around with his then girlfriend the entire time. Anyway, I\u2019m willing to compromise, but this particular tour he wants to go on is a $150 zip lining tour. I\u2019m terrified of heights, and I think that\u2019s a lot of money to spend for something I don\u2019t want to do. If it was some $20 walking tour or whatever, I\u2019d yo no problem, but that\u2019s a lot of money for a college student for a 2 hour activity.
