Norwegian is not quite so simple.\n\nThis is going to be hard to explain in text, so bear with me.\n\nI'm going to start with the first and most distinct one: RS. This sound is found in words like No**rs**k. It's a blend of a sort of \"sh\" sound with the \"r\" at the same time. Pretty simple, I hope.\n\nThe next two are more difficult because there's no way for English to differentiate. You'll just have to look it up and listen. There are lots of spellings, but I'll focus on two: SKJ and SJ. Think of SKJ as a heavier pronunciation, while SJ is lighter. If you make the \"sh\" sound with a smile or with the corners of your mouth pulled back, you will get SKJ. If you make it with pursed lips like you're shushing someone, you will get SJ. Here, you can see the K is not silent; rather, it contributes to the sound.\n\nSometimes, SK is pronounced like an S and a K (sk\u00e5l), but sometimes it is like SJ (unnskyld). I don't know a solid rule for this. You may just need to learn as you go.\n\nAn -ig at the end of a word is comparable to -y in English, but pronounced more like a short i. Many definite neuter nouns are going to have the -t at the end be silent. Again, there are exceptions, but it's pretty safe to leave it off. Just make sure to always pronounce the -et if it's a past tense verb; it is never silent. \n\n\u00c5 is aa (like b**oa**t in English), \u00c6 is ae (like c**a**p), and \u00d8 is oe (like sh**ou**ld).\n\nWhat I wish I had known was that modal verbs could change tenses in Norwegian.

That first segment acts as an **adverb** for the *main verb* of the clause. \"**Sometimes**, she *is* here.\" In this example, \"**sometimes**\" specifically refers to \"*is*.\" We use a comma here in English because we've put our words out of order. \"**Sometimes**\" does not refer to \"she.\"\n\nIn Norwegian, instead of putting a comma, we move the *verb* so that it is next to the **adverbial clause**. Instead of mimicking English and writing, \"Noen ganger, hun er her,\" with the words out of order, we just make sure that the *verb* is touching the **adverb**. \"**Noen ganger** *er* hun her.\" This is what makes Norwegian a V2 language (verb 2nd) when English is not.

E.g., field, court, pitch, yard, rink, and park are all types of sports fields, and they're each only one syllable. Chaise, stool, chair, couch, and bench are all different types of seating, and they're only one syllable, as well. It also helps that we have a lot of different phonemes (specific sounds) to work with.\n\nAnother thing that helps us relate more information is our grammar. English is very heavy on tenses, mood, and syntax (word order), which help us convey when something has or will happen, under what conditions it might happen, whether it is fact or speculation, and how we perceive things to be. E.g., The sentence, \"I had been a princess,\" tells you that I was, in fact, a princess in a previous time and no longer am one now. Whereas the fragment, \"Had I been a princess,\" tells you that I was *not* a princess at the time the events occurred.

Make this fun. Go wild.\n\nWhat you need to do is make a very big graph. Give each character their own colored line, and plot out their arc. The lines should go up for the individual characters' exciting or tumultuous moments where they can shine, then down for reflective or quiet moments where they aren't doing much.\n\nWhat you should end up with is your MC's line looking something like your typical story plot line. He defines the story, so you should highlight his line to work around.\n\nNow, you'll want to completely ignore the MC line for a moment while you look at the other lines. If you've got any lines that are completely or mostly flat, you can merge/cut that character or give them a post. What I mean by giving them a post is that you should pick a setting\u2014such as a single shop, a castle, or even a person\u2014and keep them there. Do not let that character move around. They are a minor character only, and by giving them a fixed place, you are helping your reader remember them. Fantasy tends to have a lot of characters, and you need to make it digestible. (Have you ever recognized someone in public and wondered where you know them from? It's not a great feeling, and it's definitely not a feeling you should subject your readers to.) Give very minor characters a post and erase their arcs.\n\nNext, if there are any lines that look identical, you can safely merge those characters together or cut one entirely. Give important tasks and traits to remaining characters.\n\nAfter all that, it's time to consult the MC's line again. All the other lines should either look vaguely similar to the MC's line or look complementary (mirrored). You want your remaining arcs to play off each other in a way that allows the reader to enjoy every chapter and never feel rushed or overloaded. If there are any arcs that look like a three-year-old drew a random line on there, fix it, cut it, merge it, or reduce the role to a minor character.\n\nFinally, now that you have a manageable number of characters with real arcs, you can address the identites of your characters. You should no longer have any pointless token characters because the characters all have a role now. If you merged a pointless lady's arc with that of a man, you could make that man a lady *if you want*. It's all up to you.\n\nLike I said, make a day of this and make it fun.

The \"white savior\" trope is absolutely as offensive as it gets because it is just white supremacy in a fun, narrative format. POC also shouldn't serve primarily as a sacrifice for the white character.\n- POC in a fantasy setting are still POC, and your readers will read it this way no matter how hard you try to tell them that blackness on Mars isn't the same as blackness on Earth. It *is* the same because heritage cannot be wholly severed from appearance in an entire race. There are white and black Americans, and them both being born and raised in America does not make them the exact same.

I don't scroll through a page line by line, reading words or phrases. The big ones jump out at me, and I can't really help but follow those ones and ignore the smaller, less significant words. This sometimes makes for excellent speed reading, like in non-fiction literature found in science publications and whatnot. But in a narrative, it's really rough on me. Narratives usually flow chronologically, especially sentence to sentence. If you read the sentences or paragraphs out of order, the time is out of order. But trying to read in order like that is hard. I can't focus and it doesn't make sense. There's a lot of clutter. So I just don't bother. I read by what words are most important and piece the order out in my brain. It makes enough sense that I can still enjoy it. I take it a little too far for most people, though; I don't even read a series of books in order. I'll start in the middle of a book in the middle of the series and work my way around however I feel. The books are labelled in order, at least, so I still know what happens beginning/middle/end. It just gives me practice, I guess, so reading a single page out of order is really, really easy.\n\nPersonally, reading German is so much easier than English, even though I'm a native English-speaker who's lived in America all my life and didn't learn German until middle school. Word order matters much less in German, in favor of case, and articles are more important in German than they are in English. And every noun is capitalized, which keeps them from getting lost. I guess it just balances out more, in my brain. While I dont really read German in order, either, it doesn't matter nearly as much.\n\nNow, I've given myself a real headache replying to all these comments, so I'm gonna give my brain a rest, lol.", "created_utc": "1536789350.0", "edited": "False", "id": "e5vc8q1", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_9f9oaf", "parent_id": "t1_e5v1jhz", "score": "1", "subreddit": "writing", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh2n"}, {"author": "nostep-onsnek", "body": "That's what I try to do, thanks!

People already know that the sky is blue and that dog wear leashes on walks. That stuff is boring and doesn't add any new information.    \n- Note the things that stand out, and use all the senses. What makes this object or person different from its surroundings? Why do you notice it? What about is different than you'd expect? How does the MC feel about it? Do I need to use this as an oppurtunity to do some worldbuilding?    \n- Toss out the words I'd usually use if I were having a conversation with someone. Old, red, tall. Those leave way too much work up to the reader and leave them with a rather cartoony impression.    \n- Grab a thesaurus. The English language has *so* many words, and brevity is the soul of wit. If I can describe something in exquisite detail with one or two words that won't go above people's heads, I'll do it. **However**, if it's something that's being studied for an extended period of time, more words is better. I like the reader to experience the world the way the MC does.    \n- It's okay to kind of make up words. Hyphens are your friend. Just describe the thing the way you do when you're thinking to yourself, and if it makes sense, keep it.    \n- Don't *just* use adjectives. Remember that you're still in a scene. Use verbs and interesting nouns. Spice it up. If you stick to a pattern, every sentence will start the same way, and nobody wants to read that.\n\nI think that kind of sums it up.

A doctor needs a deeper understanding that these substances, called electrolytes, conduct electricity and keep our muscles moving. When a current runs from your brain to your muscles, electrons are running down a path of low resistance in your body (the nerves) and into your muscles. Most of these electrolytes are missing electrons. The electrons jump to the positive electrolytes that need them and they stop repelling each other, so now the layers of tissues housing the electrolytes slide along each other to line up close and pass along electrons they no longer need, and the muscle contracts. If you don't have those substances in your muscles, then the energy just diffuses through your muscles in the form of heat, and a marathon would turn you into a steak dinner.
