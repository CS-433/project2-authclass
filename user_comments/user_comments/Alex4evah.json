Interacting with natives from as early on as possible is also ideal. There are many apps which tackle those things separately but you can't just find one \"best\" app to meet all your needs. For example, italki is a nice platform where you can take lessons with natives. There's the HiNative app for when you bump into something which you can't decipher or make sense of through Google alone - you can post there about it and have natives reply. As for immersion, you could use just about anything: Youtube, Spotify for podcasts/videos, and pretty much Google is your friend when trying to look up any sort of content in your target language. Also, check out this [Resources Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/languagelearning/wiki/resources/) for resources pertaining to likely any language you'd need - also join the subreddit for learners of the language, there's one for most languages.

Besides that, he's been shown to attach to children, and to express the need to protect them, as he feels they're unsupervised and abandoned by their irresponsible parents (and that relates to what his situation was in his childhood - his mother would always found an excuse to abandon him in a supermarket, to be able to go on a date with some random guy; that, and the fact that she couldn't break up with Joe's father). It's been shown to us throughout the series that this is how he actually operates (hence not wanting to kill the real Will or Delilah, as they were not associated strongly enough with Love - and not posing a threat to Ellie). His behavior has always been in opposition to her mother's: he's not just leaving everything as is - he acts independently, decisively, and on the spot (exactly the opposite to his mother's way of solving issues - for example, the scene with the man who came to pick them up when they were running from Joe's father, he thought it was not right for there to be anyone else involved in this, as he just wanted to be with his mother). The girls that he falls in love with somewhat resemble an idealized version of his mother: seemingly innocent, vulnerable, in need for love and protection. This season though, both Ellie and Love turn up to be exactly the opposite versions of those types; and that makes Joe question his actions for the first time, as he beings to realize that his thought process is flawed; he ends up wanting to stay locked up in the cage and die, rather than having to deal with Love (a version of Joe). He realizes he deserves punishment (he sort of gets it when he moves with Love to a new house - he describes the neighborhood as a cold-less Siberia). However, he is still unable to control his urges, because the damage that has been done throughout his childhood can never be undone (I remember the scene when Delilah, I believe, told him that if one's truly screwed, they should just move on, and hope the demons won't outrun them).

Some of the ingredients that help combat dark spots and uneven skin tone are niacinamide, azelaic acid and alpha arbutin. These work by interacting with the cells in our skin that produce our natural pigment (melanin). Also, increasing the epidermal cell turnover with a chemical exfoliant (AHA, BHA or PHA - a  salicylic acid, which is a BHA, might benefit you the most, since it's mild and you also suffer from oily skin) or a retinol helps reveal new, fresher skin. Research products that are fragrance free and that contain those ingredients, and find what's best suited for your budget. The Ordinary has products that contain pretty much all of those ingredients. As far as I know, niacinamide and retinols are proven to work through a lot of research, so you could start with those. If you've never used a retinol before, start with a product that has a low concentration of active ingredient (like The Ordinary's 0.2% Retinol). You can use the niacinamide both morning and evening, if you're not using a vitamin C product, since those should not be applied at the same time on the skin. The retinol you can start by using once a week, and then slowly increase the rate, as your skin builds up tolerance. You should apply it after your moisturizer has dried, and only in the evening. I don't recommend applying it before moisturizing since your skin is sensitive, and also don't overuse it; 3 small drops should be enough. Since retinol is a quite potent ingredient, it can irritate or purge you in the first week/month after application, but if that lasts any longer or more serious concerns emerge, you should stop using the product.

It's been shown that fragrance is one of our worst enemies when it comes to skin care, alongside sun exposure and other bad stuff.\n\nSince your skin is sensitive but still requires good cleansing, I'd recommend you double-cleansing. It consists of an oil-based cleanser and a regular cleanser. The oil cleanser helps dissolve sebum/whatever builds up in your pores throughout the day and other substances from your SPF/make-up that are not water-soluble, thus providing a deep cleanse without stripping or irritating your skin. Then you follow up with a water-based, hydrating cleanser (such as CeraVe's Moisturizing Cleanser and the Matcha Hemp Hydrating Cleanser from Krave Beauty), to rinse all of that off. Oil cleanser options: The Ordinary's Squalane Cleanser, Hadalabo Cleansing Oil, DHC Deep Cleansing Oil, Then I Met You Cleansing Balm.\n\nNow, the active ingredients. There are multiple active ingredients suitable for acne prone skin. Niacinamide is one of them, and I've mentioned the benefits in my previous post. The one from The Ordinary, which also contains zinc, would be a really good product for you. Also, a good product containing matcha/green tea could also benefit you a lot, through its antioxidant and mildly-astringent properties (for example, the Matcha Hemp Hydrating Cleanser from Krave Beauty). Although it might seem counterintuitive, a facial oil high in linoleic acid can further help regulating the amount of sebum produced by the skin (such as The Ordinary's Rose Hip oil). When it comes to exfoliation, chemical should be the only SAFE way to go. I'd recommend a salicylic acid serum, since the molecule is soluble in oil and can penetrate your pores, providing a deep but mild exfoliation (The Ordinary has a Salicylic Acid 2% serum). Never use physical exfoliants or facial brushes or whatever. Those are mostly really bad and harmful and irritating.\n\nAn antioxidant serum can also help in the morning, like a Vitamin C one from The Ordinary (the Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate 10% would be a great place to start, for example).\n\nA good SPF is also of great importance. Without SPF, pretty much any other products run into the risk of being rendered completely useless. La Roche-Posay makes a good, fragrance-free sunscreen (Anthelios Shaka Fluid SPF 50+). EltaMD also has great sunscreens, The Ordinary also does. Everything in your skin care should be fragrance free.\n\nLast, moisturizer. CeraVe makes really good moisturizers, suitable for all skin types. Either the Moisturizing Cream or the Moisturizing Daily Lotion should do the job.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\nAM: Wash your face with water only or just the water-based cleanser; Vitamin C; Niacinamide + Zinc **if you're not using a Vitamin C** (niacinamide and Vitamin C *should not* be combined); moisturizer; SPF.\n\nPM: Rub the oil on your dry skin, then add a bit of water to emulsify, and wash off before applying the water-based cleanser; use the salicylic acid on your completely dry face, after cleansing, than wait a bit before applying your next products (you can start by using this once a week for a while, and then increase the frequency as your skin builds up tolerance); Niacinamide + Zinc; moisturizer; facial oil and we're done! \n\nThis should be a basic, efficient routine, and you can't run into too much trouble with these products since they're not harsh at all. If your skin concerns become worse, the best thing to do is to seek medical attention from a good dermatologist.", "created_utc": "1569256225.0", "edited": "False", "id": "f18dpoe", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_d80x67", "parent_id": "t1_f185i2w", "score": "6", "subreddit": "SkincareAddicts", "subreddit_id": "t5_37kq2"}, {"author": "Alex4evah", "body": "This is such a great compliment, thank you so much!", "created_utc": "1569240297.0", "edited": "False", "id": "f17bpl3", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_d80x67", "parent_id": "t1_f17avhg", "score": "9", "subreddit": "SkincareAddicts", "subreddit_id": "t5_37kq2"}, {"author": "Alex4evah", "body": "Thank you!

Even though it might seem strange to put oil on your already oily skin, the excess sebum that builds up on the skin and in our pores cannot dissolve in a water-based formula, and maybe even certain ingredients from your SPF and such. Micellar water does a similar job, but I don't find it as effective. Then I Met You has a nice, [fragrance-free cleansing balm](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwi-9pHj4KHkAhXBY1AKHR9oCLIQFjAAegQIAxAB&url=https%3A%2F%2Fthenimetyou.com%2Fproducts%2Fliving-cleansing-balm&usg=AOvVaw3zE09pH4cnXp58Hcfvvzuq).\n\nWhen building up a skin care routine, the most important things to look for are skin barrier support and sun protection. For your skin to be happy, you have to provide a good SPF, gentle cleansing and proper hydration through a good moisturizer. By looking at the ingredient list of your Isis Pharma moisturizer, I came to the conclusion that you should definitely replace it. It contains a lot of fragrance, which should definitely be avoided in skin care, and it also contains a really harsh surfactant, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, that is just terrible for the face. Sodium Laureth Sulfate is basically the stuff that makes up regular soap, which we all know we should not put on our faces. It really strips the skin, and can definitely lead to skin barrier damage that will worsen your skin concerns (breakouts, comedones, dullness etc.). A much, much better option would be the [CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser](https://www.amazon.com/CeraVe-Hydrating-Facial-Cleanser-Fragrance/dp/B01MSSDEPK/ref=sr_1_2?crid=206RQJ82X2SDL&keywords=cerave+hydrating+cleanser&qid=1566862193&s=gateway&sprefix=cerave+hydr%2Caps%2C333&sr=8-2), that is fragrance-free, non-comedogenic, MUCH gentler and hydrating. It contains ceramides, compounds that are present in our skin's own moisturizing system. Your cleanser is by far the worst product in your routine and you should replace it in my opinion.\n\nWhen it comes to the exfoliating acids, I think you'll do a much better job preventing breakouts and smoothing your skin texture by using your Salicylic Acid as a primary exfoliant, since it does basically the same job as the Lactic Acid, but it also has the property of being soluble in oil, thus unclogging your pores while also providing a gentle exfoliation. Salicylic Acid also can help with controlling excess sebum production and it also has antibacterial properties. Be aware that the overuse of chemical exfoliants can lead to irritation, dryness, redness and peeling, so maybe use them a few times a week, and don't apply them on areas where you don't experience congestion. You can switch to using the Salicylic Acid on your breakout-prone, textured areas, 2-3 days a week, and see if your skin tolerates it well. If not, you can go back to the Lactic Acid. Do not use your chemical exfoliants on the sensitive parts of the face, such as the under-eye area, as it's simply unnecessary, and the risk of getting irritated is much higher on the extremely thin skin under our eyes.\n\nI'll have to mention fragrance again when talking about your moisturizer. It's definitely not as bad as your cleanser, but I'd look into other options that are fragrance-free, such as [CeraVe's Moisturizing Cream](https://www.amazon.com/CeraVe-Moisturizing-Cream-Daily-Moisturizer/dp/B00TTD9BRC), that is also non-comedogenic and contains ceramides.\n\nThe SPF you're using is most likely fine, and you should continue using it if you like the product. La Roche Posay, Eucerin, Cetaphil and CeraVe also provide good sunscreens that you can explore in the future.\n\nThe witch hazel may or may not help, you can keep using it if you like it. For sebum production control and anti-inflammatory properties you can also try incorporating Niacinamide into your routine, as it's a proven ingredient that can definitely help with the appearence of breakouts and post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation (dark spots) from acne scarring. The Ordinary has a great [Niacinamide 10% + Zinc serum](https://theordinary.com/product/rdn-niacinamide-10pct-zinc-1pct-30ml?redir=1).\n\nAlso, the order in which you apply your products is of utmost importance. There are a lot of sources online where you can find more about this, but generally you should look to apply your products from the thinnest to thickest, starting with your cleansing oil and water-based cleanser, and ending with your sunscreen/moisturizer at PM.\n\nSo, to summarize: definitely look to replace your cleanser, you can improve your PM double-cleanse by replacing your micellar water with a cleansing oil/balm, be careful with your exfoliating acids, look to get rid of fragrance and harsh ingredients in your products by paying close attention to the ingredient list of the products that you're buying and doing research on that (Dr. Dray is board-certified dermatologist that has a YouTube channel, her advice is just pure gold, you can learn a lot from her). Our skin is a living, breathing organ, that is perfectly capable of self-sustaining and protecting itself. Our job is to enhance its mechanisms, and not overwhelm it by using too many products, harsh ingredients and fragrance.\n\nSince you're not dealing with really bad skin concerns, having a really good, gentle double-cleanse, potent moisturizer, SPF 30+ sunscreen, using frangrance-free, non-comedogenic products and mildy exfoliating your skin with a gentle BHA (Salicylic Acid product) should really be all you need to get your skin to a good state. I'm glad you asked for advice, I'm extremely happy that you specificed the products you use, because otherwise I wouldn't have been able to identify some of the mistakes in your skin care (and potentially the biggest), and I hope you'll find my advice helpful.\n\nAll the best!", "created_utc": "1566866192.0", "edited": "1566902504.0", "id": "ey6xfao", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_cvnlwj", "parent_id": "t3_cvnlwj", "score": "3", "subreddit": "SkincareAddicts", "subreddit_id": "t5_37kq2"}, {"author": "Alex4evah", "body": "Actually I like that it's dark but I dislike that there are too many different colors everywhere", "created_utc": "1566841571.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ey5vwyx", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_cvmltk", "parent_id": "t1_ey517ku", "score": "1", "subreddit": "CozyPlaces", "subreddit_id": "t5_34ixl"}, {"author": "Alex4evah", "body": "Happy cake day!", "created_utc": "1566780494.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ey4337d", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_cvckjs", "parent_id": "t1_ey3zu0r", "score": "2", "subreddit": "Showerthoughts", "subreddit_id": "t5_2szyo"}, {"author": "Alex4evah", "body": "I'm really curious what that comment was about", "created_utc": "1566721958.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ey230z0", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_cuxe43", "parent_id": "t1_ey04wxs", "score": "6", "subreddit": "ariheads", "subreddit_id": "t5_i8bq2"}, {"author": "Alex4evah", "body": "The actual place IRL still looks pretty similar, but thanks for pointing that out. https://imgur.com/gallery/QVN3AlU", "created_utc": "1565954262.0", "edited": "1565954645.0", "id": "ex1ruqk", "is_submitter": "True", "link_id": "t3_cqx1pn", "parent_id": "t1_ex0k8ek", "score": "6", "subreddit": "pics", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh0u"}, {"author": "Alex4evah", "body": "Yep!
