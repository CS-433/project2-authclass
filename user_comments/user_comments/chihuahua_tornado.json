I would first search online how to read and write Japanese kana (the non-character writing systems). There are two, hiragana and katakana. Learn both of these and learn the sounds and pronunciation of the language before you do anything else as this will help in the long run. I recommend searching on YouTube \"how to write hiragana\" and watch someone showing you how to write it as the stroke order is important. \"Japanese Calligrapher Takumi\" on YouTube has some brilliant videos.\n\n\n2. I would then find a grammar book just to help you get to grip with the basics of the language (you don't need to learn the whole book). There are some great free resources out there like imabii.net and \"Tae Kim's Grammar Guide\".\n\n\n3. After that I would go on Anki and download a basic vocabulary deck for like 1000 most common words (there's plenty of them) and do that while also consuming lots of Japanese content (whatever you like, can be manga/anime/youtube/drama/novels etc.). The most important thing is to be consistent and to consume as much native content as possible. DO NOT USE ENGLISH SUBTITLES (or whatever you native language is). Don't worry if you only understand 5% of what you consume; it takes a long time.\n\n\n4. Start making your own flashcards from native content. \n\n\n5. Learn keigo (honorific language)\n\n\nAt some point you will need to learn kanji which is a different beast on its own and theres many ways to go about it so a quick Reddit or Google search will help you with that. Also the Japanese language is heavily rooted in culture so learning about the culture and its practices will help you understand more about the language to some extent. \n\n\nThis is just a basic starter guide, Google and /r/LearnJapanese are your friends here for any more information.", "created_utc": "1658390087.0", "edited": "1658390350.0", "id": "ih0vbbc", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_w499fu", "parent_id": "t1_ih0uc0c", "score": "5", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "chihuahua_tornado", "body": "No you cannot learn a language fast.
