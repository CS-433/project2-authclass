I've got Netflix paired with Language Reactor, it just makes things easier...\n\nWhen starting out it's best to pick things that were originally made in your TL so that the dubs and subs match.\n\nFirst, I set Language Reactor to auto pause after every line. That just makes things easier.\n\nThe first time through I try to listen without looking at the subs, and I give myself a few minutes to process. if I understood the audio, I move on.\n\nIf I didn't understand all the audio I replay the line WHILE I read. I want to be able to match what I'm hearing to what I'm reading. \n\nEven if I know what the word should sound like, sometimes the sound is not actually mapped to my brain. So hearing the word as I'm reading it helps.\n\nOnce I have what I'm hearing mapped out to what I'm reading, I replay a few more times without looking at the subtitle, just to make sure I can continue to hear and understand all the separate words and then I move to the next line.\n\nEventually it gets to the point where the brief pause at the end of a line is all the comprehension time I need to understand what I heard. Subtitles are still handy for picking out any new vocabulary, or making sense of things you may have heard wrong.\n\nOnce that starts getting easier, and looking at the subs when you actually understood the whole audio starts to annoy you... you can move to dubbed TV shows.\n\nThe nice things about dubbed TV shows is that the dubs and the subs don't tend to match. \n\nIf you're more attuned to listening at that point that makes trying to read the subs while you're listening VERY annoying. \n\nAnd you should find yourself drifting away from the subtitles. Which are still good to have there, because often (I find) words I don't know, or words I'm hearing wrong, are STILL in the subtitles somewhere. Just not in the same spot as in the dub. So the subtitles are still there for reference.\n\nThe next step from that is toying around with hiding the subtitles. They're there if you need them... you can just mouse over them and they appear... but they're largely hidden.\n\nThat's also a great time to use your shows as passive listening while you're doing something else. Mostly this just keeps you from using auto-pause, and allows you to flex your real-time comprehension abilities.... but also doesn't tie you to that being your whole intention of being there.\n\nI find it just kind of takes the edge off. I'm not expecting myself to catch much of the show, so anything I DO catch on the fly feels good. Sometimes I can also steal glances at the subs and pick up a new word or two.\n\nFrom there, though your understanding won't be perfect, unsubbed media will be more in your reach, and it will be easier to pick out new words and things. \n\nI'm currently at this weird sort of imposter stage, where it feels like I didn't understand much of the words being said, but I got quite a bit more than the gist of what's going on.\n\nThen I just tell myself \"Oh that's just because of the visual aide. I just picked up the dialogue from the context...\"\n\n.... I've then changed the language of whatever I'm watching and found that no, that's not the case.

Like in this case with \u5b50. .... ofc the implication here is I didn't learn those words back-to-back... I learned them separately over time.\n\nSometime WELL after I learned \u606f\u5b50 (musuko) <son>, I learned \u606f (iki) <breath>\n\nOr I learned \u73fe\u308c\u308b (arawareru) <appear> and somewhere in my travels went \"Wait..... isn't that the same kanji as in \u73fe\u4ee3 (gendai) <modern era>\"\n\nUsually if someone brings up \u751f... which has the most readings...

No it's not just you, and it's not that your Japanese is bad per-se. Lucky Star is just going to take a little bit of grinding.

Some kids just absolutely buck any and all attempts to teach them. Even before the school system is in place. Regardless of what kind of household you have them live in.\n\nThat doesn't mean they can't change their mind later. That just means that Elementary, Middle School, and High School you just weren't mentally ready to take on languages. That's fine. People just aren't there sometimes.\n\nI have a 3 year old daughter who speaks some Japanese, she's just REALLY open and interested in language stuff. I've also accidentally taught her sign while trying to teach her sister since her sister is non-verbal.\n\nIt's really nobody's fault you weren't interested. And even though I agree our school system is whack, it's not theirs either. Even if school had been how you idealize it now, your younger self would probably still pushback against language learning.\n\n**SECONDLY**\n\nI disagree with what you say about raising kids. Firstly, childhood is such a short amount of time where you HAVE the freedom to do whatever you want. And past a certain point, teaching a kid to value time like we do as adults just makes life unnecessarily stressful at an early age.\n\nIt also has zero impact on a kid understanding that some things worth doing are hard. My kid who WILL NOT learn a language, comes with me every week for Kendo. It's hard, he's cried, and I've never forced him to go. He could quit anytime. It's been HIS choice. People just have different priorities and different things they feel are worth the time and effort. Even our past and future selves.\n\nI'm sure kid you put a LOT of time, effort, and energy in SOMETHING... even if it was just beating a hard game. That's still discipline and effort. And sometimes VERY unfun... even if it is a game.\n\nGrant past you some compassion and understanding. Past you was just a kid.\n\n**Now here's why it took me 14 years to really learn a language**\n\nRAILROADING\n\nIn middle school I had a couple years of a combination French, German, and Spanish course. I was really excited at first, because I really wanted to learn German. But the class was super railroaded. We worked mostly from paper packets, and none if it was stuff I wanted to say, needed to say, nor that I was particularly interested in.\n\nAll I remember from our German class was looking at a map of Germany and pointing out different aspects and cities on it.\n\nBack at my apartment complex, I had some friends who were really into anime and manga and one of them had a Japanese to English dictionary. I was so excited with the freedom to look up any word I wanted in Japanese that I abandoned railroaded German for the freedom of learning Japanese in whatever order I wanted.\n\nRESOURCES\n\nResources has been a huge plague to my learning process. At first I only had a dictionary and a grammar guide. That gave me, at best, the ability to construct a very small amount of painfully simple sentences, but at worst only gave me a theoretical understanding that I couldn't actually put to use.\n\nThat and I don't particularly understand parts of speech, so anything too technical just went over my head.\n\nOver the YEARS new things have come out, websites, course-like games, then apps, and with each new thing my learning has gotten more efficient, but the problem is the wait in between.\n\nFor instance it took 14 years before I really had access to TL subs. Which means that it took 14 years for me to start working on audio comprehension. It's gone fast since then, but resources or lack thereof can slow you down. Now-a-days new learners have so much more at their disposal, so their learning is going quicker.\n\nLIFE\n\nLife happens. For me, life happened in the form of a 7 year interruption. Both with language learning, and with everything else. My long-term 16 hour/day Japanese habit dissolved. Not that the hours and consistency were doing me a whole lot of good without the tools I needed. But it did set me up with good habits that were easy to pick back up.\n\nEXPECTATIONS\n\nThere are certain expectations we hold when we are learning to speak a language which can set us behind.\n\nFor me those were the ideas that if I just listened enough eventually everything would just click into place, the idea that I could just pick up all new words from context when I only understood 50% or less of what I was reading, and the idea that  if consuming media wasn't as easy as it is in my NL I wasn't ready for it yet.\n\nThese kinds of weird expectations can set us back and stop us from doing what we actually need to do for our level.\n\nMETHOD\n\nAnother piece is method. Which kind of ties into the above. and echoes what you said. Everyone kind of has to figure out what works for them. Language learning isn't 1 size fits all. And we can waste a lot of time in trying to force ourselves into the mold of someone else's success. Or alternatively trying to force ourselves into what we perceive is the mold of someone else's success. \n\nExample: There's a lot of people out there who try to mimic popular immersers' successes... while abandoning the key parts that make it work. People who surround themselves with language 24/7, but never sentence mine or word look up. \n\nOr people who try to do exactly what others have done even though it just doesn't mesh well with how their brain works.\n\nIN CONCLUSION\n\nAll these variables, and more, cause everyone to spend more, or less, time on language learning. And though it's perhaps good to hold ourselves accountable for the things we have control of... we need to understand that some of it was just uncontrollable.\n\nThe state of our younger brains is one of those uncontrollable variables. It's nobody's fault. Not the school system, not our parents', not even our own. It just is.\n\nAnd once you realize that, then you can objectively look at the time it ACTUALLY took you to learn a language (for me that's like 7-ish years to functionality), and to not look at the past with distain.", "created_utc": "1665420425.0", "edited": "False", "id": "irs3kwy", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_xzqmds", "parent_id": "t3_xzqmds", "score": "2", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "BitterBloodedDemon", "body": "I only wanted to be able to listen and speak in Japanese, but I ended up being able to read really well and only gained listening ability 14 years after I started.\n\nNot that it takes everyone, or even the majority that long.

It makes it easy to bridge the gap between known kanji and unknown hanzi even if the two look quite a bit different. \n\nThere's also quite a few cognates, or straight up borrowed words as the case may be, between the languages that will make things easier to learn, such as:\n\n\u53ef\u611b\u3044 = Kawaii = Cute\n\n\u53ef\u7231 = K\u011b'\u00e0i (kind of like \"kuh-eye\") = cute\n\n\u6905\u5b50 = isu = chair\n\n\u6905\u5b50 = Y\u01d0zi (kind of like \"yee-zuh\") = chair\n\n:) So it shouldn't be too terrible of a time for you.\n\nI don't really speak Chinese, but I do know someone fluent in both, and occasionally they mix up words or kanji/hanzi readings.", "created_utc": "1665415042.0", "edited": "False", "id": "irrq6je", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_y0cxsg", "parent_id": "t3_y0cxsg", "score": "4", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "BitterBloodedDemon", "body": "Nintendo games are pretty good to learn with.

Like we wouldn't acknowledge Romanization or other transliteration of any other language as one of their \"writing systems\". This was a pointless point to make.\n\n> They're technically not alphabets, they're...\n\nYes syllabaries. I don't know why every half baked Japanese learner has to harp on this point. To a layperson \"alphabet\" is a good enough way to introduce them to the concept. There's zero need to be that exact on what hiragana and katakana are when just introducing the concept. ... or ever really. I can't think of a single instance where knowing hiragana and katakana are syllabaries has changed a damn thing.\n\nThirdly. YOU TURNED THIS INTO A 30 MINUTE RANT?! NOBODY HAS TIME FOR THIS!

I read and write Japanese every day and I don't even know what those characters are because they don't matter.\n\nSeriously I'm 2 minutes in and so far it just sounds like you're trying to \"well ackshewally\" yourself into some sort of relevance.  You're trying to sound smart and you're more of an authority with your niche information that isn't going to do anything for a beginner... or anyone else on their road to learning either.\n\n> characters don't all have one sound across the board.\n\nThough you do have a point, especially with things like \u306f, \u3092, or the devoicing of vowels... for all intents and purposes the sounds in Japanese ARE pretty consistent. And it is, IMO, not necessarily a requirement, nor a necessity, for a beginner to learn all of the subtle phonetics like the change of the \u3093 sound. These things either fall in place naturally in time... or can be pushed back to a later date. \n\nAgain, these aren't the things you bring up to a fresh faced beginner, and that's why Olly didn't bring them up.\n\n> Oversimplification ... hiragana can be used for names...\n\nof course they can. But this is a brief overview. If someone were to deep dive into anything in this video it would take HOURS UPON HOURS. \":C He didn't list that Hiragana can be used for names...\" boo fucking hoo. Shit.\n\nHonestly I'm surprised you didn't throw in there \"Hiragana and Katakana aren't like upper and lowercase letters at all\" since you've done such a good job of almost purposefully misunderstanding the original video.\n\nThe thing about the texts... again... unreasonable. Yeah guess what, texts aren't all words either. I can answer a text with just \"K\" or an emoji. Should I then say someone is wrong when they explain that sending a text to a friend in English is done with words and sentences?\n\nAnyway, even on 2x speed I only got 4.5 minutes into this ridiculous ass rant of yours. This has been the most asinine, self important video I've seen someone make on Japanese. If anyone's the fool here, it'd be you, man.\n\nMy suggestion? Lighten TF up.

So whenever I tried to read a story or watch a show I couldn't understand much of anything.\n\nI agree with the others here, you're definitely beyond the need for Duolingo.

So. I've done this. I started out with much the same problem. My reading skill was higher than my listening skill, and I could read the subtitles and understand what the character said, but as soon as the subtitles went off so did my listening skill.\n\nActually had the same issue even with English subs. As long as I knew what it was supposed to say, I could pick out the words fine.\n\nWhat I had to do is really go through the shows I was watching line-by-line. That was easy with Netflix and the chrome extension Language Reactor (LR), because I can just set LR to auto-pause after every line and replay lines with a single button press.\n\nSo what I did was I would replay lines until I could match every word I heard, to every word I read.\n\nThen I would replay it a few more times without looking at the subtitles to try and keep the words separated, straight, and try and comprehend them. \n\nOver time I shifted my focus away from the subtitles, and gave my brain a few seconds delay, when the audio auto-paused, to try and figure out what was said.\n\nIf I couldn't figure out what I had heard, I'd go to the subtitles again. Read them, replay the lines with them, and a few more times without looking.\n\nEventually I found that I needed the subtitles less and could comprehend more. Now I mostly leave the subtitles on to pick up words I don't know. \n\nI also, occasionally, like to watch shows that don't have TL subs. So I've been stuck just doing my best. But after exercising WITH subs for a while, I found I could pick out and understand more and more without subtitles at all. \n\nWhen watching without subs I still don't pick up EVERYTHING. There's a lot of words out there I still don't know. But now I get quite a bit more than the gist. \n\nThat being said, I still struggle with things like streamers. Not sure if what they're talking about is just outside my wheelhouse, or if there's something else going on there that makes understanding them difficult. Without subtitles I really can't pinpoint the problem.\n\nOn the other hand, I've watched youtubers in my TL on a 10 minute explanation video about something or other and understood the majority of it fine. \n\nCertainly though, if you're not picking up words you SHOULD know, then I would say the answer is NOT to get rid of the subtitles. But use them to strengthen your listening skills. It's a training wheel that will eventually come off.\n\nTraining wheels.... as opposed to riding a tricycle. Which is what I'd say going straight through in real time and reading subtitles as a thing plays is more akin to.\n\nBy pausing, replaying, listening, and referencing the subtitles, you also will end up picking up the contractions. \n\nPerhaps shadow a little bit as you go. Like a child I tend to only shadow the sentences I think sound particularly neat. But anything helps. \n\nAnother thing that may have helped me, is that I passive listen while I work... and yeah I don't catch the majority of anything... but I catch a few minutes here or there, and occasionally sneak in a word look up (LR has a hover dictionary so it's not hard to sneak a word look up in). And to an extent that has both forced me to rely on my listening skills MORE... while also giving me the chance to quickly reference the subtitles if I didn't catch something.\n\nEventually you can graduate to like... dubbed American shows... where the subtitles and the dubs don't match to varying degrees. (Sometimes you get like ONE good matching sentence). You can still gather the words you don't know... but the difference in the dub and the sub will kind of force you AWAY from the subtitle.\n\nOr it does me anyway. Because hearing something different from what I'm reading is annoying. So I tend to focus on the listening aspect and scan the subtitles for unknown words I'm hearing.\n\nHope that helps a little.", "created_utc": "1665080335.0", "edited": "False", "id": "irb8hua", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_xxa1z6", "parent_id": "t3_xxa1z6", "score": "1", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "BitterBloodedDemon", "body": "MmmMmMmMmmmm not much.

Let me tell you, the knowledge is super shallow.\n\nOn the other end of that spectrum is, like you said, consuming a lot of content. At this juncture, that's what I do, but even though I can understand a lot of what I'm consuming, I still couldn't pass the higher levels of the JLPT.

Now? Ridiculously easy.\n\n**Were there any pains or mental barriers during the process? if so, what were they?**\n\nIn the beginning I just could not internalize them at all. It didn't matter what I did or what method I used. No regular drills, or flash cards, or this chrome extension I had that turned the first letter of every word into Kanji. I don't know how often I saw \"\u8aadead\" but absolutely would have never recognized it if I saw it in any other context.... which I did... regularly. It was so frustrating and upsetting.\n\nThe other thing was, popular sources pushed memorizing ALL the onyomi and kunyomi for each symbol. That just made the whole thing seem even more out of reach for me. That's between 2 and 6 readings per character on average. HOW?! When I couldn't even learn the symbols in the first place?!\n\nIf I had known people push stroke order as one of those things you HAVE to learn when you learn Kanji I think I would have tossed the whole idea out right then and cried. (Before I hear about it... I do know the basic rules of stroke order now...)\n\n**Were there anything that helped the process? What were they?**\n\nRTK (and actually I ended up using Kanji Damage) was the thing that really made the difference for me. Starting with simple kanji and then building up to more complex ones... making stories and mnemonics for their meanings, really went a long way in helping me learn kanji.\n\nI didn't stay on Kanji Damage for very long, once the concept sort of clicked for me I was able to move off of it fairly quickly.\n\nI then started learning Kanji alongside vocabulary, which cut out the middleman of having to learn readings.\n\nI could learn things like:\n\n* Son = Musuko = \u606f\u5b50\n* Chair = Isu = \u6905\u5b50\n* Hat = Boushi = \u5e3d\u5b50\n\nAnd also not really acknowledge that in all 3 of these \u5b50 was making a different sound.\n\n**If you could do it again, what would you change in your process?** \n\nI think I would have pushed to get an RTK book as soon as my cousin showed it to me, as opposed to trying to bulldoze ahead in any other method. It would have made that process go a lot quicker. \n\n**What is your general experience in learning Kanji? (Open question)**\n\nAfter that first hump, kanji has really been smooth going. It takes me several repetitions to learn one, but anymore I just learn it as (Shape) = (Japanese word) = (meaning). It's really smooth going and really easy.\n\nReading in Japanese was something I actively avoided and put off, and now it's my highest skill.

Sometimes I hear a consonant wrong, or an entire syllable wrong, or I split the new word into two because I thought I understood the first part as another word. \n\nSubtitles, even romaji ones, can help in those instances.

So IMO you will have a higher chance of coming in contact with grammar and vocab that you already know.

This makes it less efficient overall review. There's a higher likelihood of reviewing just arbitrary stand alone words, and less chance to review grammar via sentences.\n\nSame with Anki unless you have your own pre-made deck available.\n\nThough, that being said maybe you can find a Genki or Tobira deck on memrise or Anki to review, and that should mitigate some of the aforementioned cons.\n\nOr you could re-read the textbooks you previously learned from, if you have them available.

I would stick to Dogen for anything really PA related (He's more sensible and less obsessive than Matt) but let's pick these apart a bit.\n\n**DOGEN**\n\n* 1) Watch the same film (ideally 12\u4eba\u306e\u512a\u3057\u3044\u65e5\u672c\u4eba\uff09on repeat several times a day.\n\nI tried this... the premise is fine... it just didn't work out for me personally. If you watch a show long enough to memorize all the lines then likely you'll be able to repeat those lines with solid PA.\n\nThat's kind of why I never had trouble correctly pronouncing the PA of \u5b66\u6821.\n\nBut since aging over the age of 4... I just can't watch a movie on repeat that much (I say like I haven't restarted Death Note for the 20th time trying to pick out all the new vocab)\n\n* 2) Record yourself saying part of the dialogue from that film (listen, then repeat afterwards)\n\nYou can also do this WITHOUT using film dialogue... but this kind of exercise will help you pinpoint where you're saying things wrong. This is a perfectly acceptable exercise. It will also help you with speaking in general.\n\n**MATT**\n\n* 1) Find a parent (a set person to imitate), immerse daily (different content each time)\n\nThis is better if you're like me and you just CAN'T watch 1 thing on repeat. \"Finding a parent\" is a long standing method that Matt got from AJATT. The logic is sound. Stick to one actor and focus on/match their speech and you're less likely to be alternating PAs or speech patterns. It will keep you more consistent. \n\nIf you can find a parent you can follow through multiple media sources that is...\n\n> 2) Shadow audiobooks (i.e. speak at the same time).\n\nAgain, this is a long standing method, and not a bad one. My 3 year old daughter has used it pretty consistently throughout her toddler years. She usually shadows TV.... and now she can speak in, largely, full sentences. And she throws in some pretty big words occasionally.\n\nAs a control... her twin sister had a lot of teething pain from 2 to 3, and stopped talking entirely. She understands as much as the talking twin, but she mostly vocalizes in babble, screams, or random sounds. \n\nI remember being 2 and understanding a lot, but the ONE TIME I needed DESPERATELY to get across a thought to my mom I found I didn't have the words for ANYTHING I wanted to say. \n\nSo yeah... parroting... parent, audio book, TV show, or other... is a good way to bring things into active recall, and help anchor down things like PA and cadence.\n\n**Level 4**\n\n> 1) Shadow parent (i.e. speak at the same time) (same speaker, different content each time)\n\nThis is just the above tactics mixed together.\n\n> 2) Read out loud and check for pitch accent\n\nThis is a bit labor intensive... *I* wouldn't do it, but if it helps, and it's not awful to do, it's probably not a bad exercise. (Well I lie... I've actually done this before to random words)\n\n> 3) Record yourself free talking and analyse.\n\nThis is really good speaking practice. [A french version of this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hin1HGhbGdo) is one of my favorite exercise ideas, actually! Pick a story, like from your day, tell it, analyze it for missing words, wrong word usage, bad grammar, etc. Fix it, and tell the story again. Review the recording, repeat. Until you can tell the story with ease. Then tell a new story.\n\n> Does anyone have any recommendations as to which is better?\n\nLike with most things in Japanese, there is no real \"better\" there is just what works best for you.\n\nFor learning PA stuff, I'd stick with Dogen.\n\nFor actual exercises (especially since Dogen pushes active listening vs all else) I'd say any of their recommendations is fine.\n\nIt's all stuff that's going to level up your skills in one area or another. :) It's all cumulative gain.

I literally couldn't understand half of what I was \"reading\", or trying to read, holy shit, I google translated 2/3 sentences because of weird grammar and stupie sentence structure\n\nSo Firstly, the JLPT is not the whole language wrapped up in a nice little learning package. It's what The Japan Foundation thinks you need to know to be functioning and productively fluent.\n\nHand in hand with that is standard coursework. Apps... classes... textbooks. They have ANOTHER idea of what you need to be fluent, and don't include a lot of the stuff on the JLPT.\n\nThen waaaaayyy on the other side of the spectrum you have native media. Which tends to have vocabulary and grammar points that neither coursework nor the JLPT provide. Or they provide them so far in that you've already hit diminishing returns and just aren't picking them up. \n\n> I know about 2000 kanji I'd say at this point but after checking the internet apparently around ~3000 is the amount the average educated japanese person knows. Holy shit. No no no no no. And they are complicated as fuck.\n\nThese numbers are all false goalposts. They're usually \"What does one use on their day to day\" sort of stuff. Which is what makes Slice of Life the easiest genre to start learning. But the average person knows FARRRRR more than 3,000 words and are in contact with them more than these little quantifications would have you believe. Which leads me to this:\n\n> I mostly enjoy fighting series but they're so damn hard with philosophy and attacks and tactics and yoji and proverbs and super casual terms and shit.\n\nI've spent a lot of time in media and have learned it's not about the # of words you've learned. It's about WHAT words you've learned.\n\nWhat I've learned so far gets me through Slice of Life and Pokemon pretty easily (though there's still a fair amount of new words I go through and pick up)... but if I switch from Aggretsuko and Pokemon to say.... Death Note or Carmen Sandiego, I only understand half the show.\n\nThe slice of life half.\n\nThe crime, legal, and geographical jargon throw me for a loop. But largely I can still keep up.\n\nUnless I move on to a high fantasy like The Witcher... the deep rooted political jargon among other things make the show almost impossible to slog through.\n\nThen there's Assassins Creed Black Flag which just leaves me dead in the water with all of it's nautical terms and very specific vocabulary set.\n\n2,000 - 3,000 words can get you through a LOT.... if it's the right 2,000 - 3,000 words...\n\nYour coursework was made to help you get through your day-to-day, not sail the high seas. \n\nSo again, it's never the number, just the content!\n\n> Are ~10-15 hours a week, 1~3 hours daily of immersing and anki really not enough.\n\nWhen I was a teen I did 4-8 hours a day of active study, and up to 16 hours a day with some sort of Japanese going on around me. FOR YEARS.... and I really didn't end up with a lot to show for it.\n\n... well I guess I ended up with theoretical knowledge... whatever didn't fall directly out of my head after I read it or repped it.\n\nI picked back up at the start of Covid, and haven't really had more than an hour, maybe 2 a day to do any Japanese study. But with the tools available now and just looking words up in media as I go, I've made leaps and bounds.\n\nI've made far more progress in 1-2 hours a day (and not even every day) than I did going at it between 4 and 16 hours a day. \n\nSo no, you're doing enough.\n\n> how many more to go to be able to enjoy everything I want in japanese without it feeling like a pain.\n\nSo here's the thing, at this juncture, it's unlikely that the JLPT or other traditional methods are going to get you the vocab you need to work through specific forms of media.\n\nThere are just words on your frequency lists, due to the shows you watch, that aren't on theirs. It's that simple.\n\nIn order to learn those words, you're going to have to look them up as you encounter them.\n\nYou can put them in Anki if you want, that's fine, I don't, but that's just me.\n\nThe good news is every genre, every individual piece of media, down to every arc, chapter, or episode has a finite core vocabulary in it that repeats early and often.\n\nAs you pick up that core vocabulary, your understanding and comprehension speeds are going to get quicker with less and less word look up. I've experienced this firsthand mostly with Pokemon. \n\nThe core vocabulary you pick up from whatever media you focus on is going to then overlap a bit with other pieces in the series, and in the genre. Meaning when you pick up a new thing of the same category, you'll be starting at a higher baseline than you started the first piece.\n\nThere's going to always be a little fall back when you switch media pieces or genres, so be mentally prepared to nearly have to start over again slogging through a piece of media. But it picks up a lot faster than you might expect it to.\n\nMy first week playing through pokemon was a nightmare slog. It took me easily between 2 and 4 hours to get my starter pokemon in Shield. And a couple more to get to the first gym town. But by the gym town I was already reading more than I was looking up.\n\nWhen I switched to Let's Go Pikachu, I started out going about as fast as I had been reading and comprehending when I dropped Shield. I got to the 3rd gym in a couple days of play (so like 4-6 hours maybe).\n\nThen Brilliant Diamond came out and I was chugging along even faster, at arguably almost English reading speed.\n\nThen with the release of Legends Arceus, I've been able to keep pace with my husband easily. I still have word look ups, but they're nowhere near as drastic.\n\nBut again, then I try to play Black Flag and I just get my ass handed back to me. Like I don't know any of the language at all.\n\n> a kid learns a language through constant input throughout the day for like 7-8 years before reaching actual fluency but like, I'm not 3 year old, it should be easier for an adult, right?\n\nNo, it's not. Because that kid gets gradual comprehensive input. Mom and dad start by giving the kid a vocabulary of individual nouns and adjectives they've defined by pointing the items out.\n\nThen gradually they i+1 up to short sentences. Gradually adding words and complexity over the course of YEARS.\n\nAs adults, we don't have access to this gradual system, and we wouldn't have the patience even if we did. Even if you can replicate that system, you'll still hit blind spots, little pockets of stuff you didn't encounter before.... you know like nautical terms T-T.... that are going to throw you back at square 1 for that thing.\n\nAs adults we ALREADY make leaps and bounds of learning progress that children just cannot do in the same amount of time. You've learned more in 2 years than any 2 year old ever could or ever will.\n\nBut no, take it from me, spending your WHOLE DAY in Japanese isn't going to drag you to that level. I mean unless you move to Japan... in which case you're STILL probably going to lean heavily on \"slice of life\" vocabulary and still find yourself short with other genres of media.\n\nYou're just at the tip of the iceburg. That's all. But getting through the rest isn't as hopeless or long haul as it seems.\n\nStick to your current schedule but switch learning tactics. IDK what that looks like for you. For me that was playing games and watching TV and looking up unknown words quickly in my dictionary before moving on. I may have to look up a word 5 or 10 times, but eventually it SRSes itself for me and I remember it.\n\nCurrently I've been keeping notes and trying to look new words up in a monolingual dictionary, and then words I don't know in the definitions in a bilingual dictionary. But that's REALLY labor intensive and I don't do it all the time.\n\nI used to have the same problem as you, I avoided media because I couldn't enjoy it like I did in English... And that seems to be a common hangup. \n\nAs we move into media, and the challenges that native materials bring, we need to remember that we're STILL learning. And while we're still learning media is study material, and study time, not pure entertainment.\n\nOnce that clicks and you find your groove, you'll find yourself enjoying the process more and more. :)", "created_utc": "1662135841.0", "edited": "False", "id": "imtbxde", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_x433x7", "parent_id": "t3_x433x7", "score": "22", "subreddit": "LearnJapanese", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qyls"}, {"author": "BitterBloodedDemon", "body": "Japanese out of convenience.\n\nAnime and manga were super super popular and my neighbors had a Japanese to English dictionary.\n\nFrankly I was just excited to be able to learn a language.

I picked up Duolingo at some point but I already knew a lot of the stuff it was teaching, so in the end it was only really reading practice kind of.\n\nStruggled understanding any media. :/ VERY BAD at listening skills. Understood NO spoken Japanese. I seemed to be lacking the right vocabulary to read anything I had available to read... and I was under that false impression that if I'm not reading like a pro immediately, then it's not time for me to be reading yet. So I really didn't pursue that any further.\n\nOver COVID I finally had enough spoons, and my life was in order enough (despite a full time job, a spouse, and 3 kids) to pick Japanese back up again. So I re-started my studies and my immersion.... which was kind of always going on in the background... I was a hard core AJATTer in high school... but what I took away from AJATT was what I like to call the \"osmosis method\"... so I had good immersion habits, but bad immersion LEARNING methodology.\n\nAnyway, kickstarted that back up... and was frustrated with being too good at traditional learning stuff, but still bad at media, and having my Japanese be good enough to be understood but in the same breath told it was \"strange\".\n\nSo in an effort to fix my Japanese and finally understand SOMETHING I jumped right in and started just looking up everything I didn't know. Words, grammar points, kanji. Whatever. Everything.\n\nFound out they had Japanese subs on Netflix, and started working to correct my listening too. \n\nBecause I have a busy life though, I don't spend near the time on it that I did in high school.\n\nAnymore it's like... some amount of hours passively listening while I work, depending on the day I may sneak in some word look ups, I may just passively listen for 8 hours, or I may throw something long running in English on youtube and just not at all.\n\nAfter work I spend maybe an hour picking apart something. Usually the TV show I was watching while working.\n\nFrom there I have opportunities for bonus studies. My phone is in Japanese... and at this point I've long since looked up the main words I need to get by, but sometimes something comes up. I have some Japanese game apps on my phone for instance. Or sometimes I google things that I know I'll find the best results for in Japanese. Or sometimes I'll not feel like typing and HAVE to tell google my search in Japanese.\n\nMy Nintendo Switch is in Japanese, so if I feel like playing a Switch game, odds are I'm going to also have to do some word look up as I go.\n\nMy Netflix is in Japanese... since mostly I listen to TV while I work, at this point it's just easier to throw a show I was watching in Japanese on as opposed to find something in English I want to watch.\n\nI also follow Japanese youtubers, twitter users, and I hang out here a lot. So I'm near constantly picking up something.\n\nIf I'm bored and I have the capacity for it, I've also been putting something on... a game or w/e, and looking up any new word in a monolingual dictionary.\n\nSometimes I can understand the definition immediately and I'm good to go.... other times I get between 2 and 4 new words from the dictionary definition.

Regardless of whether or not someone studies PA they will pick up at least part of the accent naturally. Studying PA can increase the speed that that happens, though.\n\n> No one would advocate that someone learning French or Spanish speak with an American accent, would they?\n\nAccent study is not a prerequisite for the above languages. Nor for English. :/ Japanese is the odd one out. And mainstream PA study is really new.\n\n> Or that they should speak with a mixture of Canadian and France French or Mexican and Spain Spanish.\n\nA person is going to pick up the accent they are most in contact with. For learners, that's probably hands down going to be the Tokyo Accent. I'd argue any other accent slipping in there is going to be minor and not as jarring as people throwing that comment around would lead you to believe.\n\n>  I think people want to ignore it and downplay its importance because it's hard.\n\nPeople downplay the importance because the importance is WAAAAYYYY overblown, thanks to people like Matt... who also didn't learn PA until the last half decade.\n\nThousands of people have learned Japanese to a functioning high level, with zero problems, and zero accent complaints well before this ever became a mainstream thing. The pushback isn't because it's HARD. The pushback is because there's too much emphasis put on its importance.\n\n> I think it was the Japanese from Zero guy who said he heard the intonation patterns, but thought it was stylistic rather than each word having a set pattern.\n\nBut regardless of whether or not he thought it was a stylistic choice, he still picked it up.\n\nDuring that whole debacle a native Japanese speaker came to JFZ's defense because his accent was a regional one, that he picked up from living in that region. It was \"incorrect\" per the Tokyo Dialect, but perfectly reasonable for the area of Japan he lived in.\n\n> So you wouldn't sound charming like someone speaking English with a French accent\n\nThis is subjective, not objective. No matter what we do or what we try we will forever carry the accents of where we've been. And that's not a bad thing. So long as someone is trying their best, it's not going to be any more grating or annoying than someone foreign speaking your native language.\n\nAnd as far as I've seen, it's only the Japanese learners taking this sentiment to this degree. Where it's perfect accent or nothing.\n\nCompletely the wrong way to go about it, and a surefire way to disappointment when you realize you'll never be perfect at it.\n\nSometimes I can't place accents because they're similar to SEVERAL accents... but that doesn't really make any difference. An American speaking Japanese (with the best accent they can muster) is still going to register as an American type accent. Because people of the same native languages are going to make a lot of the same mistakes.\n\nJapanese is not an exception to language rules.\n\n>  because all your patterns would be native Japanese patterns, just the wrong ones. You would sound like a weird computer generated AI voice.\n\n[Here's Korone (native Japanese) speaking with, and then shortly without, her accent](https://youtu.be/q_-JF2uWias). Arguably, learning and speaking in perfect Tokyo accent can lead to you having a robotic and unnatural sounding voice and cadence. It would be like someone learning English and speaking like a news caster.\n\nWhich I mean... still wouldn't be BAD per-se... different... slightly jarring... probably more-so than just speaking with their natural accent... but it's whatever I guess.\n\n> Another problem is that until you have at least some Japanese under your belt, the explanation of how pitch words will go over your head (for example, you don't know what particles are or verb conjugations, etc.). Which is probably why textbooks used to omit it.\n\nTextbooks used to omit it because like most phonetic studies it wasn't really problematic. It still isn't particularly problematic... Japanese every several years just has one miniscule thing or another that learners want to harp on as a necessity lest you never be understood. \n\nActual textbooks, still aren't teaching PA.\n\n> It seems like it's just like we have to learn the gender of nouns in German or French, you have to learn which of the four pitches each word has.\n\nThis isn't the case. That's what people currently are pushing you to believe, so they can sell you courses... but PA is simply the attempt at generating a native-like accent. Which is not a necessity.\n\nIt's not like learning the genders of nouns in German or French.\n\nIt's like learning perfect native-like German or French phonetics.\n\nIs it nice? Probably... is it necessary? Absolutely not. Do the studies exist? Probably in some poor university basement... yes.\n\nAgain Japanese learners are the only people who push this, like as if Japanese is some magical exception to every other language.

You'll know, from hearing it said often enough, that it's \u306f\u2197\u3057\u2198(particle)\n\nLet's take the BIG BAD for English speakers, Heiban:\n\n\u5b66\u6821 specifically.\n\nI pronounce, and have always pronounced \u5b66\u6821 in heiban, correctly. Because I have heard \u5b66\u6821 said SO MUCH that that's just naturally how I say it.\n\nNow that doesn't work for everything. Just because you hear a word, even a dozen times, said correctly doesn't mean you'll repeat the correct PA. That's why ACTIVE LISTENING is the important thing here.\n\nIn a way, if you're actively listening, you are in fact actively studying PA. \n\nIf you are actively listening with PA you will go back and look up words to double check if you heard the PA correcty. Once you're fairly accurate with that, I'd say you wouldn't have to do it anymore.\n\nThe problems with actively studying PA by say... memorizing the PA for every word you learn... is that is a LOT of information, and a good way to stall out.\n\nIf you're memorizing rules you'll have to try and recall them on the fly, which doesn't tend to work out well in any aspect of Japanese (like verb conjugation) while trying to speak.\n\nAnd language is constantly changing. Some words like \u8d64\u3044 (\u3042\u2197\u304b\u3044) are shifting into nakadaka presently (\u3042\u2197\u304b\u2198\u3044), it's not in the PA dictionaries, but it's happening.\n\nBut most importantly, PA isn't the end of the world. It's the cherry on top of ones learning journey. So what if you have an accent? No matter how hard you drill and study, more than likely you will still say words with the \"wrong\" PA. And that \"wrong\" PA, might be the correct PA in other regions.\n\nIn either case... an accent isn't going to stand between you and being understood. And much of your accent will improve from listening and use regardless of whether or not you study PA. It just speeds up the process.\n\nI've been at this Japanese thing a looooooonnnggg time and this is just the fad of the decade.\n\nIt's not a bad thing to learn, but it's nothing to drag yourself across the coals over.\n\n[Check out Dogen's Patreon!

Babies start out by having objects pointed out to them and named for them. In a way, they are given the definition for a lot of words at the very beginning.\n\nOver time those individual words start being used in short sentences. We call this i+1. As the baby/child grows more words are added, and sentences become more complex, until the child reaches fluency. \n\nWhen starting with a closely related language it's easier to make the jump and learn much of a language from just immersion.

I just kind of go as the wind takes me... but probably easily an hour or two a day... but I do my readings largely through video games. \n\nIt's gone a long way in helping my comprehension of different grammatical structures, and my vocabulary.\n\nFor technique, I try to just dictionary look up words as I go. I don't write anything down unless I'm having a bad retention day. I just try to go. I don't expect to retain much if any of the words I look up, and know I will have to look them up a hand full of times before it sinks in.\n\nI kind of treat a piece of media like its own SRS. \n\nFor grammar I don't know... if I can pinpoint a grammar structure I don't know, then I google search it and read an explanation.\n\nHowever there are several times when I think I know the grammar I'm reading, and I'm just not comprehending a sentence. In which case I'll google translate it and study both the translation and the original sentence to see how the words are interacting with one another. \n\nEither I gain a little bit of understanding in sentence function, or I end up finding the new grammar point I didn't know, and look that up directly after.\n\nFor me, that's done a LOT.\n\nFor selecting things to read: I jump around a LOT. I really only read from video games because even books in my NL put me to sleep anymore. I have 3 kids and a fulltime job so I'm just tired, I need engagement with what I'm doing.\n\nSo it kind of comes down to \"What do I want to play today\" when it comes to reading. I've never really had access to things like graded readers, and have had to trial and error my way through things. Of course, things aimed at kids are easier. Anything even closely related to slice of life is easier. Mario is pretty ok.... but once you get into super specialized topics... like say Assassins Creed Black Flag (so like... pirates and nautical terms) the difficulty scales up tenfold. \n\nYou might REALLY be having an easy time with one thing, and then you switch genres and it's like you never knew any of the language at all.\n\nSo be aware of things like: Crime, Legal, High Fantasy (for the politics you might not realize is in there), Military... categories like that are really going to throw you for a loop and have a LOT of vocabulary you won't know, and won't be able to just pick up.\n\nAs a general rule of thumb, the closer you are to 100% comprehension, the more words you can pick up from context and without lookup.\n\nIntensive reading, especially if you stick to 1 genre, or 1 series, will eventually become extensive reading all on its own.\n\nGenres, series, individual books, and right down to individual chapters all have their own core vocabularies. It's finite, it repeats early and often, AND it carries over.\n\nSo once you get through the first chapter, reading the first chapter again will be much easier. And much of the core vocabulary from chapter 1 will carry into chapter 2.\n\nOnce you get through 1 book, much of that book's core vocabulary is going to carry over into the series.\n\nAnd a lot of the words you learn from even one book in a genre, will carry over to other books of the same genre.\n\nFor me, I can prove this with Pokemon. I started with Shield and only got as far as the first gym town. It took me DAYS, talking to everyone and reading everything.\n\nWhen I put down shield I picked up Let's Go Pikachu. In the same, or even less time... I got from the start of the game, to about the 2nd or 3rd gym, still reading everything.\n\nI wandered off for a while, but 6 months later I picked up Brilliant Diamond, same strategy... by that point I was reading and playing the game at almost English speed.

It was completely different from the other Pokemon games, and by then I had gone through enough games and genres to know that that could put me back at square 1, going REALLY SLOW.\n\nBut to my surprise, despite the differences in the games, missions, and story... there were still A LOT of vocabulary and concepts that carried over, and I was able to easily keep pace with my husband, playing in our NL, even though I still occasionally had to look up words.\n\nI did pick up shield again at some point and found that I was able to pick up the occasional word from just context because I knew all the other words around it.\n\nSo yeah. :) Intensive reading, hopping around, not really worrying about speed or retention.

Are you looking for the lab?\"\n\nThis man lit up like I have NEVER seen someone light up before. He was almost VIBRATING he was so happy.

Otherwise it would be harder to grasp.

Some things can just be set aside for a later date. Skip it and move on.\n\n> I guess I'm in a bit of a beginner's slump, and it's really tough to push forward. I know I will, but it's scary moving on when I don't have a 100% solid understanding of things.\n\nYou have to be able to tolerate some ambiguity. You haven't been at this very long, and there are going to be things that don't click for a while. Sometimes for stupid lengths of time... until one day they just do.\n\n**How did I not feel hopeless**\n\nI started 16 years ago, and back then the timeline we were fed was \"10 years to fluency, at least.\" so I knew I was in for the long haul.\n\nAs time went on more apps and direction became available, which made things easier to learn, and helped me make more progress. But after the first 7 years I ended up on a 7 year hiatus.\n\nAnd at the 14 year mark (the end of my hiatus) I was pretty bummed out that for all my effort, yes I was good at traditional learning materials, and I could follow the barest of directions in Pokemon... but I still couldn't understand any spoken Japanese, nor did I have any real reading comprehension, and ALWAYS the problem seemed to be vocabulary. Not enough vocabulary. And I'd start a new app and study more vocabulary and still be short on vocabulary.\n\nFinally at the start of Covid I got desperate and started looking up everything I didn't know. I would take sentences I didn't understand and throw them in google translate and study the original sentences and the translated ones to try and wrap my head around how words worked together.\n\nBecause sometimes even if I knew the grammar points, and knew all the words, it still didn't make sense.\n\nAfter about 6 months or so all of the things I learned over the first 7 years of my study started falling into place. And new grammar and words were acquired easily (or easier anyway... I forget things A LOT... I'm completely unbothered about the idea of retention. Either I'll get it eventually, or it won't show up enough for me to bother... it's whatever.)\n\nBut the main difference between me muscling my way through, and you muscling your way through, is I spent years and years and years inadvertently repeating the basics over and over and over again.\n\nTextbooks and apps I started frequently would run me through some gambit of the same exact sets of vocabulary words. Though often in different orders.\n\nAnd then work their way through the same exact beginner grammar points.\n\nAnd then feed me words I didn't need that I never picked up, and or a new app would come out. Rinse repeat.\n\nI tried to read grammar books, grammar sites, and grammar blogs to learn new grammar... but none of the grammar points stayed in my head unless I was using them. So I started only referring to grammar guides on an as-needed basis.\n\nPersonally, I'd recommend Duolingo. It teaches you vocabulary to start, then short sentences with that vocabulary, then gradually builds up both vocabulary, and difficulty of sentences as you go.\n\nIf nothing else, it will be a great place for you to rep some super basic information that Genki is trying to teach you.\n\nI don't know how well the two mesh... I've never even glanced at a Genki textbook.... but worst case scenario, you'll end up learning more but different words.\n\nBut at least it's engaging, and kind of gamey... but honestly it did more for me than Anki and Memrise ever did.\n\nBut the biggest thing is... Japanese is in the category of THE HARDEST LANGUAGES for English speakers to learn. You're just a beginner still, there is NO WAY you're going to be able to play games in Japanese yet... or much else.\n\nYou've really gotta build yourself a solid foundation of grammar and vocabulary first. And even then it's going to be an uphill climb for a bit.\n\nBe easy on yourself. Things are easier now than when I started but this is still hard as hell! You have no linguistic footholds to hold on to to help you pick up the language faster. It shouldn't end up taking you as long as it took me... but know that you're in for the long haul.\n\nAnd ignore the others pointing out how behind you are... they're generally full of shit, or otherwise don't really know what they're talking about. There are so many variables out there that slow people down or put them behind. Some of us took gap years, didn't or don't have the right tools, have one hurdle or another that's especially hard for us, start with a native language that puts us at a disadvantage.

Conjugation sucks......with only a little trouble as long as it\u2019s not super advanced (cause grammar, particles, conjugation..)\n\nWhen I started trying to read things like Twitter posts, Harry Potter, and even Pokemon I remember being very frustrated and dismayed.\n\nI could navigate even longer sentences in traditional learning settings FINE... but it seemed to all go out the window with native material. Often I found myself knowing all the words in a sentence, but not being able to figure it out.\n\nLONG SENTENCES WERE THE WORST! They were IMPOSSIBLE. I tried googling how to learn to read long sentences... or find lessons that would help me learn to read them... no luck.\n\nIDK if you remember Kindergarten... or first grade... around there... where reading was still new. I remember long sentences would sometimes not make sense, and if I had to read out loud I wouldn't understand what I was reading.\n\nThere's a reason we all had to take comprehension tests in school. It's HARD. It's a skill itself that needs built.\n\nSo back to Japanese.\n\nThe first helpful piece of advice I found was \"read the sentence backwards\" Start at the period, and work word-by-word back to the beginning of the sentence. The sentence will often make more sense as you've put half of it back into an English order. Verb, Object, Subject. You just put the subject back in place and voila!\n\nWorks a good chunk of the time... still didn't help with super long sentences.\n\nAt the start, for me... with short and long sentences... I started having to employ Google Translate. But I wouldn't just throw it in and go \"Oh, this sentence means X\".... because firstly... Google Translate isn't always on the nose anyway... and secondly that's not learning.\n\nSame reason why pop-up dictionaries weren't teaching me anything for a long time. Just getting the answer doesn't teach you the thing.\n\nSo I would study the original sentence, and what Google came up with, and try to reason out how and why the words in the original sentence worked together the way they did to make Google's sentence.\n\nIf a robot... who uses mathematical like functions to translate... can figure this out and spit out a translation without thinking... I can certainly do it! (I also write functions in Excel so it does most of my work for me... cuz I'm lazy... so translation technology doesn't awe me... I know how basic it is)\n\nAnything I can't sort out myself I throw into a google search. I either look for a Maggie Sensei article (it's got very layman's friendly explanations, and lots of examples), JapaneseTest4You (basic straight to the point explanations with lots of examples), or I put in \"(word/grammar) \u610f\u5473 \u82f1\u8a9e\" Because I'm sure some poor Japanese person learning English is having the same struggle.\n\nPast that I just kept at it. I set low expectations, that it would be a miserable grind and not click for a LONG TIME (I started 16 years ago and have about 7 years cumulative study on board so it's already taken A LONG TIME...To be fair there were a lot less resources when I started though... and I was 13...).\n\nTo my surprise things fell into place a lot quicker than I expected.\n\nFor Pokemon Shield I was reading more than I was looking up by the first gym town... which is about where I got tired of playing.\n\nShortly after I picked up Let's Go Pikachu, and made it to the 3rd gym in the time it took me to get to the 1st in Shield.\n\nMonths later when I picked up Brilliant Diamond I was playing at almost English reading speed with still several word look ups, but much much fewer.\n\nI've been able to keep pace with my husband on Legends Arceus.\n\nAt like, the 6 month mark of heavily studying everything I consumed in Japanese I started to be able to follow large chunks of Inuyasha, which doesn't have Japanese subtitles available. \n\nNow I can follow along with longer sentences, and most of what I'm doing is learning vocabulary, fine tuning my listening, and trying to accumulate enough to start speaking again. .... which would go even BETTER if I just did some speaking exercises like recording myself telling stories, correcting, recording again, rinse repeat.\n\nTBH: You're on the right track. Keep going! Check out Refold... I didn't think at this stage Refold had anything to teach me. And I had already been burned by AJATT (even if that was half my own fault), but Stage 2 and 3 stuff had a LOT of useful information that I'm starting to employ.\n\nLike I'm taking baby steps into mono-lingual dictionaries... because it turns out I have the vocabulary now to read some definitions without looking up any words.\n\n.... generally though I still have to look up words... so I'm toying around with looking up the initial new word in a monolingual dictionary... and new words from the definition in a bilingual dictionary. \n\nAnd if I'm not feeling that much effort I just use a bilingual dictionary.\n\nDon't feel confined to one thing. The more you force yourself to do something hard, the less likely you will be to do it.\n\nWhen I really started to get into learning from immersion, as previously stated, I only had the stamina for maybe an hour of Pokemon... and less with a novel.\n\nOnce I got tired I quit for the day.\n\nI would take weekends off.\n\nI have a husband and 3 kids and no one here speaks Japanese so I can't really go for 5+ hours even if I wanted to... but I've still made a TON of progress in a short amount of time.\n\nAnd eventually my tolerance built up. So now I can passively listen to a show at work (and sneak in some word look ups. ;D Language Reactor's pop up dictionary is a nice feature), spend an hour after work picking apart the show I'm watching. Go downstairs and wrangle children, cook dinner, clean, whatever. Chill with a game in Japanese, maybe some Luigi's Mansion or whatever. Scroll facebook or twitter and be forced to read the occasional kanji, and maybe work on playing through the visual novel on my phone for like 30 mins or so, without really being tired.

I had many years of false starts doing both of those things.\n\nChanging language settings, blindly navigating, not learning any words, getting frustrated, and switching back to English.\n\nOr changing language settings and just blindly navigating/listening and picking up nothing.\n\nImmersing, in stuff I knew... in stuff I didn't know... trying really hard to listen and pay attention and learn... and picking up nothing.\n\nListening to audio and not even picking up words I knew.\n\nReading and hoping that these jumbles of sounds, kanji I knew, and sentences of words I knew would eventually form coherent thoughts... to no avail.\n\nThe above isn't actually immersion learning... it's trying to learn via Osmosis. Which just can't be done with Japanese.\n\n**Getting past the hump for me**\n\nNow this isn't a one size fits all, it's just what I found that worked for me. And I hope other people post what they did. You kind of have to discover what you need for yourself...\n\nLike I cannot STAND Anki, it does nothing for me, and I will not use it. Some people CANNOT STAND this method, it doesn't work for them, and they will not do it. That's fine.\n\nSo in late 2019 I couldn't understand any spoken Japanese.\n\nI had no comprehension of the one novel I own.\n\nAnd as far as games go, I could only get the bare bones physical directions, or the gist of specific tasks, in Pokemon.\n\nAs far as traditional learning material though, I could navigate most things pretty easily as long as it was text based and not listening.\n\nSo at the start of COVID I decided to take a plunge back into the immersion habits I started in High School. But some point after I started I became DESPERATE to produce native sentences. I could write... but I found I was just writing English thoughts in Japanese words.\n\nSo for the umpteenth time in my life I changed my phone into Japanese.\n\nThis time though, I took a day or so, and I looked up ALL the common words I was coming in contact with:\n\n\u5199\u771f\u3001\u6295\u7a3f\u3001\u8a2d\u5b9a\u3001\u6b8b\u308b\u3001\u9001\u308b... I still have a list somewhere but it's A LOT of words. Just stuff I needed to basically navigate some apps and settings functions.\n\nTo be fair, I still can't read EVERYTHING in my phone. And if I have an error that keeps popping up, I do have to switch back to figure out what's going on.\n\nBut otherwise my phone has been in Japanese for 2 years, going on 3 now, and I still take the time to look up new words.\n\nSecondly, in much the same vein. I got back into Pokemon. With Pokemon Shield, I started a new game and looked up EVERY WORD I didn't know!\n\nIt was excruciatingly slow. I only had the stamina to chip away at it for an hour at a time. I was writing down every sentence with even a single word I didn't know, and I was talking to everyone and everything I could as I went. It took me DAYS to get my starter pokemon. And a couple of more days to get to the first Gym town... but by the time I got there I was reading more than I was looking up.\n\n.... also by the time I got there I had gone from writing down every sentence with a new word, to just writing down the new word, to just looking up the word and continuing on.\n\nI stopped worrying about retention. All media has a core overarching core vocabulary. Every chapter or episode also has its own core vocabulary. Things in the same genre, often, have a lot of the same core vocabulary. It's all very finite, and it repeats early and often.\n\nThe goal is to learn the core vocabulary, which still leaves A LOT of words that won't be learned. But as long as the core vocabulary largely is picked up I don't care. The other words will often be important in other genres or other shows. I'll learn them eventually.\n\nFor core vocabulary, I let my media do the SRS for me. I often have to look up a word several times before I learn it, it's just part of the process for me. Past that, in my eyes, either a word repeats enough that I learn it, or it wasn't an important word. But since I can't peg what words are going to be core vocab or not, and I'm not willing to sit in ambiguity until I go \"I've seen this word 8 times, I wonder what it means\" or put the whole script in a program that will pick out common words for me, or search for vocab decks for that media online... I just look up everything and let the rest fall by the wayside.\n\n**listening**\n\nListening was THE HARDEST THING to fix for me, and I want you to know that working on listening skills can, and should, be done in baby steps.\n\nSo to start with:\n\n> Is watching dramas helpful? They speak so much more slowly and clearly from the natives on YouTube, so I can\u2019t tell if it\u2019s a wasted effort.\n\nDramas are fine. They speak clearly, but they still naturally slur their words together, and you get more natural emotes.\n\nAnime is generally the starting point because the language in anime is the clearest. It's kind of the nature of animation. But it's also more emoted..... that's... the nature of animation. But that doesn't mean it's BAD. The core language is still the same, even if later you have to kick off over-emoting, speaking TOO clearly, and fix your formality. For listening, it's your first baby step.\n\nDrama is the next baby-step, for the reasons I initially listed.\n\nThe final baby step is things like youtube... and also bear in mind, if you watch Hololive like I do, the girls all come from different regions, and the different words or different accents can throw you off, even if you can't perceive the difference.\n\nIt's kind of like how I would consistently miss the word \"katana\" being spoken because it's not \"kah-taah-naah\" like we lengthen it in English, it's more of a \"kaah-tahnah\"... the cadence is off so I was missing it.\n\nYou can work on this though, likely the same way I worked on my listening skills in general, by employing CC subtitles.\n\nT-T If the subtitles are auto-generated though... you're likely only going to get half of it generated correctly... if even that... so it's going to take some sleuthing... \n\nI'm not QUITE there... I can watch some things without subs at all. I can follow dubbed American shows if I have subs to help me pick out unknown words... but I'm still VERY LOST with things like Hololive. (Though Japanese creators who make language content for other natives or for English speakers.... as in they have English subs available... which generally I have off anyway... I can follow OK... but I kind of know the vocabulary those things use)\n\nSo again... Dramas are fine... baby steps! You're just not at youtube level yet.

This is shit advice and needless to say i didn't learn anything.\n\nThat is shit advice. That's advice from either people who are intermediate to advanced... or people who think immersion is learning through osmosis.\n\nWhen I changed my phone into Japanese I made a long list of words I kept coming in contact with, and buttons I used on social media... even if I could navigate without reading I made sure to look up EVERYTHING. \n\nThere's still a lot I don't know... and if I get any serious error I have to swap back to English and wait for the error to pop back up again... but for the most part I can navigate the majority of everything I need to read in my phone because I took the time to look up the words.\n\n> and after 5 months I learned how to understand and speack Spanish.\n\nBecause you have a couple of things going for you:\n\n* Shared words with English\n* Closer grammar structure\n* People who ALSO speak English\n* Probably more context clues\n* Engagement\n\nEngagement goes a long way into language learning. Which is kind of what Anki is supposed to replicate. But Anki doesn't really work for me either. So I feel you on that front.\n\n> First off, forget the immersion method. It doesn't help you if your a beginner and your just going to quit.\n\nAgreed. \n\nAlso I think a lot of us have two problems... 1. We don't remember being a beginner... and 2. We get the idea that if we had just done what's working for us NOW when we started, we would be even further now.\n\nSo then we just say \"Read more\" \"Listen more\"... when it's more like \"Study more. Pick up more vocabulary. Do your reps. Do an app. Do a textbook.....and when you BABY STEP into immersion... study study study!\" Immersion does nothing if you don't know the grammar, don't know the words, and can't keep up.\n\nBut it does WONDERS when you can follow along, have a handful of words here and there to look up, and know enough to even pick up the occasional thing from context.\n\n> \"if your going to have someone correct it make it in Japanese\" this is stupid.\n\nThat IS stupid. Like I remember seeing people (like Matt) push monolingual dictionaries. \"Get off of Bilingual dictionaries ASAP and get onto a monolingual dictionary! It's better!\"\n\nIt was TOO MUCH! There was NO WAY! It's just one of those pieces of advice I found pre-reddit that just drove me to tears.\n\nI only recently started poking around a monolingual dictionary. But I have the foundation and vocabulary now to actually read through and understand some definitions without looking up anything.\n\nAnd I have the spoons and energy to look up the handful of words I don't know. \n\nBut I absolutely WOULD NOT recommend that for a beginner.\n\n> 3rd Genki sucks! I don't know why it's so praised.\n\nI feel this way about Anki and Tae Kim.\n\nWhich brings me to the next point. Over my 16 years I've found it's all about experimentation. I really don't take people's advice as perfect truth, and I haven't for a long time.\n\nIf someone recommends me something, though, I'll try it!\n\nWhen I started there was really only textbooks and physical dictionaries. Internet resources were scant and in their baby stages. \n\nI started on Anki because Anki was the only app that existed. I followed AJATT because it was the only thing out there that acted like a learning guide. (and I picked up those bad immersion ideas you mentioned... which also yielded me no progress).\n\nEventually I learned about iKnow, an app kind of like memrise, and I jumped to that and found I liked it MUCH BETTER than Anki. So I dropped Anki.\n\nI left my textbook for Tae Kim, I left Tae Kim for Maggie Sensei. I alternate between Maggie Sensei and JapaneseTest4You.\n\nIf there's something new that comes out within an area that I need help with... I try it. If it helps me more, I change to it... if it sucks I go back to the last thing that worked. Sometimes that does mean that you spend a lot of time on something that yields you little to no results until you find something that DOES... and that sucks... but it's not always avoidable.\n\n> I have learned more by downloading Pimsler, HT Lite and watching beginner Japanese videos on YouTube. Genki isn't fun at all and by using HT Lite and YouTube videos you don't have to memorize nearly as many words just the ones you struggle with.\n\nSo this is where I try to go around and tell people not to put down others' learning methods and push the \"right ones\". Because like... Anki doesn't work for me... Memrise isn't much better.... but I gained A LOT from Duolingo. And there's a lot in Duolingo that I think is more beneficial, logical, and just all around better than the alternatives. \n\nOr like right now, I just tank my way through media looking up everything I don't know. I've got the stamina and the patience for it. But I know a lot of people can't do that.\n\nPersonally I tried Pimsleur... and left more confused than I started.\n\nBUT EVERYONE HAS THEIR OWN LEARNING STYLE!!\n\nThe importance of experimentation is knowing YOUR learning style. \n\nAnd I guess that's kind of the thing... is you can't just look at the advice here and think the person on the other end is giving you an objective piece of advice.\n\nYou have to look at things like... what level is the OP receiving the advice? Potentially, what level is the person giving the advice? What do I know about MY receptiveness to things similar to that method?\n\nYou've now kind of taken that first step.\n\nGenki-like textbooks? Not for you.\n\nAudio/video learning is working well for you. Interaction is working well for you. You will want to seek out more sources and advice that teaches in those methods. \n\nIf you hang out on the boards (which I recommend you do), you want to find people who struggle the same way you have and recommend them try what you do.\n\nSometimes you'll help someone find a method that works better for them.\n\nSometimes you'll have given them something WORSE.\n\nBut I find it makes a major difference for the few people I can help, so I ask you please stick around and try to help others like you!\n\n> basic text book stuff, which by the way teaches dated stuff.\n\nIt also teaches quite wrong stuff. But it's still important wrong stuff. :) Japanese is so far from English that the best way to teach it at the very very start is to make it as close to English as possible and then correct as one goes forward.\n\nBut then you end up with people like me, that stuck with traditional study for TOO LONG and ended up speaking English in Japanese words.\n\nNow the reason why I immerse in so much media... is I struggle being social in general... it just takes a lot of energy I don't have... and I struggle at making conversation out of nothing... So it's hard to keep up even with English speaking friends...but I need to correct my phrasing still! So I read, and I watch TV, and I play games. \n\nOf course, this means that when someone needs help in this area, that's what I push, because that's what I know.\n\nI'm sorry that a lot of the tips haven't helped you. A lot of the tips and advice in here wouldn't have helped me either. Or didn't. But it helps some people!\n\nI throw my voice into the mix too on the off chance it's what someone needs. And sometimes it's not and it's also \"bad advice\"... \n\nBut that's the thing... is language learning isn't a one size fits all. It's not a perfect science. If it were there wouldn't be so many different kinds of resources. There would be 1 method and that's what everyone would do.\n\nThere are some methods more popular than others, sure! But everything you come in contact with needs cherry picked! \n\nA big piece of advice back when I started was \"ONLY WATCH THE NEWS! That's the only REAL Japanese! Don't watch Anime. Don't watch Dramas. Don't read novels. Don't play games. ONLY WATCH THE NEWS AND READ NEWS ARTICLES! That's the only REAL JAPANESE.\"\n\nAnd I tried.\n\nAnd I cried... a lot. Because I couldn't do it. And I couldn't keep up... and it was just awful and boring and hard.\n\nSo I quit, and I went back to the \"bad\" stuff. Because I could kind of keep up with the bad stuff. I could understand the occasional thing in the bad stuff. I could gain SOMETHING from the bad stuff.\n\nAnd that kind of became the norm in every aspect of my learning.\n\nYou HAD to learn Onyomi and Kunyomi for EVERY KANJI! You had to learn the Kanji individually! By themselves!\n\nI couldn't. I tried. I tried REALLY HARD! It was too much. So I abandoned it. \n\nI learned Kanji as \"spelling\" for words... I would know \u606f\u5b50 (musuko) <son>\u3001\u6905\u5b50 (isu) <chair>\u3001\u5e3d\u5b50 (boushi) <hat>, and not even realize that \u5b50 was in all of them, let alone making a different sound, even though I had no problem reading the words.\n\nNow that's more the norm for learners.\n\nI don't think we promote enough the idea of learning yourself. We just push the popular thing, maybe the thing we used, and treat it like fact. We need to do better at letting newbies know that they need to try different things. LOTS OF DIFFERENT THINGS, and get to know how they learn best. That not everything will work for them, but that that doesn't mean that those other methods are wrong either. We need to teach learners to be self aware as to how they learn best, as much as we need to help provide them direction.", "created_utc": "1660505426.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ikagm7z", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_wnwlzu", "parent_id": "t3_wnwlzu", "score": "4", "subreddit": "LearnJapanese", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qyls"}, {"author": "BitterBloodedDemon", "body": "I wasn't even into Anime or Manga when I started, actually.\n\nIn middle school I just wanted to learn a language, and I wasn't even aware that the anime I watched on TV (Pokemon, Digimon, Inuyasha, Dragon Ball Z, Hamtaro...) were even foreign. LOL.\n\nAt the time I had been taking combination French, Spanish, and German classes in middle school and I was so frustrated at it. It was so railroaded, and I didn't feel like I was learning anything. The only thing I distinctly remember from those classes was looking at a German map on a work-packet and going over geography. \n\nI wasn't learning anything I thought was \"useful\" and I wasn't learning any words I wanted to know.

And I was so excited at being able to look up ANY WORD I WANTED! And it could BE BOUGHT AT THE BOOK STORE!! So I got one for myself! And a little pocket grammar guide, and a phrase book, and went to town on it.\n\nShortly after I discovered the language section in my middle school library... which had, among other things, a German picture dictionary. \n\nKind of kicked myself in the ass that I could have started learning the things I wanted to learn in German all along.... but I had already monetarily invested into Japanese... and now here we are.", "created_utc": "1660502102.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ika8mvn", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_wo9xpz", "parent_id": "t3_wo9xpz", "score": "5", "subreddit": "LearnJapanese", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qyls"}, {"author": "BitterBloodedDemon", "body": "Oh, no.

I used Anki A LOT while Anki was the only thing available, and I learned from it.... but other methods would and have had better results for me.\n\nAnd part of the problem was actually a little bit of:\n\n> you will memorize the order of appareance and one will trigger the next, and this is not language.\n\nFor sentence cards I'd instantly know the English word... but not the Japanese one. \n\nAs soon as I would see the first word on the card I knew the answer on the back, even though I didn't know even half the words.\n\n> About your list of words and phrases, there is also research that proves it worse than randomized flashcards, you will memorize the order of appareance and one will trigger the next\n\nI think there's some confusion here. Duo is still randomized, but it teaches concepts in a comprehensive input sort of manner. But not in a patterned memorizable order.\n\nLike you're taught a hand full of basic nouns.\n\nThose are added to in a +1 fashion with small words, forming small sentences, which teach you patterns like:\n\nThis is ___\n\nThat is ___\n\n___ and ___\n\nWhile it cycles through the words they already taught you.\n\nThen the next set of lessons builds vocabulary and complexity.\n\nYou'll see the same patterns, but new words.\n\nThen in further lessons the sentences are expanded:\n\n(Noun) and (noun) (verb) (object)\n\nFor instance or\n\nThat (noun) from (place) was (adjective).\n\nIt's not in any set order, it's just building up vocabulary and concepts brick by brick. Sentences are randomized, words you know will reappear and disappear as you progress, and new words are added.\n\nDuo doesn't have an SRS system built in though. You can 100% complete a lesson skill in 1 sitting... but it doesn't do much good that way.\n\nOne should complete a round of the lesson, move on to different lessons, then periodically backtrack and do the lesson again. With the length of time between returns getting longer until the lesson is complete. \n\nBy the time the lesson is complete (5 rounds), the lessons following it should be at like 4 rounds, more recent ones at 3, more more recent ones at 2, with a handful of lessons at 1.\n\nFor MY PERSONAL LISTS....

But I have heard Son Goku, and the characterization was BLATANTLY obvious.\n\nWould I talk like Son Goku? LOL NO! But is it grammatically correct Japanese with words (though maybe in different forms) that I will hear elsewhere? Yes!\n\n> If you need an example of that, Kotaro lives alone mentions it in the anime. The child has been learning japanese speeches and way of talking through animations for specific reasons and resulting in him talking in a very bizarre old fashioned way :) which everyone comments on it.\n\nYes I'm aware of this. Again, I expect someone delving this far into Japanese to already be knee deep into grammar guides, text books, and learning apps. \n\nHearing Kotaro speak should be setting off little bells. And likely the first bell to be set off is \"what the hell is he saying?\" If researching Kotaro's dialogue doesn't tip them off, the visual of Kotaro watching an old timey Samurai cartoon doesn't tip them off, and the parts where they outright bring it up don't tip them off, then there was no hope for them anyway.\n\n> In fact, it\u2019s the reason why in some countries like Morroco, children do not always understand what is being said on TV cartoons because they speak dialect at home and outside, but the cartoon is in Modern Standard Arabic which is the one you learn at school.\n\nThis is a different matter entirely. In the opposite direction even. \n\nIn anime and such I see a lot of different dialects. And IMO even if I don't use it, it's important to learn it, as you don't know when it will come up.\n\nBut as for this comment, that's kind of a strawman. Those shows are still made BY natives FOR natives even I'd it doesn't cross dialectical lines. Likewise I would not be able to understand a show that is heavily Australian or produced in some areas of Scotland or even certain parts of England. \n\nThat still doesn't make it suddenly NOT English, or not made for natives. It just makes the target audience NOT that Dialect.\n\nActually my hometown area has a Dialect of Spanish not found anywhere else. Among other things words like Mariposa are unknown. My Grandma, a speaker of Chilean Castillano, is largely not understood there, and even closer related Mexican Spanish isn't totally understood there. So likely Spanish TV? Not for them either. But we still wouldn't tell people NOT to watch Spanish TV just because these other dialects exist.\n\n> Not like you can suddenly see someone with an Hiroshima dialect and accent. Everyone is talking in the Paris accent. Not the Southern, not the northern. Never. And never in slang or dialect either.\n\nI touched on this a little bit ago but that's not necessarily a bad thing. Unless you consider other dialects (that you are likely to meet someone using) are \"bad Japanese\". \n\nI argue it's actually GOOD to know parts of different dialects, different accents, and most certainly slang, even if you don't use it yourself. Especially for Pitch Accent learners, who may get thrown for a loops if they encounter a word said in a different PA because that person doesn't originally speak \u6771\u4eac\u5f01. Or like me not catching \u304b\u305f\u306aeven in \u6771\u4eac\u5f01 because I was more used to hearing the word in English cadence.\n\nAs for slang, there was a good handful I had to learn on the fly chatting with natives in a chatroom.  It's good to have it in your wheelhouse. \n\n> That\u2019s why you can\u2019t expect people, depending from where they come from, to think that anime wouldn\u2019t be the proper way to speak.\n\nTrue, but I also know they can't learn from Anime alone. There's... well there's 3 ways this could end.\n\n1. OP could quit Japanese early and be left with ONLY what they can pick up from Anime, which will be very little, not particularly useful, and characterized... but OP will likely never use it outside of trying to impress friends.\n\n2. OP will notice a difference between speech while learning and will start to recognize dialect, politeness, exaggeration, etc. And have the sense to still be able to learn useful Japanese from it (ie: sentence structure and vocabulary) while NOT picking up the undesired aspects \n\n3. OP will at some point have a mixture of 1 and 2, where some of 1 comes out in daily interaction... in which case I suspect those aspects will be trained out over time.\n\nGenerally I find super beginners to be the ones most guilty of saying things like \u304a\u524d in their attempts at talking in Japanese... and either they quit, or they learn better, or it's trained out, because I've never seen someone in a later stage of Japanese misusing those kinds of things.\n\n> Not that this was in question here at all.\n\nNo, no, you're right. And I agreed with everything you said in relation to the actual subtitles. I'm just tired of these Japanese learning taboos. They were EVERYWHERE 15 years ago, and thankfully are becoming less and less prevalent as people realize that they're largely BS.\n\nGranted I realize all those taboos came from a good place.

I would not assert a timeline as \"standard\" or \"the norm\" even if it's based on my personal experience. \n\nWas I trying? Not particularly, but I stated that.\n\nOther people? You don't know their circumstances. They may be lacking the right tool, the time, the energy... you don't know. All \"If you can't learn it in a weekend or less you're not making any effort\" does is chase people off.\n\nSo, now... let me restate what I was doing with Korean... AGAIN.\n\nI was trying to see, if like Chinese, it had enough similarity to Japanese that I could pick up on it near instantaneously.\n\nI had no intention of learning Hangul. I was forced to go through the hangul lessons anyway. Keeping tiny details apart and creating rules for different facing T or TT shapes was not really on my to do list. I thought, worst case, I could treat a full Hangul word (or word fragment... however it works) like I do Kanji, and memorize the silhouette to a sound.\n\nThat didn't work.\n\nIf I wanted to learn Korean, honestly, I would have invested more time in Korean, and whether it took me 3 hours, 3 days, or 3 months I would have learned Hangul.\n\nI was just tooling around.\n\nAnd all of this **still has nothing to do with my comment to OP** which was \"That depends.... what is the end goal of writing Japanese in Hangul for? Why would you need that?\" Which would totally change my genuine answer to OP.\n\n\"Japanese would be so much easier and logical if it were written in an alphabet like Hangul.\" -- Japanese has an 'alphabet' so to speak. And often you find that alphabet used over the Kanji to aide with reading. So changing the writing system to Hangul is needless. Though you do have to learn another alphabet. :(\n\n\"Kanji is difficult and outdated!\" -- I get this a lot, it's very scary at first. I avoided reading because of it for like 2 or 3 years. You can avoid it.... even completely if you do it right. Take your time. :)\n\n\"It would be easier/more interesting to learn Japanese phonetics via Korean with Hangul characters. Kind of a Hangul romaji.\" -- That's very interesting!! I wonder if that exists!! Pretty sure they do that with katakana sometimes when it's only important to read the phonetics of the word and not just learn English letters! I wonder what that would look like.\n\nSo yeah.

The best way to find those words, is to look them up as you go. As you pick up more and more of those core words, your reading and understanding ability will go up, and your number of word look ups will go down, as you progress through the book.\n\nBy the end of the book, theoretically (and if my experiments with the Pokemon Series have meant anything) you will be reading the majority of the book with little issues... and looking up only the occasional word if you need any at all.\n\nFrom there if you wish to read through it a 2nd time, it will be easier and you'll get more understanding from the first part of the book than you did during your first read through.\n\nYou will also likely pick up more vocabulary.\n\nAnd so on. \n\nDefinitely worth the effort. \n\nThe bad news is, once you switch off the Quran to another source of media you're going to be hit with a drastic decrease in comprehension ability and likely find yourself in a vocabulary deficit again.\n\nBecause different media has different necessary vocabulary sets.\n\nIf you stick to historic and or religious text probably a good amount of the vocabulary will carry over, but expect yourself to be... not quite back at square one... but definitely having to repeat the process again. \n\nAs you do this over and over and over you'll find the amount of vocabulary you're lacking from one media/genre jump to the other will also decrease over time. So think of it not as starting over from scratch ever, but a steady incline of an increasing amount of new knowledge, and a decreasing amount of unknowns. :) Language is finite!!

Duolingo IMO is really good at progressing in a gradual manner. The nature of it is very much in the vein of comprehensive input, and honestly... having started before apps existed... that's something I haven't seen in any of the apps that have come out before it.\n\nThe other thing is, regardless of whether you use Duolingo, or a different traditional learning resource, the language is altered and worded to best initiate an English speaker.\n\nThat is to say at best... it's not totally natural Japanese... and at worst, it's English spoken in Japanese words.\n\n**BUT THAT'S OK** because otherwise it would be much harder for us to grasp the language at all. It's AAAALLLLLLL baby steps. But this is part of the reason why even if you're good at traditional learning materials and know your stuff backwards, forwards, and inside out, you may still come to a dead standstill with native media.\n\nAlso I totally feel you on that \"I can't concentrate on other apps\" thing. Memrise, despite having different activities to do... still feels and acts too much like a flashcard system.\n\nAnd that's not even totally the issue, I think part of it is how often these things just don't build up. They give you a new word, and an example sentence full of words you don't know and expect that to do something for you.\n\nANYWAY. Vocabulary issues -- I can relate to this. Once I got into the later leaves on Duolingo I stopped being able to retain new words. Largely, I think, because even if they're common I just didn't have the need for them really. I don't remember the word for laundry for instance. Or one of the later classroom bubbles with \"document\" \"essay\" etc. It just doesn't apply to me.\n\nRegardless of what we consciously think, I think our brain categorizes things as useful or not. And if your brain is like \"I use the word 'laundry' like never...\" regardless of whether or not you consciously are like \"Laundry! That's a needed word! I do laundry every day! Laundry is a large part of my life, so it's an important word\" You're not going to remember it.\n\nI HATE Anki... I've never been good at flash cards... and I like the idea of Memrise... I've tried to make my own decks in Memrise... I've tried really hard to use Memrise... memrise and I just don't mesh. It is what it is. I've been at this a long time... sometimes like relationships you're just not compatible with these things.\n\nYou sound like you're at a half-boiled potato point... too good for apps... but not good enough for media... and the first thing that comes to mind is \"I need more vocabulary\" and you try to learn more vocabulary, fail, hop apps, try again, fail, hop apps, learn some words, go back to media, find you're lacking in vocabulary...\n\nI've found that vocabulary in learning resources, and vocabulary to consume media, DON'T overlap very well.\n\nThere are tens of thousands of words out there!! The odds are the ones you need are at like... the bottom of the 6K word pile if they're there at all. :C Boo.\n\nWhich also causes the feeling like no matter how many words you learn, you still haven't learned enough.\n\nYou've learned plenty.... for the topic of your study... which is traditional study. When changing genres you're always going to encounter a whole lexicon of new words. You're just changing genres. You've mastered your first one! Congrats!\n\nBut it also leaves you with the feeling that you should be this proficient in the rest. \n\n> but after months and months of doing the very best I can still not being able to understand anything besides a word every 2 sentences in level 0 children's books is somewhat demotivating.\n\nSo this is... probably less that you don't have the vocabulary... and more that you don't have the comprehension skills.\n\n\"But I'm really good at understanding the example sentences in my coursework\" \n\nThat's because it's very close to natural Japanese... but it's not. It's hard to explain, because even I can't pinpoint how, or why, or where exactly coursework Japanese and natural Japanese differ... but they are far enough apart that going from coursework to even children's level 0 graded readers are going to kick your ass for a minute.\n\nSo when I jumped in... and pick whatever you want... I started with posts on Hellotalk, twitter feeds, and Nintendo Switch games... and no matter how short the sentence, and regardless of whether or not I knew ALL the words... I just could not understand it.\n\n**So here's some options**\n\n**first** Practice reading sentences backwards... starting at the end of a sentence and working to the front.\n\nThis is some advice I found somewhere that helped quite a bit at the beginning. It puts part of the sentence \"in the right order\" for English speakers.\n\nEventually you won't need to do that but it's a good starting practice.\n\n**secondly** utilize Google Translate (or DeepL, whichever). Throw the sentence in... and then STUDY both sentences.\n\nSee if you can work out how the words work together to get from the original sentence to the google translation.\n\nGT isn't perfect, but it's often close enough to push you in the right direction. Especially at this stage.\n\nBuilding up reading comprehension is a toughie, that's why we all have reading classes and comprehension tests in school. \n\n**third** on the vocabulary aspect, I've had a lot of luck with looking up every word I don't know. (and every grammar point, but mostly I just need words). I don't tend to remember them the first time I look them up.\nOr the second.\nOr the third.\nOr the fourth.\nBut eventually I see the most common words enough to learn them.\nI don't take notes (well unless I'm having a bad retention day... I'll wrote or type memorize... but I never go back to them), I don't make flash cards... I just look up the words as quickly as I can, and I continue on.\n\nThe only real caveat to that is, I feel like pop-up dictionaries are a little too easy... there's a step lacking in there with a pop-up which makes it too easy to look up the word, and too easy to forget it... maybe because with Takoboto or Jisho I actually have to put the kanji I don't know together, or otherwise type in the hiragana word. It makes it sort of like wrote memorizing.\n\nLike I was saying though, I've had a lot of luck learning and retaining a LOT of new words by just looking them up as I consume media. It isn't instantaneous, but the added context and the perceived NEED to know even more obscure words makes it easier.\n\nLet's take \u69d8\u5b50. In the memrise deck this word VEXED ME SO BAD. Saw it hundreds of times NEVER GOT IT. Then I played through Pokemon. It's a word used when your pokemon evolves... Saw it once, never forgot it again.\n\nSo in media, each genre, each episode, and each individual piece of media comes with a core vocabulary. Things in the same genre will overlap some vocab, things in general will overlap some vocab a little. But they ALL come with their own specific core vocabulary.\n\nThat vocabulary will repeat early, and it will repeat often. Those are the words you're really going to gain by going through and looking up all the words you don't know. Everything else (and that's A LOT of words BTW) aren't going to be as necessary and you should expect to forget them totally. But they aren't the most important words anyway.\n\nYou should still look up everything as you go, or most everything, so you can follow the story (it's OK to still have some ambiguity as long as you get the gist), but don't expect to retain any words that don't repeat a TON. They don't matter. You'll probably learn them in some other piece of media.\n\n**finally** Every time you change media, or change genre, your proficiency is going to fall back some amount, because you've moved on to something new.\n\nWith traditionally learned words you're most prepared to consume slice of life stuff first.\n\nBe aware that adding in ANY specialty, no matter how slight, is going to throw you for a loop. \n\nCarmen Sandiego is a kid's show... but it is a crime show, and talks a lot about geography... and those two things will really screw you up. You don't appreciate what children know until you try to watch a child's show.\n\nSo if you're struggling ask yourself \"What themes are in here?\" I thought I was doing well with Death Note for a while, and then I noticed I would go from understanding it well, to understanding NONE OF IT AT ALL. It was really upsetting to suddenly have my whole language ability drop out from under me. (at the time I was listening with my tablet screen down while I worked at the office pre-covid)... so then at home I started watching... and I realized my language ability was dropping at parts where the cops were involved or Light was talking about legal things.\n\nSo yeah. Bear that in mind, try those out. DO NOT BURN YOURSELF OUT!! If you can only do this stuff for 30 minutes, do it for 30 minutes. If you can only do it for an hour, do it for an hour. If you need to skip days, skip days. Eventually your tolerance, your skill, and your stamina will improve.\n\nAnd most importantly, be kind to yourself! You haven't hit a wall, it just takes a different approach to get over this hill.\n\nGood luck!

I'm taking Cornell Method notes. I'll write down the sentence (I think I'll stick to things with multiple words I don't know so I'm not writing down EVERYTHING).

Especially due to my mindset on immersion and what immersion was.\n\nSo firstly: I wasn't looking up anything I didn't understand. So what I understood was what I learned from traditional study, and I didn't pick up anything new. \n\nI didn't understand my TL when spoken, so the hundreds and thousands of hours I put in on listening immersion was completely useless, until I got access to TL subs.\n\nMy reading ability was the only thing really keeping me afloat, but see the thing about that is.... even though I had a decent vocabulary, a foundation in grammar, and language courses and apps were easy for me... learning material actually differs quite a bit from native media.\n\nBasically making it so, no matter how good you are, when you drive into immersion you're comprehension is going to be awful, and your vocabulary lacking.\n\nProbably from A1 onward I had been toying around with immersion off and on pretty consistently with no gains from it. \n\nThis was because I expected to learn these things from osmosis, just listening/reading/whatever until it magically clicked. But it doesn't work like that.\n\nAnd the stuff I was immersing in wasn't comprehensible input.

Looking up words. Writing down sentences.

But somehow the focus always felt like it leaned heavy on the usefulness of immersion, rather than what you had to do with all that immersion.\n\nI knew a lot of people then, and see them quite a bit in the boards now, who took that to be the case too.\n\nBut there's a difference between learning via immersion, and learning via osmosis.\n\nI didn't really get deep into Matt's content... I've seen some of his videos, but I was never on MIA, and I really never got into refold... but I assume it's much the same problem.\n\nThe emphasis is on immersion, and less so what needs to be done WITH that immersion. Though I do know Matt, also, endorses a lot of Anki and sentence mining.\n\nAnd both parties have since watered down the idea to a sort of \"Learn while sitting on your couch DOING NOTHING\" (or at least that's Khatz's current tagline). Which just further reinforces the idea of learning via osmosis... which isn't possible (with most languages)\n\nThe other problem I think exists here, especially with Khatz, but probably with both, is they don't remember the beginning stages. Or even some of the early intermediate ones. They seem to be jumping off what they're either doing in the moment, or the last thing they remember doing. Which is helpful for people at around that stage... but can throw beginners off entirely.\n\nI say this from experience, because when beginners ask \"How do I get started?\" \"What do I do?\" I don't really remember what I did, and I have to stop myself from defaulting to what I'm doing now, or pushing what I'm doing now as an option to them too early.\n\nI DO learn from Immersion now, but having toyed around with languages I'm less proficient in (and closer to my own), I find that my process with Japanese does not work on other languages (say German) with as much ease.\n\nPicking through a TV show in German has been nigh impossible. I've had to switch to Duolingo, which feels too easy (I rarely have to look at words, and I can just listen and understand really), but it's building a foundation that I can't just blindly build by immersing immediately.\n\nCan someone learn from primarily immersion? Possibly. I wouldn't recommend it from my own experiences. But theoretically you can as long as you're looking up everything you don't know. Personally, I'd start by building a traditionally learned foundation and then go from there.\n\nI KNOW that's how Matt started, was with an academic foundation, NOT from immersion.

Sometimes I feel it would be interesting information to have now... but I'm so disorganized with learning that IDK how I would have ever kept track. At this point IDK how I would ever count them all.\n\n> How important is counting words for you?\n\nIt's not, because it holds no real bearing to fluency. I have to know at least 3K words, and I can follow a slice of life TV show just fine, but put on a crime show, or a military show, or a high fantasy and I'm totally lost. :/ Not really fluent to me.\n\n> How much time do you spend making statistics and looking at them?\n\nI feel like the proof is in the pudding. I'm more interested in seeing concrete results in the moment than I am projecting how far I have left to go, or seeing my progress. \n\nStatistics can work for motivation at the start. \"I've learned X amount, it will take me possibly this long to get to Y goal!\" \n\nI know when I started using media to learn from I was wrote memorizing all my words, and at the end of the month I looked to see how many of them I had fully learned... but I haven't really done that since. I mean which is more exciting \"I learned 60 words this month!\" or \"I watched this episode last month and understood NONE of it, now I understand 75%!\"\n\n> Should we care about numbers when it comes to language learning?\n\nNo. As previously stated, it's less the numbers, and more what you need the words for.\n\n3K words learned from traditional resources cannot get me through an episode of Dare Devil, or Carmen Sandiego, or Assassin's Creed Black Flag, because they're the wrong 3K words.\n\nIf I gain 3K words from AC Black Flag, I'll be great for sailing, sea battle, and some merchanting... but I'll be useless on the street.\n\n3K words from The Witcher? I'll be able to talk some magic, some politics, and be ready to start my job slaying monsters, and some high profile people... but the small talk will have to be very niche...\n\n3K from Dare Devil or Carmen Sandiego and I'll be ready for the bar exam or to be a school geography teacher (or a world renowned thief), but I won't be able to function at a bank, or ask for things in a grocery store.\n\nIt's not the quantity, it's the substance.

NOPE... nothin.\n\n> I've tried Yotsubato, but found the adult conversations just overwhelming.\n\nI find this to be the case with a lot of things. It's a process. I consider the easier stuff as kind of a break between combing through the harder things. Some days I want less effort and more passive, so I'll put on something like Inuyasha. And if I'm really up for the grind, I'll pick through The Witcher. (Last I checked it took me 5 hours to pick through a 1 hour episode) OOF.\n\n> And I've set myself to rewatch Yuru Camp S2 this summer, without subtitles. Gotta say, the first episode left me displeased, but as you said, I probably need to lower my expectations.\n\nI've always had listening issues with Japanese, and it's been hard for me to pick apart words I'm hearing, and subtitles have been a godsend. I replay lines until I can hear all the words without having to look at the subs. But that's just what I had to do to improve my listening, not everyone has to do that.\n\n> Unfortunately, I have hard to using video games as learning material.

Chinese characters largely, are a 1 character per-word sort of deal. (That's not.... totally true... but we're just going to start with that idea)\n\nKanji have a phonetic list, which is probably where some of the confusion comes from. They've got Onyomi for compounds and Kunyomi when alone. But you can't just grab a kanji with the sound you need and slap it into place. \n\nWords are \"spelled\" a certain way. Like you can't spell Colonel as \"kernel\" just because it sounds that way. or \"through\" as \"threw\", so you can't just use one kanji over the other because it has the sound you need.\n\nFor pretty much all cases, in order to read, or use, a word correctly you just have to know the word.\n\nPast a certain point there is no guessing a reading... and likewise past a certain point there is no guessing what kanji you need to make a word.\n\nSo you just have to kind of learn:\n\n\u732b = \u306d\u3053 (neko) = cat\n\n\u606f = \u3044\u304d (iki) = breath\n\n\u5b50 = \u3053 (ko) = child\n\n\u606f\u5b50 = \u3080\u3059\u3053 (musuko) = son\n\n\u6905\u5b50 = \u3044\u3059 (isu) = chair\n\n\u5e3d\u5b50 = \u307c\u3046\u3057 (boushi) = hat\n\nand so on.\n\nNo chart (except for hiragana and katakana, there's a chart for those), the Kanji you just have to learn as you go.\n\nAlternatively, you can start with Wanikani (free up to level 4), RTK, or Kanji Damage (totally free), which may help you wrap your head around the concept.", "created_utc": "1659974787.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ijggbeq", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_wj6hdg", "parent_id": "t3_wj6hdg", "score": "2", "subreddit": "LearnJapanese", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qyls"}, {"author": "BitterBloodedDemon", "body": "Well... you can compare your skills to the [CEFR proficiency chart](https://www.coe.int/en/web/common-european-framework-reference-languages/table-1-cefr-3.3-common-reference-levels-global-scale)\n\nOr you can take a JLPT test.\n\nOr you can avoid self assessing at all and just provide examples of what you do.... there's a lot of \"intermediate\" or \"Self-assessed N3\"s out there who are neither of those things.", "created_utc": "1659973674.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ijgdfam", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_wjbv4m", "parent_id": "t3_wjbv4m", "score": "10", "subreddit": "LearnJapanese", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qyls"}, {"author": "BitterBloodedDemon", "body": "Mmmhmm. Yup. Did that.\n\nWhen I started doing this it was with Pokemon Shield. I played for 1-2 hours at a time, and it took me DAYS to get my starter pokemon.\n\nI was writing down every sentence that even had 1 word I didn't know.\n\nI was having to use google translate and grammar guides to help me decipher sentences. I can't have been doing much more than you in the same amount of time. And I was insistent on talking to everyone and looking at everything.\n\nI definitely didn't push it, once I was tired with it, I stopped for the day.\n\nBut also, I went into it with EXTREMELY low expectations. I told myself that likely, even playing the game every day, it would take me a solid year or more to get through it. I set myself up to deal with 5-6 sentences an hour, with no hope of it getting any faster. \n\nThe usual first gym town, town,  is where you sign up for the pokemon gym challenge. By the time I got there I was reading, not very fast, but at a comfortable speed. And I was reading far more than I was looking up things.\n\nAnd then my interests waned on Pokemon Shield. I then started Pokemon Let's Go Pikachu, expecting the same experience as Pokemon Shield, and it was MUCH FASTER. I got Pikachu same day, and at least got as far as the first gym town, still talking to everyone. I played through to the 2nd or so before I lost interest.\n\n6 months later Brilliant Diamond came out. When I started it I was reading through at roughly English playthrough speed with fairly few word lookups. I got to about the 3rd Gym before Legends Arceus came out.\n\nFor Legends Arceus I was expecting the worst. I got so fast with the other games because they all share a core vocabulary, because they all have the same core game. Legends Arceus wasn't too bad though, I was able to keep up with my husband who was playing in English.\n\nThe bad news is, everything kind of resets when you move on to a new piece of media or a different game. You carry over more and more new words, but depending on what things you get into there may not be a lot of overlap.\n\nFrom Pokemon, the Mario series isn't too bad. Legend of Zelda is tolerable, though more difficult. But Assassin's Creed Black Flag drug me back to 5-6 sentences an hour.\n\nSame with TV shows. I'm very used to working through 15 mins of a show in a half hour or more. That becomes more or less depending on the genre.\n\nWhich brings me to genre!\n\nSlice of Life has the most words related to things traditional study methods teach. It's the easiest to break through with.\n\nSo like... Good Morning Call, Aggretsuko, Ouran High School Host Club...\n\nBut once you get into specialty genres, and sometimes they're sneaky, the difficulty jumps WAY up.\n\nSo like, in no particular order:\n\n* Crime: Death Note, Carmen Sandiego, Dare Devil\n* Fantasy: Castlevania, Fairy Tail, One Piece (probably the nautical words for me)\n* Military: Attack on Titan, Resident Evil, Gundam\n* High Fantasy/political: The Witcher, The Dark Crystal\n\nHalf the time you'll be able to follow just fine, the other half it's like \"WTF? Did I just forget the whole language?\" I found that with Death Note mostly, then I put together it was all the police scenes that were tripping me up.\n\nSome things run a fine line between Slice of Life and a Specialty Genre, and/or are just really good about providing visual cues with their jargon words.\n\nSo Inuyasha is surprisingly easy for a fantasy/shounen. And Kakegurui is really good about explaining games and terminology with visuals, so it's easier to pick up a lot of the gambling specific words.\n\nSorry that was a lot. The point is, it's hard at the very start, but every piece of media has a core vocabulary that repeats early and often. So as you continue, you will find yourself having to look up words less and less. Once you change media, your progress will do a soft reset. Not all the way back to when you first started with your first piece of media, but you still have a whole new core vocab to work through. The difficulty and amount of word lookups will also fluctuate depending on what genre you're consuming. Even in that regard, you will likely find yourself having an easier time with one specialty genre over the other.

And that something is probably the areas in which she still sucks. Some of which might be easier to hide than others. People like this like to use the illusion of fluency to their advantage.\n\nWhat you're doing is fine, and you've only been at this a YEAR!!\n\nIt doesn't matter what language it is, no matter what anyone has to say on the matter, it takes a long time to build up and round out your skills.\n\nMy native language is English, and I still remember the struggle of learning English!! At 2 I could understand most things, and I don't remember really having to talk much. I was a quiet kid. Then one day we were watching a movie at my cousin's house and I was DESPERATE to tell my mom to get me a copy before the movie was over and changed.\n\nProblem was... I didn't remember the word for \"movie\" \"cartoon\" \"show\" \"video\" \"TV\" or ANY WORD I could possibly use to convey the message. I was frustrated, I was panicky, I sat and paid VERY CLOSE ATTENTION to the show until I could pick up ANY IDENTIFIERS to get my point across (because apparently I forgot the word for dog too). I then ran to my mom and went \"Mama! Quinten (my cousin) Fifi, pluto!\" and pointed at the TV. Thankfully she understood after a minute.\n\nThe point is, language is hard. Having comprehension doesn't guarantee speech. It takes a while to solidify sentence structure and verb conjugations into one's head. That's why we all talk in broken words to start, and work to short sentences, and then bigger ones. \n\nYou've gotta talk, and parrot sentences, to be able to connect what you can understand to what you can say.

Causing people to gold gild their leaves all at once and not make the maximum gains from it.\n\nOr alternatively, jump straight to the word box and immediately be able to tell what the answer is without having actually understood the sentence.\n\nOtherwise it's a perfectly viable app. If anything, find yourself a good grammar source, a dictionary, and maybe try to pick through some easy French media. Games, books, TV shows, whatever (for TV shows DO use French subs, try to match what you're hearing to what you're reading, look up new words)\n\nIt will help it all come together.\n\nI feel like there's been less hostility to Duolingo over the years.

I tried flashcards, I tried a plugin that changed the first letter of every word to Kanji, I tried just muscling through, and I didn't learn ANY Kanji.\n\nIt was the RTK/Wanikani method that started to allow kanji to click for me.

Resources up to now, especially for self-taught people, make things like reading and writing easy goals to achieve. Those skills aren't really invasive, and are super easy to train and practice either on our phones, or at work, without disturbing anyone else.\n\nListening is then the hardest, because firstly... have you tried to find comprehensive input?! A lot of us just throw ourselves at high level things (and yes even children's shows can count as high level things) and hope for the best. And if you haven't developed the skill to even separate words, WHEW.\n\nAnd a lot of people don't really know how to get past that. Most of the advice is \"Just keep going! It will click eventually!\" and it just doesn't.\n\nThen speaking. I suspect some beginners or even early intermediates are probably happy with their speaking ability, until they want to express a complex thought, or discover that they've been speaking unnaturally for a long time.\n\nThat can be really hard to fix, especially if you haven't been really intaking media... either because you can't understand what's spoken, or you can't read as fast or as fluidly as you want.\n\nBut even if you CAN read fast and fluidly, and you DO understand what you're hearing, if you haven't been parroting, or practicing speaking in any way, you're still going to find yourself drawing a blank when you go to speak.\n\nSpeech IMO is the easiest one to not level up. People are often too embarrassed to speak, or don't have anyone to speak to, or both. It's just so easy to avoid, and so, so easy to fall behind on.\n\nVocabulary is next, because we're ALWAYS lacking vocabulary it feels like. Even if you're doing good with traditional learning materials, as soon as you pick up a piece of media you're SWAMPED with all the words you don't know.\n\nSo what's the first reaction? \"Oh well I need to go back to studying.\" And it becomes a never ending cycle because what media prioritizes, and what learning materials prioritize are two separate vocabulary lists. The worst part is, no matter how far you go into traditional learning there will ALWAYS be that vocabulary deficit when you move to media. You'll hit diminishing returns and come to a complete learning standstill before you ever know all the words you need to move through media.\n\nSo it leaves people with this constant idea that they're struggling with vocabulary. They're not. They just learned a different set. Or they're trying to learn words without enough context for it to stick. Learning words isolated is a good way to hit that diminishing returns wall and just stay there. Those words just will not stick.\n\nThings got a lot better for me when I just took the plunge and started looking up everything I didn't understand in media.\n\nFinally we have grammar. Grammar is pretty easy to pick up on, there's usually a lot of explanation out there. Beginners may feel like they're struggling because they read a grammar point and then can't remember it after. It kind of goes like learning individual vocabulary words does. You learn it isolated, you don't use it, you forget it. Like everything else, it's better solidified through use.\n\nIt's just that with both grammar and vocabulary, no matter whether you prioritize reading, listening, or just traditional study methods, you're going to have to use them so eventually you learn them.\n\nEverything else is just a matter of the path of least resistance.

There will likely be words you don't know, or skills you need to build up like listening or reading. But sure:\n\nPersonally I watch a lot of Netflix Originals, so a lot of those don't have matching subs...\n\n* Good Morning Call - Jdrama\n* Kake Gurui - Jdrama (not the anime)\n\nI normally push people away from things with niche vocabularies... like Military, Politics (High Fantasy), Crime shows, and anything dubbed in Japanese because the subtitles won't match... but you might try:\n\n* The new Resident Evil series\n* BBC's Dracula\n* Squid Game\n\nI wouldn't be too worried about exaggeration or lack thereof. Language is language is language is language. So exaggerated or not it all goes into helping you with sentence structure and comprehension. A cursory knowledge of formality levels helps with the rest of the \"bad\" things that anime will teach you.\n\nAnd even then, in real life application you'll find those bad habits will be washed away sooner than later.\n\n(as a matter of fact... I kind of went the opposite... I was really formal from traditionally learning for a long time... and then chatrooms and media taught me things like \u3063\u3066 in place of \u306f and how to talk informally). As a bonus animated things, by nature, have to be well enunciated. :) So there's no struggle in picking apart words. \n\nJ-Dramas are good for learning how to pick apart slurred words in everyday spoken speech. You also get the benefit of seeing natural gestures and things you may not see in Anime. But it's not going to destroy you either way.\n\nMy thing has always been understanding the language and picking up natural phrasing and sentence structure... and less about what is or is not exaggerated (I've grown up with cartoons I think I can differentiate a bit) and naturally slurred speech... you know things I could always fine tune later... so that segways me into the next part:\n\nDubbed shows - Still good for phrasing, grammar structure, and comprehension. They're localized by Japanese people for Japanese people so it's gotta be correct. The only potential downside really is that the speech itself has the hills and valleys of English in the dubbing. But to me it's still one of those minor things that I'd either A. have to work on regardless as a native English speaker, or B. is a lesser problem I can fine tune as a later date and won't hinder my communication anyway. :/ That and you don't get native Japanese gestures and things, but eh.\n\n:) So personally, I'd just go with anything and everything. Some things will work out and be easy. Others will require more effort, word look ups, etc. Some just won't work out at all.

You're more likely to use the same words/phrases in daily life.\n2. There's less niche vocabulary.\n\nCrime shows (legal jargon), Military shows (military jargon), and High Fantasy (political jargon) I'd stay away from unless you have the patience and confidence to look up every other word for a while. \n\nExpect a lot of word look up regardless of what you do. There's a lot of words that are essential to your preferred kind of media that just aren't going to pop up in any course or class setting. \n\nThe ratio of word lookups in slice of life and E rated games are going to be less, and more easy to keep up with, than other genres.

I'll just look it up again next time I need it, and if I need it enough times I'll end up learning it at some point.\n\nBooks, even in my NL put me to sleep anymore... so most of my reading comes from video games.

I also have a 9 year old son, it looks like his story will also play a part in this.\n\n**Preface**\n\nSo, it looks like you kind of missed the window where we naturally baby-talk to our kids. If you're anything like me, you might be speaking to them at the level they would be speaking French. They're not going to pick up that way, they've been thrown into advanced French for them... and it's frustrating to say the least.\n\nIt's not a matter of their brain \"clicking over\", it's a matter of, they didn't get the beginner lessons we give infants to toddlers.\n\n**My Son**\n\nI tried to teach my son Japanese while he was tiny, but I didn't have a lot of knowledge myself, so I couldn't do much helping. Instead I believed that children worked like little sponges, and if I just created an immersion environment things would be OK.\n\nI played Japanese TV around the clock, because I thought that was enough audio and visual cues, and anything I could say in Japanese I did.\n\nMuch like your 2 year old, my then 2 year old son would also noticeably tantrum when I spoke Japanese.\n\nWhen he was 3 I gave up. He never made any progress, never picked up any words, never anything.\n\n**The Verbal Baby**\n\nWhen my twin daughters were born, (my son was 6), I was still desperate to fix my Japanese speaking. I figured teaching my daughters Japanese was as much a loss as it was teaching my son, so I didn't really entertain the thought.\n\nBUT, I paid really close attention to what I naturally did while speaking to my girls. How at the start I kept everything at simple words with visual cues. Then as they aged to super short sentences, and so on.\n\nWhen they were about 2, I decided to try again to teach my kids Japanese. I felt like I had learned enough watching them pick up English, that I could apply it to learning a 2nd language.\n\nSo I started with colors. My daughter had colorful lego bricks she would bring to me and have me recite her colors, so I started reciting them in Japanese.\n\nI have a pack of playing cards on my desk, and I started going through the numbers with her in Japanese.\n\nJust kind of baby step things.\n\nI'll hold up an item, and say its name in Japanese.\n\nGradually (when I remember, the hardest part is remembering) I've worked in basic sentences and short narrations of what I'm doing.\n\nIt's worked!! .... kind of... (again consistency is key, and it can be hard to remember in a monolingual household).\n\nNow, if my daughter hears Japanese playing, or hears me speaking Japanese, she'll stop calling me \"mama\" and start calling me \"okaasama\".\n\n\"Okaasama\" is also generally the cue that she's about to bring me things she wants named in Japanese.\n\nWe went through colors yesterday. She understands \"nan iro?\" <what color?> and will usually give me English answers...\n\nEXCEPT FOR BLUE!! Yesterday we were doing colors:\n\n\"Nan iro? -holds up yellow-\"\n\n\"Yellow\"\n\n\"Nan iro? -holds up orange-\"\n\n\"Orange!\"\n\n\"Nan iro? -holds up blue-\"\n\n\"Owl!\"\n\nMe: ..... Owl?! ....... oh AO!! (Japanese for blue)\n\nShe's also jabbed me in the eye and said \"Meh\", which is Japanese for \"eye\".\n\nIt's a very slow process, you have to get in the mindset that they're babies. And even babier babies than they are now.\n\nStart small, with nouns. Speak mostly English, but replace one word with French. Make sure to point it out first.\n\nOr just completely babify your language again. As 1 to 2 word as possible, with lots of gestures.\n\n**You're not going to visibly see progress for a while**\n\nSo don't panic!!\n\nI remember when I was 2, in a monolingual English household, I once had to convey a message to my mom. I REALLY wanted a copy of my cousin's Disney movie.\n\nBut even though I understood English well (it was my ONLY language), I found that I didn't remember ANY of the words I needed to convey the thought. \n\nIt's going to be a LOT of repetition before they understand and say anything back.\n\nDo the occasional toddler exercise with colors or shapes or numbers... keep things to 1 word at the start. Just show the color and say it.\n\nAs time progresses you can start quizzing them with the shortest version of \"what color?\" you can muster, and after a pause saying the color.\n\nOr if they say the color in English, then follow it up with the French.\n\nSee if you can get them to say single words back to you after you say them.\n\nI've narrated brushing teeth:\n\n\"Ok! Let's brush teeth! Look (holds up tooth brush) ha-burashi! Ha-burashi! (starts brushing teeth) Ha migakisuru. Ha migakisuru.\"\n\nOr after I put them in bed, on my way out the door, I'll tell them \"Oyasumi\" <good night>.\n\nThose little things will start building up and you can get more complex over time.

No odd sounds, no real changing sounds, only some devoicing.\n\n*KANJI*\n\nKnowing how to read Japanese kanji, can help you recognize and perhaps learn Chinese Hanzi. However a lot of kanji and Hanzi don't share the same meaning, usage, or even form.\n\nA lot of Kanji is traditional, whereas Mandarin largely uses simplified. Some Kanji have been simplified differently than their Chinese counterparts as well.\n\nSo whereas it can potentially give you a leg up in learning Hanzi, it would be just as easy using Hanzi knowledge to learn Kanji.\n\n*ONYOMI AND KUNYOMI*\n\nMost people actually don't go about learning onyomi and kunyomi for each kanji. Kanji can have as little as 2 readings, and as many as 6. And even if you learn them, there's virtually zero way you can apply that to reading Chinese.\n\nLet's take the character \u5b50. Onyomi are \u30b7\u3001\u30b9\u3001\u30c4 (shi, su, tsu)\n\nIn Chinese it only has one sound \"zi\"\n\n\u6905\u5b50  Japanese: Isu   Chinese: y\u01d0zi\n\n\u5e3d\u5b50  Japanese: Boushi  Chinese: M\u00e0ozi\n\nAt the end of the day, it's like learning Spanish or German from English. Yes we share the same letters, but not always the same sounds. And yes we share some words, but not the majority. So it helps... but not really.\n\n**KOREAN**\n\n*PHONETICS*\n\nKorean probably has the next easiest set of phonetics. But having gone over some Korean, from a Japanese speaking standpoint, there's a lot of sounds I'm just not picking up. Or that are really complicated to me.\n\nKorean doesn't really carry tones, and though it (like Japanese) evolved many words from Chinese, the phonetics of Korean will not help you with Chinese.\n\n*ALPHABET*\n\nKorean probably has the simplest writing system out of all of these. But it doesn't carry over from one language to another.\n\n*GRAMMAR*\n\nThis is an SOV language like Japanese, and it also contains particles. Learning Japanese first could help you quicker grasp the concept of Korean grammar.\n\nLikewise Korean grammar can help you quicker grasp the concept of Japanese grammar.\n\nReally doesn't matter which you go with.\n\n**MANDARIN**\n\n*TONES*\n\nMandarin has 4 tones, compared to Cantonese's 9+.\n\nPretty sure that makes Mandarin, hands down, the easier of the two to learn tones for.\n\nBesides there being more Mandarin resources than Cantonese ones anyway.\n\n*HANZI*\n\nMandarin has simplified Hanzi. That's less strokes to have to remember, and more easy to recognize shapes.\n\n*GRAMMAR*\n\nMandarin is a SVO language like English, which removes a difficult aspect that the other non-Chinese languages have.\n\n**CANTONESE**\n\n*TONES*\n\nAgain, Cantonese has 9 tones, or more. I guess if you want to go hard with Cantonese first, it will make Mandarin seem easier by comparison.\n\n*HANZI*\n\nCantonese use traditional Chinese characters. This is beneficial for learning both Simplified Chinese Hanzi, and Kanji, as they will either directly share some characters, or you'll be able to see how one became the other.\n\nThis works the other way too, though. Since you're mainly carrying over shapes, and not always meaning let alone sound.\n\n*GRAMMAR*\n\nSVO language like English and Mandarin\n\n*RESOURCES*\n\nLast I knew, resources for Cantonese were slim and hard to come by. \n\n**CONCLUSION**\n\nThere is no methodical way to acquire these languages.  \n\nJapanese, Korean, Mandarin, and Cantonese are languages. As such there is no real scaling from easy to hard. They're all fairly equal when it comes to their pros and cons. They're all going to be equally difficult for a learner, only in different ways.\n\nThey share some aspects of each other, in the same way that English shares aspects with some European languages.\n\nThat may make them mutually easier to learn, but again, no one language will make a good bridge to the next or the next.\n\nThe order in which you learn these languages is, therefore, purely to your discretion.

I couldn't tell you where each word ended or began, or what the verbs conjugated to, or what the words were in general.\n\nBecause of the shallowness of the lessons, there was no way I could pick them apart or mix and match them to create my own sentences, and I was confined to a set of phrases (and not even responses!) that I was unlikely to ever stumble across let alone need.\n\nAnd true to form, those are 3 sentences I've never heard in the wild.\n\nI listened to the discs over and over and over again when I was newly learning... but that was before the time of apps and things. It was one of the few resources I had... and looking back on it now, I don't see how I could have really used them to make any real sort of gain anyway.\n\nThey weren't very well organized, and didn't build up from 0 to functional language. I was lacking vocabulary, a grasp of grammar, and real learning structure in general. \n\nIt's only a decade after using them last that I can tell you what the phrases burned into my brain actually break up into. \n\nIt's a nice idea, but I'm afraid it's poorly executed. Though if properly executed I don't think many people would buy the product... they'd probably consider it too slow. :/\n\nOn that note I did the first lesson of Japanese Pimsleur... and I started out understanding the skit perfectly, and then with the \"say the words backwards\" and crap in the middle I left really confused. Tested the French and the German first lessons on my mom and my husband respectively and they too started out understanding what was going on, and ending very \"WTF was that supposed to accomplish?!\"", "created_utc": "1658425141.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ih2tfrl", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_w4kkgt", "parent_id": "t3_w4kkgt", "score": "4", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "BitterBloodedDemon", "body": "It should. \n\nIt works on desktop.

Some phrases were picked up as a whole. But there was a LOT of word look up. \n\nWith my grandma it was the same thing. Back then there was no internet, but she kept a Spanish to English dictionary at her side and would constantly be looking up words.\n\nBefore coaxing these stories out (you have to ask the right questions sometimes) I watched HUNDREDS if not THOUSANDS of hours of TV in my TL and never picked up anything. It didn't matter if I previously knew the show or knew the words or anything.\n\n(>_>) more frustrating... if the English subs were on and I glanced at them I had zero problem picking out the words being said.\n\nWhen I changed tactics to match what the girl told me, I started making leaps and bounds of progress.

I don't remember really what I was doing as a beginner. No clue what my rep process was or anything. So I know 100% what I tell people is oversimplified.\n\nWith the look up process, the amount of words one looks up quickly fall by the wayside. And increasingly unknown words can be picked up from context only. So it's likely many non-native speakers got past that stage quickly and shrugged off that step as unnecessary.\n\nAlso: though it's possible to learn the meaning of entirely unknown phrases from audio only, and very little visual context... I've done it before... I always treat these as fluke happenings, not the rule.\n\nI went YEARS not being able to do that. And ca. Do it easier and quicker in some languages compared to others. Ability to learn seemingly from nothing but TV, varies person-to-person and language-to-language, and is reliant on how much context you can grasp.\n\nFor this reason I say:\n\n1. Do not continue blindly watching TV if you're not picking up anything. You can easily be trapped listening for years and never getting better, letting the faith that it will click soon for sure! This is the correct method! Leads you on.\n\n2. On the other hand don't let it make you think it's a YOU problem. More often than not with these methods someone isn't divulging EVERYTHING they did, or don't know themselves exactly how it happened. Don't give up. Just change to a more hands on approach for a while.\n\n3. Don't be scared about having to look up every other word, even. Media has a finite set of core vocabulary that repeats early and often. You'll end up picking up quite a bit of it faster than you expect. It's 100% worth the time and effort. (Though maybe gather a foundation in the language before doing this.

It doesn't really help me anymore, but on a browser you can use Memrise to make your own decks and it puts your cards into different mini-games. So I'm much more fond of it than Anki.\n\nMaggie Sensei is my favorite place for grammar. You can find almost any grammar point there. So if you run into something you don't understand, I'd google \"(grammar point) Maggie Sensei\" first.\n\nTalk to yourself. Name out the things around you, talk to yourself to the best of your abilities. It really helps. Well at least for me and my toddler. LOL.\n\nI actually **DON'T** recommend watching anything without subtitles. I did that for YEARS, with stuff I actually knew in English, and I made no listening progress. \n\nPersonally I'm really fond of pairing Netflix with the Language Reactor chrome extension. You can set it to auto pause after every line. [A] key plays the previous line, [S] replays the current line, [D] jumps to the next line, and [SPACE] continues playing. It's really helped me get my listening skills from zero to functional.\n\nYou can also set it up to have 2 sets of subtitles, TL and NL, and you can hide one or both!\n\nI would start with Japanese Original Language shows with Japanese subtitles, because the two will match. Shows dubbed in Japanese generally won't end up with matching subtitles. That can be a real pain when just starting out.\n\nDo some passive listening too, I do when I'm working, and just let yourself pick out whatever you can and don't worry about the rest.\n\nFor immersion based stuff, you can put new words in cards if you want, or on a spreadsheet, or keep a notebook. I've done all three, but for now I just let the TV show or game be its own SRS, I don't write anything down, and I don't really stress if I don't remember the words and have to look them up again and again.

I don't output great because I don't talk as much as I should... but I DO spend a lot of time talking to myself, so what I do say is fluid and comes to me without having to conjugate or think about word structure.

She now knows body parts, colors, a hand full of nouns, the word for mom, and a couple of basic instructions.\n\nAs children our language builds up like this:\n\n* Cat (nouns)\n* A cat (nouns and articles)\n* That is a cat (3-4 word sentences)\n* The cat is on the table (multiple nouns + action words)\n\nAnd so on as you build vocabulary.\n\nIf you never build a child's vocabulary or grammar, and you set them in front of a TV to watch cartoons made for people with established vocabulary and grammar. They'll never understand.\n\nAnother example.\n\nMy kids can learn words from a show that shows pictures and says words.\n\n* (picture of a fire truck) Shoubousha!\n* Kazan doko? (volcano in the background lights up) Kazan da!\n\nThrough repetition and visual cues.\n\nBut they are not going to understand:\n\n* (everyone looking at a wall that a giant is peeking over) Sono hi, jinrui wa omoidashita.

I also reference some things I remember learning my native language.\n\n> Experts estimate that roughly 20K word families are known by an adult native speaker, I am pretty positive that only a fraction of it was learned explicitly.\n\nIt depends on what you mean by explicitly. Because it's more obvious when a parent is pointing at a dog and saying \"Dog\" to a baby. Or telling a toddler \"I'm stirring the soup. Can you say stir?\"\n\nBut less obvious when you're a grown ass adult learning new words for your job, or learning the subtle differences between two maneuvers for a skill, or anything really.\n\nAnd it's all explicitly taught via comprehensive input + visual or audio cue.\n\nSo like... you would understand 99% of what's being said, with 1 word you don't, and that one word will be followed by a visual cue... the item itself... or if it's an action, a visual of the action.\n\nOr an audio cue; a detailed explanation of what the word means.\n\nOr option C, sometimes you're given neither and have to take it upon yourself to google what it means. As a Native English speaker, there are a LOT of instances where I must do this.\n\nIf you aren't picking up any more words via immersion, then you've exhausted all the comprehensive clues of whatever it was you were watching. Your brain can't absorb knowledge out of thin air, and it does need enough to make proper connections.\n\nSo frankly. I don't comprehensive input. At this point it's too hard for me to find something a stairstep above where I'm at, so I just intake whatever. Arguably... TV shows made for native speakers of 13+... and ESPECIALLY shows aimed at full grown adults... are going to be particularly poor about having visual or audio cues to help make sense of what's being said. It would be too much hand-holding for older audiences.\n\nSo I fill in the gaps with a bilingual dictionary.

I can speak my native English, but I don't know how the grammar works. It's all based on \"what sounds right\". I could take a guess, but I'd probably be wrong. Being a native speaker =/= the qualifications to teach the language.\n\n> Natives can also compare and contrast and tell you the nuances to distinguish similar structures\n\nNot always. As a Native English speaker who has helped Native Japanese speakers discern nuances between similar words or sentence structures, it's sometimes been really hard to pinpoint the difference between the two. And sometimes not something I've felt qualified to answer.\n\n> The one aspect where natives may fall short is they may be unable to provide some tricks to learn stuff that's second-nature to them\n\nThat's basically my whole argument.\n\nSo I think there's a little bit of confusion here.\n\nI'm NOT trying to say that Natives are not qualified to teach their language. There are certainly plenty that are.\n\nWhat I'm trying to say is JUST BECAUSE someone is a Native Speaker, doesn't qualify them to be able to teach you how to speak the language.\n\nThere are TONS of ways Native input can help you, even without being qualified to teach per-se.\n\nIf you have the basics down, and you're working on speaking, you make a post, you get a grammar or wording correction, that's one thing. At that juncture, you're likely to be able to infer what you did wrong just from the correction. \n\nIf not, though, and you ask \"Oh why is X wrong but Y isn't? What's the difference?\" THIS is where having a native speaker try to teach you is likely to go wrong.\n\nBecause as you said. The native knows what sounds natural and what doesn't. X doesn't sound natural, but Y does. But just because you know X sounds natural and Y doesn't, doesn't mean you know HOW or WHY that's the case. Often leaving the explanation as \".... it just isn't correct...\" THATS why you need someone qualified to teach you.\n\nAnd a qualification isn't necessarily a degree or a certificate... but just the knowledge to be able to explain these things.\n\nSo again. Not all natives have that knowledge needed to teach a foreigner the language. Just because a Native speaks the language does not automatically mean they can explain it.

It's very hands on, and outside of that I try to provide websites to check up on the grammar. \n\nI found that I learned grammar points better when I was actively needing or using them, which kind of makes the grammar source a supplement resource to be used as needed.\n\nThe right apps IMO build up vocab and sentences to get more and more complex. Close to how we learned our native language, building in complexity, and involving a lot of engagement. The grammar explanations serve only to help wrap your head around how the words are reacting to one another different than your native language does.\n\nPeople, especially in this economical climate are also generally after free resources. It's hard to say with certainty that one textbook or another will work for them, so there's a risk of them losing money they couldn't necessarily afford to throw away. A free app or website is low risk, and if one doesn't work another one can be easily procured. IMHO, things like language knowledge should be free and accessible for everyone to learn... but that's an argument for another time.\n\nIn the past I've been in the position to have to teach myself, in school, from a text book.\n\nThe textbook itself was not sufficient, and in order to grasp the lesson it was trying to teach I had to seek out secondary online sources. Admittedly this was with math though...\n\nI have a Japanese grammar text book, a small one. When I started language learning textbooks were hard for me to come by. We didn't have the money to throw at such things, and or we weren't in an area that had language textbooks available for purchase. \n\nIn any case, even the textbook I DID own, again, wasn't sufficient. The explanations were simple enough, but I struggled to retain the information as I wasn't able to use it immediately, and I struggled, despite the explanations, to figure out what I was looking at with the example sentences.\n\nBecause unfortunately my textbook expected me to have some amount of information onboard already, which I didn't have. And I had no instructor to work out the bits I was missing.\n\nSometimes it's not obvious what information a textbook expects you to have, or not to have. So again, you're stuck supplementing with free resources if you can't just throw money at it and get more books.\n\nFinally, I've had the privilege of using the college library while I was there, and they also had language textbooks... but those weren't allowed to leave the library... and with such a finite amount of time to browse them, and being otherwise busy, it just didn't end up being really helpful.\n\nUltimately, free internet resources were much more easily accessible, and the people contributing to them would/will post differently worded explanations. Sometimes one source is great for one thing, but a different resource is better about explaining another. A textbook doesn't really grant that (though having a human teacher would alleviate a textbook's shortcomings).\n\nFinally IF your textbook comes with activities... IF.... then they're really only good for one go. Some apps can randomize sentences, or switch things up with different kinds of activities. This can aide in solidifying the lesson better over time as you can come back and re-do it and it will be different than last time.\n\nBut textbook activities will be the same every time you visit them.

I didn't learn all those until much much later. The above will get you by fine until you start getting comfortable with everything.\n\nIn the past, IDK about now, learning materials were REALLY GOOD about hiding all the other conjugations behind a curtain and only presenting you with those 4-8. It was YEARS before I really became aware of the others, and by then it was really easy to wrap my head around.\n\n**KANJI**\n\nKanji's the big scary. And I stayed pretty far away from it too. I had no intention on learning how to read because the sheer volume of Onyomi and Kunyomi was too much.\n\nNow, ironically, reading is my highest skill. I pick up Kanji like candy. No problem.\n\nThe thing is, I never learned onyomi or kunyomi. I just learned the words as is. (I didn't really learn radicals either... I just use them to look up kanji I don't know).\n\nSo we'll take \u5b50, that's my favorite example. I went YEARS reading \u5b50's different readings without even registering they were all \u5b50.\n\n* \u606f**\u5b50** musu**ko**\n* \u6905**\u5b50** i**su**\n* \u5e3d**\u5b50** bou**shi**\n\nNever once even thought about it, because I learned these words like this:\n\nSon = musuko\n\nMusuko = \u606f\u5b50\n\nChair = isu\n\nisu = \u6905\u5b50\n\nHat = boushi\n\nboushi = \u5e3d\u5b50\n\nI treated Kanji like a form of spelling, not a phonetic marker. These words just so happen to be spelled with \u5b50 but it makes no impact on their sound.\n\nSo for \n\n\u98df\u3079\u308b I know because the character that comes after \u98df is \u3079, that \u98df is saying \"ta\"\n\nAlternatively, if I see \u98df\u3046 \u2190 with that \u3046 there. I know \u98df is saying \"Ku\" because I know the word \"Kuu\" (because the first time I came across \u98df\u3046 I went \"WTF is that?!\" and looked it up)\n\nWith Japanese and reading, you're not reading like WE think of reading. You're not phonetically reading everything. You're looking at the kanji, and possibly a kanji+hiragana combination and recalling what it means. Kind of like looking at emojis. It's more of a pictogram than reading per-se.\n\nSometimes there are patterns, but you'll just pick those up naturally as you go. The rest is just a matter of looking up words you don't know and remembering the word's pronunciation kind of separate from the kanji that makes it up.\n\nWHEW!! That's still a lot of info. Don't worry about it though. Just take it in bite sized chunks it will all come together eventually.\n\nAs for school... ehhhh...

I wanted to go to college in Japan, and time was running out. I threw myself at it even harder!\n\n:/ And despite working even harder and for more hours a day for an entire year I made little progress.\n\nFor my first year of US College I slipped behind in my Japanese study and got busy. Toward the end of that year it became clear that there was no way I was going to Japan, for school or any other reason.\n\nSo on the one hand the pressure came off... but on the other life after that just got more busy. I dropped out, got married, had a kid, and in my mind that put my goals even further away. It was sad... in that I felt I'd never learn Japanese... but I kept finding myself coming back to it and studying it off and on because I conditioned it into my daily routine.\n\nin 2012 I went on hiatus as life got too busy... and didn't pick it up again outside of Duolingo reps until the start of COVID.\n\nWhen I started up again I had little hope I'd get anywhere. I still didn't understand any spoken Japanese. I could read faster but I could understand virtually nothing I read. And I wanted to work on it... but in the end it didn't really matter if I succeeded or not. \n\nAt that point the coping came from... this is the only language I want to learn... I enjoy learning it... and after 14 years I'm unlikely to get anywhere with it... but it's not like I need it anyway. Still it was pretty depressing. But I kept chipping away. \n\nNow 2 years later I'm understanding TV shows, I'm understanding things I read.

But I try to make it clear that the translations I provide for learning purposes ARE NOT necessarily the best translation for entertainment purposes.\n\nEX:\n\n**\u6f22\u5b57:** \u5973\u795e\u306e\u5263\u3092\u624b\u306b\u5165\u308c\u305f\uff01\u795e\u3005\u3057\u3044\u5149\u3092\u5e2f\u3073\u305f\u795e\u79d8\u306e\u5263\n\n**\u304b\u306a:** \u3081\u304c\u307f\u3000\u306e\u3000\u3064\u308b\u304e\u3000\u3066\u3000\u306b\u3000\u3044\u308c\u305f\uff01\u3000\u3053\u3046\u3054\u3046\u3057\u3044\u3000\u3072\u304b\u308a\u3000\u3092\u3000\u304a\u3073\u305f\u3000\u3057\u3093\u3074\u3000\u306e\u3000\u3064\u308b\u304e\n\n**Romaji:** Megami no tsurugi te ni ireta!

It's that word.\"\n\nThen the third time you're like \"Ah... I should know this word... -look it up- oh that's right!\"\n\n4th time \"Crap what was it again? -looks it up- Oh, yeah ok.\"\n\n5th time \"Wait I think that word is ____ -looks it up- YES!\"\n\nAnd unlike an Anki deck which will circle the card back around until you get it, the word is going to pop up whenever its needed. It could be in a couple of sentences, or a couple of pages, and in between you'll be looking up all sorts of other words.\n\nAnd I get how that sounds overwhelming. That's A LOT, but as you're going through you're also piecing together a story. So while you're going along you have something to show for your efforts besides \"passed\" cards. \n\nAnd you WILL pick up the core vocabulary of the media you're reading/watching. Every piece of media has a finite core vocabulary. Some of that overarches through the entire series, some are going to be confined to one chapter or episode, but in any case it's all finite.\n\nSo as you pick up those new words... one here... another there... more and more of what you're reading or watching will be understandable WITHOUT having to look those things up.\n\nWhich allows you to pick up more core vocabulary.\n\nWhich allows you to look up less words.\n\nUntil eventually you're understanding large chunks if not nearly full episodes/pages/chapters of media. \n\nDo that with 2 or 3 pieces of media and your brain no longer gets overwhelmed. So when you start a new piece of media, full of words you don't know, your brain is like \"We got this, no problem. Let's get cracking.\"\n\nOtherwise I don't worry about retention at all. I give zero fucks about retention. I will 100% forget every word I look up. If its an important word, it will be repeated enough for me to learn it, without me going out of my way.\n\nIf I never see it again, it wasn't that important anyway. All I want to do is get from the beginning of a story to the end, and any words I pick up, and anything I understand without looking it up, is a bonus!\n\nBasically if you have no expectations you can't be disappointed.\n\nIt might have helped that I went into this totally burned out and bummed. I had been using Memrise and trying to learn vocabulary they use for proficiency tests... and I was just SUCKING BAD. So many cards I just was not getting no matter what. And I was also feeling desperate because my wording for what I DID know was unnatural... so I started translating Pokemon.\n\nAnd I went into it with SO MUCH PESSAMISM. I told myself \"Ok. This is going to be AWFUL. This is going to be painful and boring and slow. Playing this game 1-2 hours a day, EVERY DAY and talking to EVERYONE... it's likely going to take me an entire year to get through.\" and I sat down and started wrote memorizing new words and phrases.\n\nThen after a couple of days of play I found I didn't have to write things down... I could look up the word and just keep going...\n\nThen after a few more days I found that I was understanding like... up to 3 bubbles of dialogue between word look ups.\n\nBy the time I was in the first gym town I was reading at a slow but decent speed, and really only looking up a few words here and there. ... and then I stopped playing that one.\n\nI picked up another pokemon game, started from the beginning, and found that I was going through at a decent speed. Looking up almost nothing. I got to like the 2nd gym, still talking to everyone, in a reasonable amount of time... and then I quit.\n\nA couple of months later we got Pokemon Brilliant Diamond. In that one I found myself going at virtually English speed, with very few word look ups... I'm probably at the 4th gym or so...\n\nThen Legends Arceus came out, and I was able to play at the same speed as my husband, who is playing in our Native English. Again with very very few word look ups.\n\nI bounce around a lot so it's hard to say how I would be if I just stuck something out end to end, but after 5 pokemon games, 5 Mario games, Katamari, Legend of Zelda, Kake Gurui, Good Morning Call, Carmen Sandiego, Aggretsuko, Dare Devil, and the Dark Crystal, to name a few... I'm a REALLY OLD hand at this looking up words over and over again thing. (>_>) and I really only started this during COVID.\n\nIt adds up too. So there are shows I've started where I haven't had to look up ANYTHING. But there are still shows with very specific vocabulary where I have to look up every other word still (... like Assassins Creed Black Flag...).\n\nAgain though, once you start seeing that progress, it goes from daunting, to damn near addicting.", "created_utc": "1656371412.0", "edited": "False", "id": "idzkb0y", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_vklq1l", "parent_id": "t1_idz7w1v", "score": "1", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "BitterBloodedDemon", "body": "Sorry refold is the only non-specific language community like refold that I can think of.

Spanish is her first language, she lived in Chile until she was in her early 20s, then came to the US. She speaks English now, fluently, but with a very thick accent. \n\nRecently, she went back to Chile to visit family, and while there took a taxi, with a family member, to go do some shopping.\n\nIn the taxi, after telling the driver where they wanted to go (in Spanish) the taxi driver turned around and asked my grandmother IN ENGLISH \"So what part of the USA are you from?\"\n\nMy grandmother shares your dismay. In her Spanish she now carries an American accent, and in English she carries a Spanish accent. As she puts it \"I am now a foreigner in both countries.\"\n\nBut this isn't a bad thing. Accent is a badge of honor you wear as someone who knows more than one language.\n\nAccent shows where you've come from, and where you've been. To an extent, you'll never get rid of it. And that's OK!! You are a bilingual person, you are fluent in Farsi AND in English. That's wonderful. It's only natural your Farsi would come with an accent, even if your parents speak without one.\n\nFeel free to learn Spanish, or any other language. An accent is not proof that you are bad at the language. And lack of accent isn't proof that you're good at it either.

Like if you have to look up every other word, you'll be looking up every other word throughout the whole media. But actually, each piece of media, and even each episode arc, has a finite set of core vocabulary.\n\nThat core vocabulary is also likely to repeat throughout the over-arc of a TV show, which just solidifies the knowlege.\n\nSo as you go along, you're making the next episode, and the next episode, and the next easier.\n\nAnd all that vocabulary? Also transfers over to any other thing you read or watch. \n\nHaving had to take a different route to listening comprehensibility. I recommend people who struggle to learn from listening try to watch something with Japanese CC subtitles.\n\nIf you use something like Language Reactor, you can set the show to auto-pause after every line. Replaying, and moving forward and backwards between lines is also shortcutted to a couple of keys. Meaning you can auto-pause, process, and replay lines as necessary. Which is what I had to do to help my brain start breaking apart a string of nonsense sound into comprehensible words. I can now watch things with non-matching subtitles, or even no subtitles at all.\n\nDual subtitles is also a thing. I recommend keeping the English ones hidden, but if you know all the words and you just can't make it make sense, you can unhide the English sub. Just make sure you analyze it to know how one became the other.\n\nBesides that I look up a lot of words. It helps me build vocabulary. Though I don't bother to write those words down or put them in a deck to review or anything. I look them up as fast as possible and move on.\n\nLike OP I also prefer new content. So I bounce around a lot.\n\nNot trying to take away from OP! Language learning is a unique process for everyone.

Do you learn hiragana first, then katakana, then kanji? Or do you learn them all at once?\n\nHonestly I didn't learn to read for the first couple of years. I'd start with Hiragana, move to Katakana, and then Kanji. Maybe do Hiragana and Katakana together, but defs Kanji last.\n\n> Second question: A friend gave me the Genki textbooks, but what do they teach exactly? Is it for complete beginners? And again, is it hiragana, katakana or kanji?\n\nCan't answer this one, I never used Genki.\n\n> Third question: Did anyone here just learn how to speak and hear Japanese, and only learned how to write afterwards? Like memorizing all the words and pronunciation etc. If so, how did that work out? I read that it feels like being illiterate, but it must be nice to speak japanese and it must also be a lot faster/easier to learn.\n\nFourth question: What are the best ways to learn Japanese by yourself? What is the most efficient step by step? For example: Learning hiragana first from Book A, while using some online website that helps with pronouncing the sounds/words? And then maybe another book for katakana? What are the best recommended books/websites and in what order do you use it?\n\nFifth question: How long did it take you to learn Japanese? How many hours / years? I heard even native Japanese people struggle with Kanji, so how are foreigners ever able to do it? It must be impossible to memorize 2000 characters.\n\nI tried! I had no intention of learning to read, it seemed impossible. But I had an audio processing problem I couldn't shake, so before I knew it reading became easier than anything else. Now 2000 characters seems like nothing. I pick up new kanji like candy.\n\n> How did you learn Japanese? How would you do it, if you could start all over again? I would like to optimize my strategy from the start. Thank you!\n\nSlowly. There were less resources when I started. I learned a bunch of stand along words first, and super basic sentences, all in romaji. Learned hiragana and katakana sometime later. Built up vocabulary more than grammar because I couldn't keep tae kim or maggie sensei lessons internalized, and only gained any real stride when apps started to become available. I hung out in apps too long because media was too hard, before I realized to make media easier you have to study your media. So now all my studying is looking up words as I watch or read something. I fixed my audio processing issue when Japanese subtitles became readily available on streaming services.\n\nIf I could do it again, I would work on kana while picking up loose vocabulary and basic grammar, then I would move to Kanji, since at the start it's hard to wrap one's head around. I'd defs play around on apps. Go to maggie sensei or Tae kim for grammar explanations as needed, and let the app sentences solidify that knowledge. Once apps started to become easy, I'd bite the bullet and start pulling apart media with a dictionary and aforementioned grammar guides.\n\nThat kind of all requires starting in this decade, but I'm sure it'd be faster.", "created_utc": "1654444568.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ib9i512", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_v5d7e0", "parent_id": "t3_v5d7e0", "score": "1", "subreddit": "LearnJapanese", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qyls"}, {"author": "BitterBloodedDemon", "body": "Yeah.

Mostly with a dictionary, a pocket grammar guide, and a few grammar related websites.\n\nI studied my ass off for 7 years. I listened to Japanese between 4 and 16 hours a day, I studied almost every free moment I had, at home, at school, wherever. Even though I got good at coursework related things, I couldn't understand any spoken Japanese, my reading was slow, and I couldn't understand anything I read.\n\nBy the time Duolingo came along I was able to breeze through the reverse tree, and explain grammar points and functions fairly easily. More or less, I knew Japanese in theory... and only in a learning setting.\n\nBy the time Duo came around I was already in hiatus though. I set down Japanese in 2012, and didn't pick it up until right around the start of the pandemic. \n\nToward the end of 2019, though, I discovered that when playing Pokemon, I understood enough Japanese to follow bare bones physical directions and objectives. No story.\n\nMuch like you, at around mid 2020 I got really depressed and thought for sure I had come as far as I could with the language. I found that even though I could hold conversations almost all of my phrasing was strange. And I STILL couldn't understand anything spoken.\n\nIn a fit of desperation I picked up Pokemon Shield and started dissecting it. Going word-by-word and line-by-line. Looking up everything I didn't know, writing down words and sentences, and making sure I understood everything before I moved on.\n\nBy the second week, I found to my surprise, that I was starting to read more than I was looking things up. I was still looking up A LOT, and I had stopped writing it down, but it was much less than when I had started. That was... IDK... late 2020... start of 2021 somewhere? ...\n\nI moved on to TV shows. Sitting down and playing them line-for-line with Japanese subtitles on. Matching what I was reading to what I was hearing. Now, though I'm still picking up a TON of vocabulary, I'm starting to be able to watch dubbed shows with non-matching subs, or shows without subtitles at all.\n\nIt's like everything I learned over my initial 7 years has been falling into place. I don't follow the JLPT, I likely never will. I tried to go through some things, and found that despite what I understand my knowledge on the JLPT scale is patchy.\n\nThere's some N4 stuff I don't know, but alternatively, there's some N1 stuff I DO know. I tried to study it but I can't keep the loose grammar and seemingly useless words in my head. I learn better with context.\n\nMy phone has permanently been in Japanese for 2 years now.\n\nI've been able to play things like Pokemon Brilliant Diamond, and Legends Arceus, without much word look up. So little in fact that I actually get annoyed when I hit a rough patch.\n\nA lot of what I do now is just vocab gathering. Which is still a monumental amount depending on the media. But it's a far cry from where I was.\n\nOne also should bear in mind, that there were far less resources available even 10 years ago, than there are today. And some of us were kids when we started, with no real direction on learning. It's going to be slow if you're just piecing things together yourself with google translate.\n\nSometimes we're hindered by life, happenstance, resources, understanding of directions, or just the way our brain learns and comprehends things. It feels like people try so hard to compete with each other over it, but it doesn't matter if you reach fluency sooner or later.

But I also took AJATT's crazy advice at the time. I only gave myself the option of Japanese to watch and listen to, largely. That isn't necessary! Though it set me up for good habits.

And that's the problem, is a lot of people think it is. I took \"Sit down, immerse, endure\" as \"Listen to Japanese 24/7, read what you don't understand, just do and you'll absorb it!!\" and I did that FOR YEARS without any improvement.\n\nNow it's obvious, and I can look back on AJATT advice and go \"OH! That's why sentence mining! I was supposed to be taking this stuff apart the WHOLE TIME!!\"\n\nYeah I pick apart EVERYTHING.\n\nI recently started Assassin's Creed Black Flag. I'm about 15 minutes into the game and it's taken me 3 hours. It's got a LOT of words I don't know.

It's a nice pushbutton dialogue game, and it was fairly new for us in my house. I went through word-by-word and sentence-by-sentence.\n\nWriting looking up and writing down new words.\n\nWriting down the sentences they were in.\n\nLooking up grammar points I didn't understand.\n\nand translating everything until I understood it. Which sometimes involved throwing  phrase in google translate and trying to figure out how the words worked together to come to Google's conclusion. Eventually I stopped writing everything down and moved to just looking up words.\n\nFor TV shows I did the same thing. I picked shows whose original language was Japanese and used Japanese subtitles to follow along.\n\nI paired Language Reactor with Netflix so that I could auto pause after every line and replay it as necessary until I could match what I was hearing to what I was reading.\n\nFor social media I took a day and looked up a LOT of words so I could navigate better.\n\nNow it's been 2 years with my phone in Japanese full time, I can understand some shows almost fully just with audio, and I can play through some games with little word look up. Pretty much all I do now is vocab gather.\n\nAnd somewhere along the way it actually became fun.

(of course the resources available back then were far less...)\n\nAnymore, I DO NOT recommend 8+ hours of study. It really isn't any more bang for your buck. And the people who do it DO hit that point of diminishing returns, and just push past it.

You make everything bite-sized and enjoyable, and avoid the things that feel like work.\n\nFor instance, Anki felt like work.... so I dropped it.

I can read a fair amount of Mandarin, and have picked up new characters and meanings very quickly from my Japanese speaking background, but the listening/speaking aspect is lost on me.\n\nI was interested to see how well I could pick up another SOV language and was dabbling in Korean, but I got stuck at the alphabet. I wasn't really interested in learning a new alphabet, even while I was learning Japanese, and that stance persists today.\n\nI can read, and sometimes understand spoken, Spanish, French, and German, because they share a lot with English.

So it, in a way, makes it manageable and not overwhelming.\n\nNext thing you know you'll have internalized ALL SORTS of crazy grammar without realizing it.\n\n**My Advice**\n\nToy around with Duolingo. You can read kana and it builds you up with super short sentences to more complex ones. I find that a lot more beneficial than Memrise or Anki that often prioritize single words over sentences.\n\nOr worse, give you a word, and then feed you a sentence that you now only know THAT word to.\n\nSupplement that with something like [Tae Kim](https://guidetojapanese.org/learn/), or [Maggie Sensei](https://maggiesensei.com/) (websites) for grammar explanation. Because Duolingo's grammar explanations suck.\n\nIf you want to try your hand at pulling apart some media (stick to slice of life at first) I'd recommend [jisho.org](https://jisho.org/) or takoboto (app) for dictionaries. Also look into Rikaikun for google chrome. It's a hover dictionary.\n\nYotsubato is a good starter manga. Pokemon and Mario are good starter games. Sailor Moon and Aggretsuko aren't too bad for beginners (subs are available on Netflix). Know that things can be hit and miss comprehension wise. Some things I can understand really well, and other things I don't understand at all. So don't get discouraged if you grab a thing or two that you can't get anything from.\n\nYou can pair Netflix with Language Reactor on your chrome browser. It will let you use multiple subtitles and it also has a hover dictionary.\n\nAs a bonus, check out [Erin's Challenge](https://www.erin.jpf.go.jp/en/). They've got fun little skits and activities.\n\n:) Please don't be discouraged. There's a learning curve, and it takes more time than some other languages.

I was simply listing a couple of off the cuff pain points I see others have.

We've got a point of reference so to speak to bounce off of. \n\nIt's different than how children learn, but it has the potential to be more efficient. \n\nLargely I don't think an adult can learn exactly the same way a child does because finding someone willing to sit there and spend a lot of time building your understanding up from simple words, to short sentences, to more complex things is going to be EXTREMELY hard.\n\nAnd secondly because I don't know anyone who would have the patience to start that low and slow. Adults don't typically have that kind of patience.", "created_utc": "1650298480.0", "edited": "False", "id": "i582zpw", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_u6gknc", "parent_id": "t3_u6gknc", "score": "1", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "BitterBloodedDemon", "body": "Sometimes it's emphasis.\n\nSometimes it's just a thing, like you'll find animal names, though they have a kanji, mostly written in katakana.\n\nSometimes it's because the word is also used as a euphemism or slang for something else and they want to show that secondary meaning. \n\nSometimes (generally in writing) katakana will be used in place of kanji because the kanji is either too complicated/time consuming to bother writing out, or they've forgotten the kanji that's supposed to be used.", "created_utc": "1650292753.0", "edited": "False", "id": "i57ow60", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_u5zq2w", "parent_id": "t1_i55ebgy", "score": "1", "subreddit": "LearnJapanese", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qyls"}, {"author": "BitterBloodedDemon", "body": "If it's a noun that isn't a na-adjective (double check places like [jisho.org](https://jisho.org/)) then it would take \u7684 to turn it into an adjective.\n\nIf it's a \u306a adjective on its own, the dictionary entry will say \"Na adjective\" or will have a big \u306a somewhere to let you know.", "created_utc": "1650207878.0", "edited": "False", "id": "i537jf9", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_u5amua", "parent_id": "t1_i52lp7f", "score": "2", "subreddit": "LearnJapanese", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qyls"}, {"author": "BitterBloodedDemon", "body": "\u3092 marks a word that's being directly acted upon by a verb.\n\nSo like... \u672c\u3092\u8aad\u3080 you read a book \n\nOr \u3054\u306f\u3093\u3092\u98df\u3079\u308b you eat lunch\n\nThese are things physically and actively done to an object.\n\nBut passive things... such as existing, or already being in a state like say a door or window being open or closed without someone actively doing so... do not take \u3092 they take \u304c.\n\nAlso, particles FOLLOW the noun they modify. so the noun being acted on by a verb will have the particle between the noun and the verb.\n\nSo like\n\n\u732b\u304c\u3044\u308b - a cat exists\n\n\u672c\u304c\u3042\u308b - a book exists\n\n\u7a93\u304c\u958b\u3044\u305f - The window is open\n\n\u96fb\u6c17\u304c\u6d88\u3048\u308b - the lights are off\n\nWITH THE EXCEPTION OF \u3067\u3059 WHICH IS A COPULA!\n\nAs in, it doesn't take a particle before the verb.\n\nFor \u3067\u3059 phrases (at this stage) you will be using either \u306f or \u304c.
