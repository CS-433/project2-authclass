There was *absolutely* a plan in place - there was *literally a powerpoint presentation* outlining the plan. Not sure if you're trying to sow disinformation and downplay the events of Jan 6th on purpose or you're just naive of what actually went on that day. But either way, recommend reading up on it.\n\nNot sure why you think you'd need tanks for it to count as a coup, maybe look up the word \"coup\" in a dictionary while you're at it. A coup just means an illegal seizure of government power, which is the absolute definition of what they were attempting to achieve.\n\nAs for \"no chance of ever succeeding\"? If Pence had either followed Trump's orders not to ratify the election results, or had gotten into the car and fled the capitol earlier and left proceedings to the next in line (who would certainly have done Trump's bidding in his place), Trump would been able to go through with his plan of installing fake electors who would have refused to call the election for Biden.\n\n\"No chance of ever succeeding\"... you have no idea how close they came. Pence might be a far right bigot, but his actions prevented a literal coup. This wasn't a random riot.\n\nDon't follow the narrative, whether right or left wing. Follow the facts.

He'd wanted to learn to play his whole life and he was finally getting the chance to do it. Most of my other students were teenagers who never practiced, and never really improved beyond the basics. That included a pair of twins whose parents insisted I teach them together, because \"they do everything together\"... they dropped out after 5 lessons.\n\nMeanwhile, Jeff the electrician took his grade 1 exam after only 3 months of weekly lessons and passed with a distinction. His examiner's comment for one of his pieces was that \"he played a grade 1 piece at at least a grade 3 level\". He took me out for a curry as thanks and was beaming all evening, and was close to tears when talking about it.\n\nAfter that I referred him to a proper piano teacher because I no longer had the time to teach regularly.

I say \"friend\"; we had only gotten to know each other fairly recently as we were in a musical together at school. She was in the year above me so I felt quite cool having an older friend. She was pretty and quite popular, and I was pretty excited that I was one of only two kids in my year who'd been invited.\n\nSo there were about 20 of us there and she was loving all the fawning and attention and presents she was getting from everyone. There was beer, there was wine, there were some snacks, some pizza, some cake... everybody was having a good time. There was an upright piano in the room and I thought it would be nice to play happy birthday for her, and get the whole room to sing it to her.\n\nSo I opened up the piano lid and started playing and got everyone started by singing the first words of the song, and sure enough people joined in singing. We sang a really raucous rendition of happy birthday and I finished with a big flourish on the piano.\n\nA guy behind me asked me to play something else they could sing along to, so I started playing the intro to Don't Look Back in Anger by Oasis. What followed was an even more raucous singalong, people clapping along and singing/shouting a song that everybody knew the words to. It went down a storm.\n\nAgain, I finished with a big flourish, doing arpeggios all the way up and down the piano and landing hard on the final chord. People cheered and whooped and a few high fives came my way, and people started shouting out other songs to sing.\n\nAt that point I turned around expecting to see her happy, I was going to ask if she had a request since she was the birthday girl. But I immediately noticed she was staring *absolute daggers* at me. Her closest friend was at her side and seemed to be consoling her and saying \"it's all right, it's ok\". My heart fell, I closed the piano lid straight away.\n\nApparently she was NOT happy that I'd stolen the spotlight from her on her birthday, at her own party. I tried to explain to her later that I did it in her honour, not to take attention away from her. Up until that point I'd had NO idea she was so insecure.\n\nWe stayed friends after that but we never got any closer (despite us needing to have chemistry in the musical). She didn't invite me to her 17th.\n\nSo yeah, very specific story but I learned from that that no matter your intention, unless somebody actually asks you to play then you shouldn't assume. If I'm somewhere with a piano and somebody asks me to play, I always say \"only if it's OK with (whoever's hosting)\".\n\nThat's as close as I ever got to being the \"anyway, here's Wonderwall\" guy at a party.

One time the parents offered to pay me to come play at a party they were hosting, and I was excited to do it but they never ended up getting back to me.\n\nThey weren't antique pianos or family heirlooms... they were generally pretty new and shiny, usually Yamahas or Kawais. The Baldwin I played was probably my favourite of the lot. But I think they were mostly there as decorative pieces. A grand piano is a pretty beautiful thing to have in your giant living room area, whether it gets played or not. I don't get it either but I've never been in the position of having tens of thousands of pounds spare to spend on furniture.\n\nThere was a kid in the year below me who started learning piano and his parents bought him a flipping *Boesendorfer* to practice on at home.

But it was boring as hell for my friends, we were teenagers and they wanted to play video games and smoke weed or whatever, not listen to me play their piano (which is fair enough). So I never really got to sit down and play properly.\n\nBut it was always a nice little sneak peek into playing nice pianos, because the only other grand piano I ever got to play was at school and it was in a room that was always being used.\n\nI do remember one time while I was working on the Path\u00e9tique Sonata, I started playing it on a friend's beautiful Baldwin grand and his dad came stomping downstairs and told us to \"stop making such a bloody racket\".

I've watched cricket for 30 years, I'm a bit of a cricket tragic, and I don't know the exact way it's calculated, because it has literally never mattered. It's rarely used, and as a viewer you don't need to do anything for the D/L system - umpires work it out by putting the scores so far into a computer and it comes up with the target. Then the team has to score that many runs. Not complicated at all for the players or the viewers.\n\nPersonally I don't really like D/L, usually one team gets slightly shafted.

Super specific, super weird rule.

All of the ones who genuinely wanted to know how the game worked understood the basics within a couple of minutes.

It's actually not that difficult to learn to do if you're vigilant, and again, there's a wealth of information on how to do this (google \"how to spot fake news\").\n\nMisinformation works best on the gullible and those with an an existing agenda/narrative that they seek to reinforce. Diversify your news sources, learn to tell facts from opinion, ignore sources that seek to tell you what to think rather than telling you what happened. Always consider the source/author. Read past the headline. See who else is reporting the story and what information is corroborated. Examine evidence. Don't take images at face value. Do not trust anecdotal accounts. Develop a critical mindset.\n\nBut most of all, don't seek to get your information on current events from Facebook or Reddit comments. Literally anybody can write whatever they want. I know it's easier just to ask somebody to feed you bitesize chunks of knowledge for your convenience, but generally the easier path is the one that leads to unreliable information.\n\nAnd me being a westerner, you wouldn't trust my opinion on it anyway.", "created_utc": "1666153864.0", "edited": "False", "id": "iswdbey", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_y7kq58", "parent_id": "t1_iswbcii", "score": "0", "subreddit": "interestingasfuck", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhsa"}, {"author": "kinggimped", "body": "\u8c22\u8c22\uff01\u6211\u5f88\u7231\u4e2d\u56fd\uff0c\u4e5f\u7231\u4e2d\u56fd\u4eba\u3002\u6700\u5927\u95ee\u9898\u662f\u653f\u5e9c\u3002\u4e60\u8fd1\u5e73\u548c\u4ed6\u7684\u652f\u6301\u8005\u5403\u9519\u836f\u4e86\u3002\u6211\u548c\u592a\u592a\u79bb\u5f00\u4e2d\u56fd\u4ee5\u6765\uff0c\u542c\u5b89\u5fc3\u7684\u3002\n\n\u6211\u5e0c\u671b\u4f60\u548c\u4f60\u5bb6\u4eba\u90fd\u5b89\u5168\uff01:)\n\nSorry for my shit Chinese, it's been a few years", "created_utc": "1666152993.0", "edited": "False", "id": "iswbtuc", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_y7kq58", "parent_id": "t1_isw6dwa", "score": "1", "subreddit": "interestingasfuck", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhsa"}, {"author": "kinggimped", "body": "No, you're probably right.

In private, you can talk about such things with most normal, sane Chinese people. I had many, many eye-opening coversations with my Chinese friends. Not every Chinese person is a rabid nationalist - much like the USA, it's mostly just the loud ones.\n\nThe only place where people felt they could not freely discuss such things unless in *absolute private* (in this case, being three people in a car driving thousands of kilometres over a period of weeks) was when my wife and I took a trip around Xinjiang province in 2016. Outside of total privacy (which does not include being in their own homes), the Uighurs we talked to were very tight-lipped about any type of political discussion. They were also some of the nicest, friendliest, most welcoming people I've ever met. But paranoia and pain followed them around like a shadow. Turns out, in hindsight, they were completely right to be that way, as the CCP ramped up the already insane security in the region (led by the same shitcunt who brought the boot down on Tibet), and have now for several years been committing an unquestionable cultural genocide that the rest of the world has effectively ignored.\n\nChinese people tend to be proud of their country's long history and culture (though they conveniently leave out the fact that the CCP has been only a tiny sliver of that long history). While they are not critical of their government in public or online, privately they do criticise, though are still thankful that they have *something*. The country has developed a huge amount in the last few decades and millions of people have been lifted out of poverty. You have to remember that it's still a developing nation, and the advances in the last 30 or so years have taken them from a mostly agrarian country into the world's factory floor (albeit a ridiculously corrupt, authoritarian factory floor).\n\nThe CCP is one of the most evil forces that exists in the world, but China's older generations have *seen some shit go down*. After the cultural revolution it's not that surprising that they would rather be relatively stable and comfortable while giving away more and more of their freedoms, than risk losing what they already have (which compared to what their parents had for the most part, is substantial).\n\nEdit: I should add that the CCP's zero covid policy is an absolute unmitigated shitshow and the absolute end of all logic and reason. And people are rightfully starting to get angry, though it's doubtful in my opinion that it will go any further than small pockets of resistance. If I were into tin foil hats I would assume that being the progenitors of the virus (whether accidental or otherwise), they know something about covid that the rest of the world still doesn't (much is still unknown about long covid and other long-term effects).

Because of Xithead and his dumbasses in the CCP needing to save face.\n\nThe edict did NOTHING to solve the issue of education inequality - what's needed is an overhaul of China's exam system, which is incredibly competitive and rife with cheating. It's quite common for [Chinese students to hook themselves up to IV drips](https://www.businessinsider.com/chinese-students-are-apparently-hooking-themselves-up-to-iv-drips-because-of-exam-stress-2012-5) to help them deal with exam stress.

Everything was going gangbusters, and the company's next aim was to go public and get listed, either on the Chinese or US stock exchange. The company's biggest problem was managing its insane year-on-year growth (well, and useless, toxic middle managers, but that's just China being China).\n\nI left China in 2017, with tens of thousands of stock options in the company vested, which I'd been taking while being paid less than I should have, because I believed the company would be successful, I believed in the product because I'd played such a large part in designing it, I knew how vastly superior to the competition it was. I continued working for the company as a contracting consultant, no longer gaining stock but at least being paid a good rate now.\n\nInvestment continued in the company year on year in the hundreds of millions of RMB. We had employees all over China, the US, the Philippines, and other parts of the world.\n\nEven if the stocks ended up being worth 5 dollars a pop, my wife and I (who had been working for them longer and had even more stocks than I did) would have stood to be rewarded for our hard work, it would have been more than a deposit on a house here in NZ. The estimates were that the valuation would be far higher than that, but I wanted to temper my expectations. And boy, were they tempered.\n\nIn 2020 covid happened. Schools shut down during lockdown, which hit us hard, but we figured it was only a temporary measure.\n\nThen not long after, the CCP arbitrarily decreed that ALL private tuition, which was 98% of our clients, had to be shut down nationwide. All after-school education programmes rendered illegal. Just like that. No forewarning, no discussion, no exceptions.\n\nThe company basically folded overnight. Multimillion dollar evaluation straight to nothing. Mass layoffs as they had to fire 80% of the workforce. With us being relatively highly paid contractors, they certainly couldn't afford to keep us on.\n\nMy wife and I now have tens of thousands of completely worthless stocks in a company that still technically exists, but is basically just completing contracts before it winds down for good. They will never be worth antyhing. There was no pivot; our products were tailored specifically for after-school programmes and the private education industry. \n\nThe amount of blood, sweat, and tears we poured into that work, just rendered pointless overnight because the CCP were trying to save face (the decree was their way of tackling education inequality, but rich people now just hire English-speaking \"maids\" and \"gardeners\" to give their children private English lessons anyway).\n\nBut worse than that, Chinese kids and parents no longer have access to the educational content and software we designed specifically because the Chinese public school English programmes are completely outdated trash. Harming an entire generation of children just to save face - classic China.\n\nThe whole thing has left me completely disillusioned with, well, everything to do with China quite honestly.\n\nI loved my time living there and would not trade it for anything.

It's not like 18 years ago it was a pristine pier - 18 years ago it was already pretty ropey.\n\nMost recently, it changed hands a bunch of times in the 60s and 70s as people bought it but couldn't afford the repair/maintenance costs to keep it running. Then it was closed because of safety concerns. I remember a story of a trust that bought the pier for a hundred pounds, but the council needed them to spend hundreds of thousands of pounds on repairs before they were allowed to open it.\n\nThere was a big storm in the late 80s (anyone else remember the gale? My main memory of it was the carpets bulging in our house from all the wind), which broke bits off the pier. During the 90s, which is when it comes into my memory, there were various trusts and foundations pledging to repair the pier (including the National Lottery), but it was going to cost millions and I think the Palace Pier owners were claiming it was unfair that their competition was getting loads of free cash.\n\nThen in 2003 somebody set fire to it (I don't think they ever found out who, but I might be wrong there). I was working on Russell Square during my gap year between college and uni, and we smelled the fire from the office. Ended up having my lunch break while watching the pier burn, very surreal. That got the pier back into the news again. I think there was another arson attack a couple of years later, and every storm that came along ruined it even more. I remember around 2008-09, just before I moved from the UK, you'd quite often see bits of the pier washed up on the beach.\n\nSo while people bickered over what should be done with it (Chris Eubank briefly expressed an interest in buying it, but I think he was really just humblebragging about how rich he was), it fell further into disrepair due to the fire damage and no repairs or maintenance taking place. Piers tend to need quite a lot of maintenance because the constant battering of saltwater accumulates and damages the foundations after a while, and the West Pier had basically been left to rot for decades at this point.\n\nAt this point what's left of the pier isn't salvageable, as far as I know. And it'd cost money to safely remove, so they've just left it to rot. My mum told me there was some discussion after the i360 was built for a new pier to be put up on the same site, but basically they decided it's so fucked it's just impossible to do anything with it at this point.\n\nOh, and I had to pause the movie to make sure I was going crazy, but a couple of weeks ago I watched the Michelle Yeoh movie *Everything Everywhere All at Once* (fantastic movie btw), and in [one of the 'travelling' montages (no spoilers) the bloody West Pier suddenly appears](https://imgur.com/7A5ZFOG). I recognised it immediately. My wife (not from Brighton) thought I was going crazy, but it's absolutely unmistakeable.\n\nI think it's more interesting as a wreck, to be honest. I like it as part of the lore of my hometown. Even if they were to restore it, I'm not sure it would serve any purpose that would rationalise the amount of money it would cost to keep it open and maintained. It's an interesting bit of history but at this point it's not worth resurrecting.\n\n(Disclaimer: I'm not a West Pier expert or anything, some of this info might be inaccurate.

You don't have a complete picture, and asking questions is absolutely the right thing to do. There are loads of really helpful answers in this thread. In particular I recommend reading up about chromatic passing chords and how they tend to function - it seems the root of your confusion may be that you see them as equivalent to borrowed chords (which they aren't; they serve a completely different musical function).\n\nHe could have phrased it more gently, sure. But again, please understand... some of us who spend time here helpfully answering newbie questions, we're human. And when you're having to constantly explain similar concepts (in particular \"music theory is not a set of rigid rules\"), sometimes the frustration can come through. I have often had to make liberal use of the backspace key here when trying to explain something to someone who is not particularly receptive to being told how they've misunderstood something, because it can be difficult not to sound like a bit of a dick when you're explaining why somebody's instincts - no matter how they're informed - are dead wrong.\n\nWe're not professional teachers, we're volunteering our time and what we know to help others. Like I said, the nature of your question revealed that you're still learning a lot of the important concepts - it wasn't out of order for him to assume that you're fairly new to theory.\n\nWe are all learning, we're just at different stages of our journey. I know people don't generally like being reminded of it, but somebody pointing out that you're at an earlier stage is not necessarily rude or projecting insecurity. 8 Bit Music Theory is a fantastic channel but he does get onto some quite advanced stuff; I'd look at it as a reminder of the dangers of running before you learn how to walk!\n\nI posted a response to you elsewhere in the thread with more details about chromatic passing chords, hope you find it helpful.", "created_utc": "1665878056.0", "edited": "1665885437.0", "id": "ishah3o", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_y4xuj3", "parent_id": "t1_ish7t57", "score": "4", "subreddit": "musictheory", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qrjj"}, {"author": "kinggimped", "body": "Yes, you're wrong to think this way. No, it doesn't necessarily mean that you're borrowing from a minor mode. It just means that you have a flat iii diminished chord as part of the progression. In this case, it's a chromatic passing chord. Don't confuse borrowed chords with passing chords; they're not the same thing and do not serve the same function musically.\n\n**The aim of any passing chord is to bridge the gap between the two chords surrounding it**. Forget key signatures and modes for a second and look at the *progression* and *context* of that biii\u00b0:\n\niii | biii\u00b0 | ii\n\n(Bm7 | Bbo7 | Am11)\n\nThe smoothness of that chromatically descending line provides a satisfying bridge between the iii and ii. The harmony is contextual.\n\nSo this is a chromatic passing chord. By their very nature, they are not part of the harmonised scale (hence the use of the term \"chromatic\", a word that comes from the ancient Greek word meaning \"colour\", because that's the effect a non-diatonic chord gives). Don't think of the chord as as not being \"part of the scale\", or being \"borrowed from a mode\".\n\nDon't come at it from a purely technical, theory-based standpoint. Try to look at it from the point of view of bridging the gap between the two surrounding chords using a chromatically descending bass and clever voice leading.\n\nMusic isn't mathematics, you can't apply rigid rules to it and get a 100% correct \"answer\". It sounds good to you because chromatic passing chords are a fairly common compositional trope in western music. Your ear is attuned to it and recognises it as such.\n\nElton John, Radiohead, David Bowie, the Beatles, Ben Folds... their music is littered with chromatic passing chords. When writing those songs it's doubtful they looked at it from a theory point of view at all, or thought \"oh god, what am I doing? This chord isn't in the key at all\". You'll also find them all over jazz music. It's simply wanted a smoother transition to get from one chord to another, and a chromatic passing chord is the best solution in this case.\n\nEdit: Maybe this will make it clearer: as an experiment, try omitting the passing chord:\n\nCmaj7 C6#4 | Cmaj7 C6#4 | Bm7 | Am11 D7\n\nCan you hear how \"unbridged\" and disjointed that transition from iii to ii sounds? How the harmonic shift loses the \"smoothness\" of the original? How much of the extra harmonic colour and nuance is lost compared with the original sequence that includes the passing chord?\n\nThere are other ways of bridging this gap, certainly - even wholly diatonic ways. For example, vi (Em7) could have been used in place of the Bbo7 - but that doesn't have the same \"seamless\" feel of Kondo's compositional choice, nor does it have the same clever voice leading or ever-so-slightly spicy chromaticism.\n\nThat chromatic passing chord creates a \"gradient\" between the iii and the ii and links them together. *That* is its purpose, and *that* is the key function of a chromatic passing chord. It may not be part of the harmonic function that you've learned so far, but it is undeniably serving an important harmonic function nonetheless *in this context*.", "created_utc": "1665877003.0", "edited": "1665922036.0", "id": "ish863j", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_y4xuj3", "parent_id": "t1_isgzqcd", "score": "10", "subreddit": "musictheory", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qrjj"}, {"author": "kinggimped", "body": "It came across as a little stark to me but bear in mind that questions like this get asked a LOT here and the point /u/Jongtr is trying to make is probably the most common slip-up for music theory beginners we see here.

To me, it seems like you were being reminded that while you are beginning to understand the *framework* of harmonic function, you have to be more musically open-minded when you actually apply that knowledge in practice.\n\nThis guy is taking the time to write informative answers for you, answering your specific queries in detail. I really wouldn't get too hung up on whether you parsed it as insulting. It's the information that should matter, and he/she is giving you the information you need to answer your question.\n\n\"Why doesn't it sound completely dissonant and wrong\" is a complex question to answer. As they said, music informs theory, not the other way around. The more you study music, the more you notice it. You can use theory to break something apart and analyse it, but if you're just taking a single vertical splice from a piece of music (in this case, a chromatic passing chord) and assuming it should sound \"wrong\" because it's a non-diatonic chord, it's one of those \"can't see the woods for the trees\" situations.

But when the temporary I is unstable - as a diminished chord always is - it doesn't have the same resolving effect, it still sounds unfinished.\n\nYou can't satisfyingly resolve to a chord as unstable as a diminished chord. You can, however, use diminished chords to set up a satisfying resolution. There are many uses for diminished chords, but using them to resolve a secondary dominant isn't really one of them.\n\nBut that doesn't mean you can't *try* to use a secondary dominant to resolve to a diminished chord in your composition. You can do whatever you want!

The tech tree is pretty linear, the multiplayer seems tacked-on (you can't even reinforce your ally with units during a battle, so why bother teaming up at all?), and the AI is even worse than Civ's AI (which is saying something).\n\nCompared with Civ 6 it's decent and a nice change to the format; compared with Civ 6 + DLCs, it's kinda underwhelming because of the comparative lack of game mechanics and polish.\n\nI haven't really played it properly since the first big patch, so they might have made a bunch of improvements by now, but I don't think it's ever going to unseat Civ as king of the 4X games. Still, I reckon it's a really good effort. It's nice to have a little variety, at least, since there isn't really any other direct competitor to the Civilization franchise.\n\nI also kinda feel like the devs promised to keep improving and improving it, and so far all I've really seen is fairly lacklustre balance patches. They seem to have focused more on the paid DLC rather than the core game, which might make them more money but it's pretty dumb to alienate a playerbase who can easily just go back to playing Civ.\n\nIMO it's actually quite a good place to start for people who want to dip their toes into a 4X game but are put off by the learning curve of Civ. Humankind actually teaches you a lot of the basic Civ mechanics (they're slightly different, but familiar enough that one informs the other), but with far fewer systems going on at once it's probably a better primer for people not used to the genre. That's just my opinion, though.\n\n[Here's a link to my more detailed Steam review for it, if that's any help.](https://steamcommunity.com/id/facialist/recommended/1124300?snr=1_5_9__402)", "created_utc": "1660180624.0", "edited": "1660180962.0", "id": "ijssdb4", "is_submitter": "True", "link_id": "t3_wkreie", "parent_id": "t1_ijsqm0v", "score": "2", "subreddit": "civ", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rk3b"}, {"author": "kinggimped", "body": "Yes, that's pretty much how I see it as well.

As usual with music theory, there aren't any cast-iron \"rules\" that tell you how you should modulate to a minor tonal centre - music theory is a way of *explaining what we know works*, it's not a ruleset.\n\nSo while everything I wrote above \"works\", there are plenty of other ways to achieve the same result. My advice would be to experiment and play around and find something that sounds good *within the context of your composition*.\n\nYou said in OP that you're looking for Bach-like modulations - so listen to and parse those moments from some of the Bach (or other baroque) pieces that you're talking about, and extrapolate how he did it.\n\nBach used a lot of chromatic secondary dominants to get to the relative minor (my penultimate suggestion) - for example he'd use C | E (or E7) | Am. In this case E (or E7) is the V (or V7) of vi. By using V/vi (E) instead of iii (Em) you get that leading tone quality of the G#, which creates tension that wants to resolve to Am.\n\nThis also creates that satisfying chromatic voice leading of G (5th of C) to G# (3rd of E) to A (tonic of Am). Or you could go the other way for a non-chromatic descending run that includes the dominant 7th of V/vi for extra tension/resolution, i.e. E (3rd of C) to D (7th of E7) to C (3rd of Am).\n\ntl;dr: there are lots of ways to do this", "created_utc": "1660092540.0", "edited": "1660096384.0", "id": "ijnnrkx", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_wkihrv", "parent_id": "t1_ijnlyjx", "score": "3", "subreddit": "musictheory", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qrjj"}, {"author": "kinggimped", "body": "There's a bunch of ways and really it depends on context what's going to work best.\n\nThe simplest way is simply to go from playing I to i (the parallel minor), with no preparation, and then just go from your new tonal centre. For example: C | Cm\n\nThis can sound jarring sometimes, so a pivot chord can be used. For example, using vii\u00b0 to get to the parallel minor, though for a smooth transition you'll want to dip your toes in the water with some chords from your new key. For example: C | Fm | B\u00b0 | Cm (Fm being iv in Cm)\n\nYou could also use a deceptive cadence (V-VI), for example: C | G | Abmaj7 | D\u00b07 | Cm (the movement from G to Abmaj7 is V-VI in Cm)\n\nYou can also just pivot to a new minor key by introducing the V of the new tonal centre and resolving to your new i, whatever it is. If the new V sounds too out of place you can find better ways to work towards it. For example: C | Eb7 | Abm, or C | F | Bb7 | Ebm\n\nIt's pretty easy to modulate to the relative minor of whatever major key you're in, just use a pivot chord. Use inversions for better bass voice leading.

All we had to do was come along tomorrow morning and attend this seminar for like an hour. Alarms going off already but he was so polite and sweet that we ended up chatting to him and giving him the 2 dollars.\n\nNext day we go to the sales thing, lots of people there. Some really charismatic Fijian dude did a presentation about how Wyndham works - basically you pay a lump sum that gives you a number of points that refresh every year. These points can be used to stay at any Wyndham resort around the world. Not just hotels, but serviced apartments. The fancier the place, the more points it cost. Basically the sales pitch was \"never pay for holiday accommodation again\". After the long ass presentation we were taken off to the next room where people were divided up, then the high pressure sales began.\n\nMy wife and I were actually considering it, because at the time we traveled a lot. It seemed like an ok deal, pay one lump sum and then just pay annual maintenance rates after that. But we were adamant that we should both be very careful, because this entire thing up to this point was the epitome of \"too good to be true\". We told them we needed some time to think about it and would get back to them later, but they were adamant that we make a decision now, or the deal was off the table.\n\nI said that if we were going to lay down that much money then we'd have to at least sample their hospitality, so how about they give us a free lunch at the resort to think about it? They called over their manager, a smug white woman who was the only non-Fijian on the staff, who said she'd give us an extra 20,000 points a year if we signed up there and then.\n\nWe said nah, we're hungry, we want to eat before making a big decision like that. But we said we were interested (we genuinely were). She started filling this bag with all kinds of free merch - tshirts, sun lotion, hats, hand towels... We said we were hungry, they'd kept us there from 11am and it was now nearly 1pm and we needed to eat, whether on their resort or not. I'd basically already got up and started walking out when they finally relented and gave us a voucher for a free lunch.\n\nWe went down to the outdoor restaurant at the resort and ordered the most expensive things on the lunch menu. Food was decent. Then we went back and we were the only couple remaining. They gave us the gold star treatment. The Karen offered us a further 10,000 free points every year if we signed up, on top of the 20,000 she'd offered earlier. She said there was a 7-day cooling off period which would totally cancel everything if we changed our mind. We signed up. We took all the free shit home, including the tour tickets and the bags of merch. They also threw in a $200 meal voucher to use at this group of restaurants in a nearby resort.\n\nLater on we got back to our hotel and googled Wyndham resorts and from about 15 minutes of research discovered it was basically a scam - you buy the points and the more points you have the more maintenance fees you pay every year. Except those maintenance fees go up every year. There's a huge black market of people trying to sell their points for cents on the dollar because the upkeep on them is just too much. Hundreds of horror stories about people going broke because they couldn't afford the fees and they'd send aggressive collections squads out as soon as a single payment was missed.\n\nThe manager giving us 30k extra points a year didn't benefit us, it just meant we'd be paying maintenance fees every year on 30k more points.\n\nYou can't reduce your points - you can gift them to others or pass them onto your children, but once you sign up you're locked in basically for life.\n\nAlso apparently the quality of the resorts varies hugely, and from what we read the quality of the resorts in the USA in particular is dire.\n\nEdit: oh, I forgot to mention the worst thing of all - when you stay at any Wyndham resort they force you to attend ANOTHER seminar which is designed to encourage you to \"level up\" and buy more points. There were so many stories of people who used their points to stay at resorts but basically had to write off the first day of their stay because they'd be tied up in high pressure sales seminars.\n\nWe emailed the very friendly sales rep (literally about an hour after we'd seen her) and said we wanted to cancel everything. We'd done what they were obviously trying to stop us from doing by keeping us in a wifi-less room for hours - understood the true nature of the deal. We wanted out and they were legally required to do that.\n\nNext day we get a curt response (what happened to their friendliness?) and confirmation that everything had been cancelled. We kept all the free stuff - I still use the bag for my dog's toys. The tour was really good, we had a lovely time and it was definitely worth a dollar each plus 2 or so hours of our time. We came out on top, but if we hadn't done that reseaech immediately after getting back to the hotel we would have ended up being absolutely shafted.\n\nThe next day we took the $200 and got one of those crazy 4-tiered seafood platters and munched on delicious crustaceans while celebrating the rare fact that we managed to outscam the scammers.\n\nFuck you and thanks, Wyndham!", "created_utc": "1659994226.0", "edited": "1659996396.0", "id": "ijhus5f", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_wjellk", "parent_id": "t1_ijh8lmr", "score": "2", "subreddit": "LifeProTips", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s5oq"}, {"author": "kinggimped", "body": "What a handsome lad.

A conservative's worst nightmare is going from the group that benefits, to the everyone else. They're terrified of losing their privilege, so they make themselves out to be perpetual victims.

From as young as 4 years old, every day kids endure cruel, brutal physical training where trainers force them to contort their bodies into excruciatingly painful and unnatural positions. Hardcore traditional training regimens for nearly every waking hour. They're threatened or beaten if they complain or even show signs of discomfort. If injured - which happens appallingly often - the hospital bills come from their own meagre income, keeping them dependent on their handlers. \n\nNo breaks. No playing. Paltry meals - can't be a contortionist if you're overweight, right? They take the abuse until they can get it right every time (just like you see in this video!), and then they move to the next feat.\n\nThey're little more than performing endentured servants. Child trafficking, group suicides, and sexual abuse are rife. Many children run away, but when found by police they are delivered straight back to the circus owners and endure savage beatings as punishment. When they become adults they either become trainers and are recycled back into the cycle of cruelty, or they're abandoned with little education or life skills beyond acrobatic skills, many of which they can no longer do because their bodies are broken from their torturous training.\n\nSo, no. I don't really agree that \"this deserves to be seen and admired\". The ends (neat party tricks to make money for their cruel handlers) don't justify the means (robbing children of their childhood and torturing them daily).\n\nChild acrobats are just another Chinese tradition with a human cost that far outweighs what you get out of it.

The only defence of these practices is that they're \"traditional\", which in my opinion doesn't automatically give you permission to torture children, women, or animals just so you can recreate stuff performed by fuckwits of the past.\n\nBehind every video like this out of China there's a history of cruelty and child abuse/exploitation.

Each athletic event is a very specific skillset. Most events are about individual skill and effort and are generally over quite quickly. It's not that women's and men's events are closer to each other in popularity, it's more that events are scheduled throughout the day and you'd have to be a particularly dedicated misogynist to look away whenever the girls are on. Athletics tends to be more about tight finishes and continually heightening the skill ceiling.\n\nWomen's tennis is an interesting contrast to the men's game: as an individual sport, the slower overall pace and lack of power (relative to the men) means that women's tennis plays very differently, and in many ways is more watchable. The ball moves slower, rallies are longer, there is a greater emphasis on touch, accuracy, and finesse than in the men's game (even though personally I would argue that there is more skill/touch in the men's game because they're dealing with higher ball speeds). I honestly love women's tennis; I just wish the girls could go for 5 sets.\n\nBut when it comes to football, there are [many examples](https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/6881715/manchester-united-women-beaten-9-0-by-salford-youth-team-triggers-vile-sexist-abuse-on-twitter/) of [local boys' youth teams](https://www.thelocal.se/20130116/45646/) beating [national women's teams](https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/australian-women-s-national-team-lose-70-to-team-of-15yearold-boys-a3257266.html) - and not just beating them, but *[absolutely mullering them](https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/13733060/gremio-men-team-brazil-women-national-6-0/)*. Essentially a bunch of *children*, not yet physically matured, many of whom share the same postcode, easily beating their country's top flite women's national team.\n\nThing is, to anyone who has actually watched any amount of men's and women's football, those results are not surprising in the least. There is a HUGE gulf in quality, pace, and overall skill between men and women's football. That has a massive effect on the overall entertainment value of each game, and that is reflected in their relative popularity. With the fairly ridiculous access we have to men's football these days - not just in our own country but from leagues all over the world - most people would simply rather watch a *noticeably* higher standard of football, and watch/go to a game with a capacity crowd. The women's game doesn't supply that in the way the men's sport does.\n\nMaybe, if you didin't grow up watching a lot of football, that gulf is harder to see. In that case, it would seem more unfair that women's football doesn't get the attention/investment the men's game does. In the same way that I, as someone who doesn't drink much wine, wouldn't reliably be able to tell the difference between a \u00a320 and a \u00a3200 bottle of wine. I can see that.\n\nI'm 100% all for women's sports but I don't think people should be guilted into watching them or be passive-aggressively accused of misogyny because they have no interest in watching women's football. Personally I love sports and when I'm going to spend 90 minutes watching a football match, for me first and foremost it's about the standard.\n\nSpeaking for myself, it's not that I \"don't like women's football\". I think it's great that it's becoming more popular. Women's cricket, too. Girls need sporting idols just like boys do, and it's bullshit that boys are so strongly encouraged to play sports at school compared with girls. But in the end, for me, sports are about entertainment. There is a completely different vibe to women's football, and to people who have watched professional football all their lives, it just falls short in a lot of areas.\n\nWhen I watch sports, I want to see the absolute highest level of athletes doing things I could never do. [You don't get goals like this in women's football.](https://youtu.be/A6IkT3PcAUE?t=542) [You don't get catches like this in women's cricket.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7GqCq61Y_E) Over a century of intense competition in these sports has gradually turned male athletes into freaks. Women's professional football is still in its infancy in comparison. Same sport, different ball game.\n\nThere are things that can be done to make women's football more popular, but there seems to be a lot of just throwing the blame on men being too misogynistic to watch the women's sports. I don't think that helps anybody.

You can reinterpret that as a minor 7 flat 5 chord (C#m\u266d5 is C# E G B also), which are quite commonly seen in jazz.", "created_utc": "1653871476.0", "edited": "1653917055.0", "id": "iahn54q", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_v0itsg", "parent_id": "t1_iaharja", "score": "3", "subreddit": "musictheory", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qrjj"}, {"author": "kinggimped", "body": "Because I'm terrified of failure", "created_utc": "1653702560.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ia9ko7y", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_uyuqc2", "parent_id": "t3_uyuqc2", "score": "1", "subreddit": "WeAreTheMusicMakers", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qmah"}, {"author": "kinggimped", "body": "If you guys think this is cool, you'd probably really like rugby union.", "created_utc": "1653616254.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ia54rjh", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_uy7wrk", "parent_id": "t3_uy7wrk", "score": "0", "subreddit": "nonononoyes", "subreddit_id": "t5_2xp2p"}, {"author": "kinggimped", "body": "Cultural genocide?

Also especially from the looks of your left hand and the way you bounce your right wrist incessantly on repeated notes, there's a whole heap of work to be done on your technique. By running before you can walk you're potentially hampering your development in the future and getting into all manner of bad habits, which can be tough to break out of. The lack of technique is especially apparent in the section starting at 0:44, which sounds disjointed and messy, since your hands can't keep up because you're warping them into shapes to hit the notes without considering what notes follow.\n\nDon't get me wrong - this is really good for 2 months and it's clear you've worked hard at it. You should absolutely feel proud of yourself. But this is just a classic example of starting with a song that perhaps you love, but you're not really ready for yet. This is all constructive criticism, which is what I'm assuming you're trying to elicit with this post. You've been getting a lot of compliments here and you do deserve them, but very few people are actually giving you any helpful advice to help you improve further.\n\nI would definitely recommend trying some [Clementi piano sonatinas](https://www.amazon.com/Clementi-Sonatinas-Schirmers-Library-Classics/dp/0793525691/ref=sr_1_2?keywords=clementi+piano+sonatinas&qid=1651532226&sprefix=clementi+piano+son%2Caps%2C319&sr=8-2) or [Mozart piano sonatas](https://www.amazon.com/Mozart-19-Sonatas-Complete-Schirmers/dp/0793526019/ref=sr_1_4?crid=1J7YNZXYP46NR&keywords=mozart+piano+sonatas&qid=1651532242&sprefix=mozart+piano+sonata%2Caps%2C249&sr=8-4) and really going to town on them. Don't just learn to play the notes, learn to play the *pieces*. They're mostly easier pieces (particularly Clementi) than La Campanella, but you'll find that you'll be able to improve your technique and inject a lot more performance into a simpler piece than a harder one. Focus intensely on the parts you find difficult. For example, beginners usually struggle with the movement of [scales and octave leaps](https://youtu.be/0_Ksi2qmW0A?t=13). So focusing on things like tucking your thumb under early and smooth horizontal wrist movement during scalic passages, or getting a feel for how far to stretch your hand to reach an octave, these are super important things to practice early on because they're pretty common piano tropes and are going to help you a lot in the future.\n\nGetting a feel for the kinds of scalic movement, alberti bass, sequences etc. from those piano sonatas will give you a lot of help going forward. There's less rubato (loose tempo) in music from the classical period so it'll help you learn to play in time. This is basically learning the rules before you start to break them; there's a good reason why they're a mainstay for piano teachers teaching beginners, and I feel like they would help you a lot.\n\nMy advice would be:\n\n- focus on smooth playing, with clearer phrasing (think about how you would sing a melody line, and try to reproduce that)\n- focus on hand shape and finger technique. Your wrists should not bounce up and down like that. Use your first knuckle as a pivot, and your second knuckle as a lever. Angle the wrist to help with shifting your hand, but your wrists should stay fairly level and move horizontally, not vertically. My old piano teacher would have been rapping my wrists with a wooden ruler if she'd seen me bouncing like that, be glad she's not there hovering over you\n- take note of dynamics and try to create an audible, tangible range between the quiet, loud, and inbetween passages\n- practice with a metronome. If you keep falling behind, then slow it down a few bpm and try again. Keep practicing until you can play it smoothly, *then* ramp up the speed to the right tempo. It's a lot better to play slowly and smoothly, than quickly and erratically/unevenly. If you can play something slow, you can play it fast - it just takes a little time and practice to get your speed up\n- learn how to use the sustain pedal (and if you don't have one, get one - it's a very important element of playing the piano)\n- get your hand accustomed to chord shapes, learn your scales. The unsureness before you played that last chord is telling that you're mostly OK with playing one note at a time in each hand, but chords are still a little terrifying. It's a hurdle to beginners but not one that is hard to clear - again, this is hand positioning and fingering stuff\n- if possible, find a teacher to guide you through some of the really important stuff and help you avoid forming bad habits. They'll be especially helpful with hand/finger positioning and technique. YouTube and the wealth of resources available these days are amazing and I wish I'd had all of it back when I was learning the piano, but there really is no substitute for having a trained pianist correcting you as you go and helping you find ways to navigate the harder stuff that would not occur to a beginner (e.g. your hand positioning in the section starting 0:44)\n\nWishing you the best of luck in your journey!", "created_utc": "1651532275.0", "edited": "1651566664.0", "id": "i7379pf", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_ugsuhr", "parent_id": "t3_ugsuhr", "score": "67", "subreddit": "piano", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qnw8"}, {"author": "kinggimped", "body": "Some typos and inconsistencies in your menu, feel free to PM me the doc and I'll make the edits for you! \u52a0\u6cb9~", "created_utc": "1651387688.0", "edited": "False", "id": "i6vo45v", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_ufhsrb", "parent_id": "t3_ufhsrb", "score": "5", "subreddit": "brighton", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qprp"}, {"author": "kinggimped", "body": "This is great, thank you for making this!", "created_utc": "1651386220.0", "edited": "False", "id": "i6vmadq", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_ufkw6j", "parent_id": "t3_ufkw6j", "score": "2", "subreddit": "DelugeUsers", "subreddit_id": "t5_9gf0t"}, {"author": "kinggimped", "body": "It's rare that somebody perfectly crystallises something I've felt my entire life but never really been able to put into words succinctly.\n\nThis is one of those times.

Don't see the locking as censorship, because it's not. It's intended as a way to keep that kind of content collated in fewer places so that it's not the only content visible on the subreddit, all the time. I know there's not much else to talk about at the moment but what they're doing is more along the lines of *housekeeping* than censorship. I know people don't like having their posts locked etc. but you have to understand, this is an unprecedented state of affairs for the subreddit and the amount of bad faith posters who are just trying to rile people up or stoke anti-China sentiment is fucking absurd right now.

Immediately jumping to \"the new mods are destroying the subreddit\" is really reactionary and over the top.\n\nI'm not going to look into what's going on because I'm not in charge of the subreddit any more.

I spent so many hours fostering this community and doing shit for /r/shanghai, honestly you don't even know. The amount of blood, sweat, and tears I've poured into this place for zero appreciation or support besides from my fellow mods. That's not me bragging, it's me trying to demonstrate that this stuff isn't easy, and no matter how hard you try, you can never please all the people all the time. I'm still helping them get their bearings but only in an advisory capacity and only if they ask me (which they have been doing - they're still asking for *permission* to delete or ban people sometimes).\n\nThey are absolutely not on a power trip. It might seem that way from your limited perspective, but it's simply not the case. I might not agree with every single decision they're making, but it's not for me to say any more. It's irrelevant what I think.\n\nPlease remember that this situation is totally unprecedented, and that before I appointed the new mods it was a complete cancerous shitshow. The last mod just quit without saying anything and has still not even responded to messages I sent him to make sure he's doing OK.\n\nBeing a mod is a thankless fucking task, and as soon as you take any action to redirect the discussion you get called a Nazi or told that you're on a power trip or that you're destroying the subreddit, or whatever else. Every single thing you do is wrong in somebody's eyes, it's the polar opposite of how it \"should\" have been done or what the \"right\" thing to do is, and you're branded a piece of shit by people just for doing what you think is best in the situation. The amount of abuse I have taken over the last 10 years just for modding the subreddit - and like you said, in a very hands off way - is ridiculous. I feel guilty for having had to appoint new mods because I knew that they would end up experiencing the same thing.\n\nNo offense intended but if you don't like it, you are welcome to start your own Shanghai subreddit where everything is allowed, and I wish you the best of luck with it. If you don't like what's going on I would recommend unsubscribing.\n\nI haven't lived in Shanghai for several years now and while I have the utmost sympathy for people caught up in the ridiculous shit that is going on there right now, it would be even more of a shitshow if I decided to wade in there and start decreeing what should and shouldn't be done. Yes, I took a lax approach to moderation in the past because we were a relatively low traffic subreddit and there wasn't a draconian lockdown fucking up everybody's lives during that time. All I can tell you is that I truly believe the mods are doing the best they can to keep the subreddit a relatively pleasant place to be. It's a difficult and thankless task, and being labelled Nazis just because they deleted a couple of posts that they'd already established belonged elsewhere doesn't really help the situation at all.\n\nIf you have constructive suggestions please feel free to direct them to the mods via modmail. @ing me about it isn't the right route to go, sorry. I'm not going to weigh in right after I spent a week vetting and even interviewing new mods, spending several *hours* with them going over what the responsibilities entail and finding a consensus for the direction of the subreddit going forward, and then announcing that I will be taking a back seat and letting them do what they need to do for the sake of the subreddit.\n\nI can guarantee you, all three of the new mods are invested in keeping /r/shanghai a nice place to be for its users. They would appreciate the community's **constructive** support and help, not their vitriol. If you want to be a constructive member of the community then please by all means send them a modmail, rather than encouraging somebody with only a tangential and historical relationship to Shanghai to storm in like Xi Jinping and start giving out edicts.\n\nShit's far more complicated than \"this motherfucker's on a power trip\", dude.

I wanted the results to be a surprise. So thanks for the massive spoiler.\n\nAnd yours isn't an \"anti-covid\" stance. We're all anti-covid. None of us are siding with the disease over our own species. From reading your posts, I'd describe your \"stance\" is at best pointless recalcitrance, and at the worst just garden variety belligerent ignorance.\n\nBut you're not alone in that, and like I said, you haven't posted anything banworthy that I can see. So I'm more than happy for the community to decide.\n\nAnd yes, this group is pretty cool, I totally agree. But you should see how cool it is without loud idiots pointlessly trying to stir up hysteria during a massively stressful time.\n\nAs for \"try to provide only helpful comments\" from now on, what possible help can you give from where you are?\n\nYou don't seem like a bad guy to me, just massively misguided and the exact wrong kind of person to have around during a covid lockdown where many people are unsure of everything, including where their next meal and delivery of clean drinking water is coming from. Understand that your ranting and raving and covid denial - all the way from the far-flung snowfields of Canada, no less - is not going to help dissolve the Chinese Communist Party. It seems that your main aim is just to piss people off. In which case, I don't know why you've decided that the group you want to piss off are people going through an inhumane covid lockdown in a city on the other side of the planet from you.\n\nObviously I don't know your backstory and wouldn't presume to, but the impression you're giving off is that you've spent your whole life living in a first world democracy. I'm betting that you've never been to China, let alone Shanghai. Hell, I'd bet that you've never stepped foot in Asia. That's not to say you've lived a sheltered life, but you certainly lack perspective. Perspective that would be key in this context. So when you seek to 'educate' with your incessant rants and rambles those who are currently living or who have lived in an authoritarian communist country, of the dangers and pitfalls of authoritarianism and/or communism, we can only roll our eyes so far bud.\n\nYou comparing Trudeau to Hitler, for example - a fucking stupid comparison, by the way, you absolute numpty - doesn't really come off very effectively to people who are *literally living in a country under the rule of an extreme nationalist authoritarian ruler* - a country with no freedom of speech, press, religion, or any of the basic freedoms that you wake up every morning and take for granted, not even considering for a moment while you slather maple syrup on your breakfast what it would be like to have lived your entire life without them. It is not the rhetorical slam dunk you think it is. It's fucking *stupid*.\n\nWe actually know what it's like to live under an authoritarian dictatorship. You, on the other hand, jump reflexively to Godwin's Law as soon as your democratically elected leader says something you don't like, or institutes something for the common good that is inconvenient to you personally. There's a world - nay, a frigging *MILKY WAY GALAXY* - of difference. Learn to calibrate.\n\nAnd pick up a bloody history book sometime, there's a good chap. Because Hitler and his supporters and enablers actually used the exact same rhetorical techniques - vilifying opponents, *luegenpresse*, denial of science and distrust of established expertise, etc. - that **you** and your ilk seem so hell bent on expressing. If you're as smart and capable of self-examination as you say you are (and honestly, genuinely seem to be), maybe take this whole thing as a learning experience, because then you might actually get something positive out of it.\n\nPeople aren't trying to silence you, they're asking you to calibrate. I'm sure you have plenty of valid opinions in that raffle drum of a brain of yours, but to me your posts are ridiculous and rife with complete ignorance. The worst part of all this is that you have the incredible luxury and privilege of a free press and an open, uncensored internet - the very tools with which you could cure your ignorance and base your opinions on sound, peer-reviewed, scientific consensus. But you my friend have *chosen* to remain belligerently ignorant, because you'd rather be the guy going against the grain. That brave, thankless hero who flies against consensus because you have the inalienable right to do so. You might be a champion among your fellow right wing anti-government Joe Rogan acolyte lunatics, a brave protector of freedoms. But to most of us here you just come across as a simpleton without a shred of perspective or empathy.\n\nIf it were up to me I wouldn't ban you. I'd just politely ask you to pull your head in and have some semblance of empathy for what people are currently going through, and realise that the invective and long-disproved misinformation you're posting isn't helping anyone. But when a group of people decide to hold a vote and hundreds of people participate even on a relatively low traffic subreddit, I believe the result of that deserves to be respected. Given your ear-piercingly loud pro-democracy, pro-freedom stance, seems like that decision should suit you just fine.\n\nUnlike people living in China, you have a right to voice your opinions. But maybe, even if you are not forced to do so by the results of this poll, you could consider voicing those opinions somewhere else.\n\nHave a wonderful day.", "created_utc": "1649541058.0", "edited": "1649558022.0", "id": "i43560s", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_tzky8v", "parent_id": "t1_i4215he", "score": "6", "subreddit": "shanghai", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qyu0"}, {"author": "kinggimped", "body": "[I just responded in that thread.](https://www.reddit.com/r/shanghai/comments/tzky8v/petition_to_ban_ucleanupyourbackyard/i40nyu6/)\n\nSorry it's taking me a while to get around to stuff.

Just from reading the subtitles (artfully edited to make it seem very flattering to him), if you didn't understand the language the conversation seemed fairly natural.

No responses to direct questions. Just abandoning it and moving on to the next phrase in his arsenal as soon as there was a gap in conversation. The longer the 'conversation', the more obvious the deception became, and it became quite painful to watch.\n\nChinese people are very insular and are always genuinely surprised and appreciative of any white person who can throw out even a decent \"nihao\", let alone throw together a whole sentence (anyone who has lived in China can attest to this). So they'd lavish him with praise even though he wasn't meaningfully participating in the conversation. With some editing smoke and mirrors that focused more on the praise he received rather than the content of the 'conversations' themselves, it made him look like he'd made a lot of progress in a short time.\n\nThis particular guy sells language learning books so it's pretty much his business model to \"learn\" a new language on his YouTube channel to push more copies.

However, Whittaker's have their own premium \"artisan\" range that's a lot more expensive (like 2x the price) and has a bunch of fancy flavours, but the default stuff is great so why would you even bother.\n\nJust checked the PAK'NSAVE (NZ supermarket) ordering online: Whittaker's is $4.89 for 250g ($1.92/100g), a Dairy Milk is $5.29 for 360g ($1.46/100g).\n\nHowever, pretty every time I've been to the supermarket in recent memory, there's a \"3 bars of Whittaker's for $10\" deal. Obviously depends on where you shop since supermarket prices do vary a lot here, and I don't know how often they're actually running that deal.

No reason to save a few cents buying Cadbury's when Whittaker's is that much better (and fuck me, it really is).\n\nSimilar deal with ice cream here - nobody bothers with Wall's or whatever the equivalent is here. The NZ default cheap ice cream brand is called Tip Top, and in terms of quality I would quite confidently say it's better than a lot of premium brands in the UK I've tried. Blew me away the first time I tried it and was like \"Wait, this is the *cheap stuff*?\".\n\nDairy, chocolate, and lamb is on a different level over here. Excellent coffee, too.

Because plenty of people are still affected by people's attempts to delete something from society just because they don't personally agree with it. Just not the people with the kind of profile that Louis CK has, because some people, no matter what they do, will always have their supporters. But lesser known and up-and-coming comics absolutely have to moderate the kinds of things they can joke about more and more these days, because they fear the same kind of reprisals if somebody takes a joke they made out of context, interprets it as hateful, and turns it into a boycott campaign.\n\nSo no, cancel culture isn't \"fake\" at all, but like with anything else there are people operating in bad faith or with a clear agenda; much like how the conservative right in the US tried to cancel all rock and roll music (\"the devil's music!\"), Dungeons & Dragons, the Dixie Chicks, Jane Fonda, Gilette, the NFL, etc. (yet they're now the ones most often decrying \"cancel culture\", when what they really mean is \"I don't want to face the consequences for my words/actions\").\n\nI think what Louis CK did was absolutely an abuse of his power/influence, but people tend to look at stuff like this with zero sense of nuance. At the time, a lot of people were comparing him with Kevin Spacey, who *literally raped young boys*. They're two A-list celebrities who got caught out doing bad things, but nothing is black and white, and cancel culture campaigns prey on those who would rather see things that way.\n\nAlso, if you haven't read [Louis CK's apology](https://edition.cnn.com/2017/11/10/entertainment/louis-ck-full-statement/index.html) after the revelations went public, you should. Even thought it doesn't excuse his behaviour, it's by far the most honest, contrite, and *actually apologetic* apology to come out of the whole #MeToo thing. I lost a lot of respect for him after what he did and how he initially denied it, but gained a lot back after he actually owned up to it and took some kind of accountability.\n\nGrammies aren't about how many women you've flogged the dolphin in front of, they're not about how you define consent. Grammies are supposed to be about being awarded for the merit of the art you've created. I haven't seen *Sincerely*, but it's now on my watchlist, not so much because of the Grammy but more because of how glowingly people in this thread are talking about it.\n\nFor the record, I still think Kevin Spacey is an incredible actor and his performance in *American Beauty* still makes it one of my favourite movies. I also think he's a disgusting child rapist. He should be rotting in a prison cell for what he did, but banning all movies that feature him is an absolutely ridiculous notion.

He knows I'm a musician and decided to regift it to me rather than sell it on or let it keep gathering dust. Good friend! So far I've been playing with it whenever I get free time, and I have been having an absolute blast. It's a fantastic bit of kit, and even if I'd paid full price for it I'd still be pretty thrilled with it.\n\n[This YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQvVnhG7o2ySwMn_AvbPAIx7lnQYjJBUG) is a really good place to start.\n\nAlso check out the [Synthstrom forums](https://forums.synthstrom.com/categories/deluge-sample-packs) for free sample packs.\n\nThe official Deluge Guidebook is [here](https://synthstrom-audible-deluge.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Deluge-Guidebook-3p1.pdf). The Community Guide (more of a quick reference) is [here](https://synthstrom-audible-deluge.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Deluge-Community-Guide-3p1.pdf). Both are useful reference documents.\n\nUpdate the firmware to the latest version as soon as you get it. Check firmware by pressing SHIFT and the SELECT/SETTINGS knob (to the left of the screen). Then scroll right using the SELECT/SETTINGS knob until you see \"FIRM\" and push down on the knob. That'll show you the currently installed firmware. Current stable firmware version is v3.1.5.\n\nIf you're on an earlier version, you can download v3.1.5 [here](https://forums.synthstrom.com/discussion/3385/deluge-firmware-v3-1-5-released/). Copy the .bin file to the SD card, make sure there are no other .bin files on there, put the card back in the Deluge, then hold down SHIFT while powering it on. You'll see a spinning animation on the screen while it installs.\n\nIf there was really old firmware on there, i.e. older than 2.1, then you'll also want to download the [2.x/3.x factory SD contents](https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/synthstrom-audible-deluge/Deluge+V2p1p0+factory+card+contents.zip) (this is all the synths and presets) and replace whatever is on the memory card. Since my buddy hadn't touched his in literally years, it was still running an ancient 1.x firmware. Updating the firmware and grabbing the new factory SD contents felt like a big step (you get a BUNCH more synths, kits, and functionality with the latest firmwares - the hardware hasn't been updated but they've continued improving the software a bunch).\n\nOnly other advice I would give is how to make your own samples/multisamples from WAVs - it's really easy. Find a YouTube tutorial, or follow [this guide](https://imgur.com/a/KpiASKg).\n\nOtherwise, just have fun with it! I've been so busy with work over the last month or so but have had a few plays with it and made some fun beats, I even [posted one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWJKlR5-4Yo) on YouTube the other day, though I still suck. Still, gotta start somewhere.\n\nIt's a very intuitive bit of kit - I watched the first couple of those bootcamp videos and so far have just been playing around and experimenting with the knowledge I gained from those.

When I started learning Latin and we got to superlatives, it immediately made sense.\n\nThe comparative suffix in Latin is -ior (e.g. *fortis, fortior, fortissimus*: \"strong, stronger, strongest/very strong\").\n\nOne nice thing about Latin is that, compared with English, it is a very regular language (as Spanish is, I believe). So once you learn these things it's very easy to notice them everywhere. There are a few exceptions where you'd expect them, for example \"good\" is *bonus*, but the comparative and superlative forms are *melior* and *melius*.

Google Translate has failed you there. As an ex-classicist I recommend nobody ever uses Google Translate to directly translate English into Latin, it is extremely inaccurate. This is especially true for if you want to get a Latin tattoo.\n\nI assume Google Translate took \"very\" as meaning \"specific\" (as in, \"he's the *very* man for the job\"), and translated it to *ipsum*. That right there is the reason why you can't rely on it for translation. It is not a dictionary.\n\nAs for the reason why it's strangely difficult to find the word for 'very', Latin often uses the superlative form of an adjective to mean \"very\" (as well as \"-est\"). Since Latin is a heavily inflected language (i.e. words change in form to reflect their grammatical and syntactical context within a sentence), superlatives are formed without needing to add another word. So you don't often see a separate word for \"very\".\n\nFor example:\n\n*hic servus fortis est* = \"this slave is strong\"  \n*hic servus fortissimus est* = \"this slave is very strong\" / \"this slave is the strongest\"\n\nI guess for an individual word, Latin for \"very\" is often some form of *multus*, which really means \"many\" but can be used as an intensifier. *valde* is also used sometimes (literally \"strongly\"), as well as the fun-to-say *magnopere* (mag-nop-e-re), which means \"to a great degree\".\n\nTo answer your question though, French *tr\u00e8s* comes from Latin *trans*, which means \"across\" or \"beyond\".\n\nSpanish *muy* comes from Latin *multus*.", "created_utc": "1648545218.0", "edited": "1648760809.0", "id": "i2jkos2", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_tqc0yp", "parent_id": "t3_tqc0yp", "score": "2", "subreddit": "etymology", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qspe"}, {"author": "kinggimped", "body": "Sorry you have to deal with this, OP.

I was too young at the time to realise he was a complete sociopath. I mean, I suppose I knew on some level there was something not quite right there - rich parents, no discipline, did what he wanted, and all that - but he seemed, I don't know, he seemed mostly all right.\n\nBut looking back, he was a fucking menace.\n\nOne birthday, I organised a party at my house and invited the whole class. Back then, Super Soakers were all the rage, and I'd asked my parents for one for my birthday. They ended up buying me a no-brand version which was shit, but hey, we were pretty poor, and I was just happy to have a water gun.\n\nSo this kid comes along and brings along a [top-of-the-line Super Soaker](https://www.ebay.com/itm/234187660256). One of those ones you could pump up and shoot someone from the other side of the fucking garden. One of the ones with the backpacks you wore to give you more capacity than anyone else. It looked like one of the guns from fucking *Ghostbusters*.\n\nEveryone was in awe of his gear after he arrived. Jumping out of his parents' massive Range Rover like Rambo dismounting a fucking helicopter. Gun and backpack already strapped on, already filled with water. He'd planned ahead. Respect.\n\nI remember that he seemed a bit annoyed that we weren't going to have the water gun fight straight away. We were going to eat first, I'd open my presents (including my water gun!), and then we'd have the big battle royale.\n\nSo, after rushing through the food and the presents, everybody was pumped. Metaphorically and in most cases, literally. Teams, alliances, and non-aggression pacts were already forming as we all crowded around the single hose in our very modest back garden and filled our guns. Some of us had decent guns, some just had crappy pistols. But that wasn't the point. We just wanted to have a water fight. It was a hot day. The anticipation was palpable.\n\nThis kid, though, he just sat there on the garden wall, slowly pumping his massive Super Soaker, backpack still strapped on. Just smiling smugly, looking off into the distance. People were asking him if he wanted to team up, but he wanted to go it alone. Fair enough, we thought. He's got the right gun for it.\n\nWhen we were ready to go, battle commenced. It was mayhem. Water flying everywhere. Kids laughing and screaming. More water. More screaming. Screaming gave way to shrieking. Crying. Wailing. Far more screaming than there should have been. And not excited, 10-year-old children chasing each other screaming, this was wailing, screams of pain. Kids were on their knees, covering their eyes with their arms. Some were rolling on the ground. The noise was unforgettable.\n\nAnd in the middle of it all, there was this kid, same smug grin on his face, spraying everybody with his ridiculously massive gun, still half a tank left on his back.\n\nFucker had filled his tank with water *and pepper*. He'd emptied a whole fucking packet of ground pepper into his water tank and was *aiming for eyes*.\n\nNo emotion. No regrets. He was completely surprised when he was roundly bollocked by all the parents who were there.\n\nWater fights were banned henceforth. My shitty gun, that I'd owned for about 25 minutes, was taken away and I never saw it again.\n\ntl;dr No, don't fucking piss in it", "created_utc": "1648467589.0", "edited": "False", "id": "i2fcs1m", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_tq4b5z", "parent_id": "t1_i2f2i8u", "score": "4", "subreddit": "gifsthatkeepongiving", "subreddit_id": "t5_39ssk"}, {"author": "kinggimped", "body": "Obviously covid has had a big effect on it but I mean, [Windsor Castle alone got 1.6 million paid visitors in the 2019-20 fiscal year](https://www.statista.com/statistics/373081/uk-royal-tourism-admission-numbers-by-establishment/), Buckingham palace nearly 600k, etc. [Around 3 million admissions in all.](https://www.statista.com/statistics/373102/uk-royal-tourism-admission-numbers/) I believe 25% of that goes to the royals and 75% goes to HM treasury.\n\nYou and I might not give a shit but to countries like China, Japan, and the US they're big tourist draws because they don't have anything like it in their own countries and it's seen as a quintessentially British attraction. People might not come specifically to visit royal tourist attractions but it's definitely part of the appeal to a lot of travelers.\n\nI don't really know that much about this but a quick google also taught me that stuff like the entirety of Regent Street, Ascot Racecourse, Windsor Great Park etc. is all part of the crown estate. Also about 2 *million* acres of agricultural land.

Some Chinese people who only had a handful of English words, \"queen\" would be amongst them when they found out I was \u82f1\u56fd\u4eba.

The economics are quite complex, to be honest. But the average person has no idea and they just make assumptions without realising the ramifications.\n\nI'm not a supporter of the royal family, the entire concept is archaic and they should not be as filthy rich as they are. But economically, they are a net positive on the UK economy because of the tourism money they bring in and the income from the lands they own (the queen is technically the [country's biggest landlord](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crown_Estate)).\n\nMost people don't realise that this is the case and just see them as the posturing, privileged arseholes they are, nonces who can buy off sexual assault charges by selling off one of their Swiss chalets. They might be ambassadors for Britain, but you couldn't imagine a more out-of-touch set of twats 'representing' the country, it's all just pageantry while the proles suffer under an ever more corrupt government. It's easier for the average shitmuncher to blame the cunts wearing crowns and robes, rather than the cunts who do their best to hide their wealth and act like they're 'one of the people' when they're just as out of touch, but malignantly and maliciously so.\n\nI wish they'd fuck off because I do not give a damp shit what Prince William or Harry and their fucking wives are up to, or what the latest manufactured drama is that'll sell magazines to idiots and curtain twitchers.\n\nThe entire culture of celebrity worship is fucked from the get go, but the fact that the shitty tabloid media have this immediate laser focus on every single thing these twatbuckets say and do (or shit they just make up about them)... and then every dullard housewife runs off to buy a copy of Hello or Woman's Day or Now or Take a Break or Reveal or Closer or whatever trash bumwad publication they buy that has royals on the cover, every single sodding issue, along with a bunch of misleading clickbait headlines. A multi-million pound industry, born out of a bunch of witless hags spreading idle gossip about a handful of priviliged millionaires who have never had to work a day in their lives. And people continue to eat it up, for some bizarre reason.\n\nSo yes, fuck the royal family, ignore them and let them get on with it. But they're not the problem, they're just a handful of priviliged shits doing what priviliged shits do. The queen and the rest of the royals have demonstrated time and time again that they hold no real power or influence. Bojo wanders into Buckingham Palace and lies to the queen's face and nothing happens. The country votes against its own interests to leave the EU after a dark money-funded misinformation campaign the likes of which the country has never seen before, primarily so that wealthy conservative ministers and their even wealthier benefactors will not have to be beholden to new EU regulations on offshore accounts and hoarding wealth, and the queen does nothing. She's a ceremonial twat in a hat, a decorative figurehead, and when she dies it'll fill the headlines, there'll be retrospectives running around the clock that were loaded into the chamber years ago, and life will go on with no tangible change to the common man and woman whatsoever, except perhaps which particular inbred teutonic face is on stamps.\n\nAnd if you think Andy the Nonce is going to stop raping teenage girls, you are sorely mistaken. He's already proven that he can do it and then get away with it, why would he stop now? He'll just find a way to do it more quietly.\n\nVote out the fucking Tories who are actively damaging Britain and its reputation around the globe, and consistently fucking the poor in order to line their own pockets and close the doors behind them. We can't do shit about the royals, but if people actually voted with their brains instead of their ignorant guts then maybe the people we elect to actually represent us would be inclined to help make a better Britain instead of just using it as a way to buff their and their rich mates' offshore bank accounts.\n\nBut there's no chance of any of that happening, because narcissism and ignorance is the norm.

Sichuan cuisine isn't my favourite, but I'd eat \u8fa3\u5b50\u9e21 probably once or twice a week.\n\nSo yeah, \u8fa3\u5b50\u9e21 is eaten in Chongqing.

It's all in Russian.\" She said, \"Our schools are teaching everything in Russian at the moment. Ukrainian is, like, a language.\"\n\nSo, she said to concentrate on Russian. It's much easier to learn, you know, and wherever you go in Ukraine, you will be understood. And even if you go to other post-Soviet Union nations, like Latvia, Estonia, Lithuania, or if you go to Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, if you go to Georgia, Armenia... she said they all speak Russian, and you will be understood. So I concentrated on Russian, and, y'know--\n\n(Wife, A, chips in): It shows, how hated were they?\n\nDad: Exactly. Exactly, if that doesn't show you that they were never hated, I don't know what will.\n\nBut the point, the point is that it took me a long time to learn Russian, because I don't speak it.

I do not even want to entertain a thought of what it would have been like if Trump were still president. The US would probably be present in Ukraine, but fighting on Putin's side. Putin already has a puppet installed in Belarus - it's only a good thing for the US and for global democracy as a whole that he no longer has one inside the White House.\n\nIf anyone disagrees, fuck that.

So, yes, there are families here, there, and everywhere. And yes, they do communicate with each other and keep in touch.\n\nNow, the sad thing is that, uh, (nervous laugh) some Russians whose families are in Ukraine, they are supporters of Putin. And they believe that Ukraine is wrong, and that Ukraine are the ones who started the aggression. Only because of the false propaganda that is coming out of Russia all the time. It's a little bit like China, you know, they are not allowed to watch Ukrainian channels, whereas Ukraine has all the Russian channels open to everyone. You watch what you want, it's a free country.\n\nSo, unfortunately, although they are on both sides of the borders, I mean, they are families. And families have problems, rifts, what have you. Being in Ukraine for 17 years and living with my wife and her parents and her whole family, uh, you come out with one conclusion: Ukrainians don't hold any grudges against anybody. Even now, on our social media in Ukraine, Ukrainians are *thanking* the Russian population, for supporting them, morally.

I think perhaps I was trying to be very specific with my language to make sure things were clear, which meant it was often simpler to refer to my stepmother as \"his wife\" and my half-sister as \"his daughter\". But perhaps this also subconsciously reflects the fact that, as I explained, I don't really know them as people; rather, extensions of my family via my father.\n\nI wasn't introduced to the concept of having step-family until much later in my life. It still feels strange to me to refer to my dad's wife as \"my stepmother\", even though that's exactly what she is. It feels like, the word *mother* does not really apply to her, even though technically, that is who she is to me.\n\n> Also, P.S. EVERYONE you're related to is only through either your father or mother, whether by marriage or otherwise. ;)\n\nSure, technically. But in my situation, I feel very little direct familial connection to my dad's \"new\" family, nor my mother's \"new\" husband. I love and appreciate them all, but I'm an adult living far away and they've simply not been a part of my life. That doesn't make them less of my family, technically speaking, but I simply don't think of them in the same way. I don't mean that to sound harsh towards them, it's just how it is. I'm sure it would be different if I lived with my parents or at least nearby and visited them often, since I would have more tangible relationships with my step- and half-relatives.\n\nBut I'm the only person in my family on the continent where I live. I have my wife, I have the lovely parents- and siblings-in-laws I gained through marrying her, and I have my dog.\n\nI think perhaps a lot of this is about me and how I grew up. I think other cultures take a much more broad view of family. We weren't really like that.

I also don't know all the visa rules and what people from different countries have to go through in order to get safe passage across the border in this situation.\n\nI have seen sites that posted videos of this \"violence\" against Indians or black people, but every single video fails even to show clearly if the victim is even dark-skinned, or any hard proof that the incident took place on the border as they claim. If it's happening so frequently, how come there are no indisputable videos of the event?\n\nThere have been many negative videos that have been later revealed to be Russian misinformation, videos of events shared out of context or reported to be recent when they're years old. [Axios have an article about this exact thing](https://www.axios.com/ukraine-misinformation-videos-context-c9c13e84-7a9e-4578-8e52-6b8f34379f92.html).\n\nIt's well known at this point, especially over the past 5 years, that Russian misinformation/troll farms exist, that they are vast well-oiled machines, and they are very good at disseminating misinformation at scale. There is no doubt in my mind that this war is both an actual war and an information war. So it's very difficult to know what is the truth, what is idle gossip, and what is straight up weaponised misinformation.\n\nSo while I don't know for sure whether these reports are legit or not, what I can say for sure is that they do not fall in line with my father's experiences from the last 17 years of living in Ukraine. He has stated on here and to me several times that he has seen no preferential treatment, no racism, nothing at all. He even mentioned a couple of black guys who were nearby to where they were in the queue, and they were out in traffic helping direct the queues and keeping it orderly, and they were getting the same food and supplies from volunteers and attention from police/medics that everybody else was.\n\nHe has never experienced racism in Ukraine, despite him being dark-skinned with a big ol' middle eastern nose.

A British passport does not entitle you to a speedy escape, it just identifies you as a British citizen and grants you the freedom of travel that a British passport grants you.\n\nHis best option as far as he could see was to get his family to the Slovakian border ASAP and make his way up through Europe to stay with family in the UK.

They did not lack for food because there were volunteers continuously bringing them food and drink throughout the day. I talked more about this [this response](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t3wdna/iama_refugee_at_the_slovakiaukraine_border/hyw8je2/?context=3).\n\n> Are they staying warm? I keep reading about how cold it is and how long the wait is \ud83e\udd7a\n\nThey had the engine running throughout to keep the car warm. Dad wasn't worried about fuel running out because he had been really dilligent about filling the tank at every opportunity and had a spare 20 litre canister in the back. He talks more about that [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t3wdna/iama_refugee_at_the_slovakiaukraine_border/hyv0j6p/?context=3).\n\nIt was certanly a long wait, though. 60+ hours in the end. But he is over the border now and sleeping soundly in a Slovakian hotel as I type this :)\n\n> Are groups in different cars starting to get to know each other? Like, are people helping each other out, or just keeping to themselves?\n\nMy dad can speak more to this, and I will forward the question to him. But in general, from what he told me and what he mentioned in other responses, yes people were helping each other out. There was a general feeling of camaraderie, that everybody was in this together, everybody just had to suffer through the same. Nobody was given preferential treatment, everybody will be processed, we just have to be patient. That kind of feeling.\n\nPersonally I think this was greatly aided by the fact that there were people going up and down handing out food, supplies, medical care, etc. and there were police cars going up and down the queue day and night to make sure that everybody was OK, and everybody was safe. My dad even sent me pictures of some stalls that people had set up. People had laid out supplies for people to take, there were people making hot fresh food and coffee, that kind of thing. None of them would accept any money for it.\n\nHe didn't see anything like you might have expected - looting, stealing, fighting, people trying to push in line, etc. In 60 hours trapped in the queue, they never saw anything like that. People were frustrated, of course, but they knew that everybody else was in the same situation, they didn't blame anyone else. Except Putin, of course. Nobody wanted to be making the trip, it was just a tragic necessity.\n\n> Where will they go after reaching the border? Is his plan to head back to the UK?\n\nHe is driving all the way through Europe to Calais, then onto a ferry, then to the UK.\n\n> And if so - does he have a plan about who/where to go to? (It\u2019s one thing to visit fam in your old hometown for a weekend, another to truly move in with them for an indefinite period of time!)\n\nHis brother lives in the UK, and whenever my dad goes to the UK that's generally who he stays with.

It is romanticised in the sense that I have really only talked about positive aspects of our family and the relationships within.\n\nBut on the whole yes, my dad has found happiness with his family in Ukraine. And that's something that makes me happy.\n\nI believe from what my dad told me that A is making some videos about what he's been going through over the last week or so (escaping from Kyiv, getting back to his hometown, etc.).

I have great affection for them both.\n\nBut the thing is, I don't really *know* them. I was at university when my dad and his wife got together. Before that, I had met her, but only as a guest in our home (that's how she and my dad met - she had a teaching job lined up in the UK and needed somewhere to stay before the placement started, one of my dad's friends who knew her mentioned it to my dad, and he offered up our spare room out of kindness).\n\nBy the time I returned from university, my father and his now wife had already left for Ukraine, and our family home was gone; I had nowhere to come back to.\n\nAbout 5 years later I visited dad in Ukraine and stayed for about a month. His wife was heavily pregnant with my half-sister at the time. I'd hoped to meet her, but left for my next destination about 2 or 3 days before she popped. My stepmother has always been very pleasant to me, but I can't really overstate just how pregnant she was, she was basically immobile and I spent most of the time in Ukraine with my dad.\n\nSince then I have only met my half sister once, only for a couple of hours, when my siblings and I met up with my dad, his wife, and daughter in a pub over Christmas when we all happened to be in the UK at the same time. That was about 5 or 6 years ago now, I think that was the last time I saw my dad in person and it was only a very fleeting visit. Most of those couple of hours was spent trying not to be goaded into pointless arguments with my fuckwit older brother.\n\nI am in fairly regular contact with my dad, and very occasionally chat to his wife and daughter, but rarely directly. Nothing meaningful, just pleasantries. I ask after them when I speak to my dad.\n\nSo yeah, I don't really know them. As individual people, they're essentially strangers to me. I know what they've been up to, but I don't know what makes them tick, I don't truly know them as people. Like I said I have great affection for both of them because I know how much my dad loves them, and how much they love him. And how happy they all make each other. And so I love them for that.\n\nBut his wife is not my mother. She's closer to my age than my father's. Yes, they are related to me, but it's via my father. I live on the opposite side of the world, in the opposite hemisphere, it's not realistic for us to have a close relationship.\n\nAlso, I'm 38. I'm a full blown adult. I think I was about 21 when my dad married his wife.\n\nI'm guessing that your situation as a stepmother is not the same. I don't think you could (or should) compare the situations. If you're a stepmother living with your stepchild(ren), and they are still actual children, it's just a completely different dynamic. So basically, I don't think I'm the right person to ask about this as it relates to you as a stepmother.

The blades and the mechanism are ridiculously powerful and well made. My mum used to love showing off how she only ever needed to buy granulated sugar, because if she wanted caster or icing sugar she could just put it in the thermomix and fuck that shit up into dust with the blades for a few seconds. Blenders can't do that. Not evenly and predictably, anyway. They're not powerful enough. But the fucking Thermomix is.\n\nIt can also heat food while mixing it, and it regulates the temperature really accurately. So you can do some wacky stuff that you wouldn't be able to do easily with traditional kitchen equipment, like cook eggs sous vide, or knead dough, or make perfect smooth fruit sorbet by chucking some frozen fruit and icing sugar in and wazzing it for a couple of seconds. But you can basically cook anything in it. My mum makes fantastic curries in hers, as well as a bunch of other stuff. She's an incredibly good cook, though, and she uses it quite often.\n\nSo it's an amazing piece of kit but it costs $1000+ and they sell it in this ludicrous way that makes it seem like some kind of cult or scam. You have to sign up and attend a live session to watch somebody demo it in front of you (seriously), and then you can only buy it through them or a limited number of other suppliers. You can't just go to the store and pick one up. I don't know why they do it this way. I think it's a way of creating artificial scarcity or something.\n\nAnd since they're so expensive, if you're not going to use it regularly it's just not really worth it. It's for real kitchen enthusiasts. So people who spend that much on it have to continually talk about it to rationalise the ridiculous amount of money they just spent for an incredibly overengineered kitchen gadget (like my mum and the sugar thing I mentioned), which makes some people think it's some kind of weird cult or MLM type thing.\n\nIt isn't, it's legit.

There are actually a few reasons and I don't really want to get too deep into it because it involves, well, promises between family members that weren't kept. Basically there was a spoken agreement that my (wealthy) grandparents would pay for our tuition, which was later never honoured, but by that point my parents were really reticent to pull us out of private school and chuck us into a state school because we knew from experience that the state schools nearby were absolute dog shit.\n\nSpeaking for myself, I sat every single scholarship exam and applied for every single thing I could to make it cheaper. I had a continuation scholarship around age 11, which meant most of my remaining secondary education was paid for by the college I'd won a place at. A year later I also won an assisted place (basically a discount to your school fees based on how much your parents earn, which wasn't much therefore the discount was huge), and at 13 I got an academic scholarship (not the top tier one, but still another hefty chunk off fees nonetheless). I also had a music scholarship so I got free music lessons and another bit of money knocked off my school fees. So I essentially went to school mostly for free from the ages of 11 to 18.\n\nMy mother also worked an admin job at the college where my brother and I went to for several years, so she got a small discount on fees, too.\n\nMy brother was expelled from, well, every school he ever attended, less said about that the better. But basically they wasted a bunch of money on private schools for him for a few years but after getting expelled from the first 2 he went to state schools, before he was expelled from those too.\n\nMy sister, you know, I'm not sure. I think she may have benefited from some government grants and an assisted place type thing, but it's been a long time since I've thought about a lot of this.\n\nSo basically, we didn't pay full price because my mum and dad took every single opportunity to save money but try to keep us in private education.

They can't just let everybody through. My dad is not so much pissed off about it than he is just exhausted. It's a necessity and everyone seems to realise that. Nobody's being fast tracked to the front because they're rich or important or have bribed the officials. Everybody has to wait their turn. They're processing as fast as they can. It's a simple mathematical equation, really. It's *thousands* of cars trying to get through a single checkpoint.\n\nHowever, there are police cars driving up and down constantly to make sure everybody is OK, everybody is safe, and nobody is trying to jump the queue (dad says he hasn't seen anyone try, there's very much a spirit of \"we're all in this together\" going on).\n\nThere are volunteers - mostly people who live locally - going up and down the queues of cars with hot and cold food, water, blankets, clothes, tissues, batteries, nappies, anything they can do to help.

There aren't many black or brown people here. But when they see them, they don't stare, they don't think \"ah, right, they're foreigners\".

He has never experienced any racism while living there. Obviously this is all anecdotal and I don't agree with my dad that there is 'no racism in Ukraine', because sadly there is racism everywhere. But when he says he's never experienced any racism or anti-foreigner sentiment in all the time he's lived there, I'm inclined to believe him.\n\nI also read those reports about white Ukrainians being given preferential treatment at the border, but I don't recall if it was from a reputable source.

While we don't talk as much as I'd like, I do reach out to her now and again (often just sending her an \"I love you\" message on WhatsApp), and occasionally we have a longer chat and catch up. She doesn't like to share too much about her life with me, so it's usually me making the effort to keep in touch, and I am not always the best at that either. I am an absent uncle to her daughter, though I do try to make sure to buy her little gifts on her birthday and for Christmas just to remind her that I exist as she grows up (although I doubt she could pick me out of a crowd, I haven't lived in the UK for her entire life and have only even met her a handful of times).\n\nI do wish my sister and I were closer, but relationships are relationships and being on opposite sides (and hemispheres) of the world makes maintaining closeness difficult. On the (extremely rare) occasion that I wake up to see a message from her, it makes my whole day that much brighter. I love her dearly and want only the best for her, and if that includes her keeping me at arm's length, I respect that.\n\nI do not have a relationship of any kind with my older brother, and never have.

Actually, both my mum and dad were both incredible cooks, I was very lucky in that regard (and although I didn't inherit their talent for it, I am a huge appreciator of good food to this day).\n\nEven before he bought the *dacha*, he kept rabbits in a garage lock-up close to his house that his father-in-law owned but didn't really use. I've seen the little garage when I visited - it's tiny. About big enough to store a motorbike or a couple of bicycles. But they put some hutches in there, enough for maybe 10-12 rabbits. They built some hutches with some spare wood and chicken wire, got some baby rabbits, raised them, slaughtered them. Gave some to friends and family and ate the rest.\n\nMy dad bought a cafe in his town, got it to a point where it basically ran itself. Then he bought a restaurant in the next town, and did the same thing there. Things were going really well, then covid hit. He sold both businesses. But he kept the industrial fridges and freezers from his restaurant, and took them to the *dacha*.\n\nThen he decided he would start raising ducks. He loves animals, he buys the ducklings for next to nothing at an animal market. They follow him around the *dacha* and basically just hang out. And the farmers in the neighbouring land, who of course all know my dad because he's the only foreigner around, they give him excess grain and feed for the ducks. He pays them in vegetables, beer, and friendship. When the ducks grow big enough, my dad slaughters them and stores them in the freezers. And then they eat duck. Lots of duck. He gives some away to his neighbours, to his family and friends, and stores the rest and slowly works his way through it.\n\nHe says that the hardest part is the day he has to slaughter all the ducks. My dad is not a squeamish person at all, but he has to look away when he slits their throats because he just loves the little fuckers, and they're just so cute.\n\nThen the next season, he goes to the animal market, buys a whole new set of ducklings, and starts all over again.\n\nHe loves it. He has found a lot of peace and pleasure in gardening and working the land. He's a very different person from the father I knew growing up.

First of all, to host it in Belarus? A puppet state of Putin's? It reminds me of that scene from *Serenity* (the *Firefly* movie) where Inara asks Mal for help and immediately after she hangs up Mal looks over at Zoe and says \"Sooooo... trap?\", and Zoe just looks straight back and says \"Trap.\" Zelensky is not a stupid man, he is not going to march into the lion's den just because they're making overtures of peace talks.\n\nSecondly, as Putin has repeatedly done in the past, he's going to waltz in with a laundry list of completely unreasonable demands; and when Zelensky predictably says no or tries to find a compromise, Putin will throw his toys out of the pram and claim that it's *Ukraine* being the unreasonable ones, because they refuse to agree to any terms.\n\nZelensky wants peace - he says that every time he opens his mouth. But he's not an idiot. If peace talks are going to happen, they'll need to be in a neutral location, with realistic expectations. By invading a sovereign nation under the pretense of \"peacekeeping\", by keeping his own soldiers in the dark as to why they're goose stepping into Ukraine in the first place, by ramping up nuclear rhetoric... his every word and action is in bad faith.\n\nAgain, I don't want to speak for my father. But we talked about this specific issue - peace talk offers in Belarus - and we are in firm agreement. My dad's language was perhaps just a little more colourful. That doesn't mean we're right, but you're asking for his thoughts so I can at least speak to that.\n\nAlso, despite all these armchair four star generals on Reddit, I have no idea about military strategy beyond being able to win on immortal difficulty on Civilisation VI (deity still kicks my arse). So any comment I have about troop escalation or anything like that should be completely ignored - the same goes for every other 'expert' on Reddit whose credentials amount to \"I've played Call of Duty, I got this\".\n\nAs for forgiveness - Zelensky has already given an emotional plea to Russian solders to lay down their arms and save their own lives. It's not the Ukrainians who are shooting fleeing soldiers and civilians. It's not Ukrainians bombing children's hospitals or running over escaping cars with tanks. It seems to me that Ukrainians are keen to forgive Russians, they bear the Russian people no ill will.

Relationships are complicated.\n\nDad was absent or otherwise engaged for a lot of my childhood, either because he was away trying to make money so we could have a roof over our heads and food to eat, or because I wasn't at home. I went to boarding school for much of my early years (9-13) and then during my more formative years at high school/college (14-18) I spent most of my time at school, because I was on about 4 different scholarships and was expected to attend so much pre- and after-school stuff, I was rarely at home. And at weekends my dad was usually exhausted, and I had a long list of chores to do. Then I went to university in another city, so I was away for most of the year. By the time I finished my degree, I didn't have a home to come back to, and my dad had already moved to Ukraine.\n\nThere are few instances I can remember of my dad and I really sharing quality time together. My little sister, the youngest of the family, was always his favourite - they were always incredibly close, and when my dad left for Ukraine it affected her more than anybody else.\n\nSo really, we've never been THAT close. There are some things that he did in times of desperation that affected me and our relationship negatively. But we are both adults, we have a mutual respect. I love him very much. I am glad that we have a relationship. Perhaps we don't talk as often as we could - I live in New Zealand, with him in Ukraine it's difficult to juggle timezones etc. But that's more of an excuse than anything else. We don't talk to each other regularly, but we catch up now and again. I haven't spoken to him this much, since the invasion began, for many many years. Not since I stayed with him in Ukraine for a month back in 2010.\n\nWe don't argue. I don't argue with my parents. I am 100% honest with them, and always have been. They don't always appreciate or enjoy everything I have to say, but they accept that at least I am being honest with them, and I think they have come to respect that.\n\nAs for my half-sister, unfortunately I've only met her once. I've talked to her several times on the phone as she's grown up. My dad's wife was heavily - and I mean HEAVILY - pregnant with her while I was staying with them in Ukraine. I was hoping I'd get to meet her, but she went into labour about 2 or 3 days after I left! The only time I've met her was one Christmas when I was in the UK with my fianc\u00e9e and he was there with his family. We met up at a pub in our hometown with my two siblings, my dad, his wife, and their daughter. She was only about 5 or 6 years old but such a sweet girl. She seems to have inherited the best qualities of my father. She's smart, funny, and is mischievous without being naughty.

But to be honest, you can glean a lot of it from reading some of his other responses in the thread.\n\nI actually kind of answered it already [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t3wdna/iama_refugee_at_the_slovakiaukraine_border/hyvctvl/), but really it's a combination of finding love and acceptance, but also just being in a different stage of his life. In the UK he was always struggling to make ends meet, raising 3 kids and a mortgage and putting them through private school was a huge drain on, well, him. His mood. His temperament. His presence.\n\nHe's not the same man now as the father I grew up with. He has found happiness in the relative simplicity of life in Ukraine. He makes a basic but honest living. He has become much more attuned to simple pastoral pastimes like DIY, growing food, and keeping livestock like rabbits and ducks. He leads a far more plain and far less stressful life.\n\nHis wife supports him in everything he does, she is a wonderful partner to him, tempers his worst impulses and encourages his best. And he is raising one daughter rather than three children at a time; he is able to give her his attention and focus, and his constant presence in her life means he is better able to see her as the beautiful, unique individual that she is, rather than being called upon only to play the role of meting out discipline, providing transportation, and constant financial servitude.\n\nHis idiosyncrasies have been placed in a different context; and have become more *features* of his personality than flaws. He has mellowed. He has gained wisdom. He has gained some peace.\n\nHe is an incredibly kind man. This, he always has been. I believe that's something intrinsic to him, you can hear it in his voice. But the financial and emotional stresses of his life in the UK were of a different scope, and that kindness made less apparent to those closest to him. Now that he has a lighter load to bear, his anger and stress defused, that kindness shines through everything else. This was not so much the case when I was a kid.\n\nSo it's not so much that he prefers one country to another, it's more that he has found a home in Ukraine like he never did in the UK.\n\nThis is a man who was driven from his homeland as a child by civil war. He was not granted a home by birthright; he had to find one. If I have learned anything from travelling and living on three different continents during my lifetime so far, it's that you do not automatically best belong in the place you happen to find yourself. We are taught to believe we are - especially in countries where nationalism is made akin to virtue, like China or the US. But it simply is not the case. What you are used to, is not always what is best for you. In my mind, my father was never 'at home' living in the UK, compared with in Ukraine. Now that the shoe is on the other foot, he has found it to be a more comfortable fit.\n\nI think that as one of his children from his 'failed' marriage, I should feel envious that his daughter and stepson are growing up with a different, more mellow, more present father. But I don't feel that way. I'm just happy that he has found his own happiness. It's all I ever wanted for my parents, watching them argue and fight and stress over money and never really seeing them happy during my entire childhood. I find it incredibly heartwarming to see how he has changed, and how he genuinely enjoys life now. His life is not free of hardships, but he bears them more happily, and they become lighter.\n\nThis situation in Ukraine has done nothing to dull his adoration of a country that welcomed him with open arms and has only ever really shown him kindness and warmth, compared with a country that sought to bleed him dry at every opportunity and never really seemed to have his back.\n\nIncidentally, my mum also remarried and is also blissfully happy compared to the mother that raised me. She loves her life now, and reminds me of it every time we talk. She loves her husband, she loves her little house with her Japanese toilet and kitchen that she designed herself, with her Thermomix and Instant Pot and all her other gizmos. It makes me smile just to think of it.\n\nI'm just happy for both of them. They got married and had kids far too young; but have found love, peace, and comfort in the second half of their lives. Throughout my childhood and my adult life, seeing them under constant pressure and stress, it's really all I've ever wanted for them. I'm happy for my half-sister and stepbrother, that they have a father who can be there for them, who has found somewhere he belongs and can thrive rather than survive.\n\nSorry, this answer got away from me a little bit.", "created_utc": "1646115696.0", "edited": "1646912586.0", "id": "hyvrhzr", "is_submitter": "True", "link_id": "t3_t3wdna", "parent_id": "t1_hyvmign", "score": "429", "subreddit": "IAmA", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qzb6"}, {"author": "kinggimped", "body": "kinggimped: Already answered [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t3wdna/iama_refugee_at_the_slovakiaukraine_border/hyvl0fj/).", "created_utc": "1646115022.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hyvqgc7", "is_submitter": "True", "link_id": "t3_t3wdna", "parent_id": "t1_hyvqeds", "score": "3", "subreddit": "IAmA", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qzb6"}, {"author": "kinggimped", "body": "kinggimped: He grew up in the middle east.

Seems like such a long time ago now. I had been with my fianc\u00e9e (now wife) since around 2010, but because we were living in Shanghai and my dad was in Ukraine, he had never met her. I didn't want to get married without my dad meeting my fianc\u00e9e, so I offered to fly him over to Kuala Lumpur, where my wife and I were going to spend a week or so on holiday. He wouldn't accept the offer at first, because he wanted to pay his own way, but I eventually convinced him that if I paid for the flight, he could pay for the hotel (me knowing full well how cheap hotels are in Asia).\n\nIt was his first time in Asia, he loved it, we had a fantastic time, he adored my fianc\u00e9e. Many fond memories of that trip.\n\nAs for visiting, no, I'm in New Zealand, during covid times it's very difficult to come and go. It's also a really long way and sadly I have to work to pay rent. I am very much hoping the best for them, and keeping in as close contact as I can.\n\nYes, I am worried about my dad. I don't want to shift any sympathy over to me, because I'm about as far removed from the warzone as I can be, and everything for me is just concern for the safety of my father and his family.

Honestly, I've been a zombie over the past few days and my wife has been incredibly supportive, and my dog is the best.\n\nBut now with my dad relatively safe at the border - albeit still not crossed over yet - last night I was able to get 8 hours of sleep and today I feel much more human.

But she's sad.\n\nLike all of us. We are all sad.\n\n(Wife, A, chips in): She's not scared, because she hasn't seen... the reality...\n\nDad: Yes, she's not scared. She hasn't seen... any real shit in front of her. But she's sad, like all of us, about what is happening. It's... (sigh) ... it really, really, really is an unbelievable situation, that a country like Ukraine - a country that hasn't done anything wrong, to anyone - can find itself in this situation.\n\nBut D is fine. She reads news. She looks for news for us. She looks at various posts. And of course, we read the good, the bad, and the ugly. We know that a lot of the stuff is a load of crap, but we still look at it, we read it, we try to make sense out of it.\n\nBut yes. She's good. She's fine. She's coping well. And of course, the good people in this area are looking after *everybody*, very, very well. No differentiation between colour, religion, nationality. This is one thing Ukraine doesn't 'know', racism. In any of its forms. It doesn't know it.\n\nShe's fine. No, she's fine.\n\nNone of us were looking forward to this trip. At all.\n\n(~5 seconds of silence.

Our cat is at home.\n\n(Wife, A, with a smile): Well, our cat is neither here nor there.\n\nDad: (chuckles) Well yeah, because it's a cat. But... the dog. Our third child, here in Ukraine.

My family comes first. I have to make sure my family is safe first. And of course I will come back to Ukraine. And it will be very soon, either when...\n\n(Wife, A, murmurs in the background without a hint of humour in her voice): Shoots himself...\n\nDad: Yeah. Either shoots himself, like Hitler. Or... he retreats with his tail between his legs to a place, god knows where, because nobody will accept him any more. Nobody will accept *Russians* any more. I heard in Europe, there are reports coming out that they're not accepted in hotels, restaurants, cafes... they are isolated at the airports. They can't use their credit cards. They are well and truly stuck and fucked.\n\nOf course, Ukrainians, believe it or not, they have *absolutely nothing* against the Russian people. At all. They never have. Even after taking Crimea, and the Donbas. They never had anything against Russians, the people. It's the establishment. It's Putin.\n\n---\n\nkinggimped: I can confirm that growing up in a house with my dad, he is a legendary morning shitter, you could set a clock to the start of his daily bowel movement, and the bathroom was generally off-limits for a good 45 minutes, plus another 15 to allow the stench to dissipate. When he said he hadn't been able to shit in 2.5 days I didn't even think to question it. Also, TMI, but I totally inherited his shitting gene.

I mean, the population is something like 30,000 and that includes the surrounding villages. I managed to 'charm' the attendant at the petrol station to fill up on the day we left. Usually they give a maximum of 20 litres - well, not usually, just in the last 4 days - 20 litres per car, per day. But I managed to fill up 20 litres in the evening, and then 30 litres in the morning. And we just kept on going. I have a 20 litre canister, a can, in the boot of the car. And on the way from home to here, about 1100km, at any opportunity - *every* opportunity where there was a petrol station without long queues, I would just stop and add whatever I could add, and that's how we kept on going.\n\nAnd no, we are not going to run out of fuel, because against all odds, I used my head and initiative to keep the tank full.\n\n---\n\nkinggimped: My dad is a super pragmatic guy. In a situation like this, he's somebody you'd want on your team. To be honest, I just realised that I never even asked him about the fuel situation.

We did not believe it would ever happen. We just thought, it's some kind of political manoeuvre to bully Ukraine into doing what he wants, or not doing what he wants. The same goes for the people on the street. I can't say anything about what the government or officials in Ukraine were thinking, they were probably taking it more seriously. It's just, the people in the street, they are very peaceful, a very simple nation. They are very \"live and let live\", and nobody believed this would happen. Everyone was going about their lives normally.\n\nNow, would I have done anything differently? The only reason I have done everything in the last 4 days the way I've done it, is because for the last 2 or 3 weeks I have been getting a lot of emails from the foreign office in the UK asking me to leave. I just... didn't want to leave. For me, this is home. I live here. My wife, my child. We have a life. A dog, a cat. The normal stuff. And after 17 years, you don't just get up and go.\n\n(deep sigh)\n\nBut, the last few days, I could actually feel that the people who were calling me from the UK, from the British Consulate in Spain, they were very worried. Very concerned. And now I know why. Now I know. I had to go to Lviv, about 950km from home, to collect a passport, an emergency passport, called an ETD (Emergency Travel Document) for my daughter, D. And I was very lucky to get it, because 2 days later they vacated the hotel they were staying outside Lviv, and moved to Poland.\n\n(Wife, A, chips in in the background, in Ukrainian)\n\nDad: (agreeing with wife) Yes, that's right. I went, actually, on the very first day of the invasion. He invaded *while I was on the train*. So, yeah. Probably I would have done things differently by leaving a week earlier. But I wouldn't have left straight away, because no one - *no one* - believed he would do it. Nobody believed after the Kremlin and Putin kept on 'confirming' that \"we are not here to invade Ukraine\". All the news said it's an \"exercise\", a \"military exercise\". And when he started to put troops in Belarus, again, all the news, all the reports that were coming out said \"this is for a military exercise\".\n\n(another deep sigh)\n\nWell, yep, this is what they told their soldiers as well. And now they are paying the price.\n\n\n---\n\nkinggimped: I contacted dad about it as soon as the Russian troop buildup on the borders hit the news.
