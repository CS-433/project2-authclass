In terms of a podcast between innerFrench and native podcasts, I don\u2019t really know of anything.

I just recommend listening to native content now, and listening to a singular episode (or part of an episode, if that\u2019s too much) multiple times. Sure, it\u2019s tedious, but it really does help in the long term.
