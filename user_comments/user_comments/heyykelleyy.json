Almost all the quote bot and fan accounts made announcements that they were going to stop supporting or shut down their accounts entirely.\n\nWhat was the issue? The mangaka wrote BL doujin of a problematic ship (15 - 23 age gap + brothers iirc) a while back and followed a loli/shota artist on pixiv. The fandom immediately jumped to the conclusion that this makes the mangaka a pedophile and child abuser. One person even said this \"changes the context\" of a very charged and emotional scene between two of the characters (No, it doesn't. They were drawing nude portraits of themselves separated by a screen and it's a manga about art). If following a shota artist on pixiv and drawing BL makes her a pedophile, what does that make Oda (One Piece) and Takagi (Ruroni Kenshin), the actual predator/supporter?\n\nLike, it's astonishing how many people don't realize that almost *every* single mangaka (and even the voice actors) are involved in \"problematic\" work and are happily pro-fiction/proship because they *do not care.* It's all people who are brand new to the animanga scene too so it just makes it worse.\n\nPart of me is glad that they're gatekeeping themselves, but it just solidifies that a huge reason why fandom is so lonely is because of people like these.

It's given me an opportunity to think more about Eirene's story.\n\nHer main thing is that she's been corrupted by the King and her mother \u2014 her parents \u2014 to believe that magic is a detriment to the world, and any and all magic users are evil since magic has preceded almost every catastrophic event in history (Aisa may or may not have been the cause behind a few of them, but alas). So it's more so an inflated sense of self-worth, coupled with black-and-white thinking because she was manipulated by her parents and led to believe that she's above magic users due to her \"golden\" eyes. Fun! It doesn't help that the Kingdom is highly isolationist on top of rejecting magic, so it's unlikely that she's met anyone to try and break her out of his mindset until it was too late. I can see some options for a redemption arc or something similar once the climax hits, so I'll consider it!!\n\nOn Leon:\n\nThere definitely won't be love at first sight, you can be sure of that LOL.\n\nThe reason I describe Leon and Aisa's relationship \"one sided\" enemies-to-lovers is because Leon's another victim of the anti-magic sentiments and propaganda in the kingdom. So, he genuinely believes that magic is only used for evil, and that his mission is a means to an end in order to protect the kingdom.

The First Princess: Cassandra Athanas. Aisa's eventual support and best friend in the castle. The Seer of the Court with a rebellious streak and got written off as \"mad\" for it. Hector's twin sister.\n4. The Crown Prince: Hector Athanas. Heir to the throne and an unlikely yet crucial ally of Leon's. He seems to be planning something...\n5. The Rival: Eirene Adicia.

Maybe occasionally asking their readers for general critique.\n\nA *lot* of people post because they had a cool or fun idea, and wanted to share and enjoy it with like-minded people who would also potentially enjoy it. They just want to have a good time with other people in their fandom. That's it, nothing deeper. They don't ask nor want for critique because it's just a hobby they want to have fun with.\n\nAnyone who thinks that a person posted means that person automatically bares themselves to criticism is, frankly, fucked up. The Internet isn't a lawless *free-for-all* just because we're faceless strangers, there's Internet etiquette classes for a reason.

A lot of media is for free.  \n>  \n>But no one hesitates to critique or comment on those.\n\nAnd *I* would argue that fanfic has a closer knit community than most free media, and *because* it's become a community (damn near subculture) that we have our own etiquette regarding criticism.\n\nA huge point you're missing is that the fanfiction community is unique in how widespread yet closely-knit it is. Any \"free media\" you could come up with as a counterpoint, fanfic will be there if their fanbase is large enough. YouTubers? There's fanfic. An indie music group? There's fanfic. A *free comic* telling a fictional story? There's probably going to be fanfic for that too.\n\nUsing your example of music: A vast majority of music is geared towards reaching the biggest audiences they can while doing what they love, but it's very rare you'll find a widespread community that's as close-knit as the fanfic community is (other than other fan-centric communities such as cosplay and fanart). This is because there's still ultimately a separation between the artist and \"consumers\" no matter how chummy they are, and the \"consumer's\" opinion doesn't hold as much weight.\n\nThe dynamics between \"artists\" and \"consumers\" are different with fanfic since \u2014 reiterating u/frozenfountain's point \u2014 we're all peers here. Where a musician's fan most likely can't create their own music, and would rely on the musician for their music, a reader could easily be a writer themselves or become one.\n\nBefore you argue that \"fans could become musicians too\" (because you'd just be arguing over semantics at that point), it's a lower bar of entry for fanfic. Anyone literate with an idea and a fandom can open a Google Doc or pick up a pen and start writing fanfic, and this low bar for entry has created a unique community where we're all peers and have certain rules for etiquette that other creative spaces may not have unless they're niche.\n\nAnd, if I'm going to be honest, your question was flawed from the start. The original point that you're trying to question was never that \"authors and fans think fanfiction should be free of criticism and critique versus other media\" or whatever, and if that was your interpretation then I'm sorry. It's that ***we should have the right to say whether or not we want critique***, because we deserve that basic respect in our own community.\n\n\"The internet isn't a safe space\" is *such* a weak counterpoint that it's not even worth being brought up, since we're trying to *create* our own safe space within the Internet, with rules and etiquette within the community.\n\nSome rando *choosing* to disrespect that etiquette, *choosing* to give unsolicited criticism without an author's consent, acting like their critique is *so* important that it has to be heard regardless of consent, just because \"the world's tuff get used to it\" is incredibly rude and entitled.\n\nWe don't *care* if someone wants to give criticism or not, we care about our boundaries being respected.

Tensions are growing with AI activist and terrorist groups. Could be omitted as there's not much, plot wise, that happens during the 2050s other than FAS's success in the military market, but this would most likely be where all the foreshadowing for the Faro Plague happens.\n\n\u2014 Act 3: 2064.

Opens with Elisabet going into Ted's office and the meeting where he tells her about the glitch, and then Elisabet later doing the projections and the big reveal about the Faro Swarm: it'll strip the earth barren in 15 months. Elisabet meets with General Herres, we get the Zero Dawn recruitment holograms, and Project Zero Dawn and Enduring Victory begin in earnest. Major moments include GAIA's first reveal as a sentient AI and the kill-switch argument, Far Zenith trying to steal GAIA, the launch and \"destruction\" of the Odyssey, the collapse of the front lines at USRC, and the Alphas being forced to seal themselves into GAIA Prime.\n\nThe last episode ends with a shot slowly zooming in on of one of GAIA Prime's access port seals closing, before malfunctioning and stopping with a seam of 10mm.\n\n>!There could even be a bonus scene, after the credits roll.

And while self-inserts *can* and *have* become Mary Sues (guilty in my early days), not all do. (The Mary Sue-ification of self-inserts usually ends up coming from a place of wanting to feel powerful/important anyway, so I don't blame them even if I don't like them. I mean, who doesn't like a good power trip every once in a while? /s)\n\nFor me, my first *official* OC stemmed out of being a genuine self-insert out of curiosity (How would I be in this world? What would I like to be? What contributions could I have made to conversations?), but the story got away from me and she ended up becoming her own full fledged character, just one that's similar to me and has a similar voice. (In fact, she's *easier* for me to write this way since I don't have to think too hard about her \"staying in character,\" *I'm* the character!)\n\nI also have an *actual* self-insert, with my alternative name instead of my real one because I have a selfship I like to write about with my friend. The line is different here because I *intended* for her to be me. She has my appearance, my voice, my clothes, my likes and dislikes, and everything that I am. The only thing I changed was her name because reading my own name in my fics made me cringe way too hard.\n\nIs my OC a Mary Sue because she's my idealized self in any world I write her in? I don't think so, she still has her flaws that are unique, born out of the fandom-specific backstories I tailor for her. She's my game avatar, someone I use to try and see what happens if I place her here or there in the story,\n\nIs my self-insert a Mary Sue because she's meant to be me? I don't think so either. She's meant to be me, so flaws and insecurities come in the package. Some things will be embellished and idealized (she'll use more flowery language, and be more sure of verbal affection), but nothing too extreme. \n\nI ended up rambling, but my verdict: Unless the reader actually knows who you are as a person \u2014 your idiosyncrasies and the way you talk and act \u2014 it's highly unlikely that anyone will think that your OC is a self-insert.

Late teen (19) with plenty of online communication experience here! Another person pointed it out, but it's better to focus on topics rather than *how* they're texting.\n\nThis is, of course, dependent on what *kind* of \"uneducated\" the other person is. Did they not have access to formal education or is their education considered \"less prestigious\"? Are they sheltered and uneducated on world events? Are they literate? Are they not used to texting (whether at all or in the primary language)? Are they more street-smart/social vs. book-smart/secluded? These things impact how the person will text.\n\nFor example:\n\n\u2014 Someone that's focused on academia and isn't used to online communication/social media will probably text like they're submitting it to an English teacher: perfect punctuation, no slang, capitalization, technical verbiage and vocabulary.\n\n\u2014 Someone who's also \"educated,\" but more involved in social spaces will text closer to how I text: the vocabulary is still a bit excessive, but they're more inclined to use emojis, lapslock, or slang. Maybe memes will be thrown in. Like, I had to go back and edit in capitalization because I text out without capitalization out of habit.\n\n\u2014 Someone whose first language isn't English, but is involved in social spaces will try to stick closer to \"proper\" English: capitalization and grammar, but words may slip (your/you're, there/they're, incorrect spelling/words) and they'll use emojis. Slang is probably sparse or they'll start using slang after they learn the contexts and meaning.\n\nI'm going to be completely honest here though. It's... kind of weird to try and portray someone's education level through text.\n\nAnyone literate can text, regardless of their education, and there's not much that can be inferred from the way they text. Someone who uses perfect punctuation and grammar could say something *completely and confidently* wrong or uninformed. Someone who texts like \"**omg brooo lol idfk how u did that since ur bitchless but like go off ig**\" could be the one you have deep and insightful conversations with about relationships or world events.\n\nYou should definitely still try and research how people your characters' ages will text though (I advise against fandom twitter, it works but it's also a cesspool), but try and curb the \"texting should be indicative of education level\" because that is *so* outdated.\n\n(and be careful and make sure someone's \"uneducated\" texting isn't just AAVE.

They're not European and they're not historians either, how would they know what's accurate when they could just handpick a few pretty early 18th century dresses to plop into a late 19th century-based OI?

It's *only* useful when the OG Villainess was powerless/disrespected/ignored, which was a factor in why OGV went down the Villainess route, which the FL obviously wants to avoid.\n\nAristocracy is basically one huge pissing contest, so the disrespectful maid is a narrative device to show just how *bad* the FL's situation is, where even a low-ranked maid would disrespect a noble daughter of a high ranking family. Following that knowledge, the FL slapping the disrespectful maid is a way for the FL to start establishing her power in the household by not being a doormat anymore. This trope has to be used in conjunction with being a kind master otherwise to the rest of the maids, so it widens the gap between That One Maid\u2122 and the others.

The slap wasn't unprovoked and *shouldn't* be for the trope to work.\n\nYes, the disrespectful maid will think she's an a-hole, but most of the other maids are smart enough to realize that the slap was justified and it'll create a ripple effect where the staff will learn that they can't treat the FL the same without consequences, which was the point in the first place.

I also personally think it's a good insight into where a character may stand considering Yuka's identity, where Yatora (who's arguably not as open, especially in the beginning) uses \"Ryuji\" but Yuka's grandmother and Mori use \"Yuka.\"\n\nUntil the author decides to expand on Yuka for future plot, Yuka's gender is entirely up in the air and doesn't really lie anywhere on the binary spectrum. They're still unsure and Yatora's an unreliable narrator, but it is worth mentioning that Yuka conformed to being \"fem\" (dating guys, using fem-aligned pronouns, playing the role of a crossdresser) because it makes it easier for them to explain away that they just like cute things that have been assigned as \"feminine\" along with the suppression of liking women as well. Playing the role of being fem-aligned was easier than explaining that they were non-binary/gender non-conforming, I suppose.\n\nI'm honestly quite confused as to where the insistence upon *not* referring to Yuka with he/him or he/they came from, considering they're still fine with it and even told the guy they went on a date with that they were a guy (and subsequently got dumped for it). Japanese pronouns are fluid and aren't confined to gender either, it's defined by how they want to be perceived in that moment. Anyone could use any pronoun depending on the situation, so Yuka using \"atashi\" doesn't really hold water for me imo.\n\n(Tangentially related, it does make me quite sad at seeing many people pushing to fit a label onto Yuka in efforts to not misgender them, which ends up going against Yuka's entire character.
