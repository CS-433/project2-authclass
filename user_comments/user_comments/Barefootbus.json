I'm a 2 stripe white belt and I've started to try and work on specific things but it feels quite inefficient at the moment. \n\nI originally picked one thing to work on but half the time I can't even practice the skill cause of the roll is fought in a different position. \n\nSo I tried broadening my scope by working on a few things at once, e.g. 1 type of guard, pass, submission  from top and bottom, escape from bottom. But now it feels like it's too broad and my effort is being spread out too thin. \n\nDo you have any ideas on how to effectively practice specific things in rolls?", "created_utc": "1556456911.0", "edited": "False", "id": "elz8uf7", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_bi9soe", "parent_id": "t3_bi9soe", "score": "3", "subreddit": "bjj", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qn02"}, {"author": "Barefootbus", "body": "Nice.", "created_utc": "1555415726.0", "edited": "False", "id": "el0gqta", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_bdsjwh", "parent_id": "t3_bdsjwh", "score": "2", "subreddit": "dankmemes", "subreddit_id": "t5_2zmfe"}, {"author": "Barefootbus", "body": ".", "created_utc": "1554200225.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ejxrlv9", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_b87viz", "parent_id": "t3_b87viz", "score": "1", "subreddit": "wallstreetbets", "subreddit_id": "t5_2th52"}, {"author": "Barefootbus", "body": "I'm not sure what's happening but I'm liking it ", "created_utc": "1554189478.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ejxlsdv", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_b8fu8y", "parent_id": "t3_b8fu8y", "score": "3", "subreddit": "sequence", "subreddit_id": "t5_2ygdt"}, {"author": "Barefootbus", "body": "Thanks, with the last one it says 'only for alien registration' the only thing I could put there is my bank account number for my bank here at home.
