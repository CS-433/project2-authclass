First some algebra:\n\n[f(x+h) - f(x)]/h = [a^(x+h) - a^(x)]/h = [a^(x)a^(h) - a^(x)]/h = a^(x)[a^(h) - 1]/h\n\nSo, f'(x) = lim[h->0] [f(x+h)-f(x)]/h = lim[h->0] a^(x) [a^(h) - 1]/h = a^(x) lim[h->0] [a^(h) - 1]/h = f(x) \\* L(a)\n\nwhere L(a) is the value of that limit which only depends on a and is therefore a constant (in x).  Moreover, this limit is precisely f'(0), whatever that may be for each given a:\n\nL(a) = lim[h->0] [a^(h) - 1]/h = lim[h->0] [a^(0+h) - a^(0)] / h = f'(0)\n\nSo, the derivative of a^x is the same function times whatever the slope of the tangent line is when x=0.  By playing around with the graph of a^x we can see that this gradient is positive for a>1, and increases with a.  (All this analysis is valid for 0<a<1 as well, with f'(0) being negative in those cases.)\n\nYou can do some numerical investigation to see that L(a) passes the value of 1 when a is somewhere around 2.7 (for now let's call this special value b, though you already know what it is), and since L(a) is always increasing, it *only* has the value of 1 this one time.\n\nUsing the special case d/dx b^(x) = b^(x) (you don't need to know the value of b for this, just that some b exists with L(b)=1), we can then use the chain rule to prove that L(a) = log_b (a) for all a>1 (and also 0<a<1):\n\nd/dx a^(x) = d/dx [ b^(log_b (a)^) ]^(x) = d/dx b^(x log_b (a)^) = [ b^(x log_b (a)^) ] \\* log_b (a) = a^x \\* log_b (a)\n\nWith b=e, we get log_b (a) = ln(a) and the general formula that d/dx a^x = a^x ln(a).", "created_utc": "1666266551.0", "edited": "1666267014.0", "id": "it23qtx", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_y8u7xh", "parent_id": "t3_y8u7xh", "score": "16", "subreddit": "learnmath", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rdi4"}, {"author": "marpocky", "body": "> And that's why everyone laughs at you.\n\nWe'll see who gets laughed at, the one who claims children visiting drag shows will somehow stunt their geography education, or the one who called this out as an absolutely ridiculous take.", "created_utc": "1666264835.0", "edited": "False", "id": "it20xtw", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_y8o1zq", "parent_id": "t1_it1y7qo", "score": "4", "subreddit": "geography", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qnms"}, {"author": "marpocky", "body": ">\"safe space\", \"gender fluidity\" culture, children visiting drag shows, people protesting over some nonsense\n\nAnd here the truth comes out.

And I still don't know why we're talking about it. You brought it up when I mentioned how similar the home nations are to US states, which has nothing at all to do with independence movements.\n\n>And as far as trade and diplomacy are concerned, HK is most ertaonly treated completely differently from China. They have differences in importation rights and abilities, significantly different financial rules and taxation, and are regarded commercially as entirely separate from China (we export there, but not China as a result)\n\nI didn't say it wasn't treated differently.  HK's foreign relations, including trade and diplomacy, are handled by China.  When you trade or have other relations with them, you're dealing with China.  The fact that in that particular dealing they're representing the HK portion of China (which has its own rules and policies) and not the mainland portion of China (which has others) is unrelated to the fact that, on the world stage, HK has to go through China.  This has been part of the deal since 1997.  (What's changed, mainly, is HK's level of autonomy over internal affairs, directly counter to the deal that was effected in 1997. That sucks for them but is a separate issue.)\n\n>And yes, I am oversimplified things, of course. But that doesn't make them any less true.\n\nIt does when you present the simplified version as \"the way it is.\"\n\n>However, I take your point. I don't live there and all I have to base what the rest of the world feels about it, or for that matter to guage the feelings of those who live there, is what I see in the news, what's reported from inside HK, the constant recent riots, and the stories and feelings of those I know who both live there and come from there.\n\nYour (I think mild) sarcasm isn't lost on me here, and I do not want to be mistaken for someone who *supports* the continued subjugation of HKers by Beijing.  But the fact is that the tide is turning.  HK's dependence on the mainland is only growing while the mainland's dependence on HK is only shrinking.
