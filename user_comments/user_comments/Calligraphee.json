Since you don't have a ton of experience, let's leave this in, but edit it to remove \"I\" statements and fix some grammatical errors. I would suggest rewriting it to read something like, \"Recent computer science graduate from the University of Examples. Seeking an entry-level \\[web development OR software development; change the wording for each individual job you apply to\\] position that merges my educational experience with my passion for software development and emerging technologies.\" That gets rid of some of the redundancy and typos and is more direct, plus combines some of your \"interests.\"\n\nNext, let's look at how we can beef up your existing sections. For education, if you had a good GPA, I would suggest listing it, but if it's only so-so, don't add it. I would, however, add a \"relevant coursework\" subheading where you can list some of the classes you took that you think would translate well to a job. This can show employers exactly what you're proficient in regarding compsci. For your experience section, I would reformat it more like this:\n\n**Experience and Projects**\n\n* Mobile app development\n   * Utilized Ionic to create a mobile app for scanning barcodes and retrieving information\n   * Completed as part of graduation requirements at University of Example\n* Chrome extension development\n   * Designed a extension for copying URLs of all open websites for increasing productivity\n* University industrial training at Ministry of Health\n   * \\[Insert a short bullet point about this; do not use \"I\" or words like \"simple,\" \"basic,\" etc.\\]\n\nI would combine languages and skills into one section, but I would drastically change the skills you have listed. You have a degree in computer science, *of course* you're proficient in computers and typing. Leave off \"attention to detail;\" it's obviously a filler and you should use your resume to show, not tell. Maybe something like this:\n\n**Skills and Languages**\n\nLanguages:\n\n* Arabic \\[insert proficiency: C1, C2, Native, \"full professional proficiency,\" whichever applies\\]\n* English \\[again, insert proficiency\\]\n\nSkills:\n\n* Ionic for mobile development\n* \\[Any other programming platforms/languages/software you know\\]\n\nGet rid of the \"interests\" section; you wouldn't have studied compsci if you weren't interested in computers and tech!\n\nYou have the bones of a good resume here; you can just talk yourself up a bit more and make it a bit more professional-sounding. If you have links to github, your app, your Chrome extension, or anything else like that, add hyperlinks to the relevant sections so future employers can see your work.

In the US (where I assume you are, as you have NYC listed as your city), photos are always a terrible idea to include. They're more common on European CVs, so if you're applying to jobs in Europe I'd leave it on, but in that case, your location of NYC could be a deterrent.\n\nSecondly, your summary is much, *much* too long. In general, keep it to 2-3 sentences with no \"I\" statements. Rather than just saying blindly that you can do these skills, use the bullet points in your experiences to show that expertise. I would recommend changing your summary to something like \"Museum and gallery professional with 4+ years of experience. Seeking a position that combines curatorial and public-facing tasks.\" They learn where you went to college and what other kinds of experiences you had as soon as they go on to the next section.\n\nThirdly, for your degrees, include a bit more info. Were you involved in any clubs or honors societies? What was the title of your MA thesis (assuming you wrote one)? A bullet point or two can help this section. In particular for your MA, I would include a very short \"relevant coursework\" bullet point with a short list of 2-3 of the classes you took that you would be most relevant to your position.\n\nFourthly, for your jobs/internships, you really need to include months in the dates. If you just say \"2022,\" does that mean the entirety of 2022? Did you start Jan 1? Or have you been in that role for 3 days? Without more specific lengths of time, it looks like you're trying to make short experiences ambiguous to try to make it look more impressive, which isn't a great idea.\n\nFifthly, your experiences are all super interesting and relevant, but your descriptions are very long. I think there must be a way to word them to you don't have one word extending onto the next line; it looks a bit unpolished. I suspect if you got rid of some of the white space between the dates and the text this could help reformat it a bit and make it slightly shorter, which would be good. I think you might want to reword a bunch of these to make them more specific. For example, let's take your archaeological experience: you say that you \"studied objects and structures to identify, date, and authenticate artifacts.\" What kind of objects, structures, and artifacts? Were you looking at frescoes from the palace period Mycenae? Pottery sherds from Sparta? Specificity is always better! (By the way, if you don't mind, what *were* you working on? I studied Classical archaeology in undergrad and am actually in Athens this summer going to allllll the museums).\n\nSixthly, the skills thing is unneeded and the dots are confusing. What is a perfect 5/5 dots? What is 3/5? Why would you advertise not being great at some things? If you can, just incorporate these skills into your bullet points, and if necessary, add a third sentence to your summary: \"Fully proficient in A, B, C, and D.\"\n\nI'm sorry for all of these critiques, but I think whoever you paid to write your resume definitely ripped you off. While it's a very pretty layout, there's a lot of extraneous stuff that you can get rid of to make it shorter. I think you could easily get this down to 1.25 pages, which is still long, but better than 2 full. I have a bunch of museology/conservation/archaeology friends (for whom I've helped edit resumes in the last couple years for museum/curatorial positions) and it seems like the job market is really hard to get into; some of my friends are just doing tour guide stuff despite having tons of qualifications and experience, and one actually had to turn down an executive directorial position for a museum because it only paid $35k for a full-time role.

Very laid-back, chill vibe with a rich history and a great appreciation for that history. There are museums of famous Armenian poets, artists, and composers everywhere, along with the national museums. Just outside the city (accessible by car, taxi (for honestly not that much money), or bus) there are tons of hiking spots in the mountains and some pretty cool ancient sites. There's a Roman temple in the town of Garni like 40 minutes from Yerevan, which is a super neat place, as well as some ancient Christian monasteries up in the hills. The landscape of this country is absolutely unimaginably gorgeous, with insanely beautiful mountains rising up above rolling hills of greenery and red clay.\n\nThe restaurant scene in Yerevan is amazing, tons of different cuisines and all pretty inexpensive compared to Western prices. I really love laid-back traveling, so being able to just wanted through tree-lined boulevards, visiting museums and picking random restaurants for dinner is something I really enjoy. If you like classical music/ballet/opera, there's a gorgeous opera house in the center of town (again, with prices waaaaay better than in the West!).\n\nArmenia is a post-Soviet republic, so it does have some of the issues that tend to come with that classification, especially since they aren't on the Europe side of the Black Sea. Everyone here speaks Russian (and most people speak English) as well as Armenian, and everything has a feeling of having been new about 40 years ago. Armenia remains a super popular vacation spot for Russians, and tens (if not hundreds) of thousands relocated here back in March (around the same time I did) to protest the Ukrainian situation (although most of them have returned to Russia at this point). Housing was pretty expensive when they were here, since they drove up all the prices of apartments, but now things are more back to normal; an apartment in the city center will run you like $600 for a month, at the most expensive (although when I rented mine it was up to like $1500!), and it's definitely possible to find cheaper places outside the very center. Armenia does have its own political disagreements, particularly with neighboring Azerbaijan (over the disputed territory of Nagorno-Karabakh) and Turkey (due to the whole genocide thing), but they don't really affect daily living (at least for me); there have been some ongoing protests over the prime minister's unbalanced attempts at peace agreements, but things have calmed down now. But with how the world is going, who know what it will be like next summer?\n\nI've heard similarly good things about the other South Caucasian countries, Georgia and Azerbaijan.
