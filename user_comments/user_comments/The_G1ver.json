They divided the country into regions along ethnic lines. Since the TPLF originates from a minority ethnic group (Tigray), its only hope to stay in power was to pit the nation's 2 largest ethnic groups (Amhara and Oromo) against each other.\n\nYou see, Ethiopian rulers for the past many centuries belonged to the Amhara ethnic group, which aggravated the Oromo (which now slightly outnumber the Amhara). So when the current PM (who is an Oromo) was elected, many hoped that it was now \"the Oromo's turn\" to have privileged status. But PM (Dr. Abiy Ahmed) was intent on ending the cycle of corrupt governments. As a result, many Oromo and Amhara youths started joining rebellious groups that are now wreaking havoc.\n\nMeanwhile in the north, the TPLF has retreated into it's home region of Tigray. Many of its leaders were killed during the Civil war last year. Still, many Ethiopians are in contempt of Tigrians, which is why you see these \"genocide\" news articles victimizing Tigrians.\n\nFunny enough, almost all of the athletes who represented Ethiopia during last week's World Athletic Championship were Tigrians.

After being pressured by foreign governments to abandon the plan, however, the idea was put on hold.\n\n>Also, how have your family given thousands specifically to the dam?\n\nThere have been many fundraising efforts by the government during the past decade, especially during the first 5 years since 2011. People with stable income were then made to buy government bonds proportional to their salary, so my family did as well. \n\nIn addition to that, my family, as well as may others, have also willingly donated money for the cause. This is why many Ethiopians feel very strongly about this issue.\n\n>I\u2019m also very secure in my belief that the largest dam in the history of the world that is estimated to cost 7% of Ethiopia\u2019s GDP would be heavily subsidised by the Chinese Government.\n\nAgain, this is incorrect. The dam was estimated to cost about $5 billion, which came to about 100 billion ETB (local currency) at the time. The fund that was raised for the project is believed to be much higher than that number, and was probably mostly embezzled by corrupt government officials.\n\nIn addition, [reports show that approximately 2-3 billion dollars have been smuggled out of Ethiopia EVERY YEAR for over a decade](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.forbes.com/sites/realspin/2017/03/03/ethiopias-cruel-con-game/%3Fsh%3D76c80d129d00&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwjA4frw69LzAhUKmuAKHaZhAzgQFnoECAUQAg&usg=AOvVaw1b4R_oI82LKx_P8HACSCFr), which mostly included aid money (about $30 billion was \"lost\" in total). Had the government not embezzled those funds, the dam would have been completed around 2016. So you shouldn't underestimate Ethiopia's capability for funding the dam by itself.\n\n>Also why would it not be in the best interest for Ethiopia to employ Ethiopians in this nation building infrastructure opportunity?\n\nMost of the people that have been employed for the project are Ethiopians, which includes the head engineer. But the country is simply lacking in the technologies needed to build \"the largest dam in the history of the world\" as you put it, which is where China comes in.\n\nChina relationship with Ethiopia (and all of Africa, in fact) is strictly of mutual benefit, which is why they wouldn't rush to aid Ethiopia in the event of a war. This is also why China has chosen not to participate in the ongoing negotiations between Ethiopia, Sudan, and Egypt regarding the dam.\n\nEdit: typo", "created_utc": "1634522787.0", "edited": "1634523158.0", "id": "hh26qas", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_qa2kg0", "parent_id": "t1_hh1vl57", "score": "4", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i"}, {"author": "The_G1ver", "body": "As an Ethiopian, I wholeheartedly disagree with your assertions regarding the dam.\n\n>Ultimately, this Dam will impede the Nile River and leave Egypt without fresh water\n\nEthiopia does acknowledge the effect the damage will have on Egypt's water supply,  but the effects are not nearly as devastating as you are suggesting.\n\n>and then the question of how is Ethiopia funding the largest Dam in the history of the universes production becomes relevant.  \n\nI don't understand what you're saying here. Are you suggesting China funded the dam? Chinese contractors have worked on the dam, sure, but most, if not all, of the funding has come from the Ethiopian people. The World Bank refused to let the Ethiopian government borrow any money, so calling the whole thing \"China's dam\" is very insulting. My very own family has contributed thousands of dollars to the dam.\n\nAnd finally, I highly doubt Egypt would attack Ethiopia any time soon. Egypt may have the strongest military in Africa, but Ethiopia's army is among the top 5 in the continent. And you may think the recent Civil War has weakened my country, but you couldn't be more misinformed. Nationalism in Ethiopia is at an all-time high right now, so if Egyptians want war, they sure as hell are gonna get one.\n\nI also want to say, being one of the major sources of the Nile, my only regret is that my country did not utilize this resource centuries ago. I have heard numerous conspiracies regarding Egypt's role in impending Ethiopians' efforts to develop the Nile throughout history, and the recent clashes have only confirmed many people's suspicions regarding Egypt's stance on Ethiopia's development.\n\nEdit: typo", "created_utc": "1634516618.0", "edited": "1634522953.0", "id": "hh1uer8", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_qa2kg0", "parent_id": "t1_hh1fpre", "score": "6", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i"}, {"author": "The_G1ver", "body": "It's already done", "created_utc": "1634488725.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hh027ff", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_q9y7rb", "parent_id": "t1_hgznzhw", "score": "5", "subreddit": "unpopularopinion", "subreddit_id": "t5_2tk0s"}, {"author": "The_G1ver", "body": "Yeah, I can stop at any time!", "created_utc": "1634486953.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hgzy3zg", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_q9tzrb", "parent_id": "t1_hgzq2e2", "score": "6", "subreddit": "disneyvacation", "subreddit_id": "t5_3e60r"}, {"author": "The_G1ver", "body": "I couldn't hear a single Amharic word in the audio.", "created_utc": "1634486892.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hgzxyuw", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_qa1e5c", "parent_id": "t3_qa1e5c", "score": "1", "subreddit": "amharic", "subreddit_id": "t5_2zi78"}, {"author": "The_G1ver", "body": "Judging from their comment history, it's also looks like a habit.", "created_utc": "1634429261.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hgx9f3l", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_q97vgc", "parent_id": "t1_hgx6iv2", "score": "7", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "The_G1ver", "body": "Veins were drawn in blue in my science textbooks, so there was a time I believed it too.

I put myself in situations where I cannot avoid temptation, which made me lead a lifestyle of sin. \n\nI'm still working on it, but starting just this week, I decided to give everything to God and trust him to change me. I changed my daily routine so that I always read the bible and pray before going about my day. I can confidently say that this week has been the most peaceful one I've had in over a year.\n\nI grew up in a christian home and gave my life to Jesus in my early teens, so I had been quite used to having the assurance that I'll go to heaven when I die. But having had this past year's experience, I can truly sense the contrast between a holy and a sinful lifestyle. \n\nSo I'd advise you to examine your life. If you suspect something your are doing is sinful, it probably is. When you start to drift away from the faith, you start to lower the biblical standard of holiness in order to feel better (I believe the scientific term for this is \"cognitive dissonance\"). And before you know it, you'll be living like an complete unbeliever.\n\nSo again, examine your lifestyle from the true biblical perspective, that's the only way to make this feeling go away.
