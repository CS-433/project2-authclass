I find a lot of Norwegians have zero experience dealing with people from outside Europe and tend to obsess a bit over whether your name/surname fits their experience/opinion of that culture you say you are from. Its as if they cannot think of anything else to say so they fixate on what they can relate to. Racism also DOES EXIST in Norway. I have several friends experiencing quite a bit of it. I also have a friend working as a nurse who has warned me that my own surname will mean that I often end up at the end of waiting lists, etc for specific healthcare releated issues (It is not right, but it does happen) My opinion is that he was trying to be kind by warning you, but probably due to not being used to dealing with it completely missed the boat.\n\n2.

The teachers did not even realise she is not Norwegian until they met us for the first time.\n\nWe read to her every night and make sure to include reading in all three languages.

Peppa Gris is a personal recommendation because you have a narrator explaining everyday things in a way that small children can understand. If you don't get something, just watch it again a day or two later. Trust me, do not use English as a crutch.\n3. Start reading. Initially read any children's books you can get your hands on. The stuff meant for toddlers and work your way up. Here you can use a dictionary but do not fixate on specific words. If you get the gist of a paragraph or sentence, move on. I recently tested to level B2 in reading and it is just because I read every day. \n4. Use Audio books together with books to get your mind to flow when following the language. Just sight read Harry Potter or whatever whilst listening to the audio at first. Then, start to do a page, stop, redo the page while you read aloud along. You have to train your tongue to make the right sounds at the right pace. You can find endless audiobooks to stream for free at lydbok.online The narrator for Harry Potter is especially good IMO, even though half the words are useless in everyday life.\n\nedit: I did not add it at first since other already mentioned it, but Mystery of Nils is an absolutely fantastic textbook to start with.
