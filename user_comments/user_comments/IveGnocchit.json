If an OU is specified in the SearchBase parameter, no user will be returned by, for example, a specified Filter statement. A OneLevel query searches the immediate children of that path or object. This option only works when an OU is given as the SearchBase. If a user is given, no results are returned. A Subtree query searches the current path or object and all children of that path or object.

Vocabulary is king.   \nHowever, when it comes to Russian, grammar seems to be much more important than in other languages.\n\nIt's true, you will be able to speak, and you might be understood by a native a lot of the time, however when it comes to understanding the response, I find that this may be difficult without a fundamental knowledge of how the grammar works.\n\nUnlike languages such as English, Russian relies much more on the grammar to convey details. For example:\n\n**English** `We wrote that with a pen`\n\n**Russian** `\u041c\u044b \u043d\u0430\u043f\u0438\u0441\u0430\u043b\u0438 \u044d\u0442\u043e \u0440\u0443\u0447\u043a\u043e\u0439`\n\nIn English we would have the preposition **WITH** to help understand what is happening. In Russian, no proposition is used here, and the case of the noun simply goes into the instrumental case to convey **WITH**. This is a very simply example, and yes it might be possible to work out that you wrote something with a pen, and you didn't \"write a pen\", mainly because this doesn't make sense.\n\nHowever, with the word order being so free, this gets more complicated as the words move into different places. In sentences where someone is giving something to someone else, it can be difficult to understand who is giving and who is receiving without knowing which subject is in the dative case and which is in the nominative. Again, it depends on the sentence and I can't think of a better example right now. It is also especially hard when the subject is left out!\n\nSo, if you want to be understood, you might be able to get away with just knowing all of the words. However, if you want to understand the response, or generally know what is going on, you shouldn't completely ignore the grammar.
