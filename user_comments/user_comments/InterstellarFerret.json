Most listeners wont think about the fact that your melody is in Lydianb2 or whatever, and tonnes of very distinct songs just use varients on C, F, G in the harmony.\n \nBasic example of a rhythmic phrase is the beethoven motiv: Ba ba baa baaaa. Its just two notes. Another good one is the melody to desafinado, you can just clap along to the melody and its satisfying and memorable.\n\n\u2022**Study the melodic structure of your favourite verses and choruses.** Are they doing an ABAB phrase in the chorus? A straight repetition of a phrase? Are they sequencing a rhythmic phrase through the scale? \n\n**\u2022Learn different** [melody contours](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/William_Thompson10/publication/281633714/figure/fig2/AS:324337912565762@1454339592660/The-9-melodic-contours-used-in-the-Melodic-Contour-Training-Program-The-lowest-notes-are.png) **and try contrasting them between sections:** the contrast between parts keeps things interesting. going from a ramp-up type melody in the verse to a flat-falling type melody in the chorus for instance. \n\n\u2022Try playing a song you know and singing the melody with different pitches and a different contour than the original - for me it kind of reprogrammed my brain to feel the gravity of the notes and why those original melodies worked.\n\n\u2022Try deliberatly playing/singing \"wrong\" notes when writing your melodies, sometimes they'll lead you to cool new places.Also don't forget about slides between notes as an option.\n\nLastly, most importantly: **Finish your stuff!** Set a deadline and learn from each song you make. **A disappointing end product is a very useful learning tool.** The best way of getting good at writing music is by writing more music.\n\n**Try** r/songaweek **and develop a habit of always working towards a deadline for a bit**, treating it a bit like training wheels.
