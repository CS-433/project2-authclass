Why do they treat it like some kind of a competition? Or a speedrun race how can learn the language in the shortest amount of time?\n\nI understand we all want to achieve results in the shortest amount of time, no matter what we study or practice. However, when you have a full-time job, hundreds of other life commitments, it's much more important to create a habit, than to try doing it as fast as possible.\n\nI spend on Japanese around 20 minutes every day. And it's been like that for 1.5 years. Will it take me next 10 years to learn the language in that case? Maybe it will, but it's the journey that matters, not the destination. And I can ensure myself that I won't get burned out as these 20 minutes don't feel like any kind of burden for me, like \"I have to do my anki\" or \"I have to do some reading\". It feels fun, and at the same time I feel a lot of progress after some months.\n\nSo just keep going and enjoy the learning process.

I understood what this woman said!\" Or \"I know this word, it means government, they are talking about government.\" \n\nA side advice for new learners - don't stress too much that you don't understand what's happening.

Yes, media queries are your friends, don't be scared of them.\n2. I took a quick lock, as I'm weak at frontend, but it's quite good. Plus points for BEM, try to use more semantic elements in your markup. <div class=\"heading\"> could be <header class=\"heading\">. <div class=\"cards\"> could be as well <article class=\"cards\">. I will tell something more in the third point.\n3. It's great that you used BEM. I would separate each section that you comment to a separate file. Something like \\_main.scss, \\_header.scss, \\_cards.scss. This way you separate your style to different \"modules\". Modularity is really trendy these days, heh.  \nDid you know that you can nest media queries in Sass? Instead of making a separate section for them you can do something like that:  \n\n\n&#8203;\n\n    .heading {\n        text-align: center;\n        width: 50rem;\n        margin: 6rem auto;\n    \n        @media only screen and (max-width:500px) {\n            width: 80%\n        }\n    \n        &__main {\n            font-weight: 200;\n            font-size: 3.6rem;\n            color: $color-very-dark-blue;\n            line-height: 1.4;\n    \n            @media only screen and (max-width:500px) {\n                font-size: 2.4rem;\n            }\n        }\n    \n        &__sub {\n            font-size: 3.6rem;\n            color: $color-very-dark-blue;\n    \n            @media only screen and (max-width: 500px){\n                font-size: 2.4rem\n            }\n        }\n    \n        &__description {\n            margin-top: 1.3rem;\n            color: $color-grayish-blue;\n        }\n    }\n\n\nYou could argue with me that this way you need to change your 500px breakpoint in more places, but you can save it to the variable and have something like `$mobile-breakpoint: 500px`  \nand use that instead in these media queries. \n\nAlso, I would advise to not use color name in the variables. Instead of `$color-very-dark-blue`  \nI would suggest something like `$main-color`  \nThe moment you wanted to change the color of your element to something else, your variable name becomes invalid and that's something you'd want to avoid.   \n\n\n4.

Yeah, replays are one of the most important things in competetive games like counter strike. We could use some non-ranked modes, where people would go without caring about rank lose/gain. We could use a better matchmaking. A fun-modes aka 2 killers 8 survivors, some kind of a deatmatch between killers, hide and seek. We could use some flavors to encourage people to play their favorite character.\n\nHave 1 prestige? Now Nurse has a special effect when she blinks.  Or Pig has a new crouching animation. Make people feel rewarded for playing the game.\n\nRemove half of the perks from the game. Like really, Leauge of Legends had the similar issue with their stuff - there were a lot of runes and masteries that were hardly meaningful on it's own. Their reduced their number but each one of them has a greater impact on the game. \n\nWe need something like that, we really do, because there are a lot of so called meta perks and a lot of perks which are just trash and doesn't fit to the game mechanics anymore. A single perk that counter that single specific killer? What kind of a bad game design it is?\n\nThe same thing with items. Remove silly items and addons that has literally 0 meaning to the game, or just rework them to be actually useful. Again, less addons, but more impactful on the game. \n\nSome more animations would be cool. Like some hand gestures maybe aka \"Killer is near!\" or \"I'm fine, leave me alone.\" or \"Run away!\"... Perhaps some gestures for killers? I mean, yeah, that would be a playground for even more toxicity, but it's not the game's fault that the community is shitty. I mean, it is, but less mechanicaly, but more by design. \n\nWhat I mean is, the game is just frustrating at it's core. If you play as a killer and you play against four people who are on Discord, they just make a fool out of you. It's just not fun. Not at all. When you play as a survivor and a killer literally camps you, even if he has a single sacrifices at the end of the game - it's not fun either. \n\nGive more ways for survivors to hide and runaway. Pallets, windows and lockers are already boring enough. At the same time give a killer more ways to catch a survivors. A destroyable door was a step in the right direction, but it's still not exactly what it needs.\n\nAlso, we need different objectives... We really do. Repairing a generator after all these years is meh. I would love the game to be more like Among Us, I mean the minigame that requires you to progress further into the game needs some kind of effort from survivor's side. \n\nI could type out 10 more paragraphs like this.
