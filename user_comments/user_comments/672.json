In the nine remaining races, the 23-year-old is racing for his future in the series. According to RTL/ntv information, Schumacher will not get a new contract with his Haas team during the summer break for the time being. According to the report, team boss G\u00fcnther Steiner is no longer in a hurry to negotiate an extended contract with the driver.\n\nOne reason for this: Fernando Alonso's surprising move to Aston Martin. Sebastian Vettel's racing team was suddenly seen as a strong option for Schumacher after the four-time world champion announced his retirement at the end of the year. And as a powerful hand in the poker with Haas for a cockpit for 2023. But because the Englishmen prefer to have an experienced man at Lance Stroll's side, the weights on the market have shifted to Schumacher's disadvantage.\n\nHaas can now rely on the time factor, knowing full well that the US racing team is currently the only opportunity for the German to secure his place in next year's driver line-up. Although not all cockpits have been allocated yet, the 23-year-old does not have a serious chance next to Haas. It is possible that Team Alfa Romeo will make a move, but that is not certain. Guanyu Zhou has not yet been confirmed. But the Chinese brings a lot of sponsorship money with him and is having a good debut season. It is also unclear what will happen at Alpine after the chaos surrounding Oscar Piastri.\n\nAnd so the pressure on the German rider is increasing immensely. In the team-internal duel he is clearly behind Kevin Magnussen. In the qualifying duels, the Dane leads by 11:2 (!) and in the World Championship ranking he is also clearly ahead of Schumacher. Magnussen has scored 22 points, Mick only 12. After a small interim high in Silverstone and Spielberg (the only two races in which he scored points), the 23-year-old has recently failed to score twice. Steiner now expects a significant improvement from his youngster.\n\nAt the earliest, there could be talks about a new contract at the race weekend in Monza, from 9 to 11 September. But if Haas really decides against Schumacher, the premier class would be threatened with a season without a German (regular) driver for the first time since 1981 (!). The 23-year-old would still have the following option: substitute driver at Ferrari.

I got DeerPlus as well.\n\nOverall I'm really happy with it but it does have its flaws.\n\nPros:\n\n* The exercises are a fun way to learn and practise grammar.\n* It's challenging enough. They make you type the actual sentences with a Korean keyboard, for example.\n* There are also many reading and listening exercises, and the audio is great quality.\n* The interface and drawings are nice.\n* As for DeerPlus, it's more of a game-style. In my opinion it's very useful. The vocabulary lists are words that are commonly used in Korean (as opposed to apps like Drops for example). The grammar exercises are also great.\n\nCons:\n\n* The actual Lingodeer app is definitely more targeted towards grammar. For vocabulary, you need DeerPlus or another source.\n* The grammar explanations were great for the early levels, but once the grammar got more complex, I would have liked to see more in-depth explanation. So I now mainly use it as a practise app but not to learn the grammar itself.\n* It starts with teaching you the polite form of verbs, and only teaches the informal polite form later on. I found this a little bit confusing when studying alongside other resources as most of them teach you the informal form first.\n* DeerPlus has some pretty annoying sound effects.

I started learning Korean in February this year and tried tons of different resources. The ones that helped me out the most are:\n\n* Learning Hangul: this is where you should start! I'm assuming since you've been studying for a while you already know Hangul, but well just in case: I found How To Study Korean to be a good guide: [https://www.howtostudykorean.com/unit0/](https://www.howtostudykorean.com/unit0/) Afterwards, I practiced using this Memrise course: [https://app.memrise.com/course/124459/hangeul-hangeul-korean-alphabet-audio/](https://app.memrise.com/course/124459/hangeul-hangeul-korean-alphabet-audio/) (only the first few levels really) and also using the Drops app. You don't need to feel like a super fluent Hangul reader before continuing. I spent a few days on learning Hangul and then I felt like I could move on.\n* For grammar, I tried a bunch of resources, but my favourite is Lingodeer. It's not free, but in my opinion it's completely worth it (I paid about 70 dollars for a lifetime subscription, but I think you can try it out for a month for 15 bucks or something). The explanations are clear, the interface is fun to use, the audio is great. Most of all I enjoy all of the exercises, they're fun and give you a chance to actually practice what you've learned. I tried a ton of other resources, but at a beginner stage these were completely overwhelming to me. I just felt like I needed practice most of all.\n* I'm now doing Lingodeer simultaneously with the Go Billy beginner Korean course videos on Youtube. Would also definitely recommend his videos!\n* For vocabulary, I cannot recommend Anki enough. Before Anki, I was just picking up vocab from all sorts of resources, and it was hard to keep track of it all. I now add every new word I learn to my Anki deck, and I spend about 30 mins every day reviewing the words and learning 10 new words. I'm almost at 1000 words now! (may not seem like a lot but I'm proud of it haha) I have a plugin installed that adds audio to every word so that I also get the correct pronunciation. If you need specific tips on Anki, just let me know!\n* For adding new words to my vocabulary, I found the How To Study Korean vocabulary lists and My First 500 Korean Words from TTMIK a great place to start.\n\nI've also tried the following resources... among others:\n\n* Talk To Me In Korean: Many people recommend and love their podcasts, personally I'm not as much of a fan. It's always like a 15 minute podcast with 5 min of useful info and 10 mins of useless bantering. I much prefer Go Billy's videos for that reason.\n\n* How To Study Korean: Great for learning Hangul and also love their vocabulary lists, but the grammar explanations I found too overwhelming and complicated for a beginner.\n\n* Drops: It's a fun way to practice words you already know, but I would not recommend this as an actual vocab source. The trouble is many words are just too specific and not commonly used at all. I still use it, but I cherrypick the words that seem useful and press ignore on the rest.\n\n* DeerPlus: This is a companion app for Lingodeer. I think it's great, but not for complete beginners. You almost need to have gone through the Lingodeer course completely before starting on DeerPlus. I still don't feel ready for anything past the first couple levels.\n\n* DuoLingo: don't even bother, it's just crap haha.\n\nOf course everyone is different so what worked for me may not work for you.
