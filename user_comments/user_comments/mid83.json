I can understand the frustration given that I've been attempting to learn Spanish off and on for years now and I'm just now progressing out of beginner level content. It's easy to beat yourself up (I've done it plenty of times too) but it doesn't really serve us any good in the long run. You have nothing to be ashamed of! Anybody who claims language learning is easy is lying.\n\nIt might be a good idea to sit down and think about a few things. First, why do you want to learn Spanish? Keeping in in mind why you started this journey could help spur a little motivation and positive thinking. \n\nSecond, what do you enjoy doing on a day to day basic in your native language? Do you enjoy reading, listening to music or podcasts, watching TV series or movies? If you have a specific preference in one area then maybe look into adding something into your language learning plan that takes advantage of that interest. If it's reading, then look into something like Lingq or similar tools that focus on reading (they can also help with listening as well). If it's TV/movies, there are add ons for you can use that provide tools to help you learn via content on Netflix and other streaming services. These things don't need to be the only way you learn, but after doing more \"boring\" stuff some reading or watching can be much more fun and motivating to keep you going.\n\nThird, what are your goals with Spanish? Do you want to focus on being about read or watch TV/movies in Spanish? Do you want to be able to speak with Spanish speakers? Do you want to visit or live in a Spanish speaking country? These goals can also help you tailor what you need to do to get to a place with Spanish that you want. From your comment it sounds like you put a strong focus on speaking. If that's the case, then you may want to look into iTalki again but instead focus in on finding a tutor that will work with you on your speaking skills. I would email tutors you are interested in and let them know how you are feeling, what your goals are (ie. improving your speaking) and letting them know this is what you want to focus on. \n\nAt the end of the day, keep it up.

Some good series that teach various languages in English include Teach Yourself, Colloquial, and Assimil (this is actually a French company so the majority of their books are French based but they have around a dozen of so languages that they teach from English). These books have audio as part of the course and teach the language in a systematic way. The downside is that none of these books really go over material above around an intermediate level. \n\nMonolingual textbooks are ones that are written in the language that is being taught, so French textbooks are written in French, Spanish textbooks are written in Spanish and so on. In the case of French, you will find numerous French publishers that publish these textbooks. Monolingual textbooks are often used in language schools. The advantage is many of these courses are CEFR based and are part of a full program that teaches you material from A1 up to anywhere from B2 to C2. You can find textbooks that teach more advanced material than what you find with Teach Yourself or similar style bilingual courses. If you prefer a more structured curriculum in your language learning, monolingual textbooks can be excellent for that. \n\nThe disadvantage is that these books are typically written for classroom use, so some books are not great for self studying as the textbooks themselves might not provide as much information as you would expect since you are intended to get additional information/explanations from an instructor. Also, many activities in these textbooks are intended for groups or the entire class, which again  can be a negative for self study. The other disadvantage is the fact that since these books are monolingual, it can be tough for beginners. It's not impossible to learn from these at the beginning, you just need some extra time to use a dictionary or translator to help with instructions and grammar explanations. The other option would be to use something like Teach Yourself first, and then maybe jump into a monolingual series. \n\nIf you do look for a monolingual series, I would ask for French specific recs here on Reddit. There may be a series or two that is highly regarded. If not, you can look at a store like [Europeanbookshop.com](https://Europeanbookshop.com), sort by French, and they should have a wide range of courses to look into. I would look a the publisher's website, and you should be able to download a sample of the book's material (I would avoid any text that doesn't offer a free sample) and ensure that the book has enough material that can you self study with. Also these books often have supplementary exercise manuals with solutions in the back, which are very valuable for self learners. Try to avoid books that are too vague or have a huge amount of group content vs individual material. Also, ensure the audio is available via online download or CD with a copy of the book. If you pick a series with 4-6 textbooks, you could use the same series to learn material all the way up to B2-C2 depending on the series. That's why i think monolingual textbooks are worth a look if you prefer textbooks.\n\nFinally, even if you choose a textbook as a way to structure your curriculum, be sure you are incorporating a lot of native content along with your textbook studying, and finding a way to get speaking practice in (via meetups, italki lessons, language exchanges etc..)", "created_utc": "1659670868.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ij0d0xr", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_wg7841", "parent_id": "t3_wg7841", "score": "3", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "mid83", "body": "I\u2019m a native English speaker with two college degrees and I am a frequent reader.

I would end up getting frustrated because I'd be switching resources often, redoing the same basics over and over, and I would finally just quit.\n\nThis time, I've come into Spanish with a completely new mindset. I'm almost 40 and I think back on how advanced I could be at this point if I had stuck with it when I initially started around 34. There is no sense in worrying about the past, and instead I don't want another 5-6 years to pass with the same thoughts.

Of course everybody is different, but it seems like most people, 2-3 hours a day is the limit before your brain starts to turn to mush with intensive study. \n\nThere are a few things you can do in my opinion. For starters, I'm a fan of using multiple resources if you have more time to study each day. Let's say you have 2 hours of time to study each day. Rather than study one resource (Duolingo, a textbook, etc..) for those 2 hours, you can study two resources for an hour each or maybe even 3 resources for 40 minutes. Using multiple resources keeps me more engaged and it's less likely I'll get bored since I'm changing things up, even if the content is similar. Plus, each resource will teach things a little differently and likely in a bit of a different order, so that can help ingrain grammar or vocab. One resource may teach a concept better than another and vice versa. One big caveat is that you don't want to use too many resources or you are never going to progress from beginner concepts. For me, the sweet spot is 2-3 resources. Some people prefer just using one resource at a time, but I find it easier to study multiple hours a day if I'm changing things up.\n\nI'll also mention that you have to figure how much time you can study before you hit that point where you aren't retaining anything anymore. That that should be your limit on how much intense studying you do a day. Now I imagine you can probably increase that with time, especially if you haven't been in a school or studied for a long time (that's what happened with me...I haven't had a college course in 10 years so it took some time to get up to speed with studying). One thing that could help is splitting those productive hours up. If you have two hours to study but you find yourself getting exhausted after one hour, then maybe try to do an hour of study, give yourself a break, and then do another hour later in the day. Also, be sure you are taking breaks even if you can go for 2-3 hours in one sitting. A solid 10-15 minute break can really do wonders for your focus and concentration.\n\nFinally, just because your productive hours are used up doesn't mean you can't continue to engage with the language. This is the fun part and where immersion comes in. If you are watching a TV show or movie, try to watch something in your target language (or turn on the dub for that language if it's an English show/movie). At first I think it's fine to use English subtitles but try to switch over to subtitles in your target language as soon as possible. It's easy to just focus on the subtitles in English and ignore the language, especially since you aren't really doing intensive study at this point. Listen to music in your target language. Some people recommend switching your video games to your target language if you are a gamer. Change your phone's language to your target language. That stuff won't seem to help much at first but it will pay dividends over time.", "created_utc": "1658798103.0", "edited": "1658798325.0", "id": "ihnneb1", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_w83tjr", "parent_id": "t3_w83tjr", "score": "3", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "mid83", "body": "I personally find Babbel to be the best app for me, but it's not for everybody.

In my opinion it's the best in app SRS system I've come across compared to other apps like Busuu. If you hate making your own Anki cards, like I do, but want to get the benefit of SRS with the content you pick up in Babbel, it works well.\n\nI will note it does cost money, but you should be able to try out the first lesson of the various courses in the app so you can see if it works for you.

I'll answer it in a few ways.\n\n**1.) Will Cardano reach the current market cap of ETH (around $500 million) or BTC (a little under $1.2 trillion) one day?**\n\nI think this is very possible, especially the current ETH market cap of near $500 billion, if Cardano's long term plan works out and they become one of the 3rd gen blockchains of choice for developers. I don't think they need to beat or replace ETH or others like SOL to get there either. This is a big enough market for multiple players. \n\n**2.) Will Cardano \"surpass\" ETH (or even BTC) in market cap one day?**\n\nThis is a bit tougher, especially BTC, because I think BTC has a bright future as a store of value, especially if it eventually becomes a reserve currency for some counties (a possibility). \n\nIn regards to ETH, it depends on if they can make their platform the go to for Dapps/Defi once Cardano is fully on board. This is a tougher thing especially given competition from others like SOL and the eventual ETH 2.0 upgrade, along with all the support that ETH already has from developers (and SOL is quickly getting). \n\nA more realistic option in my opinion is that these platforms coexist but ETH maybe holds it's lead over Cardano currently.  \n\n**3.) Will Cardano ever reach the current prices of ETH (around $4220 a coin) or BTC ($62,800)?**\n\nCurrently, no. If ADA was around ETH's current price of $4220, the market cap would be around $137 trillion. As a comparison, global GDP is under $90 trillion. I don't even feel like doing the math for BTC's current price. They'd have to start burning coins like crazy to even reach those prices.\n\nRemember (for anybody wondering about the coin/token price), always look at market cap. Prices themselves don't matter really, you should focus on market cap. If ADA eventually reaches ETH's market cap, that means you will 7x your money at current prices.
