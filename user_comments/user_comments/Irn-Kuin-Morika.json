Have been learning Icelandic for 20 months and Finnish 8 months, and even though Finnish is not easy, personally Finnish and Icelandic has the same difficulties. Which is a bit surprising cause from a native English speaker\u2019s perspective, Finnish is generally considered more difficult than Icelandic. \n\n My Icelandic learning experience has been a bit disappointing for me, I definitely can achieve B2 by this time.

I intend to learn more intensively Finnish in next year to B2 level, which I think it\u2019s doable for me. \n\n I think the most difficulty aspect of both languages is definitely grammar, with verbs being more hardcore. Both have 6 group verbs. Finnish verbs have more grammatical cases as well as phonetical rules to apply to. They are definitely more predictable than Icelandic verbs though. I have no idea what type of group a particular Icelandic verb belong to if I don\u2019t know it before. Adjectives and nouns are the same things, with Finnish having more rules and Icelandic being more unpredictable. In different aspects, Finnish spoken language is different than its written one, but Icelandic high-quality resources are harder to find.

However Vietnamese script shows what the tones are, so it\u2019s easier to associate the tones than Chinese, I guess? That\u2019s why there are people who are thinking in \u201ctones\u201d\n\nAnyway if you can\u2019t understand anything after 6 months of learning, it\u2019s normal.

Actually when i reported this to the police, i'm actually confused as fuck (like it is supposed to be a transfer or a cheque? I later decided to believe the bank and it was the cheque). I hope that the English version could be helpful for you.\n English version: \n So my story begins with a guy named A. He borrowed \u20ac900 from me until 28/01. In the 28/01 he told me he would receive a bonus of \u20ac2,800 from his boss (who is called J). So A is supposed to work for J on 24/02, but as A told J that A has money problems to solve, J has said he is okay with sending it.\n\n Since A is in debt, he cannot transfer the money (he intended to send the rent to someone who is M). So I received the money by the transfer (it was supposed to be by cheque, but I don't know how to do it, so I was advised to transfer by transfer) in 01/02. Afterwards, I transferred the \u20ac1500 to M, \u20ac400 by transcash to A, and \u20ac900 I kept myself for the refund. During that time, I transferred \u20ac1800 to A for him to pay for everything he needs (rent, new phone ...) (That \u20ac1800 has nothing to do with \u20ac2800 cheque)\n\nBut in the 03/02, I checked my account, and I realized the cheque was opposed. And then when I went to the bank in the 04/02, I was explained that this is a stolen cheque and I am a victim of fraud.\n\nAs my bank told me, I tried to file a complaint with several police officers, but partly that I did not explain well (this story is complicated and I do not speak French fluently), a part that the police officers did not totally help me, I haven't succeeded in making the complaint yet. I would like to bring the complaint against J as he already knew that it is a stolen check. I want to take the complaint to A too, but I don't want to risk filing a complaint against the wrong person. A part, he helped me identify more of J's info, but another part I'm afraid he lied to me to seem make him seems like a reliable person. And that he always told me to trust his lawyer (T), and he told me that, for fraud situation, you should trust the lawyer rather than the policeman? \n\n So in total i lost 4600 euros, in which 2800 euros are from the cheque, and 1800 euros from the borrowing of A.", "created_utc": "1612556045.0", "edited": "1612557016.0", "id": "gm5ltx4", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_ldf2s3", "parent_id": "t1_gm5j3da", "score": "2", "subreddit": "france", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhjz"}, {"author": "Irn-Kuin-Morika", "body": " J'ai \u00e9t\u00e9 stupide de lui faire confiance quand on a rencont\u00e9 sur Internet pour seulement 2 semaines.

The Czech Republic is full of culture. People here are mostly not just beach bums, this is a highly educated nation and there are so many musicians in this country. I'm also not talking about guitarists who can strum a few chords, I mean really musical literacy. There are theaters everywhere and they're accessible to the average person. \n\nCulture doesn\u00b4t stop only with \u00b4\u00b4music\u00b4\u00b4 you know. And in terms of music i thought Austria always has a lead\n\n\\>The educational levels here are really high and a lot of innovation comes out of this country. A very recent example is this Coronavirus crisis, where Czech scientists have contributed massively to breakthroughs. Why? Can we agree that education here is taking seriously. \n\nThe educational levels and innovation in Czechia is good comparing to the world but still below average in EU. Nordic countries should have taken a lead in here. Or maybe Swizterland\n\n\\>You can also see this with technology. Ostrava has the largest data center in Europe. Many great software programs and even games come from the Czech Republic. Many American companies have also moved their IT presence here to the Czech Republic. Dell and Verizon for example. \n\nI won\u00b4t comment here cause don\u00b4t know a lot of it.\n\n\\>Crime rates here are low and there's a very good quality of life. People here seem to know what's important and how to live in peace. \n\nCzechia is very safe but it has no doors to Iceland, Finland, Estonia, some Gulf countries, Japan, Taiwan... in terms of safety\n\n\\>The people here are non confrontational and polite. You hardly ever see Czech people screaming or shouting, even when they're drunk they behave themselves. I would say the Czech people are the most civilized people I've ever come across. They greet for example when entering an elevator. The men here still let women enter through doors first. Kids will still offer a seat to an elderly person on a tram.\n\nIt is subjective, but i don\u00b4t agree to the last 2 sentences and 1st sentence, i think we should treat people equally as much as possible. For me the most civilized culture are egalitarian. And if by your definitions, shouldn\u00b4t East Asian countries be taken credit for them being civilized, non confrontational and polite. Czech certainly don\u00b4t reach that level yet\n\n\\>Let's talk about Czech kids. In my entire time on this planet I have never come across better behaved kids than Czech kids. The children here are absolutely golden. This is proven now after 15 years of living here. I remember seeing all kinds of nasty behavior from kids in some other countries, but in Czech Republic I really love how good these kids are.\n\nIt is also subjective. And a bit too generalistic. Again if by being better behaved shouldn\u00b4t East Asian countries be superior in that sense\n\n\\>I also like how everyone leaves you alone in public. No Czech person would come and just start randomly talking to you to pass time or annoy you. They just know exactly how to respect your space and your time.\n\nIt\u00b4s good but it\u00b4s not that special. Nordic countries, Slavic countries, East Asian countries come to mind for me\n\n\\>I would also say the average mental health here is very good and this starts with Czech family. It's really close and Czech people have really excellent family values. Family here is important and for life.\n\nI could tell 100 countries that have better excellent family values than Czechia. Even though i prefer Czechia\u00b4s balance between collectivism and independance\n\n\\>Czech people love their beer sure. But most foreigners are surprised that Czech people aren't just about drinking all the time. Real Czech people actually are not drinking all the time. They're usually active. Active with work, or fixing their house or walking in nature or just always doing something. It's almost unheard of for Czech people to just sit around and do nothing.\n\nNo comments here. \n\n\\>Czech people also are kind of handy. They have a can do approach to things like fixing stuff or DIY projects. Even something like \"build your own house\", not many Czechs would say that's totally impossible, but many would say I could do it with some help here and there.\n\nIf every person is like that then that\u00b4s actually a very good point. But then i remember all other Slavic countries are like that?\n\n\\>And when you become part of this great nation the Czech mentality and culture will become part of you too.\n\nReplace Czech vs every other country and it would still makes sense\n\n\\>One thing I still say the only real disadvantage I've found here is that the language is really very complex. Otherwise I would classify it as the best country on earth.\n\nOther Slavic countries, especially Slovak, disagree with that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOverall this is not to humilitate u but to show u that if u consider \u00b4\u00b4?\u00b4\u00b4 to be the best country, then you have to show its special points. If not then you should have just said \u00b4\u00b4 Czechia is my favorite country\u00b4\u00b4", "created_utc": "1598905317.0", "edited": "False", "id": "g3ifkx1", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_ijv3ln", "parent_id": "t3_ijv3ln", "score": "3", "subreddit": "czech", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qiht"}, {"author": "Irn-Kuin-Morika", "body": "Estonians/Czechs here?", "created_utc": "1598615181.0", "edited": "False", "id": "g34igc5", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_ii37yt", "parent_id": "t1_g34dds7", "score": "1", "subreddit": "unitedkingdom", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhqb"}, {"author": "Irn-Kuin-Morika", "body": "From France", "created_utc": "1598615044.0", "edited": "False", "id": "g34ia6h", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_ii1pdg", "parent_id": "t3_ii1pdg", "score": "1", "subreddit": "jacksepticeye", "subreddit_id": "t5_2za58"}, {"author": "Irn-Kuin-Morika", "body": "Oh ok i understand.", "created_utc": "1598614918.0", "edited": "False", "id": "g34i4nb", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_ihu0y6", "parent_id": "t1_g34i0mu", "score": "1", "subreddit": "AskEurope", "subreddit_id": "t5_2uayg"}, {"author": "Irn-Kuin-Morika", "body": "I thought people in Europe would know Georgia as a country, not a state?", "created_utc": "1598613676.0", "edited": "False", "id": "g34gn42", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_ihu0y6", "parent_id": "t1_g3486tq", "score": "4", "subreddit": "AskEurope", "subreddit_id": "t5_2uayg"}, {"author": "Irn-Kuin-Morika", "body": "Wish Taiwan a better future", "created_utc": "1598562582.0", "edited": "False", "id": "g32dgto", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_ihmcpw", "parent_id": "t3_ihmcpw", "score": "9", "subreddit": "taiwan", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhrg"}, {"author": "Irn-Kuin-Morika", "body": "Thich Nhat Hanh u mean?", "created_utc": "1598405112.0", "edited": "False", "id": "g2v5j3r", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_igeilo", "parent_id": "t1_g2tiehl", "score": "2", "subreddit": "Buddhism", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhnf"}, {"author": "Irn-Kuin-Morika", "body": "As a South American country, Uruguay is very positively unusual\n\nHappy Independence Day :)))", "created_utc": "1598403227.0", "edited": "False", "id": "g2v24ya", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_igeonb", "parent_id": "t3_igeonb", "score": "4", "subreddit": "MapPorn", "subreddit_id": "t5_2si92"}, {"author": "Irn-Kuin-Morika", "body": "I thought Seychelles, Mauritius r fine too.
