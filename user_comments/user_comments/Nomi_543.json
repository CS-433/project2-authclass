Hebrew Revival was tied to the Haskalah, or Jewish Enlightenment, and to Zionism. All three movements were part of a larger wave of Jewish nationalism and attempts to revitalize and protect Jewish communities in the face of centuries of antisemitism, which was spiking in the 1880s in the Russian Empire, where many, many Jews lived.\n\nIn addition to this movement, many Jews already were fluent in Hebrew. Being able to read the Tanakh is crucial to a Jewish education, which in turn is crucial to a Jewish life. This Hebrew was used as a liturgical language, while Jews spoke other languages natively. Most Ashkenazi Jews spoke Yiddish (Judeo-German) and Sephardi Jews spoke Ladino (Judeo-Spanish). Jews in America tended to speak Yiddish or English, particularly the latter if they were younger. Outside of these groups, it depended largely on the nation, but dialects from Judeo-Arabic to Judeo-Malayalam and Judeo-Kurdish thrived. \n\nIn 1948, Israel was a brand-new nation dealing with an absurd amount of people. From 1948 to 1958, over a million Jews flooded into the country. 110,000 of those had arrived between May 1948 and January 1949. My source for these numbers is the Jewish Virtual Library. \n\nFrom 1948-52, over 350,000 immigrants came from Muslim countries and largely spoke Ladino or Judeo-Arabic. 300,000 came from \u201ccommunist satellite states\u201d, and 33,000 from western states. This did not include the USSR. Jews from communist states largely spoke Yiddish.\n\nBy May of 1952, in the wake of 800,000 Jews being  expelled from Muslim countries, 220,000 Israeli Jews lived in transition camps, 80% of them from Muslim countries. That is, quite obviously, a lot of people. \n\nAnd so, Israel had many, many new residents who despised their former countries, sought to forge a tighter-knit Jewish people, and could not speak each other\u2019s languages. The answer was obvious. Hebrew was taught to those who did not already speak it, and adapted for everyday use for those who did. The new Israeli dialect was based largely on Sephardi Hebrew, with some Ashkenazi and Yemenite influence. The government conducted a massive campaign of Hebraization, and it worked. Modern Israelis rarely speak Yiddish or Ladino, except for the old, and some Hasidic Ashkenazi communities that still use Yiddish. Many Israelis also changed their last names to Hebrew ones. To use a famous example, the Gadot family name used to be Greenstein. \n\nIreland, while it has a populace of people who care deeply about their population and their country, did not have major communication issues.

I am, however, extremely involved in diversity, equity, and inclusion work, and I\u2019ve studied the history of racism extensively on my own. While I have never heard nor read someone explicitly state why this term did not gain a larger following, I think such an answer can be deduced from what I have read and studied. \n\nTo understand this, you must first understand where the concept of \u201crace\u201d came from. When you step back from a modern lens, where much of white America has assimilated into a uniform culture, it is easier to see that Europe doesn\u2019t have all that much in common. Allow me to clarify. In the seventeenth through twentieth centuries, two random immigrants from Europe were almost certainly not from the same country. They did not speak the same language, they did not share a culture, many followed different streams of Protestantism, or were Catholic or Jewish- more on those groups later. So how and why did all these groups become merged into \u201cwhite\u201d, or \u201cEuropean-American\u201d, rather than staying unique? It was in opposition to \u201cBlack\u201d people, or \u201cAfrican-Americans\u201d. Captured slaves were in the same position as willing (or indentured) European immigrants. They came from a wide variety of cultures, nations, and peoples. To Europeans, however, their humanity was unimportant, only their ability to work. Ibram X. Kendi\u2019s \u201cStamped from the Beginning\u201d covers how a uniform \u201cBlack\u201d identity was forced onto slaves and their children by stripping them from their native cultures and dumping them into a single legal category designed to forcibly extract labor. Read the text of the laws that dictated racial discrimination. There is no mention of Senegambians or Nigerians, only Black people- or less kind terms. To go farther back, James Carroll\u2019s (forgive a typo of his last name, if I made one) \u201cConstantine\u2019s Sword: The Church and the Jews\u201d discusses how the Spaniards invented the modern concept of blood and ancestry being more important than nationality and religion when they began to hunt down and/or persecute ethnic Jews who had converted to Christianity and their descendants. Religion (Catholicism) and nation (Spain) were no longer the sole factors, their blood (Jewish) was more meaningful. \n\nAll this to say that \u201cwhiteness\u201d developed as a category opposed to \u201cblackness\u201d, neither of which really exist on their own, at least not in a way like ethnicity or religion. A Black man from Florida and Kenya have nothing in common whatsoever beyond what unites us all has humans. Neither does an American, descended from Englishmen, and a Russian. But to a modern American, they\u2019re both \u201cblack\u201d and \u201cwhite\u201d. If Black people were to be seen as inferior, a superior category needed to be devised. To do this, phrenology and other psuedo-sciences were developed and pursued. Kendi functionally says that these \u201csciences\u201d were made to make white people feel better about themselves and justify their horrific actions. Darwin\u2019s new theory of evolution, and his cousin\u2019s application of this to race, helped these new \u201cscientific fields\u201d. \n\nNow that we know how Blackness and Whiteness came to be, we can discuss why Black people are African-American, and white people are just white. These categories were made in the first place to implement and justify the subjugation of Black people and other \u201cnon-white\u201d races. Note that I am using the language of race because, like all social constructs, though it may have little or no biological basis, it does have a profound impact on sociology and how we interact with one another. \n\nWhite people in the US largely just see themselves as Americans. This country is built for white people, and though the definition of white has expanded (mostly to include the Irish and Italians), there has never been doubt in this society\u2019s \u201cmind\u201d that white people are citizens of the United States both culturally and politically. If they do not identify as purely Americans, it is, as you said, usually by a more specific term (Italian-American, Polish-American, etc) rather than as European-American. If a white person in the US knows enough about their ancestors\u2019 culture to still identify with it, they also know that Europe is not a monolith. A Russian-American and a French-American are different. Why would a Pole or Italian in this country identify only as European-American? However, our society, built for white people, sees cultures outside its own as a monolith, as so many cultures do. The Romans called everyone who wasn\u2019t Roman a barbarian, as if any two groups were really alike. African-Americans (who are descendants of slaves rather than recent immigrants) have had their African cultures stripped from them and can no longer know which they come from, let alone identify with them. Immigrants and their descendants (including those from the West Indies who are ultimately descended from slaves) often do identify with their specific culture, even if the society as a whole still brands them as African-American. The same can be said of Asian cultures. The individuals may identify either with a nation or Asia as a whole, and the cultures are clearly different, but the dominant white American culture will see them as more or less monolithic. If it did not, the term \u201cAsian-American\u201d wouldn\u2019t be seen as useful.\n\nIn short, white Americans are either too assimilated and descended from too many nations to identify with their specific cultures and purely see themselves as white rather than connected to Europe, or they do identify with the specific culture and don\u2019t see the point in connecting to Europe as a whole. Black people (descended from American slaves) don\u2019t have a choice in the matter, Black or African-American is the only cultural group that there is a connection to. The \u201cback to Africa\u201d movement and other political movements of the 60s through the 80s worked hard to connect Black people to their homeland and each other- but finding specific cultures was still largely impossible, and no one would have been descended from only one culture anyways.", "created_utc": "1660325008.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ik0qjfm", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_wmid5b", "parent_id": "t3_wmid5b", "score": "18", "subreddit": "AskHistorians", "subreddit_id": "t5_2ssp3"}, {"author": "Nomi_543", "body": "Congratulations, you made a map that will cause even more Wars than Sykes-Picot", "created_utc": "1660276804.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ijyaoql", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_wm9gcy", "parent_id": "t3_wm9gcy", "score": "-2", "subreddit": "imaginarymaps", "subreddit_id": "t5_2vqof"}, {"author": "Nomi_543", "body": "Please, I am begging you, do not commit a crime overseas for this purpose.

Judah was the southern kingdom of the Israelites, formed after the United Monarchy of Saul, David, Solomon, etc split into two. The northern kingdom was called Israel (Yisra\u2019el in Hebrew). Israel was conquered by Assyria and its people deported or subjugated. Ten of the twelve Tribes of Israel had lived in the Kingdom of Israel, two lived in the Kingdom of Judah- this is where the whole \u201cTen Lost Tribes\u201d thing came from. History tells us they just got assimilated into Assyria. \n\nModern Jews are the descendants of those who lived in Judah. Samaritans are the descendants of those who lived in the Northern Kingdom of Israel. Both are descended from the Israelites (Yisraelim in Hebrew, meaning people from Israel), who in turn were a branch of the Hebrews, who in turn were a branch of the Canaanites. Jews and Samaritans are the only remaining Hebrew peoples, and only remaining Canaanites (though the Phoenicians and Carthaginians had a good run).

The Jews fought alongside them, and were also crushed. Many Jews had already been exiled outside of the Holy Land/Eretz Yisra\u2019el/Palestine/Roman Judaea, but the Samaritans had not. The Samaritans never really recovered from that Genocide and number less than 2000 today. \n\nYou are correct, however, about the doctrinal differences.

There are some truly terrible books in post-ROTJ (the Crystal Star, children of the Jedi, a few others), and whatever you do, don\u2019t touch Jedi Prince, but most of what I haven\u2019t already mentioned is just mediocre. Worth the read if you have the time/money but not great or awful. \n\nThese books are not without their flaws. Most notably, the continuity issues are there, especially with the prequels. You have to learn to ignore them. The overwhelming majority of the characters are white, the men are (usually) the main characters, and some key female characters are infamously sidelined in NJO. Stackpole\u2019s half of X-Wing in particularly is very very sexual, by which it means it objectifies all the women in it and describes their beauty in close detail. I still enjoy these books, however.\n\nAlmost everything post-NJO is awful. Dark Nest and Legacy of the Force in particular. Horrible stories, butchered characters. One of the main NJO characters becomes a pedo. That\u2019s not even an exaggeration. Lots of arcs are thrown out the window to keep the story going.
