My Interceptor will run around 4k on the highway. It\u2019s a little higher than I\u2019d like for a highway tourer, but not terrible and you don\u2019t feel it too much. My buddy\u2019s T120 still runs in the 3-3.5k range on the highway, it\u2019s not as big of a difference as you might think despite being almost double the engine size.

It\u2019s a 2015 and we cracked 2k miles on the RE on this trip. I also have a Interceptor at home in Connecticut. I feel pretty confident about the 650 now but I did have one rough breakdown at 150 miles. The oil cooler broke and leaked, which was a huge mess and ruined a pair of riding pants. It was fixed under warranty but it took a while for the dealer to acquire parts so it was out of commission for three weeks. So that kind of issue would be terrible on a long trip. However, (assuming the maintenance supervisor at my dealer wasn\u2019t just blowing smoke), he told me that mine was his second warranty repair out of all of the 650s that they had sold, and the other was a faulty fuel gauge. Since I got it back, it\u2019s been good and reliable. I don\u2019t really have any tips other than make sure you do all of your regular maintenance checks and give yourself time to take care of problems if you find them. We had to leave late because we discovered the rear brake pads on the T120 were spent and getting the pads required some searching.", "created_utc": "1636834189.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hkhug4o", "is_submitter": "True", "link_id": "t3_qt20os", "parent_id": "t1_hkhhbhy", "score": "3", "subreddit": "royalenfield", "subreddit_id": "t5_2tlx7"}, {"author": "mrseitz", "body": "I visited a friend in Tampa, FL and we took his Classic 500 and Triumph T120 to Key West.

It was since I had been riding and I always try to be extra cognizant of bikers as I\u2019m aware of the problem. I head checked three times before I decided to go, and I\u2019m guessing he was just perfectly hidden (or at least his headlight was) behind the turning car, but I started to pull out and saw him for the first time when he swerved to avoid me. He got right around me without an incident and just kept on riding, but I was so upset that I had to pull over and I honestly thought I was going to vomit. Like I said, it would have 100% been my fault if an accident had occurred, but there was no intent to do anything shitty, I just straight up didn\u2019t see him until it was too late, despite me trying to be extra careful at a dangerous intersection. It\u2019s definitely a situation that I\u2019m going to be more careful about in the future. \n\nWhen I was the bicyclist, a car passed me super close and then dead stopped to take a left hand turn. However, they did that weird thing where they swung right to prepare for the left hand turn, so they completely closed my travel lane. I was going down hill fast on skinny road tires and just didn\u2019t have the traction to stop that fast, so I bailed into a driveway, wiped out when I hit the grass, and skidded long enough to cross another driveway and come to a stop in the next yard. I looked up after stopping, visibly injured (though not seriously) and with a visibly unrideable bicycle, and I was past the car still waiting to take a left, and she had no clue that I was there or that anything had happened. I was obviously angry, but I don\u2019t think any of it was intentional. After she passed me, I was old news and she was no longer considering me in her driving. And she was so focused on making her turn safely that she didn\u2019t even see my wiping out past her, well within her field of view. \n\nAnyway, I guess my point is that it is certainly more dangerous to be on a smaller, less visible vehicle without the safety of a metal cage, seat belts, and airbags. And it is certainly infuriating when someone compromises your safety, regardless of intent, but I do think that much of the issue is more related to visibility/invisibility of a smaller vehicle than it is related to a lack of respect for smaller vehicles or even incompetence/inattentiveness.", "created_utc": "1629037316.0", "edited": "False", "id": "h917oog", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_p4sdpu", "parent_id": "t3_p4sdpu", "score": "2", "subreddit": "motorcycles", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qi6d"}, {"author": "mrseitz", "body": "Have you looked at Alpha Cars?

It is also an official language of the U.N. and is probably the most widespread both in number of speakers and number of places it could be useful in, due to second language speakers in the former Soviet sphere of influence. \n\n2 - Turkish: A regional power involved in much of the happenings in the MENA region, and more of a niche than Russian. If you are interested in the region specifically, that could be a reason to elevate this to your number 1. \n\n3 - Hungarian: Not comparatively important for U.S. foreign policy issues, but definitely an interesting niche language. \n\n4 - Greek: Maybe slightly more important foreign policy-wise, but I rated it lower because there are A LOT of second language speakers of Greek in the U.S., so that takes some of the points away for the niche concept. \n\n5 - German: I considered rating this 3rd, as Germany is obviously an important nation in E.U. affairs, but I knocked it down because it\u2019s likely the most commonly studied language by Americans on your list, the easiest to learn on your list, and I would guess that it\u2019s one of the most competitive postings (at least compared to the countries that speak the other languages on your list).
