I\u2019ll check for that site and edit this post to make sure I didn\u2019t miss anything\n\nAs for the process, I showed up when they opened.

I went, got lost, eventually finished it all after like an hr and a half stressfully looking for this place cause her directions were wrong.

Now Jun 2018 I am definitely proficient in Spanish but not fluent so yes it is possible to learn in your 20s!!!! It is a lot of work tho!\n\nStarted kinda learning at 23 (Jan 2017), got serious in March 2017 and got a tutor (he\u2019s on reddit u/smokedupmirrors) and met with him twice a week until March of this year. I did this while studying/consuming Spanish media almost everyday. I can\u2019t recommend Anki enough, I was hesitant about the $29 price but if you use it often it\u2019s great cause you can make flash cards on your comp with words, pictures, and audio and review them on the go with your phone. As for Spanish media, there is soooo much. DreamingSpanish is on YouTube and is great for starting out because he draws/acts out his stories and slowly you start picking up more vocab. From here I moved to easyspanish. It has subtitles in both English and Spanish, but by the time I started using it I didn\u2019t need them to understand the gist of what they were saying so I would make it large and hide the subs below the bottom of the screen. I had a half hr for lunch each day so I would generally spend it watching their videos. I watched a bunch of other YouTube but can\u2019t remember them. Long story short idk what happened but one day it just clicked on one of the videos and what they were saying in harder videos started making sense (this was maybe September 2017). At this point I still couldn\u2019t understand everything, but I was understanding the idea of most things. I also was basically listening to only Spanish music (which I don\u2019t think is supper helpful for learning other than learning to separate words because it\u2019s too fast). I had loca radio stations in Spanish and while I didn\u2019t understand the music or all of the conversations, the ads were useful.\n\nFinally, I used HelloTalk to find language partners with the accents I was interested in and I would text them through WhatsApp (one Day Spanish and one English). We\u2019d also Skype once a week for a half hr with 15 mins English and 15 mins Spanish.\n\nLong story short, by the time I moved to Chile at the start of April this year I could have conversations and express what I wanted but definitely didn\u2019t understand everything. Group convos were tough, but my tutor gave me a great tip to focus on the person who was speaking the most and then it\u2019s like a 1v1 with side comments.\n\nThis was all within a year (I was 24 when I moved), and honestly the most helpful thing was my tutor. I would be no where near where I needed to be if it wasn\u2019t for his classes that were fully in Spanish. At this point, I\u2019m no where near fully fluent and am just starting to tackle the subjunctive, but I can have conversations with the native Chileans (and their tough accent) and understand probably 90% of 1v1 convos and 80% of group convos (By this I mean I understand what the idea is all the time but like I don\u2019t understand some words). So to answer your question yes it is 100% possible to learn in your 20s!!!!

This probably won't be a popular position but the health risk to the neighbors is highly dependent on whether the contamination is in the soil or groundwater and its concentrations. If it's in the soil but not the groundwater then most of the contamination is probably contained to the site. The other properties that surround the site would only really be contaminated if the pcbs were air bone when they were used and landed on their soils (by airborne I mean like they sprayed it into stuff outdoors and the wind blew it down wind). If the contamination is in the groundwater (by groundwater I mean no matter where you are these water in the soil about 3-15 feet below the ground), then that's a whole different story because it can spread through the groundwater. The spreading also depends on the type of soils because groundwater can flow easier through sands than clay because sands are more porous. Regardless, if it does spread in the groundwater it still might not be an serious hazard to residents unless it is giving off vapors (which can be tested for) or has contaminated the soils in the area its migrated to or if you drink well water. But yea there's a lot of variables in play and a lot of standards are sooo strict that you have something like a one in a million chance to experience health effects from it. Again, I wouldn't wanna live there lol but yea the risk can be low if these results are just above standard. And with them not releasing it, I can't do much speak for Quebec because I work in New Jersey (I studied in Montreal) but it does eventually become public record once their final remedial investigation report is completed (again there's an ethical issue here, but if they believe there is an immediate environmental concern to you they are required to notify you). Sorry to rant but I figured I'd give some context on it. And just a general fyi if you eat fish you already have a low level of pcbs in your body.
