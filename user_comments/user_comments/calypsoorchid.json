Depending on your possibilities of living in a francophone environment, that may mostly be content like TV/movies/podcasts.\n\nEven if you are able to live in a majority-francophone area, I think passive listening is really unparalleled. I struggled with my listening skills for a long time even though I was often immersed in Spanish-speaking environments; part of this was because I was so nervous about missing something when someone would speak to me that I was hyperfocused on making sure that I at least got the gist, in addition to being way too hard on myself if I didn\u2019t understand something and had to ask someone to repeat themselves, and thus was less able to focus on absorbing new vocab, grammar, slang, nuances in ways of speaking etc. Passive entertainment has been a charm for this, I can listen stress-free and really focus in on what I do and don\u2019t understand.", "created_utc": "1652021340.0", "edited": "1652025601.0", "id": "i7swed4", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_ukwbyc", "parent_id": "t3_ukwbyc", "score": "1", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "calypsoorchid", "body": "I like it, keep \u2018em coming.", "created_utc": "1651956902.0", "edited": "False", "id": "i7py7uf", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_ukkjs9", "parent_id": "t3_ukkjs9", "score": "20", "subreddit": "Spanish", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qtt1"}, {"author": "calypsoorchid", "body": "Sinverg\u00fcenza", "created_utc": "1651946508.0", "edited": "False", "id": "i7pb9q7", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_ue2iip", "parent_id": "t3_ue2iip", "score": "1", "subreddit": "Spanish", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qtt1"}, {"author": "calypsoorchid", "body": "Watch movies!!
