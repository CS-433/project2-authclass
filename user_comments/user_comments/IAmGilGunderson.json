I have been studying Italian for 10 years off and on. With gaps of many years between each restart. Each time I restarted in the past I would go back to the beginning and learn from scratch whether I needed it or not.\n\nThe current bout of learning started in 2019 and I have been doing at least 1.5 hours per week. But sometimes as many as 10 hours per week.  [Here is what I have been doing this last 6mos or so](/r/IAmGilGunderson/comments/v0yfc5/path_from_a2_to_b1_and_beyond/) to get out of my A2 rut.\n\nI count any time engaged with the language in my made up numbers.

I can read materials designed for B1 with very little difficulty. I do not practice speaking enough so that drags me down to A2 level of spoken interaction. But you could put me in Italy today and I could get by just fine except for complicated situations. The tendency for most people is to overestimate their CEFR level. I tend to underestimate mine.\n\nFinally learning language is a hobby for me. I do not treat it like a job. I do not go as fast as I can. I take my time.

The series is named after its protagonist, an anti-heroic thief, inspired by several previous pulp fiction characters from Italy and other countries. Its stories consist of monthly black-and-white, digest-sized volumes.\"\n\n[Hollywood on the Tiber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood_on_the_Tiber) and all that it spawned. Not everyone is into retro films but I certainly am. \n\nOne of my favorite genres is [Peplum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sword-and-sandal) aka Sword-and-Sandal aka costume dramas, big muscled men and women doing incredible feats of strength. More were made in Italy then anywhere else. Many are [free to view online](https://www.youtube.com/c/PEPLUMTV/videos). And around a [hundred in Italian](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_ip4tli3pJVBflgIP9zxo9lEd8WIYeOY) completely free and legal. I understand that not everyone is into them. Which is fine by me.\n\nItalian Horror is right up there with British Gothic Horror as far as my favorites go. With [Mario Bava](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mario_Bava) being one of my favorites. He gave us wonderful Peplum as well as horror.  He even gave us \"Black Sabbath\" which the metal band took their name from.  Other favorites are of course Dario Argento and Lucio Fulci.

You have to practice all the time and figure out how to properly link them in your mind.\n\nYou might find some people sharing their mnemonics. But for me the problem with using other peoples mnemonics is that it doesn't stick. They have to be mine and they have to be personal to really stay in my brain.\n\nSee the [Art Of Memeroy e-boo](https://artofmemory.com/files/ebooklet/Learn_the_Art_of_Memory.pdf) also see the full [art of memory](https://artofmemory.com/) website.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAs an example lets take the word 'orgoglioso' in Italian. Which is an adjective that means proud or haughty according to a translating dictionary. \n\nMy first advice is caution. Just because a dictionary says what a word means that don't ever just trust a translating dictionary. It is ok to memorize it for future use in reading or listening. But keep in mind that once you encounter it in the wild so to speak your idea of it might change. Use the mnemonics mainly for comprehension rather than production. Let the production flow from having seen it used in comprehension.\n\nThe second thing is that since I am a native speaker, I am trying to relate it back to something in english. \n\nSo if I take 'orgoglioso' it kinda sounds like ogre in english. So when I see or hear the word an image of a lovable proud ogre comes to mind. Shreck. Now the glioso part of the word. When learning Italian everyone told me \"gli\" was pronounced liked 'milliionarie' (they were wrong for my pronunciation but that is another thing) So now I picture that same proud Shreck holding a stack of cash and wearing a top hat and spats. 'oso' is similar to an Italian word I already know  'osso' which means bone. So now in my image of Shreck holding the stack of cash in a top hat I add him holding a cane made of a femur or bone of a mythical creature. \n\nAnother thing I do when it is a noun is needing to be memorized I use a trick from someone somewhere. Masculine nouns are on Exploding. Feminine nous are on Fire. Neuter Nouns are frozen.\n\nLastly. Mnemonics are great. But they rarely stick around for too long.

learning\ntechniques\n* Principle 4: Keep motivated and work hard\u2013Do what needs to be done\n\n&nbsp;\n\nYou need to spend equal amounts of time on each of the four strands:\n\n* 1 learning from meaning-focused input (listening and reading)\n* 2 learning from meaning-focused output (speaking and writing)\n* 3 language-focused learning (studying pronunciation, vocabulary, grammar etc)\n* 4 fluency development (getting good at using what you already know)\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nAfter that the subreddit FAQ and guide are very usefu.", "created_utc": "1663530776.0", "edited": "False", "id":

There are 4 skills. Reading, Writing, Listening, and Speaking. Each of them should be practiced in roughly equal parts.  \n\nReading is usually the easiest for most people. Graded readers are the best way to get a good start reading. [Example](https://www.blackcat-cideb.com/en/catalogue/german/graded-readers-en/level-a1-en/)\n\nWriting is very good to practice once you are at a decent intermediate level. There are write streak subreddits where people will correct your daily writings.\n\nListening can be hard to practice. My favorite way is to listen to the audiobook version of my graded readers. I read each chapter multiple times. With and without audio. And out loud.  But you should also take time to listen to native content once your level is high enough.\n\nSpeaking is by far the most difficult to practice since it really takes a 2nd person to practice. And the quality of the practice varies by the individual. The most important thing to keep in mind is to try to speak using what you already know. If you don't know the word for shoe, then say something like \"the thing you put on your feet\" and have the other person prompt you for the word. Avoid thinking that there is a perfect word that would fit where you want it and obsessing over finding it, until you are much higher level.\n\n\nMore than anything I highly recommend reading  [What do you need to know to learn a foreign language?](https://www.wgtn.ac.nz/lals/resources/paul-nations-resources/paul-nations-publications/publications/documents/foreign-language_1125.pdf) by Paul Nation.

I read a graded reader from a level below my current level. Since I am A2 I take a A1 graded reader. I read a chapter and translate it into my native language (English.) Then wait a day or two and translate the chapter back into the target language without looking anything up or using any other aids. Then I compare the translation that I wrote to the original. It is great practice because it has instant feedback from the original.\n\nI also do **monologue practice**. I pick a subject and record myself speaking about the subject in my target language for X minutes. At first I did 3, then 5, soon I will do 10 mins.  If I don't know a word I just use a native language word as a filler knowing I will look it up later. I try to speak as quickly as I can about the subject without looking anything up. And if I get stuck I try to talk around the word. Like if I forgot the word for car I would say one of those vehicles that people drive from place to place.\n\nAfter I finish the monologue I transcribe it. Then I take the transcription and revise it using a dictionary, google translate, deepl, and reverso. This step is even more effective if you have someone who is a native speaker to correct the transcript.\n\nThen wait a day and try the same monologue again until you are satisfied with your ability to speak freely about the subject. After that 3-5 days. Switch to a new subject.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nBTW my favorite language game is [taboo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taboo_\\(game\\)) where you try to talk to some and get them to guess the word you are talking about without using that word.

The series is named after its protagonist, an anti-heroic thief, inspired by several previous pulp fiction characters from Italy and other countries. Its stories consist of monthly black-and-white, digest-sized volumes.\"\n\n[Hollywood on the Tiber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood_on_the_Tiber) and all that it spawned.

More were made in Italy then anywhere else. Many are [free to view online](https://www.youtube.com/c/PEPLUMTV/videos). And around a [hundred in Italian](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_ip4tli3pJVBflgIP9zxo9lEd8WIYeOY) completely free and legal. I understand that not everyone is into them. Which is fine by me.\n\nItalian Horror is right up there with British Gothic Horror as far as my favorites go. With [Mario Bava](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mario_Bava) being one of my favorites. He gave us wonderful Peplum as well as horror.  He even gave us \"Black Sabbath\" which the metal band took their name from.  Other favorites are of course Dario Argento and Lucio Fulci. Argento has a [Horror museum and store](http://www.profondorossostore.com/it/content/6-museo-degli-orrori-di-dario-argento) in downtown Rome.\n\nI also happen to love the [Musicarello](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musicarello) genre which are usually musical comedies. One of my favorites is [Urlatori alla sbarra](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHdZ0USxB2U) directed by  Lucio Fulci with Adriano Celentano, Mina, Joe Sentieri, and Chet Baker\n\nThere are also hundreds of Italian euro-crime, euro-spy and [Poliziotteschi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poliziotteschi) films to enjoy. Not my main area of interest but I do enjoy a few.\n\nI guess I should also mention [Westers](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_ip4tli3pJVAPZx92rz-DauaWjptSsaW) including a long running comic series [Tex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tex_Willer)\n\nNot many people know about the long history of [Disney and Italy](https://www.italymagazine.com/featured-story/italian-roots-mickey-mouse), this is a much shortened vesion of the story.

It works well for very stubborn words that don't have obvious connections.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSo imagine the word were \"fattoria\" in Italian which in English means farm. When memorizing words in Italian it is important to learn the gender. So when I learn new words and want to use a mnemonic I use the Fluent Forever gender thing, where masculine is exploding, feminine is burning.

Like the robot had a computer screen over its head where the words ahhhh.... were being typed out in real time. The timer had a banner that said \"Riiiiinnng\" that was slowly being unfurled from it. The robot had a humanoid form with a giant over-sided toe attached to the foot like appendage kinda like one of those giant foam fingers at a football game.

I will write it out so that you or someone else can hopefully help me make sense of it. And it might even help with your dilemma. \n\nWhen I read in English and I encounter a word that I don't know. I know enough of the surrounding words to either be able to deduce what it means in context, or to know if the word is important to know or not. I usually only have to look up 1 to 3 words per month in my NL readings.\n\nAs an example of the first. \"Friendship is certainly the finest balm for the pangs of disappointed love.\" If I did not know what pangs were I feel like I would be able to deduce that it meant something close to pain. Since the sentence is talking about disappointed love.  Also \"pangs\" sounds a little like pain.\n\nFor an example of the second \"But in this his hopes were deluded; for his eyes, dimmed by the vapours of his head, began to subserve his curiosity so ill, that he beheld nothing but a thick dun cloud, which he took for the most direful of omens.\" I have no idea what a \"thick dun cloud\" or even a \"dun\" is. \n\nIt might be a color. It might be a describing its density. It might be describing the mist that blows over a dune. I just have no idea.\n\nBut I instinctively know that I do not have to know what dun means for the sentence to make perfect sense. \n\nWhat I have noticed when I am learning my TL is I have no way of knowing how important a word is to a sentence. Or if I am really understanding it from context. \n\nSo that leads to your question. Would I put \"dun\" on a card if I encountered its equivalent in my TL? Up until the point where I had learned about 1500-2K words in my TL I would have said yes of course. But now I lean toward not.

Take reading material that has a audio recording. Listen to it at full speed while reading. Then read it out loud trying to mach the recordings speed and pronunciation. Start with sentences, then paragraphs, then chapters. My [preferred version of this](https://old.reddit.com/r/languagelearning/comments/s1iez5/my_intensive_rereading_technique_with_a_language/).\n\n**Bi-directional translation**. Read material which is well below ones current level. Translate it into native language. Wait a couple days and take native version and try to write it in the Target Language without the use of any aids. Compare to the original. This gives instant feedback on spelling, grammar, and sentence structure.\n\n**Writing streak subreddits**. Many languages have a place on reddit where you can post a short daily diary or other writing. People often give feedback to help correct the writing. It is customary when doing this to go on to the opposite subreddit and help correct other peoples write streaks in your native language.\n\n**Monologue practice**.  Pick a subject. Talk about it while recording the audio and/or video. No aids such as dictionaries, grammar charts, or translation apps if you are missing a word it is ok to fill with a place holder in native language. At first start with 3 mins, then later 5mins, and then 10mins.  When done transcribe the audio/video into text.   Make any corrections. Put that corrected transcription away. Do the same thing the next day on the same subject without any aids again and repeat the process. Doing the same subject for a few days in a  row until satisfied with the abilities to speak about that subject. Then pick a new subject and start again.\n\n**4-3-2** in a class setting. In this activity, students tell the same story three times to three different partners, but with decreasing time. 4 minutes for the first exchange, 3mins for the 2nd and 2mins for the third.
