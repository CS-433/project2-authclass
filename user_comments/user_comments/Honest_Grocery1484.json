As long as I don't fund it or harm an animal voluntarily, if someone offers me a steak I say no because that steak probably comes from an animal that has been killed to be butchered. But in the theoretical case I find a carcass and something can be saved, I'll butcher it and give the bones a propper burial (even though I'm not religious, but burying something is better than lettting it rot).\n\nSo I draw the line mainly based on my morals because I live by them, they're a guideline. I follow a mostly stoic approach to life (mostly because stoicism without any other philosophy quickly derives into nihilism), the carcass scenario can't be helped, there's nothing I can do other than give that dead animal a proper farewell, but I will never harm a being that's able to feel pain on purpose.
