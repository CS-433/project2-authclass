The culmination of Orpheus\u2019 idealism was him attempting to bring Eurydice back, but he lost grip of his doubt, and Hermes would come and retell the story in the hopes that it would console someone. It could be himself. An overarching theme I noticed is that the past plays a very strong hold on these characters, especially Hades and Persephone. Their entire relationship focuses on their past, and when the reality of Hades\u2019 coldness dawned on Persephone, their relationship strained.
