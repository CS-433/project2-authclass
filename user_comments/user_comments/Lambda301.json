Azerbaijan had an early advantage over the Armenian side in terms of equipment. For instance, Azerbaijan had 436 tanks against Armenia\u2019s 77; 558 vs. 150 infantry fighting vehicles (IFV); 389 vs. 39 armored personnel carriers (APC); 388 pieces of artillery against 160; 63 warplanes against three. Armenia had supremacy only in the number of helicopters: 13 against Azerbaijan\u2019s 8.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Armenians have been preparing the defense of Karabakh for the past 20 years (and they still lost it in 40 days lol)\n\nWonder how long it would have been without the foreign support Azerbaijan received from one of the top 10 strongest countries in the world.", "created_utc": "1638725789.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hnch0ov", "is_submitter": "True", "link_id": "t3_r8utmb", "parent_id": "t1_hncgc1r", "score": "-2", "subreddit": "KarabakhConflict", "subreddit_id": "t5_3dwnu"}, {"author": "Lambda301", "body": ">I think you are mistaken. They never denied the involvement of foreign aid. They specifically said there were no turkish tropps and there were no mercenaries. And in fact, the post above never mentions mercenaries.\n\nI wonder how else the Turkish MIT can be involved. And no matter how they are invloved, the VP specifically said it made a big impact, so any type of involvement they had is significant.\n\n>What a moronic statement. Even if Azeris used mercenaries, how do you infer they don't care enough lol. U.S. used mercenaries in half of their freedom fights, are you suggesting U.S. didn't care about their wars lol? Or any other war in history pretty much.\n\nUsing mercanaries or foreign support is normally a last resort used by nations who do not have the capabilities to win the war by themselves, and Azeris shouldnt have needed that since they had a 3 times bigger army and 4 times bigger military budget then their opponent. Specifically calling for foreign support and mercs is an indication of weakness.\n\n>Defending a land is always easier than attacking a land. It's not a matter of Azerbaijan not being able to take their lands back, its a matter of how many soldiers they sacrifice in the way.\n\nOh yeah? Then if defending a land is so easy why did Azeris loose with 3 times more casualties than Armenians in the first war while defending? \n\n>Right, as if everything Armenians have isn't a direct donation from Russia LOL\n\nKeep telling yourself that. Armenia has paied for every single one of it's weapons it has recieved from Russia and you can clearly see for yourself in a report [here](https://www.evnreport.com/spotlight-karabakh/arms-supplies-to-armenia-and-azerbaijan)(source is SPIRI).
