And while yes hiragana and katakana are phonetic, they are rarely used for full words, hiragana is usually used only for Grammar, and katakana is for onomatopoeia and loan words. kanji is way more difficult to read in Japanese since each character has at least 2 readings, and some have up to 9+ different readings depending on the context. So you can't just say oh this character \u5206 means minute and it's read as fun so when I see it I read it as fun.... No no. 1\u5206 (ippun) one min, 2\u5206 (ni fun) 2 mins, \uff13\u5206 (San bun) 3 minutes. \u5206\u304b\u308b (wakaru) to understand/know. That's just the tip of the iceberg, the hardest thing is that kanji readings are not consistent, meaning everytime you see a new Kanji order, or different hiragana around it you need to look up how it's read in that specific situation, not only do you need to know what the character means without any pronunciation showing, you need to look at the rest of the words around it in order to know which way to read them. It's a complete mess. I think I'm terms of reading/writing Japanese is harder, in terms of speaking/listening Chinese is harder. Yeah Japanese is the fastest spoken language in the world, the pronunciation is quite simple with only a few sounds not in English you have to get used to, the pitch and stress can make you sound weird but most of the time it doesn't change the meaning too much, and you can tell by context. The syntax is backwards so that's weird to get used to, but the grammar is pretty straight forward.

If you want to look at a superficial level I'd say Chinese because it's characters came from there, but that's not easier than Japanese really they're probably about the same level of difficulty. Maybe Korean? Korean grammar at a basic level is similar to Japanese, and some of the same words sound very similar to Japanese. Also the writing system is arguably the easiest script in the world, takes some practice obviously but it's a cake walk compared to Japanese. However I've heard that the pronunciation is kinda tricky and at a higher level the grammar gets more complex. Also I know that there are more levels of polite speach to be aware of. IMHO I'd suggest that if you want to study a foreign language that's similar to Japanese but easier, I'd go for Korean. I personally have never really studied Korean, it seams easier than Japanese, but that doesn't mean it's an easy language, just not as complex as Japanese.

I'm a native English speaker and I've learned several languages to a basic A1/A2 level. And a few others to B2/C1. In my experience when you learn a new language, you don't just learn different words to say the same thing, you learn a whole new mindset along with it. Especially with languages that have different syntax. For example in Japanese it's SOV meaning the verb is at the end of the sentence, here's an example of a Japanese sentence directly translated to English. \u30a2\u30a4\u30b9\u30af\u30ea\u30fc\u30e0\u3092\u98df\u3079\u3066\u3044\u308b\u4eba\u306f\u99c5\u306e\u65b9\u306b\u6b69\u3044\u3066\u3044\u305f\u3002Ice cream eating person train station in the direction of was walking. However English syntax would put it as: The person eating ice cream was walking in the direction of the train station. When you have to form thoughts in different orders it forces you to think in different ways than you're used to. Also there's probably the main point which is levels of politeness in speach. Japanese and Korean have many different levels speach depending on how you want to portray you're respect/authority: You have a basic level of politeness you speak with strangers, you can talk up to a superior/upperclassmen etc, buy raising your politeness, and there's even higher levels when talking to even higher people. You can also talk slightly more casual with your friends and family, or people below you in status either in age or position. And there's different levels of that as well, or you can talk to someone higher than you by talking down to yourself, basically saying I'm putting myself down below your level... etc. When you're forced to think which level of respectfulness to talk to someone in I think it changes your personality a little. For me I m kw when I'm Speaking Japanese I feel more respectful and polite, since it's ingrained into the language. And when I'm speaking Russian I tend to come across as more curt, and slightly cold-hearted, not to say all Russians are cold hearted, but the way the language works it tends to come across more that way. Also I associate vikings when I think scandanavia n so when I'm speaking in Norwegian I feel more like a pirate/viking. Basically I think that certain languages have certain aspects ingrained into the language forcing you to think and react differently than you would when not speaking it.", "created_utc": "1664822961.0", "edited": "False", "id": "iqx1ztv", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_xtzqjb", "parent_id": "t3_xtzqjb", "score": "1", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "Brew-_-", "body": "Bro you look like an Egyptian royal, looking good.", "created_utc": "1664743676.0", "edited": "False", "id": "iqssr68", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_xtbuu6", "parent_id": "t3_xtbuu6", "score": "1", "subreddit": "bald", "subreddit_id": "t5_2sfez"}, {"author": "Brew-_-", "body": "I mean possibly? if you're barely saying a complete sentence then they realize, oh he/she must me a beginner and their trying hard to speak this language, (especially if it's a harder/less studied language) so they complement you, usually it's more of an appreciation for taking your time to learn thier language. So it's more out of admiration than your actual level. But if you speak more than basic words and can have a conversation with them, even if it's breif, they probably actually think you're good. And you can tell you're really good when they don't even react at first, if they just start speaking back in that language without even hesitating then you're really good. Even if their compliments sound more out of respect than your actual level, I still take it as a compliment to boost my ego a little. It really helps out with motivation to keep learning.

Your understanding will always be higher than your speaking, even in your native language.

If you didn't know what rev matching is you're not upset and feel dumb, and also you probably can get a good idea from the context of what it's about. But you don't care about not knowing a certain word. My point is that you might know roughly what rev matching is by context, but on the other hand you can't just pull that word out by yourself in a conversation. It's the same with every language, you might be able to read a novel, but are you really going to be able to say indubitably in a conversation? Heck no. Don't worry about not being able to say everything you understand, just use what you know and get lots of input, and conversation practice and over time your diction will grow. It should be noted that the best way to get better at speaking is to speak, have conversations as much as you can, sound like an idiot by messing up p grammar, don't worry about it, no one in real life is going to pull out a peice of paper and write down every time you make a mistake, just focus on getting your point across and over time you'll get better at it.

Japanese has 3 written scripts, \u3072\u3089\u304c\u306a (hiragana), \u30ab\u30bf\u30ab\u30ca (katakana) and \u6f22\u5b57 (kanji). Before Japanese had a written script, they initially borrowed Kanji from China, kanji literally means China characters, they borrowed the Chinese written script and adopted it to fit their language, that was their first written language. Then later on they created hiragana and katakana which are 100% Japanese made scripts, theres actually a lot of history here but I'll skip it for now. Hiragana and katakana both have every sound in Japanese, meaning you could write any thing you wanted in Japanese with those scripts, however, kanji not only can be read, but also shows a story so to speak, the Kanji characters are made of different parts that show meaning, it's really more like a picture than a written word. The cool thing about kanji is that since they came from China, Chinese people can understand most of them as well. This part is 100% up to you, but generally people like have more kanji as tattoos since they look cooler. But again don't worry about what other people think, tattoos are on your skin, it's all up to you exactly what you want. Here's an example\n\nHere's the first sentence written in hiragana\n\u3069\u3053\u306b\u3044\u307e\u3059\u304b\n\nHere in katakana\n\u30c9\u30b3\u30cb\u30a4\u30de\u30b9\u30ab\n \nAnd here in kanji\n\u4f55\u51e6\u306b\u5c45\u307e\u3059\u304b\n\nUsually most Japanese is written in all three scripts this sentence in particular would most commonly be written in hiragana, however whichever one you prefer is up to you, they all mean the same thing just written in different scripts.", "created_utc": "1661849141.0", "edited": "False", "id": "imd3jfe", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_x1clxf", "parent_id": "t1_imd2fo9", "score": "1", "subreddit": "translator", "subreddit_id": "t5_2ss9z"}, {"author": "Brew-_-", "body": "\u6d41\u66a2\u306e\u4ee3\u308f\u308a\u306b\u30da\u30e9\u30da\u30e9\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u3066\u3082\u6b63\u3057\u3044\u3067\u3059\u304b\uff1f", "created_utc": "1661848096.0", "edited": "False", "id": "imd2d7k", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_x1bogr", "parent_id": "t1_imcw18r", "score": "2", "subreddit": "translator", "subreddit_id": "t5_2ss9z"}, {"author": "Brew-_-", "body": "Also I'm drunk rn not gonna lie, so sorry if I had a typeo.

(Where are you?)\n\n\nI'll break it down for you\n\n\u3069\u3053(where) \u306b(location particle) \u3044\u307e\u3059(to be/exist) \u304b (question particle, think of it as a spoken question mark.)\n\nThe only difference for the second one is the addition of \u3042\u306a\u305f\u306f at the front. \u3042\u306a\u305f(you) \u306f(topic marker)\n\nSo technically the first one just means where exist/be. And the second says you where exist/be. \n\nHere's the tricky part, the first one sounds more natural, here's why. Japanese is a very contextual heavy language, meaning that it heavily depends on the situation. And when you are in conversation once something is already understood, there is no reason to mention the thing specifically, since it's easy to tell from context they just omit it, usually the topic. \n\nAnother thing is that Japanese people almost never say \u3042\u306a\u305f (anata). You'll see it written in books to help clarify occasionally. Also anata can have a romantic connotation, usually wives will refer to their husbands as anata. And girlfriends will call their boyfriends anata. For example is some girl said \u3042\u306a\u305f\u306f\u82b1\u304c\u597d\u304d\u3067\u3059 anata wa hana ga suki desu. Most Japanese people would think she means my boyfriend likes flowers. So basically technically \u3042\u306a\u305f\u306f\u3069\u3053\u3044\u3044\u307e\u3059\u304b means where are you, however Japanese people omit pronouns most of the time, and anata can also have a connotation of husband/boyfriend. So my guess is that native Japanese people would think addibg anata is not natural, but it's correct grammatically, so it's really up to you, it's going to be on your skin forever. Just know that they are both correct grammatically, but personally I feel the first one sounds better and more natural. Also look at other ways of writing it down, for example you could swap out any hiragana for kanji, like this, \u8cb4\u65b9\u306f\u4f55\u51e6\u306b\u5c45\u307e\u3059\u304b\n\nYou. Could add a question mark at the end, but you don't have to, since the \u304b at the end is a verbal question mark it's really your choice how you want to style it, there tonnes of ways to change it up. P.S. I'm not a native Japanese,  an American that has studied Japanese for a while and I'm not quite fluent yet, I'd personally say upper intermediate. Just want to put that out there, take it with a grain of salt it's possible that I'm missing something so I'd wait until you get confirmation from a native just in case, you since it is permanent I would check all my bases if I were you.

Basically load your brain with as much TL input as you can until it hurts. I'm talking listening to podcasts, watch movies, watch YouTube videos, TV series, songs, read books, news articles, online blogs, manga... Etc. The hard part is finding content that is a balance between something that you enjoy and something that is at your level. If you can't understand any of it, then you are wasting your time however if you can understand perfectly then it's too easy for you and you need to move on to something harder/ more complex. I find what helps me the best is finding something that has audio from native speakers and texts to go along with it so you can read the text and listen to the audio, audio books are a great example. And I'll combine that with adding new words that I'm learning into a flash card system preferably spaced repetition, I use Anki. And I just listen to something, then I'll read the text and add words that I don't know that I think would be useful to know. Then I'll study the flashcards and then a few days later listen to the thing again and read it again review flashcards, rinse and repeat. Everyone has their own way of learning, this is what I find to help best for me but depending on your personality type something else might do better. However it's been proven time and time again that input based learning strategies are more efficient than others. One big thing to remember is don't just listen / read something because it is a good level for you, if it is not interesting your motivation will suffer and that's a big no no, you want to make sure that it is interesting enough. My goal is to think would I be reading or listening to this if it was in my native language? If not then it's obviously not interesting enough and it's time to look for something else.

First things first, never. I repeat never accept Walmart orders.. avoid them like the plague. Second you should study your market first, figure out how much you could be making, and for how many miles, which days and times are most profitable, and locations as well. If you hang out near more expensive restaurants usually the pay and tips are better, but sometimes the wait times are too long (done just by working and taking notes. Figure out what restaurants are always slow/behind and avoid them. A good rule of thumb is to only accept orders that are at least $2 per mile. And have a minimum pay you accept, like no orders less than $5 or whatever. This varies depending on your market. Here's what I do when DDing. First I'll go to a busy area and wait, don't waste miles driving around waiting for orders, if I'm not getting anything good I'll move to another hotspot that's good. I only accept orders that are at least $6. But I'm talking like it has to be 1 mile or 2 max. Anything that's 5 miles or has to be at least $2 per mile. I never accept orders that are 10 miles plus unless the payout is really good, and it's a quick drive, like mostly freeway etc. Don't worry about your acceptance rate it doesn't mean s***, the only thing that matters is your customer rating and your completion rating. My acceptance rate hovers around 2% most of the time. You have to know your worth and value worth, for example let's say my worth is $20 an hour. That means I'll only accept orders if it fits around $20 an hour pay. For example let's say I get a $10 order and I can get it done in 30 minutes or less then I'll do it. But if it takes me more than 30 minutes for $10 it's not worth it. Some markets are really profitable meaning you can be making 30 to $40 an hour and some are a lot less meaning you'll have to lower it till like 15 to 20. I've been doing doordash along with other courier jobs over the past couple years, throughout four different states. The lowest I've averaged is like $17 and hour. But that's on a slow day, and a state where minimum wage is $ 7.25. I usually average somewhere around $20-25 an hour on good days I can get up to 40 an hour.
