I like to call it that way since I think about it this way: as you keep immersing your brain automatically gets used to this new linguistic system and just \"builds a copy\" of it which it can relates to whenever you have any contact with the language. Every contact with the language is therefore both filtered through this copy (which itself acts as a filter) to check if there's any similarity. The more similar the piece of language you've encountered is to your preexisting model, the easier you're gonna be able to understand that. When the copy/filter finds something new though which isn't similar to anything you've encountered before, what happens is that your brain just slowly starts adding that new thing to the model, expanding your filter basically. As you keep doing this for enough time your filter/copy of the language will grow more and more until it will reach a point at which it will be able to cover most of what you read/hear. At that point you'll just be able to easily output and speak since you're not trying to speak through conscious knowledge anymore, but you'll be speaking through pulling words and structures directly out of this copy of the language that at this point would be pretty similar to the actual language spoken by native speakers. This at least was my experience with English.

It's still really useful to use an SRS though, for me it's like it creates a mental entry of the word so that when I see that in context I can more easily trigger the actual acquisition process.

That +1 doesn't necessarily have to be a word, rather just a single element which prevent you from full understanding of a given phrase, but obviously quite often it's the actual meaning of words which somehow doesn't allow you to fully understand the phrase. Also learning a bit about grammar and syntax can definitely give you a head start in the very beginning, but I feel like to fully acquire nuances of very particular grammar or syntax future, after a while it is just paramount that one have enough words to be able not to be distracted by the words, so that we can just allow our brain to only focus on decoding grammar and syntax patterns, as we as all those subconscious language processing patterns that native speakers rely on in order to produce their language.\n\nFor example, I've never really spent too much time learning English grammar for example, basically I would just watch content I was interested in and immersion did the job to also allow me to pick up most nuances and features of English, and I felt it wasn't that much of a struggle especially because of the quite large chunk of English vocabulary derived from latin. Once acquired the remaining part of common vocabulary of Germanic origin the +1s started consisting only of peculiarities of the English grammar and syntax. \nWith Portuguese or Spanish it was even easier, being most words and grammar points shared between those languages and my native tongue. With french it was harder because cognates and relations between Italian words and French words are just less transparent because of the hugely different pronunciation and spelling system.\nNow that I'm learning German, despite having checked and continuing checking grammar points whenever I don't understand something on a structural level, I mostly learn words while reading stuff, looking up words or translating sentences I don't understand on Deepl for example whenever I come across one whose syntax somehow throws me off because I'm still not extremely comfortable with it, and it's making me much less eager to look up grammar and syntax rules because knowing the words greatly improved my ability to generally understand the meaning of a given sentence so that my brain just can acquire grammar and syntax on its own in the background through immersion", "created_utc": "1653181372.0", "edited": "1653231138.0", "id": "i9igs3t", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_uukcyh", "parent_id": "t3_uukcyh", "score": "6", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "giovanni_conte", "body": "No I'm probably gonna keep building my roster at this point, also hated the eternals movie lol\n\nThanks you very much for the tips!", "created_utc": "1653163717.0", "edited": "False", "id": "i9hj3xz", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_uuovde", "parent_id": "t1_i9hbeag", "score": "1", "subreddit": "future_fight", "subreddit_id": "t5_3eui5"}, {"author": "giovanni_conte", "body": "IGN: Twelfth Doctor\n\nI'm a returning player (mostly F2P, just get Stark's stash).

One is common to all Tuscan dialects which is the fact that a lot or consonants in intervocalic position get pronounced differently from standard Italian (k sounds are pronounced like a German soft \u03c7, t like English \u03b8, p with some sort of aspiration like \u0278, \u0261 like \u0263, d like \u00f0\u02c8\u02c8, t\u0283 like \u0283, d\u0292 like \u0292, b like \u03b2 and probably some other one).

A few days ago though I\\`m starting to experiment a bit since I remembered about how I got fluent in Brazilian Portuguese through immersion a few months ago, and I\\`m trying to apply a bit more the same things I did at the time also on my current Mandarin Chinese learning (obviously by changing the method and doing extra activities that being Portuguese extremely similar to my native language, I didn\\`t need to do at the time). Basically I started using much more the Migaku 1T sentences auto-exporter, so I don\\`t manually mine. At this point the only practical difference between intensive and free flow immersion is that during intensive immersion I look up every possible unknown word and try to understand as many sentences as I can (manually mining some interesting MT sentence as well), with free flow I just do the same thing I used to do before this change of approach.

Watching shows with subs is a form of reading even though it includes a form of passive listening as well that definitely has an effect on your listening skills in the long run, but at the same time it's probably not as effective as actual reading. In the end, people learn languages also to be able to enjoy media and pop culture, and I have to say that it's quite a pain in the neck to not be able to perfectly understand native media with no subs but not be willing enough to put the time and effort to stop -using subs in order for my listening skills to improve, therefore I think that most people would want to hone their listening skills as they learn the language instead of reaching a really high level and then having to deal with this annoying problem of being able to understand everything you read but not everything you hear.", "created_utc": "1602354644.0", "edited": "False", "id": "g8ckj8x", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_j8nx0h", "parent_id": "t1_g8ch4kc", "score": "2", "subreddit": "MassImmersionApproach", "subreddit_id": "t5_rw8og"}, {"author": "giovanni_conte", "body": "Speaking only from my experience learning english, I spent considerably more time watching english tv shows with subtitles in english and as a result my listening is quite shitty when watching tv shows without them.

Let's start by saying that I'm following the MIA (Mass Immersion Approach).\n\nWe can divide the whole learning process in two separate parts: deliberate studying and actual immersion with target language media (both written and spoken).\n\nFor Mandarin the deliberate studying part for me meant studying around a thousand characters to start getting a feel for the whole character system (and that's easily translatable to Cantonese) through the RTH Recognition (You can download the Anki deck I used from [here](http://www.mediafire.com/file/faiab4flxsrwmc6/Recognition_RTH_%2528Traditional%2529.apkg/file)) . \n\nAfter that I've basically just studied basic grammar through a pretty cool anki deck and through an app called Hello Chinese (but it's a matter of preference, since I don't think there's anything like that for Canto I'd tell you to just go through your textbooks) and I've done a ton of sentence mining (always with Anki). The great thing about Mandarin is that I found this awesome deck called Spoonfed Chinese which is really good because it introduces just a new word for sentence so that you're not overloaded with new knowledge and you're able to generally easily acquire the new knowledge you're presented with. There's nothing like that for Cantonese so I've been making my own cards by using Cantonese with Brittany's beginner videos.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn the actual immersion part I basically just watch dramas in mandarin either with no subs or with subs in mandarin and I'm currently playing the game Ace Attorney which has recently been translated to Mandarin. What I try to do is to always find new sentences with just a new word/grammatical feature I don't know about and make an Anki card about that. Since you're studying Cantonese and you don't have access to something like Spoonfed Chinese you're gonna need to rely on this kinda sentences much more from the very beginning. With Cantonese it's also a bit tricky since you have less chances to practice reading since usually written cantonese is not extremely commonly used in subtitles for example.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAt the end of the day, if I were learning mainly Cantonese instead of Mandarin probably what I would do would be:\n\nLearning characters through the Anki deck I linked you. Reading a Cantonese textbook to start getting a feel for the grammar of the language (speaking of which I recommend you to check [this](https://cantolounge.com/cantonese-grammar-series/) series of written lessons which seems to be pretty decent, and [this](https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cHM6Ly9hbmNob3IuZm0vcy8yMDJlNGZkMC9wb2RjYXN0L3Jzcw?sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjEgP_HmM_rAhUBahoKHdpjAiUQ4aUDegQIARAC) audio course which is aimed to beginner but it's pretty fun anyway). I would start making Anki cards out of Cantonese with Brittany videos which are mainly aimed to beginners and intermediates (the good thing is that she's quite active and she publishes a new video every week). In the meanwhile I would start immersing in the language by watching a lot of cantonese dramas/anime with cantonese dubbing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat I'm personally doing right now though is pretty much making and reviewing Anki cards and watching some videos every once in a while. I'm not focusing much on grammar since quite a lot of the grammar is pretty similar between Mandarin and Cantonese, and I'm not focusing much on immersion because obviously my main target language is Mandarin right now. I'd actually prefer to focus first on Cantonese but since I'll have to study Mandarin in college and there are many more resources for Mandarin I'm currently working on that, also because I think that's gonna help me learn Cantonese much faster in the future (which is something that quite a bit of people seem to do).", "created_utc": "1599487431.0", "edited": "False", "id": "g4byayp", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_io6gnv", "parent_id": "t3_io6gnv", "score": "3", "subreddit": "Cantonese", "subreddit_id": "t5_2wxkd"}, {"author": "giovanni_conte", "body": "I study Chinese and those look like completely normal ways those character would end up looking like if you wrote them quickly.", "created_utc": "1599461264.0", "edited": "False", "id": "g4b5dqo", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_io2jf4", "parent_id": "t3_io2jf4", "score": "4", "subreddit": "MassImmersionApproach", "subreddit_id": "t5_rw8og"}, {"author": "giovanni_conte", "body": "Everything's a supplement unless you don't put the language skills you're acquiring at work somehow.

Then you just practice it for half an hour each. Always practice with a metronome.\nWith exercises from books or from other online sources set milestones like 60, 120, 240 bpm etc\nand practice every group of exercises until you reach all the milestones: practice the first till you reach 60 bpm, then go with the second till 60 and so on until the last one, and then you go back to the first one and do the same until you reach 120 bpm. After 240 you could go to the next group of exercises for the same technique or stop and start with a new technique and get back at practicing an old one you think you need to work on.\nWith pieces and songs, just divide the piece/song into more chunks (4 bar chunks maybe) and practice every chunks singularly until you get to the original tempo of the song. I'd recommend to practice the first chunk, then the second chunk, then the first 2 together, then the third and then all of them together and so on. \n\nIf you don't know how to practice effectively with a metronome, I'd say to start with a slow tempo: let's say 10 bpm for pieces/exercises with a lot of 16th notes, 15 bpm if there are a few 16th notes, 20 bpm if there are lots of 8th notes, 30 if there are a few 8th notes and so on. You practice the exercise or the chunk until you can perform it a given number of times with no mistakes according to the length and tempo. (I have a sort of list of number of repetitions I do according to tempo and length, if you need it).\n\nAnd basically that's it. If you don't have enough time but you have a ton of songs to learn, you could also just practice them, which is something I'd recommend to do once you got to a point in which you have decent understanding of the instrument and decent technique. I'd recommend to always learn proper technique and music theory before doing this since it's probably gonna save you a ton of time in the long run. Obviously you'll have to choose pieces and songs that you can play and that are not particularly hard for you current level, but you shouldn't always pick songs that are too easy either. You should always try to challenge yourself if you really wanna improve, and practicing also exercises and isolated technique is a great way to keep improving regularly. Personally though, I'm not doing that right now since I'm focusing on other instruments.\n\n\nPs for multi-instrumentalists:\nI have 3 \"practice slots\" that I alternate. I can fill these slots with either a session of practice for a single instrument with exercises, pieces etc or with a song for any instrument. Right now I have a slot in which I learn a song (most of them right now are guitar and bass parts) and the other two in which I practice drums and piano (with 4 topics each).", "created_utc": "1566409916.0", "edited": "False", "id": "exlbqo1", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_ctfpuq", "parent_id": "t3_ctfpuq", "score": "2", "subreddit": "Bass", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qpc3"}, {"author": "giovanni_conte", "body": "I'm interested, here's my IGN: Twelfth Doctor", "created_utc": "1566372148.0", "edited": "False", "id": "exk47s1", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_csqnmg", "parent_id": "t1_exgje6e", "score": "1", "subreddit": "future_fight", "subreddit_id": "t5_3eui5"}, {"author": "giovanni_conte", "body": "Not yet, probably gonna get one in a few months though, since lots of people say it's the best beginner budget-friendly kit you can find", "created_utc": "1566327677.0", "edited": "False", "id": "exig7xh", "is_submitter": "True", "link_id": "t3_cjsfgq", "parent_id": "t1_exib3el", "score": "2", "subreddit": "drums", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qie5"}, {"author": "giovanni_conte", "body": "In a couple of days, I'm gonna T2 Storm, Fantomex and Domino, and after that I'm gonna finish the FF Epic Quest, which is my last Epic Quest btw.

For exercises from books I usually stay on the same chapter for a while, for example, on Stick Control we have about 70 exercises in the first single beat chapter. What I'm doing is basically practicing every exercise starting at 20 bpm, practicing until I can play that exercise 3 times in a row (until 30 bpm) and 5 times in a row (until 60) without mistakes and then raising the tempo of 5 bpm every time I can play , until I reach 60 bpm (you could think it's a really slow tempo, and well, it is, but I like to start as slow as possible). Once I'll finish to do this I'm gonna start again, doing the same until I get to 120 bpm (and repeating every exercise 10 times without a mistake before raising the tempo), and then again until I get to 240 bpm (repeating every exercise 20 times), and from there I'm probably gonna go to the next chapter. If you're gonna use this method, remember that it could be hard to get the beat and feel the rhythm at really slow tempos, so you could use metronome that let you subdivide every beat in 2/3/4 etc.\n\nSince it could be kinda boring and frustrating to stay on the same exercises for a long time, I usually always work on different kind of material at the same time.

It'd make sense to first focus on the Mr. Fantastic epic quest, but since it's kinda hard to finish that if you don't have a good source of M'Kraan crystals and phoenix feathers, I'd say to first finish the Wolverine quest since you already have all of the characters you'd need to finish that at 5/6 stars, and as soon as you finish it you're gonna be able to farm 40-50 M'kraan crystals and 100 phoenix feather per day.

You could also build Captain Marvel and get her Endgame uniform since you're gonna need her for ABX too and she's pretty good for WBU too. Since you don't have any Deluxe Pack but you already have pretty decent uniforms (and some of them are really great like IW Bucky or DS ShaRog) I'd say you could get the Captain Marvel's uni and then save enough crystals to get at least the F4 pack (since Invisible Woman is a pretty great character and you're also gonna get pretty good rewards from her stage and, as soon as you finish the Epic Quest, basically a quarter of the crystals refunded).
