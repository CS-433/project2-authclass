Not only will they be watching your general logic, but such a thing also shows your understanding of what to use in the right conditions. For the given example simply using a nested for loop and an array of chars to compare each letter may prove to be the quickest to implement and using Diagnostics will confirm it ran the quickest with small words. But using an anagram of over 100 letters shows that using Lists of chars to remove the already verified letters doesn't experience any reduced performance while the original function got worse and worse with every additional 100 characters added to the anagrams.\n\nTo summarize: Unity is great for learning and practicing but it won't give you the necessary skills in C# to succeed in all jobs.

While you do need a starting point you must also be conscious to not fall into the tutorial trap. \n\nMy advice to you would be to look at your skills:\n\nDo you struggle with programming without instructions? Then walk away from games for a bit and get to grips with the basics of C# and OOP principles. Once you understand a bit then try again and apply what you've learnt.\n\nYou already code well? Alright then Google your specific problems and try some of people's answers. As an example I primarily build FPS or AR games. I wanted to take a break and make a mobile third person game. I had never dealt with camera following and smoothing before. I followed a Unity guide which suggested that camera movement should be handled in LateUpdate() but the movement was still very jumpy, I went through some forums and one user suggested to disregard Unity's advice and put the function in FixedUpdate(), that instantly fixed my issue. \n\nThe point is: development is cycle of trying and testing. No amount of tutorials are going to teach you every small trick. More so they will take your money and not give you much in return, especially when you notice that most game dev tutorials are usually pre-made scripts/ assets as you've experienced or them just reusing Unity's own documentation.\n\nYou need to learn to be comfortable with ambiguity and venturing out on your own. Perhaps it would serve you better to sign up for a game jam or at least find people online to collaborate with/learn with by building games together. You can immediately ask why something is being done a certain way instead of hearing the generic \"Import this package and press install, we won't talk about how it works in this course\".\n\nThe failures, the unpolished broken mechanics of your early projects are always disheartening, but they are also your guides, to see where you're going wrong and find a way around them.

The franchise Walter is also pretty good for food. Any restaurant in Skadarlija will be great and the atmosphere is fantastic. Also get to question mark for coffee and rakija.\n\nBars - My go to is always the Black Turtle chain of bars. Their craft beer is excellent. There is one near Kalemegdan and one (it's called Zorna I think) near the main tourist Boulevard. If you can go to a splav that will also be great, Corso is a fantastic splav at Ada for getting drinks.\n\nGeneral things to do - Museums everywhere. Tesla museum is one of the best as well as the Air museum at the airport. Of course there's nothing better than to just relax in the park at Kalemegdan, sit on a wall and watch the rivers and the skyline of New Belgrade.\n\nYou should also go for a walk up the Danube to Zemun and see Gardos tower. Along the way you'll pass Hotel Yugoslavia most likely resulting in you singing a terrible rendition of 'Hotel California', such a lovely place really. You can go walking around/cycling at Ada. On the history side: Tito's house of flowers is really a must see.

Get a list of the most common 1000 or so Italian words and start learning them in context through simple sentences. Using the Anki mobile or PC app is perfect for this.\n2. Try to get hold of children's books in the language if TV shows are a bit too fast. Movies are great but if it's a new movie it's far less efficient. TV shows are better because of repetitive phrases, catchphrases etc.\n3. Italian grammar isn't anywhere near the brain-melting pains that are the slavic languages but don't stress too much about the grammar at first. I am a major grammar-nazi and as a result, my Serbian grammar is super-advanced at my level...but I can't hold a conversation because my vocabulary is so low. (Basically a professional Serbian tourist at this point and that it as far as it feels I'll get).\n4.
