You also then have to consider the votes they DIDN\u2019T get \u2018due to politics\u2019 so it\u2019s all very complicated and not worth your time.\n\nJust be happy for them.\n\nFor goodness sake why are so many people bitter over this? I mean do you actually wish for their country to die? I seriously can\u2019t imagine or fathom a reason why some people are so aggressive in response to their win unless they actually want to see them wiped out.\n\nAnd I don\u2019t meant that by you having that political view (it would be extremely bizarre), I just truly don\u2019t understand why people are reacting this way instead of just celebrating the team\u2019s achievements and are making the win bitter for the sake of \u2018politics\u2019.\n\nIt\u2019s ridiculous. Do you ask for a recount every time someone with a disability wins something? What about a person of colour? I\u2019m sure religion plays a big part in this too- and how about views on sexuality? Did you ask for a recount of when Austria won? Pretty sure you could come up with some stupid \u2018politics\u2019 argument there too.\n\nThey\u2019re talented people doing their best and within two years you\u2019ll have forgotten who won (because someone else will be hosting lol).\n\nIt\u2019s so bizarre seeing all these people who don\u2019t understand the history of Eurovision and \u2018politics\u2019 (or even how it works in some cases) get in an uproar just because it was so prolific this year (along with the genuine votes).\n\nIf you\u2019re not one of those people that\u2019s hilarious but I suspect you are (or at least you just watched this year/some of the songs from the competition and make your own judgement based on your own politics rather than the actual music).\n\nRip that essay but tbh I feel like o need to say all my views of this in one go (tho that\u2019s impossible) because I\u2019m tired of repeating myself and explaining these thin has to the same people who just see \u2018Ukraine\u2019 and think \u2018war\u2019 and not Kalush Orchestra (at least in this context).\n\nThe amount of people blinded by their views is extremely interesting but, again, seriously undermines the actual talent.\n\nThe song was a banger. That\u2019s it. You can\u2019t tell me it wouldn\u2019t have won otherwise because then you\u2019ve got to nitpick every single past winner and that\u2019s a can of worms I\u2019m sure no one wants to sift through (though feel free to go through each winner and give me an instance where \u2018politics\u2019 played no role at all).\n\nNot gonna read back because f that so rip any autocorrect/mistakes/weird worded things because I\u2019m the Queen of both trash and gibberish lol\n\nHope you have a lovely day and stay safe during these hard times x\n\nETA: Rip but forgot the whole point of your comment and the \u201ccorrectly\u201d I was meant to meme on because there is no \u201ccorrrect\u201d way to vote- just go for whoever you feel like did best :)", "created_utc": "1652606444.0", "edited": "False", "id": "i8oe96g", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_upsliw", "parent_id": "t1_i8oe1bh", "score": "1", "subreddit": "CasualUK", "subreddit_id": "t5_3j2jr"}, {"author": "GalleonsGrave", "body": "DJ khaled", "created_utc": "1652606240.0", "edited": "False", "id": "i8oe0j0", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_upsliw", "parent_id": "t1_i8odz3w", "score": "1", "subreddit": "CasualUK", "subreddit_id": "t5_3j2jr"}, {"author": "GalleonsGrave", "body": "\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "created_utc": "1652606155.0", "edited": "False", "id": "i8odx38", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_upsliw", "parent_id": "t1_i8odtnf", "score": "1", "subreddit": "CasualUK", "subreddit_id": "t5_3j2jr"}, {"author": "GalleonsGrave", "body": "Why would I give a \u2018decent counter\u2019 to an essay?

Sorry. I'm just going to reply to what I do.\n\n> I asked if simply showing religion exceeds placebo would be enough to change your beliefs.\n\nIf by exceeds placebo you mean that it actually has a real, altering affect on you and isn't just in your head, then yes.\n\n> because as long as you have a justified belief, I'm happy for you.\n\nI don't know if I do. What I think is what I think. And what I think I'm uncertain about. So is it justified?\n\n> What are your reasons to believe a naturalistic, deterministic, nihilistic view? \n\nBecause if everything is cause and effect in this universe, then we can't be anything other than predetermined flesh robots that have the illusion of 'choices'. Animals act in such a way that helps them survive. We're no different. Some people avoid their problems because they see danger in them and they think that the best way to deal with that danger is to avoid it, whereas others tackle them head on. I didn't choose to think existence is a pointless struggle, I just do. Our purpose is to fuck and die, just like every other animal on this planet.\n\n> Assuming \"there is a God\" is true, then now you believe a true thing.\n\nWe don't know if God is true. \n\n> That seems inherently valuable, does it not?\n\nNot really. Like I said, the answer to the existence of God is pointless. I would like to know what the other biggest unidentified sea creature looks like. The answer is meaningless to me, but it would be cool to know.\n\n> Or are you just looking for the happy lie that will get you through the rest of your life? \n\nNot entirely sure what you mean.\n\n> It may surprise you, but none of those are requirements for theism.\n\nI know, I just assumed you were either one of those two since they are the most common, sorry.\n\n> That said, if Christianity or Islam WERE the truth, would you want to know? Or would you rather believe a falsehood?\n\nI would 100% like to know. These 80 years left of my life could be put to some actual meaningful use. I wouldn't like the majority of rules laid out for me by either, but I would just tough it out. It's worth it for an eternity in heaven, right? However like I said, me knowing whether Islam is correct, for example, would defeat the point of religion anyway.\n\n> Do you believe that Mohammed being a schizophrenic is proof that no God could possibly exist? Is Mohammed being sane the only way you would believe nihilism wasn't true?\n\nIt's just an example for my opinions against the likes of Christianity or Islam.

There's the implication of falsehood in that. I was bringing up that people reject naturalism (the rejection of which necessitates a supernatural), and wondered how your opinion that religion is a placebo might hold more or less strength than that opposite opinion.\n\nI don't think either holds more strength than the other because both arguments don't really bring anything convincing to the table apart from the statements themselves. They're both just baseless beliefs in my opinion because we literally don't have a base. There's no God-ometer. You might say I'm wrong there because of all the people who have 'felt God' in some way or form, but again, we don't \\*really\\* know. That's why they are beliefs.\n\n>Then, I asked whether proof that religion had more effect than a placebo would be proof of some validity to religion for you.\n\n100%. If you can show me that God is really the one helping you when you are theistic, then that definitely would be. But having proof of God would defeat the biggest part of basically all major religions, in that your faith in God is a test.\n\n>Finally, I saw your reasoning why you felt religion's effect was a placebo. I challenged you with the fairly popular worldview that bad-faith prayers get no responses. What about the world is inconsistent with such a stance? What is it that makes your \"placebo\" belief more likely or justified to you as for why religious people gain more happiness/answers from prayer than you do?\n\nThe reason why I think that it is a placebo is purely because of my naturalistic, free-will-lacking, nihilistic views of existence. I think the idea of whether God does or does not exists is a meaningless question in the end and that if a 'God' does exist, then the only part it has played in the universe was the creation of it.
