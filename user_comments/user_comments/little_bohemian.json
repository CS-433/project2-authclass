I often build replicas of houses and apartments from my real life, but when I'm doing a \"fantasy\" home, I tend to follow American floor plans sometimes, so it's a mix for me. Some things I often include:\n\n\\- fences around lots, yes, unfenced properties are pretty strange to me. Sometimes I leave the front yard open. Lot boundaries in the Sims are weirdly far apart from each other, but I think that's even compared to US suburbs? More of a gameplay thing I guess.\n\n\\- I almost always include an entryway or \"mudroom\" in my builds, we don't have front doors leading directly to the living room. I also don't miss garages so much since many older houses don't have them, or have a detached garage on the lot or even elsewhere (community garage rows - I think that's an eastern Europe thing).\n\n\\- paint/stucco on exterior walls instead of siding or visible brick. Interior walls are just plain white 90% of the time, no crown molding and such.\n\n\\- having more than 1 bathroom per floor seems like overkill luxury to me, lol.\n\n\\- my dorms and student apartments usually don't have any communal areas other than the kitchen. Students are poor, so they typically try to get the most use ouf of a rented apartment including using the living room as another bedroom. Sharing bedrooms is also common here, but I prefer to build single rooms or a mix of single and shared in the dorms. I was always the \"spoilt\" student with a single room and my Sim students don't need to suffer more than that, lol.\n\n There are definitely things missing that would make building stuff I know from real life easier for me, like:\n\n\\- under-the-counter washing machines and indoor clothes drying racks. Most people here have their washing machines in the bathroom, but I've lived in several places where it was under the kitchen counter, and it totally irks me how the Laundry Day machine is exactly as tall as a counter but doesn't go under it.\n\n\\- build-in fridges and dishwashers that blend in with counters, and trash bins hidden under the sink.\n\n\\- white lace curtains with old-fashioned patterns (are there any in Cottage Living? I was kinda hoping for them)\n\n\\- modern radiators and \"German-style\" windows; more wardrobes rather than built-in closets\n\n\\- attics!! One of my biggest wishes for a future Sims game is to have an easy way to build livable attics. It seems like so much wasted space to me. Having an option to build thicker walls would be awesome. And walk-out basements on sloped ground, OMG. There's only so much I can do with houses on flat concrete.\n\n\\- obviously more apartment buildings, and MIXED USE lots! I basically can't build a \"realistic\" looking town centre unless I make empty shells of residential floors above the shops, bars, etc.\n\nI also noticed that many builders put only a bed and a dresser in kids' bedroom, no desks, is that an American thing or a Sims thing?

I (28F) had very strong sub/bottom desires since I was very young, anxiously waited until I moved out for college so I could start going to every single kink event in the city and meet tons of people from the scene, etc., but never had much desire to try switching. Then I started slowly exploring the Top side because of my switch long-term partner and found out that I actually enjoy it quite a bit, especially the anal play stuff. I still feel like a total beginner at it and it's hard for me to feel truly confident while Topping. I really just try to not put too much pressure on myself, as long as we both enjoy ourselves and give constructive feedback between scenes, it's always fun.\n\nHow you label your roles or orientation or anything else is absolutely up to you, I wouldn't really worry about that at all TBH! It sounds like his orientation could be evolving or be fluid in some way, and I think it's really awesome that you're supportive to him. So many people feel like they have to hide things like crossdressing and bi/pan-curiosity from their partners. Ultimately, his identity is for him to figure out, you can only be there to reassure him that it doesn't bother you. I mostly try to find labels to make it easier when I'm looking for new partners or talking to ppl online, but with my life partner we just kinda go with whatever we feel like, describe scenarios to each other or send inspo pics etc. instead of labelling our roles.\n\nSo, regarding butt stuff... I think my advice would be the same as pretty much everyone's: go slow, use way more lube than you think you need, listen to his feedback and let him kind of navigate you/\"top from the bottom\" at the beginning. The prostate is pretty easy to find IMO (with the \"come hither\" motion towards his taint with your index/middle finger around 4-5 cm in), but it varies in sensitivity, some guys prefer a lighter touch while others need really firm pressure on that spot, such as with a steel or glass toy if your hand starts getting too tired ;) If he's played with his ass alone, he can probably tell you pretty well what he needs to get to those coveted P-spot orgasms.\n\nPegging feels amazing to me mentally TBH, even without any stimulation for my bits, it's like the most intimate act we do. However, you definitely need to go slow and work up in dildo size and range of motions. Get a good adjustable harness with interchangeable O-rings.

The stuff in it is decent, I use the workout clothes, and I quite like the modern stuff like chairs and the sink. Although I don't use it quite as much as I first thought, to be honest, I wish some of it like the bathtub came in better colors. The reskinned workout machines are totally interchangeable with the Spa Day ones to me.\n\nBowling - now that we have more mid-century furniture in DHD and Get Famous, this is pretty meh. Bowling itself is basically one object with some animations, I rarely ever use it. Plus a lot of the decorations are bowling-themed, so they don't fit in a \"regular\" house like I usually build.\n\nBackyard - I personally quite like this one because of the bird feeder and chimes, they make for a nice atmosphere. I can't say I've used the slippy slides in my houses, but I put them on public pool lots. Aesthetically it's kinda average, I do like the long bob ombre hair which I think is from this pack.\n\nCool kitchen - another one that becomes kind of underwhelming after DHD, since we finally got modern kitchen sets. I basically liked it for the only really modern looking stove in the game. There's also nice kitchen clutter, but the cabinets themselves look kinda weird with all the frosted glass imo. Ice cream is pretty annoying, I don't use it other than serving it in restaurants.\n\nMFPS - eh, is not actually all that bad, but I still waited for a sale. I use the blinds kind of a lot, and even some of the furniture. Having a small pet is nice as just another activity for kids, and I also like having it for the reskinned CC versions with different pets from Kalino.

Sometimes from institutions like universities, but it's not universal by far. For example, if we want to say \"student\" in a more inclusive way than the standard generic masculine - we can use both forms spelled out (*studentky a studenti*), which gets repetitive in longer texts, use a slash (*student/ka*), alternate between both forms in each sentence, or with a few select words, find a neuter ending that makes it passable as either grammatical gender (*studuj\u00edc\u00ed* \\- \"studying\" instead of student).

In the 1990s, many people were against using feminine forms for jobs previously held by almost 100% men, such as minister (f. *ministryn\u011b*). Some women felt like putting emphasis on their gender like that was unnecessary and demeaning and/or that the words just sounded awful. Eventually it caught on and nobody would even think of calling a woman *ministr* nowadays.\n\nOn a bit of a different topic, I also know a few non-binary people who try to alternate between grammatical genders or use the ending *-e* (instead of *-a* which is feminine) for themselves, which is very niche so far, but we'll see what happens in the future.

It was a big political issue and very unpopular with most voters. So they came to an agreement in which the state financed all affected churches (mostly the Catholic church ofc) from taxes, directly paying their salaries instead of the income they could have had from property. A plan to return their stuff was finally passed in 2013 (IIRC), but because a lot of it had been destroyed or depreciated, we are also still paying them money.

We have a robust system of school cafeterias at all levels of public schooling inhereted from Communist times, and they pretty much still follow nutriton guidelines and recipes from the 1970s. Efforts to update the menus have been slow and cumbersome, even though people started realizing that traditional Czech food isn't very healthy at all. I personally opted out in 4th grade, but then I started going again on some days in high school because my HS was in the middle of nowhere with few opportunities to go out during lunch break and buy something better. Preschool kids also get mid-morning and afternoon snacks/sandwiches, in elementary and high schools it's just lunch.\n\nFood: There's a lot of dumplings, potatoes, heavy sauces, red meat, processed mixes used as shortcuts and too little fresh produce in most cafeterias. Typical lunch consists of soup (Czechs eat soup instead of appetizers 99% of the time; typical ones are something like beef or chicken broth with noodles, lentil soup with bacon, potato and mushroom, or cream soup with dill), a main dish of meat and carbs, a \"dessert\" of an apple/tangerine/banana or yogurt or sometimes a small piece of cake, and drinks like sweetened tea and hot cocoa. [These](https://www.mendelova.cz/fotogalerie/2011-2012/fotky-obedu/obedy-ve-skolni-jidelne.518) are some pretty representative pics, IMO. There are minimum requirements for serving fish and legume-based dishes a few times a month, and most kids hate those when they're not used to eating them from home. The most popular main is always something sweet, which you may get once or twice a month (fruit dumplings, rice pudding etc.). Most cafeterias offer 2 or 3 main dishes every day, and if it's 3 then one of them will usually be vegetarian, but otherwise they don't have to cater to any dietary restrictions.\n\nCosts: Parents who sign their kids up for lunches have to pay monthly in advance, and they pay for the price of ingredients, while government subsidies cover energy and labor costs. It comes out to each side paying around 1/2 of the 2-3\u20ac total price (it varies by area and age group). I'm not sure if we even have fully subsidized lunches for any kids, maybe under the poverty line, but there have been controversies around such proposals. Many school cafeterias also serve local seniors and other people who want in such cheap and simple meals (my grandma gets school lunches delivered to her assisted living home), that's basically their side business (cafeterias are technically independent companies associated with a school). They can also profit from selling non-subsidized snacks during morning breaks, but a few years ago the \"Snack Law\" started limiting unhealthy foods there, so it's not like back in my day when we used to buy chips, sodas and fried cheese sandwiches at the school buffet.
