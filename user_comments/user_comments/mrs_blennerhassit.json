One is the inherit meaningful properties of the word (e.g. \"man\", \"woman\"), but the majority come from vestigal rules on how words of certain forms follow certain grammatical rules.\n\nFrench inherits its gender system in the main from Latin, and Latin nouns ending in -us, or -a, or -um had regular changes in their endings when they were used specific functions, like the actor in relation to a verb, or the receiver in relation to that verb, plus others. French has lost the distinctions on the verbs themselves for these functions, but still has different words to separate the different groups when they are referred to.\n\nWhile there were five groups in Latin, French only distinguishes two now, those with \"la\" and those with \"le\". Dutch has masculine and feminine nouns referred to as \"de\", and neuter nouns as \"het\". English used to have a range of words for \"the\" with the same function, but has since gone one step further and conflated everything to \"the\".\n\nAs for new words, they are either assigned by association with existing words, e.g. everything ending in -ion in French is feminine by default, or completely new words or borrowings are assigned this by consensus.

I think I am more on the obedient end of the spectrum, so you may see others saying it's ok in some circumstances to do some of the things I don't (e.g. red light jump). Hopefully this addresses some of the things you ask.\n\nMy approach to cyclings is in three parts: be visible, be predictable, and be considerate.\n\n1. Visible means (a) wear a high-viz jacket day and night over what you're wearing and have a forward white light and rear red light if the light is at all low, and (b) be aware of your position in the road and make sure that cars can see you. Don't attempt any overtake manoeuvres without knowing that you've been seen, as people can do some unexpected things.\n\n2. Predictable means obeying the laws of the road first and foremost. Our whole driving system is remarkably safe in the grand scheme of things given the amount of vehicles on our roads and the speeds they're going at, and that only works on the assumption that there are systems and we follow the rules. Don't jump red lights. Don't jump on and off the pavement; other road users can't tell what you're doing, even if you think it's clear. Where there is a forward reservation for cyclists, use it. Always signal with your arms, consider even pointing forward at crossroads for complete clarity. If you feel there isn't room for someone in a car to overtake you, occupy the middle of the road, otherwise you might be perceived as inviting them to overtake. Taking the middle of the lane gives a clear message. Basically do what you're doing clearly. I stop to let people cross at zebras when they're on the other side - they have right of way.\n\n3. Considerate means realising that while cycling is great and beneficial, it's a relatively new thing in the amounts that it is happening now, and our roads have been developed over the last 150 years to suit cars primarily - and still will. Things will change and cycling will become easier - borough councils are all for this - but it will take time and at the same time motor traffic is still necessary for our economy.\n\nYou'll have altercations, that's a part of being on the road. I cycle, I drive and I ride a motorbike, and have had people say all sorts of things to me on my many miles. Sometimes I make mistakes, somethings others make mistakes that affect me. My approach is to have a mind like a goldfish: someone might piss me off, but five seconds later I have to have forgotten about it otherwise it'll build up and affect me personally.\n\nGood cycling to you, from the sounds of the question you're doing fine!", "created_utc": "1408483042.0", "edited": "1408483274.0", "id": "cjuxqjw", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_2e0pxw", "parent_id": "t3_2e0pxw", "score": "7", "subreddit": "londoncycling", "subreddit_id": "t5_2wcdj"}, {"author": "mrs_blennerhassit", "body": "my new wallpaper. thanks bud!", "created_utc": "1408449943.0", "edited": "False", "id": "cjugwoy", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_2dxp3v", "parent_id": "t3_2dxp3v", "score": "1", "subreddit": "pics", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh0u"}, {"author": "mrs_blennerhassit", "body": "A nice, friendly alternative nearby is Luna Cycles in Kentish Town West.

It became rapidly clear that she was very unstable, her mood swings were very severe, because of some frankly very bad things that had happened to her and were still happening (in brief, being raped and having deaths in family both sudden and slow before age of 21). It wasn't the fact that she was angry about this stuff rather that she took it out on me in a deeply personal and hurtful way. I broke up with her for these and other reasons.\n\nTwo years later, after going on a year abroad to the south of France and coming back to the UK she turned up again for a party at a friend's house and was apparently back for a few months again. There was a little tension as things had ended badly between us but time had passed and we ended up having a heart-to-heart, then one thing led to another. I hadn't had any sort of relationship in the intervening time so it kinda felt right.\n\nI didn't want to get back with her initially so she offered a 'casual' relationship. The young fella in me said 'go for it, why not', managing to silence the perhaps wiser side of me, and I said yes. Three months later, I found myself in a full-on relationship, I was introducing her to my family, we were giving birthday presents more than normal friends, and all the time (well, most of the time) I was thinking I should get out. She was essentially no more emotionally resilient, and flipped out at the slightest thing like a ten-year-old. Again, not her fault but difficult to put up with and what was I getting out of it? It lasted eighteen months and I look back on it with very mixed feelings, as there were some highs but a lot of lows.\n\nAdvice from this rather confused individual? It may be a good idea to get back with someone after you've split up with them but be sure that they have grown as a person before you do because the relationships you have with people, SOs and friends and family alike, are very difficult to modify, and you will find yourself playing the same role as you did before because of those old impressions you had that you might see differently in a person you've only just met.", "created_utc": "1357686587.0", "edited": "False", "id": "c7th31a", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_167494", "parent_id": "t3_167494", "score": "2", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i"}, {"author": "mrs_blennerhassit", "body": "not a problem i've ever encountered, my man", "created_utc": "1357499020.0", "edited": "False", "id": "c7s4a7p", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_161z3e", "parent_id": "t1_c7s0mpl", "score": "1", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i"}, {"author": "mrs_blennerhassit", "body": "You didn't really need to tl/dr that; it was a perfectly manageable size.", "created_utc": "1351549446.0", "edited": "False", "id": "c6tke40", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_129wri", "parent_id": "t1_c6tgw4o", "score": "6", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i"}, {"author": "mrs_blennerhassit", "body": "Downvoted for being a spelling nazi", "created_utc": "1351509777.0", "edited": "False", "id": "c6tb1g8", "is_submitter": "True", "link_id": "t3_127rwu", "parent_id": "t1_c6swyx0", "score": "-1", "subreddit": "AdviceAnimals", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s7tt"}, {"author": "mrs_blennerhassit", "body": "english. didn't realise there was any variation to it!", "created_utc": "1351498054.0", "edited": "False", "id": "c6t9z66", "is_submitter": "True", "link_id": "t3_127rwu", "parent_id": "t1_c6t5for", "score": "1", "subreddit": "AdviceAnimals", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s7tt"}, {"author": "mrs_blennerhassit", "body": "bazzle", "created_utc": "1351466059.0", "edited": "False", "id": "c6t39wu", "is_submitter": "True", "link_id": "t3_127rwu", "parent_id": "t1_c6szq6y", "score": "-6", "subreddit": "AdviceAnimals", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s7tt"}, {"author": "mrs_blennerhassit", "body": "orry-gah-noe", "created_utc": "1351466038.0", "edited": "False", "id": "c6t39qb", "is_submitter": "True", "link_id": "t3_127rwu", "parent_id": "t1_c6szq6y", "score": "-7", "subreddit": "AdviceAnimals", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s7tt"}, {"author": "mrs_blennerhassit", "body": "we do pronounce it like that in england", "created_utc": "1351465522.0", "edited": "False", "id": "c6t35cw", "is_submitter": "True", "link_id": "t3_127rwu", "parent_id": "t1_c6szq6y", "score": "-4", "subreddit": "AdviceAnimals", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s7tt"}, {"author": "mrs_blennerhassit", "body": "I learned German starting at the age of 20 and it was awesome.

The adjective endings have a logic to them that sinks in over time (basically you only indicate the case of the noun on one element and there's basic forms that come before or after), the plurals of nouns may seem random but there's some very common trends that apply to 90% of nouns (add -e. if already ends in -e, add n. if already adds in -en, do nothing). and the word order is a joy to behold, because once everything's locked in place, you already know what's interacting with what and you've just got to get your vocabulary sorted - which was the difficult part for me.", "created_utc": "1349200334.0", "edited": "False", "id": "c6gk20c", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_10pl18", "parent_id": "t1_c6fivmd", "score": "2", "subreddit": "IWantToLearn", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjo5"}, {"author": "mrs_blennerhassit", "body": "\"You're twice as thick as a dead tree.\"\nPoetry!
