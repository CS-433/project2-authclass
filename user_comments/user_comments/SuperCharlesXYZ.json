I tried setting up a bunch of enemies with high hp or NPC\u2019s like elves who are immune to sleep, but sooner or later they will still default to sleep, the issue isn\u2019t even that it\u2019s overpowered or gets past my challenges, it\u2019s that they will keep casting it and then afterwards not have as much fun when their spell slots are fun. They are a relatively new player, so I don\u2019t want to tell them how to play exactly as that takes the fun out of it.
