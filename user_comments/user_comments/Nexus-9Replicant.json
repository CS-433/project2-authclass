The rest is a combination of Russian (15%), Gagauz (3%), etc. This is not including the Russian occupied territory of Transnistria, which is about 1/3 Moldovan/Romanian, 1/3 Russian, and 1/3 Ukrainian.       \n           \nIs Russian a useful language?

You can always learn Russian afterwards (this is what my plan is, btw).     \n            \nWhile you could maybe get by in large cities with Russian, that\u2019s really ignoring the fact that the USSR Russified Moldova, even pushing for a \u201cMoldovan\u201d national identity and \u201cMoldovan language\u201d to create a wedge between Romanians in Romania and the Moldavian SSR (Romania and Russia have never gotten along, not even when Romania was a communist country).

About 15\u201320% of Romanian vocabulary comes from this, meaning there are at least *some* similarities with Russian. Romanian also has some grammatical cases, which will also help.

Linguistically speaking, that is not actually the case (see my paragraphs below for more). There isn\u2019t even a single Midwest or General American accent.

That is inaccurate. Your perception of an accent as neutral comes from your experience and surroundings. To you, accents in the Midwest are neutral because they are most familiar. But to someone in Australia, for example, the Inland North American accent is dramatically different.

Plenty of vowels are pronounced in ways that many other English speakers would call strange or irregular. For example, there\u2019s the common diphthongization of the \u201cshort a\u201d vowel (/\u00e6/) in words like \u201cmap\u201d, \u201ccap\u201d, \u201clap\u201d, \u201ctrap\u201d, \u201cman\u201d, \u201csand\u201d, etc., making them sound more like \u201cmay-ap\u201d, \u201ccay-ap\u201d, etc.          \n         \nHowever, this accent exists within an accent continuum in the northern/central U.S., and that continuum\u2019s ubiquity gives many the perception of \u201cneutrality\u201d.", "created_utc": "1658186779.0", "edited": "1658188018.0", "id": "igphzx2", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_w24ay2", "parent_id": "t1_igpavxw", "score": "2", "subreddit": "CFB", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qm9d"}, {"author": "Nexus-9Replicant", "body": "That has everything to do with large cities being destinations for those non-native to those areas.

When I first started, I only used Duolingo and could not stay committed. I did this for a while and was just obsessed with my daily streak. It helped to acquire some vocabulary and very, very basic grammar, but ultimately it was a waste of time.      \n        \nSo I started to pay attention to what people at the B2\u2013C2 levels on here were recommending. I ditched all my language learning apps (I messed around with Duolingo, LingQ, Memrise, etc., although I do think LingQ is a good tool). They just weren\u2019t effective ways *for me* to learn, but I\u2019m sure they work for some other people. I then purchased a proper grammar book that came with many audio recordings of dialogues and other exercises (Colloquial Romanian); graded readers for the A1 level, A2 level, and B1 level; found a really helpful podcast (Podcastul de limba rom\u00e2n\u0103); began writing journal entries multiple times a week (sometimes daily depending on the week); began using Anki almost daily; etc.        \n         \n**Here\u2019s what I do:**        \n         \n- I have a Google Sheet where I log all of my time spent *actively* studying. I don\u2019t include any time from passive activities (like music, browsing through r/Romania, etc.). I have tags for each type of activity (reading, writing, speaking, listening, vocabulary, and grammar) so I can see where my hours are being invested. Reading is my strongest skill, so lately I have been putting less time into that and more time into listening, which is my weakest skill.         \n      \n- My Google Sheet has formulas to determine how many hours I\u2019ve spent actively studying in total, how many estimated hours I have remaining until I\u2019m at the B2 level (my short term goal), how many estimated remaining days until I reach that level, and how close I am to B2 from my current B1 as a percentage. This might seem like overkill, but for me it\u2019s really motivating to see that I am 7.5% of the way to B2 (from B1) with only 190 days remaining (estimated). It\u2019s not an exact science, but it\u2019s close enough for me to feel like I\u2019m making progress.       \n       \n- When I first started learning, I would do my full 1\u20132 hours all in one go each day. That got really exhausting and I\u2019d find myself not sticking to my daily routine/schedule and going days without studying because I dreaded having to spend so much time in one go. *Now* I break my studying up into smaller chunks spread throughout the day. During my lunch break, I\u2019ll spend 15\u201320 minutes working on my journal entry. Right after work, I\u2019ll do a reading that usually takes 30 minutes. After dinner, I\u2019ll do my listening exercises that usually take 30\u201345 minutes. Speaking isn\u2019t a daily thing. Every few days, I\u2019ll do a section of my grammar book and do the exercises associated with that.         \n       \nThat\u2019s essentially it.

Add those to your Anki deck.     \n            \nReassess your weaknesses every month or so and readjust the time spent on each task accordingly.        \n           \nFor me, reading was difficult at first. So I spent probably 75% of my time doing reading practice. Now I\u2019m very comfortable with reading and writing. However, my listening became my biggest weakness. So I began doing listening exercises 5 days a week where I would listen to a passage, listen to it again while reading the text, listen again (this time able to understand 95% without issue), then listen again while writing down what I hear to confirm that I\u2019ve heard it correctly. Now my listening is much better than it used to be. But now my vocabulary has plateaued, so I just started investing more time in vocabulary acquisition.", "created_utc": "1651605849.0", "edited": "False", "id": "i774qxv", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_uhegiw", "parent_id": "t1_i773ejp", "score": "18", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "Nexus-9Replicant", "body": "What do you currently struggle with the most (reading, speaking, writing, or listening)?", "created_utc": "1651604496.0", "edited": "False", "id": "i771ka8", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_uhegiw", "parent_id": "t1_i76w29k", "score": "5", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "Nexus-9Replicant", "body": "And there are two Dems that would vote no on abolishing the filibuster.

It's only a bit more distant from Latin than Spanish.\n\n43% of modern Romanian vocabulary does come from French and Italian (as well as additional Latin) loans, yes. But it's not like that replaced *only* words of Slavic, Turkish, or Hungarian origin. They replaced even words of Latin origin. French was simply the lingua franca at that time, and many, many Romanian figures studied in France. Naturally, neologisms found their way into Romanian. There wasn't a group of officials who suddenly decided to adopt French words into standard Romanian. It was a natural process.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>if history lead romanian to borrow 40% of its vocabulary from russian, we wouldnt call it a Slavic language would we?\n\nNo, we wouldn't. Doesn't that go against the argument you're presenting though (I know you're playing devil's advocate since you said you believe Romanian *is* a Romance language, so I don't mean to say this is *your* argument)? Romanian quite literally *descended from Vulgar Latin*. The vast majority of Romanian's core/common vocabulary *is of direct Latin descent*. Here's an analogy: English is still (correctly) considered a Germanic language despite borrowing 30% of its vocabulary from French. Romanian is still Romance. If Russian adopted 40% of its vocabulary from Chinese, it would still be a Slavic language.\n\nThe premise of this question assumes that Romanian wasn't already a Romance language before adopting some French vocabulary. That's simply not the case. Romanian is a Romance language at its core.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Gramatically speaking, I believe romanian is the only language who adds the definite article at the end, right?\n\nSo? Romanian is the closest Romance language to Latin grammatically speaking (of the 5 most spoken Romance languages: Romanian, French, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese).\n\nEach of those languages have grammar rules that weren't native to Latin.\n\nAlso, enclitic definite articles are a feature of the Balkan Sprachbund. It's not a Slavic borrowing (I think only Bulgarian and Macedonian do this, of the Slavic languages). Albanian features it as well.\n\nThere is no argument against Romanian's classification as a Romance language by any modern linguist I know of. Everyone accepts it as fact because everything points to it as fact. It descended from the Vulgar Latin that was spoken in the Balkans. It was influenced by surrounding languages, most notably Slavic (like French with Gaulish and Frankish, Spanish with Arabic, etc.), but its makeup overwhelmingly remained Romance.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>I also find it peculiar that nobody talks about Aromanian as a language that may be the closest to proto-romanian\n\nThere aren't many speakers. Plus, there are no existing documents of written Romanian prior to the 1500s, despite the language being spoken since at least the 900s (Old Church Slavonic was the literary language due to the influence of the Eastern Orthodox Church).

The idea of languages being part of language families wasn\u2019t really developed until the 1800s, when it was discovered that Sanskrit (all the way in the Indian subcontinent) shared many, many similarities with Latin and Greek.", "created_utc": "1650977216.0", "edited": "1650980444.0", "id": "i69caxq", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_ucah0t", "parent_id": "t1_i69apll", "score": "16", "subreddit": "romanian", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r3lm"}, {"author": "Nexus-9Replicant", "body": "Just guys being bros", "created_utc": "1650917742.0", "edited": "False", "id": "i66bn41", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_ubpafq", "parent_id": "t1_i65uufz", "score": "2", "subreddit": "golf", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhcs"}, {"author": "Nexus-9Replicant", "body": "Copiii would be pronounced like this (if you\u2019re familiar with IPA): /ko\u02c8pi.ji/        \n        \nWhile copii is pronounced like this: /ko\u02c8pij/         \n          \nSo the pronunciation is sort of different, but probably imperceptible to non-native speakers.
