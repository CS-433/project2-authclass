Most languages in Europe are Indo-European, so even though they're very different there still are many similarities between them due to their shared heritage (and also due to contact)\n\nIn Africa there are (at the bare minimum) 3 main language families you'd have to use: Afroasiatic, Niger-Congo and Nilo-Saharan (which likely isn't even a family) and they're VERY different from each other (at least compared to Afroasiatic, which in and of itself is a macro family, with its branches all being as old as entire language families), and that's excluding many other families like Indo-European or Khoisan (not really a family either, it's a grouping) which are also spoken there. The best you could do with Africa is probably a conlang per region rather than a continent-wide one\n\nIn Asia it's more of the same, with probably even more language families. The main ones that come to my mind as of now are Indo-European, Afroasiatic, Turkic, Mongolic, Sino-tibetan, Japonic, Koreanic, Dravidian, Austroasiatic and Austronesian, with some smaller ones like Kartvelian, Ainu or Paleo-Siberian (not a family, just a grouping). Once again they're VERY different from each other, both in terms of grammar and vocabulary, so I doubt you could make a conlang for the whole continent\n\nIn Africa and Asia there's also the fact that these languages are not only from a lot of families, but in many cases some big geographical barriers blocked contact across branches.
