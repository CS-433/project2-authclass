The brain needs to get used to understanding different grammar structures first. But, I don't think people don't have to get super proficient in that first language before picking up another, as long as they have a developed idea about how to understand new grammar\n\nBeyond that, personally I think the most beneficial is learning 2 languages at once.  \n**PROS:**  \nIf you get stuck, bored, or frustrated, then study the other language for a bit.   \nUnderstanding a concept in 1 language makes it easier to understand it in the other language.   \nWhile you won't finish both as early as if you were studying just one, I think it's possible to learn both simultaneously more quickly than if you studied just 1 after the other.   \nAny confusion is easy to fix when there's only 2 possibilities.  \n**CONS:**  \nIt's still possible to get them confused.  \nTaking in more information is harder for anyone & requires more time dedicated to learning.  \nIt takes longer than just learning 1 language\n\n3 languages increases the time needed, increases the need for a good learning plan, and increases the possibility for confusion, but overall shouldn't be too much more difficult than 2 languages imo. I wouldn't recommend more than 2 for busy people without much language experience, though\n\n4+ languages, you need a huge amount of time to dedicate, you'll need a good plan with consistency, you're much more likely to get confused (especially if you don't have a good learning plan to help keep the languages separate), and you'll have to be a lot more patient to reach big milestones. But it's possible for very dedicated individuals\n\nLearning just 1 language at a time is also acceptable and plenty of people are very successful with it. It can just slow people down if they get stuck, frustrated, or bored with it and need a break. There's no language to confuse it with, though, so that's a benefit. This is also the best choice imo for busy people, since it doesn't need as much time dedicated to it at all\n\nAs for similar or different languages, there are also pros and cons. I think they balance out & should mostly come down to preference, though  \nLearning 2 languages that are similar to each other can help with understanding grammar topics; if you understand it in one, it's easier to understand in the other. The risk of confusion increases, though  \n& Learning 2 languages that are in different language families are harder to confuse and can help prevent boredom with learning the same grammar structures, similar words, or similar phonetics, but there's more new information that has to be digested\n\n& of course, learning languages similar to one you already speak will always be easier and go much faster, I think you can learn more languages at a time if some are similar to your own language. And very different languages from your own require more time to understand & so it'll be harder to study multiple of these at once\n\nAnd now my personal experience, I've had very limited experience with French, Dutch, Greek, and Japanese throughout my time in school. This covers that first point of needing some exposure to different grammar. I also never struggled with understanding English grammar in my English classes.   \nA few years after school, I started studying 4 languages all at once August 2021, finally studying seriously. I continued Dutch and French, while adding Spanish and Russian. All European, but a few different families. I've done well to stay consistent, but it's definitely a huge time dedication that's consumed most of my time lol. & I've done a bit of Ukrainian on the side, I'm only just now about to study it more seriously, making it 5 languages that I study currently. I'm in too deep to quit any of them now, but if I had to start over, I wish I would've only picked 2 or 3 languages lol", "created_utc": "1666904730.0", "edited": "False", "id": "iu1gci0", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_yf1cjv", "parent_id": "t3_yf1cjv", "score": "1", "subreddit": "duolingo", "subreddit_id": "t5_2t6ze"}, {"author": "PhantomWithin", "body": "It should be called \"Super\" everywhere, unless you haven't updated the app on the app store.

You'll still lack vocabulary and real-time practice. While using Duolingo, you should listen to the language as much as possible (music, audiobooks, videos, live streams, anything). You'll also benefit a lot if you use other websites/programs to learn at the same time.  \nI personally really like playing video games in the target language, starting out with reading-heavy games so that I can take my time translating new words, and moving on to choice-heavy games once I understand a lot to test my comprehension level\n\nAlso, any courses with less than 4 units (based on the old tree layout) might not give you the best grasp on the language and you'll definitely be lacking with just Duo.   \n6+ units are really great courses in my experience\n\nMy course experience (since starting in August 2021):  \nDutch 6/6 units to legendary, Russian 4/4 units to legendary, Ukrainian 3/3 units to legendary, Latin 2/2 units to gold,   \n6/10 units in French to gold, almost 6/10 units to gold in Spanish.  \nI can understand a lot of Dutch, and it's taken me months after finishing the Russian course to start understanding Russian to roughly the same level.   \nI felt like I barely knew any Ukrainian or Latin after finishing the courses.   \nI can understand a decent amount of spoken French, some spoken Spanish, and a lot of written French & Spanish.   \nI still write/think slower in all the languages than I'd like to, Dutch being my best & Russian catching up\n\n(edits were for clarification & typos)", "created_utc": "1665928466.0", "edited": "1665937905.0", "id": "isjjhn9", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_y5gmjp", "parent_id": "t3_y5gmjp", "score": "11", "subreddit": "duolingo", "subreddit_id": "t5_2t6ze"}]
