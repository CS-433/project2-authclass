Genki was entirely overrated. The recent release of Tobira's \"Beginning Japanese\" is actually extremely comprehensive and so im currently using that for revision and to learn things that might not have been covered elsewhere - like pitch accent.

I then started watching anime (even knowing that anime Japanese is not the same as real life japanese) and this helped me get a feel for the usage of certain words and helped me along a bit.

I thought the end of the tankobon could have made a decent ending but I'm glad we're not necessarily leaving plot points behind without resolving them. I'll pick up the next one when it comes out, DHL shipping is like a king's ransom but also realistically the only way to get anything out of Japan at the moment (I use CDJapan to source my Japanese language volumes because they have the best range, but shipping to Australia is always really expensive). As for HotE there were a few times I was really unsure about the content, definitely more than there were reading Yaribu. But I think thats because Yaribu is marketed as silly and fluffy and does not involve so much physical harm. >!I was a bit nonplussed with the way Haoren treated Chihiro when he got jealous he was meeting Shunichi (the beer was one thing but im more referring to the rough sex at home first). I see this is being part of the wounds of growing up the way he did in the seedy part of town as an immigrant prostitute's kid, but moreso the SM club being responsible for....basically everything that went wrong with him. I also see the scars from that as probably being the reason he doesn't want Chihiro to see him naked. It's a pretty common trope and it would make sense. I like that he seemed to realise what he'd done when Chihiro started crying, and the little bits of healing we see him do the longer Chihiro is around. The dialogue at the train station did grab at my heart a bit, so I'm hoping things go a bit better from here!<", "created_utc": "1635805497.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hixuc22", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_q2lq7i", "parent_id": "t1_hiwofzf", "score": "2", "subreddit": "YarichinBitchBu", "subreddit_id": "t5_2btgnj"}, {"author": "kwonbyeon", "body": "Think of it as \"as for me (\uc800\ub294), I think of myself (\uc800 \uc790\uc2e0\uc744) as...\"\n\n\uc81c...just doesn't sound right I suppose because rather than marking it as a possessive you're more talking about how you feel about yourself as if you are observing yourself from outside.

Some people are the opposite. Everyone is going to have a different perception or experience. In term of statistics and \"reality\" its very true that there are limited pathways from a solely language or linguistics based degree into skilled work. Objectively speaking its not a bad idea to hedge your bets by looking into a double degree where the split is up to 50% something with practical application. Consider it a plan b or a back door of sorts.\n\nI'm actually 32 and came to uni late, im currently in 3rd year of a degree unrelated to languages but taking electives in German and Japanese. These classes were intended to feed my interest and to break up the monotony of my required law units for example, because I like languages and I find them easier than my law units. The idea was after being beaten up by my results in law I might get a good mark in language and feel better about myself ;) \n\nSo I would recommend doing a double with another faculty, but one you have a bit of an interest in, that has employment prospects. My younger sister has a double bachelor (were in Australia if that makes my explanation make more sense) in Arts and Education. As a result shes qualified to teach the language she majored in, as well as history and English.\n\nOr even without a double you may have options to take out of stream electives that may allow you to study languages concurrently with your main stream.", "created_utc": "1603011315.0", "edited": "False", "id": "g975l3b", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_jd3gnd", "parent_id": "t3_jd3gnd", "score": "1", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "kwonbyeon", "body": "Asap!
