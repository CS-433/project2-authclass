There are many small shops that will likely not make their places accessible for financial reasons, although some will cite historical reasons, even though the Historical Commission is familiar with disability issues (our commission works with them).\n\nThe area around Old Town Hall is our (the City's) responsibility. I walk there often and use the ramp on the east side because plazas with steps are INCREDIBLY dangerous to walk on, especially going downslope (towards Front St.).  Last week, It was blocked off by cones as in the video. Did I say how much I hate walking down plazas?\n\nWe have tried to make business owners aware of the ADA. We have had mixed results.\n\nExample: A well-known local coffee shop was planning to expand to a second location several years ago.\n\nWe reached out to the owner. He graciously offered to host our monthly meeting and meet with us.  In turn we spent most of the meeting pushing for an accessible location, hitting on all the talking points that were made in the video, and more.\n\nSeveral months later, the shop opened up its second location.\n\nIt had steps. It was in a historical building. Not just a few steps.  \n\nLots of steps. I'm not even sure if canes or walkers could navigate that. Or even if I could when it is dark in the winter afternoon.\n\nI never went there again. The owner is opening a third location. I'm not going there.\n\nThe cruelest, most galling thing we hear from restaurant owners: \"We don't get people in wheelchairs in here, so why should we serve a small population/special-interest group?\"\n\nWELL OF COURSE they don't get disabled customers! They turn them away. I'm sure that coffee-shop owner ran the numbers and determined that disabled customers did not comprise enough of a base to be profitable.\n\nNon-disabled people think the ADA is some kind of magic law. It isn't. It's often ineffectual in situations such as the OP's. As well, our commission is just an advisory board. At best, we can just use moral suasion to influence things. (Sometimes it works.)\n\nAt worst, depending on the City Council and the department heads, we serve as a placeholder for lip-service, or for blame when the rest of the city's departments avoid their responsibilities.\n\nI have been on the commission longer than almost everyone currently there, and I feel well and truly burned out and alienated.

When you choose an approach, a course, or an app, **stay with it to the end!** If you decide to take up a language on Memrise, for example, don't abandon it unless you're truly miserable over several weeks. (Reviewing vocab is not misery, it's tedium. Tedium is inescapable. It is not misery.)\n\n2. Determine how much time you can study intensively in a day. This will likely be less time than you (or others) might expect. Four hours of study will NOT give you results four times as fast as if you studied for one hour! Even if you can only focus for 30 minutes a day, hold fast to that.\n\n3. For people with ADHD or autism, a regular routine is its own success. Don't underestimate that! Especially don't discount that--routines are life itself. Even if you miss a few days a month, a routine with your new language **will** stick with you if you persist with it!\n\n4. (I said three points. But just one more!)  Remember to enjoy yourself, even if it seems impractical or inefficient! For French, I loved to put French words in Pinterest search, to bring up what French people did when they were younger. I learned so much about the French from that! I came to love French pop music! I fumble through Dutch websites--I don't truly have enough vocab to read, but I keep trying.
