Stop with the Starbucks' drinks.\n2. Basically quit alcohol. \n3. Otherwise don't drink your calories (mugicha has no calories, sugar free sodas are rarer but do exist)\n4. Eat fried food sparingly (Tempura and tonkatsu are delicious I know)\n5. Potatoes are relatively expensive but are far better calorifically than rice.\n6. Swap to brown rice at home - it's like 3/4s of the calories of white rice.\n7. Dial back junk food.\n8. Walk and/or cycle when it's viable. Is a 10 minute walk to a supermarket really too much?\n\nAlso consider an oven if you haven't already and can fit one in your place.

Most men will not think of themselves as the former, but most men can do the latter.\n\nOtherwise, just take what I'm saying as the perspective of a man who can cook and the kind of attention I get. None of it is from women who can cook who just want a man that isn't useless in the kitchen. \n\nAs for the DnD thing, the problem is you're still going to sound pretty against this niche hobby which to a guy reading your profile is not going to sound good. You'd still sound a bit of an ass if you tried explaining it, DnD players/nerds in general get a lot of shit as it is for their attitudes towards women/dating when only a small number of them are real bastards (like the general population - but bullying nerds has been acceptable for a lot of people since early childhood so people keep shitting on the easy target).\n\nBut also, DnD isn't the actual problem then is it? I'm not going to fault for you not wanting to take another chance though. \n\nYou can ask for as much as you want, but if you're not getting it, it might be worth asking why. Maybe you've literally crossed everyone off the list. Or you've crossed a lot of people off and the survivors who meet your requirements are in generally high demand and you're not getting their attention for whatever reason.\n\nThe example I like that I know some women fall into and may justify it quite aggressively as a values thing is veganism. A number of vegan women will only date guys that are at least vegetarian if not vegan. Now, in most countries, just asking for a vegan man eliminates some 97% of the population if I remember correctly. But then you have to remember that veganism rates are higher in younger people and seeing as women date older and men date younger. It's realistically worse than that. And then you've got to consider that vegan women outnumber vegan men considerably and in my experience vegan men tend to care less than vegan women about their partners dietary choices\\* so those vegan women are more likely to be competing with non-vegan women too. And this is from just one demand that I've seen someone have.\n\nGranted that's fairly extreme requirement but you're in just as bad a position if you have two requirements that each eliminate 90% of the population (assuming there's no correlation between the two you'd be left with just 1%).\n\nNow ask yourself, how many single age appropriate men interested in women there are that are in the area you would date in. Now divide that number by 100. Unless you live in a massive city, you're probably left with a very small number. Assuming you like all of those people, you've still got to find one that likes you.\n\n\\*I have theory about this. Men don't care so much because women aren't attached to meat as much as some men are who perceive meat eating as masculine or are more worried about getting their protein. \n\nI appreciate I've rambled a lot and I'm happy to keep discussing this if you are. If you want to go through your entire list of wants we can. See if we can find a better way to present them or question how important they actually are.

Get fit and to a lesser extent get muscular. You don't need to be shredded and nor do you need to be huge, you just need to have a bit of something to you so that there's no way you could be considered scrawny or just skinny/athletic. The working out to get here and stay here is pretty good for your mental health and you will almost certainly  look better (No idea what you look like now) and reap the benefits that can have.\n2. Do something with your hands that you can enjoy as a hobby. DIY is an obvious choice and working on cars another if you're into them. I actually cook and bake which is not particularly masculine, but all these things are useful in their own right, something you can take pride in progressing in and they can be ways for you to decompress and focus on something that isn't the problem you're ruminating on. If I had the space and means to get started, I'd be making knives.\n3. Learn how to look good in a suit and stop dressing liking a boy. The suit is good for interviews and your professional life when the need arises. And Jesus Christ just stop dressing like a boy if you're post university age. \n4. As a bonus point and related to number 1. Taking up a sport as a hobby is pretty good for you. It's likely going to give you face time with other guys even if it's not a team sport and it's something you can have a goal with. It's also going to help you get fit and muscular and give you some motivation to be fit and muscular - working out for the sake of being good looking is a lot less fun than if I get stronger and lighter, bouldering is going to be easier.\n\nDon't go down to the pub just to get drunk with the boys whilst watching soccer so you can feel masculine.

I was dating a model (literally could have been dating anyone) and I'm in Japan and making out in public is basically a boo boo, and the sexual tension was such that she couldn't keep her hands off me. We even got scolded by an old guy for it.

How they calculate the scores is pretty complicated and quite interesting. It's part of the reason the results take close to two months to return.\n\nShort version though is that how wrong your answers are matter.\n\nFor a given section of say 4 questions with 4 answers each there are 16 possible combinations if answers. Each of those 16 combinations will have a number of marks assigned to it (not necessarily unique)\n\nThis is why you can't guess and pass the exam.

Are they American? \n2. How's their Japanese language ability?\n\nWhy is being American significant? Well, Americans, probably due to how prevalent racism is in their own news coverage and politics view an awful number of exchanges and anything where they were treated differently (or even not) through a lens of racism. I've only ever heard two groups of people complain about racism in Japan - Americans and non-Japanese Asians. \n\nProbably going to get downvoted to hell for having said that with about half of JETs being American.\n\nIt's possible that Americans are more likely to experience what they perceive as racism. Particularly if you're near a military base - they often aren't too popular with the locals and for very good reason. And I also see Americans experiencing culture shock and having cultural/communication clashes with Japanese people and the Japan much more often, and that could be a whole separate post.\n\nBut this brings me to point 2, Japanese ability. A lot of things, especially the smaller things that happen that someone might call racist, can largely be attributed to Japanese language ability and the ability to interact with Japanese people from a culturally aware perspective. (Or a Japanese person's perception of your ability to do these things)\n\nWhen I got here and didn't and speak much Japanese, most of my co-workers didn't talk to me really and sometimes things wouldn't be communicated to me leaving me react last minute. You'll have some people call this racism and it's really not. Most of the time, for me at least, I was given or able to see that information, I just couldn't read it and the couple of people who could have explained to me in English forgot. Similarly, it's not that people didn't want to talk to me, they just felt their English wasn't good enough. I'm mostly conversational now in Japanese and most of my co-workers will happily talk to me - maybe even in English because they know I can cover any gaps in Japanese.\n\nOn a related note, how hard you're working on improving your Japanese is going to affect how you're perceived. People are super supportive and encouraging if you're really making an effort. At the other of the spectrum, people are kind of annoyed by the foreigner who's been in Japan like 10+ years and can't even speak basic (N5ish) Japanese. As we would be with immigrants who don't speak English in English speaking countries. Anecdotally, the foreigners who don't really put the effort into speaking Japanese tend to be native English speakers which Americans are going to fall into.\n\nOn a cultural communication note and I'm going to have generalize here but this is backed by all the stories I've heard from Japanese people. Even when speaking English, there's still things you can get wrong. The example that I've heard most often in that in a meeting where ideas are being discussed, Americans will be quite combative? they're likely to criticize other ideas more and argue that they are right. And this rubs people the wrong way really fast. \n\nYou can criticize ideas, but do it softly. \"Maybe it'll work, but I'm worried that if we do this that X will happen.\"  \"We can try it, but I'm not sure we'll have the time.\" \"It's a nice idea, but I think it will be too difficult for some of the students.\"  Especially as a JET, if you've cultivated any air of competency, your teachers will largely be ready to agree with you if you point out something. (Note: If you don't suggest an alternative, you might still get stuck with the idea that they presented.)\n\nSo anecdote time. Things that some people might call racist that have happened to me!\n\nAny time I've gotten to a supermarket with a girlfriend, even my own local supermarket, the cashier will reflexively look at my girlfriend for those simple questions. The old women seem to have a super short term memory about my ability to speak Japanese, but I know the other foreigners who use that supermarket speak considerably less Japanese and to them it's just easier for them to speak to a Japanese person. I do not consider the racist. Ridiculous maybe. Racist, no.\n\nJust one time! Despite being a big (now bald) guy, who used to wear way too much aftershave and have earphones on too loudly has someone moved away from me on the train - and I think my music was too loud that day. Only a couple of occasions have I experienced the phantom friend phenomenon on the train where people will just leave the seats next to me vacant. I have no idea what people do to make this a common occurrence in their lives. \n\nI was hit by a car literally yesterday. Everyone was super patient with me.

If I recall correctly, most decaf is about 7% of the original - but I'm not any more googling for this.)\n\nDecaf does makes it almost impossible to hit daily recommend limits, but it's not unreasonable to drink enough that it affects your sleep and pregnant women may still need to be careful for the heaviest drinkers - recommended limit is halved. The thing is, this was pretty true for me on cola and energy drinks too.

Whilst your weight is probably a significant factor on the casual apps for hook ups, it's not the be all and end all. Especially as a woman.\n\nI've used dating apps that indicate how popular people are, so a couple of things that are quite important are:\n\n1. You should generally be smiling in your photos - if you're doing something where you're concentrating or something, that's fine, but that shouldn't be the first photo people see of you.\n2. Actually write something. Yes, you can get matches with just a decent photo. But as a guy it's impossible to start an interesting conversation with who has written nothing or only written shit like, \"No smokers, people looking for a serious relationship only,\" with where they live and maybe what they do. Tell people who you are and if possible write something about you that's true but in a funny? way. For example, my tagline on my profile is, \"I don't drink tea etc. even though I'm English.\" I live in Japan, so I'm playing against one of the stereotypes - and people do bring this up sometimes when they talk to me (also let's them know where I'm from).\n3. Put on display what separates you from other people. This doesn't have to be a single thing, it can be a rare combination. For me it's baking. It's far from the biggest aspect of who I am, but it really sets me apart from every other guy that sends a message. It also plays into the rare combination of being a big guy (kinda muscular and bald) but also has \"feminine\" hobbies. Is it going to make me wildly popular? No. It doesn't have to. But it's practically kryptonite to some women.\n\nGoing back to your weight, it might matter in and of itself. But it probably matters more in indirect ways. Affecting your confidence - and there's a good chance you still feel bigger than you actually are. You might still be \"hiding\" away from attention when you're out in the real world. I had bigger problems with my appearance so I can't use my own weight loss story really, but accepting my face for what it is, and later my balding made a big difference to my confidence and my dating success. Similarly, realizing that when judging attractiveness, people tend to focus on the things they like over the things they don't. Women will admire my eyes (not just Japanese women - they're that pale glassy grey-blue and sometimes change colour) and they can literally stare at my eyes and they won't even notice or acknowledge that one of my eyelids sags and is not symmetrical. Likewise, they pay more attention to the fact I'm muscular than the fact I'm a bit overweight.\n\nLosing weight helps, but I believe it's true value lies in giving you a better chance at repairing your body image, self-esteem and confidence.\n\nEdit: I appreciate you might not actually be looking for advice on how to use a dating app, but if you've not taken them \"seriously\" before, you might not actually know any of that.", "created_utc": "1656298608.0", "edited": "1656298795.0", "id": "idvvann", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_vl3h8c", "parent_id": "t3_vl3h8c", "score": "4", "subreddit": "loseit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rz8w"}, {"author": "Valentine_Villarreal", "body": "Gluttony and sloth are generally considered to be sins and fat people are rightly or wrongly accused of being guilty of both.\n\n/thread", "created_utc": "1656292717.0", "edited": "False", "id": "idvja9g", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_vl013y", "parent_id": "t3_vl013y", "score": "2", "subreddit": "loseit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rz8w"}, {"author": "Valentine_Villarreal", "body": "Honestly.

Address that first.\n\nDon't address everything at once, you would just crush someone's confidence.\n\nFor more specific examples, in Japanese, at the early stages of learning, I would sort out \u3089\u30fb\u308c\u30fb\u308b\u30fb\u308c\u30fb\u308d and \u3064 pronunciations as well as common \u3063 pronunciations that occur frequently in conjugated words. \u3064 and \u3063 are kind of important because getting them wrong can easily make it sound like you're saying a different word.

Cook pork until mostly browned, add ginger, when pork is fully browned, add teriyaki sauce and orange juice and once bubbling, add corn starch slurry. \n\nI typically throw in bell peppers or broccoli to bulk it out so the 45ml of teriyaki sauce might be a bit much if you're just doing the meat.", "created_utc": "1655448779.0", "edited": "False", "id": "icoju79", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_ve0rnn", "parent_id": "t1_icoh0ke", "score": "1", "subreddit": "AskMen", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s30g"}, {"author": "Valentine_Villarreal", "body": "I'm not a professional baker.\n\nAlthough I do live alone, bake weekly and of course am only baking what I want to eat.\n\nSometimes it's tough.

Looking at full-time workers only it's basically the same kind of balance only that the numbers are smaller - and again nothing to say that the difference isn't because some men work whilst having partners stay at home.\n\n>In 2008, a study by the University of Michigan found that having a husband creates, on average, about seven more hours of housework per week for women.\n\nAre we seriously using studies about married people from 15 years ago as a source for saying things haven't changed?\n\nIt's a really bad article to cite to suggest things haven't changed or aren't changing. \n\nAnecdotally, (not to be taken as real evidence) the men around me are on board with doing an even share of the household chores if their partner is working as well, some of them are doing it. The biggest problem I see here is cooking, a lot of men still don't know how to do more than the basics and some women like to cook - so maybe it shouldn't be considered a chore. (It largely should be, I'm a guy but I do the cooking in my relationships and even if it's more satisfying than most chores, it's still work - but I wouldn't consider all the research I do as part of time spent on chores)\n\nThings are not going to change much for a given generation, the change is going to take place as younger people grow up with different values that they carry into relationships.\n\nI do not have time to pick apart the other sources, but consider that you haven't looked at them critically enough (or at least updated them recently) or that when you search for evidence in Google, Google is giving results to match your bias (this does happen).\n\nJust judging from the link, the 2nd source is probably biased.", "created_utc": "1655175059.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ica8s8r", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_vbjvcz", "parent_id": "t1_ica2knq", "score": "1", "subreddit": "funny", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh33"}, {"author": "Valentine_Villarreal", "body": "Sugar consumption going up is part of a bigger trend which would be worse if not for the sugar tax that appears to have had an effect.", "created_utc": "1655172298.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ica315y", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_vbjm0a", "parent_id": "t3_vbjm0a", "score": "1", "subreddit": "ukpolitics", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhcv"}, {"author": "Valentine_Villarreal", "body": "It is exactly contributing.
