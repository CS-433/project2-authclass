My guess is that your lessons and your surroundings aren't speaking in the same accent.\n\nVietnamese has 3 different regional accents, and even natives can have a rough time understanding others from different parts of the country. For example, my family and I speak the northern accent/dialect, but I can only understand ~70% of the someone speaking the southern accent (at least, on the first pass). Don't even get me started on the central accent.\n\nIf I had to draw a parallel to English, imagine if you grew up in a big American city and tried listening to someone from Glasgow talk really fast. You'd have some difficulty understanding, even as a native English speaker with a lifelong education. For Vietnamese, the northern and southern accents are both pretty prominent, but it's usually the northern accent that gets taught to foreigners since that's what you hear in music and TV.\n\nAs for your other question, I'm actually learning another tonal language myself (Cantonese), but my experience is probably not going to be like yours since I was never a stranger to tones. Viet and Canto each have 6 tones, but only about 3 of those tones overlap, meaning I had to learn to hear and produce 3 new tones. What I've learned in this process is that your tone usage doesn't have to be 100% on the needle. Native speakers talk fast, and everyone uses their tones a little differently. As long as you're consistent and reasonably accurate, you can be understood even if a mistake slips through once or twice.

Consider this: the only time you ever rely on the advantage of an alphabetical script (e.g. slowly sounding out a word from left-to-right) is when you encounter a word you've never seen before. In contrast, words you *have* seen before will skip that process entirely and get instantly recognised by your brain (just like a Chinese character). It's why we're still able to coherently read sentences even if every word were misspelled.\n\nFurthermore, you can take an even bigger shortcut (as a foreign learner) and simply neglect the whole aspect of hand-writing Chinese characters. Unless you live in China/Taiwan/HK etc. you won't ever need to write characters by hand. We live in an era of phones and keyboards; if you can simply *recognise* characters (as opposed to correctly conjuring them from scratch), you're good to go.

Surviving without a kill is better than willingly dying.\n\n-Avoid parts of the map that don't suit your loadout. If you aren't packing a sniper or a pulse, avoid long lines of sight and wide open areas. Likewise, if you don't have a shotgun or Recluse, stay out of tight spaces and little hotspots with lots of entrances.\n\n-Don't fight the meta.
