You can read more about it and how it started being used on right-wing internet subcultures here.](https://www.dictionary.com/e/slang/based/)\n\nNowadays and in recent years, however, the meaning became very much detached from that right-wing origin and most people using it probably doesn't know where it comes from.

One thing i really liked about surfermoon was that the chords for all songs from an album were displayed on a single page, which allowed you to easily play one song after the other. I would often end up playing the whole album. So I think it'd be nice to have a page for each albums that just shows all the chords from each songs, like it did on surfermoon. The link could just be at the top of the tracklisting or next to the \"Track Listing\" header.\n\nOne additional thing that I would like but wouldn't beg for since it wasn't on the original site and would be more work to implement is the ability to display chords in their original form. On surfermoon, on a lot of songs, if not most of them, any song written in a key that's less convenient for guitar would have the chords transposed to another key, usually a half-step up or down (for exemple a song in Eb would have the song in E.) As a piano player, I definitely prefer to play a song in it's original key and would often have to mentally remember to play half a step higher or lower. If there was a way to choose between the two, that'd be neat.\n\n[I'm not a programmer/coder, but i found this for html that seems useful.](https://github.com/ostankin/html-chords)  \nIt would allow transposition to any key as well as an easy way to place chords above certain lyrics without lines of dots.\n\nOf course this suggestion is a lot more work than the first, so please don't feel pressured to implement it.", "created_utc": "1614120547.0", "edited": "False", "id": "goinpli", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_lqpysx", "parent_id": "t1_goidupb", "score": "5", "subreddit": "thebeachboys", "subreddit_id": "t5_2shwh"}, {"author": "McMemile", "body": "Finding original image with no funny colors \u2260 original image isn't fake", "created_utc": "1613881338.0", "edited": "False", "id": "go701pr", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_loiwcd", "parent_id": "t1_go6driy", "score": "10", "subreddit": "PoliticalCompassMemes", "subreddit_id": "t5_3ipa1"}, {"author": "McMemile", "body": ">\u201cWe think the Beach Boys is an underappreciated trademark,\u201d Azoff said in an interview. \u201cThey are just not as important as they could and should be.\u201d\n\n>\u201cThe music has been around for nearly 60 years, and there are generations of people who have yet to discover the depth.\u201d\n\n>\"Iconic is developing a business plan right now for the Beach Boys\u2019 anniversary in 2022, which will include a channel on SiriusXM and the use of old interviews that have never been seen.\"\n\n>Azoff blames decades of friction and division among members of the group for their fall from rock\u2019s Mount Rushmore. Those troubles prevented them from coordinating on projects that could catalyze interest, like documentaries and music rereleases.\n\nLots of interesting quotes here. The buyer clearly understands that The Beach Boys should have the same same cultural status in the mainstream as The Beatles or Queen, yet they don't, especially among younger people and beyond their surf rock image. I mean, who has heard of Friends or Surf's Up outside of forums about the band or groups of dedicated music nerds? They have a tiny social media presence that seems to be mostly followed by older folks and a twitter bio that's still just an advertisement for the The Royal Philharmonic Orchestra album. I'm pretty optimist that they could hopefully somewhat revemp the band's legacy. The Beach Boys deserve better, and it would be hard to manage the band's image and material worse than they currently are. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n[Also I found another article that includes quotes by Brian, Mike and Al discussing the deal](https://www.rollingstone.com/pro/features/beach-boys-rights-sale-azoff-1129316/)", "created_utc": "1613845712.0", "edited": "1613864857.0", "id": "go55pw5", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_lob3tx", "parent_id": "t3_lob3tx", "score": "58", "subreddit": "thebeachboys", "subreddit_id": "t5_2shwh"}, {"author": "McMemile", "body": "my fav radiohead album", "created_utc": "1613749111.0", "edited": "False", "id": "go0kbyh", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_ln5p0x", "parent_id": "t1_go0intp", "score": "4", "subreddit": "weezer", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s48r"}, {"author": "McMemile", "body": "Ok, two months old account with no other comments or post.", "created_utc": "1613747984.0", "edited": "False", "id": "go0hwhw", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_ln5p0x", "parent_id": "t1_go090mj", "score": "6", "subreddit": "weezer", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s48r"}, {"author": "McMemile", "body": "Iceberg Level 'The Patient' is without description.", "created_utc": "1613613707.0", "edited": "1613625582.0", "id": "gnu6hjn", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_lm74q1", "parent_id": "t3_lm74q1", "score": "9", "subreddit": "TheCaretaker", "subreddit_id": "t5_yhdh1"}, {"author": "McMemile", "body": "I'm on about being a normie weezer/billy cobb listener who didn't know that, sorry\n\nedit: damnit you successfully gaslit me for a moment", "created_utc": "1613441569.0", "edited": "1613447929.0", "id": "gnlo15r", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_lks2ch", "parent_id": "t1_gnln180", "score": "1", "subreddit": "weezer", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s48r"}, {"author": "McMemile", "body": "I have listened to that song before and it still distinctly sounds like Billy to me.

One of the evidences for this theory is the [very sudden cut off of the drone music] (https://youtu.be/CjlbuJfWOiE?t=899) that happens shortly before the song is played and would symbolize death.

Who the fuck ever said girls can't do girly things or men can't be masculine. Or find me one instance of mainstream media like msn, celebrities or democratic politicians saying being white is racist or that we should kill all men.\n\nOf course these examples were made-up wojack strawmen, so it's not surprsing if it's hard to find any real life example. An example of a PCM post that looks closer to the format of my meme is [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/hf8vr4/yes/). Notice how it conveniently leaves out the number of likes or replies. I just googled the tweet's text and the poster's tweeter handle @katilinwilde and found two tweets:\n\n1. [The exact same post, word-for-word](https://twitter.com/EmillySwaven/status/1279497815446732802) by another account with a generic name and profile picture, posted a few months later and with \"Stop the K word\" both in her bio and banner. Despite Twitter's left-wing bias, everyone in the replies were roasting her, including black and LGBT people. \n\n2. [A tweet by another user](https://twitter.com/Kanto255/status/1278630011478642689) who screenshot a retweet by @katilinwilde, the original poster in the PCM screenshot. The tweet she retweeted shows a rather surprising hot take for someone talking about assuming George Floyd's pronouns. Clicking on katilin's handle reveals her account was suspended. Surprise, the tweet everyone on this sub was loosing their mind about was another troll account. Even on that original tweet, [people were exclusively calling her out.](https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/hf8vr4/yes/fvw203x/)\n\nAnd that's not talking about MAPs. Having used twitter, or other subreddits, I can confirm they are seen as much of a joke everywhere on the internet as they are here. And that investigating the profiles of people claiming to be one will just reveal an over-the-top caricature that never talks about anything else.

So from my picture, I cut out the element that stood out as being closer to the viewer, which were the pole and the guy holding it, and the bench to the right. I then turned on 3d for these layers and brought them closer in z-space, the pole being moved the furthest, all while adjusting the scale so that they look approximately the same size. Because these layers are gonna move around and reveal \"stuff\" behind them that you don't have in the picture, you're gonna have to do some guessing and use the clone stamp on the main picture to approximate what would be behind the layers you isolated. You could then use a camera with a wiggle expression to shake everything around or parent the layers to a null.\n[This tutorial](https://youtu.be/FraYqnnkxrk) is pretty much the idea, a beginner could probably understand it.\n\nOther effects include using an adjustment layer to pump up the red and blue in the curve effect to give the right tint, and more adjustment layers with feathered masks to target areas around neons that would be brighter. I also used semi-opaque pink solids. Most of these layers have their opacity affected by a wiggle expression to make the neons flicker, which you would probably want to sync using parenting.\n\nUsing keyframes, I also timed an adjustment layer to lower the RBG curve when I made a black solid pass behind the window\n\nBoth windows were made using masks in substract mode on the main picture and placing stuff behind them.\n\nThe japanese characters to the right were made in a pre-composition using a free plugin called [Saber](https://www.videocopilot.net/blog/2016/03/new-plug-in-saber-now-available-100-free/) and by tracing over japanese characters. I then placed their anchor point in the center of the wall at the end of the wagon and keyframed their scale, so that they both move to the right and appear to get slightly bigger in size as they approach the window.\n\nThe skyline is just [something i found on google image](https://i.imgur.com/MNY8UjN.png) that I added a purple glow on, and I animated an outrun sun to go behind it.

Sure, the spelling is a bit wonky as it can be hard to know how a word is pronounced from the spelling alone, but the grammar is incredibly simple. There barely are any [agreement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agreement_\\(linguistics\\)): because there are no grammatical genders for non-humans, adjectives are always written the same, and there are only one definite article and two indefinite, *the*, *a* and *an*. Plural doesn't affect adjectives as well, and you only need to add an *s* or follow mostly consistent rules at the end of nouns. Keep in mind that [French isn't the exception among Western languages for having grammatical genders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_languages_by_type_of_grammatical_genders), English is for not having them. Spanish, French, Italian, Russian, and German all have grammatical genders, the latter even having a third, *neutral* gender.\n\n[Conjugation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_conjugation) might be the easiest things about English. Take an arbitrary verb, say [love](https://conjugator.reverso.net/conjugation-english-verb-love.html). There is a grand total of *four* different way you can write this verb: *love*, *loves*, *loved*, and *loving*. The grammatical person almost never matters except for one case, the singular third person of the present tense. If the verb is irregular, the conjugation table still consists of about 5 different forms repeated a bunch of time. Compare that to the conjugation table of [the same arbitrary verb](https://leconjugueur.lefigaro.fr/conjugaison/verbe/aimer.html) in French. There are plenty of different way to conjugate a verb, and they each have a different form according to the person and a bunch of different tenses. There's a reason why reference book for conjugation are found in nearly every grammar class of French speaking students, while in English, a single sheet with a list of irregular verb and their two forms in the [preterit] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preterite) and past participle is all you'll ever need.\n\nIn French, all the rules about gender and agreement lead to even more problems and arbitrary rules. The most infamous example is probably this: Behold, *[the past participle agreement decision tree](https://i.imgur.com/JRIIeZw.png)* that you have to learn in French class from elementary school all the way to your last year of high school, among other dozens grammar rules, while native English speakers will have moved on to mostly writing and reading in their 1st language class. Actually, that decision tree doesn't even cover all the rules, but it was the most complete I could find. For example, if the past participle with the verb *avoir* (to have) is placed after the object of a sentence *and* is followed by the infinitive form of a verb (e.g. *These birds, I have seen them fly*),[ you have to wonder whether the object *\\(the birds\\)* are the one committing the infinitive verb](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accord_du_participe_pass%C3%A9_en_fran%C3%A7ais#Participe_pass%C3%A9_suivi_d'un_infinitif). In this example, that is the case, but that won't always be true in French. Only after pondering upon this question will you be able to know whether to make sure there is agreement with the object. Which usually won't even affect the pronunciation.\n\nLast of all, most grammar rules that English do have are actually *audible* when speaking. This means that you automatically and intuitively pick up on them as you listen to English media. Half of the time, if not most of the time, agreement and other grammar rules in French do not affect pronunciation, only spelling, since we French speakers don't bother pronouncing the last few letters of a word most of the time. Might be because I'm not a native speaker, but I can't think of any grammar rule in English that you just *have* to know. The only things English speakers have to worry about when writing but not when speaking are homophones, which seem to mostly come from contractions and follow intuition. Obviously, homophones are also a thing in other languages.\n\n\n**TL;DR:** English can have pretty arbitrary spelling and pronunciation, but those you automatically learn over time, while having practically no grammar rule that you just have to memorize and can't be learned by listening to English speech.\n\nFully anecdotal, but I made less spelling mistakes writing English essays than French ones.", "created_utc": "1609101567.0", "edited": "1609104755.0", "id": "gh7uuk4", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_kl41op", "parent_id": "t1_gh7gaua", "score": "13", "subreddit": "youtubehaiku", "subreddit_id": "t5_2tqlz"}, {"author": "McMemile", "body": "That's the same as 9/11, you mean 2*(9/11) = 18/11", "created_utc": "1608753828.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ggttfw8", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_kivrlu", "parent_id": "t1_ggt7ywx", "score": "11", "subreddit": "HazbinHotel", "subreddit_id": "t5_igfxt"}, {"author": "McMemile", "body": "[I personally prefer the remix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqdJcLzVRvs)\n\nIn any case, absolutely one of the band's greatest song, any era considered.", "created_utc": "1608743921.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ggtafw8", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_kitkg6", "parent_id": "t3_kitkg6", "score": "2", "subreddit": "thebeachboys", "subreddit_id": "t5_2shwh"}, {"author": "McMemile", "body": "[Not his, unfortunately](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCaretaker/comments/jbt29r/i_rearranged_the_tape_and_it_looks_great_what_do/)", "created_utc": "1608654624.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ggpcw6r", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_ki2xml", "parent_id": "t1_ggonzps", "score": "8", "subreddit": "TheCaretaker", "subreddit_id": "t5_yhdh1"}, {"author": "McMemile", "body": "Hey, the change at 0:46 isn't scary and completely unexpected anymore!", "created_utc": "1608502425.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ggivor1", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_kh23on", "parent_id": "t3_kh23on", "score": "3", "subreddit": "TheCaretaker", "subreddit_id": "t5_yhdh1"}, {"author": "McMemile", "body": "the inner machinations of my mind are an enigma", "created_utc": "1608223252.0", "edited": "False", "id": "gg5lj3z", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_kex9lm", "parent_id": "t3_kex9lm", "score": "41", "subreddit": "TheCaretaker", "subreddit_id": "t5_yhdh1"}, {"author": "McMemile", "body": "My obvious pick has to be the [\"Surf's Up\" footage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbswOqC4cVU) from Inside Pop.

At the time Berghain was about to explode on the international club scene as a temple. The feeling was in the air that something special was happening. I went and saw a pale shadow of the past. Grim and boring beats, endlessly pounding to an audience who felt they were part of an experience but who lacked cohesion and energy. For me personally something had died. Be it a spirit, be it an ideal, be it an adventure in sound. Rave and techno felt dead to me.\n\n> The original \u2018The Death Of Rave\u2019 project was vast, over two-hundred flashbacks, using all of the dance floor hits from the time and stripping theme of energy and spirit, turning them into shadows and ghosts. The material pre-dates the recent obsession younger musicians have for re-creating remembered rave textures and memories. This was not nostalgia, It was an inverted paean to a time when the music was about bringing people together for a shared experience. A time when only the music, advancement of sound and getting on one mattered.\n\n> Of course \u2018The Death Of Rave\u2019 was vast, too vast to digest. It was available for free download for a number of years via the V/Vm Test label. In the end the \u2018The Death Of Rave\u2019 died itself when the V/Vm Test website was deleted in full in 2008. In the intervening years I have at various times re-visited the work. And so eight tracks were lifted from the project and have now been remastered by Matt Colton as a \u2018document from a dead past\u2019. A monument to a lost work, an idea finally set in stone via a physical format. Proof of its existence.\n\n> Ivan Seal himself a veteran of the original \u2018rave times\u2019 provides the glorious cover artwork in keeping with all \u2018History Favours The Winners\u2019 releases. The track-listing is in reference to the strongest rave-memories I have from those nights. The people, the DJ\u2019s, the cars, the violence and the long lost clubs. Flashbacks only, now consigned to my own dusty experiences.\n\n> \" 'They danced like they never had before. They danced in the darkest hour before daybreak.\u2019 It\u2019s dead now, over. Long may it live...\u201d\n\n----------\n\n> \u201cCollective memory was the subject of the Death Of Rave project, inspired by Kirby\u2019s participation in the Manchester club scene of the late eighties and early nineties. Recalling the surge years of rave between 1988-96, Kirby says \u2018\u2019Everyone thought everything was possible on those long nights. The World was ours. Now I think this generation is very disillusioned. They saw a glimpse of light on the dance floors, but that light has gone out and the future seems grim and predictable.\u2019\u2019\n\n> \u2013 Simon Reynolds \u2018Retromania\u2019", "created_utc": "1605843562.0", "edited": "False", "id": "gcwnxqx", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_jxe789", "parent_id": "t1_gcw3nts", "score": "3", "subreddit": "TheCaretaker", "subreddit_id": "t5_yhdh1"}, {"author": "McMemile", "body": "The Mollusk is great, and I love seeing Ween rep, but because it's their most popular, I feel like people just listen to that one, like it, throw it in the mid-bottom of their list and move on, even though it's not even the best Ween album.

If you do that's fine, I know I won't change your mind anyway. Worth noting that this book is not the one from your other article that's targeted to kids, this one is for older 16+ teenagers in high school.\n\nAs for the stuff about \"fisting\", \"bondage\" or \"blood play\", yeah there is a chapter in that book for high school students about \"kinky\" sex. After seeing some angry comments about it in the 1-star amazon reviews, I decided to sail the high seas to see what the fuss is all about. The chapter describes what exactly those kinks are, their \"nicknames\" their risks, and how to do it safely if you are going to engage in them. It doesn't shy away from describing it bluntly, but less so than the porn they are watching does, if I may argue.\n\nHere's an exempt from the \"fisting\" section\n>More involved, as it were, manual sex is colloquially called fisting, but that\u2019s not because you make a fist and try to put it into a vagina or anus, which is unlikely to be anything but painful, if not impossible. Rather, this kind of manual sex involves starting with one or two gloved fingers (and lube, added as you go) and slowly working up to more, as it is\u2014and only if it is\u2014pleasurable for the receptive partner.\n\nHere's an exempt from the  infamous \"Blood play\" section:\n>But from an infection and disease perspective, fluid play can be dangerous, especially when body fluids have contact with incredibly sensitive sites like the eyes. Whereas urine itself is sterile, it does pass through the urethra, where an infection may be present. Ejaculate can carry several different infections. Contact with blood, or cutting or piercing partners in any way, opens the door to some of the deadlier diseases and infections out there, like hepatitis B and HIV.\n\n>So, for the most part, this sort of play is quite risky, especially for younger couples, the majority of whom have not had sound or regular sexual health care. Most younger people have not had safer sex with a monogamous partner long enough to be safely \u201cfluid-bonded.\u201d\n\n>STI risk: Very high risk.\n\n>Pregnancy risk: No risk, unless semen comes into contact with a vulva.\n\nThere's a difference between *encouraging* and *describing* something for what it is. As I said in my other comment, it's better for people to learn about these kinks safely in a book than in porn or with some strangers they met at a bar.", "created_utc": "1597552010.0", "edited": "1597555828.0", "id": "g1pfuo3", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_iabck4", "parent_id": "t1_g1p7quk", "score": "6", "subreddit": "PoliticalCompassMemes", "subreddit_id": "t5_3ipa1"}, {"author": "McMemile", "body": "None of the pictures provided of the textbook mention \"fisting\", \"bondage\" or \"blood play\", the only source for that is something a certain parent named Andrew said in a video posted on \"the conservative group Our Watch\", so I'm personally a bit skeptical of these claims.\n\nAs for stuff like oral/anal sex, yeah I would rather that they learn how to do that stuff safely from school than from porn which they will inevitably find out about. I think the age of 12 is a good starting point for this as a few teenagers have sex as early as at 13 years old, whether you teach them about safe-sex or not.
