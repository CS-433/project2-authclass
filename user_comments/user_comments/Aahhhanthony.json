Two is so much work and the fact that you haven't done a language before will make it even more. And it's really hard to understand just how much work it is because you don't have anything to parse. It's better to develop a better skill with the time it would take to get both to a fluent level. If I could go back, I'd have done that (maybe), despite my utter love for both languages.\n\nAnd knowing just how hard both of them are has made it so that I really don't think I'll even touch Korean again until I'm well into my 40s.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSeriously, to learn Japanese and Chinese is an extremely lofty goal and you will either learn both to a very mediocre level or it'll consume you. I'm extremely fortune to have been given  (and also worked for) all the opportunities that were thrown my way that helped me get to where I am with these languages.

This is also an option, especially if you actually want to get something out of all your hard work earlier on in the journey. I think I'm the only one of my friends who actually got fluent in multiple langugaes that I committed to at the same time. Most of my other friends either a) dropped the languages after 3-4 years of studying because it was too difficult and adult life killed their drive to study, or b) studied one language, got a job in that country, lived there for a while and decided to finally learn the 3rd (or 4th) language.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI think that this issue with wanting to learn multiple languages is really complex with people who like Asian languages because of how complex they are.

Doesn't mean it's true or not. For me, it is absolutely 120% the best way to study and develop your skills.\n\nI think the best way to do it is reading>listening>writing>speaking.\n\nReading allows you to build up a huge vocabulary, get used to grammar structures, find texts that are challenging, yet comprehensible, and dissect every little thing on the page. \n\nListening gets you to internalize all that you learned from reading on another \"level\" (or maybe \"medium\" is the better word) and further practice all the same skills. Plus, now you'll start hearing accents, intonation, etc. \n\nThen you can move onto writing once you've hit a fairly high-ish level in reading and listening. This allows you to practice everything you've learned slowly. Right off the bat, you will be able to make fairly complex sentences and talk about complex topics. Once you keep doing it too, you can start to change up your expressions and figure out different ways to convey the same idea. You can also practice speaking/your accent with what you write and memorize small monologues to help you ease into speaking.\n\nThen, speaking kind of all comes together. Plus, you'll generally have a much better accent this way because you won't fall into bad habits due to all the input. On top of that, you'll probably have a really strong grasp on how to talk about things and won't need to really force the partner to dumb things down or worry about much. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n My accent on my languages that I've learnt by speaking since day 1 vs when I did this method is lightyears different. And Chinese required A LOT of work to undo a lot of the issues that were caused by trying to practice speaking early. You do get to \"use\" the language earlier, but I'm not one who cares about basic conversations and whatnot. I want to use the language to form deep connections, which isn't possible until a higher level anyways.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOverall, it's up to who you are as a learner and your goals with the language. This fits my goals the best. But if you goal is just to be \\*amazing\\* at the language, but don't need to use it right off the best, then this is absolutely the route I recommend to everyone. Of course, you won't be holding off on writing and speaking until you are super high. You will have to do it here and there. But it just won't be the focus until later. And also writing and speaking about things is much easier if you read an article on it beforehand, vs trying to do everything on the fly.

That's not all of them, but it's most of them.\n\nAnd I know it is a sliver of the population, but even then you still should not doubt that people can do it. Just now you have a more trained eye to understand *what* goes into it and understand how difficult it is to truly get \"fluent\". And this eye will make you more skeptical. But also realize that you are missing a lot of pieces to the puzzle still that are making your journey slower. For instance, you talk about trying out different methods. But then you have someone like me who not only knows a ton of methods and which ones work for me, but I also know how to apply those methods and keep it interesting. I know where to find the challenging materials I want to read and how to quickly parse what I want to read. I also know how to force myself into reading and taking the dive into the deep. This took practice to build this methodology, which you are just now getting. But imagine you keep learning Spanish for 3 more years and decide to learn Polish. Do you know that you will be a lot more quick with it because you know a lot about linguistics, as well as what methods to try and which to skip (e.g. you probably won't even touch something like Duolingo and maybe not even a beginner textbook).  And I realized that this only gets quicker with each language you learn. I learnt Russian completely on my own and it taught me so much about the language learning process that I feel like I could get to a huge level in Italian in a year probably.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd how many hours a day isn't the only factor. it's how you practice. If you are not constantly challenging yourself, you won't improve. Plain & Simple. So these hours all mean something different. I can sit here and listen to talk shows in Chinese where people talk about their lives/history/struggles/whatever in Chinese, but this won't even improve me anymore. Now...if I listen to someone talk about geopolitics and analyze how this played into strategic decisions in history, I will learn more Chinese. Another example is say we both start studying Polish tomorrow and spend an hour every day on it. You use duolingo and a beginner textbook to help get you to a decent understanding of the language. Meanwhile, I will pull up a grammar chart that has all the tenses and cases on it and read a graded reader for someone just beginning and read it in the manner that I already know works best for me and then recap by listening to someone read that (while I follow along) for the last 5-10 mins. Whose hour do you think will get them more progress in 3 months?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe most important thing is that you are putting in the work and showing up every day.
