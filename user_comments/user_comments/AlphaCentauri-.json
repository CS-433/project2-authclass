She gets health insurance and money from work once a month since retiring. i think the biggest asset she has is the home. it was finally paid off actually 2 months before I moved back in. The rent I pay is the association for this residence and half the electricty, etc. \n\nedit. i'm going to try and talk to her about her accounts and stuff, but she has been isolating in her room the past few days. i have left her be. we are supposed to go out for brunch tomorrow, so maybe i will broach it then\n\nThank you for the thoughts and wishes. i honestly thought that when it 'finally happened' I would be at a point in life to stand on my own two feet w/ a significant other. I thought college was gonna be the ticket to a better life. but getting this news in probably the most unstable part of my adult life has thrown my previously-thought-to-have-already-grieved emotions and planning into turmoil\n\nit is also a bit ironic that this is happening in my childhood home.

It was on a college campus :T albeit the location is heavily white, both Hispanic & not. it hurts me on the inside to see. This was not a thing when I was growing up. the conversations I heard, ironically, were for a different biracial group. The Hapas, half-asian/half-white. (i'm not mixed asian but grew up in an asian majority environment). The discourse for them (at least 10 years ago) was focused on bashing their White Fathers for being Fetishizing\u2122\ufe0f, Creeps, and other negative stereotypes. You were seen as higher status amongst the Hapa community if you were raised with an Asian Father and White Mother. it was explained to me that AF/WM were seen as relationships of love, equal footing. on the other end, it was pity for the poor asian woman who has to be subservient to her white husband. they are seen with a power imbalance. it treats these people, of all mixes, that they are kids who cannot make choices for themselves, but were instead 'tricked'.\n\nThe irony does not miss me. it has been enlightening to learn how biracial people who have a monoracial White Parent handle these issues and where they diverge and for what reasons. \n\ni am not biracial, but my mother is. she was also the one to raise me.

I also studied far from Tokyo, so there's less experience with international ppl\n\n**Native Japanese:** don't believe i'm american at first. asked straight up where in Africa i'm from. when explaining that i'm mixed race (which isn't really a concept in Japan; you're either full Japanese born AND raised in Japan or you're just not really Japanese & considered an 'other') i received a lot of 'zoo animal' type curiosity lol. i was actually surprised to see their reactions. often, it wouldn't even cross their mind that it is pretty normal to mix races like that. they held a very white-centric view of America (the idealized cowboy came up a lot).\n\n**Koreans, Chinese, Vietnamese, & (1) Malaysian International Students**\n\n* once again met with surprise when they found out I was born/from the USA\n* less stereotypes. like if you're not (ugh I hate typing this) dark-skinned black in these countries you're just seen/treated as indifferent/neutral. the general wariness of basically all 'foreigners'\n* the malaysian girl had the best reaction. she considers herself mixed (ethnically) but monoracial. however, Malay being super mixed brought an ease to our convos. like i wasn't treated like an object and could actually talk about race w/ someone who understands\n\n**Polish, Dutch, Italians, Brazilians, & Other United States International Students**  \n*People of these nationalities never questioned my Americanness nor made a point about my skin color.* \n\n* polish: race didn't come up. super westernized, hates the racism in Poland for non-whites. \n* dutch: race also didn't come up, no big deal. they actually mentioned, like the other commenter, that they had friends with Indo-Dutch mixed ppl. could actually tell i was mixed with black bc they lived in an international city\n* italians: neutral, tending toward microaggressions. didn't want to engage w/ me as much as the other Americans. although, once i bonded w/ one bc we are both lgbt, i was no longer treated with the wanting to touch hair and i was invited to hang out\n* brazilians: ah yes, the other extremely mixed country. totally kicked it off. we were about the same skin tone too which helped in feeling less alone. BUT here's an interesting tidbit: Brazil had a lot of Japanese immigration, so there's many mixed w/ that. She had a higher level japanese than me and was able to integrate better. she told me though that they had made a comment about her father (Japanese) that \"they couldn't believe someone like her could come from a japanese person\". which i was shook to hear that, like it took me OUT. so yeah\n* the other americans: they were all white. multiculturally, there was only one, who is white, but was raised on a reservation and holds tribal affiliation. we got along just fine. and they had all met mixed race people before. i didn't really get microaggressions, but I was stereotyped (\"hey there's KFC, it's your ppl's food!\"; \"teach me how to play american football\"; anytime a rap song played i was elbowed and nudged and expected to know it). they didn't beat around the bush with the wonderful age old question \"What are you???\"\n\nWow this got way longer than I intended.

I was the first grandchild and thus the first cousin, and it stayed that way for 7 years or so. After my cousins were around 5-6ish my mom would take us all out to the beach and hang out.

Yes, I am an introvert now, but I certainly wasn\u2019t as an child. My mom helped this by taking me out to the park, playground, etc. every weekend and while she sunbathed I would make friends with other kids at the park. Then be happy to get my alone time back at home lol. Over summer I would also go to camp. I grew up in a complex that was gated, so allowed to play on my own outside where I met other kids who I would hang out with. And once I started school I was all good. I made friends fine and stayed over at their house or mine. \n\nReally, an only child really gets used to the independence and entertaining themselves without the pressure of being forced to \u201cplay\u201d aka with other siblings. So I feel just being brought to places where I could make a choice helped. Sometimes at the playground I would just read with my mom there, other times I played tag with the other kids.
