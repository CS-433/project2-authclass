Try something else. Learn from your mistakes.\n* Think of any concept as being either \"you don't know\" or \"you don't know yet\", never \"you can't do it\". That means also to read the description. Then read a description for the parts of the description that you don't fully understand. Go as deep as you need until it's clear. You can basically google anything.\n* Always read the documentation of functions or classes that you're going to use. So you know why they work as they do and what's the thought behind it. Google anything you don't understand.\n* Look at example code / projects that do exactly what you want to do and try to figure out exactly how they do it. Then copy it, but not CTRL-C + V, instead rewrite it by yourself.\n* If you're a complete beginner - do an introductory Python or Java course. It's always easier to learn a new language, because algorithms are essentially the same most of the time. \n\nMy journey with Godot, as I mentioned on here, was just a day of trying around and employing those methods listed above. Nothing special. Mario pixel art and sound effects can be found online, the animations were pretty easy to figure out by playing the game in an emulator.\n\nThe only problems I encounter are with the engine's UI itself. It doesn't come near modern feature-rich IDE's I use elsewhere. And for example, if I select an animation, it sets all actual values to this animation and I have to reset them manually. But I'm still learning.\n\nMy one friend I showed it, said \"sweet\", my wife thought it was funny, that's about the peer feedback I got so far :)\n\nI will try to finish it and create a dedicated level editor to build my own mario levels and publish the whole thing on GitHub later.
