I want to get to speaking as quickly as possible, but the format of searching is so time-consuming. I sometimes use \"My Topics\" like HelloTalk's Moments feature, but it never results in more conversations. With Tandem, even as a Premium user, I never reached my speaking goals. The time and effort required is too much.\n\nI do like their search feature for \"Find members or topics\". However, I've noticed that it only searches keywords on their Topics, and NOT from their sections \"I like to talk about\", \"My perfect Tandem partner is\", or \"My language learning goals are\". I think if they improved the search, I would use it more to discover people whose interest I want to talk about. I also like to listen to my transcripts like HelloTalk provides. But I don't think Tandem records these or makes them easily accessible.\n\nIt sounds like you have plenty of time on your hands and don't mind the effort of searching and messaging many profiles. Once you do get someone on the horn, don't they have a feature that divides the time in half automatically? If not, just set boundaries up front that you intend to split the conversation equally.

I got frustrated trying to find language partners on apps like HelloTalk and Tandem. I had to search hundreds of profiles, message a bunch of people or post publicly for availability, and then juggle all that while trying to get someone on an audio or video call (did I mention time zone coordination?). But even if I managed to get a language partner, the call was always an exchange, so I only got to practice speaking my target language 50% of the time. If you're squeezed for time like me, you know this process is no bueno.\n\nOne day I was driving home with 30 minutes to spare. I thought to myself: how cool would it be if I could  just say out loud, \"Hey Siri, call a native Spanish speaker\", and then be connected with a real life native Spanish speaker! Well, I built a prototype and tested it with Mexican Spanish speakers learning English, and American English speakers learning Spanish. Now the product is ready for early adopters and beta testers. I think it could be a great solution for language learners who are blind too because the interface is an automated voice system that recognizes voice input. There is no mobile app to install. You just need a phone that can also send and receive text messages.\n\nI'm looking for enthusiastic Spanish learners who would allow me to observe or record them using this language partner phone service. I believe it is currently accessible with voice input, but I would prefer to see how you use the product so I can fix any annoying bugs, or maybe I didn't think about a particular scenario, or whatever the case may be.
