barrier where norwegians are shy/uncomfortable being open in english. they are private people to begin with, but even more so if it's in english. \n\n\n\n\u2022 really, really, really get to know the public transport bc it is chaotic and sometimes annoying as fuck. you go a little bit out of the center and suddenly it takes you 1 hour and 4 busses to reach a destination that's the same time walking. it makes it difficult to live outside of central area (for e.g., i work night shifts so that's especially not viable for me) but central area is expensive. weigh pros and cons for yourself here. \n\n\n\n\u2022 check out student associations in each town and note which one has associations you are most drawn to. that's the way i made friends and i think its the easiest way for a social life here as a foreigner.\n\n\n\n\u2022 consider if you are a small town or big city person. oslo is not a \"big city\" anyway to begin with but it has significantly bigger center and more lively than other towns. i wouldn't say i myself am a \"big city\" person in any way, and oslo is perfect for me: it has its cultural life, events, clubs in the center and if you go a little bit outside, it's peace and nature. whereas when i visited bergen it was basically all peace and nature. the center is 1-2 relatively small streets. \n\n\n\n\u2022 i come from southeastern europe and everyone was warning me about the cold and the darkness. but no one warned me how fucking light summers get. granted, you have more energy, but i couldn't really sleep or chill bc of it lol. i'm more of a night/cold type of person so winter here has worked better for me than the summer (for now). most notably, in winter in oslo you get 4 hours of solid light. in summer, you get about 2 hours of kinda dark-ish. \n\n\n\n\u2022 shit's expensive but there's ways around that. get acquainted with all money saving apps finn, mattilbud, supermarkets memberships, too good to go, tise, bookis, etc. \n\n\n\n\u2022 bureaucracy is very not immigrant friendly so take that into account and come with a bunch of savings in place to get you through the first months while you sort out the shitshow that is getting a police registration, personal number, a tax card, address registration, post registration and bank account in place. having student status is a massive advantage, but still. and if you fall into one of the numerous immigration bureaucratic loopholes, contact your university and really insist that they help you (happened to me, i ended up writing a very dramatic e-mail but then university sorted out my problem). once you have all the bureaucracy sorted, life in norway is next level easy and very comfortable, but the initial months are documentation hell.", "created_utc":
