But to a large extent, the problems are otherwise similar regardless of the language.\n\nI don't study Japanese, but for my Russian studies, over the years, I've steadily added fewer and fewer vocabulary cards and focused much more attention of _application_ - what phrase to use here? In what grammatical forms? And I just prefer to consume more information in my target language outside of Anki. Of course, if I run across a word I don't know, I head over to Anki to make sure it goes into my decks for long-term retention.\n\nI don't know how your decks are structured, but possibly a wider variety of card types, with more emphasis on using the vocabulary in more-or-less real world settings would help with the context-dependency problem.", "created_utc": "1664832327.0", "edited": "False", "id": "iqxqa12", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_xuinxj", "parent_id": "t3_xuinxj", "score": "2", "subreddit": "Anki", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s9lm"}, {"author": "OjisanSeiuchi", "body": "Browser \u2192 select all cards in that deck \u2192 Cards menu > Forget.

You have an overabundance of nitrogen in the system; so removing carbon will further distort the balance. Eggshells - OK to leave or remove. Not much happens with eggshells unless pulverized.\n\n> 3. ...How can I unclog the floor without upsetting the worms?\n\nIt's OK to periodically fluff things up. Not daily. But occasionally, the worms will tolerate it fine.\n\n> 4. In general, does my little farm look healthy here?\n\nHard to say entirely at this distance. But if the smell is OK and they are processing the food and there's little or now drainage, you are probably OK. As mentioned, it looks overfed is the only thing I'd comment on. Also, they will go through the foods faster if you reduce the particle size somewhat. For some foods - banana peels, watermelon, pumpkin, etc. this isn't strictly necessary because they are such favoured foods. But for less favoured foods, you can increase the consumption rate by chopping a bit, (or pre-freezing/thawing, or both.)\n\n> 5. When should I spray with water or add ice?\n\nYour bind seems humid enough if there's condensate on the lid and walls. Ice? I've never added, but I live in Canada and my systems stay in the basement. But apparently I've heard 90F+ is getting into the danger zone for E. fetida.\n\n> 6. When should I add more food?\n\nWhen the last batch is mostly/completely processed.\n\n> 7. Because nothing has drained for a month (this farms life time), would my worms' health be impacted currently?\n\nNope. Seems OK to me.

To be honest, it's a bit of a judgement call. I do use a stackable tray system and I take into consideration the proportion of castings to residual bedding and the density of the worm population in the bin.

Eventually. Even if you are feeding only in the new bin above, enough worms will remain behind to consume the bedding in the old bin.\n\nI will say that one of the mistakes I've made is to leave the castings in place too long before harvesting the bin. The result is very dense, wet, sticky material that is hard to manage. It has been suggested that this is the result of repeat cycles of re-consumption of the material by the worms.

I'm happy to describe it further, exhibit some sample code, etc. Unfortunately, a lot of these sorts of workflow solutions are specific to one's own specific needs; so it's hard to just pick it up and port it over to someone else's setup.\n\nHere's a [post that I wrote-up](https://www.ojisanseiuchi.com/2022/06/02/a-tool-for-scraping-definitions-of-russian-words-from-wikitionary/) that describes one component of the process.", "created_utc": "1661770869.0", "edited": "False", "id": "im8pd5x", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_x0kpb4", "parent_id": "t3_x0kpb4", "score": "2", "subreddit": "Anki", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s9lm"}, {"author": "OjisanSeiuchi", "body": "Going out on a limb here with some assumptions:\n\n1.

Assuming the color-coding is being applied using the color formatting button in the editor tools (which creates `<span>` elements in the field HTML.\n3. Assuming that it's safe to remove **all** span-based color, other than that provided in the cloze token itself.\n\nIf that's true, then you can do this with a script on the card. Since I don't know exactly what your card template looks like, I'll just show you an example that you can adapt. This would be for the front template:\n\n```\n<div class=\"container\">\n   <div id=\"front-sentence\">\n      {{cloze:Text}}\n   </div>\n</div>\n\n<script>\nfunction removeSpansColor() {\t\n   let cloze_el = document.querySelector(\"#front-sentence\");\n   Array.from(cloze_el.querySelectorAll('span')).forEach((el) => {\n      // ignore the cloze span itself\n      // so that the existing styling is still applied\n      // otherwise remove any styling\n      if (el.class != \"cloze\") {\n         el.removeAttribute(\"style\");\n      }\n   });\n}\n\nif (document.readyState !== 'loading') {\n   removeSpansColor();\n} else {\n   document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', removeSpansColor);\n}\n\n</script>\n```\n\nHow does this work? Essentially, we wait for the card to finish loading, then look for all the `<span>` that exist within the element identified as `front-sentence`. We ignore those spans that have the class _cloze_ because that's provided by Anki itself. But all of the other spans we're going to remove the styling attribute from them.\n\nNotes:\n\n- This is only on the front. The back template is business-as-usual.\n- Your template probably looks different. To make the script work as-is, you will need to wrap your cloze in a `<div id=\"front-sentence\">` as I've done above, or adapt the JavaScript accordingly.\n- This is a fairly blunt instrument.

I'm not sure that you will be able to do *all* of this in CSS alone. (For example, how to identify that a verb is subjunctive tense.) As a rule, changes in the presentation that are dynamically affected by content, are going to require some JavaScript. Unless you want to hand-edit your field HTML, which sounds tedious.\n2. The DRY principle for CSS here is straightforward. Let's say you want a consistent colour palette across note types, you can create a file with CSS variables, store it in `collection.media` with an underscore prefix to prevent Anki from trying to delete it. Then you can import it where needed.\n\nHere's part of my `_anki_colours.css`:\n\n    :root {\n       --solarized-base-00: #657b83;\n       --solarized-base-01: #586e75;\n       --solarized-base-02: #073642;\n       --solarized-base-03: #002b36;\n       --solarized-base-0:  #839496;\n       --solarized-base-1:  #93a1a1;\n       --solarized-base-2:  #eee8d5;\n       --solarized-base-3:  #fdf6e3;\n       --solarized-red:     #dc322f;\n       --solarized-orange:  #cb4b16;\n       --solarized-magenta: #d33682;\n       --solarized-violet:  #6c71c4;\n       --solarized-cyan:    #2aa198;\n       --solarized-green:   #859900;\n       --solarized-yellow:  #b58900;\n       --solarized-blue:    #268bd2;\n    \n       /* \n          the following are not part of the solarized spec\n          but are useful shardes of existing colours\n       */\n    \n       /* this is a lighter shade of solarized-base-1 */\n       --solarized-base-20: #b3bdbd;\n    }\n\nAnd in the styling for each note type:\n\n    @import url(\"_anki_colours.css\");\n\nI do this for fonts, and other reusable elements. You can also use the add-on Closet but that ended up making my note templates appear too bloated when I would go to edit them.\n\nAnyway, if you're looking for consistency across note types, this is how I do it. If you want to change a colour, changing it in the centralized CSS file will be reflected across all.\n\nEDIT: Just wanted to clarify. My point #1 above. For example, you want a Python logo on the Python deck. The template offers the `{{Deck}}` tag, but something on the template has to be able to recognize that the content is _\"Python\"_.

For example, in Russian, the dictionary form of \"dog\" is *\u0441\u043e\u0431\u0430\u043a\u0430*, but there are six nominal cases in Russian, so do I look for only *\u0441\u043e\u0431\u0430\u043a\u0430*, or do I look for *\u0441\u043e\u0431\u0430\u043a\u0443*, *\u0441\u043e\u0431\u0430\u043a*, *\u0441\u043e\u0431\u0430\u043a\u043e\u0439*, *\u0441\u043e\u0431\u0430\u043a\u0430\u043c\u0438*, etc.? In other words, part of what you would have to do is to look through  all of the source material, reduce the sentences to their base forms (lemmas) and decide whether it's a candidate or not. That would be an enormously time-intensive process. Or you could generate all of the inflected forms then sequentially go out and look for those forms. That would be a little more efficient. Even in a trivially-inflected language like English, it's an issue that would have to be dealt with.\n2. **Source material** \\- Tatoeba has an API (application programming interface) that one can use. However, it doesn't permit embedding in a web page. Unfortunately that include an Anki card. There is a guy who has an open-source project that provides a proxy server for Tatoeba that *can* be used. Tatoeba is by no means comprehensive and if it's not suitable, you'd have to think about what other sources (per-language) are suitable and deep enough for mining.\n\nNot sure where you want to go with this.

It has taken me *years* to get to a C1 level in Russian.\n\n>Could you share any recommendations?\n\nSure, focus more on sentences. The grammar is very difficult; if you try to learn the grammar by tables, you're doomed. I mean, the genitive plural case alone is madness. Instead, find sentences for every word you're learning. [OpenRussian](https://en.openrussian.org) is great for that. Put *those* in Anki as cloze-deletion sentences. Better to learn grammar by *pattern* than by *rule*. Gradually, you will develop a \"6th sense\" about how to use words in their correct for, even if you can't say the rule.\n\nSame for vocabulary.

Seriously, enjoy the process. It's a rich and beautiful language. Random pieces of advice follow:\n\nLearn the alphabet and pronunciation first out-of-the-gate.\n\n- **Textbook choice** - the _New Penguin Russian Course_ book is often recommended. It's excellent. Work through that as your introduction to the language - maybe even A2 or so.\n- **Duolingo** - fine, but don't rely on it as a sole resource. Much of it strikes me as unserious, gamified, and stilted.\n- **Pronunciation** - don't allow yourself to develop poor pronunciation at the beginning. There are tons of resources for pronunciation on YouTube. Listen super-carefully for differences between hard and soft consonants, for example\n- **Grammar** - Russian grammar is complex and deep. Pay attention but don't get hung-up on it. In particular, don't memorize tables. Learn to _apply_ the tables. For example, gallons of ink have been spilled explaining the rules for the genitive plural. I couldn't even begin to tell you all the rules. Better to perceive and practice _patterns_.\n- **Consume media** - at the beginning it will hard to find media at the level you are at. But by the time you finish your first text, you'll be ready to start listening to podcasts. My favourites are Russian with Max, and Russian Dacha Club.\n- Install a Russian keyboard on your computer's OS.\n- Since this your first foray into language-learning:\n   - Be consistent.\n   - Use Anki spaced repetition software to build and maintain your vocabulary. Learn a word or new expression? Put it in Anki. But don't learn a bunch of words that you haven't encountered in real life. You need context to make it stick.\n   - Practice spoke language with a native speaker.\n   - Be patient with yourself. Lots of people give up because they are unrealistic about the time it takes. \n   - Ask questions. Folks here are extremely helpful, especially if you disclose that a) you've made some effort on your own first, and b) that you're a neophyte. \n\nThere are certainly hundreds and hundreds of other resources we could share; but at this point, the most important is to set a good foundation.\n\nWe really live in a Golden Age for language learners - so many resources.

I do have cards that lapse enough to meet the leech threshold but I just have Anki tag them and not suspend them. Periodically I go through the cards with `tag:leech` and look at what I can do to either refactor them or add additional cards that reinforce my knowledge around the thing that I keep lapsing. That done, I remove the `leech` tag and move on. It might lapse again, it might not.

There is a risk of over-thinking and over-planning all of this. As a long-term Anki user and a maintainer of my own growing Zettelkasten, I think I understand where you are coming from. I suspect, that our goals may be different - I finished university nearly 40 years ago. Anki didn't exist. Personal computers were barely useable. Life was simpler in one sense. \n\nHere's how I divide up my knowledge management:\n\n- **Anki** - strictly for language study. Very little of the content that goes into Anki is conceptual, _unless I can exemplify it in some concrete applicable way_. \n- **Zettelkasten** - I use DEVONthink to implement my ZK, but the choice of technology is really unimportant here. I do take lots of notes on different subjects (including the topic of languages that ends up in Anki).\n- **Link repository** - I use a self-hosted instance of [Espial](https://github.com/jonschoning/espial), but again the technology is unimportant. I mention this only because one of the philosophies of the Zettelkasten is to avoid the [collector's fallacy](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/collectors-fallacy/) where just by saving something you think you know it.

There's something about \"manually\" moving these thoughts around that is necessary and reinforcing.\n\nI suppose I'd summarize it by saying that I use Anki for very concrete applications of the knowledge that may also be found in my ZK.

My [learning steps](https://docs.ankiweb.net/deck-options.html?highlight=learning%20steps#learning-steps) go out to a month now for most decks.

The ease factor begins to decay, putting the card at risk for \"Ease Hell.\"\n2.

You'll probably do more as the momentum of the work propels you forward.\n- Use the **Pomodoro Method**. That is, work in structured on-off periods with enforced and predictable breaks.\n- **Block out everything else** when you should be doing reviews. Depending on what platform you're on, there are ways of blocking access to designated distractors.\n- **Create rules for yourself**, e.g. \"I will not look at Reddit/social media/email until I've done at least 100 reviews.\"\n- **Take pride in your decks.** Make your cards look aesthetically pleasing so that you're not spending your time staring at the Anki equivalent of Brutalist architecture.\n- **Practice habit-chaining** - are there other things that you do reliably?

But after that, I make a new card and go to town.\n\n> I have cards that i have created almost one year ago and I seem to hit that again button more times that I should.\n\nMaybe the temporal gap between creation and studying is an issue? Otherwise, my approach to cards that fail a lot is to make additional cards that cover the same material from a different angle. So a word that I don't recall, I may make one or two more sentence cards so I building a stronger context around the forgotten word.

The simplest might be to change the order of the fields, so that the add-on (assuming it works the way I think it does...) doesn't see the duplicates.\n\nIn my opinion, the better option is to create a new unique identifier field for each card type. This can be done automatically with the [Ze Add Note Id](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/886709118) add-on. It adds a unique identifier automatically and if that's the first field in the field list, then you will never have duplicates. That's because the unique id becomes the note id which is the millisecond-level timestamp of the note's creation date.\n\n_However_, I could be wrong - maybe the underlying workflow in your case doesn't work that way, but this is what I do to achieve uniqueness (and allow duplicates, therefore.)\n\nEDIT: For reference, here's what my note editor looks like with this in-place: https://imgur.com/a/K2bwvi1\n\nEDIT: I thought about this again, the problem will be that you still won't have unique id's on the old existing pre-made cards.

Cards begin as `new` cards. Once a card is shown to you once, it's now in `learning` status.

When you pass through the last \"gate\" successfully, the card graduates to `review` status and the graduating interval is applied as the initial interval. Of course, if you fail any of the learning steps, you restart the process.\n\nSo on the card you are describing:\n\n- `Again 20m` - that's obvious, if you fail the card, you restart the learning queue.\n- `Good 6d` - apparently you are on the last learning interval which is 6d. \n- `Easy 5d` - because your Easy interval setting is 5d.\n- `Hard 5d` - is because the hard interval is calculated to be between the `Again` and `Good` intervals. You can't set the `Hard` interval explicitly; it is computed by the algorithm.\n\nIn fact, once a card goes into review, all of the intervals are computed based on how the SRS algorithm evaluates your memory performance on that card.

In fact, you can have many different cards that are created from a single note. If this is for foreign language study, it could be L1 \u2192 L2, _and_ L1 \u2192 L2, _and_ L2 definition \u2192 L2 word, _and_ image \u2192 L2 words, etc. etc. I have a note type that builds 6-7 different card types. The sky's the limit!\n\nDescribing how to add a card type is a little beyond the scope of what I can do in a post here.

In language-learning, I think it's always helpful to push yourself toward larger units of language - phrases, sentences. But it can be tricky to memorize and reproduce full sentences prompted by the L1 text. With reasonably complicated sentences, synonyms, variable word order, etc. come into play. Maybe that's not such a big problem, but you should anticipate it.\n\nPerhaps it helps to think of sentences in two ways. One group is comprised of sentences that you just memorize whole for rapid production, e.g. _Quelle heure est-il?_ But another group is comprised of models for grammatical constructs, clauses, and other reusable components that you'll use in your own sentences in real life.

I do not use pre-built decks. I've tried. For one reason or another, I disliked all that I tried - either for aesthetic reasons, or errors, or just choices in the presentation of material that I disagreed with for pedagogical reasons. But mostly my objection to prebuilt decks is related to the fact that the source material is chosen for you. Instead, what goes into your decks should reflect what you are learning outside of Anki through your studies, consumption of media, reading, conversations, assignments, etc.\n\nThat said, some people like to use pre-built decks because it reduces the time spent making cards. While it is true that you end up spending more time studying that way, not all of the time spent making cards is wasted. You're still interacting with material in the language after all.\n\nSo TL;DR my 32,000 cards are ones that I've made. I should also say that my decks are all Russian, not Japanese, so maybe the overall quality of pre-built decks is better for Japanese than Russian. Not sure. In any case, you are still constrained by the visual design and information design choices that the creator made. That could be OK, or it could be bad, depending...\n\nOr if you are just starting out, maybe a prebuilt deck is OK to get the rudiments of the language. Then shift to custom cards once your ability to consume information in Japanese grows. Lots of ways to slice this!\n\nMore important than the pre-built vs self-created question is the nature of the content and whether it fits with good learning practices. A strong emphasis on sentences vs. isolated words is critical because we think and communicate in units of language that are larger than single words. I've made very heavy use of cloze deletion sentences for this reason. I still have many many vocabulary words, but in almost every case, any word is also paired with one of more example sentences that I'm tested on.\n\nThis may be way more than you need at this stage, but I recently started writing up my experience with Anki for language learning. While it does have a heavy focus on how I've leveraged certain technologies to make cards faster, maybe something will catch your eye.

You didn't say what your deck settings are but I surmise your learning steps are 1m 10m and a graduating interval of 1d (the default settings). That means when you see a card the first time, it will return approximately one minute later.  When it returns if you score it `Good`, it will return in approximately 10m. When it returns at 10m, if you score it `Good` again, the card will now graduate to the review status and the graduating interval will be applied. If the graduating interval is 1d which I surmise it is, then that's the approximate time you will see the card again.\n\nIf you haven't read the [Anki manual](https://docs.ankiweb.net) I would encourage you to read at least the Intro, Getting Started, and Studying sections because it really will help familiarize you with the underlying concepts and nomenclature that the software uses.

That's the most important piece of advice I can give you. Anything else is magic. So, I look at the stats provided by Anki (and those provided through add-ons) to do that. The computation used to adjust the interval modifier is noted in the Anki manual. I use that to make serial adjustments. Just a caveat, make small adjustments, infrequently. With large adjustments in the interval modifier, I have found that I get into oscillations of overshooting, then undershooting the desired performance. Once a month, small adjustments. Put it on your calendar - check your stats, small adjustments.\n\nI'm sorry I can't remember any longer what the default settings are. I seem to recall that the default starting ease puts you too close to the \"ease hell\" threshold, so mine is 250. There's also a methodology that involves ascertaining the average mature card ease and using that as the base for the starting ease. \n\nI believe that the default learning steps are very compact. This seems to contribute to poor learning and the risk of lapsing into ease hell. That's why I migrated to long learning intervals a few years ago. Mine are: `5m 10m 15m 4h 36h 7d 30d` with a graduating interval of 30d. Difficult cards end up bounding around in the learning clue longer than otherwise, but by the time they exit, I know them better and the chances of lapsing are less.\n\nI also use the add-on [Straight Reward](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/957961234), to reinforce the ease factor, so that I'm not penalized for lapses _disproportionately to successes_.\n\n> how others manage with their AGAIN HARD GOOD EASY buttons\n\nIf I don't know it \u2192 `Again`.

The other camp are the people who like to keep fastidious control over their format and allow their card templates to do all the formatting.\n\nThe reason for the incessant `&nbsp` is that if you've purposely or accidentally pasted HTML content into your field, Anki is going to start adding `&nbsp`. But the good news is that it only happens when there's already HTML so if you can just avoid that problem (my perspective is leaking here...) in the first place, you won't have those pesky `&nbsp`.\n\nThere are a couple ways to accomplish that. First Anki provides a means of pasting without formatting. In my hands on 2.1.49 macOS, it's 50/50. Since I never, ever, ever, ever want someone else's HTML in my fields, I was forced to develop a workaround that completely guarantees what gets pasted is plaintext.

If the field is empty, then it becomes a standard cloze, if it's non-empty, it's a grammar card, etc. etc. Here's an example of this sort of branching in use in my template:\n\n```\n{{#@grammar_card}}\n   <!-- instructions -->\n\n   {{#@grammar_card_instructions}}\n      {{@grammar_card_instructions}}\n   {{/@grammar_card_instructions}}\n{{/@grammar_card}}\n```\n\nIn this way, I've been able to maintain the flexibility that multiple note types affords but without the burden of maintenance when I want to change the format or the behaviour of an embedded script.\n\nDoes this make sense?", "created_utc": "1653993178.0", "edited": "1653993360.0", "id": "ianbe83", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_v0xp8h", "parent_id": "t3_v0xp8h", "score": "2", "subreddit": "Anki", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s9lm"}, {"author": "OjisanSeiuchi", "body": "If you really want to create a frequency deck and no frequency lists are available in the target language, the missing piece is a software concordancer.

Group 3 is what you would want to concentrate on.\n\nFor me the most time-consuming part of this is collecting these Group 3 words, so I wrote a tool - a sort of concordancer -  that scans a text word-by-word and looks for whether each word is in my Anki db or not; if not, the word gets added to a list.

Instead, I've just tried to get Zen about it and commit myself to working down the backlog. I setup a spreadsheet that I used to keep track of the backlog and to compute how many cards I needed to review daily to finish by a certain date. The data-driven approach to getting back on track helped me commit to the task. It took me about as long to recover as the duration of the period I was away from Anki - maybe a little longer.\n\nGeneral advice, don't add any new cards while you're catching up. There are approaches that involve filtered decks to capture really overdue cards and keep them separate from cards that are just coming due now. I've never applied that approach, but others here have vouched for the method.\n\n>Any other way to find back some motivation ?\n\nMore of life-advice here, but any way that you can connect the work to some deeply-held value will help overcome the hurdle.

The role of the sentence decks is two-fold: 1) to be able to produce and recognize words in larger units of language and 2) to reinforce grammar patterns. Do I have any grammar decks? Yes, but few. Mostly, I'll create a grammar-specific deck around narrow grammar issues that I'm working on, e.g. Russian participles.\n\n>How can I set up grammar questions because I basically know nothing about the grammar of course\n\nThe best way to learn grammar is through usage. Find sentences that use grammar concepts that you are working on and use cloze-deletion cards to test yourself on it. Grammar tables are fine, but don't test yourself on them in Anki. Language needs to be learned, consumed and produced in larger meaning-centred units.\n\n>where can I possibly find good vocabulary to learn?\n\nSources of vocabulary? Everywhere! The best source of vocabulary comes from what you're learning outside of Anki.  My tutor mentions a word I don't know \u2192 I write it down and put it in Anki. I read a word I don't know, again into Anki. Find sentences that use this word. Add those cards too.\n\nMy own personal word of advice about pre-made decks for language learning - avoid. It's disembodied knowledge that has no relevance to what you - a unique individual, with unique experiences and needs - are encountering. Maybe for the first 100-500 most common words, just to get started, a pre-made deck is OK; but move as quickly as possible to bringing in your own content.", "created_utc": "1625045828.0", "edited": "False", "id": "h3jjric", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_oaenkx", "parent_id": "t3_oaenkx", "score": "4", "subreddit": "Anki", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s9lm"}, {"author": "OjisanSeiuchi", "body": "I looked at that deck. I can only guess at what the commenters mean by \"configuring the cards.\" \n\nPossibly they mean styling the cards, because there's been no attempt to apply any visual hierarchy or aesthetics to the cards. Partly a matter of taste; partly a question of good information design practices.\n\nMore likely, they mean this:  Right now the deck provides one card type En \u2192 Ru. One can imagine a Ru \u2192 En card type being added. Or a card type that tests the example sentences specifically. Or a card types where you have to match up imperfective and perfective forms. There's a lot there - the deck has potential - but I think you'd have to define your goals before talking about customization.\n\nPersonally, I'd look at that deck as a data source that you could creatively work from.   \n(One nit-picking item: the *declension\\_html* field is misnamed.
