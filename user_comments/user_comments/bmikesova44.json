You cannot convince me that her feet were all sliced up and then she walked completely fine the next day and even was filmed dancing ballet a couple of days later. No chance. Furthermore, there are so many times I would expect to see photos of her injuries. Not because every victim should have them (I myself have none of any of the abuse I suffered), but she was literally taking photos all the time. Why did she take a photo of writing on the mirror, but not of herself? Her feet? Why did she take a photo of a 'broken' bed, but not the bloody pillow?

Even if you are sedentary, you need to eat enough to get all your nutrients in. \n\nAlso, it is VERY difficult to keep hunger away on so little food. To successfully lose weight, you need to be in a calorie deficit. However, it cannot be so big that you are constantly hungry, tired and overall miserable - because you know what? Eventually you\u2019ll be fed up, give into your hunger (and rightly so) and maybe even get into a never ending binge-restrict cycle. \n\nLastly, you are 191lbs. To successfully lose weight and maintain it long term, you need to learn how to eat a healthy, balanced diet - and you can\u2019t do that on 800-1000 calories a day. At such a high weight, you would be much better off starting slowly - learn about portion size, hunger and fullness cues. Learn about basic nutrition, make some super fun healthy meals. Once you have that under your belt, then you can start worrying about maybe counting calories. \n\nRemember, you do NOT need to be in a 1000 calorie deficit to lose weight. A smaller deficit will also get you to your goal - and you will probably enjoy the journey a bit more. \ud83d\ude42", "created_utc": "1635540321.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hik78uw", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_qilnvf", "parent_id": "t3_qilnvf", "score": "24", "subreddit": "PetiteFitness", "subreddit_id": "t5_2nlfzf"}, {"author": "bmikesova44", "body": "Oh absolutely!

Might be a bit of a long read though. \n\nFor a bit fo context, my problems with food started when I was as young as 10, when I hit puberty and I got a lot of my family members commenting on my weight. I started dieting and got into a really unhealthy mindset, where I was starving myself, always hungry... I remember counting calories and having a breakdown when I got over my 1000cal limit by eating way too many carrots... yeah. I also started running A LOT. As you can imagine, it was unsustainable and soon enough, my body started fighting back and I began to binge eat every day (I would eat pretty much anything, the weirdest things really). Since then, I was in a constant cycle of restricting and then absolutely not caring about what and how much I ate - during those times, I would usually eat a lot of junk food and not much else. So, I slowly gained a lot of weight and the highest I was was almost 160lbs at 5ft1. \n\nA year ago, basically as lockdown started in the UK, I got into the 'omg I am so fat and need to lose this weight straight away' mode again. So, I started counting calories again, for like the 500th time and decided to give myself 1000cal limit again. I don't know why I kept on doing that, but I just thought that's what I... had to do? It was something that stuck with me from my teen years I think (I'm 21 now). I was so sedentary that 1000 calories a day felt pretty alright for a while. But, then I picked up running again and of course I found myself hungrier and hungrier. (Also I lost 20lbs in the first couple months alone... not very healthy) \n\nWell, I started binge eating a few months into losing weight again, but it wasn't as bad at first and I managed to mostly stop myself from doing so by basically allowing myself to FINALLY eat more (1400 calories or so). But honestly? It didn't improve my relationship with food much at all. I started getting pretty obsessive about counting calories again and any sort of times when I couldn't count them would cause me SO MUCH STRESS. I was still very uncomfortable in my body and pretty much constantly picked apart everything about myself. \n\nIn August I got down to about 110ish pounds and travelled to my home country to see my family. During this time, I pretty much stuck to my diet, but I didn't count or weight anything. However, I still had so much control for the whole month I was there. \n\nBut god, all hell broke lose when I got back. When I got back to the UK, I weighed around 105 lbs and I just felt so tired of dieting and counting calories etc. I decided to finally try to maintain. However, I still maintained this rigid control over food and I was always questioning every single piece of food I put into my mouth. Should I be eating this? Is this too much? Am I going to gain weight? Food and exercise (I started to lift weights at this time) was pretty much all I thought about. This mental restriction and obsession is basically what sent me down this months long binge spiral and I didn't get out of until December. I would, no joke, binge evry single day for weeks at a time on anything I could. I felt horrible, sick and I had no control over my eating whatsoever. It was HORRIBLE. I knew that starving myself after every binge wouldn't be a good idea, so I didn't. But, I was still always thinking about food and what I had done to myself. \n\n**So, how did I get from that point to where I am now?** Well, it's many things really. First, I stopped using exercise as a way to simply burn calories, but rather to feel mentally good, to feel strong and to basically see how much my body can achieve. I use it to empower me. Because I want to get stronger, I started shifting my focus in my eating as well. To grow muscle, I need protein and since I am vegetarian (almost vegan though), I really need to think about protein to get a good amount. This shift in mindset from 'I can't eat a lot, I will get fat' to 'I need to eat enough of food so that I can grow stronger' has been one of the most important things that I could have done. Absolutely amazing. \n\nI also had to stop the dieting mindset. I was so afraid that if I gave myself a complete permission to eat whatever I wanted, I would just keep on binge eating and go absolutely crazy - but the truth is the exact opposite. When I removed that mental barrier, my brain sort of realized that food would always be available and that I didn't have to have it all straight away. Instead, I find myself eating 3 healthy meals and snacks, plus a few cookies or a couple of slices of pizza whenever I feel like it. I had to literally force myself to stop questioning my food choices all the time and simply find enjoyment in food though - otherwise it just wouldn't work. \n\nI gained 8 pounds or so in a couple of months of non-stop binge eating and it felt horrible. It took me a few more months to stop binging at all. But now I am at a place when I exercise because I love how it makes me feel, eat whatever I want, don't count calories and maintain a healthy 110lbs. :)", "created_utc": "1613075577.0", "edited": "False", "id": "gmzaum0", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_lhnfk8", "parent_id": "t1_gmywmr2", "score": "6", "subreddit": "loseit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rz8w"}, {"author": "bmikesova44", "body": "I came here to basically say this! \n\nA year ago I was 50lbs heavier (and I'm only 5ft 1, so that's a LOT of weight), ate McDonald's and all sorts of sugar every day and drank so much regular Coke.

I eat 3 full meals a day (unless I'm not hungry, or extra hungry...) and some snacks. Most of my meals come from whole food, but I still have some \"fun\" foods - funily enough, I just don't crave those ad much as I used to. I also workout about 5 times a week and walk a lot.

I usually have a bit of wholegreain bread on the side and rather than using a quarter cup of olive oil, I use just a tablespoon - works perfectly fine! \n\n[https://cookieandkate.com/vegetarian-chili-recipe/](https://cookieandkate.com/vegetarian-chili-recipe/) Love this chilli recipe. I usually serve it with a cup of brown rice and avocado, but you can just have it on it's own! \n\n[https://www.budgetbytes.com/mediterranean-white-bean-salad/](https://www.budgetbytes.com/mediterranean-white-bean-salad/) This one is great as well - I often meal prep it for lunches. I usually like to sub feta cheese for quinoa. :) \n\n[https://www.budgetbytes.com/balsamic-roasted-mushrooms/](https://www.budgetbytes.com/balsamic-roasted-mushrooms/) These are amazing with some roasted veggies and kale - or a vegan potato mash! \n\nI also make SO MANY tofu stir-fries or thai curries. With stir-fries I usually just marinate the tofu in a bit of soy sauce and some spices (garlic, chilli powder...) and then stir-fry it with some veggies that I feel like on that day (mangetout, courgette, mushrooms, edemame beans, peppers...). For curries I usually follow something like this recipe here [https://choosingchia.com/thai-red-coconut-curry-tofu/](https://choosingchia.com/thai-red-coconut-curry-tofu/)\n\nOh also tofu ramen is awesome! There are some really quick and easy recipes out there that you can try - [https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/vegan-ramen](https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/vegan-ramen). \n\n[https://www.lazycatkitchen.com/vegan-balsamic-mushroom-pasta/](https://www.lazycatkitchen.com/vegan-balsamic-mushroom-pasta/) You don't have to give up pasta to lose weight. I simply substitute it for chickpea pasta (or lentil when I feel like it) and probably eat it about 5 times a week. \n\nThese are just a couple of recipes that I think you should give a try. \n\nFor breakfast I make porridge, granola and yoghurt or when I feel like it a bit of veggie sausage and baked beans on toast! \n\nWith being vegan, I do think that you just sort of have to accept carbs as part of your life - however, that is not a bad thing! You say that you love white bread etc. - well start making substitutions for those. Find a type of wholemeal bread that you enjoy and include things like chickpea pasta, quinoa, oats, pearl barley, wholegrain noodles etc. I myself make sure to really focus on getting enough protein in my diet, as I currently only aim to maintain my weight loss and build muscle. Getting enough protein, combined with some healthy fats (I snack on nuts all the time, but portion size is really important!) and complex carbs is the key to staying satiated on a lower calorie diet. \n\nAt the end of the day though, it is all about calories in vs calories out. As a short woman, it can be a bit difficult sometimes, as we tend to burn less calories overall.

I also counted calories and only ate 1000-1200, which was rather stupid on my part! Well after that I started running 5x a week - I used to do it when I was younger and it really helped me get back into fitness again. Then I started adding in some bodyweight exercise at home as well, on top of running... while still undereating. I lost a lot of weight, but I also lacked energy and started binge eating. \n\nThen during August, I took over a month off - I had a breast reduction surgery and couldn't exercise for a long time and I also couldn't count calories since I was staying with my family at that time. However, that time off got me thinking quite a lot and I realized that I wanted to focus on getting stronger and eating more. I still counted calories though and I would binge on a weekly basis. Then I went through a phase when I would binge literally every day for like a month - so I gained a lot of weight and settled at around where I am now. I'm glad I did that though, because during this time I started doing proper resistence training at home with bands, dumb bells etc. and have put on a good amount of muscle. I just tend to do different challenges at home!  (also do karate 2x a week) \n\nNow I am slightly torn though, because I miss how small I used to be, but at the same time I don't want to cut.

How do I know? Because that's exactly what happened to me! \n\nI believe many women here underestimate how much they actually burn tbh. We get into this headspace of \"I'm short, therefore I can't lose weight unless I eat very little\", which just isn't true. When I started losing weight, I only ate 1000 and I was so paranoid that it took me a couple months to even allow myself to eat 1200.

However, we do have to be realistic - for most people, weight loss of 2lbs a week is tough, let alone for short women who aren't massively overweight either... we just don't burn as much during the day. It's perfectly fine to lose weight slowly. \n\nI remember when I started my weight loss, I also wanted to lose fast and I only ate 1200calories.

Not even working out, but just generally moving through the day, walking to places etc. You don't have to do anything extreme - I lost weight through walking, and then adding in about 30-45 minutes of exercise 4-5 days a week. It's really important to find something you like! \n\nAlso for short women, resistence training is really important. Muscle burns many more calories than fat and so the more you have the better, because then you burn more calories even during rest.
