I did the usual estrogen/progesterone mix first, when I was about 17 and just dead tired already of the sporadic and irregular periods and hormonal waves. At the time of starting the pill, I'd had a continuous period for 6 months. My mom was the one to decide to take me, since I was scared. That didn't work quite right; a while into the trial of those pills, one of my sugar pill weeks left me in absolute pain and cramping. Not to be tmi, but I had to pass/push out a literal *palm sized clot* to feel better. And no, I was not sexually active at the time, so it was just my body misbehaving. After that, my periods became irregular again, although my hormones were starting to get better.\n\n  My doctor then gave me another pill, progesterone only*, and told me to take it consistently with no week break. This was about a year later, after trying another estrogen/progesterone pill that also did nothing to reduce my problem. I've been taking this type ever since, and I guess because I don't give myself a week off, everything seems fairly regular and normal. No periods although I can tell when I *should* be having them (ie a bit moodier, more sensitive stomach, more discharge, acne flares). I don't feel much anxiety anymore, and my hormones feel pretty neutral and balanced. I'm usually a very easily stressed person but even when I'm stressed and anxious it's still mild. I don't have as many black hairs across my neck and chest, and while I'd like to say my weight hasn't altered much, I have actually noticed it's incredibly easy to gain weight but not lose it so far. I say this but I actually have been at somewhat of a \"neutral\" weight with little gain for the past 5 years now. I feel like my body won't let off the weight I gained when I wasn't active even though now I've been trying to eat healthier and exercise more. Oh well..\n\n  I have considered the risks of being on the continuous pill usage but I don't really have the money to afford an endocrinologist and gyno for testing, and this has seemed to keep my body in a pretty decent condition as far as I can tell, so it is what it is. Every body reacts differently however and nothing works for everyone! I hope this helped ease the anxiety a little bit.\n\n*Edit: she said it was mainly progesterone but I should correct and update to say it's not exactly the same, what I take is levonorgestrel 0.15mg and ethinylestradiol 0.03mg, so there is still a smaller dose of estrogen.

The fact that a lot of jobs are not like the States, where it's more of a permanent contract deal between you and the company (unless stated otherwise) is also reassuring and great. Prices for lots of food are the same about, sometimes cheaper sometimes not, but the quality is noticeably better. I used to believe the US was an alright country although shitty, and since moving, it's become even more of a depressing pit of sadness and overworked people to me. But my parents and older family members are vehement when I try to say that the country they grew up in isn't so grand. They very much believe in the \"if you don't do 40+ hours of job labor weekly you ain't shit\" mindset, but complain about how little they get to do in life, and how exhausted they are. I don't want that. Fuck the US' work standards.

However now I have found that the more I've immersed myself in listening, especially listening to French music with the lyrics on hand to read along, it's becoming more clearly. *Slowly* haha. I can definitely pick up more words per sentence and I've found that if I visualize the word in my head I can comprehend better as well.
