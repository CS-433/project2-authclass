I had asked E (34F), the woman I\u2019ve been dating for 2ish months if she could come over after my kid is asleep just for a little hang. She said she probably could. Just as I\u2019m getting kid into bed though she texted me saying she couldn\u2019t after all (without any other explanation) and wished me sweet dreams. \n\nThat sent me into a bit of a anxious spiral since I wasn\u2019t feeling like building the relationship was much of a priority for her. I\u2019m just about at the point where I\u2019m ready for this to be something more serious and she\u2019s not quite there yet which is fine but still am uncomfortable place for me to be in. So I had a cry and a grumpy day Saturday. I was already in a tender plwce and that just made it work. \n\nBUT then Saturday night E texts me apologizing. Apparently she had meant to send a second text giving context as to why she couldn\u2019t make it Friday and asking me out for next week. Which immediately made me feel better. PLUS i was able to share how I had been feeling and get some validation. Expressing my needs even when it\u2019s possibly conflict-inducing is *really* hard for me so I\u2019m really happy that I feel safe doing it in the dynamic E and I have. \n\nSo yeah, I\u2019m really happy with this dynamic. There might be a long-term incompatibility (I have a kid and don\u2019t want any more and E wants kids of her own but might be open to step parenting) but I\u2019m cautiously optimistic about where
