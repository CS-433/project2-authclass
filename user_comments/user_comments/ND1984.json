I can't easily understand and need to practice.\n\nMaybe I didn't learn this properly. in the first example, I thought I use 'mich' because it's the indirect pronoun like 'myself' in english or 'moi' (french, my first language). 'I make myself' or in french, 'Je me fais'.\n\nIn the second sentence, my first idea would be to say 'Ich fehlt noch ein Anzug', not 'Mir'.\n\nIs it actually that I should use 'mich' because there is the verb 'machen'? and in the second sentence, 'fehlt' takes the dative case ('Mir')? Is it 'Mir' because 'Anzug' is the subject (nominative) and the suit is missing 'from me'? \n\nSo in fact , perhaps I should first learn as many verbs as possible what cases they take before I try to make my own sentences?", "created_utc": "1666739259.0", "edited": "False", "id": "itscp9m", "is_submitter": "True", "link_id": "t3_yd9v15", "parent_id": "t1_its90yc", "score": "1", "subreddit": "German", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qq51"}, {"author": "ND1984", "body": "Glad they were identified!! they can have a proper burial and name to their grave.

They just try their best to talk and when they don't know a word they say it in Russian and someone else in the group you are speaking with will tell you how to say it in Ukrainian.

There are a lot of people who speak such strong surzhyk that it is really hard to say if they are speaking Ukrainian or Russian. So basically don't worry.
