The bigger problem is that in China, there is no social security system. Old people don't get money from the government to live off of once they can no longer work. Instead, they rely on their families to care for them in retirement. The problem is that girls, when they get married, permanently transfer over to their husband's family and take with them a good portion of their parents' stuff (i.e. a dowry, often a traditional expectation in marriage, as well as an insurance policy towards the bride's care in her husband's family). The parents are left high and dry as their daughter leaves their property with half their material belongings, never to return. Who will take care of the parents now? Good question. Compare this to having a son- the parents of a boy gain a family member when he grows up and  marries. Their son's wife is now obligated to take care of them, and they have access to the material wealth of their daughter-in-law's dowry. It isn't always the case that girl babies were killed or abandoned because they weren't wanted. Rather, their parents couldn't keep them because they were a huge liability (not to mention, everyone in this system living a whisker away from extreme poverty).\n\nChina's One Child Policy hasn't worked out too great for boys either.

Semmelweis, now revered as the father of antiseptic procedure, discovered that doctors that washed their hands in between conducting autopsies and delivering babies had a greatly reduced chance of passing deadly infection to the women in the delivery ward. He was resoundly mocked and ridiculed by the medical establishment, and died in an insane asylum. Andreas Vesalius was an anatomist who wrote one of the most influential books on anatomy. He corrected the works of Galen and Aristotle which, up to that point, were  dogmatically taught in the Medieval universities (Galen and Aristotle gained their anatomical knowledge from the study of animals, and used that to make assumptions about human anatomy). Vesalius faced ridicule for trying to forge his own theory based on direct observation of the human body. Antoine Lavoisier was extremely influential in the history of chemistry.

American. People are gonna downvote, because that's just what people on this platform do, but here's my reasoning: \n\nthe U.S. / German foreign policy relationship has been interesting from the start, and has had its ups and downs over the centuries. Things in modern times were looking up, generally, until the wiretapping scandal under Obama, which marked a huge breach of trust between the two countries, and its safe to say, things did not improve under Trump. oh God, did they not. Divisions range on issues including the NordStream pipeline, American military presence in Germany, and the size and role of Germany's military. As far as I know, Biden has not resolved these issues, and the political situation in the US only further drives a wedge. We have an embassy in Berlin, so I'm not worried about safety, but politically- we're united in support of Ukraine, but there's a way to go. \n\nnow \u00d6sterreich, I admit, is based on assumption. I really know gar nix about \u00d6sterreich. However, it does have a few relevant traits- very mountainous, rural, culturally reliant on transhumance, and sandwiched between several major European powers. In order to hold its own in such an environment, \u00d6sterreich has to stand up for itself, like a bulldog. However, being culturally herding-based, one can assume it is an \"honor\" culture (rather than a guilt or shame culture), a la the American South. There's nothing wrong with this, of course, but combining the cultural traits of Texas with the political traits of Ireland gives this American pause. If the US and Germany are having problems, one can imagine the US and \u00d6sterreich would be practically at each other's throats.", "created_utc": "1657836358.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ig6q1vj", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_vysnom", "parent_id": "t1_ig5qvim", "score": "1", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i"}, {"author": "Grey_Gryphon", "body": "Celery soda", "created_utc": "1657833994.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ig6k8cp", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_vyydau", "parent_id": "t3_vyydau", "score": "1", "subreddit": "AskAnAmerican", "subreddit_id": "t5_2uah7"}, {"author": "Grey_Gryphon", "body": "Oh, I was thinking more about politics than danger", "created_utc": "1657821291.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ig5n728", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_vysnom", "parent_id": "t1_ig51n8h", "score": "0", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i"}, {"author": "Grey_Gryphon", "body": "Germany.\nor \u00d6sterreich.", "created_utc": "1657806731.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ig4lo0c", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_vysnom", "parent_id": "t3_vysnom", "score": "0", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i"}, {"author": "Grey_Gryphon", "body": "Stalingrad", "created_utc": "1657806604.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ig4ldku", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_vyl1oo", "parent_id": "t3_vyl1oo", "score": "1", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i"}, {"author": "Grey_Gryphon", "body": "its very very similar, grammatically.

Wild animals need to have certain characteristic in order to be domesticated, but the people doing the domesticating also need to possess certain skills and/or certain resources in great enough abundance to support domestication.  Like many (most?) things scientific, it is possible if not likely that the truth lies somewhere in the middle- some animals are completely off limits to domestication due to certain factors related to physical characteristics, behavior, diet, or ease of keeping, but also that some human groups throughout history have lacked the necessary skills, behaviors, tools, or resources to domesticate native wild animals that could, in fact, be domesticated. There are relevant differences between reindeer and whitetail deer, but there are also relevant differences between the indigenous people of Arctic Scandinavia, and the indigenous people of the North American forests. Elands are native to Southern Africa, but were not domesticated by southern Africans (pdf link here:[https://www.wrsa.co.za/elands-intensive-husbandry-fattening-meat-quality-comparison-cattle/](https://www.wrsa.co.za/elands-intensive-husbandry-fattening-meat-quality-comparison-cattle/)). Indian people domesticated the gaur (native to India and Southeast Asia) , Asian people domesticated the water buffalo (native to the Asian swamplands), Anatolians domesticated the aurochs (native to Europe, Asia, Africa, and the Near East), indigenous North Americans never domesticated the bison (native to North America). Is this due to the differences between gaur, water buffalo, aurochs, and bison? Is this because of the differences between Indian, Asian, Anatolian, and North American people? is it a bit of both? \n\nAs for zebra, as far as I know, zebra do indeed have a social structure to their living groups. They group together in harems with a dominant stallion and mares and their offspring. The alpha mare is the group leader and mates first with the stallion (this is very much like the mustang herds of the American west, where the dominant stallion trails his family group for protection and for the possibility of capturing females from other groups, while the alpha female is the herd \"mother\" and dictates where they herd goes and when it stops). When a zebra stallion does capture a female from another family group (often after winning a fight with that group's dominant stallion), the new female is at the bottom of the pecking order of the new family group. This is also very similar to horses. Regardless, the basic fact that individual zebra have been tamed to ride and drive means there is/was a viable foundation stock of animals to selectively breed into domestication. Some might've taken to taming easier than others, or remembered their training better, or grew bigger on less food, or were quieter, or whatever. All natural variation in a tame population to exploit and amplify via selective breeding, If only Lord Rothschild and the other African colonial bigwigs had persisted. \n\nAs for elephants, it is possible that tens of thousands of years isn't enough time. Elephants are so big, slow-maturing, and intelligent, and domesticating them takes so many resources for such a long period of time for such sporadic returns that it makes much more sense economically to let nature gestate, feed, and birth them, and for humans to simply be \"poachers\" and take what they need from wild populations (its a bit like the apocryphal white elephants the king of Siam is said to have given to people he disliked- there was no appropriate way to get rid a gift from the king, and the animal ate its new owner into bankruptcy). Not to mention the incredible aggressiveness of male elephants in the breeding season. This is still a problem in modern-day India. It is interesting to note that while people in India have been taming and training wild elephants for thousands of years, the people of Africa have not. This may be explained by the natural differences between African and Asian elephants, but when Belgium colonized the Congo, they drew upon the expertise of Indian elephant trainers to successfully tame African elephants for work. \n\nthere are probably hard limits from the animal half of the domestication equation, but the human half of the equation gets too often overlooked and neglected.", "created_utc": "1651245328.0", "edited": "False", "id": "i6obgap", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_u4dxbm", "parent_id": "t1_i586uwo", "score": "1", "subreddit": "NoStupidQuestions", "subreddit_id": "t5_2w844"}, {"author": "Grey_Gryphon", "body": "ground turkey.

Domestic animals come from selectively breeding tame animals under human control, and any animal can be tamed and put under human control. Today's 14 domestic farm mammals have wild ancestors, as do today's wild animals, and it is human skill, patience, and resources that developed cattle from aurochs and sheep from mouflon. I don't think the reason why animals like zebras were never domesticated was necessarily because they didn't have \"the right stuff\". Zebras are nasty, vicious creatures, but so are Przewalski's horses. Humans made it work with one species, and failed with another. Deer are renowned for dying from the slightest amount of captivity-indued stress, and yet the Indigenous people of Finland domesticated reindeer. We domesticated cattle from aurochs (barely, according to this article: [https://www.wired.com/2012/03/cattle-ox-origins/](https://www.wired.com/2012/03/cattle-ox-origins/)), and yet, the indigenous people of North America failed to domesticate the bison. Ditto for mouflon and bighorn sheep. Heck, the people of India domesticated the Indian bison (also called a Gaur)- a creature capable of killing tigers- into the mithun. If we selectively bred the animals we tamed (like elephants in India, a challenge due to their 2 year gestation period) according to our desires (for docility, strength, a certain coat color, or whatever) we would get domestic versions of these animals. Musk oxen tamed and farmed for qiviut, and moose tamed and kept for their milk, are good examples of tame-but-not-yet-domestic animals. Humans have recently domesticated animals from tamed wild individuals- the African Eland, and the Russian fox. Even selectively breeding animals for docility and human cooperation is a bit of a roll of the dice- domestic animals easily go feral and express the instincts of their wild ancestors rather than those bred into them by people.

Both have historically not been great for women's empowerment. Women that have been told by the Church to obey their husbands, and ignored when they go to the doctor might look for something different \n\n\\- female power in non-Western and/or Ancient beliefs. In some non-Western (more specifically, some African and Indian) and/or Ancient (paganism, Druids, Native American, some Greek, Roman or Nordic) cultures, mythologies, belief systems, female figures carry power over male figures (think: goddesses, witches, matriarchs, queens, divine hunters, worriers, tricksters, etc.) Often these figures get associated with physical elements, and then with objects such as gemstones. \n\n\\- women generally care about their health and appearance more than men. This combined with female mistreatment by the medical establishment leads to women turning to things like Ayurveda, Reiki, and Traditional Medicine. \n\n\\- general lack of scientific knowledge. This is NOT to suggest that women are more stupid than men, but that some of the \"gurus\" that peddle woo often couch it in scientific terms that, unless you know the real science behind the terms, it can be hard to tell what is legitimate and what isn't. The example that is my own personal bug-bear (and the one I wrote my thesis on in college) is quantum mysticism. charlatans like Deepak Chopra (a regular favorite of Oprah, a hugely popular woman-targeted show) willfully misappropriate quantum physics to promote Ayurveda (Indian traditional medicine)- taking Shroedinger's cat and quantum uncertainty and turning it to such conclusions as \"you are God in drag\" and \"thoughts become things\" (from The Secret, promoting the Law of Attraction, whereby if you wish for something hard enough, it will literally \"manifest\" for you in your living room). If you haven't studied quantum physics, cell biology, chemistry, or evolutionary biology with some rigor, it can be hard to tell the real from the fake, and the fake can start to look very reasonable. This applies equally to men and women, but women are less likely to have this scientific grounding, and are more likely to find the notion that by wishing for a better life, they can attain it, attractive due to their social status in a male-dominated society. \n\n\\- popular culture and the social component. Whether by culture or nature, women (at least in Western society) have more opportunities to hang out in social groups platonically. When this is a social group of similar-age women, some topics of general interest might include television, books, movies, and magazines that promote woo (see Oprah, above). This is one reason it is so important that charlatans be given as little airtime and exposure as possible. Deepak Chopra, David Wolfe, and Dr. Oz are all examples of celebrity \"gurus\" pushing this B.S. \n\n\\- the internet. Last but certainly not least, the rise of the internet and social media has pushed woo onto women with particular fervor. First, it is or course great that women have the tools to look beyond their immediate social or cultural sphere and learn about things like female oppression, patriarchy, and the abuses of organized religion. It is through sites like Reddit that women and teens can realize that, say, a boyfriend is being abusive, a company has an all- male board or directors, or a medical professional is being misogynistic- things they might not have figured out due to lack of external information or reference. Naturally, the rise of MLM marketing and social media like Instagram promotes woo and pseudoscience in a very appealing atmosphere of social popularity (attractive to both men and women, but a particular motivator for women in the social media space).", "created_utc": "1649081310.0", "edited": "False", "id": "i3cr0sd", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_tvoiar", "parent_id": "t3_tvoiar", "score": "2", "subreddit": "TooAfraidToAsk", "subreddit_id": "t5_2ssp7"}, {"author": "Grey_Gryphon", "body": "when Reddit \u201cfound\u201d the Boston Marathon bomber.

We humans have tamed all sorts of animals throughout history (zebra, must ox, elephants, etc.) What we haven't done is selectively breed the ones we tame into a group of \"reliably nice animals\", in the same way that  we've selectively bred other kinds of animals for \"reliable niceness\" or \"reliable long-horn-ness\" or \"reliable red coat-ness\". \n\nas to why... that's really hard to say for sure. Some animals don't take well to being domesticated, or even tamed. Some aren't worth the effort to house and feed and so have been left alone. animals that are generally small and manageable, don't eat the same things we do (thus not competing with us for food), and are social animals with a social hierarchy (so if we capture and tame the leader, its easier to get the rest of the group), are generally easier for humans to domesticate. This isn't necessarily a hard and fast rule- more of a guideline. Cows originate from a herd of no more than 40 animals penned in present-day Turkey. They were nearly impossible to domesticate ([https://www.wired.com/2012/03/cattle-ox-origins/](https://www.wired.com/2012/03/cattle-ox-origins/)). Horses, like cattle, show signs of small-population domestication, supplemented by breeding captive animals with wild ones. It also has to do with the people doing the domesticating- how they interact and communicate with each other, what resources they have at their disposal, what resources they have to care for dependent animals, their tolerance for risk, their tolerance for physical injury, etc. One interesting case study in animal domestication is the African Eland, Africa's only native domestic livestock animal. Antelope, like deer, usually panic in confinement and can kill themselves trying to escape, but eland seem chill enough (or were made chill enough) to be domesticated. Funny enough, they were first domesticated in Russia and Ukraine, rather than Africa, from relocated zoo animals.

I meant to delete a previous comment of mine addressed to roboraptor3000! I must've inadvertently deleted the comment above it in my profile feed, not below. My apologies! there was a lot going on yesterday\n\nfor sake of transparency, I'll paraphrase the accidentally deleted comment below, in good faith to show that I do indeed mean for it to be seen: \"the sign was posted in public and they clearly meant for people to see it. I can't be responsible for the strange goings-on of the internet\" \n\nYou are very right and I apologize. It's tough sometimes having a brain wired for STEM logic at the expense of empathy and impulse control. High Functioning Autism ain't no joke sometimes. Your comment did get me thinking, so I took the liberty of researching the legal parameters of photography and photographers. There's a lot of legalese, but here's a handy chart that distills it all: [http://www.krages.com/ThePhotographersRight.pdf](http://www.krages.com/ThePhotographersRight.pdf) The most salient part for me is this line: \"anyone may take photographs of whatever they want when they are in a public place or places where they have permission to take photographs. Absent a specific legal prohibition such as a statute or ordinance, you are legally entitled to take photographs. Examples of places that are tradition- ally considered public are streets, sidewalks, and public parks. Property owners may legally pro- hibit photography on their premises but have no right to prohibit others from photographing their property from other locations.\" As I was clearly on the public side of the fence, I am well within my rights to take a photograph of the sign which, ipso facto- was hung in public. \n\nAs for what I thought, yes! you're exactly right! By hanging said sign in a very public manner, Samantha's parents obviously wanted it to be seen! As for limiting it only to people who walk dogs in the neighborhood, there was no stipulation to that effect on the sign. Nowhere does it say \"neighbors only please!\" or \"local dog owners only!\" or anything like that. I couldn't attend, so I thought someone else would. Turns out I was right! that's the magic of the internet. \n\nI must respectfully disagree that I had been \"told\" they've been doing this for years and had 10 people and the wife didn't seem into it. So far, you are one of only two out of 137,300 people who saw the post that had any problem with it whatsoever. And while I was \"told\" many things, the overwhelming majority were along the lines of \"they loved it!\" and \"they were thrilled so many people care!\" and \"they were excited to have so many people!\". Comment after comment expressing nothing but joy and enthusiasm. And sure the wife might not have \"been into it\", but by your own admission she was \"too nice to say\" anything, and your quip that \"I could be wrong\" doesn't give me confidence that what you \"told\" me was correct. You might be able to read body language and all, but a simple eye roll is ambiguous. I do not have faith in your expertise in reading the situation, and your flimsy statements of \"maybe\" or \"perhaps\" or \"I'm not sure\" and \"I could be wrong\" does not inspire confidence. You have not sold me on the verity of what you \"told\" me. You are not the sole arbiter of interpreting human nonverbal communication, so I have no choice but to write it off. Now, if Samantha's owners themselves want to make a Reddit account to tell me off, then that's a different matter. \n\nIt's interesting you bring up appropriate responses. Appropriateness and inappropriateness depends on context. Surely you'd agree that what is appropriate in one context (say, a wedding) is different than what is appropriate in another (say, a funeral). If the police were called due to my actions, then you are correct. The appropriate response would be \"Sorry, I wasn't thinking\". However, that did not occur, so my response reaffirming my rights to photograph things in public is not inappropriate. Perhaps you think that \"appropriateness\" depends on obedience, and by not knuckling under and apologizing, I am being disobedient to you and thus, inappropriate. If that is indeed the case, consider therapy. The thing is, I very much was thinking. I thought it was cute, I knew I couldn't go, I knew other people would be interested, and I made sure I was within my legal rights to photograph and post online. There was nothing else to think about. \"Oh\", I can hear you saying right now \"but you didn't think about the consequences of your actions\". Yes I did. I just disregarded them as unlikely scenarios. I would urge you to take a similar tack, since everything can be filmed or photographed and put online. I'd hate to see you do something (you made an informed decision to consider) innocuous, only to have it plastered all over the internet in perpetuity. \n\nWhile I am flabbergasted that my post went viral (and will continue to do so throughout the coming weeks once other outlets publish it- I have been contacted for permissions), and that many many more people saw it than the usual 1 or 2 or 10 people that normally see what I post, I firmly stand by my decision to do so, as it was made not from a place of \"not thinking\", as you claim, but rather from a place of utilitarian logistics ( I can't go, someone else might). I'm sure the Australian child struggling with depression, the young gay couple in Norway, the woman who recently lost her labradoodle, and the young man whose house burned down (all these people reached out to me via private message to say that Samantha made them happy for the first time in days) appreciate my decision to post over your pointed suggestion that it was a bad idea, due to your strangely authoritarian arbitration of yourself as the sole interpreter of human behavior. If Samantha's owners are people you and I and everyone else would like to know, they'd understand that too. \n\nThanks for all you do for our neighborhood! \n\np.s. let your adult children celebrate a birthday in whatever manner, and for however long, they choose! You might just have a thing against birthdays, I dunno.

Providence is built on several hills (College, Smith, Mt. Hope, Federal, etc.), and a lot of the community vibe is based on and around those hills. It's more of a mixed bag down in between the hills, in the heart of Downtown, as far as car chaos goes. It can get busy, but it usually isn't bad. Where Brown is located, people are generally wealthier, more liberal, more progressive, and more connected than in other parts of Providence. Brown's campus and student life is centered on College Hill, while many professors, doctors, and other working professionals live farther North along Hope St in the east side or down by Blackstone Boulevard. There have been a few issues with noise and people taking motorbikes drag-racing along the Boulevard, but that's the only complaint really. There are always bad apples sometimes, but more bored kids luring around India Point Park smoking dope than anything else. Downtown is trendy, gotten more so in the last ten years or so- the heart of downtown right off of RISD's campus is usually safe during the daytime (and there is a nightlife on the weekends mostly centered around the theater)- lots of cool shops and a great restaurant scene. Other parts of providence can be sketchier, but nowhere too bad it can't be navigated with common sense. North Providence is pretty OK (you will have to deal with the PC students and their parties), south Providence around Broad street is another story. I was in that area for elementary school for a few years, and I wouldn't recommend it after dark. Providence has one of the highest levels of income inequality, and sometimes high unemployment and high rates of homelessness. It hasn't been spared the effects drugs or inner city crime. The main bus terminal at Kennedy Plaza can sometimes be sketchy, but it is pretty well policed. In general all of Providence is well policed and you shouldn't have a problem.", "created_utc": "1623008734.0", "edited": "False", "id": "h0ttzrb", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_ntppip", "parent_id": "t3_ntppip", "score": "11", "subreddit": "BrownU", "subreddit_id": "t5_2sbc1"}, {"author": "Grey_Gryphon", "body": "it went very well!", "created_utc": "1623007653.0", "edited": "False", "id": "h0trn49", "is_submitter": "True", "link_id": "t3_nslm1s", "parent_id": "t1_h0tl86q", "score": "3", "subreddit": "aww", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1o"}, {"author": "Grey_Gryphon", "body": "r/borkdays", "created_utc": "1622989008.0", "edited": "False", "id": "h0sp3pu", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_ntapo9", "parent_id": "t3_ntapo9", "score": "2", "subreddit": "aww", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1o"}, {"author": "Grey_Gryphon", "body": "perfection", "created_utc": "1622988831.0", "edited": "False", "id": "h0soqn0", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_nt5rsq", "parent_id": "t3_nt5rsq", "score": "1", "subreddit": "aww", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1o"}, {"author": "Grey_Gryphon", "body": "awesome!", "created_utc": "1622988418.0", "edited": "1623616475.0", "id": "h0snza9", "is_submitter": "True", "link_id": "t3_nsxuml", "parent_id": "t1_h0q6443", "score": "1", "subreddit": "aww", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1o"}, {"author": "Grey_Gryphon", "body": "oh my god that's so epic! you deserve all the internet karma", "created_utc": "1622988298.0", "edited": "False", "id": "h0snrav", "is_submitter": "True", "link_id": "t3_nsxuml", "parent_id": "t1_h0sgcsz", "score": "1", "subreddit": "aww", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1o"}, {"author": "Grey_Gryphon", "body": "I saw that post to.. it just breaks your heart", "created_utc": "1622988214.0", "edited": "1624457814.0", "id": "h0snlv1", "is_submitter": "True", "link_id": "t3_nsxuml", "parent_id": "t1_h0ptayg", "score": "1", "subreddit": "aww", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1o"}, {"author": "Grey_Gryphon", "body": "I agree, but everything went off without a hitch!", "created_utc": "1622987898.0", "edited": "False", "id": "h0sn0k2", "is_submitter": "True", "link_id": "t3_nsxuml", "parent_id": "t1_h0qdw9f", "score": "3", "subreddit": "aww", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1o"}, {"author": "Grey_Gryphon", "body": "He was a hero!", "created_utc": "1622986617.0", "edited": "False", "id": "h0skn9c", "is_submitter": "True", "link_id": "t3_ntlle1", "parent_id": "t1_h0skceo", "score": "3", "subreddit": "aww", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1o"}, {"author": "Grey_Gryphon", "body": "stay posted! this might end up there", "created_utc": "1622985455.0", "edited": "False", "id": "h0silrg", "is_submitter": "True", "link_id": "t3_nsxuml", "parent_id": "t1_h0pwywm", "score": "2", "subreddit": "aww", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1o"}, {"author": "Grey_Gryphon", "body": "the bumps on a humpback whale\u2019s head", "created_utc": "1622979436.0", "edited": "False", "id": "h0sa0ik", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_nti9pp", "parent_id": "t3_nti9pp", "score": "2", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i"}, {"author": "Grey_Gryphon", "body": "I\u2019ll PM you", "created_utc": "1622977929.0", "edited": "False", "id": "h0s88yz", "is_submitter": "True", "link_id": "t3_nslm1s", "parent_id": "t1_h0s6t3d", "score": "1", "subreddit": "aww", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1o"}, {"author": "Grey_Gryphon", "body": "still got the GoFundMe open for Samantha and for our local shelters! \n\nhttps://www.gofundme.com/f/give-samantha-the-best-birthday", "created_utc": "1622945269.0", "edited": "False", "id": "h0r39nn", "is_submitter": "True", "link_id": "t3_ntb4qg", "parent_id": "t3_ntb4qg", "score": "1", "subreddit": "aww", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1o"}, {"author": "Grey_Gryphon", "body": "that's so cool!", "created_utc": "1622942924.0", "edited": "False", "id": "h0qz71t", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_nt95qh", "parent_id": "t3_nt95qh", "score": "1", "subreddit": "Bitcoin", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s3qj"}, {"author": "Grey_Gryphon", "body": "it went well!", "created_utc": "1622942575.0", "edited": "False", "id": "h0qyl13", "is_submitter": "True", "link_id": "t3_nslm1s", "parent_id": "t1_h0qujp3", "score": "3", "subreddit": "aww", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1o"}, {"author": "Grey_Gryphon", "body": "oh no!

His unit landed on Omaha beach in normandy, France and by the end of the war, they were in east Germany near the Czech border. anyways, after fighting through the ardennes forest in Belgium, the U.S. forces wound up in Luxembourg. This was in early march. on march 10, grandpa's unit was stationed in Echternach, preparing to push across the river into Germany. He never forgot that day because someone gave him ice cream. Someone (a civilian in the town, I guess) gave ice cream to the US soldiers- the infantry boys of the 89th up front, and the artillery (including my grandpa) further back. it wasn't from the US field kitchens, since they didn't have that capacity and were too far away/ recovering after the battle through the ardennes (and all their dairy products came from a can), so it had to have come from someone in the town. \n\nI was born in the mid 1990's, so my grandpa was pretty old by the time I came around. By the time I was old enough to take an interest in the war and begin to ask him questions, he had forgotten a lot of the details. However, he never forgot echternach. By the end of his life, his memory was really fading. He forgot our names and birthdays and the names of his favorite sports teams (the Mets and the Yankees. New Yorker through and through!) he remembered four things about the war by the time he died in 2018: getting seasick on the boat into normandy, ice cream in echternach, the forced labor camp his unit had to clean out, and falling asleep over a \"liberated\" barrel of German alcohol the night the war ended. \n\nThe last person alive from my grandpa's unit is a 97 year old man who lives near Buffalo. I met him in 2019, just before we moved and before the pandemic happened. I kid you not, the first thing this guy said to me about the war was \"well, I remember a place called Luxembourg.

There is a difference between domesticating an animal and taming/gentling/habituating it (though, not as big of a difference as some people think). Domestication happens on a genetic level- the result of selective breeding for \"kindness to humans\", the same as selective breeding for muscle mass or coat color. For domestication to happen, there needs to be both wild species that are open to the idea, and human populations willing and able to do the domesticating. For it to work, the animals need things like social hierarchies in their community groups, while the humans need things like fast reaction time, strong communication ability, and novelty-seeking/prosocial behavior. Many wild species, like bison or deer, didn't get to the point of being selectively bred. Deer panic in confinement, bison don't respect fences (or each other). The same could be said for the wild ancestors of modern domestic livestock (aurochs, for instance- the wild ancestors of cattle), but enough of them could be confined and brought under control enough to thrive and reproduce in confinement for humans to selectively breed them for docility. All taurine cattle originate from a herd of about 80 aurochs first penned in ancient Anatolia (modern day Turkey), so this might have been an incredible stroke of luck more than anything else. The line between taming and domesticating is blurry, and there are many cases of individual animals from non- domestic species being tamed and even utilized by people (Lord Rothschild had tamed and trained zebras as carriage horses, there are cases of people having pet buffalo, pet deer, moose dairy farms, etc.). I guess the difference is genetic, where domestication can be determined by a DNA sample (not that \"kindness to humans\" is a genetically- encoded trait the way coat color or horn length is, but breeding for \"kindness to humans\" also breeds in concurred physical traits in domestic animals- doglike floppy ears and curly tails in Russian domestic foxes, or specific skull traits that separate the skeletons of domestic dogs from wild wolves, etc.).

I was in 8th grade, and I was out of school on an admission interview at a local high school. There was snow in the forecast, but the Providence school administration thought that, since there had been so many \"false alarms\" over the past few years, they wouldn't risk missing a day of school (which they'd have to make up at the end of the year). The weather reports are often wrong around here anyways. So, school stayed open. My interview started just as the first snowflakes fell, and by the time I got out of there, it was coming down full-pelt. We still had to get back to school (maybe 15 miles away), to pick up my brother, who was in 2nd grade. By the time we got back to the school, there were 6 inches on the ground. It was getting dark, and all the students at the school, my brother included, were huddled up in the cafeteria. Maybe the weather reports weren't bluffing this time. Bus numbers were called as the buses arrived, and the kids (some of them in 1st and 2nd grade) had to wade through now 8 inch drifts to get to their buses. We drove, so we got my brother and proceeded to wait in traffic as it continued to snow. Buses refused to start, or got stuck in snow. It was near-whiteout conditions on the highways, with cars, buses, and trucks stuck and shut off. We got through in our awesome little Subaru station-wagon, took us 4 hours to get back to the East Side, where we lived. Most of the streets hadn't been ploughed yet, so Mom proceeded to slalom up a side- street, through well over a foot of snow. Finally, we got to our street, but we couldn't get down it. My brother and I got out, trudged over to our front porch, got the snow shovels, and started to dig a path to our driveway. After about 45 minutes, we got a big enough trench dug, and we got the car into our driveway. We got inside and turned on the news, only to see the grim picture: Providence school students stuck on buses for up to 8 hours, parents, on their way to pick up there kids, stuck in snowdrifts, some parents couldn't make it, so the kids stayed at school well into the night. Eventually, a state of emergency was called, and the roads were all but closed to nonessential traffic. All in all, thousands of kids were stranded, emergency personnel shoveled out many school buses full of children, it took 2 days to clear the streets, and the Providence School Board took so much flak for their bad decision that they've been very, very gun-shy ever since.", "created_utc": "1601493646.0", "edited": "False", "id": "g77gh27", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_j2ioik", "parent_id": "t3_j2ioik", "score": "1", "subreddit": "MapPorn", "subreddit_id": "t5_2si92"}, {"author": "Grey_Gryphon", "body": "I thought the letters on a license plate were the initials of the car's owner.

Arrived in Swansea on Nov 1, sent to Liverpool, Blanford, and Andrews Field. Shipped out to Normandy in June 1944. Fought from Omaha Beach, through Vierville Sur Mer, and across the Cotentin Peninsula to Avranches, La Haye Pesnal, and Pontorson. From there, grandpa's unit fought very quickly across Europe as part of General Patton's newly activated 3rd Army, reaching Chateaudun, Aris Sus Aube, and Coole by September 1944. From there, it was on to Verdun and Florange (France), and over the border into Longlier and Bastogne, Belgium. His unit, under Patton, come to the aid of the 101st Airborne at Bastogne. This was around Christmas, 1944. By March 1945, he was in Echternach, Luxembourg, and attached as antiaircraft support to the 89th Infantry. Then into Germany near the city of Trier, and north to Beuren. The 89th pressed west to the Rhine river, seeing action at St. Goar and crossing under heavy fire at Oberwesel on March 26th. All the infantry units had to split up to get around the Taunus mountains, and the 89th went south, keeping along the Rhine. Grandpa went through the Rhinegau, stopping at Oestrich, Winkel, and spending Easter Sunday (April 1st) in a Catholic church in the city of Kiedrich. From there, out of Hesse and into Gotha, Ohrdruf, and Weimar. From here, the 89th basically followed the highway (highway 4, I think it is today) from west to east, going through Lindenkreuz, Sirbis, and Oberalbertsdorf, before arriving in Zwickau (Sachsen). The war ended at 2:41AM on May 7th, 1945.
