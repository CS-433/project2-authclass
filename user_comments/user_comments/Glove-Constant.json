Should children be encouraged to focus on art rather than other subjects?\n\nTo me \"do you think\" doesn't sound like something you would see on an academic paper.  \n\nIts been an integral part of humankind as it depicts the piece of artwork's culture of origin. In my opinion, art should be taught to young people (then here I would say because...). However, its not necessary for them to focus on art instead of other academic subjects. In this essay, I will explain the reasons for my stance(or \"I will explain my rational).\n\nRemember, most of the time English speakers will use contractions unless for emphasis.  \n\nTeaching art to children can (can here is fine but it makes you sound unsure of the point) help them learn how to appreciate art. Aside from appreciating the beauty of the piece, teachers can get students to dive deeper into the hidden metaphors as well as the cultural and historical contexts. For instance, colour depth and tones may indicate the artist's emotions within the finished painting. Certain themes in artworks may even reflect the prosperity of an era, whether good or bad. Therefore, teaching school kids art not only develops their artistic sense, but its also a valuable opportunity for them to learn how to think more indepth. Most importantly, viewing art teaches adolescents the historical and cultural background of their country.\n\nThis paragraph was actually preety good.  I just changed some things to flow more naturally.  \n\nDespite the plethora of benefits teaching art offers to children, art should not be the centre of focus in the curriculum since its not particularly useful in most careers. The traditional major industries are: medicine, law and business. Contrastingly, only a handful of people pursue a career in the arts as it is hardly profitable for most. In the view of parents, many hope their kids can become successful and earn much money when they grow up. For that reason, they most likely won't support making art the main subject in schools.\n\nDido as last paragraph \n\nIn conclusion, children should learn how to appreciate art, but art shouldn't overshadow other subjects.\n\nI may have changed the meaning too much, but I think this sounds better.  \n\nOverall, this was really good.  Even without edits it sounds quite good.  Most people could tell your not native, but the important thing is that it's understandable.
