One of those things where you don\u2019t appreciate what you have until you don\u2019t have it anymore.\n\nI myself am not Bangladeshi, but my wife is, and just due to circumstance we live close to 8 hours away from her parents by car (my parents live even farther). COVID restrictions haven\u2019t helped either.\n\nThe lack of cultural exposure stresses us out somewhat. So we make a concerted effort to do as much as we can, especially for our son\u2019s benefit.\n\nBangladeshi culture: music, food, language, history, are all wonderful.
