The addition of stand-up grappling also helps broaden your horizons a bit more.\n\nSpeaking of which, Judo is a somewhat underestimated martial art in a currently BJJ dominated scene, but if you can find a great Judo school/club I still think they are a far more adaptable and practical way to get introduced to grappling than any BJJ school.

I had read a bit about academic fencing, so I knew in principle that fencing with \"real swords\" was a thing, and I wanted to try and somehow learn to use the rapier through fencing, but foil kind of fell short for me, and when my parents stopped taking me one day (one of those families where that happened a lot) I didn't press the issue too much.\n\nAnyway: what I was unaware of, because it was still fairly underground until recently, is that there *is* a sport that specifically trains to use these old, \"real swords\".

While back from uni over the summer, I randomly met that friend again because there was a parade going through my town (big thing in this country, happens around now, actually) and was chatting to them about how I'd maybe be more motivated to get out to that club if they taught Scottish broadsword, and they basically just questioned why I didn't just start my own study group?\n\nWell, I don't exactly know anyone else here I can form a group with, but a few years after that I decided to look into what it would take to actually start learning HEMA myself, settled on English sabre as a starting point, and have even toyed every couple of months or so with taking foil back up again.

Starting with gun laws, they run afoul of the learned wisdom from multiple studies done in the US, suggesting that limiting the types of firearms one can acquire has a negligible effect on gun crime, compared to limiting *who* can have those guns: the UK is already pretty restrictive on who can own firearms, so the bizarre hodgepodge of rules on what types of guns you can own is kinda pointless, honestly. Especially as many of the laws don't really seem like they'd entirely stop other tragedies from occurring: you can't own a centrefire self-loading rifle, but a large calibre handgun, that *must* be lawfully modified to something resembling a centrefire self-loading carbine (in most of the UK) is fine?\n\nAs for knife laws, they pretty much do just change in relation to whatever trend is apparent in knife crime statistics, logic be damned. Best example of this: for a while black gangs in London were using a lot of those cheap, Chinesium \"samurai swords\" for crime (they look really intimidating, and can do *some* damage, despite not really being usable as actual swords), and so the laws were changed to bar swords, blunt or sharp, over a certain length, that have a curve in the blade. As Matt Easton on YouTube has pointed out, this makes the average fencing foil an offensive weapon that is completely illegal to own (even if the peelers don't actively enforce it).\n\nIn both cases, the bones of a more sensible system is there, but the UK public is particularly prone to demanding that anvils be banned under \"Wile E's law\", etc., rather than taking the time to think hard about the root causes of tragedies and making reasoned interpretations of where current laws and regulations failed, and where changes would simply not have helped.", "created_utc": "1656668317.0", "edited": "False", "id": "iefkul3", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_vomed0", "parent_id": "t3_vomed0", "score": "1", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i"}, {"author": "Nurhaci1616", "body": "Jotaro flinches when Koichi moves toward him, because he sees a 9 foot 8 giant that could accidentally crush his bones if he's not careful.", "created_utc": "1656590075.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ieb2xq0", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_vnyswm", "parent_id": "t1_ieb2qct", "score": "94", "subreddit": "ShitPostCrusaders", "subreddit_id": "t5_3f7q5"}, {"author": "Nurhaci1616", "body": "It's an artistic thing that happened to be fairly common in 90's manga, but that you'll still see every so often around: the character's short stature is meant to be a kind of metaphor for their confidence and self-esteem, so they are not literally seen as short \"in universe\", but they themselves and/or people around them perceive them as being small and weak.

Should the UK do something similar with its most strategically vital spots in Scotland?\n\nPros:\n\n-Both the listed facilities have important defensive purposes (against you know who, given the situation out East), and will continue to be important for the UK's defence even after Scottish Independence. Scotland would likely not be able to properly provide the necessary defensive capabilities needed if independent, so letting the UK continue to do it benefits both parties.\n\n-They would enable some kind of continued Scottish military tradition in British service to carry on.\n\nLook, that first one is *very important*, so sorry if this list seems kinda small...\n\nCons:\n\n-Scotland might, reasonably, demand some form of payment to allow this. It may be something relatively easy (an older Frigate or two, and a handful of patrol vessels to kick-start their naval defence), or something more difficult (if you think your rent is bad, try paying for nuclear weapon storage...). This could either cost the UK some ships they wanted rid of anyway, or an annual stipend **on top of** continued spending on the sites. Who knows?\n\n-When you remove the risk of total nuclear annihilation, Scotland is a net beneficiary of these sites: their contributions to say, Trident, are generally seen as being outweighed by the economic benefit to local communities around Faslane who work there and provide shops and services for the military. You could technically make it a rule that all contractors need to be flown in from England or something, but it wouldn't completely eliminate the problem, and Scotland could reasonably say that this is unreasonable. The economic benefits are therefore being felt by an independent Scotland, and not by a Scotland within the UK, *who is also contributing to the budget*.\n\n-Nukes are politically unpopular, and protests against them specifically, as well as a continued UK military presence at all are likely to intensify in an independent Scotland.

Inadmissibility of evidence- These groups are fond of the \"honeytrap\" approach, however most fail to understand that this generally doesn't count as evidence outside of warranted police actions in most cases. It doesn't matter if they *thought* they were sending sexually explicit messages to a 13 year old girl, because they were actually sending them to a consenting 48 year old man...\n\nAnother issue in this regard is their penchant for violence and aggression, and their refusal to carry out their work without shoving a FB live stream on their phone in the suspect's face. These things can potentially complicate matters in situations where they actually have found, and *could potentially help convict* a real nonce.\n\n2.) Refusal to work with the police- Usually the response to the above criticism is that they have no desire to work with the police, because \"they do fackin nathin\", or something to that effect. Unfortunately, because the PPS does not generally consider Facebook posts and WordPress blogs when deciding whether to press charges for a crime, this distrust of, and refusal to cooperate with, the police inevitably results in a lack of real results.\n\nIn addition, it's worth pointing out the kinds of people who often participate in these groups.

This was partly because of her (at the time) famous beauty, and youth relative to him, but also because she became fairly earnestly involved in a load of occult, vaguely new age \"magic\"-type stuff, which meant a lot to Yeats. Anyhoo, by the time they met, she was already romantically involved with an older, married man, and never really showed *that* much interest in Yeats.\n\nAnd yet, the lifelong simping began.\n\nThere's a whole load of stuff that went on in Maud Gonne's life that'd be worthy of its own thread, or even a dedicated post on a history subreddit, so I'll unfortunately have to leave that there, other than to say that the consistent attempts to woo her persisted even as she was facing bereavement and new relationships, a full career, a large amount of activism in the burgeoning suffragist and Irish Republican movements and a bizarre attempt to FMA alchemy her son back to life by banging in his mausoleum...\n\nEventually she would in fact marry, specifically a war hero officer from an Irish cavalry regiment: Yeats would stop proposing to her, but still simp hard. Then the marriage would break down, and Maud would leave him, and Yeats would support her by (possibly) fabricating allegations that he had been molesting her daughter, Iseult, from a previous relationship (although there is circumstantial evidence to believe it *may* have been true, the truth is lost to history).\n\nThen after her son was executed for participation in the 1916 Easter Rising, Yeats decided to propose again the year after, **first to Maud, and then to her silver medal daughter immediately after being rejected** (yes, the same daughter as above). Yeats had known her since she was four, and had taken a fairly wholesome parental interest in her career hitherto, so much so that *rumours circulated that he was her father*. \n\nShe legitimately did consider this much older man's proposal, but decided against it largely so as not to upset her mother.\n\nAh, but our protagonist has a happy ending regardless: having amassed a large group of hangers on from both his poetry and occult \"knowledge\", the nearly 60 year old Yeats graciously deigned to marry a much younger woman from among them, not as his treasured wife, or even silver medal, but as a consolation prize to himself...\n\nPoets truly speak the language of love and romance.", "created_utc": "1642103830.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hsj2usw", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_s30i2a", "parent_id": "t3_s30i2a", "score": "19", "subreddit": "books", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh4i"}, {"author": "Nurhaci1616", "body": "The Catholic church has historically been more a fan of proselytism, both through missionary work and (historically) crusades and conquest: compounding this is the fact that, although some Orthodox states, such as Russia especially, also promoted these kinds of approaches, the Catholic nations of Europe were kind of just better at it.\n\nPerhaps there is some alternate timeline in which Russia were the ones to lead the way in colonising the new world, or in which the Byzantine empire remained a powerful force in Europe and North Africa long enough to change things around, but we live in a timeline where Spain led the way to the new world, in the name of gold, glory and God.", "created_utc": "1641979785.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hsbv963", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_s1ztda", "parent_id": "t3_s1ztda", "score": "4", "subreddit": "Catholicism", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qi4f"}, {"author": "Nurhaci1616", "body": "It's like Pro Wrestling: just because it isn't \"real\", doesn't mean it doesn't take a whole load of skill, technique and athleticism.

I'm **not** saying that neopagans never come from outside the associated ethnicity, but rather that it'll always struggle to overcome that perception, much like the Eastern Orthodox churches.\n\n2.) Lack of unifying features/practices/beliefs. Judaism survives without the kind of leadership you describe, in no small part due to a general unity in Jewish beliefs and practices, which helps foster a separate identity: on the other hand, diverging practices in liturgy and ecclesiology were no small part in Christianity splintering between east and west. The \"do your own thing, dude\" approach that 90% of neopagans follow is suitably new age and individualistic, but does little to foster a shared identity.\n\n3.)

To add to it:\n\nThe IRA didn't exactly form neatly, so much as it was a coalescence of various disparate armed groups under a new, unified banner. This included the Irish Volunteer Force, and the Marxist Irish Citizen's Army, who both thought in the Easter Rising, as well as members of the National Volunteer Force, who split from the IVF prior to Easter 1916 on the issue of supporting the British in WW1. \n\nAfter the Anglo-Irish War, the IRA split between the new National Army, and a group called the \"Irregulars\" by the new government. Both claimed to be the legitimate continuation of *the* IRA, although only the Irregulars kept that name (the Irish Defence Forces kept the IVF's Irish name, \u00d3glaigh na h\u00c9ireann, however). After the Civil War they continued the fight in principle, if not always in practice, with a brief \"border campaign\" prior to The Troubles.\n\nAfter the Border Campaign, the IRA gradually slid left until eventually proclaiming itself a Marxist Organisation, in the mold of the older ICA: in the \"Battle of the Bogside\" in 1969, they refused to intervene on the grounds that they considered siding with the Catholic working class over the Protestant working class sectarian and counter-revolutionary (they sought to abolish the divide, and unite the two communities in a communist, 32 county state).\n\nThis resulted in an uproar amongst Derry's republicans, leading to a bitter split in the IRA. The more nationalist faction became the Provisional IRA (what most people mean by \"IRA\" in the context of The Troubles) and expanded rapidly. The remainder became known as the \"Official IRA\" and maintained their Marxist stance, although they also became involved in the paramilitary campaigns to follow.\n\nThe next **really** major split occured in the aftermath of the GFA, as various factions within the different paramilitary groups formed for or against negotiated peace, leading gradually to the plurality of \"IRA's\" today.
