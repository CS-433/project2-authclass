It's difficult as obviously we have a lot of words that are spelt similarly to one another but are said differently. Phonics is a really simplified version of the IPA I suppose (EDIT: The International Phonetic Alphabet, it's the closest system I can think of that is similar in terms of teaching sounds to specific letters/symbols!), we teach the child the letters (as opposed to the symbols) and the sound that they can usually expect those letters to make. We also teach them to break down words to the sounds that they think they would make. There is a system called Jolly Phonics which is pretty much the standard phonics program and I'd say that most schools use it. It tries to make phonics fun by mixing it into songs and rhymes and linking sounds to things. For example, the letter/sound \"s\" is commonly represented by a snake, so the children will see a picture of a snake in the shape of an \"s\" and they'll do snake actions when they make the sound. We have levels of books for children to learn from which uses words that they should know or be able to 'break down' at that level.\n\nWith some words, learning to spell them is a case of drilling a spelling into the child because there is no other way of getting them to learn the word, other words are what we call \"sight words\", which are words that we teach them from quite early on to recognise by sight and they get progressively harder as the child advances. So words like \"I\", \"my\" and \"play\" are relatively simple sight words, and later they would learn words like \"because\", \"around\" and \"would\".\n\nChildren make many many mistakes when learning to read and write. When they are younger they make what we call \"virtuous errors\", which is when they apply a concept that they know and understand to a new word but it's wrong, so they know that duck would have the plural form of ducks, so they apply the same rule to goose to make gooses instead of geese. I think that there is some continuation of that when they start reading and writing as well. Some of the first sounds they learn are \"c\" and \"k\" which make the same sound, so they would use them interchangeably until they were corrected, or not use both on words that end in \"ck\".

She's cheaper than local tutors and the same price as a class.\n\nEDIT: I should probably add that some tutors will be heavily following a book curriculum, some won't at all and a good tutor should tailor it to you. Our French tutor had her own \"curriculum\" that loosely followed a book and diverged off of the 'path' set by the book often. She also was a musician so at the end of each lesson we were given a Charles Trenet song to dissect! It was interesting though (to a non-musician!) and we listened to him at home as his voice is very clear so you can pick up bits from him.\nOur Spanish tutor tailors it to us, we mainly want to learn conversation right now so she's dived straight into that. I plan to do some lessons alone with her which will be about reading/writing/comprehension as well and she's perfectly fine to adapt things for me. Both were/are qualified teachers.\n\nOne thing I would advise for a few months into your language journey is a language exchange partner (if you have the time).

Our lot love them, more than mealworms. We use tubs that are aimed at pet tortoises. We use puppy milk bones and gravy bones to train our mischief, they love them. Ratty crack.\n\nPersonally, I wouldn't ever switch my mischief to a purely pellet diet, even one supplemented with fresh foods. I really don't understand the obsession with lab blocks when it comes to food :/ Rats like the variety, yes they pick and choose, and you can adapt your recipe to ensure that they get things that suit them.

Acting like a jerk could mean anything from just being a bit of a bully to full on aggressive behaviour all of the time.\n\nHave you tried anything to lessen the behaviours? Our alpha boy can be a PITA. His bad behaviour started in September and came to a head a few times but we've managed to curb it each time. Having him neutered is still on the cards for us if things change again, but our measures seem to have worked so we're avoiding it presently.\nIs Spore the alpha? If so, do you treat him like the alpha? As stupid as it sounds, if he doesn't think that you think he's the alpha, he may pick on Petri in order to make you see. We found a massive improvement in behaviour when we consciously made an effort to ensure that when we put our hands near the cage that we addressed Haku first, when they came out, he was to come out first, get treats first, be held for a few minutes alone first, etc.\nWe also spent a bit more time with him, both on his own and with his brother. During the first few weeks we didn't have his brother out without him but he did come out alone.\nThat worked brilliantly until we threw a baby into the mix.\n\nBaby had to be removed for his safety eventually, he's an ill boy and we think Haku realised. Haku now puffs up if he sees him and gets really angry if he sees him free-ranging, we have to cover the cage. He's fine watching the girls free range though!\n\nIn January we were having issues with him again, he was starting to attack his brother when they were free ranging, and didn't like us touching him at all when he was free ranging. He was antsy in the cage too and would turn aggressive with his brother for no reason. So after getting advice (our breeder thought that he may be thinking that the room we're in was his territory, which explained his behaviour towards his brother and us), we stopped free ranging him. He only came out on us or on the sofa. The aggression stopped within a week or two. We went on holiday two weeks ago for a week and he went to the rat sitters where he had more freedom than he'd get at home, we didn't mind, we were curious to see if we could start free-ranging him at home again tbh. For the first four days back he was an absolute dick, constantly tried to scrabble down our legs to the floor, was being a dick with his brother, etc. As soon as he remembered the status quo, it stopped.

Is it one particular rat screeching? It could just be a noisy/whiny rat. Is there an obvious hierarchy with them? The fact that there has been just the one injury (you'll notice others!) makes me think it is just standard fighting, do they sleep together? And have you noticed any aggression? The aggressivenss would be the key thing for me as to whether they need splitting up.\n\nOur two big boys fight fairly often, it started when they were about 8/9 months old and they'll have a very fast and furious looking chase every couple of days. They aren't aggressive with one another often though and they sort it out fairly quickly between them and are sleeping together within a matter of hours, so we leave them to it.

When you intro a new rat you can expect that newbie to be put in their place and bullied a bit. Our little one was in with the big boys for a month with a few issues, but nothing serious. Then suddenly big boy turned on him and we were lucky that we were there as we think that he would have killed him. In that case our baby was having seizures and in the wild, they would kill off those having them and we think that Big Boy realised that he had something wrong with him and decided to do this.\n\nThere was a marked difference in the way he treated the baby at that point, and his usual fights.

Water didn't distract him as well as it usually did either. Baby was removed from the cage as soon as we realised what was going on and Big Boy puffs up as soon as he sees him now, even though it's been three months since they were together.

Usually, they wouldn't sleep together if they took issue to one another. Generally, if there is no blood, it's considered normal behaviour. Obviously you've had an injury occur but is that a one off?\n\nAre they displaying signs of aggression? Puffing up or bashing each other from the side?

Do not do this with your hands. A spray bottle filled with water is a good way to separate rats without them realising that it's you interfering with them. If you are physically removing one from the situation, they can also get jealous, which adds to hierarchy issues. Do you have a preferred rat?

The only thing I'd suggest that you do differently right now is do not separate them manually yourself if possible. Use some outside distraction like a water spray and then take the dominant one from the situation as they're distracted. Water sprays work very well as long as they don't realise where it's coming from. \n\nThe idea behind this is that the dominant rat can be even more of a bastard to the new rat if they feel that you are showing favouritism to the new rat. I don't know if others found this but when we switched to distraction and then remove with our baby and the big boys it seemed to lessen the attitude towards baby.\n\nNeutering is something to consider but do use it as a last resort. There are risks associated with that so you need to spend time finding somebody to do it who is experienced, talking it through with them, etc. We're at that point with our alpha as he is an absolute dick sometimes. We had to remove baby in the end for his safety and for that and other reasons baby is now a lone rat (he has health issues that make him incompatible with being with others, and he is just categorically not interested in being with other rats). Big alpha will never have another rat apart from his brother with him I think. Even then, his brother gets beaten up every now and then (though no injuries).\n\nWhere in the world are you?

You just have to with rats over here. Do not get rats from P@H or similar stores, 99% of the time they are from rodent farms and we have amazing breeders all over the country. We're in a much better situation compared to in the US where the breeders are further spread, unless you're in the arse end of nowhere you're likely a 45 minute drive from a breeder at most. The rats from rodent farms are often not sexed correctly, they have been in tiny aquariums with their mother and siblings until 5 weeks which is when they're separated and taken to the shops. They are not very handleable because they aren't used to being handled. The only way we're going to stem the flow of rats from these places is to buy from actual breeders directly.\n\nHave you checked the NFRS list? We have five from two different NFRS breeders, they are well worth the wait. We had to travel 2 hours to get our boys, and now we've found a breeder we love local to us, we're always going to journey to get them from her, even when we're living 3 hours away again. Rats from a good breeder are so worth the wait.\n\nYou have Atlas Rattery within an hours drive from you, I've heard good thing about them and I know she has babies at the moment:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/pages/Atlas-Rats/168408555906?fref=ts\n\nHer current litter is a half Rivendell litter, our two older boys are Rivendell Stud and they are amazingly beautiful.

Our hospital cage has been this tiny cage we had to buy quickly when one of our boys had an emergency op and it was fine for a baby, but not good for bigger rats. We actually just bought a [very] large hamster cage as a new hospital/temp cage because we seem to have to use it so much for sprains and strains -_- It'd fit three in happily for a short amount of time so we can put all three of our girls in together if one gets injured.", "created_utc": "1414493316.0", "edited": "1414493821.0", "id": "clm0xag", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_2kicjo", "parent_id": "t3_2kicjo", "score": "3", "subreddit": "RATS", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qnh3"}, {"author": "nikadi", "body": "We considered it with ours and were planning to get it done for a while, but eventually decided against it. \n\nThe marking is not so much of an issue for us. You get to know your rat, it becomes predictable to a certain extent. Yes it's a PITA when Haku pisses on our computer mouses every time he goes near them, and plastic-y or shiny surfaces, but that's manageable for us. He's the main one who marks too, the others don't do it often.\n\nThe potential aggression issues are what I mainly wanted to do it for. However I'm lucky that, in the UK, most NFRS breeders will categorically not breed aggressive rats, so the genetic aggression is mostly factored out (mutations and recessive genes aside), so aggression would be behavioural. I have a very good, approachable breeder close to me who is happy to help you tackle anything, to the extent that if a rat becomes too aggressive she will take them in to rehome if she needs too. \n\nThen there's the fact of putting rats under, which is more risky due to their size. Having had one of our boys need emergency surgery very young, and the other having damaged lungs from a bad batch of bedding when he first came to us, our rodentologist vet recommended against the risk, she said that even with perfectly healthy rats, it wasn't something she was entirely comfortable with unless there were serious aggression issues.\n\nSo for us, the two pros were somewhat unbalanced to cons, but it's something that is very much a personal decision in which the context needs to be considered.\n\nFWIW, our breeder is also not a fan of spaying females and we had a very good discussion with her and our vet about it before doing it to our girls.\n\nNB: I'm wondering how long it'll take for my partner to suggest us naming our next pair after LOL characters, so far we have two (three on Monday!) Ghibli named boys and two Farscape themed girls.\n\n& if you don't already have one, find a vet who is used to rats. A lot of vets struggle with picking up URIs in rats, it's something we were hot on from the start, especially with Haku's bloody respiratory issues.\n\n\nEDIT: What I didn't say was that our two boys are now 10/11 months, prime time for aggression. Apart from Haku getting a bit arsey with Howl last month, we've had no signs of aggression. Last month we dealt with it, Howl was trying to usurp Haku as boss of the cage. Looking at the context of the situation and talking to our breeder we realised that we could be confusing them as we always went to Howl first when getting them out or spending time with them, because he is the more social one and always at the door whereas Haku takes a minute to acknowledge you before coming to say hello.\n\nSo we made sure that from then on we made of point of always touching Haku before touching Howl, always offering Haku anything before Howl, always putting Haku first, so that they both realised that we saw Haku as alpha. We made a point of doing it intensively for a few days, so opening the cage regularly, offering treats regularly, etc. Within a few weeks he was back to normal.\n\nAnecdotally, in the rat groups I'm in both online and RL, the only boys who've had them chopped off that I know of are those who were being aggressive, or rescues who've gone in with girls in a rehoming situation. I don't know of many who have been aggressive beyond a bit of it around 10-12 months and know of even less who were aggressive enough to go down the route of having to be neutered.", "created_utc": "1414481111.0", "edited": "1414505346.0", "id": "cllyqcj", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_2kidmn", "parent_id": "t3_2kidmn", "score": "4", "subreddit": "RATS", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qnh3"}, {"author": "nikadi", "body": "Thanks!

Our local breeder has a pet shop aimed at rat owners too so we go a bit crazy in there when we go to top up which also pushes the figure up!\n\nWe also have to spend a bit on healthcare, one of our boys is prone to URIs thanks to some bedding he was allergic to when we first got him, we think it damaged his lungs, so he's in and out of the vets which is between \u00a320-30 a time. We've also had two accidents that required emergency vets and treatments (\u00a380 a go) and a female with a tumour that needed to be put down in August.\n\nSo they can be pricey but we think that they are well worth it :) We put aside money each month and try to keep a few hundred put aside for healthcare at all times.\n\nRats aren't so much night animals as they are just polysomatic. They do end up syncing to your routines a bit as well. Ours tend to have one long sleep between 9am and 2/3pm, but are sitting by the doors waiting to play at 6am and 3pm!

We budget \u00a350 a month on maintaining them too, that's food/hammocks/toys/penny for their health pot/etc. It doesn't all get spent, but the extra is there just in case of another emergency or if the girls chew threw another fecking cage!", "created_utc": "1401646687.0", "edited": "False", "id": "chwioy0", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_270im6", "parent_id": "t1_chwcryr", "score": "1", "subreddit": "RATS", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qnh3"}, {"author": "nikadi", "body": "Haha, that's brilliant!", "created_utc": "1401259096.0", "edited": "False", "id": "chsxhl6", "is_submitter": "True", "link_id": "t3_26myv5", "parent_id": "t1_chsntln", "score": "1", "subreddit": "RATS", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qnh3"}, {"author": "nikadi", "body": "I have the opposite problem, finding things based in America ~~usually on thinkgeek~~ That I can't find over here and postage would be ridiculous.

Both the boys and girls did it, the girls liked using it as bedding too, so would rip strips off to take to their den. I did consider buying tiles to fit the bottom and covering those with fleece, or using a cardboard 'tray' to fit the bottom, which might be worth trying. I think substrate is used more commonly over here because of this being the primary design of the cages.

You'd have to be careful as to what wheel types to get too as the various types can cause issues. You'd essentially be looking for something like a Silent Spinner. They have solid bits for the rats to run on and no random bars that the rats can get injured by when running (or when jumping on to join a friend running ;) )\n\nI can't remember where we found this but it may be worth looking for some sound clips of what rats sound like when healthy, coming down with a URI (Upper Respiratory Infection), and really poorly. It will help you identify when you need to get your rats to a vet as they are very prone to URIs. However other things may cause them to come down with the first URI symptoms (the noisy breathing) so whilst it's worth knowing, you need to use your common sense before panicking about them too :) I speak from experience of rushing our boys to the vets and calling for advice a lot when changing substrate material, it turned out that they were allergic to sodding everything.\n\nIt looks like there isn't much in the way of toys and hammocks in the cage at the moment from the pictures? They're good, rats love hammocks. Any old t-shirt can be made into one using a pair of scissors to cut it up and four safety pins to hold it up :) We use a mix of old clothes, cheap kids trousers (for tunnels) and properly made fabric tunnels and hammocks for our mischief.

At first we were very careful about scooping. They may be taking a while to settle to you too, some too, it's fine.\n\nEnrichment-wise: make things. You can make so much for rats. Dapper rat (http://www.dapper.com.au/toys.htm) has a great page of homemade and cheap toys made from loo rolls and things. They may be bored if you don't have much for them in their cage. A wheel would be pointless unless they had one young, and wheels big enough (and safe) for rats are costly. You can make loads of toys out of simple thing you'll have lying around: garden twine, cardboard boxes, loo rolls tubes, loo rolls (put one on top of their cage, they love them!) and simple sewing skills will enable you to make hammocks and other toys. TBH, you can make them without sewing skills too, look up no-sew rat hammocks. We buy clothes form charity shops to cut up, a square of fabric (from a t-shirt or polar fleece jumper) with four safety pins makes a good hammock. The leg of a pair of kids trousers pinned up makes a great tube. You can make fabric yarn and knot it into nets. Etc :)\n\nOur girls were adopted by us at a year 6 weeks ago and we feel like they've bonded relatively well to us, they will bond later in life so don't worry about how bonds are forming now too much, you feeding them is enough to form a bond, so keep talking to them, etc, they'll get there.\n\nDicey mentioned food, and I'll reiterate the point: Rats love food. Give them food and they'll love you. Start small if you have to. One of our girls, Ruby, came out of her cage willingly for the first time last week. We've spent the five weeks before that bribing her with peanut butter. She's learnt to associate us with it too. It started by putting it on our fingers and putting it at the door of her hidey hole. Then slightly further back, then gradually moving to the door, then on top of her cage. Once she was comfortable on top of her cage she decided to jump into my other half's jumper with her sister. For a few weeks she's been coming to the door of her cage whenever she wants peanut butter, which is a massive improvement from hiding whenever we were in the room!\n\nAre the rats in a main room of your place? One where you spend most of your time? That would help massively. Just being around you, listening to your voice even if you aren't talking to them and watching you go about your daily business will make them  more curious about you and calmer around you.

You will likely end up acquiring more rats relatively quickly, they are just too bloody adorable ;)\n\nRescues can have issues with people and take a lot of work, we've had our girls for 6 weeks and one has only started letting us touch her in the past week, the other has been letting us hold her for about a week and a half. They came from a family who cared for them (though were ignorant to rat ownership unfortunately!) but having gone through the process with our bred pair we knew what the rewards were so the very long and slow process hasn't disheartened us as much as I think it would have done had we got them first. It prepared us for how to deal with hard nips and other things too. You really cannot tell how a rescue is going to be until you get them home, we were told that they were really sociable, loved cuddles, one would sit in your hood for hours, and the other 'loved hiding'. It has definitely been worth the effort but I do think that we were very lucky not to get a biter or something!\nWe're probably going to get a mix of bred and rescues in the future.\n\n\nYou have some great breeders up your way too, we got ours from somebody just off of the M25 but it was well worth it. I'd recommend them for their rats, but we're actually going to book a pair of rats from somebody else next time as the breeder was quite short with my other half and reserved us the wrong sex, and I'd rather support breeders who aren't arsey. You might need to travel a bit, ours was 2 hours away but again, well worth it as our boys are gorgeous!\n\n\nhttp://www.littlepetwarehouse.co.uk/ is good for cages, they have some good sized ones at good prices. We have bought two from there and will be buying a taller one from there eventually. We have the big coco rat cage and the little friends narrow bar bigger cage. The little friends is fine for two adult females but the shelves wouldn't support two adult males brilliantly, they bounced with our 3mo boys on them! But that cage has small doors like the Jenny, which is a massive PITA.\n\n\nIt might be worth getting a smaller cage too, we ended up paying through the nose for a tiny cage from a pet smart when one of our boys had an emergency op and needed to be separated from his brother for a few days, with hindsight it would have been better to buy a small cage for these emergencies in advance!\n\n\nI would recommend trying for a metal base though. Our boys aren't chewers but our girls are and it was obviously something that stemmed from boredom in their original home, but they chewed through two cages, one of which we've now lined with galvanised steel mesh, which was a pig!
