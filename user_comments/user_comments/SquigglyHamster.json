Is it a psychotic condition if it only comes out during drug use?\n\nI've updated my post -- I definitely don't think what happened to me was common. My mother has also taken THC-O and she said it affected her the same as regular weed. This is my second time taking THC-O, and I had a much lower dose the first time (not sure how much, but definitely not more than 15mg, which I know is still a lot). The first time I took THC-O, I also felt really weird and hated the experience, but it wasn't to this extent.\n\nAlso, when I've taken delta 8 before, there've been a couple times where it gave me an experience similar to sleep paralysis - I would wake up in the middle of the night almost convinced a roommate had come into my room.\n\nNevertheless, I'll bring it up to my doctor or my therapist if I can remember to.

But he would literally try to teach us things by using *quantum physics problems* as examples while also claiming that you needed no prior math knowledge to follow along, lol. Everyone in the class struggled. Sometimes it made me laugh just how many times students would raise their hands each lecture and say they had no idea what he was talking about. It was a level 400 class but no prerequisites required. I'm pretty sure there should've been some prerequisites for this course...\n\nBut the music appreciation was still harder. We had to do a written analysis 2 songs per week (500 words per song or something like that), do a listening analysis(?) on 4 songs per week (in which we did things like tell you what form was used, what instruments there were, something something crescendo something beats something rhythm), on top of that we had to do one quiz per week which always included listening to a minimum of 6 different songs and then listening to like 10 seconds of two different songs and answering which song the clip was from (and some of these songs were like 8 fucking minutes long).\n\nWe also had an exam every 3 weeks AND we had to do a huge-ass essay on a concert in which we had to deeply analyze like 4 different songs, AND we had to do the same thing for a movie musical. \n\nBut! Let me tell you the worst part!\n\n**If you were late on one single assignment in the class, you could not earn an A**. You had to do every single assignment on time to get an A in this class! No late work accepted. You had a week to do every assignment, and the only way in which you would be allowed to be late on an assignment is if you had a legitimate excuse for why you couldn't do it for every single day of that week. If you were given the assignment on Monday and it was due on Sunday, and you had a family emergency on Wednesday - Sunday, you were not allowed to be late if you had no excuse available for not doing it on Monday - Tuesday. \n\n**If you missed the concert evaluation or the musical movie analysis, you could not earn above a C.** You were not allowed to turn in either one late. If you were late by even 5 minutes, you would receive a zero.\n\n**If you missed a single class, you could not earn an A**. \n\nThis class had me on edge CONSTANTLY. It didn't matter if you got a 100% on every single assignment for the semester but were late on one single assignment - he would still manually change your grade to a B even if you would have otherwise gotten an A. \n\nI did get an A in this class, and it was the proudest A I've ever gotten. I worked my ass off for it, lol. You know it was bad when quantum fucking physics was less stressful. \n\nEven though the professor was harsh as fuck when it came to assignments, he was an amazingly passionate professor, and he inspired me to get a guitar. So it was a win in the end.\n\nOh, and as for Korean...It wasn't *difficult* per se, but there was so much work. (I think it was only easy for me because I already knew so much of the material because I was already at an intermediate level before taking this class). In the first semester of intermediate Korean, we had homework due 5 times a week Monday - Friday, and we had one quiz every other week, and one exam every 4 weeks. The homework assignments usually took about an hour to complete. On lighter days, it only took 10-15 minutes, on heavier days, it could take three hours. \n\nThe second semester of intermediate Korean was slightly easier in my opinion. We had homework due 3 times a week, and we had vocabulary quizzes twice a week. We had an easy 15-minute speaking exam once a week outside of class time. We had an exam every 3 weeks. \n\nI'm not sure how accurate this is, but I've heard that chemistry is hard for a lot of people, but I took a chemistry class and found it to be a walk in the park compared to music appreciation.

When you said \"We have 16 week semesters during spring, summer, and fall\", I thought you were saying your summer courses were 16 weeks long rather than 8 weeks long.\n\nI do not fully understand what you are talking about in this reply. You are taking 12 credit hours over the period of 16 weeks? If so, then yes, I would say that is the equivalent of taking 6 credit hours for 8 weeks.\n\nI have already addressed this issue [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/um1unu/14_credits_to_much_for_summer_semester/i80kgr6/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). There are many variables which go into determining the exact level of difficulty required in a shorter course, but it's close enough, in my opinion. I will go ahead and elaborate, but do note that I don't think it's a big deal.\n\nLet's say we have Art Class 1 (AC1) and Art Class 2 (AC2). Both are worth 3 credit hours each.\n\nDuring a regular full-length course, you have to paint 4 paintings in 16 weeks for AC1, and you also have to paint 4 paintings for AC2. You would have to do 8 paintings total for the semester.\n\n6 credit hours, **8 paintings. 2 painting every 4 weeks.**\n\nNow, let's say you are instead taking a summer course. You decide to take only one: AC1. The course is 8 weeks long, and you still have to paint 4 paintings.\n\n3 credit hours, **4 paintings. 2 paintings every 4 weeks.**\n\nNow, I totally see where you are coming from. 4 paintings \u2260 8 paintings. However, you are still producing two paintings every 4 weeks. This is what I meant when I wrote my original comment.\n\nWe could sit here and argue back and forth about all the different variables and semantics, how it isn't this simple, yada yada, but quite frankly, I do not have the interest in doing so. I was simply trying to warn OP about not overdoing it.\n\nIf you think my logic here is flawed, fine. I hear you loud and clear. I know my examples were oversimplified. I'm not trying to change your view. Just trying to express to OP (roughly) how much work they should be expecting. If you think it's less than 28 hours, then okay.

It's possible your major will require you to take a foreign language class. If that's the case, take it as early as possible to get a feel for it. Different people have wildly different experiences with studying languages at school. Personally, I had to take Japanese for my major (psychology). I had no interest in learning Japanese, but those 2 classes of Japanese will *always* be in my heart. It left a profound impact on me. I had the best teacher and a tight-knit relationship with my classmates. I learned so much Japanese, I didn't think it was even possible to make so much progress in only a year.

But I will talk about what it's like to be the person who doesn't send texts first.\n\nLook...to be honest, it's brutal, but all the people who I don't go out of my way to text first are people I don't feel connected to. They're just there, and they have more interest in our friendship than I am. I don't text them \"Hey\" because I don't care to. They put more value into the friendship than I do. They consider us friends while I consider us more like acquaintances (though I refer to them as friends in this post). And it's no fault of theirs, I just don't feel like there's anything for me to personally gain by going out of my way to communicate with them. The friendship does demand on them to keep communicating with me first, because I'm completely fine with it dying off otherwise.\n\nI have had friends who have brought up this issue and felt like they wanted more out of me, and I just explained that I'm not good at small talk (which is what conversations with them always ends up being--which I really have no interest in). There is one friend who I've had for about two years who recently expressed how much I mean to him (and I had no idea, I thought we both mutually felt like the other person was insignificant to the other). Since then, I have tried to engage in conversation with him more. But to tell you the truth, I feel no different about him. I don't think I'll ever care about him the same way he cares about me. I don't think the friendship will ever be mutually satisfying and fulfilling. It just floats along. I'm okay with that, but he probably years for more.\n\nYou might have to come to terms and face the possibility that the other person just doesn't feel the same way about the friendship as you do. You're putting in so much energy to keep it alive, but you're currently living with expectations for the other person to match you back on some level. Maybe you need to accept that they don't feel the same investment in it as you do. \n\nBut I don't think you should blame the other party or be bitter about it (not saying you're bitter, just saying that you should not become bitter). They never forced you to text them. Thinking \"Thanks for making me put time and energy into something\" is inherently flawed when they never made you put that time and energy into it. (It'd be different if they begged you to text them more and got upset when you didn't, but then were hypocritical and never put in that same level of energy. But from what you've described, it just sounds like you both want different things.)\n\nIf you still want your friendships to go forward and you don't want to give up on them, then you should consider telling them about this issue.

I will then spend about 15 minutes doing the assigned homework.\n\n\\- Try to do 5 minutes on the Drops app every day.

Although, \"top 1,000 words\" is misleading, the number is lower because there are a lot of words I already know.\n\n\\- If I have time, I try to use the app LingoDeer.

Don't ignore the signs of a bad friend just because they are a friend.

I look around at people who have the confidence to go up and talk to their classmates with ease and wonder how they do it. Some people can go to a bar alone and actually chat up other people. They can go to parties and insert themselves in fun situations (joining games, for instance.)\n\nBut that's not everyone. I wouldn't even say it's the majority? Confidence is a skill.

It's worse than not responding at all.

In the end, it is ultimately up to the professor to determine what is and isn't a reasonable expectation to have on the student.
