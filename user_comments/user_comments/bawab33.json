Nothing happens to the actual verb itself. If you learn the word look, you have the present tense, future, and imperative tense.

I don't care if you argue anything.  You shared and opinion and I shared mine. If you want a debate you have to start it.\n\nFat acceptance doesn't fly in the face of a damn thing. It doesn't argue at all that fat can come with health issues.\n\n1. It argues that most people citing health issues like you don't give a single shit about anyone's health. But it's become societally unacceptable to say eww fat at fat bodies, and pretending to care at all about some strangers health is now the only way to go eww you're fat and get away with it. And fat acceptance isn't interested in giving that loophole to minding one's business and not commenting on bodies not yours.\n\n2.  Fat acceptance argues that people's health is between them in their doctor. You can't look at someone and tell the exact level of their health. Even if a person is unhealthy because of their size, it doesn't mean there so unhealthy they're about to drop dead any single second. The same way no two people with asthma are in the same place health wise. Unless you've been to medical school, nothing about a person's size tells you anything specific.\n\n3.  Fat acceptance says people have a right to feel perfectly fine in their bodies right now they don't have to be sitting around feeling miserable all the time or constantly on a diet. They don't at every moment need to be working to get down to a size that we can pretend means they're healthy even if we have no idea if it makes them healthy or if they got down to that size in a healthy way. \n\n4.  Fat acceptance says whatever you feel about your own health there are definite societal issues about how people treat fat bodies.  There are people who are not diagnosed with disease because bias in medicine means doctors won't even run tests, and will just declare them fat. It's people being discriminated against for jobs where fitness and weight don't matter. \n\n5.  Notice how none of the above things have anything to do with people not working with their medical professional on their overall health. Or arguing in any way against people doing what they feel they need to to get into a more healthy body.

Sorry.\n\nA lot of people think this about sport teams and in some cases it's true, but it's pretty exaggerated. At any college where sports are big enough to draw students, they operate largely by a separate budget. They aren't using booster money for academics (because they can't), the reverse is true as well for a large portion of the athletics budget. When you see a large budget expenditure for a facility, no one's mentioning how much donated from outside specifically for sports. Also, the reason championships (not having any old team) increases rankings is because it increases applications to the school. Schools don't care about a sports related bump in rank, they already got the applicants. \n\nFor administrators, there's a lot of reasons for the increase beyond bloat. One, some have salaries (and sometime entire department budgets) paid by grants like Title V.  Two, a lot are due to staff taking over duties that faculty (often) didn't do well. Either because they didn't have time, had too large a population, or just had no interest. Three, many are due to newly instituted rules to meet state mandate for funding.\n\nAnd honestly...everyone needs to acknowledge that students aren't just attracted by amenities, but that they actively demand them, and they have to be paid for. And many articles mention amenities instead of services for sensationalism. The student angry about health fees because they don't use the gym would be ticked to lose the free student health center doctor's appointments; not realizing that it's all the same fee.

Yes, their small amount of fame is why she wants them. But it also gives them a story line and a reason to keep them on the successful show. That editor already admitted to trying out episodes this season where main cast members don't show up at all. And did she really not sign anything or was that a story line for tv show drama? If it's real, a handshake deal that is caught on camera would hold up in court. Handshake deals are actually legally binding. The problem is usually proving them. If Lisa's goal was screwing them by not signing anything, she messed up when she let it get filmed so jokes on her. Hell, for all we know, there is a licensing deal in place and the whole \"owning a bar\" thing is bs.\n\nAnd I would rather own part of the bar. If Vanderpump Rules is cancelled, say, two seasons from now, all cast members are going to have their fame take a nose dive.
