In such cases, the polite form will often only come at the end of the sentence to show the overall level or politeness or formality.\n\nBe aware that Japanese speech levels are far more extensive than most European languages. In addition to casual and polite, we also have honorific and humble language. For example, the following all mean to eat.\n\n\u304f\u3046\u3000\u304f\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3000\u305f\u3079\u308b\u3000\u305f\u3079\u307e\u3059\u3000\u3081\u3057\u3042\u304c\u308b\u3000\u3081\u3057\u3042\u304c\u308a\u307e\u3059\u3000\u3044\u305f\u3060\u304f\u3000\u3044\u305f\u3060\u304d\u307e\u3059\n\n\u305f\u3079\u308b is the most basic word and it's polite form is \u305f\u3079\u307e\u3059\n\n\u304f\u3046 is a very casual word often used may males. It's polite form would be \u304f\u3044\u307e\u3059 but as you can imagine it is much less common than the \u304f\u3046 form because the word itself is very casual\n\n\u3081\u3057\u3042\u304c\u308b\u30fb \u3081\u3057\u3042\u304c\u308a\u307e\u3059 is the honorific forms used for talking with respect to or sometimes about someone especially important\n\n\u3044\u305f\u3060\u304f\u30fb\u3044\u305f\u3060\u304d\u307e\u3059 is the humble form used with reference to yourself before superiors. However it also means receive and is said before a meal among other situations.\n\nThere are also other options like \u305f\u3079\u3089\u308c\u308b\u30fb\u305f\u3079\u3089\u308c\u307e\u3059 which is passive (to get eaten) but can be used as a slightly less extreme version of \u3081\u3057\u3042\u304c\u308b\u30fb\u3081\u3057\u3042\u304c\u308a\u307e\u3059.\n\nAlso, be aware that politeness and formality are different. The casual form is often used in writing along with endings like \u3067\u3042\u308b and it is considered formal or stiff.\n\nSo, to start with, it is similar to du/Sie or tu/vous etc, but goes a but further than that.", "created_utc": "1649727295.0", "edited": "False", "id": "i4de5wt", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_u1msxl", "parent_id": "t3_u1msxl", "score": "3", "subreddit": "LearnJapanese", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qyls"}, {"author": "kusotare-san", "body": "Im pretty sure he means women who are twenty something years old", "created_utc": "1649688964.0", "edited": "False", "id": "i4auj3s", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_u19dtm", "parent_id": "t1_i4atn30", "score": "11", "subreddit": "justneckbeardthings", "subreddit_id": "t5_2xp02"}, {"author": "kusotare-san", "body": "This says you called out \"Ken\" to him.\n\nHow about \u30b1\u30f3\u3068\u3044\u3046\u540d\u524d\u3092\u3064\u3051\u305f", "created_utc": "1649644618.0", "edited": "False", "id": "i48u94a", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_u0ujzf", "parent_id": "t1_i48qeuo", "score": "3", "subreddit": "LearnJapanese", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qyls"}, {"author": "kusotare-san", "body": "Omfg I know right!?

Language is rarely structured in a certain way because it is necessary. If it were, all languages would essentially share the same characteristics; but they don't. Languages evolve based on their speakers and environment, and some languages like English have lost gender where it once existed.\n\nThe most logical answer for how words came to have genders in the first place is by extending the idea of gender in humans and other animals to objects and the words the represent them. \n\nThere are studies that show that gender also affects how people view those objects. In German bridge is a feminine word and studies show than people are more likely to use words like beautiful to describe a bridge in German than in languages where the word for bridge is masculine, in which case they might use \"strong\" or something. Whether the perception came first or the gender fame first, I'm not sure. But this associate is interesting nonetheless.\n\nHowever, other languages categories nouns in ways other than gender. Like Swahili. So, gender is probably just a very simple way of conceptualising categories for humans, and many languages that categories nouns (or other word classes) possibly originally use words that describe gender purely because it is easy and familiar.\n\nWhy are words categories? Well, humans like patterns. We like separating things into easy to understand groups and things that don't have a clear identity tend to be viewed as suspicious. Dangerous animals and friendly animals, edible plants and inedible plants, friend or foe, male or female.

The person in the post obviously has made statements to the effect that she finds gay sex to be disgusting, and fair enough OP was taken aback, as I would be too. This would be more of a problem if she said it directly to a gay person or deliberately within ear shot of a gay person or if, when meeting a gay person, treated them poorly. However, I'm not sure whether she has done those things. If she made comment to me and I said I disagree please keep your views to yourself, but she continued, then the friendship probably would not last long. \nIf you'll forgive the analogy, let's compare with paedophilia. A paedophile is most likely mentally ill. That is regrettable and provided keep there desires to themselves, they harm noone. Only once they act upon those desires does it become an open problem.
