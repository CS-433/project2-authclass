So he sets out to prove that he in fact is.\n\nHis mother has been chosen by Sune to be a high priestess because of her beauty that is known throughout the land and which is the topic of many a bard's poems.

During one session my character got carried away a bit. It was his first dungeon crawl and he lost sight of his inate goodness and started killing of baddies \"because they're just so f*ing ugly\".\n\nMy DM had him have a vision the next day. He was looking at his own reflection in a pond and the ripples in the water started to distort his face. Startled, he got up and looked around only to find a paladin in full armour charging towards him. Just before the paladin struck him he realised the paladin was himself shouting \" die, you ugly creature\". The blow of his own sword woke him up.\n\nSo yeah, maybe I am role-playing him well enough already, I guess? I think I could say the chaos is most prominent in his torment to balance between what's good and what is not. And this love for his goddess is fickle like a flame, it burns chaotically. And the more intensely it burns the more damage it does. \n\nAnd then he redeems by acts of love. Making generous donations to temples.

The forest thing they notice to get xp from is killing monsters (like in videogames). But that lead to them not paying attention WHATSOEVER in the story line of the campaign. So what I did was make clear to them that that's not the only way.\n\nI gave them xp for social encounters and solving a mystery. And I explicitly mentioned that they wouldn't have gotten that xp if they'd just hacked their way through. Then their playing style changed without me having to tell them to go and look out for clues.\n\nHowever... They still seem pretty thick... They don't put any dots together. I mean none... Zero... I've let them find a book telling about a cult worshipping the undead. I've had them go through a cave with an altar to Orcus, demon prince of the undead. I've thrown countless zombies and skeletons at them that seem to be drawn to an object they were ordered to bring to a mysterious guy. When they didn't, a really insanely scary necromancer dude came screaming into a village killing everyone because he needed said item.\n\nStill... No... Connection... At...

I've never seen it used personally and only heard of a couple groups ever using it in stories on Reddit.\n\nYes, I would definitely do this. That was actually the first thing I thought: \"Why is that still in there\". I don't even know normally what to fill in there. A plus? A 1? A yes? A check? It's never used. When I give my players inspiration I just hand them a d20.\n\n> Lining all of the circles up in one line across the top, probably in the order of: Proficiency Bonus, Passive Perception, Initiative, AC in the middle for dat sexy symmetry, Speed, Spell Save DC, Spell Attack\n\nCould be nice. But: 1) I'd switch initiative to be next to proficiency bonus, and 2) I do like having the attacks top right... So I'd have to see it to decide I guess.\n\n> Since that area where the bottom four circles are currently would be free, I'd probably use it to make the Attacks box front and center on the page. Swap it's current position with the Ammo box, Death Saves bar, and all of the HP stuff.\n\nOh wait, forget my last remark... I could actually see why this is better.\n\n> I'm considering changing the style of the Hit Dice, Temp HP, and HP boxes. Should I keep them as plain boxes or go with more stylized shapes? Heart, Shield, something-for-Hit-Dice? Can't really decide.\n\nI would certainly do that. And an additional suggestion: maybe swap current hitpoints with hitdice. I like having the most important stuff first. HOWEVER, when the health boxes are lined out to the right of the sheet, then it stands out more if it's on the far right.\n\n> If I keep them as normal boxes, should I change the Death Saves bar to something more plain and boxy?\n\nI really like the death save boxes! Don't change them! :)\n\n> I definitely want to make the borders of all the different sections match. I'll most likely change everything to the \"cut corners\" look of the Equipment box because it's the style the Stat boxes have and I don't feel like messing with the Stat boxes.\n\nYeah the equipment box looks most clean, so I agree.\n\n> I don't know what to do with that Notes section. Is there something better to put on the page instead of Notes?\n\nHmm... If you're going to make notes on your sheet, than you'll need more space. So I'd skip it from the sheet entirely and move that to a different page. Maybe whip up some kind of quest page... I always see players scribble stuff in the margins. I'd like to see a page with boxes for important plot points, NPCs, treasure, plans, etc... I'd rather put more room for equipment on the sheet.\n\ntldr: notes shouldn't be on front page\n\n> I had to stretch the Attacks box a bit and it made all of the wording inside of it a little weird if you look closely. It's small, but it bugs me, so I'll need to replace all of it with fresh text. Which ties in to my next point.\n\nYes, but in general the size of the box looks good. And there are enough attack options in there, which is nice.\n\n> I just typed Notes in instead of copying it from another sheet. It looks darker, might be a pixel different in size, and might even be a slightly different font. I can't really tell for sure, so I kind of want to go back and change the labeling of all the boxes. A couple of the labels are off anyway. \"Other Proficiencies & Languages\" will just be \"Profiencies\". \"Equipment\" will probably become \"Inventory\" or something.\n\nThis will probably not be a problem if you'd do it in acrobat. I have no experience with the program though... Wish I did.\n\n> I think that's everything I want to change about it for now. Any other ideas?\n\nYes...
