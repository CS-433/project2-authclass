The notion of the \"common good\" is touted as one of the major differences between Eastern and Western culture and you'll often hear it mentioned as one factor in what makes the East \"superior\" to the West but this is just common rhetoric and reality is anything but.  Since the cultural revolution when neighbor turned against neighbor, student against teacher, and child against parent, all notion of the \"common good\" went out the window.  It became a dog-eat-dog world and you do whatever you need to do to survive and get ahead.  The average Chinese person sees themselves in intense competition with 1.4 billion other people pretty much from the day that they are born.  Parents tell their children they need to get higher scores than their classmates if they ever want a chance at a better future and it keeps going from there.  This kind of worldview has huge ramifications for a coherent society.  People withhold information beneficial for everyone because they think it might give them an advantage somewhere down the line.  Relationships with others are only worth as much as they benefit you.  Those outside of your circle are not worth your time or attention because you have to focus on grinding 24/7 lest you fall behind.  They might even be faking it to try and get ahead at your expense.  If there's one thing I can say after being here so long it's that Chinese society is characterized by a huge lack of trust.

Let\u2019s break it down.  Why do we even live in society and subject ourselves to laws?  Because there\u2019s a general consensus that people have a better chance having their basic human rights realized under an authority system that protects those rights.  \n\nWhat are basic human rights?  Among others, the right to life and to the things needed to sustain life such as food, clothing, shelter, etc. The right to safety so you are not looking over your shoulder every 10 seconds, and the right to property, in other words the right to possession of the material goods that you exerted your labor to gain.  These are primal rights and they are to apply to everyone equally.  They predate history and society  by thousands of years.  The whole purpose of law is to ensure these rights are upheld.\n\nGet it?  A five-year-old would be able to see that all of the examples you\u2019ve mentioned violate peoples\u2019 basic rights or having those rights equally applied to them.  Therefore they cannot be considered real laws.  Real laws must meet the minimum requirement for justice, they are meaningless if they do not.  This is why societies do not have laws explicitly allowing for things like theft or murder.   These laws are also acceptable to disobey.  \n\nDamaging property in the form of fighting for a just cause is an unjust act because it violates the museums right to property.  They spent a huge amount of money to purchase or rent, then insure this piece of art so that it can be put on display.  Fighting for a just cause is a noble thing but it stops being so when you violate someone else\u2019s basic rights to do it.  The laws that were violated are there to protect basic rights to property and are therefore just laws.  Stage protests, boycott the museum, do whatever you want within reason to get them to stop their partnership, but you cannot violate rights to do so and nobody, least of all a judge, should be praising people for that kind of behavior.

That is in part because flagging economic prospects will take time to affect defense and in part because China has proven able to compete with fewer resources overall. China\u2019s\u00a0military spending\u00a0as a percentage of GDP has been decreasing since 2010, and the country has never spent more than 1.9 percent of GDP on national defense. (The United States spent 3.7 percent of GDP on defense in 2020.) For the last three decades, China\u2019s military spending has been a third of the United States\u2019. And yet, largely because it has focused on acquiring asymmetric capabilities and limited its military ambitions to Asia, it has built a military that can now defeat the United States in a conflict over Taiwan.\n\nAnd the future is bright for the People\u2019s Liberation Army. Although some of its modernization efforts remain unfinished,\u00a0the PLA has made significant progress\u00a0toward professionalizing its noncommissioned officer corps and hiring capable civilians to fulfill vital support roles. It is also recruiting more and more college graduates, improving its ability to conduct complex joint operations in a high-tech, information environment.\n\nOver the next ten years, China\u2019s ability to project power throughout Asia will grow. By 2030, it will have\u00a0four\u00a0aircraft carriers, a network and space infrastructure that enhances the connectivity and thus the lethality of its forces, ground- and space-based weaponry capable of threatening U.S. military and civilian satellite constellations, and an air force that can challenge U.S. air superiority in Asia. It will have more naval ships than the United States and a nuclear arsenal that is larger, more survivable, and better able to threaten targets around the globe thanks to Chinese advancements in hypersonics. Any remnants of U.S. military superiority in Asia, such as Washington\u2019s better submarine capabilities, are disappearing. China has invested heavily in developing so-called antisubmarine warfare capabilities, including\u00a0advanced helicopters\u00a0and\u00a0ship-based sonar systems\u00a0that will be ready for action in the next ten years.\n\nOf course, the U.S. military will not stand still as the PLA advances. The United States is building\u00a0resilient space infrastructure and capabilities. It plans to deploy intermediate-range ballistic missiles to the Indo-Pacific now that Washington is no longer bound by the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty. And it plans to add new unmanned ships as well as more manned ships to the U.S. naval fleet to counter China. Headlining these efforts is the Pacific Deterrence Initiative, a Pentagon plan to enhance U.S. competitiveness in the Indo-Pacific. In this its inaugural year, the PDI includes approximately $6 billion for new integrated command-and-control systems, drone capabilities, electronic warfare, F-35 fighters, ships to counter Chinese low-level aggression and provocation, and support systems and equipment for U.S. Marines and other ground forces.\n\nBut even with these investments, U.S. forces in the Indo-Pacific will have vulnerabilities that China can exploit for asymmetric advantage. For instance, the United States will be unable to defend its forward bases from Chinese missile attacks or its space assets from Chinese counterspace operations. Current procurement and acquisition plans reveal that in ten years, the United States will not have significantly more forces to deploy to the region than it has now. The U.S. Navy is modernizing, but it will not have its planned fleet of between 450 and 500 ships until 2045\u2014a fleet size that China will have in just ten years.\n\nAll of this suggests that China has not yet reached its position of maximal military advantage vis-\u00e0-vis the United States. It is telling that although Western scholars such as Brands and Beckley\u00a0suggest\u00a0that a relatively stagnant economy should influence Chinese leaders\u2019 strategic calculus, encouraging them to act now or lose their chance, there is no evidence of this line of thinking in Chinese political or military writings, according to textual analyses carried out by\u00a0natural language processing and analytics tools.\u00a0Indeed, most Chinese strategists are sanguine about China\u2019s future. As former Chinese diplomat Zhen Bingxi\u00a0wrote\u00a0in a journal published by the\u00a0People\u2019s Daily Press,\u00a0China is \u201cwell on its way to becoming a global superpower,\u201d even if it will continue to lag behind the United States in certain areas. Some Chinese media commentators have explicitly pushed back against American rhetoric about \u201cpeak China,\u201d\u00a0noting\u00a0that the country \u201chas long defied the pessimistic predictions of American media outlets and academia,\u201d as one journalist put it in a pro-Beijing Hong Kong media outlet.\n\nSome might dismiss these comments as predictable attempts to rebut a narrative of Chinese decline. But no authoritative Chinese military writings consider the argument that\u00a0China\u00a0needs to take Taiwan now because the window of opportunity is closing, even though Chinese security commentators regularly debate other sensitive topics such as the effectiveness of China\u2019s efforts at peaceful unification with Taiwan. Such writings suggest that Chinese leaders increasingly believe they could take Taiwan by force and that peaceful unification is not working. Xi\u2019s rhetoric, moreover, indicates that he may want to achieve unification to seal his legacy. Once he is confident that the PLA is ready, therefore, he may move swiftly to take Taiwan\u2014not because he will not have another chance but because the future is always uncertain.\n\nIf this is\u00a0Xi\u2019s\u00a0thinking, he is right. Even if its growth stagnates over the next decade, China will still likely be the world\u2019s second-largest economy. Any austerity measures instituted then would take many years to reach the military. And one thing is certain: China will be more capable militarily in 2035 than it is today.\n\nCONFIDENT CHINA, CAPABLE CHINA\n\nAn anxious China at the peak of its power and a confident China still on the military ascent can be expected to act in similar ways. Both will be more aggressive, especially when it comes to territorial issues such as\u00a0Taiwan. But these different motivations for Chinese aggression suggest different strategic responses from the United States: a peaking China will be the most dangerous over the next decade, whereas a still ascendant one will be a threat for much longer than that. The\u00a0United States\u00a0should be wary of short-term solutions that undermine its ability to compete in the long term and prepare equally for a war in 2027 and 2037.\n\nThere is a silver lining, however. A peaking power may fight to the death since it has only one chance to remake the international order. But a power that knows it will have more opportunities to get its way may be more willing to back down from a military confrontation that does not go as planned. For example, if Xi made a\u00a0move\u00a0for Taiwan and met resistance, he could still claim victory, perhaps after seizing an offshore island or merely after declaring that he has taught a lesson to \u201cseparatists\u201d in Taiwan and \u201cimperialists\u201d in the United States. A confident power is also less likely to be provoked into starting a war. Although it conducted concerning large-scale military exercises near Taiwan after U.S. Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi visited the island this month, China refrained from more aggressive actions\u2014intercepting Pelosi\u2019s aircraft, for instance\u2014that might have risked igniting a conflict. That may be because the best war for a confident China is one in which the PLA moves quickly against\u00a0Taiwan\u00a0and gives little warning to the United States.\n\nFor years to come, the United States is more likely to face a confident, capable China than an insecure, reckless one. Washington will not emerge victorious from this contest because Beijing steps out of the race, as Moscow did at the end of the Cold War. To secure its interests in Asia, therefore, the United States must prepare for a war with China, whether tomorrow or two decades down the road.", "created_utc": "1661503907.0", "edited": "1661504144.0", "id": "iluhmk0", "is_submitter": "True", "link_id": "t3_wy3xyu", "parent_id": "t1_iluhm51", "score": "2", "subreddit": "China", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh2v"}, {"author": "chimugukuru", "body": "As relations between the United States and China have spiraled down to a half-century low, a frightening new narrative has taken hold among some U.S. analysts and policymakers. It supposes that China\u2019s window of opportunity to \u201creunify\u201d Taiwan with the mainland\u2014one of Chinese President Xi Jinping\u2019s core foreign policy objectives\u2014is closing rapidly, intensifying the pressure on Beijing to act swiftly and forcefully while it still has the chance.\n\nThis narrative rests on the belief that China\u2019s rise is nearing its end. Unprecedented demographic decline, a heavy debt burden, uneven innovation, and other serious economic problems have slowed China\u2019s growth and are likely to slow it even further, leaving the country without the military power or political influence to challenge the United States. Beijing is aware of these headwinds, the thinking goes, and is therefore likely to act soon, before it is too late. As the scholars Hal Brands and Michael Beckley have\u00a0argued\u00a0in\u00a0Foreign Affairs, \u201cChina is tracing an arc that often ends in tragedy: a dizzying rise followed by the specter of a hard fall.\u201d In their view, it is now or never if China wants to redraw the world map.\n\nBut such analysis is misguided. True, China\u2019s economic ascent has slowed and will eventually reverse, impeding Beijing\u2019s military and political aspirations. But a \u201chard fall\u201d is not in the cards. Any decline from China\u2019s economic peak is likely to be gradual\u2014and possibly eased by heavy spending on research and development explicitly aimed at partially offsetting the country\u2019s demographic and debt-related woes. In fact, current income and defense spending trajectories suggest that China will have more resources to compete militarily with the United States over the next ten years than it has had over the last 20. As a result,\u00a0Beijing\u00a0will become more\u2014not less\u2014capable of projecting power while the United States will have difficulty countering Chinese military challenges in Asia. Far from a narrow window to achieve their geopolitical ambitions, then, China\u2019s leaders have space to bide their time.\n\nDEMOGRAPHY, NOT DESTINY\n\nDemographic decline all but guarantees China\u2019s eventual economic decline. But this process is likely to be gradual, not sudden, and the timing remains uncertain. China\u2019s labor force is probably shrinking and it will continue to shrink indefinitely because the population is\u00a0about to start shrinking, if it has not started to do so already. In 2021, Chinese birth rates fell to a record low. The median age in China is about half a year older than in the United States, and by 2042 it will be almost seven years older, or on a par with Japan today. China\u2019s population will decline more quickly later this century, falling by more than 200 million people by 2060, according to one UN projection. As this decline unfolds, genuine economic growth will be essentially impossible.\n\nBut even in the midst of this\u00a0demographic\u00a0contraction, China will be at worst the world\u2019s third-largest national economy, as it was in the first decade of this century but with wealth and technological abilities that are closer to those of the United States. More likely, China will be the second-largest economy in the world. For the rest of this decade and the next, a peaking population will not necessarily translate into a rapid economic decline. The dwindling of China\u2019s labor force has probably already been underway for a decade, but its economic growth has still outpaced that of the United States. No one believes that China\u2019s economic capabilities peaked in 2012 or, for that matter, in 2018. While labor force decline will eventually be a major problem for China, it is not clear when that will be. China\u2019s median age in 2032 is projected to be the same as the United States\u2019 in 2052.\u00a0If demography is destiny, the United States will have declined sharply by then, too. But in reality, the United States\u2019 economic health, like China\u2019s, depends on many other factors.\n\nOne of those factors is debt. Debt already weighs on Chinese growth, but the problem is chronic, not acute. Total Chinese credit to the nonfinancial sector has increased substantially over the last decade, starting mainly in response to the 2008\u20139 global financial crisis. As of the end of 2019, this measure of outstanding debt stood at 263 percent of GDP, slightly higher than the U.S. share of 255 percent. China has been more prudent during the\u00a0COVID-19\u00a0pandemic, but its debt burden could swell even larger as its population ages and it must care for a greater number of retirees. Still, the weight of China\u2019s debt will limit growth in a steady fashion, not causing a steep fall. As a result, China will have plenty of money on hand for military and related investments. According to the World Bank, China spent $6.2 trillion on infrastructure, land, and machinery in 2019\u2014$1.6 trillion more than the United States spent. U.S. capital is more productive than Chinese capital, but there is little doubt that even with its high debt burden China will have considerable resources at its disposal long into the future.\n\nAnother factor that will shape China\u2019s economic trajectory is innovation. As ever, the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s need for control will limit the pace of innovation. On that score, Xi\u2019s regime has not performed well. It has\u00a0attacked private technology firms\u00a0and generally\u00a0discouraged competition. But Beijing can afford to spend heavily on new technologies that will give it a moderate and enduring economic boost. According to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, China spent roughly $515 billion on research and development in 2019 while the United States spent $633 billion. China\u2019s R&D spending is likely to rise for the rest of the decade, even as its economy slows. Beijing will also continue to coerce the transfer of technology from private companies doing business in China or to steal it outright. With its current economic system, China cannot become a leading innovator, but it has already caught up to the rest of the world in key fields such as 5G telecommunications and energy storage. Maintaining technological parity with the United States in at least some important areas over the next two decades will be easier than it was to close the previous technological gap.", "created_utc": "1661503897.0", "edited": "False", "id": "iluhm51", "is_submitter": "True", "link_id": "t3_wy3xyu", "parent_id": "t3_wy3xyu", "score": "2", "subreddit": "China", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh2v"}, {"author": "chimugukuru", "body": "more like 80%", "created_utc": "1661420154.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ilpnia9", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_wx1pca", "parent_id": "t1_ilp1v9k", "score": "1", "subreddit": "China", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh2v"}, {"author": "chimugukuru", "body": "The toilet paper thing - I have never ever once done it (throw it in the trash can I mean).

That's absolute suicide.\n\nThere are a few things to keep in mind.\n\n1. Any CCP fantasy of invading Taiwan has been destroyed by the global response to the Ukraine invasion.  I do believe Putin and Xi had this plan in the works for a while and China is using Russia as an experiment to gauge global reaction.  If those same sanctions placed on Russia were ever placed on China it'd crumble in six months because of how dependent it is on oil and food imports.  Russia is able to weather them for the moment because they are mostly self-sustaining agriculturally.\n2.

Nobody on the politburo is sacrificing their personal wealth for ultranationalistic ideology.\n\nIf China was going to attack the US, and that's a very, very hypothetical situation, it'd be somewhere like Saipan or another place they deem to be small and not as important.

The CAS worries that China may not be able to afford such a large-scale construction of high-speed rail, and such a large scale high-speed rail network may not be practical.\n\nHigh-speed rail train runs at over 250 km per hour, about twice the normal speed of a regular train. Under the current plan, the central government has approved to build, by 2020, 16,000 km of high speed rail providing access to about 90% of the Chinese population. Some local media have reported recently that the recently enabled Wuhan \u2013 Guangzhou high-speed rail is currently running an average daily attendance of less than half capacity, while the newly opened Shanghai-Hangzhou high-speed rail attendance is even lower. The main reason for the high-speed rail low attendance is that fares are too high; the high-speed railway ticket prices are usually double or higher than normal train fares.\n\n**The report submitted by the Chinese Academy of Sciences said China\u2019s high-speed rail construction has caused debt that has already reached unsustainable levels.\"**", "created_utc": "1655909629.0", "edited": "False", "id": "idb7gy0", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_vhp5ys", "parent_id": "t1_idaxadf", "score": "1", "subreddit": "MURICA", "subreddit_id": "t5_2u28p"}, {"author": "chimugukuru", "body": "LOL go to Google and search.  50 reputable results will come up on the first page.", "created_utc": "1655909384.0", "edited": "False", "id": "idb6w9a", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_vhp5ys", "parent_id": "t1_idb2b55", "score": "1", "subreddit": "MURICA", "subreddit_id": "t5_2u28p"}, {"author": "chimugukuru", "body": "Mate, 5,000 RMB a month for charity work is super high especially for a uni grad.

The gf and I booked a trip to Osaka for Chinese New Year holiday in January 2020 right before the shit hit the fan.  Despite clearly stating on their website that our airline (ANA) would refund all flight tickets due to the pandemic, they flat out refused and even tried to blame ANA for it, saying the fault was on the airline's end.  Well I'm 1/2 Japanese and speak the language so I called the headquarters in Japan and told them WTF was going on, they said they had already refunded the tickets to the agency.  I basically was begging the woman to give me the agent's details since Qunar wouldn't budge, and she felt sorry for us and actually broke protocol by giving us the info.\n\nI traced the agency to some shady outfit in friggin' St. Lucia.  (This was the Qunar official agency mind you, not a 3rd party using their platform).  The gf kept calling official Chinese Qunar customer service every day for about two weeks, each time being put on hold for an hour or longer only be told basically \"sorry, tough shit.\"  She was searching around on Weibo and found a lot of comments by people going through the exact same thing and joined a wechat group.   Of the 400+ people in the group, only two were successfully able to get a refund because they were recording the conversation with customer service on speaker and got the agent to admit  the policy out loud.  They are trained not to do this but occasionally will slip, especially if they're being yelled at.  We tried the same strategy and finally on the gazillionth time the bitch on the other end screwed up.  Got the money back (8K) within two hours.\n\nTLDR:  Qunar is a scumbag company who tried to profit off the pandemic by pocketing the refund money from the airlines and not giving it back to the customers.

If you don't or cant, you shouldn't be naturalized and should go back to where you came from.

While previously the government allowed these benefits to be mostly deducted to attract more foreign talent, that will not be the case beginning next year.\n\nTo give a simple example, if someone made an annual salary of 500,000 RMB and their child's education cost 200,000 per year, they would have been able to get that education deducted.  Their taxable income in 2020 would have been 500,000 per year.  Next year this cap will be removed, so their taxable income is now 700,000 RMB instead of 500,000, minus the standard deductions already in place for locals (education is around 2,000 deduction per month I believe).  Of course, getting taxed on slightly under 700K results in a big pay cut compared to getting taxed on 500K, so that is where the loss will occur.\n\nIf you have lots of benefits besides education you'll have to factor in the costs for all of these in order to get your total annual taxable income.  If your job gives you no extra benefits then you won't see any change in your tax rate.\n\nThere have been a lot of people saying this is a thinly veiled message for all foreigners to GTFO, but I think it's an overreaction.

I\u2019ve been here since it started (took a short Xmas trip home December 2019 and came back early January) and was kind of watching in horror how Ige and co. were completely botching everything up trying to handle it in Hawaii.

You may be mixing things up too much in the food processor.  The fat in the biscuits needs to be in visible pieces and not incorporated into the flour; this is what gives the biscuits their flakiness.  After lots trial and error these are the tips I find most useful.\n\n1. Start with very, very cold ingredients.  Mix the dry ingredients and sift them and put the whole bowl in the freezer for 10-15 minutes.  The colder the ingredients are, the less chance of your fat melting while incorporating everything together.  Get your fat cold, almost frozen, then cut into small pieces the size of diced frozen carrots.\n2. Get your dry ingredients out of the freezer and put the diced fat in.  Massage the pieces and break them up gently between your fingers, incorporating them into the mix but not fully.  Put this back in the freezer again another 10 minutes.\n3. Pour in the (very cold) buttermilk.  Mix with a wooden spoon very gently until just combined.  Dump the dough onto a lightly floured surface and pat it out very gently into a 1-inch thick flat circle.  This step is very important, don't roll it!  You should be able to see the pieces of fat in the dough.  Fold the dough onto itself like folding a paper into thirds and pat down again to the same thickness.  Cut with a sharp biscuit cutter and don't twist when cutting.  If done correctly you should be able to see the multiple layers in the biscuit at this point.  These layers are what will puff up and become flaky in the oven.\n\nI can't emphasize enough how little the dough should be handled.  There's really no mixing or rolling involved, just incorporating and patting it out.  Alton Brown's video really helped out with this and in it you can see how little his granny messes with the dough (link below).  Follow these tips and you should have yourself some nice biscuits.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHD\\_\\_HkfexY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHD__HkfexY)", "created_utc": "1638019645.0", "edited": "1638020155.0", "id": "hm9sjkl", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_r3cnoe", "parent_id": "t3_r3cnoe", "score": "58", "subreddit": "AskCulinary", "subreddit_id": "t5_2t82m"}, {"author": "chimugukuru", "body": "It would be about right now that foreigners have to pay social security.", "created_utc": "1638001303.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hm95p5k", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_r350qf", "parent_id": "t1_hm8rs0m", "score": "3", "subreddit": "shanghai", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qyu0"}, {"author": "chimugukuru", "body": "To be honest this sounds like a really bad deal.", "created_utc": "1638001272.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hm95nrs", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_r350qf", "parent_id": "t1_hm8rjbg", "score": "8", "subreddit": "shanghai", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qyu0"}, {"author": "chimugukuru", "body": "You can try a lawyer at first.

Like I mentioned above, they're more different from each other than Spanish is from Italian, maybe more like Spanish and Romanian.\n\nBoth descend from older versions of Chinese but though Mandarin is the official language of most of the Chinese-speaking world today, Cantonese is actually closer to older Chinese because it preserves more of the tones and final consonants in syllables.  This is because Mandarin phonology is heavily influenced by the non-Chinese Mongolic, Turkic, and Tungusic peoples that were always mixing with and/or invading northern China.\n\nThere are linguistic structures that differ between the two but speakers of both can read the same newspaper.  However, this is not actually because the writing system accurately reflects the spoken language, as Cantonese speakers have to function in a state of diglossia in which they might say something one way, but write or read it in an official standardized form which is much closer to Mandarin.  The difference is not just a matter of vocabulary and register but structurally as well.

It'd be hilarious if it wasn't screwing so many people over because they'd never qualify for a visa.\n\nWhy does the Aussie government require English proficiency tests?

I'm talking going to movies, restaurants that are 100% packed to the brim with hundreds and people are waiting outside for a table, flying on planes, trains and taking public transport with no problem at all.  \n\nAll schools are all back in session with all students in classrooms, where 50+ to a room is common here (albeit with daily temperature checks at the gate).  When I walk down the street, except for the fact everyone is wearing masks it looks much the same as it did a year ago.  Honestly, reading the news every day about what's going on back home and in the rest of the world it feels like a different universe.  We got to this point at a cost, though.\n\n\\- Like you said, everything was shut down completely from the end of January to mid-March, and after that there was even a partial shut down until mid-April (only essential workers out and theaters/restaurants/museums/any other indoor gathering place still closed.)  I did not leave my residential complex for 62 days in total and during that time only went out of my apartment every couple of days to throw away trash and pick up my groceries at the gate (can get them delivered here).  I didn't feel comfortable going out recreationally until the beginning of May (I'm a bit of a hypochondriac)\n\n\\- Of course, Big Brother is always watching here.  Whatever cons that system brings it has at least made contact tracing extremely efficient.  You use your phone here for everything from paying for groceries to ordering plane and train tickets.  Since your phone number is connected to your govt ID (or passport # for foreigners), if you were sat anywhere near an infected person on a plane/train/bus or made a purchase at a place where a case was traced back to, you'll be getting a phone call or they will be knocking at your door within 1/2 an hour.  There's no such thing as home quarantine here.  If you're infected or even suspected you're taken to a hotel where you stay until you're either sent to the hospital or test negative at least three times over multiple days.\n\n\\- The border has been shut to all foreigners since the end of March, though they are slowly relaxing restrictions for select individuals.  Everyone who does return, whether you are a local, foreigner, or diplomat is taken immediately from the airport to a quarantine hotel where they remain for two weeks and until they test negative.  You're not allowed to leave the room for any reason.  Food and other necessities are delivered in a sealed package to your door.  You can't come out to get it until the deliverer is gone (they'll call your room phone.)\n\nSo it really comes down to three things.  1) The initial shut down where we all played our part 2) quick and efficient contact tracing and 3) closing the borders and letting people back into the city only after they've quarantined two weeks and tested negative.", "created_utc": "1600254126.0", "edited": "False", "id": "g5gkcjj", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_itjysy", "parent_id": "t1_g5f79bh", "score": "15", "subreddit": "Hawaii", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qi3u"}, {"author": "chimugukuru", "body": "Enoki mushrooms, known as \"golden needle mushrooms\" \u91d1\u9488\u83c7 in Chinese.

He pours in 60% of total water weight in 30 seconds after bloom (1:15).  The rest of the water gets poured in in the next 30 seconds.  Your pouring is done by 1:45.  Pouring these amounts in that amount of time creates the right level of churn and room for the coffee grounds to move around in the water to extract the best flavor.\n3. He does one quick stir with a spoon and then another quick swirl towards the end.  This keeps the coffee grounds from sticking to the sides on the way down.  (If they do stick to the sides you'll lose some flavor because they won't fully extract).\n4.

It really clears things up.  Now when I think about it, I guess when using *estar* with people or objects, they are always things that can move or be moved and the place where they are located at that moment doesn't really define or characterize them.  Even a more permanent fixture like a painting on a wall wasn't always there and has the possibility of moving somewhere else in the future.\n\nAn event like a party or a storm, no matter how short-lived it may be in the grand scheme of things, doesn't really exist anywhere else outside the place where it is, and its location might define or distinguish it in a sense.  Though English doesn't make this distinction, an example I can think of off the top of my head is the Great Chicago Fire of 1871.

I know a lot of places in China have it but I think the Jiangxi version is the best.  I also like those soups they have in Nanchang that are served in the little jars.  In Fuzhou, the small city where I lived that was not far from Nanchang, there were a lot of freshwater fish dishes that were really good.  Also a big fan of those savory meat braised dishes like beer duck and stewed pig's trotter.\n\nI think I also just like that rustic, simple style of cooking.  I did my fair share of Chinese cooking before living there so I was familiar with all the common seasonings like oyster sauce, zhejiang vinegar, soy sauces, etc.  When I was observing my friend's mom who was the sole cook of the restaurant they operated out of the first floor of their home, I was really surprised that a lot of those ingredients weren't present in the dishes.  More often than not, aside from the spiciness it was just salt and a touch of light soy sauce that flavored things up.  I don't even recall her ever having vinegar in the kitchen but her trademark touch with almost every dish was a small addition of salted pickled chiles in baijiu as a garnish.  She taught me how to make it and I always have a jar around the house.\n\nThere is a woman from Jiangxi on Youku that does cooking videos of these exact kinds of dishes.

Yeah, the source is crappy. Regardless of the source I am simply disagreeing with your notion that China is more diverse. That is simply not true.  There is no way around that.

That's comparing apples and oranges and is faulty logic.  The only way to compare them fairly would be to look at the amount of actual ethnic groups regardless of how a government defines them.\n\nMy point is that China and the US define ethnic group differently (I think we at least agree here) so you cannot say that China is more diverse unless you are using the same category to define what an ethnic group is.\n\nIf China used the same categories to divide ethnicity as the US does, then my point still stands.  99% of them would be classified as Asian except for Russians and a few others.

That is an indisputable fact.\n\nP.S. If you want to go solely by the category of government recognition, the seven groups you are referring to is how the US Census defines ethnic groups.

If you read the passage carefully and put it in context with the rest of the book and the time the events described occurred you will find it's not explicit at all.\n\nPaul was condemning the Corinthian church for gathering for the wrong reasons.  When they gathered for the Lord's Supper, their hearts were not in the right place.  They were gathering simply to eat, were being selfish by only being concerned with themselves and ignoring the hungry, and sinning by being drunk.  Paul's point in verse 22 is that if they were gathering only to eat, they might as well stay home and eat there.  It's the classic example of outward 'obedience' but inward rebellion.\n\nIn short, this passage is *descriptive*, not *prescriptive*.  It does not in any way explicitly state or even imply that people must be physically gathered to have communion.  Of course, this issue wouldn't have even been considered during that time because the only way to have communion was to physically gather together.\n\nI would argue this passage actually supports the view that communion can be done online, as Paul makes it clear that doing it properly is more of a heart issue rather than going through the 'proper' motions.\n\nPhysically being together for the Lord's Supper is undoubtedly the most ideal situation.  But as far as Scripture is concerned, there is nothing that states this is a requirement and the only way to do it.  Concerning communion, we are commanded to do it in remembrance of what Jesus did, and to do it in a worthy manner.  Beyond that there are no requirements in regards to the method, the frequency, or how many people are required to gather to make it a 'legitimate' Lord's Supper.  When Scripture is not explicit, Christian liberty comes into play.  We are take the whole counsel of Scripture and pray to the Lord for guidance when we are unsure how to proceed.\n\nIn these times, when it is clear religious gatherings such as church services in Louisiana and the mega-cult in South Korea were responsible for the infections of thousands of people and the deaths of many of those,    I would argue that it is sinful for believers to gather unnecessarily for any reason, sacred or secular.

I do make a distinction between Hawaiian (nationality) and k\u0101naka maoli (native Hawaiian ethnicity).  There were Hawaiian citizens of the Kingdom of Hawai\u02bbi belonging to many ethnicities before it was annexed and they were fluent in the language.  Of course k\u0101naka maoli at that time viewed the language as theirs and Hawai\u02bbi's, though they never viewed it solely as their own.  You can only be k\u0101naka through blood but someone of any ethnicity can be Hawaiian.\n2. All the non-k\u0101naka maoli I know who have knowledge of the language are much more in tune with the culture than those born and raised in Hawai\u02bbi with no knowledge.  Once you know things like the names of the winds and the rains in the area where you live, you become much more appreciative and feel more connected to the land on which you were born and live.  If all in Hawai\u02bbi were encouraged to learn it I think there would be a much more unified Hawaiian identity among residents.  This would actually help political causes that many k\u0101naka believe in.\n3. There are many non-k\u0101naka all over the world who now practice aspects of Hawaiian culture such as the hula.   There are halau in Japan,  the USA, Europe and many other places, with many of them being extremely reverent to its origins and protocols.  If others can learn hula, why not the language?  In fact, a lot of people say they only learned about Hawai\u02bbi's history and struggles after something like a hula performance or a slack-key guitar piece piqued their interest and made them do some research.  I say spread Hawaiian far and wide!\n4. Non-k\u0101naka language experts have contributed greatly to the advancement and preservation of Hawaiian.  When I think of what it would be like without people like Pila Wilson and Puakea Nogelmeier, we would lack years of the research and contributions they have made.  Limiting the language to just k\u0101naka inhibits and at the very least greatly slows down new research on it.  Two minds are better than one.\n\nOf course, true cultural appropriation is never good.  I mean, if someone was learning it solely to make money from it in some way and did not try to engage with the cultural aspect (which is essential to learning any language) I would have an issue with that, but if people are coming from a place of genuine interest and respect I think it should be encouraged.", "created_utc": "1586931605.0", "edited": "1586948844.0", "id": "fnggmd5", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_g1euzl", "parent_id": "t1_fng43s1", "score": "9", "subreddit": "linguistics", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhos"}, {"author": "chimugukuru", "body": "I can find it supermarkets here, though I've never tried it.
