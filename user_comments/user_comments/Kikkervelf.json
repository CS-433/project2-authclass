Learn the words in both directions. Use your course book to know what vocabulary you should learn, in what order. Your book should have texts that are easy to read, but slowly increase in difficulty. When you are A2 or B1, maybe you can find graded readers. Once you are in your last book, you should be able to read comics and stuff like Harry Potter. Add useful words from those to Anki. They will be easy to remember.\n\n* Listen to French YouTube videos for learners. Always try to listen to stuff that you can at least understand somewhat, otherwise you are wasting your time. Once you are B1, you should be able to understand Flapacha, o\u00f9 es-tu on YouTube. That cartoon will help a lot.

Danish and Swedish also have just two genders and they're cool.\n\nCan I make a guess? Something tells me you don't use the pass\u00e9 simple in spoken French. It's easy to be a taalnazi in your mother tongue towards native speakers, but vice versa it's another story. Learning a language is **hard**. Students can learn the 3 genders if they want to, but don't tell them they should. Or at least be honest. You can't hear that someone is \"American\" or \"foreign\" because they don't use 3 genders. I find it more important that they learn Dutch word order correctly.\n\n>Additionally because the standard distinguishes them\n\nWell, yes and no. The standard language only makes the distinction for pronouns (hij/zij, hem/haar), which is incredibly unnatural and fake. The current standard is a compromise that nobody speaks naturally. You can only speak like that if you grew up with a dialect.\n\nNobody on NOS even uses hij/zij and hem/haar correctly anymore, so from a descriptivist point of view, the distinction is lost even in the standard language.\n\n>we absolutely do learn it in school.\n\nWell, we never did. We never learned about masculine and feminine words in Dutch class. Only in French, German and Latin class.\n\n>What I find interesting to hear though, is that you say that you lot use een/e, but not nen? I know of dialects that use ne(n)/een, but didn\u2019t know of een/e. I\u2019m from a ne(n)/een/e area btw.\n\nAll of Flanders is a ne/nen/een/e area, but people that avoid ne and nen end up with just een and e.\n\n>Even if you don\u2019t know if they\u2019re masculine or feminine, surely you must know to distinguish them from neuter?\n\nOf course, I never said otherwise. The de/het distinction is still strong.\n\nHowever, the die/dat distinction is in rapid decline. It is completely lost in West-Flanders and East-Flanders. I work there now and I have never heard anyone from that region say die/dat correctly. \"Het meisje die\", \"die programma\" etc. When I point it out, people become defensive and say \"I would never say that, you just misheard\". Yeah sure, I mishear the same thing a million times and so do linguists /s. There are now also many people from Vlaams-Brabant and Antwerpen who confuse these words. It is also happening in the Netherlands. Only Limburg is \"safe\" for now. Although I try to have a descriptivist mindset, it does itch because die/dat is the only useful thing left about grammatical gender in Dutch. Het schilderij van de appel die refers to the apple, het schilderij van de appel dat refers to the painting. Without die/dat, grammatical gender is just useless. And I know that language features don't have to be useful, but yeah, it just \"feels\" super wrong. The die/dat distinction won't survive this century. My father has unconsciously started talking like this, even though he is a taalnazi who has always been against it.\n\nBut let's look even further into the future. (Since you're so afraid that Dutch will look like English?) When you read a book about language evolution, one thing that often comes up is that schwas will drop. It's not a matter of **if,** it's a matter of **when**. But nearly all suffixes in Dutch have schwa! Grammar will change massively:\n\n(\"future Dutch\") Ik loop, jij loopt, hij/zij/het loopt, wij loop, jullie loop, zij loop (Afrikaans verb conjugation is even simpler)\n\n(\"future Dutch\") \u00e9\u00e9n boek, twee boek\n\nOf course, this still sounds super wrong, but given enough time, it will happen.\n\nFrench and the Scandinavian languages also have lots of nouns that sound the same in the plural, no worries. Chinese and Indonesian don't even have plurals.\n\nSo what I am saying is: our language is becoming more analytic. This is true for all Germanic languages except Icelandic and Faroese. German is a little bit \"behind\", but is also a lot more analytic than it used to be. You might think that English is \"leading\" this trend, but that is not necessarily true. For instance, Standard English verb conjugation is less analytic than Norwegian or Danish verb conjugation. There is a dialect of Danish that lost all grammatical genders, just like English did. (Danish uses en (masculine/feminine) and et (neuter), West Jutlandic uses en for countable nouns and et for uncountable nouns, which I find genius! Neuter nouns indeed tend to be uncountable!)", "created_utc": "1660066108.0", "edited": "1660066528.0", "id": "ijltj3e", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_wj87qt", "parent_id": "t1_ijlb7sz", "score": "1", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "Kikkervelf", "body": "In the Southern part of the Netherlands, people sometimes say ne in front of feminine or neuter words. This is called hyperdialect: people want to keep the local dialect, know that it has ne, but don't know how it works. Ne kind, ne vrouw... => This sounds horrible to Flemings.\n\nI am Flemish and I also don't know for every de word if it is masculine or feminine. Some words are obvious: nen dag, ne man, ne jonge, nen auto, een vrouw, een koe, een kip, nen haan, nen hond, een kat, nen aap.

Ideally there should be redundancy, so two words for each pattern, so 186 cards. You don't need to make all of these cards in a day. You can do 2 words a day (so make 12 to 14 cards a day) and that will take you 2 weeks. You can already start using Anki even if you haven't made all cards yet.\n\n**What should the cards look like?**\n\nAdd sentences or phrases to the card. Even if you already know the meaning of the cases, it will still be better to do that.\n\nFor example:\n\n*FRONT: the cover of the book -  \u03b5\u03be\u03ce\u03c6\u03c5\u03bb\u03bb\u03bf ...*\n\n*ANSWER: \u03b5\u03be\u03ce\u03c6\u03c5\u03bb\u03bb\u03bf \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u03b2\u03b9\u03b2\u03bb\u03af\u03bf\u03c5*\n\n*FRONT: the lion eats the child - \u03a4\u03bf \u03bb\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd\u03c4\u03ac\u03c1\u03b9 \u03c4\u03c1\u03ce\u03b5\u03b9 ...*\n\n*ANSWER: \u03a4\u03bf \u03bb\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd\u03c4\u03ac\u03c1\u03b9 \u03c4\u03c1\u03ce\u03b5\u03b9 \u03c4\u03bf \u03c0\u03b1\u03b9\u03b4\u03af*\n\n(I used Google Translate so take these translations with a grain of salt)\n\n**Should I only use Anki?**\n\nFor me personally, it helped with Latin to read the declension tables regularly and then try to chant them without looking. The order in which you chant is important. Always chant word by word (for example: \u03bc\u03ac\u03c7\u03b7, \u03bc\u03ac\u03c7\u03b7\u03c2, \u03bc\u03ac\u03c7\u03b7, \u03bc\u03ac\u03c7\u03b7, \u03bc\u03ac\u03c7\u03b5\u03c2, \u03bc\u03b1\u03c7\u03ce\u03bd, \u03bc\u03ac\u03c7\u03b5\u03c2), don't chant case by case (which is what I used to do when I first started with Latin).", "created_utc": "1658075009.0", "edited": "1658075923.0", "id": "igj6ur1", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_w16rrj", "parent_id": "t3_w16rrj", "score": "2", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "Kikkervelf", "body": "You just explained how every language in Europe is like...", "created_utc": "1658052025.0", "edited": "False", "id": "igi2mrn", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_w0oyp2", "parent_id": "t1_ighpd7h", "score": "3", "subreddit": "MapPorn", "subreddit_id": "t5_2si92"}, {"author": "Kikkervelf", "body": "English and Romanian are the exceptions here.

Maar **bewust** wil je er wel gewoon door zijn natuurlijk. Dus wat doe je? Je leert en leert en leert... tot het examen eraan komt en dan word je lui en verpest je alles. Onbewust is het idee om n\u00f3g maar weer eens te falen zo erg dat je eigenlijk liever niets doet. Want als je niet geleerd hebt en buist, dan heb je niet gefaald. Dat is geen deuk in je ego. \"Ja maar ik was geslaagd geweest als ik geleerd had. Ik ben niet dom\" Dit is hoe mensen onbewust denken, helaas.\n\nIk zat in hetzelfde schuitje op het eind van m'n bachelor en ben er niet uit geraakt zonder professionele hulp. (Gotta be honest here) Ondertussen toch mooi afgestudeerd. Toch geef ik jou nu even tips voor de komende twee dagen...\n\n1. Stop met piekeren over de toekomst en over hoe slecht je de laatste dagen geleerd hebt. Je kan n\u00e1 je examen nog genoeg piekeren. (gemakkelijker gezegd dan gedaan) Je kan echt \u00e9norm veel tijd verspillen met negatieve gedachten en die tijd heb je de komende twee dagen niet.\n2. Twee dagen zijn kort. Verspil het niet met Reddit of andere online zooi. Voor wiskunde heb je g\u00e9\u00e9n internet nodig. Weg die gsm, weg die laptop. Indien je je laptop \u00e9cht nodig hebt, zorg dan dat er Cold Turkey op staat. Blokkeer alle waardeloze websites tot en met maandagmiddag. Je kan toch wel zonder sociale media voor ocharme twee daagjes?\n3. Wanneer is een normaal uur voor jou om op te staan en te gaan slapen? Schrijf dat op. Da's niet per se hetzelfde als wat jouw ouders zouden willen. bv. 11:00 - 00:30 (ik weet niet meer hoeveel een tiener slaapt maar bon). Het laatste half uur van de dag moet je zeker niet leren, dan slaap je slecht. Splits zowel zaterdag als zondag op in twee. Dus dan heb je dit weekend **vier** blokken van 6,5 uur.\n4. Splits je vak op in **vier** delen. Zorg dat je zaterdag om 17:30 klaar bent met deel 1/4. Als je vroeger klaar bent met deel 1/4, dan kan je pauze nemen. Zaterdag om 00:00 moet je klaar zijn met deel 2/4 etc.\n5. Voor mensen met onbewuste faalangst zijn pauzes nu eenmaal \"gevaarlijk\". Voor je het weet loopt je pauze uren uit. Dus neem beter korte pauzes. Pauzes zijn gemaakt om te rusten en hoeven niet per se fantastisch te zijn. Masturberen is een goede pauze omdat het niet te lang duurt en oplucht. De straat een keer afwandelen en aan niets denken is ook goed. Slecht idee: gamen, een spannende aflevering kijken van een vervolgserie, een hoofdstuk uit een spannend boek lezen etc. Neem korte pauzes waar je echt efkes van bekomt.\n6. Het is wiskunde dus maak oefeningen en blijf oefenen. Niet gewoon lezen. Denk niet te veel: \"Ja maar dat kan ik nog wel, skip\". Van die mentaliteit krijg je spijt. Bovendien werkt het correct oplossen van oefeningen motiverend.\n7. \"Ja maar ik voel me zo slecht nu\" is geen reden om niet verder te studeren. Je kan je heus wel twee daagjes slecht voelen, daar ga je niet dood van! Bovendien verdwijnt het slechte gevoel vanzelf als je je eenmaal focust. (=> deze tip hielp bij mij het best)\n8. Go, go, go, go, go! Je hebt een heel semester zo je best gedaan. Dat hoeft niet allemaal voor niets te zijn. Je hebt jezelf de kans gegeven om te slagen.
