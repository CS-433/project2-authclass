For the *ir* verbs, you change *es* to *\u00eds*. So instead of *subes*, you'd say *sub\u00eds*. For the imperative of *vos*, you simply remove the *s*.

Forming the *vos* subjunctive is very similar to the standard; all you do is switch *ar* endings to *er* endings, and *er/ir* endings to *ar*. Examples are *no habl\u00e9s*, *no com\u00e1s*. The subjunctive is not really as standardized, so to speak, as the other two forms of *vos* verbs.

Blizzard themselves acknowledged this and nerfed her, but not until she made her rounds for *months*. Shortly after that came GOATS which wouldn't have been possible without Brigitte's existence. GOATS was such a major problem that Blizzard created the 2-2-2 locked role queue as the answer for it.

And now just recently Blizzard's latest patch has gimped main tanks, causing the meta to now shift to double off tank (Roadhog and D.Va), at least at the highest level.
