Local elections and governments exist, though. At this point your last argument is sufficiently dismantled. \n\nOk now for the spanish civil war. Here are three [quotes](https://www.communistvoice.org/10cSpanishCivil.html) that explain this well enough. \n\nThe collectives failed\n> It's not that the collectives were a failure in themselves. Just prior to and during the Civil War, large numbers of toilers rose up to take over the agrarian communities in some regions of Spain and workplaces in Barcelona and some other cities. Some collectives and cooperatives worked well, some didn't, and some were even imposed on the toilers. But all in all, this was the masses starting to take things into their own hands, and they showed that they could continue production in their workplaces without the whip of the big landlords and bloated parasites. The taking over of the individual workplaces and communities is one step in a revolutionary process. But there is yet more that must be done -- the workplaces and communities must be integrated into an overall economy. A vast organizational task faces the oppressed masses who are rising up to eliminate the old exploiting system, but anarchist theory just brushes aside this problem -- coordination between collective would supposedly be easily accomplished by \"mutual aid\" or \"voluntary cooperation\" or, if absolutely need be, by the weakest possible federation. The anarchist theory was then, as now, allergic to centralism and central planning. The anarchists didn't and don't understand that a new centralism -- compatible with and requiring the initiative of the workers at the base -- has to be built up if capitalism is to be overcome. For them, democracy at the base and centralism are incompatible; they identify centralism with tyranny; and when they talked about \"self-management\" they meant collectives that are autonomous and independent. Faced with the need for coordination and planning and class-wide action in the Spanish Civil War, the anarchists were in a quandary. They ended up adopting more and more of the plans of their opponents, such as the reformist socialists, the Stalinists (fake communists), and the liberal bourgeoisie. Grumbling and stumbling, the anarchists accepted these plans, not just as a compromise, but because they had no independent idea about how to accomplish the needed centralism. They didn't know how to counterpose revolutionary centralism and class-wide consciousness to the bureaucracy of the reformists, Stalinists and liberal bourgeoisie.\n\nThey failed to abolish money \n> . Thus having begun by abolishing money, the local committee of the autonomous commune proceeded to issue local coupons that functioned as local money.(7) It didn't strike the anarchists to consider whether their local coupons served the role of money. For the anarchists, money only meant the hated national banknotes, while local currency was not -- in their eyes -- money at all. Meanwhile the necessity for the collective to deal with other collectives, and as well to provide money to peasants visiting other parts of Spain, resulted in a patchwork system. According to Miller, the inconvenience of this system resulted in the \"growing belief, in anarchist circles, that a uniform national currency was after all a good thing.\"\n\nThey also failed to abolish governance\n > Take the villages. The anarchist version of the abolition of money resulted in the local village committee issuing coupons, running various social services (barber shop, apothecaries, etc.), determining the conditions of work, etc. This actually increased the role of the local committee. As one source points out, in the midst of praising the agrarian collectives: \". . .

It regards all things in the universe, their forms and their species, as eternally isolated from one another and immutable. Such change as there is can only be an increase or decrease in quantity or a change of place. Moreover, the cause of such an increase or decrease or change of place is not inside things but outside them, that is, the motive force is external. Metaphysicians hold that all the different kinds of things in the universe and all their characteristics have been the same ever since they first came into being. All subsequent changes have simply been increases or decreases in quantity. They contend that a thing can only keep on repeating itself as the same kind of thing and cannot change into anything different. In their opinion, capitalist exploitation, capitalist competition, the individualist ideology of capitalist society, and so on, can all be found in ancient slave society, or even in primitive society, and will exist for ever unchanged. They ascribe the causes of social development to factors external to society, such as geography and climate. They search in an over-simplified way outside a thing for the causes of its development, and they deny the theory of materialist dialectics which holds that development arises from the contradictions inside a thing. Consequently they can explain neither the qualitative diversity of things, nor the phenomenon of one quality changing into another. In Europe, this mode of thinking existed as mechanical materialism in the 17th and 18th centuries and as vulgar evolutionism at the end of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th centuries. In China, there was the metaphysical thinking exemplified in the saying \"Heaven changeth not, likewise the Tao changeth not\", [4] and it was supported by the decadent feudal ruling classes for a long time. Mechanical materialism and vulgar evolutionism, which were imported from Europe in the last hundred years, are supported by the bourgeoisie.\nAs opposed to the metaphysical world outlook, the world outlook of materialist dialectics holds that in order to understand the development of a thing we should study it internally and in its relations with other things; in other words, the development of things should be seen as their internal and necessary self-movement\n\n- Mao in On Contradiction", "created_utc": "1652623582.0", "edited": "False", "id": "i8p3opj", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_upi4lh", "parent_id": "t1_i8lqwb4", "score": "1", "subreddit": "sendinthetanks", "subreddit_id": "t5_2h3mvj"}, {"author": "Elucidate137", "body": "[here\u2019s](https://www.jstor.org/stable/4365254?seq=2) a great little 4 page pamphlet talking about how the Soviet Union tended towards capitalism after Stalin.

This can be seen in Nazi Germany, in which corporate profits rose (even during the depresssion) whilst the living standards of the everyday person dramatically dropped. In Nazi Germany, huge corporate bailouts occurred, and many solvent state-owned industries were privatized. In this, while landowners and industrialists raised prices and slashed wages, the state increased taxes on the public and decreased it in corporate entities , and even inheritance taxes were greatly reduced or altogether abolished. Modest wages were cut in Germany by 25-40 percent and in Italy by 50%, child labour was also reintroduced in Italy. \n\nIn both countries, while state employment as a result of massively enlarged arms industries and corporations altogether increased, poverty also increased.\n\nLet\u2019s compare this to communism, in which the entire premise is to put capital and the state into the hands of the proletariat: the exact opposite of fascism. In addition, rather than shifting burdens onto the working class, as was the case with Nazi Germany and fascist Italy, socialist projects have relieved it. In soviet Russia, for example, collectivisation and worker co-ops were hugely successful with massive waves of them occurring due to state encouragement (they offered equipment, grain, and money to newly collectivised farms for example).

So here we go;\n\nFirst of all, the Chinese government is objectively not run by an \"arguably fascist ruling party\" it is a communist party no more and no less and in fact is rather democratic, contrary to popular belief. With [grassroots organizing](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0097700407303966) projecting power [upward](https://news.cgtn.com/event/2021/who-runs-the-cpc/index.html), the people of China do hold much democratic power. One only has to look at what has occurred in China to see that this is true, with [800 million lifted out of poverty](https://www.worldbank.org/en/country/china/overview), and massive improvements to both quality of life and life expectancy in the last 40 years. For this, it is no wonder then, that according to harvard, the cpc has such a [95.5% approval rating](https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2020/07/long-term-survey-reveals-chinese-government-satisfaction/). \n\nSo what about the Uyghur genocide? Well, this, too has been muddied by western media outlets. Ask yourself, as a proclaimed leftist, do you trust western media as an outlet of imperialism which manufactures consent and invents reality (since you\u2019re active on r/anarchism, hopefully a Chomsky quote can be relatable to you). Well it\u2019s strange then, that even the western-based [world bank](https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/statement/2019/11/11/world-bank-statement-on-review-of-project-in-xinjiang-china) and perhaps more surprisingly, [the state department](https://foreignpolicy.com/2021/02/19/china-uighurs-genocide-us-pompeo-blinken/) believes there is no sufficient evidence of a genocide. And a poor genocide it would be, too, with the population of [Xinjiang increasing](https://amp.scmp.com/economy/global-economy/article/3133228/china-census-xinjiangs-population-jumps-183-cent-over-past). Strangely enough, Uyghurs and other ethnic minorities were even exempt from the one child policy when it was still in effect. On the other hand, even several (many Muslim) countries met on the UN to [denounce](https://ap.ohchr.org/documents/E/HRC/c_gov/A_HRC_41_G_17.DOCX) western propaganda and perceptions of the \u201cgenocide.\u201d In addition, I find it strange that Xinjiang is even open to tourism during a so-called genocide and that the economy of Xinjiang has boomed lately with many efforts from the CPC to boost it.\n\nChina has absolutely no reason to make a genocide, but if you\u2019d like to understand why efforts in Xinjiang do exist to combat terrorism, read this [fairly comprehensive take](https://worldaffairs.blog/2019/07/05/xinjiang-and-uyghurs-what-youre-not-being-told/).", "created_utc": "1644765297.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hws9qpq", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_sd63ix", "parent_id": "t1_hwnw4yx", "score": "1", "subreddit": "AlwaysTheSameMap", "subreddit_id": "t5_49l4hc"}, {"author": "Elucidate137", "body": ":(", "created_utc": "1644672297.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hwn54r7", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_sqf3be", "parent_id": "t1_hwlb6mp", "score": "2", "subreddit": "FUCKYOUINPARTICULAR", "subreddit_id": "t5_3538a"}, {"author": "Elucidate137", "body": "Invert the Indian peninsula/subcontinent so that it\u2019s a sea", "created_utc": "1644618441.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hwkeozb", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_spyzfh", "parent_id": "t3_spyzfh", "score": "2", "subreddit": "imaginarymapscj", "subreddit_id": "t5_73ze4"}, {"author": "Elucidate137", "body": ">Only in Russia \n\nAnd also everywhere else?", "created_utc": "1644597934.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hwivapv", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_spyufn", "parent_id": "t3_spyufn", "score": "2", "subreddit": "nonononoyes", "subreddit_id": "t5_2xp2p"}, {"author": "Elucidate137", "body": "replace ch\ud83e\udd2emsky with chad parenti", "created_utc": "1644579930.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hwhrwbf", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_spahad", "parent_id": "t3_spahad", "score": "1", "subreddit": "Hasan_Piker", "subreddit_id": "t5_qs1n3"}, {"author": "Elucidate137", "body": "yeah why exactly didn\u2019t they include much of Eastern Europe, European turkey, and northern Scandinavia", "created_utc": "1644546628.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hwgbjwd", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_quuhf2", "parent_id": "t1_hktdm0l", "score": "4", "subreddit": "MapPorn", "subreddit_id": "t5_2si92"}, {"author": "Elucidate137", "body": "Bro just guessed canada", "created_utc": "1644544211.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hwg67yf", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_sp8gn9", "parent_id": "t3_sp8gn9", "score": "1", "subreddit": "AlwaysTheSameMap", "subreddit_id": "t5_49l4hc"}, {"author": "Elucidate137", "body": "presented by \u2728 draft dodging \u2728\n\nI\u2019m not fighting for my shitty country", "created_utc": "1644451128.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hwaps3m", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_snxn7y", "parent_id": "t3_snxn7y", "score": "1", "subreddit": "AskMen", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s30g"}, {"author": "Elucidate137", "body": "RIP to all of South and Central America and how tf is Sweden not mentioned?

The Tilean economy is extremely robust, but it still took around 15 turns and several ambushes and hard-fought battles to raise a second army so that I could surpass the garrison at sartosa. With this second army, though, I crushed the pirates and moved my attention to the north at skavenblight. I was able to confederate with the city state of Tobaro, which had been warring with estalia for some time. Estalia which was also at war with my good friends the new world colonies, did not enjoy my presence, but was still trading with me (I had a mod which enabled trade routes between colonies and their parent factions). With tobaro under control and sartosa as well, I moved to crush Skavenblight, but as I converged on it from both tobaro and miragliano, the orcs to my east declared war on me with two full stacks and I had to retreat one of my armies. The other army was badly wounded in the skaven swamps and I had to quickly rebuild it in tobaro in order to defend against the skaven. They attacked and I managed to hold them off, weakening them enough that I could take skavenblight. However, in the east, my efforts were not going well against the orcs, I held miragliano, but was losing a lot of money to their raiding camps. At this point, the dwarves of clan angrund reached out for an alliance and they quickly took a city from the orcs, who retreated. At this point, I quickly crushed the orcs with the help of angrund and had finally turned skavenblight into a habitable ground. \n\nBut suddenly, estalia declared war on me! With estalia at war with my colonies as well as me, I was able to confederate with the colonies, opening a second front near hexoatl. With my full strength finally directed in one place, I quickly squashed estalia and forged an alliance with the now powerful huntsman\u2019s expedition (they had taken around 6 settlements and were well established). I bought a few settlements off of them (region trade mod), and gifted them one of mine, and then sent armies north to attack hexoatl. Hexoatl\u2019s armies were strong, but a hastily made non aggression pact and military access agreement with skeggi meant that skeggi could march on them, weakening them for me. While all of this had been going on, I had been forging alliances and bolstering trade with the factions of ulthuan, and was now receiving a sizeable amount of money from trade (about 50% of my income). My largest partners were ellyrion, eataine, and khemri. Bringing the elves, north of hexoatl, into the game, I opened a second front on them, and quickly they capitulated. I am still in the middle of this campaign, but the high elves recently declared war on Bretonnia and the thousand maws have also moved into the north of bretonnia, so I assume that my attention will soon be brought back to the old world. I have confederated the border princess and my economy is unrivaled thanks to lucrative trade and technology, good relations with the Dawi and humans and terrible climates in the badlands have slowly led this campaign to its end as i think I have done all I want with it.

It is also obvious that the undisguised imperialist policy of ultimatums, with the object of isolating the Soviet Union, is merely producing results opposite to these intended. A situation was created in which Poincar\u00e9 and Curzon, while faithfully and loyally serving imperialism, nevertheless, by their \u201cwork\u201d intensified the growing crisis in Europe, roused the resistance of the masses to imperialism, and pushed the masses towards revolution. Hence, the bourgeoisie\u2019s inevitable transition from the policy of frontal attack to the policy of compromise, from undisguised to disguised imperialism, from Poincar\u00e9 and Curzon to MacDonald and Herriot. Naked plundering of the world has become dangerous. The Labour Party in Britain and the Left bloc in France1 are to serve as a cloak to cover the nakedness of imperialism. That is the origin of \u201cpacifism\u201d and \u201cdemocracy.\u201d\"\n\n\"Firstly, it is not true that fascism is only the fighting organisation of the bourgeoisie. Fascism is not only a military-technical category. Fascism is the bourgeoisie\u2019s fighting organisation that relies on the active support of Social-Democracy. Social-Democracy is objectively the moderate wing of fascism. There is no ground for assuming that the fighting organisation of the bourgeoisie can achieve decisive successes in battles, or in governing the country, without the active support of Social-Democracy. There is just as little ground for thinking that Social-Democracy can achieve decisive successes in battles, or in governing the country, without the active support of the fighting organisation of the bourgeoisie. These organisations do not negate, but supplement each other. They are not antipodes, they are twins. Fascism is an informal political bloc of these two chief organisations; a bloc, which arose in the circumstances of the post-war crisis of imperialism, and which is intended for combating the proletarian revolution. The bourgeoisie cannot retain power without such a bloc. It would therefore be a mistake to think that \u201cpacifism\u201d signifies the liquidation of fascism. In the present situation, \u201cpacifism\u201d is the strengthening of fascism with its moderate, Social-Democratic wing pushed into the forefront.\"", "created_utc": "1640958608.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hqoiswm", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_rrmxj8", "parent_id": "t1_hqogall", "score": "2", "subreddit": "alltheleft", "subreddit_id": "t5_2shjt"}, {"author": "Elucidate137", "body": "Cue the classic socdem quote \n\nhttps://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/stalin/works/1924/09/20.htm", "created_utc": "1640897212.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hqld4f1", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_rrmxj8", "parent_id": "t1_hqjql8f", "score": "3", "subreddit": "alltheleft", "subreddit_id": "t5_2shjt"}, {"author": "Elucidate137", "body": "straight up wtf", "created_utc": "1640876705.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hqjwq3x", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_rrne8b", "parent_id": "t3_rrne8b", "score": "3", "subreddit": "imaginarymapscj", "subreddit_id": "t5_73ze4"}, {"author": "Elucidate137", "body": "out of curiosity, what is FotS?

What sort of manner of speech would make more sense for acting if any?", "created_utc": "1637171048.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hl0h58d", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_qw3lmf", "parent_id": "t1_hl0c5ob", "score": "1", "subreddit": "autism", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhs6"}, {"author": "Elucidate137", "body": "Hmm this is really good advice. The character doesn\u2019t like to be touched and is generally written to not understand social interactions. This is my biggest gripe and I think the worst in my opinion, for example there is a line that talks about how the character laughed with people who bullied him because he didn\u2019t understand it was mean. In another line, he wishes he wasn\u2019t autistic, which I find is generally not the case with my friends who I\u2019ve talked to about this. The character also has some \u2018tics\u2019 like wringing his hands or over complicating things.\n\nI feel like it\u2019s written by someone who just doesn\u2019t understand but I can\u2019t get around that.
