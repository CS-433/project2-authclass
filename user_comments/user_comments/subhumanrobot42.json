And I am a language learner. \n\nWe have an entry test at my school. \n\nSo many students get assigned to a class, then tell the teacher they\u2019re in the wrong level, they should be in the next class.\n\nOk, sometimes there are extenuating circumstances, for example being ill, someone else doing the test for the student (happened a lot during the lockdown), cheating.\n\nHowever, the teacher will recognise the students ability fairly quickly. You recognise which students need the extra help, which students are stronger in which skills. For me, it might take a lesson. Often less than that. Some students have what we call a \u2018jagged profile\u2019. Middle Eastern students are typically stronger with their speaking and listening skills, but find reading, writing and using grammar accurately while speaking much harder (they typically use simple tenses, use \u2018double past\u2019 eg I didn\u2019t played yesterday). So they will argue that they should be in a higher class because they can communicate, yet they can\u2019t write a simple sentence. Japanese students are typically stronger at grammar and reading, but find speaking and listening much harder. You may have a better vocabulary and speaking skills than your classmates, but there would be a reason they are keeping you in that class. \n\n\n>Also, my situation was that I registered right before the entrance exam, and didn't know there was one until right before I took it. So there wasn't much I could do to prepare for it.\n\nA test is to gauge the students ability, but it isn\u2019t the only factor taken into consideration. I have always moved students up if I think they are capable. I have also moved students down if I think they are struggling. It happens all the time. However there is no point \u2018preparing\u2019 for such a test. It\u2019s a test of your everyday ability. How much you understand. You can\u2019t necessarily \u2018prepare\u2019 for such a test. I don\u2019t know how the test you did worked, but at my language school the test is adaptive. So it is the same test for all students. Meaning if you are A1 (the level I teach) and you are getting questions about past models and mixed conditionals, then you must be cheating (or having incredibly lucky guesses) because if you get questions correct, the questions get harder and if you get questions wrong. It gets easier.\n\n\n\n\nSo as a language learner. I am in a language class for my target language, and if I am honest it is below my level. I had studied regularly, then took a year out due to personal reasons. I did not study for a year, and I forgot a lot. My classmates struggle with things I find easy, such as grammar and reading.However, the class is not a complete waste of time. I took a test this week, my grammar is C1, my reading B1. However, my listening is A1 - I struggle with this a lot. I am constantly reviewing things and I am finding this beneficial, and I always do my own dictations - i write notes while my classmates answer, and it has really helped me develop my listening skills. Focus on what you are getting out of the class - better writing skills, more accuracy with grammar and vocabulary. You can always get something out of studying.", "created_utc": "1665749422.0", "edited": "1665749683.0", "id": "isa1x3p", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_y3ednk", "parent_id": "t3_y3ednk", "score": "8", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "subhumanrobot42", "body": "Same.

Usually 300 this time of year, increasing to 400+ in summer. In class we have limited it to 12 students max per room, but our rooms are quite small. We used to fit in 20 students. Most students live in university accommodation, with some in private flats and others (mostly 17 - 18 y/o)in homestays. Some in private flats did have parties, they invited classmates. But we can't control them outside of school. Just control the school environment. Many of the Middle Eastern students did not want to wear masks, wanted to continue greeting their friends with handshakes, hugs, kisses. Several European students wanted to party. You just had to be persistent.\n\nFor us, if a student persistently does not follow the rules, they're told to leave. Even pre covid. They get warnings and if they still refuse to follow, they're gone. We've had to give out warnings, but we didn't have to exclude anyone between September and December. \n\n\nYou know at the end of one lesson, I had the following exchange with a student \n\"teacher, you didn't tell me off about my mask today\"\n\"did you take it off?\"\n\"no\"\n\"so there was no reason to\"\n\nI think he thought i told him off for my own enjoyment", "created_utc": "1609743243.0", "edited": "False", "id": "gi1npj9", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_kpqnth", "parent_id": "t1_gi1mc2o", "score": "2", "subreddit": "worldnews", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13"}, {"author": "subhumanrobot42", "body": "Copying notes from the board wouldn't be the main part of class, just as a way of avoiding handouts.

Pdf copies of handouts, games. \n\nI used to work in Hong Kong. Pre-covid mind you, but masks are not a problem. Even young children can wear masks. OK, they might pull them down occasionally, but they just put up with it. Even the 'selfish' teenagers. Even people with learning disabilities. Even troubled 11 year olds.\n\nThe problem is we don't have discipline here. People are too scared to discipline their own kids, they're too scared of even saying no. That's why there's gangs of mask less teenagers roaming around in large groups, spreading covid even though 'its too unsafe to go to school'. Doesn't help the adults are too busy sprouting bullshit and claiming their excempt. Even the adults wearing masks in the supermarket don't wear them properly, with chip straps or their nose out. That's why we're in this mess. People just couldn't go without their big family Christmas, or holidays abroad, or going to the pub.\n\nEDIT: in September, students complained a LOT. About wearing masks in class, in the social area, in the corridors. That they had to copy grammar rules off the board, that the reading comprehension was on their phone instead of paper.

That only 2 people were allowed in the lift at a time. That the break times were different to their friends in another class.

This was destroyed by a fire,, and another church was built on the same site, which subsequently burnt down.  If you have visited, you will have seen the remains of this church around the entrance. Not long after the church burnt down again, Emperor Justinian ordered a new, larger. cathedral to be built on the site. This is mostly the building we see today. There were some changes made in the 1500s, such as the addition of the minarets, and many renovations (as a cathedral, a mosque and a museum), but the actual building was designed and built as a church. As far as I remember, the majority of changes by the Ottomans were on the outside of the building, not the inside.\n\nFrom being built, to the start of the 13th century, the building was initially a Byzantine Cathedral. During the 11th century, it was converted to being a Greek Orthodox Cathedral, and it remained as this (apart from a brief period as a Roman Catholic Cathedral in the 13th century) until Mehmet the Conqueror invaded Constantinople.\n\nSo for most of history, it was a church.

Their Families Don\u2019t Always Agree.\nWomen in the conservative kingdom are finding they have to negotiate with their relatives newly granted permissions to work, drive and travel.\n\nBy Vivian Yee\nMarch 14, 2020\n\nMEDINA, Saudi Arabia \u2014 On the question of women working, the law of the land was crystal clear. Raghda and Rafaa Abuazzah\u2019s parents had ruled otherwise.\n\n\u201cWhat will people say? You\u2019ll be in public!\u201d their father said after the sisters scandalized their parents by announcing that they wanted jobs at a coffee shop in Medina, the second-holiest city in Islam, where the Prophet Muhammad was said to have died. \u201cIt\u2019s fine to work in an office because no one can see you there. But how can you work with men?\u201d\n\nTwo years and much ado later, Raghda serves lattes filigreed with milk art at a strip-mall coffee shop and Rafaa hosts community gatherings at an event space across the way. Their co-workers and customers include men and women. Though their hair remains covered, their faces are bare. And their parents, to everyone\u2019s surprise, are coming around. Kind of.\n\n\u201cMy parents are against me working here. But it\u2019s so good to finally be myself,\u201d said Raghda, 21. \u201cNow, I\u2019m free. I can finally talk to people without covering my face.\u201d\n\nFor Westerners, squinting at Saudi Arabia across a vast landscape of stories about oppressed women, ultraconservative Islam and human rights abuses, the desert kingdom often leaves a single, damning impression: Here is a country that women are desperate to flee.\n\nBut the changes driven by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the kingdom\u2019s de facto ruler, have complicated that image over the last few years, codifying for women the right to drive, attend sporting events and travel without a man\u2019s permission, among others. As the social codes that long governed their lives relax their grip, more women are wearing their hair uncovered and mingling openly with men \u2014 at least in larger cities.\n\nBut whether reality lives up to the law depends on the dice roll of birth. Day by day, it still falls to women in many households to negotiate their freedoms with the fathers, husbands, brothers and sons who serve as their legal guardians.\n\nStarting a few years ago, women won rights that some from tolerant families already enjoyed, such as traveling alone.\nEven before the legal changes, Saudi women from tolerant families rarely had to chafe under requirements that a male guardian approve plans to get jobs or travel abroad. For them, permission was nearly always granted.\n\nThough Prince Mohammed has spoken of dismantling the guardianship system, women remain legal minors when it comes to marrying, living on their own and other matters. Those from more traditional families are still yoked to male guardians for whom fear of God, change or what the neighbors will think often outweighs the letter of the law.\n\nFor a long time, Raghda and Rafaa seemed fated to retrace the path of their five older sisters: arranged marriages while still young; children soon thereafter; faces covered with the niqab, the black veil that reveals only the eyes. The sisters who worked did so in the seclusion of offices, segregated from male co-workers.\n\nThe younger siblings were not looking forward to it.\n\n\u201cMe and Raghda were so depressed,\u201d said Rafaa, who is younger but more forceful. \u201cWe thought: We can\u2019t do anything. We don\u2019t have choices. This isn\u2019t the life we want to live.\u201d\n\nCompared with girls they had seen in Jeddah, the Saudi port city where looser social customs allowed women to go unveiled, wear their all-covering robes open over jeans and mingle with men in public, the sisters felt anonymous, forgettable.\n\n\u201cWe had no self-esteem,\u201d Raghda said, \u201cbecause we all looked the same.\u201d\n\nTriumphs that might seem trivial outside the kingdom loom huge within it, especially in the small cities and villages where most Saudis live, far from cosmopolitan Riyadh and Jeddah.\n\nFemale baristas were nonexistent in Medina when the sisters first got hired at a coffee shop whose owner had decided to brave it. Skittish about their uncovered faces and flustered about their friendly interactions with boys, he fired them soon after.\n\nBy then, however, other cafes had opened with both male and female staff. Raghda and Rafaa found new jobs, Raghda at Dasoqa, a coffee shop whose name means \u201cladybug,\u201d and Rafaa at Blink, a community gathering space nearby.\n\nTheir parents have caved a little, but fretted a lot. They feared for the family\u2019s reputation as much as for their daughters\u2019 souls.\n\n\u201cOur dad says, \u2018What if my family came and saw you here working, making coffee and drinks?\u2019\u201d said Raghda. \u201c\u2018They\u2019ll see your face!\u2019\u201d\n\nTo the sisters, that was the point. Raghda\u2019s hair remains neatly tucked under a lilac head scarf, Rafaa\u2019s under a black one. But their faces \u2014 sometimes people still do a double-take when they see them \u2014 are bare.\n\n\u201cMy face is my identity,\u201d said Rafaa.\n\nIt was not only their parents who objected. When they waited for Ubers after work, the young men hanging around the mall often heckled them, suspicious of their uncovered faces and light makeup.\n\n\u201cWhat are you doing with those guys?\u201d they demanded as the sisters chatted with male friends.\n\nThe lack of reliable public polling and free speech makes it difficult to gauge how Saudis view women\u2019s changing status. But one study, from 2018, suggested that fear of social stigma may drive opposition more than personal resistance.\n\nIt found that a majority of Saudi husbands approve of their wives working outside the home, yet underestimate how many other men also support it. Telling them that more men actually favored it was enough encouragement for them to register their wives for a job-recruitment service.\n\nThe problem is persuading individual legal guardians that attitudes are changing.\n\nBy December, Raghda and Rafaa had turned to their next project: persuading their father to let them go to an electronic music festival in Riyadh, a 90-minute flight away, with a group of friends, male and female.\n\nRafaa told him they were going to \u201ca festival,\u201d omitting the part about the music. But he had already read all about it.\n\n\u201cDad said, \u2018I know it\u2019s a concert. I\u2019m on Twitter, too,\u2019\u201d she said.\n\nAs she spoke, her phone buzzed. She held it up, wide-eyed. \u201cYes,\u201d his text message read. \u201cYou can go.\u201d\n\nTheir parents\u2019 easing up has mirrored a general loosening of Saudi society, much of it owing to the legal changes set in motion by the crown prince, who has erased many social restrictions and defanged the once-feared religious police.\n\nThough Crown Prince Mohammed remains a volatile and internationally controversial ruler \u2014 this month, he delivered back-to-back surprises by detaining at least four royal relatives and rocking global markets with a sudden oil price war \u2014 he appears committed to his social agenda.\n\nNot all the changes have been hard sells in Saudi Arabia.\n\nMany Saudis, having traveled and lived abroad or seen the world through the internet, were already ready for a more permissive way of life. Others, like Rafaa and Raghda, were pushing for it from below.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a huge wave that our parents can\u2019t stand in front of,\u201d Rafaa said. \u201cEven if they wanted to, they can\u2019t.\u201d\n\nIn Riyadh, the capital, it was not only respectability but religion that troubled Revan Moha\u2019s parents. Ms. Moha, a baby-faced 18-year-old with round, wire-rimmed glasses and close-cropped hair, had not dared tell her father that she had a job, let alone that she worked at a coffee shop where clientele and baristas mixed freely, male and female. \n\n\u201cHere in Saudi Arabia, it\u2019s always, \u2018What are people going to say?\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cI really don\u2019t care what people say, but my parents do.\u201d\n\nFor all the government reforms, she said, \u201cIf your family is traditional, it wouldn\u2019t help at all.\u201d\n\nThe gulf between strict and tolerant families can be vast. Women whose families raise no objections, like Joumana Alshaikh, 20, Ms. Moha\u2019s co-worker and friend, often assert that the crown prince has granted women all the rights they need.\n\n\u201cMy parents are OK with me traveling alone. Others\u2019 aren\u2019t,\u201d Ms. Alshaikh shrugged. \u201cIn other countries, men and women are living the same life, they\u2019re equal. But in Saudi, women are living the best life.\u201d\n\nMs. Moha stared. \u201cWhat? No!\u201d\n\nWhen she lived for a time with her strict, pious father after her parents\u2019 divorce, cutting her hair short was forbidden. So were talking to boys and outings with friends. So was playing music, as she dreamed of doing, or even listening to it.\n\nShe coped with an old iPod, a phone and a keyboard hidden in her room. When she heard her father coming home, her fingers flew to silence the music and close the social media apps where she chatted with male friends. After her father confiscated her phone, she would message friends from her laptop, wheedling them into ordering her Ubers so she could sneak out.\n\nMs. Alshaikh, who never had to sneak around her parents, sees the place of women differently.\n\n\u201cThe new thing is, women have more rights than men,\u201d she said. \u201cMen do things for women. He does whatever you want. You\u2019re the princess of the house.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d Ms. Moha sputtered. Things might be changing but she could not think of a single arena in which Saudi women\u2019s rights outstripped men\u2019s.\n\nHer father eventually gave up and sent her to live with her mother, under whose more permissive roof Ms. Moha cut her hair, uncovered her head, started wearing her abaya open over jeans and T-shirts and bought a piano and an electric guitar.\n\nShe has even told her mother that she has a job.
