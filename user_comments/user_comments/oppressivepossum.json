The best way to learn how an office works is just to watch and copy what your colleagues do. \n\nExpectations are different in each job, for example in one job I had, people would come in anywhere between 8-11am and leave between 6-8pm and that was fine. But in another job everyone arrived exactly at 10 and left exactly at 7. \n\nThere are also books that can guide you, like [https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/45711938-how-to-go-to-work](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/45711938-how-to-go-to-work) Hopefully you have a nice team who will help you through the process.
