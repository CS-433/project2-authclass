I think it has really changed my perception of falling in a way. I don\u2019t want to compare myself anymore, but I see my peers falling often and they never get injured-they learn from it. They use falling to their advantage. Whilst there is a significant risk involved in riding, I do believe that I just got very, very unlucky in breaking my arm. But because I have no other falls to compare it to, my brain just tells me that if I fall I will break my arm again. I will try to think rationally about this, knowing that I most likely won\u2019t get seriously injured if I fall again. But who knows?
