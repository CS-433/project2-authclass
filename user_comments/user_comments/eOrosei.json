But it made the news a few months ago that they had pretty much decriminalized petty theft, making any crime below 950$ (1000$ for New York) a misdemeanor. This was what was blamed for the alleged increase in shoplifting by the most hard hit victims (big box stores, discount stores, drug stores, etc). The data on it is pretty fuzzy so it's hard to be clear.\n\nMisdemeanor, pretty much means that these theft won't get prosecuted if there's a complaint, and cops won't investigate it either since they got more urgent stuff to deal with. So unless you literally steal in front of a cop, nothing will likely happen to you.\n\nIt doesn't help that covid got everyone on edge, lead to reduced staffing and other stuff advantageous for a potential thief. Also, everything that happened around the George Floyd's protest (riots being justified by politicians, looting being qualified as the voice of the unheard, the creation of autonomous zones that were pretty much tolerated, etc etc) lead to POC feeling much more emboldened about this. Pretty much all the videos I saw were of black dudes.\n\nSo there's a metric ton of these kind of videos where some dude or group of people come in steal shit and go out.\n\nEmployees won't do anything cause it's above their paygrade, and risking your life for that probably is not worth it. Security guards don't do much either, cause even if they're caught there's not much of a punition they can give you so they serve as glorified scarecrows. Also if the thief or someone else is hurt in the altercation it'd be even more expensive than the material loss.\n\nSo people feel emboldened stealing, and people just record them since there's nothing else they can do.\n\nAt least that's what I heard about it, I might be wrong.\n\n[e](https://www.hoover.org/research/why-shoplifting-now-de-facto-legal-california)dit: snipped a source, and modified that shoplifting had increased to what it is now. thx Season\n\n[https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2021/nov/24/california-smash-and-grabs-blamed-decriminalizatio/](https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2021/nov/24/california-smash-and-grabs-blamed-decriminalizatio/)\n\n[https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2021/12/shoplifting-holiday-theft-panic/621108/](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2021/12/shoplifting-holiday-theft-panic/621108/)", "created_utc": "1644103906.0", "edited": "1644244371.0", "id": "hvr77t8", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_sli0ai", "parent_id": "t3_sli0ai", "score": "23", "subreddit": "OutOfTheLoop", "subreddit_id": "t5_2xinb"}, {"author": "eOrosei", "body": "do body saws.\n\nvsit reps.", "created_utc": "1644016521.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hvmmqps", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_skquou", "parent_id": "t3_skquou", "score": "2", "subreddit": "Calisthenic", "subreddit_id": "t5_xewzv"}, {"author": "eOrosei", "body": "look up GTG.

With vocabs, even spending limited time studying, will give you noticeable improvements. You'll be able to frankenstein sentences, and actually understand bits of what is being said.

Starting with the writing system (hiragana/katakana), then basic grammar (n4 at least?) and vocab (1,5k to 2k). Then from there drop dedicated grammar studies entirely and immerse, or do a mix of grammar and immersion. By immerse, I mean **read** since it's imo much easier to see if something is at your level when you are reading it, rather than listening to it. \n\nVisual Novels are excellent for that, being both fun, diverse, and a lot of lists exist for them ranking them per language difficulty.

Audio immersion is important too, but in my experience improving reading first and listening later, is easier.

I won't say there's no double standard, but I know there are at least a few characters I can think off that would suit the traits you named about your heroine that are pretty much unanimously loved by the people who saw their story.\n\nFor me, what makes me like them is the fact that often there's a reason behind the why, or they are just cool as fuck and it makes sense in the realm of the story why they are so strong, Rebecca from Black Lagoon or Mereoleona from Black Clover are both great examples.\n\nBut write a character, guy or girl that is headstrong (stubborn even about stupid shit and will put others at risk for this reason or just won't listen to the other side no matter how sensible it is), determined (I really don't see why anyone would have a problem with that?) and blunt sense of humor (again only is a problem if the only personally trait of your character is being an asshole) and I personally won't like it. Usually if I still read after, it's either cause there are some redeeming qualities about the character (only me can be an asshole to my friends type of shit) or some sort of personal arc where they realize they are tripping and slowly change their ways. And even then, being an asshole is pretty much never framed as the right thing to do. At least not in the books I read.\n\nFrom what I saw however, what people tend to dislike about these kind of characters is that the fact that they are an asshole is played as a joke and never has tangible consequences, rather than treated as a character flaw. And also them getting power ups that feel undeserved or never having a real setback.\n\nCould just be me tho.", "created_utc": "1640405797.0", "edited": "1640406017.0", "id": "hpvubn2", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_rnwilw", "parent_id": "t3_rnwilw", "score": "1", "subreddit": "writing", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh2n"}, {"author": "eOrosei", "body": "how would your clones know that their originals died?

If max rep is 3, you might want to use a easier progression as to build muscle the optimal range is 5-12 (more like 6-8). On the other hand if your max rep is like 20 you might want to consider either adding weights or switching to a harder progression (ie: pushups to diamond pushups). \n\nAlso depends how many times per week you follow that regimen, a good rule of thumb is 3 workouts a week, this way you got recovery and rest days implemented automatically. \n\nFinally pushups and pullups target mainly the upper body and are respectively an horizontal pushing move and a vertical pulling move. To make sure your routine is well rounded you should prolly pick 2 pushing moves (1 horizontal, 1 vertical), 2 pulling moves  (1 horizontal, 1 vertical) and 1 (or 2) leg moves to practice.\n\nie: pushups & pike pushup (or handstand pushup) /pull-ups and bodyweight rows/ lunges\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBy themselves pushups and pullups are not quite enough to lead to developing your perfect body.", "created_utc": "1639185470.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ho2a2rc", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_rdnmac", "parent_id": "t3_rdnmac", "score": "1", "subreddit": "Calisthenic", "subreddit_id": "t5_xewzv"}, {"author": "eOrosei", "body": "Yoo thanks a lot for this, Imma give them all a check!", "created_utc": "1639184357.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ho27ll4", "is_submitter": "True", "link_id": "t3_rdiyrt", "parent_id": "t1_ho1sbco", "score": "2", "subreddit": "LearnJapanese", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qyls"}, {"author": "eOrosei", "body": "it's not always a problem but it can be.
