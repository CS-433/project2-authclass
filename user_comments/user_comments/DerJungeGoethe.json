Thus, they are likely to provide greater protection against STDs that are transmitted only by genital fluids (STDs such as gonorrhea, chlamydia, trichomoniasis, and HIV infection) than against infections that are transmitted primarily by skin-to-skin contact, which may or may not infect areas covered by a condom (STDs such as genital herpes, human papillomavirus [HPV] infection, syphilis, and chancroid).", "created_utc": "1645090901.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hxafh67", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_suk296", "parent_id": "t1_hxaezlo", "score": "1", "subreddit": "Egypt", "subreddit_id": "t5_2ql2m"}, {"author": "DerJungeGoethe", "body": "Lol", "created_utc": "1645089526.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hxadqcf", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_suk296", "parent_id": "t1_hxablld", "score": "1", "subreddit": "Egypt", "subreddit_id": "t5_2ql2m"}, {"author": "DerJungeGoethe", "body": "There's no such thing.", "created_utc": "1645089498.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hxadp3l", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_suk296", "parent_id": "t1_hxact9d", "score": "-2", "subreddit": "Egypt", "subreddit_id": "t5_2ql2m"}, {"author": "DerJungeGoethe", "body": "Just that?", "created_utc": "1644895997.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hwzpuyd", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_ssgkhf", "parent_id": "t1_hwyxbb7", "score": "3", "subreddit": "Sufism", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rus7"}, {"author": "DerJungeGoethe", "body": "It wasn't me who translated the hadith, and also it says RUBBISH.", "created_utc": "1644417099.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hw88613", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_so2f90", "parent_id": "t1_hw83sdi", "score": "-7", "subreddit": "MuslimLounge", "subreddit_id": "t5_2w6wd"}, {"author": "DerJungeGoethe", "body": "Sure the prophet will call his people scum and rubbish, I don't understand how do people believe that such words are that of the prophet?", "created_utc": "1644410653.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hw7utzi", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_so2f90", "parent_id": "t3_so2f90", "score": "-6", "subreddit": "MuslimLounge", "subreddit_id": "t5_2w6wd"}, {"author": "DerJungeGoethe", "body": "I haven't done any of that but whatever.", "created_utc": "1644242695.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hvy1pb4", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_smgz32", "parent_id": "t1_hvy09pa", "score": "-5", "subreddit": "MuslimLounge", "subreddit_id": "t5_2w6wd"}, {"author": "DerJungeGoethe", "body": "Horny and frustrated ayyy?", "created_utc": "1644241003.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hvxy9ix", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_smgz32", "parent_id": "t3_smgz32", "score": "-6", "subreddit": "MuslimLounge", "subreddit_id": "t5_2w6wd"}, {"author": "DerJungeGoethe", "body": ">He was actually being sex trafficked and tried to escape\n\nHow do you know?", "created_utc": "1643609417.0", "edited": "False", "id": "huyn187", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_sg7gme", "parent_id": "t1_hux4b2h", "score": "2", "subreddit": "Egypt", "subreddit_id": "t5_2ql2m"}, {"author": "DerJungeGoethe", "body": "\u0627\u064a\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u064a \u062f\u0644\u062f\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0648\u0627\u062f \u0627\u0628\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0643\u0644\u0628 \u062f\u0627 \u0643\u062f\u0627\u061f", "created_utc": "1643549295.0", "edited": "False", "id": "huuljea", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_sg7gme", "parent_id": "t3_sg7gme", "score": "70", "subreddit": "Egypt", "subreddit_id": "t5_2ql2m"}, {"author": "DerJungeGoethe", "body": " when the cow eats the grass it eats me, so we're even.", "created_utc": "1643528174.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hutsbzy", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_sflqrm", "parent_id": "t1_huqw5g1", "score": "0", "subreddit": "Psychonaut", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qplv"}, {"author": "DerJungeGoethe", "body": "The dajjal yes....

They seem pretty much the same to me, it has always bothered me, the fact that they have these sorts of experiences are in all religions other than Islam, which is supposed to be an impossibility ( Islamically speaking) : as these religions from the Islamic pov are false and their practitioners are in falsehood and will be thrown into the fire, let alone that Allah SWT allows them these experiences of nearness to him.\n\n\n To most people these questions aren't bothersome at all ,the typical answer is : their experiences are the work of jinn or a universalist Muslim ( deviant by the Islamic criteria ) might say Allah is the God of everyone , and all religions lead to him. Personally, these two answers aren't satisfying at all because they are FALSE.\n\n\nThe conclusion I reached is that either it's all the work of the brain and biology or it's something spiritual and universal in the sense that it belongs to NO religion rather than ALL religions, and these miracles and experiences are then attributed to whatever religion.

He was one of the prominent refusers of \"metaphor\" in the Holy Quran. He even rushed to accuse those who understand these attributes and acts \"rationally\", inspired by esthetics of Arabic language and its idiomatic linguistic styles, of misinterpretation and alteration. \u00a0He called them \"those whose hearts are given to swerving from the truth\". Thus, he closed the door totally in the face of the rational understanding that delves through its clear implications and correct meanings. Rather, he closed the door in the face of spiritual inspiration which is felt by the delicate hearts towards the Holy Quran. Such inspiration that clears away the density of the substance and darkness of the veils!!!\n\n\nThink not that this \"literal\" approach that refuses the rational understanding is only restricted to the Quranic text; in fact, this \"literalism\" becomes later an \"approach of life\" and a \"perspective of vision\". Those who adopt this approach use it to look through all affairs of universe and the dimensions of existence; their subconscious resorts to facets and superficial aspects away from profundity. If you return your sight and scrutinize those who inherited the legacy of Ibn Taymiyyah's approach, you will find obviously its impact on their behavior, appearance and interior. In addition, you will find that this heavy verbal \"gate\" closed the mental horizons in their faces. They only have one inflexible direction that is full of tense entries abounding with declaring fellow Muslims of infidelity, polytheism, inventing novelty, practicing lewdness, since their perspective of \"verbal\" vision has no capacity for other terminology on which they only depend!!!\n\n\nThe second issue of Ibn Taymiyyah was closely associated with the previous one, on the grounds that the simple sense of \"monotheism\" Tawheed, through which general public of the Ummah have entered the broad arena of \"faith\" since the prophetic age, exists in acknowledging of the obvious truth, which is the inner adhesion and credence of Theism and the divine message by mind and soul. This deep and simple concept at the same time is the sense of the \"testimony\" which is considered the main pillar of faith. Thus, the Asha'ari school of thought was responsible, throughout its history, for the mental foundation of this concept and its lawful rooting. This concept guarded faith and creed of the Ummah and its social peace as well. Such concept restricted polytheism and disbelief only to those who deny Theism and the divine message by mind and soul, however these are innermost feelings and thoughts that are known only by the Knower of \u00a0the things unwitnessed.\n\n\nOn the other hand, the previously mentioned verbal and literal approach of Ibn Taymiyyah, replaces this simple and tolerant concept of Tawhid, with a complicated one that is divided into three branches: Deism (belief in the Oneness of the Lordship of Allah), Theism (belief in the Oneness of the worship of Allah), \u00a0and the Names and Attributes of Allah. Each of these branches contains and includes details, twists, and conditions, that shifted Tawhid from simplicity to complexity; and then, other followers of Ibn Taymiyyah, added to these branches another four concepts, burdened with intellectual and dynamic loads, that are also exhausted with loaded concepts about: God, Deity, Worship and Religion. Hence, the simple and easy concept of Tawhid, has become, at the hands of Ibn Taymiyyah and his followers, contaminated with the thorns of Takfir (declaring fellow Muslims as disbelievers) and accusing others with Polytheism (Tashrik); thus, the door was wide open for disbelief, allowing bloodshed and theft. Desperately, the issue of \"Fighting the Abstaining Group\" was raised, which the strayed Takfiri groups exploited to practice Takfir while claiming that they are calling for Jihad. These Takfiri groups are not ashamed of practicing Takfir, since all the tools and privileges were at their hands.", "created_utc": "1624236552.0", "edited": "False", "id": "h2hjl03", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_o4eo69", "parent_id": "t1_h2hixs6", "score": "0", "subreddit": "islam", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhbp"}, {"author": "DerJungeGoethe", "body": "This isn't what literalists/ wahabbis / salafis believe tho.", "created_utc": "1624235639.0", "edited": "False", "id": "h2hhyex", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_o4eo69", "parent_id": "t1_h2hh06o", "score": "1", "subreddit": "islam", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhbp"}, {"author": "DerJungeGoethe", "body": "I am not arguing about whether the stories are in the books or not, but rather whether they happened or not.

But we don't believe that prophet Muhammad started a religion that was unknown before, Islam was there from the time of adam (as). All the religions that Allah sent was Islam before they got changed,and All the prophets like Abraham, moses, Jesus etc were Muslims, and they were \"sufis\" meaning devout.\n\nYou see the problem with that (so called) \"sufi\" order that you ascribe to, is that it has to appeal to many different people with different and often contradictory theologies that cannot be reconciled with each other. for example hindus and Buddhists are panthiests and Muslims aren't, as we believe Allah is utterly unlike his creation nor he unites with it nor he enters it. So your teacher will have to deviate from the Quran and sunnah (if he follows them at all) and pick words that are ambiguous to suit the different groups he is addressing. I would advise you if you are a Muslim to join an order that are Muslims and follow the Qur'aan and sunnah.\n\nLastly regarding Rumi (may Allah be pleased with him) his poetry should not be taken literally, because it can easily be misunderstood. A quote from his I remember\n\n\"I am the servant of the Qur'an as long as I have life. I am the dust on the path of Muhammad, the Chosen One\"\n\nWe can see clearly that he affirms the Quran and the prophet, so his poetry should not be interpreted in a way that goes against the theology of Islam as it was clearly not his intentions.", "created_utc": "1620947170.0", "edited": "1620947506.0", "id": "gy1bx35", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_nbf9eg", "parent_id": "t1_gy1945t", "score": "7", "subreddit": "Sufism", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rus7"}, {"author": "DerJungeGoethe", "body": "Thanks!
