As such, it is a product of its time, where no one can't expect Lovely Writer/KinnPorshe/Bad Buddy/You-Name-It depth of characters, exposition, strong emotions and ample affection.\n\nAs for the discrepancies between the series (and especially Dark Blue Kiss) it remains to be seen, I haven't watched everything yet, and to be honest it's something that doesn't bother me much. I can understand the need for a \"soft reboot\" or the retconning of some information in later iterations. The thing that did bother me though is that in Kiss, around episodes 11-13, their story progressed without any foreshadowing whatsoever, and it actually felt like there were scenes missing. Like I was watching the middle of a dialogue, and the first part was nowhere to be found. Also please don't hate me, but so far I haven't found any *great* chemistry between them. Maybe it gets better later.\n\nSo I think Kiss should be a hard pass for anyone. You can do without it.

I'm late to the party, but I just stumbled upon this topic and would like to offer my two cents, since I've devised a mode of my own a decade or so ago, and been using it here and there for fun. You've done a great job so far! I wasn't part of the previous discussions so I'm sorry in advance if my comments refer to older points already talked about, or if they seem too long.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. Is the goal a phonetic representation of the language or a transliteration of the original orthography?\n2. I detect an inclination towards using the Quesset\u00e9ma for the velar consonants, although the Calmat\u00e9ma are not explicitly excluded. I'd go for the Calmat\u00e9ma for the following reasons: In Quenya we have **c**alma/**h**arma/a**nc**a and **qu**esse/**hw**esta/u**nqu**e. There is a distinction between the /k/ and /k^(w)/ and the \"simple\" /k/, /x/ (without the extra /^(w)/ sound) are represented by Calmat\u00e9ma. And although European Spanish use the Quesset\u00e9ma (e.g. [here](http://lambenor.free.fr/tengwar/espanol_2006.html)), Latin American Spanish use the Calmat\u00e9ma (e.g. [here](https://www.omniglot.com/conscripts/tengwaresla.php)). Also, with the Calmat\u00e9ma one less stroke is written, making each letter easier/quicker to write and a bit \"cleaner\" looking.\n3. If we're going for an orthographic transliteration, are the \u03bc\u03c0, \u03bd\u03c4, \u03b3\u03ba tengwar necessary? In Greek they are a combination of letters, and although pronounced as a whole, they are still written separately. The distinction between /b/, /mb/, or /mp/ for example is inferred by the meaning, but not by the orthography itself.\n4. Why the disparity between the silme and esse nuquerna? Why not use silme and esse, or silme n. and esse n.? I'd go for silme n. since most tehtar go above the tengwa. You keep the slate clean.\n5. I find sa-rince for the final \u03c2 a bit weird, since it doesn't always connect well with the preceding tengwa. I know that's the exact meaning of it, a shorthand s for the end of words/sentences. But with the extra use of the sa-rince in \u03be and, and especially \u03c8 its use becomes ambiguous. A simple silme n. would do just fine. A comparable situation occurs in greeklish for example. Though there are no set rules, with many \"systems\" (such as th or 8 for \u03b8, ks or 3 for \u03be, etc) there's no distinction between \u03c3 and \u03c2 and for both s is used (e.g. seismos).\n6. In a similar manner, are the \u03c4\u03c3, \u03c4\u03b6 tengwar necessary? \u039e and \u03c8 are standalone letters, and the addition of sa-rince is an excellent choice. But why complicate things more? Also, \u03c8 and \u03c4\u03c3 look awfully similar. A simple silme (or silme nuquerna) would work just fine. As a result there's no need for convoluted rules about the positioning of the tehtar.\n7. Is there any value in using romen alonside ore for the r value? I know it doesn't fit with the transliteration scope, and there is only one r, but it would be a fun gimmick.\n8. Isn't using noldo and aldo for the phonemic values of \u03bd(\u03b9) and \u03bb(\u03b9) a bit excessive? Since the synizesis of vowels is codified by using the non-syllabic combinations of tehtar (such as \u03bc\u03c5\u03b1\u03bb\u03cc in your example).\n9. An initial thought on vowels: '\u03c9' as a double o-tehta is a nice choice and intuitive, as it's the same sound. The use of a double e-tehta for '\u03b7' requires a small learning curve. If we were talking about Ancient Greek, sure, the '\u03b7' was indeed a long '\u03b5'. But in Modern Greek '\u03b7' is just another '\u03b9' sound. As such one dot for '\u03b9' and two dots for '\u03b7' seem more intuitive to me. As for the '\u03c5' using the u-tehta is a nice choice.\n10. For the diphthongs created with '\u03b9', we could use the silent e tehta Tolkien uses in his English mode. It's quite easy to understand, and much easier to write. ([link](https://www.tecendil.com/?q=%EE%80%80%EE%81%85%EE%81%80%20%CF%84%CE%B1%CE%B9%0A%EE%80%80%EE%81%85%EE%81%86%20%CF%84%CE%B5%CE%B9%0A%EE%80%80%EE%81%85%EE%81%8A%20%CF%84%CE%BF%CE%B9%0A%EE%80%80%EE%81%85%EE%81%93%20%CF%84%CF%85%CE%B9)). Similarly, diphthongs with '\u03c5' could be written with the inverted u-tehta ([link](https://glaemscrafu.jrrvf.com/english/glaemscribe.html?glaemie=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)). I admit this is an early thought, and it doesn't take into account stressed syllables, but it's what I've been using all these years and found really easy to codify.\n\nOk, so, I think that's all from me for now, mainly in regard to the consonants. I've a expressed a few premature thoughts on vowels as well, but we can take one thing at a time.\n\nI don't have any credentials in Tolkien literature and maybe some things of what I propose are never attested. Or there may be some \"universal\" standards that have long been established that I'm not aware of (like using the Quesset\u00e9ma instead of the Calmat\u00e9ma). So I'm just throwing ideas to keep the ball rolling :)\n\nBut then again, isn't every alphabet kinda alive? Especially in the early stages of its development. If Phoenicians saw their alphabet was turned upside down, with consonants dropped and vowels added they would have been astonished (and maybe indeed they were). Also the Latin and Cyrillic alphabets were altered (the latter heavily) to accommodate their respective target languages. So I believe a degree of modification is required, as the alphabet should accommodate the language and not the opposite.", "created_utc": "1630102380.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ham28sv", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_nk85g3", "parent_id": "t3_nk85g3", "score": "1", "subreddit": "Tengwar", "subreddit_id": "t5_2wvc1"}, {"author": "iasonnn", "body": "I knew it reminded me of something, but I didn't really remember the actual passage.\n\nThank you so much for your comprehensive analysis, it's very interesting!

It doesn't take that much, really.\n\nAs for Nubsib in ep. 6 at fist I was, too, almost crying out loud \"come on, *do* say something!\". But, the second time around, I thought that this too is typical of Nubsib, waiting for consent from Gene. I.e. I have something important to tell you, will you let me?

However this was not reflected (at all) in written greek, where they predominantly wrote in a more traditional form, mimicking the (revered) classic writers.\n\nSo, the first text that appears in a form of \"colloquial greek\" is the epic of Digenis Akritas, \\~1100-1200AD.

Ok, not 100% perfect, but tell me a piece of fiction (be it a book, a comic, a film, or a tv series) that you don't find *any* flaws in, whatsoever.

Verbal, and mostly non-verbal. I know each and every one of us have different taste and expectations, in regards to pacing and execution. But for me this is a series that transcends its \"BL\" label. It's a true and realistic love story. (Of course to the point it can be, having some genre fail-safes). But it is not really a \"Boys\" love, it is a love between adults. And adults are not okay with just longing stares and nods. They want and need to kiss, to hug, to touch, to have sex. And this is what Gene and Nubsib do, oh, so wonderfully. After all, isn't it shamelessly up there in the (Thai) title?\n\nAnd what a brilliant way to tie it all together. The title (nubsib ja joop - count to ten and I'll kiss you) and the song all coming together in the most moving scene ever, where they are reunited, and they kiss, kiss, kiss. Also, the very next, non-verbal scene which is like giving a vow of being there for each other. Or as u/flwr_doya more eloquently than me put it:\n\n>\\[...\\] the scene with them holding each other's hands, nuzzling and feeling each other's faces actually did serve a purpose in that end to get across non-verbally their feelings.\n\nI think the director has a thing for non-verbal scenes, he has said so in a behind-the-scenes video, and even if he didn't, we've seen it utilized throughout the series.\n\nAs for Aoey, I agree with what's been already said here (he pushed too far seeking affirmation, and it kinda backfired) but I also get the feeling that the director wanted us, if not to feel some sympathy for him, at least not to say \"yeah, you deserved what you got\". Because I really didn't think that. He is a convoluted and nuanced character indeed.\n\nOn a side-note, is it really a directional choice for Mhok to appear this little? I admit it kinds fits the story (Mhok kinda moved on, and Aoey feels left behind) but he appears for a few seconds with a mask. Maybe he was under suspicion of having contracted Covid? (Although come to think of it, in Thailand they have strict protocols for this, and he wouldn't be able to appear at all if this were the case?)\n\nI'm so sorry for my long, arbitrary, kinda mumbling post, but after this I feel kinda empty (not in a very bad way?) and I don't think that I'll find another series this fulfilling.

(Unlike Harribel, which was very thoughtful, yes, but her Fraccion had respect and reverence towards her - which is not a bad thing, but being on equal terms is so much better).\n\nOn the other hand I think Ulquiorra had one of the most complete character developments.
