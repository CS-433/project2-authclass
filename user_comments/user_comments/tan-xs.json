If you don\u2019t adjust it, my backhand might be good, but then my forehand would suffer; my forehand might be powerful, but my backhand wouldn\u2019t be as strong. \n\nSince pingpong is much more serious than it has been, it is important that both the forehand and backhand plays are powerful. This is unlike before when it was only important that the forehand was played well, and the backhand could be used as backup. However, in today\u2019s fast-paced sport, we need to take care of both fore and backhanded plays, and this requires adjusting grip.\n\nFirst let\u2019s talk about backhand grip. With the backhand, we need to ensure that we have a powerful swing, so the positioning of the racket must be favourable to our backhand. For the racket position to be favourable to the backhand, it has to be somewhat hooked, that way we can pull in our wrist, giving a more powerful swing. If our arm is a straight line, then we can\u2019t pull our wrist in, making the power of the stroke less concentrated and therefore weaker. When doing a backhanded hit, the position of the thumb is also very crucial. If we place the thumb lower, we have less control over the paddle, and feel less in control of its movement, reducing the amount of power. The thumb must be placed on the face of the paddle, that way the paddle is gripped tighter, producing a more powerful delivery. \n\nWhen using the forehand grip, if we are holding it in a way favourable to the backhand, the area in which we can hit the ball with will become too narrow, and the swing will be less powerful. So we need to ensure that the position of the paddle is in line with my arm, keeping everything straight. If, for example, I put my thumb here, then the paddle and my arm would be slightly angled. Therefore,  I have to move my thumb downwards, that way I keep a straight line and my forehand will be stronger. The paddle, whose strength comes from my arm, will be powerful.\n\nIn short, when we switch from forehand to backhand, we have to readjust the way we grip the paddle. If we use the backhand grip position to hit the ball forehanded, it won\u2019t work. We have to first readjust our grip and paddle position, then make the swing.\n\n\ud83c\udfd3Demonstration\ud83c\udfd3\n\nSo, if you want to have a strong hit both forehanded and backhanded, paddle grip is the most important. This is something you must pay attention to.\"", "created_utc": "1666044550.0", "edited": "False", "id": "isqa4cq", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_y6a1ou", "parent_id": "t3_y6a1ou", "score": "1", "subreddit": "translator", "subreddit_id": "t5_2ss9z"}, {"author": "tan-xs", "body": "If you\u2019re wanting to know how to say \u201chi\u201d in Chinese, it\u2019s \u201c\u4f60\u597d.\"", "created_utc": "1666039005.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ispwlvp", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_y6dhg8", "parent_id": "t3_y6dhg8", "score": "1", "subreddit": "translator", "subreddit_id": "t5_2ss9z"}, {"author": "tan-xs", "body": "It actually doesn\u2019t.

Mostly, I was interested in foreign scripts. I learned the Greek alphabet when I was quite young and made tons of random code alphabets. However, I was always intrigued by Japanese and Chinese, since there was no alphabet, but characters instead. I tried learning Japanese in middle school, but it didn't last long. Then I met a friend who was learning Chinese, and I thought I'd give it a go too (that was in 2015, I was 14 at the time). \n\nI didn't think I was going to be interested in learning Chinese for more than a few weeks, but it turned into months and a year. Seeing my interest in the language, my parents decided to help me pursue this and signed me up for one on one lessons at a Confucius Institute. I took those basically through the end of high school, at which point I had passed HSK 5. I was interested in studying Chinese-English translation, and heard of the Chinese Government Scholarship, so I signed up for it through the Confucius Institute and got the scholarship. Went to Beijing to start uni in 2019.\n\nJanuary 2020, I decided to come home for the winter holidays, which is the same time which Covid blew up, which has resulted in me taking my university classes all online for the last two and a half years. I also started working for a small shop in the town where I live owned by Chinese people, so I was still able to practice every day which helped significantly. I just left that job at the end of August this year, and now I'm working at getting my visa to head back to Beijing and finish off my bachelor's degree on campus.\n\nFor me, I think I was able to carry basic conversations when I was around 3-4 years in. This was mostly because I had very few interactions with native speakers (my Chinese lessons were only once every two weeks), but I did expose myself to it as much as I could. Once I graduated high school and went to university, I made amazingly fast progress (as you would expect). \n\nAs for tips and tricks, the only thing I can really say is to immerse yourself in it as much as humanly possible. I spent a lot of the first few years doing lots of sentence mining and flashcards. Then, once I had a foundation, I started immersion. I watched lots of Chinese shows and videos, read lots of short stories and articles, listened to Chinese podcasts, and wrote in Chinese whenever I could. I also did lots of translation practice; sometimes I would just pick a random file on my computer or in my room and try translating it into Chinese. I think having done this for the first few years of my learning journey has really helped me.", "created_utc": "1663720763.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ip9oq5x", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_xj32er", "parent_id": "t3_xj32er", "score": "3", "subreddit": "ChineseLanguage", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qyz1"}, {"author": "tan-xs", "body": "She's basically saying that she's too skinny, and that even though she's always eating she's still getting skinnier and she's not sure why.", "created_utc": "1663619231.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ip3yjcw", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_xh9pa1", "parent_id": "t3_xh9pa1", "score": "2", "subreddit": "translator", "subreddit_id": "t5_2ss9z"}, {"author": "tan-xs", "body": "Chinese (\u7b80\u4f53\u4e2d\u6587):\n\n1703\u5e74\u590f\u5929\uff0c\u79f0\u547c\u81ea\u5df1\u4e3a\u4e54\u6cbb\u00b7\u6492\u739b\u7eb3\u672d\u7684\u9752\u5e74\u7537\u4eba\u4e00\u62b5\u8fbe\u4e86\u4f26\u6566\uff0c\u5c31\u5907\u53d7\u6574\u5ea7\u57ce\u5e02\u7684\u9752\u7750\u3002\u4ed6\u58f0\u79f0\u81ea\u5df1\u662f\u798f\u5c14\u6469\u6c99\u5c9b\uff08\u5982\u4eca\u53f0\u6e7e\uff09\u4eba\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u7688\u4f9d\u4e86\u5723\u516c\u5b97\u3002\u4eba\u4eba\u90fd\u60f3\u4e0e\u4ed6\u89c1\u9762\u3002\u6709\u4eba\u8ba4\u4e3a\uff0c\u8fd9\u4f4d\u5916\u56fd\u4eba\u4e0d\u8fc7\u662f\u6765\u81ea\u53e6\u4e00\u534a\u5730\u7403\u7684\u65b0\u5f02\u5947\u89c2\uff1b\u4ed6\u8bf4\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u8c01\u90fd\u542c\u4e0d\u61c2\uff0c\u4ed6\u7684\u4e0e\u4eba\u4e0d\u540c\u4ee4\u4eba\u60ca\u8be7\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5403\u751f\u8089\uff0c\u4ed6\u8fd8\u8bb2\u4e86\u98df\u4eba\u4e3b\u4e49\u548c\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7ae5\u796d\u7684\u9a87\u4eba\u542c\u95fb\u7684\u6545\u4e8b\u3002\u53e6\u6709\u4eba\u8ba4\u4e3a\uff0c\u4ed6\u662f\u9c9c\u4e3a\u4eba\u77e5\u7684\u798f\u5c14\u6469\u6c99\u5c9b\uff0c\u4e43\u81f3\u6574\u4f53\u795e\u79d8\u4e9a\u6d32\u7684\u7b2c\u4e00\u624b\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u5b9d\u8d35\u8d44\u6e90\u2026\u2026  \n\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u5b9e\u9645\u4e0a\u4e54\u6cbb\u00b7\u6492\u739b\u7eb3\u672d\u662f\u4e2a\u9a97\u5b50\u3002\u4ed6\u7684\u76ae\u80a4\u662f\u767d\u8272\u7684\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u6839\u636e\u8d77\u7801\u4e00\u4e2a\u6d88\u606f\u6765\u6e90\uff0c\u4ed6\u7684\u5934\u53d1\u662f\u91d1\u9ec4\u8272\u7684\u3002\u4ed6\u4ece\u672a\u53bb\u8fc7\u5fb7\u56fd\u4ee5\u4e1c\u7684\u5730\u533a\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u636e\u6211\u4eec\u6240\u77e5\uff0c\u4ed6\u539f\u6765\u6765\u81ea\u6cd5\u56fd\u3002\u4ed6\u771f\u5b9e\u7684\u8eab\u4efd\u5374\u6ca1\u6709\u88ab\u4eba\u53d1\u73b0\u3002  \n\u4ed6\u5230\u8fbe\u4f26\u6566\u7684\u4e2a\u628a\u6708\u540e\uff0c\u4ed6\u64b0\u5199\u4e86\u5173\u4e8e\u4ed6\u201c\u7956\u56fd\u201d\u7684\u4e00\u672c\u4e66\uff0c\u540d\u4e3a\u300a\u798f\u5c14\u6469\u6c99\u5386\u53f2\u4e0e\u5730\u7406\u7684\u63cf\u8ff0\u300b\uff0c\u5185\u5bb9\u975e\u5e38\u6709\u8da3\uff0c\u8bb2\u4e9a\u6d32\u4e60\u4fd7\u9887\u53d7\u5947\u5e7b\u4e1c\u65b9\u4e3b\u4e49\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u4ed6\u8fd8\u53d7\u542f\u53d1\u5c06\u6559\u5802\u63a2\u9898\u7ffb\u8bd1\u6210\u201c\u798f\u5c14\u6469\u6c99\u8bed\u201d\uff0c\u540e\u6765\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7ed9\u4f26\u6566\u4e3b\u6559\u52a0\u5165\u5230\u4ed6\u6536\u85cf\u4e2d\u3002\u300a\u798f\u5c14\u6469\u6c99\u5386\u53f2\u4e0e\u5730\u7406\u7684\u63cf\u8ff0\u300b\u5145\u6ee1\u7740\u6709\u5173\u798f\u5c14\u6469\u6c99\u7687\u5e1d\u3001\u795e\u50cf\u5d07\u62dc\u3001\u796d\u7940\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u7ae5\u796d\uff09\u3001\u8282\u65e5\u3001\u5a5a\u59fb\u3001\u6559\u80b2\u3001\u996e\u98df\u4e60\u60ef\u3001\u97f3\u4e50\u3001\u8d38\u6613\u4ee5\u53ca\u4f17\u6240\u5468\u77e5\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u53d9\u4e8b\uff0c\u751a\u81f3\u5305\u542b\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u8bed\u6cd5\u548c\u798f\u5c14\u6469\u6c99\u8bed\u8bd1\u7248\u7684\u300a\u4e3b\u7977\u6587\u300b\u3001\u300a\u4f7f\u5f92\u4fe1\u7ecf\u300b\u548c\u300a\u5341\u8beb\u300b\u3002", "created_utc": "1663618386.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ip3wk4f", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_x3mat3", "parent_id": "t3_x3mat3", "score": "1", "subreddit": "translator", "subreddit_id": "t5_2ss9z"}, {"author": "tan-xs", "body": "!id:zh", "created_utc": "1663559210.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ip0sryq", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_xhyqyq", "parent_id": "t1_ip0jkki", "score": "1", "subreddit": "translator", "subreddit_id": "t5_2ss9z"}, {"author": "tan-xs", "body": "!id:zh\n\nThe top row says \u201cXinjianguo (lit.

Knowing a lot of characters will help you to understand how words are constructed, and will help you to guess the meaning of a lot of words you may have never met before.

For example, if I came across a word like \u52fe\u5f15, I would first understand the meanings of the individual characters (\u52fe means hook, \u5f15 means to guide) and then find a way to connect them together with the meaning of the word. In this case, I would think of a hook waiting to snatch someone up and lead them into something else (\u52fe\u5f15 = to tempt, to entice). That way, not only have I learned a new word, I've also learned 2 characters.

However, probably the best analogy between English sentence structures and Chinese structures that I\u2019ve seen so far is that English is like a bunch of grapes, and Chinese is like taking the grapes and putting them in a line. English has a better defined grammar, so it can take on more complicated and convoluted sentence structures without losing too much ambiguity, whereas Chinese relies heavily on context and therefore needs to be written in such a way that ideas are clearly laid out one next to the other.
