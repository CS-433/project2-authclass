I love those kinds of dramas. Triangles always leave me frustrated.\n\n- **Because This Is My First Life**. Guarantee you're going to get this one recommended a lot in this thread, and for good reason. While there is technically a SML who causes some jealousy with the ML, it's not what I'd call a classic triangle. Spoiler if you'd really like to know: >!By the end you find that he wasn't even really interested in the FL, and turned out to be a good friend and a sweet guy. He's mostly there to push the ML into addressing his feelings.!< This is pretty low-conflict, it's mostly internal. All the characters go through a lot of growth. It's easy to love basically the entire cast of characters. It will give you the warm and fuzzies, and is a pretty good follow-up to EAW, I think.\n\n- **Her Private Life**. Another one I bet you'll see recommended more than once. It's just plain fun. It has so many funny moments. The FL's best friend is still the cutest human being I've ever seen in any drama, I adored her and she stole many scenes she was in. The idol that the FL is obsessed with was also a down-to-earth sweetheart. The ML is one of the best I've seen in terms of being mature and reasonable when it comes to the FL. I won't spoil exactly how or when he finds out about her obsession, or what his specific reaction is. I will just say that (not a massive spoiler but still wanna be safe, it does give some of it away), >!he acted like a decent human being who clearly cared about her more than any judgments towards what society deemed immature.!< It can be hard to avoid toxic traits in the MLs of kdramas, too often they lean far too much into jealousy and immaturity. Ryan, the ML, was very refreshing. ALSO it's got such a hot kiss!\n\n- **The Legend of the Blue Sea**. This one I don't rank as highly as the above but it is still a really cool story and had many sweet moments. It does have a fair bit of melodrama (and an insane crying scene by Lee Min Ho that haunts me to this day, you might laugh through it like I did \ud83d\ude05). You get some cartoonish villains like the stepmother, but then you get the storyline with the ML's mother which has a moment that had me so genuinely touched. It is handy to learn a little more about Korean culture and how divorce & single parents are handled. Otherwise the mother's choice might not make sense. Once you have context it does make sense and it's really affecting. Unfortunately we DO get some of that toxicity from the ML but not nearly as bad as some, I made it through just fine.\n\n- **Romance is a Bonus Book**. This is a gold-standard in kdrama-land when it comes to sweet, fun, lighthearted shows. The FL is still one of my favorite characters. The first episode is damn hard to watch when it comes to her and her situation - my heart kept breaking more and more. But that makes it all the sweeter when things turn around for her, and I love her persistence and deep love for her daughter. I didn't personally feel much chemistry between her and the ML, but it wasn't distracting for me, just didn't give me butterflies. I know it does for many others though and their relationship is quite healthy, which is really nice.\n\n- **My Holo Love**. It's been a couple years since I've seen this. But from what I recall it's very sweet and fun, it's a mini-series at just 12 episodes (most kdramas are 16 or 20 eps). Now technically a love triangle of sorts is the crux of the show. But it's a bit complicated as the ML is a tech genius who has developed an incredible AI hologram who just so happens to look exactly like him. As I said I really don't like triangles either, so I wouldn't recommend this unless I felt the setup was not gonna give you the same frustrations as a classic triangle would. It has some melodrama to it but also a good amount of comedy, and was just a very easy watch!\n\nHope this helps - welcome to the world of Kdrama!\n\nP.S.

Except that there's a sexual assault NO ONE mentions. Spoilers: >!The SML rapes the SFL but the show doesn't portray it that way. What happens is that she gets blackout drunk. He is stone cold sober. They meet on the street and she's so drunk she can barely even control her body. She kisses him and next thing you know she's waking up in his bed the next day. She can't remember what happened, she's clearly humiliated and upset, and puts all the blame on herself. Essentially scolding herself for being too \"easy\". This is rape by all definitions. She was incapable of giving consent. He took advantage of her drunken state, and CLEARLY she wasn't actually ready to have sex.

I do disagree with the idea that anyone who is a victim of abuse should force themselves to continue a relationship with their abusers just because they share DNA. Family is earned. Biology means nothing.\n\nIt's a dangerous game to urge abuse survivors to go back on their decisions in cutting off those who hurt them and WILL want to keep hurting them, because why would they stop? We should respect that decision. Only the survivor knows how best to handle their relationships with their abusers.\n\nSo again I do get where you're coming from but I would urge you to avoid suggesting an abuse survivor keep up a relationship simply because they share blood.

I only got on medication a few months ago. So I absolutely know what it feels like to be un- or under-medicated and dealing with a baby on top of it. (also it's extremely common for ADHD meds to change in efficacy even just because of our period, let alone how out of whack it all gets post natal, so you're not alone with that.)\n\nEveryone finds what works for them. you have your own life and your own situation, so I can't necessarily give advice that will fit you perfectly. But as someone who has been in your boat, allow me to just share a little in hopes of making you feel better. I know that I wish I had this community way back then.\n\nYou will never regret not doing the dishes because you took care of your child. You'll never regret not doing the laundry or being more organized. When you look back, what you want to remember is all those precious moments you had. None of the rest matters.\n\nSome people don't thrive in clutter (some people like myself do find clutter anxiety-reducing but it's not like for all ADHDers). And there's so much you need, all the time, when caring for a child. So saying \"f**k the house, I'll hold my baby\" isn't a genuine practical long-term solution and I'd be doing you a disservice if I pretended it was. That's just a baseline, a way to approach it that can help bring you peace.\n\nSo what I did was make a list of priorities. Baby stuff was first. A place for diapers, a place for pacifiers or bottles, a place for snuggly blankets, etc. Then I found a brightly colored container or bag for each one. I wrote a list on my fridge so I could reference it - so let's say I think, Where the hell are the diapers? Check the fridge, okay they're in the yellow box. Now they're much easier to find. Try to remove as many steps as you can!\n\nAfter that I could decide what was and wasn't important. Do I need to fold and put away my clothing, or can I just leave it in this basket, and instead just put away the baby's clothes? I put small trash cans everyyyywhere so that it was easy to throw things away rather than litter my floor as I tend to do.\n\nI also kept 3-4 notebooks around the house. this made it easier to jot down any important things that I knew I might forget, which of course there's always your phone as well but for me personally it can be a lot simpler if it's a simple as grab paper, put a pen to it.\n\nMy partner has ADHD too so we worked really hard on this. I still lost things all the time, I still cried doing chores, I still had a million moments of Mom frustration *and* ADHD frustration. So I made sure to reach out to people I knew would get it like my own mother or my disabled best friend who has 4 kids, and my therapist (which not everyone can afford I realize.)\n\nBut when I wanted to beat myself up, berate myself, ask myself why I wasn't better or this & that. I would either look at my daughter if she was nearby or I'd look at a photo of her. And told myself, Okay if you want to do this, fine. Go ahead. But you have to look at her while you do it and imagine you are saying those things to her. I had to be careful with that because it could trigger guilt and not make me feel better. I had backup plans and sometimes I did beat myself up and just not look at her. No one is perfect.\n\nBut I tried my best. And a good 70% of the time, it worked. And not because I felt guilty for wanting to berate myself. But because looking at her reminded (I should say reminds, present tense, cuz this is still a struggle!!) me that I was once an innocent child too, just doing her best. The older my kid gets the more she looks like me. I have this one photo frame that allows for two photos side-by-side. So I have one of me when I was 5 and one of her now. And it reminds me that I'm doing my best, I've always done my best, and that I want to treat that inner child the same way I treat my own child.\n\nI know you didn't ask for any of this but your comment really flashed me back and I would rather over-share than miss a chance to make someone feel positive. I know you are doing your best. Remember to be kind to yourself, try to make practical tools for yourself (lists can help a lot, even if you lose them like me) and just hug that little baby as much as you can.

While trans people are not a monolith, and there is no single spokesperson, I still wanted to get his take. Since I can't really comment in an informed way but he can. He told me I can go ahead and paste his answer in. I think you raised a great question that deserves consideration, hence my efforts here! His response:\n\n\"A valid point. Historically, gender swap stories have been/can be polarizing amongst trans people. It depends on context, too. Sometimes it's the best that that show/time period/country could offer in terms of trans rep; sometimes it's used for cheap laughs and is completely transphobic. Many trans people adore Mulan or even realized they are trans by watching the movie, even though it's not meant to be about that, not from the outside anyway. But lots of them, myself included, this was our first exposure to seeing a person of one gender choose to change their appearance, name, and social status into that more aligned with another gender. It was like, 'Wait, I can DO that?!' So was that good or bad, if it wasn't \"*really*\" meant as a trans story? \n\nI haven't seen this show and don't watch kdramas as much as you would love me to lol, but I do watch anime (Ranma 1/2 anyone??) and as you know I'm also very familiar with East Asian culture as a whole. It seems really likely that within that traditional culture, this was as close as they get. I mean, from what you've told me they never even have queer storylines, practically never right? But that doesn't mean queer people don't exist in Korea. Maybe some trans people watch this and enjoy it as a trans, queer narrative. Maybe this is as far as Korea has got so far, in terms of what they can/will portray.\n\nSo I guess my answer is that...on surface level, it doesn't bother me and I don't think it is inherently erasing the trans experience. From the synopsis and trailer you sent. I'd have to see it to really judge. But the plot idea alone of 'man in woman's body pretending to be a woman and developing a relationship with a man' is not a new one and not something that erases my experience per se. I guess that's it lol?\"\n\nSo like I said, he doesn't speak for everyone. But his POV was valuable to me, because I can't really say if it erases trans experiences when Im a cis person. I'd say I tend to agree with him, in that context matters, and that Korea is still SO conservative that maybe this was the best they could do at the time. I would really have to watch it before I decided my own take.\n\nI think you raised a good point and that this is a good discussion point. Raising questions about something that may or may not disrespect queer people is never a bad thing in my view.\n\nEdit for grammar", "created_utc": "1662842656.0", "edited": "False", "id": "inwhf7h", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_xajmkk", "parent_id": "t1_inwahzm", "score": "2", "subreddit": "kdramarecommends", "subreddit_id": "t5_31t53"}, {"author": "dontddoitannie", "body": "This mother and her child seem to show great love towards one another here.

Yeah i seem to have assumed from your comment you were bi! My bad, but thats cool! Bisexuality also means attraction to any gender, outside of men and women, but I wasn't sure whether you were saying that's a difference or not. So i don't want to assume again! My partner thinks they're enby, although they aren't sure yet. For now we use they/them and its the label that fits them. And ofc I'm bi. So this conversation led to an interesting cross-section haha.\n\nI hope you dont mind if I babble for a moment because when you said you were enby it reminded me of some concepts on the gender binary that bisexuals lead the charge on starting in the 70s. And as someone with a nonbinary partner, having these as part of our history just, I dont know how to describe it I'm sorry. It has just helped me support THEM as we both explore who we really are (we were raised Christian and homophobic so we are only just beginning to accept things we've known our whole lives.) So I know just how hard it can be to be enby. How similar to bisexuality it is, in terms of people mislabelling it or even refusing to learn more about it. So I thought it might be a nice thing to share some stuff I came across long ago, that also was useful for me and my partner.\n\nI had to look these up to be sure I got them right. It's so nerdy to start quoting books in a reddit comment  \ud83d\ude2dA book I recommend highly is called The Anything That Moves Manifesto, and this quote is my favorite and always in my heart. \"Do not assume that bisexuality is binary or duogamous in nature: that we have \u2018two\u2019 sides or that we must be involved simultaneously with both genders to be fulfilled human beings. In fact, don\u2019t assume that there are only two genders.\u201d Second volume of that book said, \"What your mother probably never told you is that not everyone is 100% female or 100% male. Many of us may have two or more personas or parts of our personalities that transcend traditional gender constraints and roles.\"\n\nOk just one more from another book and I'm done haha. It's a 1995 book (also another great read on queer history) called The Natural Next Step. \"We teach genderfuck when we talk about our lives without gendered pronouns, bulldozing people\u2019s assumptions about sexuality and gender.\"\n\nBisexuals have always been open to people outside the binary and I hope that those people could feel like we might be a safe space in particular. One might be about gender and the other sexuality, but there is just so much in common!\n\nAlso just wanna be sure this is totally clear, I have no issue with pansexuals. My very best friend in the world is pan, though she has considered moving to bi but at the moment that's how she and her daughter identify. And it's honestly really great because we relate on everything. The words are different but the concepts on gender and sexuality are the same. And we can just enjoy our conversations and our similarities and neither of us want to fight about a label.\n\nI find most pansexuals I've come across are all lovely people who don't have any harm in their heart and who are simply living their lives as they see fit, which I respect and love. I think it's more the overall concept and root of where it came from, and how the label and ones like it have (surely unintentionally) changed the way bisexuality was defined. Much of the supposed progression away from 'limiting' bisexuality took away, in many cases, all of our history in regards to the gender binary. And now most people dont not only know about that, they dont even know the actual definition of bisexuality. I don't blame that on pansexuality though. I hope it doesnt come across that way. It's more that I wish there was more education on it and I wish that in the last 15 or so years bisexuality has gone back on so much progress made, because of misinformation. So pansexuality is more just a side aspect?\n\nMy main point being. I hope over time the queer community as a whole can really start to understand each other better. All the in-fighting distracts from our overall goals of acceptance and battling phobias of all kinds. And also, the main reason I wrote something so long, was because I *hope* that there were things in here that made you feel accepted and encouraged. That we're in a similar boat and that I respect you, accept you, I know secondhand what the nonbinary experience can be like, and I hope that you continue to live the way that makes you happy, regardless of genders or sexualities or anything. I feel a little weird with this comment and have considered abandoning it a couple times but my hope that it might be encouraging outweighs the awkwardness. Hope that's the case.

Let alone the constant misinformation. While I do not have issue with anyones labels because that's their business, at the same time the rise of pansexuality has kinda hurt us considering we have the same definition. \"Attraction regardless of gender.\" That's it.

The smaller they are, the more likely they'll form curls.\n\nYou can see a big difference between the 1930s (which is my favorite time period even though it's not nearly as popular as 40s-50s, in terms of style) and the following two decades, in large part because they had more individual curls. Whereas 40s-50s, they started to brush those curls into larger waves and rolls. It's the difference between Ginger Rogers and Marilyn Monroe, for example.\n\nThe way I achieve a 1930s look does include the brush out, yes, but also how I curl. I will use very small foam rollers on the bottom half of my hair, and pin curls on the top half. So I get more wave on top and more curls on bottom. So you might be making your curls too small for your end goal.\n\nDoes your hair look more like this: [example 1](https://d2fzf9bbqh0om5.cloudfront.net/blog/posts/original/8142.png), [example 2](https://image.glamourdaze.com/2018/06/1930s-hairstyles-three-daily-couffures-Bette-Davis-500x355.jpg) or these [ex 1](https://hair-and-makeup-artist.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/1950s-Marilyn-soft-bob.jpg), [ex 2](https://i.pinimg.com/564x/52/c7/a4/52c7a4c03ee076059be5b489a465e5e3.jpg)?

The nice thing for US is we aren't limited to sticking to one era, even on the same head of hair. We can combine things and attack the beast using modern techniques sometimes too. Unless you're going for complete accuracy, you don't have to stick to one era for your hairstyle. But it \\*is\\* helpful to know what comes from what, so that you can understand how to achieve your goals.\n\nSorry for such a long reply but I saw it's been 2 weeks and you hadn't got a response, so I wanted to be as helpful as I could.

Doing it because of embarrassment, especially if you've found a community you like here, might not be the answer IMO. We've all got silly things we do and like. \n\nTake me and Snapchat for example. When my little brother was old enough finally for his parents to give him permission to have it I downloaded it as well, as he lives a few hours away from me so we only see each other monthly. Texting and snap let us stay in touch, and snap was especially nice because we got to actually SEE each other. \n\nAnd several years ago they had lenses that were games. You'd do a round, snap a pic, send it, they'd do the same, and so on. And they were REALLY fun. Before we knew it we had a several hundred day streak going, all because of the games. So for fun, and no other reason than just to say we did it, we decided to go for a 1,000 day streak. \n\nA lot happened over those 1,000 days. Many days it was hard to remember but one of us would always text the other to say, \"You haven't done Snap yet!!\" There were hospital stays where I had to ask my husband to do something for me so we \"didn't lose the streak.\" I had a child during that time and I'd set little reminders so that even on busy days I wouldn't forget. I was a 30-something adult in a hospital who was concerned with their snapchat streak! A mother with an infant to care for setting reminders for it! pretty dumb. But it was because it kept me connected with a special person. \n\nWe've still never broken the streak and as of today we are at 1,400 days. That's about 2 months shy of 4 years of never missing a single day. It's silly, maybe some might call it embarrassing. Im sure one day something will happen and we will miss it or give it up. But until that day...our new goal is for 5,000 days. My kid would be a teenager herself by then. Im sure we won't make it lol but we will try.\n\nSo. A bit of a long story but I really wanted to make my point that #1 you have nothing to feel silly about if you compare to my far sillier snapchat streak lol, and #2 I think you should  delete it if it does not make you happy, if it makes you stressed or you don't enjoy your time here, if you aren't getting the support you need, or if the support doesn't outweigh the stress. Delete it if it interferes with work or functioning, or with your IRL relationships, or keeps you from doing hobbies you love.\n\nBut if none of those things are true, and it makes you happy, you enjoy your time here, you can still get things done in life - don't let simple embarrassment ruin that. People with ADHD, we tend to be really hard on ourselves. If this is you being hard on yourself, go gentler.\n\nI hope this helps. I know whatever choice you make will be the right one, because I trust that you know exactly what is best for you. Im just a stranger. My only point is to assure you that if you don't WANT to leave and it's not harming you, you don't have to, because lots of people out there are doing FAR sillier things \u2764\ufe0f\n\nedit for grammar", "created_utc": "1661031430.0", "edited": "1661032489.0", "id": "il47g58", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_wt6xl6", "parent_id": "t3_wt6xl6", "score": "5", "subreddit": "ADHD", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qnwb"}, {"author": "dontddoitannie", "body": "That worked for you??

It's very hard to see.\n\nStigma is intense with personality disorders. I accepted my bipolar, PTSD, and ADHD just fine. But I ran from the BPD label for years, because I was so afraid of the stigma. I also don't have any of the symptoms regarding interpersonal relationships, all of mine have been pretty healthy and don't match it at all, so that made it easier for me to run from the diagnosis.

I decided to look at the light and funny side. Made jokes to my partner about both me and her in diapers lol. That helped me not get overwhelmed by thinking it was embarrassing or lame or anything.\n\n4 years later and I do sometimes still get such a tense pelvic floor that the urge to bear down happens again, and that's when I go see my PT or use some of the tools/tricks I learned from it.

It's funny, personally Ive been lucky because 99% of the time when I would talk about the neurodiversity concept with someone, they were mostly my autistic brother's circle of friends and were super reasonable and easy to have real discourse with.\n\nthey've got a similar idea to how I see the whole shebang - I can have compassion for my brain, not hate myself and not hate my brain either because it's doing the best it can, and also seek treatment. They shouldn't be mutually exclusive. When I talk to people with autism and ADHD about that subject they're always sharing tips and ideas on how to cope with all the negative side effects. All my autistic/ADHD/similar friends and acquaintances have been very adamant about people finding ways to live in a world that will never fully adjust to meet their comfort levels.\n\nLike - here are ways to deal with sensory issues, emotional regulation, concentration, how to communicate with people etc. So generally when I had heard the term neurodiversity it's what I thought of.\n\nThen I naively trot out into other corners of the internet and come across strangers rather than friends, and discover there are people taking it so far, for example, that they won't even do something simple like noise cancelling headphones because it implies there's something wrong with them. So that has been super frustrating, I don't interact with those people but I see their essays and tweets and think pieces and it is so so aggravating.\n\nSorry to go off.
