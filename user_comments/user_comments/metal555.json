Alternatively, the suffix can function as a momentane aspect marker, i.e. a sudden action/change of state, an action that happens one time without repetition, so the title name can also mean \u201cthe sudden feeling\u201d, \u201cfelt \\[it\\]\u201d, etc. There could be more interpretations though, those are just my understandings of the suffix!!<", "created_utc": "1644077919.0", "edited": "1644080130.0", "id": "hvpnoy5", "is_submitter": "True", "link_id": "t3_slalu3", "parent_id": "t3_slalu3", "score": "10", "subreddit": "conlangs", "subreddit_id": "t5_2red7"}, {"author": "metal555", "body": "I\u2019ve heard the YPG is good for kurdish", "created_utc": "1643937453.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hvi1n2b", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_sjot1s", "parent_id": "t3_sjot1s", "score": "2", "subreddit": "languagelearningjerk", "subreddit_id": "t5_37rt5"}, {"author": "metal555", "body": "What interests do you have for those languages?

I\u2019m someone that joined Viossa in August 2020.\n\nYou might also find interesting things from [this reddit post](https://www.google.ca/amp/s/amp.reddit.com/r/conlangs/comments/3y2yek/viossa_an_experimental_pidgin_one_year_in_the/) that was posted after just a year of viossaing; the founders of the languages spoke viossa back them daily, and so people were starting to communicate and a functioning base were already forming.\n\nTo give you an idea, a song that was translated back in 2015 (around a few weeks after the premier of viossa) is basically still mostly comprehensible, with words that are still recognizable (albeit the grammar, because of it being in poetry, might be harder to understand)\n\nIn terms of Viossa changing overtime, there\u2019s definitely words that changes meaning, words that are rare, words that went obsolete, and words that were previously obsolete, but now are back and living. Also grammar changes and innovations are constantly happening as well.\n\nAnd you also asked the right community, because I was a founding member of a [different conpidgin called \u201cNupishin\u201d](https://www.google.ca/amp/s/amp.reddit.com/r/conlangs/comments/9u6sew/nupishin_an_introduction/) - which is a **priori** conpidgin. Unfortunately, Nupishin has now quiet down and not been spoken a lot, but we had a call every week to speak Nupishin and to make new words/grammar, as well as discussing (in nupishin) sometimes, getting to know each other, etc. I\u2019ll give my perspectives for Nupishin for your questions, and hopefully someone else who was in viossa when viossa started could provide further insight for Viossa specifically.\n\n1. Nupishin was organized on a discord server named \u201cAnarchylangs\u201d, which was a server for all people who wanted to collab on conlangs. We had around 10 or more members at the start, and we basically all joined a voice call when we started it and... it was quiet for a minutes, but then I was trying to introduce new words and so people all just started to create new grammar and words. What happened in the first call __stayed with Nupishin and overall was the foundation of Nupishin__. \n\n2. Nupishin was just slowly created, and expanded when we get new people and teach them, and then for all of us to make new words, and etc etc. There was no need for organization in terms for Nupishin. It just organically worked, if that makes sense. Nupishin didn\u2019t see as much changes as Viossa, but there are noticeable big changes between the way different Nupishin speakers use the language (the same way that Viossa speakers all use/speak/write the language differently).\n\n3. honestly you could communicate a lot in Nupishin within a few weeks/months of its development. Note that we had only a call every week, with sometime in between to chat in text; for viossa, when there were calls everyday etc, the language probably formed extremely fast and got a base maybe around 2 weeks or a month.\n\nIn terms of modern Viossa, though, there\u2019s already big changes between what I have learned back in August 2020 and what is spoken by some other viossa speakers, and what is being taught to new learners. For one, people sometimes understand things differently, or maybe they innovate things, or maybe misread/mistyped/misunderstood/misheard something that just stayed with their viossa, and that drives the changes that happen to viossa right now. I know that Viossa in its 3rd/4th/5th year of being was not heavily spoken as today, so that might have caused Viossa to not be changed as much as how viossa\u2019s changing today. \n\nIn short: The more time the group spends on the conpidgin, the more quickly the conpidgin will settle down and have a base. The base then with new members and discussion and with voice calls and freedom/creativity etc. will start to change/expand the conpidgin (sometimes artificially though), and then when the conpidgin receives new members, sometimes they learn of the changes and start to use them (which then becomes the \u201cnew variety of the conpidgin\u201d). And of course, the opposite can happen, where features die because the people who used to have them did not teach them and pass them down. **The conpidgin (with enough people and passion) WOULD become a living entity/language at some point.**\n\nIf you have any questions about what I said, please ask!

Like [Viossa](https://www.reddit.com/r/conlangs/comments/3y2yek/viossa_an_experimental_pidgin_one_year_in_the/), we tried to not use English and made words and grammar as we needed. We succeeded on doing that, we have **~300 to 400 words, and grammar**, enough to start off with simple daily life topics. Maybe it\u2019s not what you considered as \u201cfluent\u201d, but oh well. We have (currently) ~5 or 6 members that are (recently) active, **so you do have people to talk to!**\n\nWe used visuals and pictures to first start off with initial grammar and vocab, and as we progress we start speaking more in Nupishin with each other! So you\u2019re basically **learning a language from immersion**.\n\nThe toughest part is that we have a lot of idiolects/dialects. These can differ greatly between person to person(phonology, orthography...), but overall we can all understand each other through practice and speaking to each other. **So you\u2019re learning Nupishin, but in a way, you\u2019re making your own conlect of it**.\n\n**This is a voice call project though (at least at first as a newcomer)**, you don\u2019t need to speak, but as long as you can hear us, it\u2019s fine.\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in trying out an immersion based approach with language learning, visit us at our discord server and I can answer questions you have about our project!  \n\nBut like I said, your question is very hard to answer...

I also have Danish and Uzbek textbooks, those will be my experiments and along with Spanish I want to get maybe A2~B1, just languages I can experiment with haha.\n\nAnd don't get me started on languages like Navajo, Tibetan, Mongolian and Burmese, but unfortunately that'll take me a life time haha\n\n>Otherwise: practice transcribing things in the IPA. Start by transcribing your own speech; when you get comfortable with that, try transcribing the speech of people who have different accents from yours, and/or speak a language that you are familiar with but non-native in; if you get really comfortable with that, try transcribing the speech of people speaking a language that you're not familiar with.\n\nOh yeah definitely! My parents speak Fuzhounese (Min Dong Chinese-American) with 7 tones and a lot of vowels so maybe listening to them and write IPA? hahaha\n\n\n>Also, depending on what subfields of linguistics you think you might be interested in going into, it could be really worthwhile to work on your abilities with different computer programs now, while you can do it at your leisure and can afford to take the time to make mistakes and re-do things, rather than when it becomes critically important for an assignment or research paper down the road.\n\nHmm I'm most interested in maybe historical linguistics and field linguistics, but phonetics and pragmatics sound pretty fun as well! I'll definitely look into those.\n\n>I know I've veered very much away from the category of \"activities\" you originally asked for, but hopefully something in here might strike some inspiration for you!\n\nNah nah you were so helpful! Thanks so much!\n\nAlso, could you give me some textbook suggestions of linguistics? Specifically grammar and syntax? Reading features like \"Austronesian Alignment\", \"Theta Roles\", \"Antipassive\", etc is a bit hard to digest through haha.\n\nEdit: Seems like the closest University to me doesn't have linguistics... Though there is one that's ~30 minutes away to get there by car, and woah it has a lot of classes that I wanna get in, like Old English, Irish Gaelic, and ASL?

But I found the project to be interesting and so we started on November 2017 our first call and bam.\n\n>How did it work? What were your rules?\n\nIt was a Viossa-like project, except we didn't use any natlangs as our base, the language was essentially from what we wanted to have. We added some natlang words as an easter egg like (vadefakk - from what the fuck, v\u00e5ge from wug, etc.) and some actual loanwords because I thought it would be fun to add some of those natlang words.\n\nThe rules were that barely any English should be used to explain grammar concepts, only pictures, emojis, or in language descriptions are allowed. We allowed others to make their own ideolects or dialects, so we have some diverging sounds and grammar points, and preference to use some stuff over others. Later we had a rule which discouraged us to purposefully add differences so we have different ideolects, but rather to have it happen naturally like a pidgin/creole would.\n\n>In what ways is it different from other similar projects?\n\nIt is different from Viossa because 1) it didn't use any natlangs to use as a base and 2) our philosophy was more like \"if we can explain a concept and people can start using it, it's part of the lang.\" We ended up with nom-accus and agglutinative, but if someone were to be able to introduce erg-abs alignment for example, Nupishin could look very different.\n\n>Would you consider it a success? It certainly had something of a following (how many?)\n\nI would consider it a success, it was able to survive a year, but I would've wanted it to survive longer with a bigger group of contributors. We started off with possibly 20 people interested, but as we went along a lot of the members lost interest, or couldn't keep up with the vocab and grammar, etc. and so we had about 4~7 active people before they eventually died off as well due to real life reasons.\n\n>What were its shortcomings?\n\nThe appeal to learn it, because Nupishin has a lot of words and for a beginner trying to learn a couple hundred words and grammar without English, it could be daunting and probably dissuaded a lot of potential learners. Though I loved this idea of being immersed in the language.\n\nI would also say we could've had more sessions to practice our vocab and grammar, since we only focused really on adding more words and not practicing the words and grammar we had made.\n\nOverall, it was a messy project that could've benefited from more planning, but it was a fun project.", "created_utc": "1559493806.0", "edited": "False", "id": "eptng41", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_brgiwm", "parent_id": "t1_eptix1h", "score": "1", "subreddit": "conlangs", "subreddit_id": "t5_2red7"}, {"author": "metal555", "body": "Yeah I would gladly talk about Nupishin!
