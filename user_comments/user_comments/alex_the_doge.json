That will create a barrier on top of your paint so it won\u2019t rub off on everything it touches.\n\nI see. Yeah, a friend of mine also thought that having a sealer of some sort would have been the best move. She recommended a product called **setting spray** (but I don't know if setting spray and sealer are the same thing). So I went on Amazon IT and picked up this product: [Makeup Revolution Pro Fix Setting and Illuminating Spray for make-up](https://www.amazon.it/gp/product/B06XX4NWSS/ref=ox_sc_act_title_1?smid=A1JIF0JHRTPAWI&psc=1).\n\n>Since I don\u2019t know what you have available at your local stores I\u2019ll list the general types of face paint, some examples, and their pros and cons:\n\nThat sounds great! I'm all ears, as they say.\n\n>Water-Based/Water-Activated - snazaroo was big among homestucks (it\u2019s what I used), Mehron Paradise, and I think a brand called Wolfe? They\u2019re good for mixing but since they\u2019re water based they can run if you start sweating. Requires a lot of touch ups especially at a hot convention.\n\nAnd, since in Italy weather between September and October can be quite variable and unpredictable, the water-based/water-activated face paint is very likely gonna be a *no*. But I'm still gonna check out those brands you mentioned, just in case they have also other types of face paint outside of this first category.\n\n>Grease paint - Ben nye is the big name here, it\u2019s stage makeup designed to stay on for entire shows under hot stage lights, so sweat won\u2019t be an issue. Some people say it\u2019s heavy though, and might not look as good close up.\n\nI gave a look to some pictures of this grease paint on the web, and, truth be told? I must admit that it kinda doesn't look as good close up. It looks a bit as if it was slightly thick and dusty.\n\n> Other - Pax is a DIY face paint made by mixing other paints with liquid latex. The safety is sketchy, it\u2019s hard to remove, but will definitely stay on all day without rubbing off on anything. \n\nI see. What makes its safety *sketchy* though?\n\n> If you\u2019re still unsure, check out some cosplay face paint guides on YouTube and see what other mettaton cosplayers used and how those turned out. And don\u2019t forget to seal!! \n\nGood point. But nonetheless your previous suggestions are still good.\n\n> Edit: sorry in my excitement I missed the link to the store\u2019s website!\n\nDon't worry, it's no big deal.\n\n>looking through it, I think the Kryolan glamour might be your best bet out of all those options.\n\nHm...It seems to be an interesting choice, especially considering Mettaton's face color is something in between white and light gray, but I'm not so convinced about the product, as the presence of glitter gets mentioned in the description a few times. (But it's also possible I might be misunderstanding the description)\n\n>(I honestly forgot to mention creme makeup because it\u2019s really not good for cosplay, it\u2019s thick, doesn\u2019t seal well, and doesn\u2019t look all that good).\n\nYeah, I have been told the same. And all the cosplayers I follow over the web seem to make use of face paint or some foundation-like product.\n\n>If it\u2019s an option I\u2019d highly recommend looking for some sealer - Ben nye\u2019s sealer or mehron\u2019s barrier spray - online. \n\nI'll make sure to give them a look.", "created_utc": "1556477040.0", "edited": "False", "id": "em00czq", "is_submitter": "True", "link_id": "t3_bi4xua", "parent_id": "t1_elypi9j", "score": "1", "subreddit": "cosplay", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qkju"}, {"author": "alex_the_doge", "body": "Well, it sure is an interesting project.

Yeah, I have tried it already, and noticed that the outcome was exactly like you said it was gonna be.\n\n> To avoid that slight shrinking you can **add what we call 'fencing', 'choker edges' or 'holding edges'**. These are edge loops that you make up close to the edge you want to preserve, and it doesn't smooth as dramatically when you press 3.

Or something completely different?\n\n> I usually tell my students to spend 95% of the time modeling on '1' (unsmoothed) because thats what your model actually looks like. It's often a confusing point for students, because '3' looks better, but is an illusion unless you plan to eventually smooth it twice. \n\nYeah, that's something our teachers taught us too. And that's what I'm doing right now. I plan on smoothing everything to make it look softer later, once I'm done.
