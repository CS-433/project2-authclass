I go to a language school in Tokyo in the mornings (M-F) for 3.5 hours, and in the evenings (2-8) I work at a convenient store. \n\nAt the language school, they\u2019re still going over N2 material, so it\u2019s generally just review for me. In my free time, my routine is to add words (and their example sentences) from [this book](https://www.amazon.in/KANZEN-MASTER-JLPT-TANGO-WORD/dp/488319762X#) and the website/app \u201cSatori Reader\u201d to Anki in the mornings before leaving for school or the evenings after work, and then actually study the cards during my commutes (both while walking and on the train). \n\nI\u2019m currently sacrificing immersion time to focus on the JLPT, with the short lessons in Satori Reader being my only immersion (but it\u2019s very much active study, although I\u2019d argue my time spent at school and work also counts as immersion.\n\nI average around 15 new cards and 140 reviews per day (if we don\u2019t count again or relearning cards) on Anki. This is kind of the sweet spot for me because I generally get through around 70 reviews per commute and don\u2019t want my reviews to bleed into other parts of my day.", "created_utc": "1663846898.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ipgfa28", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_xkdsqb", "parent_id": "t3_xkdsqb", "score": "2", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "Consistent_Cicada65", "body": "I\u2019m referring to the five minutes he\u2019s allowed, which is under the guidance of the homeroom teacher.", "created_utc": "1663754942.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ipb8n3c", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_xjsry8", "parent_id": "t1_ipb8gkt", "score": "2", "subreddit": "teachinginjapan", "subreddit_id": "t5_3c154"}, {"author": "Consistent_Cicada65", "body": "Even in English, that would likely incite a few people to respond, \u201cdon\u2019t \u201cHEY YOU\u201d me.\u201d", "created_utc": "1663747832.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ipb024i", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_xjcwyx", "parent_id": "t1_ip867oe", "score": "1", "subreddit": "LearnJapanese", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qyls"}, {"author": "Consistent_Cicada65", "body": "I don\u2019t think there is a problem with the way he\u2019s teaching.

Most people have trouble staying consistent with them in order to actualize their benefits.\n\nI can\u2019t help people if their problem is a lack of motivation or a resistance to hard work. However, one tip to make studying with flashcards more enjoyable (and thus, easier to be consistent with) is to add audio and visual elements to every card. If you make flashcards from manga, for example, take a picture or screenshot of the actual page in the manga and add it to the flashcard. Then use a TTS to add audio of the sentence on the back (with a definition entry of the word you want to practice more or didn\u2019t know).\n\nAssociating the word with a picture and a sound also helps in creating stronger connections in your brain, which is the key to a better memory. The more connections you create for a single word, the better you will be able to actually use it in conversation.\n\nHowever, one obstacle to doing this is how time consuming it is. It takes a lot of time just to make one card. So one idea you can try is to only make cards on weekends and then do reviews on weekdays. Also, on weekdays, you can just continue doing what you\u2019re already doing now (extensive reading with no look-ups), as that has benefits of its own. A good combination of active study with passive study is probably optimum.\n\nHope that helps.", "created_utc": "1661067100.0", "edited": "False", "id": "il61pcs", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_wtrvxw", "parent_id": "t3_wtrvxw", "score": "7", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "Consistent_Cicada65", "body": "Japanese:\n\nTurtle and tortoise have no distinction as far as I\u2019m aware; they\u2019re both \u30ab\u30e1.\nBut there is a distinction between frog (\u30ab\u30a8\u30eb) and toad (\u30d2\u30ad\u30ac\u30a8\u30eb).", "created_utc": "1660477742.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ik8rg5p", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_wo2vyj", "parent_id": "t3_wo2vyj", "score": "4", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "Consistent_Cicada65", "body": "I also don\u2019t know a way to add fields for each sentence in one go.
