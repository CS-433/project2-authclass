No.\n\nDo you think most people just pick one of the two possible political views sets or what? There are as many political stances as people who have them, you're nothing special. And this both sides talk is really wierd, there are no two sides with set stances, there's a SPECTRUM. Besides, two people who are close on the political spectrum may have completely differing views. \n\n>Ooo, I'm against mainstream use of abortion and that offends you.\n\nNah, just makes me not want to date you. \n\n>Same goes with teaching standard biology in school and not transgenderism and homosexuality. Nothing wrong with that, it gives kids the NECESSARY information, not the arbitrary info they can find out later in life\n\nYou mean avoiding topics that make you uncomfortable? We're supposed to expand kids' horizons not keep them sheltered. \n\n>This is where people act like adults and understand we all won't agree, just like I won't with you now.\n\nAs I'm obviously not expecting you to, I'm still curious why you're afraid to label yourself correctly. If you don't want to talk about it though that's cool, your life and not my business.

It's also not as convenaient. You have to get there, the thrift stores are often dirty and unorganised, you spend hours searching for good items, you need a trained eye and a lot of knowledge, those are things people should be paid for as well, not just the time of work but the time spent gaining skills and knowledge. Then you sort through these stuff, clean it (it's often very gross), fix it (not that easy), take photos, price them (lots of knowledge needed here) describe them etc. \n\nAll this while this person conveniently browses ff sites, gets everything delivered in perfect condition and only has to make one listing for multiple items, since she buys in bulk. If people knew they can buy these clothes directly from these sites and do her \"work\" themeselves would they still be willing to pay her for it?

We were asking were the line or age where stuff was made a bit more ethically and I said maybe around 60s early 70s which is alot closer to \"true vintage\" and the majority of things available by nature of time is 90s.\n\nI literally wrote \"most\" and added that in my opinion it doesn't matter\n\n>I already said the way demand is created is when that vintage stuff has a distinct look or style that these brands still have today or other ff brands copy whether there's a logo or not. That's what the windbreaker example was for, say a nike windbreaker, they still make them today and make retro, not to mention all the ff brands that copy the style. This is just one example but this can be dome with any vintage style regardless of logo, I'm pointing to how ff brands and others copy vintage looks and try to make things look aged artificially. And if only 15% is getting salvaged is that offset by the promotion done for these brands by these vintage pieces. Especially considering that 15% will likely end up in the 85% sooner or later. So again thats why I ask what else\n\nYeah I absolutely agree here. It's horrible that fast fashion brands are trying to capitalise on growing appreciation for vintage clothing. The thing is people like vintage for quality and uniqness, in general traits that fast fashion does not have. I have no influence over other people's choices, if I wore fast fashion that would push people to buy fast fashion more than when I wear vintage clothing that's clearly vintage and not made to look vintage, wouldn't you agree? And yes, all clothing will be thrown away eventually, but better later than sooner. \n\n>Not to mention the world is alot bigger than just the U.S.\n\nI'm not from US, just assumed you were lol\n\nAnd you can find the data easily, I just packed my computer and don't have access to my fonds atm. Most clothing in thrift stores gets thrown/shipped away, just ask anyone who works there. \n\n>This defeats that point when a large portion of that 15% reuse market is priced higher than new stuff it drives ppl to the ff and other driving the industry exploitation further. \n\nNo it's not. Just go to any thrift store and see how much clothing there is. Thrifting is the cheapest option, but if you want someone to do it for you you have to pay them. Otherwise it would be slave labour too.\n\n>I'm just genuinely asking what else could be done in collaboration to increase the percentage salvage, for example textile recycling and reworking, these are all imperfect solutions but together they're better. Ppl often mistake introspection on something to excusing it but its really examinimg a situation for how to improve it\n\nI'm glad you're thinking about these things, makes more of us. Agree here. \n\n>this is consumer recycling talk \"everyone do their part\" you just acknowledged that earlier. what makes this different \n\nUntil we can do more let's do little, that's my way of seeing it. I can avocate bigger changes while making smaller changes myself.\n\n>I didn't say if they were right or wrong and you seem to think I'm implying things are good or bad, if anything I'm asking if things maybe aren't as good or bad as some potray or black and white as you say later\n\nOkay I get it. The thing is you were defending a girl we were calling out for doing something wrong, and backing it up with the fact that a lot of people consider what we're doing wrong. It's not an argument, anyone can consider anything wrong and I already said why I believe what she is doing is immoral. I know a lot of companies do the same, but that doesn't make it any less wrong. Like I wrote before, she is no different than Sh*en CEO, she's doing the same thing he is. We didn't get any arguments why what we are doing would be wrong, you only provided arguments that no matter what we do our lives will never be 100% ethical, and that is something I agree with wholeheartedly and don't plan on arguing. I guess my problem is I don't see why you're defending her.

I don't see your point here ?\n\n>I questioned if they thought buying older slave labor clothes is lowering demand for slave labor in the present and how.\n\nI don't see your point here either. First of all most vintage clothes were not made by slave labour, but even if they were it wouldn't matter as you are not buying from the company who made these clothes, therefore you are not creating a demand. They wouldn't produce slave labour clothing if people didn't buy them. I don't see why you keep mentioning the way vintage clothing was made? Of course it's lowering the demand, you are not buying from those companies.\n\n>I refered to sustainability as marketing where brands claim sustainability to market to customers even if not sustainable. And pushing the duty onto consumers for example the recycling system.\n\nHere I completely agree, the problem is way bigger, companies need to be forced to take responsibilities, I am absolutely not advocating leaving the choice to consumers. Sometimes though I feel like people use arguments like that to justify their bad choices and that does annoy me.\n\n>How many clothes at thrift stores get salvaged, what percent, in most cases the rest goes where\u00bf exactly where you said other countries.\n\n\"Around 85% of all textiles thrown away in the US \u2013 roughly 13 million tonnes in 2017 \u2013 are either dumped into landfill or burned.\"\n\n>The percentage of salvagable clothes may even get smaller if quality continues to fall whether due to ff or other.\n\nYes.\n\n>So again I asked what effect is this \"alternative\" really having on its own compared to the problem at large. Especially considering possible harm it alone may cause or things it may promote whether indirectly or not (trends, styles, etc). This is why asked asked what else they thought could be done in addition O.o\n\nI am doing what I can \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f the effect is obvoiusly not as big as I would like but it is something. There are other things we can do, vote for example.\n\n>An issue you're seeming to have trouble address is again some of the clothes that are being thrifted were made the same way and caused the same harm to ppl who are alive today.\n\nI have trouble addressing it because I don't see your point. That harm has already been caused, if we don't use these clothes it's been for nothing. The more we use one piece of clothing the less harm has been propotionaly caused to clothe us. If 2,700 liters of water are used to make a t-shirt, and said t-shirt is worn 5 times and thrown away then that's 540 litres of water sacrificed for one time someone wore a t-shirt. If said t-shirt is worn 270 times before being thrown away then that's 10 litres of water sacrificed for one time someone wore a t-shirt. I don't see how you think buying vintage clothing directly causes harm to anyone. Through trends, styles is a different thing and you have a point here, but said harm is incomparable to harm caused by buying fast fashion first hand.\n\n>For example a popular thing is vintage windbreakers, alot of those brands are still around and using the same explotation today. Ppl may see that and be encouraged to buy current windbreakers from them or ff knockoffs etc. Then like I said 20 years from now its \"vintage explotation\" again.\n\nYeah I see this. Still there's no right here. I could make something myself, someone will see it and buy a similar piece from a fast fashion company. That's a no ethical consumption under capitalism thing, there is literally no spotless perfect choice here, but some are still WAY better than others.\n\n>I already explained the exclusivity thing of Vintage and compared it to ppl wanting expensive \"hard to get things\". That was in response to them saying vintage pieces are one of a kind worth more etc.\n\nThe \"exclusivity\" of vintage is not fake. The \"exclusivity\" of \"exclusive\" brands is fake. Companies burn things that haven't sold to keep their items \"exclusive\". Some things are however just genuinely rare and as a result they're worth more.\n\n>I'm not questioning if all this is doing anything I was asking how much effect they thought it really had in comparison to the issue at large not what the idea of it is.\n\nAgree here, still if everyone did what they can we wouldn't have a lot of issues. Just do your part in the short run, and fight bigger in the long run.\n\n>Because the road to hell is paved with good intentions as they say :)\n\nAgain you seem to suggest that someone is doing something wrong? Just say directly who and what it is they're doing wrong.

In the short run you are buying a piece of clothing that didn't take someone's water they need to live in order to be made for you.\n\nClothing in thrift stores has already been made and has already harmed the environment and any human it was supposed to cause harm. Now it can either be bought instead of a brand new item (by buying which you are supporting companies causing the harm) and worn and used as they should be, or they could be shipped of to developing countries to destroy the local economy before ending up in toxic landfills. If you do not see which is better I think the problem is you don't want to.\n\n>As is this really just makes individuals feel better about their purchases which is ok but alone it isn't having any affect (yet) make no mistake.

We're not their market anyway, its not directly supporting them but still indirectly so.

Sometimes a close up for the fist pic is cool, as long as it's intentional.\n\n\nThis is just my opinion, but maybe limit the hanger pics to items like the American Eagle longsleeve blouse (that photo is very good btw, I like the background). This is the kind of item where you can see the shape best on a hanger, while for some others a flat lay would be better, for example the striped longsleeve or the black muscle tee, that kind of thing. Also the star leggins, the buyer has no idea weather they're high rise or low rise, flat lay for pants is always best (or modeled if they're your size).\n\n\nAnt try to take the photos from a straight angle on both flat lays and hanger pics, it will show the shape better!\n\n\nAs for descriptions maybe use more spaces in longer descriptions, and maybe some emojis? like:\n\n*title* \u267b\ufe0f\n\n\n\u2660 trait\n\n\u2660 trait\n\n\u2660 another trait\n\n\n\ud83d\udcd0 *size*\n\n\n\ud83c\udff7\ufe0f *brand*\n\n\nSomething like that just basing on your description of the burgundy velvet dress, formating the description in a cool way makes it more readable for the buyer.
