Babies are really good at learning languages, it's one of their few jobs in life for years. But it does take them a long time to speak at a level we, as older language learners, want to speak at. I, personally, don't want to learn for a year and only be able to say words along the lines of more or mama. But older language learners have the advantage of having already done that, and our brains being much more developed, and so we can use textbooks to learn the rules and apply them much more quickly then we would be able to pick them up through hours and weeks of listening. Textbooks alone aren't always great either - it depends a bit on your goals I guess, but for me speaking is my biggest goal, and I think it's much more helpful to know that something sounds right just because, as opposed to having to go through a list of rules for that particular situation. And listening is so helpful for getting an idea of how the language sounds, which will help your accent to improve over time, though I'm not necessarily a fan of not speaking for a certain period of time.

For me, I've thought of it as I am too focused on the next sentence to remember the last one, even if I understood almost every word in the moment. Sounds like this is pretty similar to what you're experiencing. My approach right now is trying to really work on listening. I don't have a concrete answer for what could help you, maybe just giving yourself time at the end of each sentence to think, or if you're really trying to understand everything try to be more loose about it.", "created_utc": "1651184970.0", "edited": "False", "id": "i6lc7ap", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_ue6lo1", "parent_id": "t3_ue6lo1", "score": "3", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "just_needausername", "body": "\u00a1Muchas muchas gracias para todo tu ayuda!

I have been receiving a lot of support and help from Redditors, so I decided to help other people in their struggles. Unfortunately <**the>** Polish version of this subreddit was dead, the last post was from a few months ago. Thankfully things ~~has~~ **have** changed now\\*\\*,\\*\\* and two people started to post a few days ago and I started to correct their texts. You know what is terrifying**?** I am an adult native Pole, who ~~all time~~ **always** has lived in Poland\\*\\*,\\*\\* and I'm struggling to correct really basic sentences. I literally have to use a dictionary and even then I'm not one hundred per cent sure if everything is correct. Polish grammar is really messed up. In English you have just two versions of **<a>** noun, one singular and one plural form\\*\\*,\\*\\* but in Polish one noun has seven different forms in a singular version and **another** seven in a plural. For example\\*\\*,\\*\\* **<a>** noun\\*\\*,\\*\\* a table\\*\\*,\\*\\* and three examples of sentences which use this word. \"This is a table\", \"Your keys are on the table\", \"The cat is hiding under the table\". In Polish **every** table from this sentences looks different~~ly~~, and it's not just nouns that have many different forms. Writing is even worse, because there are some letters that have the same spelling and you have to know which one is correct in a specific word. To be fair\\*\\*,\\*\\* **when the** average Pole ~~when~~ talks\\*\\*,\\*\\* ~~makes~~ **they make** lots of grammatical mistakes and they **don't** even ~~doesn't~~ know about that. I know, the grass is always greener on the other side; at least Polish language has just three tenses. I think finding out about fun facts from other cultures are interesting, so I hope that you'll like this post.  \n\n\nI totally get what you're saying here. I've been trying to correct a post in my native language (English) every day that I make a post in my target language (Spanish). I always worry that I'm making a grammatical mistake in my corrections, since I just base it off of what sounds right, and to be honest I know more actual grammatical rules in my TL than my native language.
