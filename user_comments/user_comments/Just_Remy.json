Anyone can change their pronouns whenever they like, there are no requirements for it. You can just say \"hey, can you use they/them pronouns for me\" literally this second.\n\nChanging your sex legally varies from country to country. For some, it's a simple change of ID, others require psychological evaluations to have your sex legally changed. Medically, I think most countries require a certain amount of therapy (somewhere in the ballpark of 1 year and up, again varying from country to country) before you can have surgeries\n\n>He didn't undergo any surgery or treatment, he simply told people his pronous were he/him and that his name was Viktor.\n\nViktor came out to his family and got a new haircut and a bit of a change in clothing. That's what social transitioning usually looks like and is in most cases the first step to transitioning. Elliot Page, the actor who plays Viktor, is trans as well and has already had top surgery (double mastectomy). It's entirely possible for them to include some story beats about Viktor's medical transition in later seasons.\n\n(Also, as a small aside, this is what people mean when they talk about children transitioning: Social transition. A haircut, new clothes, a new name and a different set of pronouns. Things that are completely reversible. No child is getting invasive surgeries)\n\n>So is it common for people to do this, or do most people also also undergo surgery/reassignment treatment? \n\nThe most typical path of transitioning is like this:\n\n1. Social Transition (name, pronouns, appearance)\n2. HRT (taking Testosterone/Estrogen to induce a \"second puberty\")\n3. Top surgery (for trans men and transmasculine people); possibly facial feminization surgery(s) (for trans women and transfeminine people)\n4. Bottom surgery (construction/reconstruction of genitals)\n5. legal name/sex change somewhere along the line\n\nDepending on a trans individual's needs, some of these steps might be skipped/never taken. This, again, depends on where you live, e.g. I've had to go on hormones before I could get access to top surgery\n\n> do they do this because they don't see the need to do any of this, or are there other reasons for it?\n\nDepends on the person. Some, as you say, just don't feel the need to transition medically (that might be because they don't have any or only very little body dysphoria). But a lot of people, especially in the US, would love to medically transition but simply don't have the money to afford the surgeries.\n\n>how does changing pronouns work? Do you just tell people about it?\n\nYes. There is no legal record of pronouns. Your pronouns are whatever you tell people they are. You can even go by a different name before you've had your name legally changed; you just cannot use your new name to e.g. sign a contract if that's not yet your legal name. You can think of it kind of like a nickname.

One of the first movies I watched in English was Pirates 2 and there's this one scene where Elizabeth and two of the pirates are about to fight each other - only one has a sword. Then they're attacked by Davy Jones's crew and decide to team up (well, sort of). They share the sword, yelling for it whenever they need it. Having characters yell out \"Sword!\", then seeing the sword get tossed to that person makes it very obvious what that word means. \nOn the other hand, if they'd just been talking about swordsmanship, I guarantee you, I would not have learned that word back then (mind you, I was in year 6 and had only started proper English lessons in year 5 so my English was _very_ basic).\n\nI kept rewatching things that were already familiar for a while and eventually dared venturing into unknown territory - I'd recommend going with something simple, slice-of-life next (maybe something like How I Met Your Mother) and a couple of years down the line, I was able to watch even complicated shows like Criminal Minds or The Good Doctor without having too hard of a time (honestly, at that point the hardest part was getting used to how quickly Spencer Reid speaks when he's spitting out some academic information or complex idea).\n\nSo as a TL;DR: \nStep 1.

For one thing, having all 4 villains in your campaign makes things complicated (duh), both for you and the players. Putting together all of the NPCs from the module and remix your players could encounter, you have about 200 people who could potentially make an appearance. They won't, obviously, but it is still difficult to keep track of all the NPCs they'll be encountering (so far, my party has encountered/learned about 57 NPCs).\n\nI will say, as a first time DM, I was slightly overwhelmed by the complexity of the remix until I found a [tool to keep track of NPCs](https://www.reddit.com/r/WaterdeepDragonHeist/comments/tzwugp/dm_resource_a_handy_bookkeeping_tool_for_your/) (and more). I also gave another version of this tool to my players so they would have some way to remember who's who and how things are connected.\n\nI've been using [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) for all my DMing needs and find it fairly simple to keep track of the campaign, all things considered. Yesterday, I finally finished a complete list of NPCs for the Players to track everything they know; more about it in [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/WaterdeepDragonHeist/comments/vhec60/npc_tracking_resource_player_version/). And since you haven't started your campaign yet, you might benefit from this basic [planning structure](https://hollow-caribou-195.notion.site/Dragon-Heist-Planning-Template-592e4cc6421c404eb755b2619630776b) I created for a friend the other day (though that is still a work in progress). Currently includes: Databases for locations and NPCs (just structure and examples), a session prep template, a PC overview and player resources (session recaps, the finished Dragon Heist NPC tracking tool, items, handouts). The basic structure is a simplified version of what I use to run the remix (I conjured this up in less than two hours, apart from the NPC tool) but it gets you started. I'll likely have more to share soon since I'm working on cleaning up and streamlining my notion at the moment anyways. If you feel like using this tool, you and at least one of the players will need a notion account in order to edit things.\n\nAs for the other thing I wanted to mention, though I might be stating the obvious here: The remix isn't everyone's cup of tea.

The private school was technically a catholic school but by the time I started attending, they had already done away with most of the religious influence (apart from making students attend church before every major holiday). The crucifix was present in every single classroom I've been in in Bavaria. I did also attend a school outside of Bavaria for a short while; there wasn't a single crucifix there. Friends who grew up outside of Bavaria have also confirmed that crucifixes in classrooms simply aren't a thing in their states.\n\n>I was taught the American Revolution alongside revolutions in France, Haiti, and the Spanish Wars of Independence\n\nDamn, that sounds awesome!

Our curriculums do vary from state to state (and school type to school type); I remember trying to explain maths to a friend from Hamburg but we were having trouble even communicating about maths because we'd been taught different terms. But slavery is a pretty major thing to disagree on.

You can get the same kind of degree with the same grades one will still be considered better than the other. There's no official ranking of states or anything but we have essentially agreed that school in Bavaria is pretty tough and Berlin is fairly easy. One of my German teacher even mentioned that, apparently, you're only allowed to teach in Bavaria if you've also studied there because the standards vary so wildly.\n\n>Tell me a little bit about Bavaria and how it's different from the rest of Germany?\n\nHow isn't it different from the rest of Germany, lol. I've always likened it more to Austria than other German states. Stereotypes like wearing lederhosen and dirndl only apply to Bavaria (and even here, we don't wear them on a regular basis), even certain foods aren't really a thing outside of Bavaria (specifically Wei\u00dfwurst, Leberk\u00e4ssemmel and Obazda come to mind). I've even had trouble understanding other Bavarians cause they were speaking proper Bavarian dialect whereas I only have a bit of an accent - I did grow up hearing my grandparents speak our local dialect but a trip to the east of Bavaria and I hardly understood a thing. The Bavarian dialect is a lot closer to the Austrian accent than it is to the way they speak in Berlin, or even Frankfurt (closer to Bavaria). \n\nBavaria is also quite conservative. Not in the Nazi kind of way (though they're frighteningly common in Saxony) but more in the \"we love our traditions and we don't want anything to change\" kind of way. Unsurprisingly, Bavaria is also a lot more religious than the rest of Germany, with Christianity (particularly Catholicism) being by far the most prevalent one.\n\nAlso reminded me of [these maps](https://vividmaps.com/tearing-germany-apart/).

I hardly ever describe anything visually when writing; instead I focus more on the character's thoughts and feelings. That does help a lot with getting into character and makes improvising a lot easier, but improvising other stuff? Yikes.

Took them all the way across town and no one bat an eye because I didn't visualize them getting all the stuff.

Tbh, I've never really considered that my languages could be a form of stimming until now; I only ever thought of learning languages/linguistics as a special interest. But I guess they could be.\n\nPersonally, I find English to be very pleasant, soothing even. Maybe that's just cause it was the first language I learnt, the one that got me into learning languages in the first place. I do enjoy my other languages as well, though they don't quite have the same effect on me. They're stimulating in a different way, more... exciting, energising? In part, that's probably because I don't speak the other languages as well so there's still more to learn, but simply the sound of the language also has an effect on me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs far as specific language recommendations go:\n\nI agree with most of the languages others have suggested, however I'm not entirely sure which kind of \"phlegmy throat noises\" you're referring to. First thing that comes to mind for French is the /\u0281/, not dissimilar to the German /x/ (which to me just always sounds like a spitting cat). If that's the sort of sound you dislike, both Spanish and Arabic have similar sounds.\n\nOut of the languages that have been suggested, Italian would be the easiest for you to learn because English borrowed a lot of words from French, which is closely related to Italian. You'd therefore be able to infer the meaning of many words and have an easier time learning them. Same goes for Spanish.\n\nI don't know an awful lot about the remaining languages, but some things to point out:\n\n\\- Russian has 6 cases. Technically, English also has cases (which is why there are sets of pronouns, like he/him/his), but these cases don't have much of an effect, beyond pronouns. Russian cases affect the overall grammar of a sentence. Learning Russian would also mean you'd have to learn the Cyrillic Alphabet\n\n\\- Mandarin has 4 tones which can influence the meaning of a word. English doesn't have this feature, as it's a stress accent language (compare: to be con**tent** vs. the **con**tent of a box). You'd also have to learn 2,000-8,000 Chinese characters, depending on your goals. The grammar itself is rather simple; Mandarin doesn't use conjugations but there are particles to denote the grammatical function of words. Used to be only written from top to bottom, right to left but these days some people also write in the \"standard\" Western style (horizontally, left to right).\n\n\\- Arabic uses a script which, as far as I know, is quite a bit more complicated than simply having to learn another alphabet. The grammar is also quite complex, though I'm not familiar with specific features. It's written horizontally, from right to left\n\n\\- Spanish and Italian are quite similar; the most notable difference being grammatical gender. Both have masculine and feminine. A noun's grammatical gender affects not only the article that goes along with it but also associated adjectives (e.g. un chico guapo vs. una chica guapa). Conjugation is also much more complex than in English, though I don't know enough about the other languages to compare which one is the most/least complex. Both are also stress accent languages, like English", "created_utc": "1649842021.0", "edited": "False", "id": "i4jm2e5", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_u2fp4z", "parent_id": "t3_u2fp4z", "score": "2", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "Just_Remy", "body": "There are a couple of words endings that are commonly associated with certain genders.

Language isn't something you learn and then consciously apply (unless maybe you're writing a speech or something). Language should be acquired, so you can use it without even thinking about it. Of course, it's helpful to have a basic knowledge of grammar; it helps accelerate the process if you can, for example, recognize adjectives and verbs and know what they mean/do. But it's by no means necessary. After all, you learnt to speak English before you ever took a single grammar course, didn't you?\n\n  \nTo this day, I can't tell you the rules for when to apply will future vs going to future but at this point, I've been immersing in English content for over a decade; I can tell which tense feels right without having to know the rules for it.

Teachers would ask you to produce the language right away before you've had any chance of acquiring it and I used to struggle a lot with the various past tenses when I was trying to apply the rules because I kept overthinking it.\n\nSome of the knowledge I gained from English classes definitely helped me progress, but I wouldn't recommend using the classroom approach as their main way of learning a language to anyone, unless they had a very short amount of time to learn a language, in which case I'd focus on speaking rather than grammar.  \nI very much doubt that classroom lessons alone can get someone higher than a B2 level.

Instead of news (which still has very little visual context cause it's just a talking head for the most part), try a TV show or film, ideally aimed at kids (by that I don't mean Bob the Builder or something but something similar to Pixar movies).

Hearing people yell \"sword\" over and over again and seeing the action that follows (someone tossing the sword to someone else) makes it basically impossible not to learn that word.

Be aware of other needs, e.g. if you feel like he might be stressed out because of the noise, you could ask him if he would like to talk somewhere more quiet.\n\n3. Otherwise treat him like everyone else\n\nAnd technically, 4. Don't use slurs etc. but from what you've written so far, I don't think I need to tell you that. So I'm just adding it for the sake of completeness.", "created_utc": "1649369096.0", "edited": "False", "id": "i3tj4wr", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_txoxor", "parent_id": "t1_i3r5687", "score": "2", "subreddit": "neurodiversity", "subreddit_id": "t5_2tzqe"}, {"author": "Just_Remy", "body": "The tongue is touching the alveolar ridge (behind front teeth).
