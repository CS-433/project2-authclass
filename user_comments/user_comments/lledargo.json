If you reread the portion of my comment you were responding to I am saying speaking is **not necessary** and that this is evidenced by children learning to recognize and understand their **first** words before they do any speaking. I never said, nor does Krashen for that matter, that children fully learn the language before speaking. \n\n> Children will start to form their first, malformed sentences before they understand everything.\n\nAs I mention above, the argument I am making is not the children reach full comprehension before speaking. The point I was making is that writing and comprehension are different skills. Practicing one does not make you more proficient at the other. e.g. You may be able to comprehend thousands of Chinese characters, but that does not help you write them. Conversely, you may be able to draw a Chinese character without understanding what it means and in such a case **Drawing the character will not build your comprehension of it.**\n\n>This does not at all follow from what is in that video where he makes no such nuance and his wording heavily implies that practicing speaking is useless for all forms of improving in language.\n>\n>If his claim is that speaking does not improve listening, but improves speaking, it would be a far weaker one. His claim seems to that speaking does not even improve speaking.\n\nI don't see where he makes the claim that speaking does not help with speaking. I don't think he really addresses speech beyond the point of, \"Speaking does not improve comprehension\". \n\n> It seems very unlikely that listening to French comprehensible input audio for 2 hours will match up with an actual conversation in French for 2 hours in terms of improvement, even though the latter would only give half the input.\n\nThis argument is very speculative, but if true can easily be explained by acknowledging that comprehensible input media is likely going to be less interesting than an engaging conversation. Less interest and motivation cause the affective filter to engage and input not processed. \n\nTo reiterate, practice comprehending input, improves input comprehension. Practicing output improves output.

Is it from new external input received while investigating the word or phrases uses? Or input from a conversation partner's responses or corrections?\n\nIf it is truly novel and from within as you say, then is it really part of the language? I'll grant you, language evolves overtime, based on the users' understanding and usage. However it seems to me, this kind of creative linguistics is not the same as language acquisition and could again be regarded as a separate skill.\n\nI think this idea does start to break down a little bit here. In my previous comment I point out that comprehension of a language does not seem to contribute to your ability to write the characters or pronounce the words, but language comprehension is certainly a prerequisite to creative linguistics. Which brings us back to the question, is creative linguistics part of the language? \n\nPerhaps we need some level of adoption must occur before a creative, novel phrase or sentence can be considered part of the language? That begs the question, what if someone creates some new linguistic pattern they are not familiar with, but the pattern is already well established in the language?

A person learns to write or speak by writing or speaking, but they learn to comprehend language by comprehending the language. In this video Krashen is discussing language acquisition or comprehension, not output skills.", "created_utc": "1665114016.0", "edited": "1665114259.0", "id": "ird7bjj", "is_submitter": "True", "link_id": "t3_xxen0x", "parent_id": "t1_ircu15f", "score": "9", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "lledargo", "body": ">his hypothesis entails that speaking Spanish to the mirror, to oneself, or even to other people does nothing without backing it up\n\nI believe he does back this up, albeit anecdotally. For starters, he gives his story of Itomi, the young girl he tried to teach English by coercing speech from her. Instead he observed speaking came second to and as a result of her language acquisition through other means.   \nHe draws a parallel from this story to first language acquisition as well. Children are born unable to speak. As they acquire language and gain confidence in their understanding they can begin to speak. Speaking comes as a result of language acquisition, so it follows that speaking is not necessary to acquire language. \n\nHe also explains while speaking will not directly help you acquire language, if your words prompt comprehensible input from your conversation partner you will still end up learning.\n\n\n>I've never understood where Krashen derives these, honestly mad ideas that were never backed up or explained that output practice does not lead to increased linguistic competence. \n\nIt is important to make a distinction between 'language aquisition' and 'linguistic competence'. Output practice may help you improve at speaking or writing, increasing linguistic competence, but by definition anything you output is language you have already acquired so no language acquisition occurs.\nWhere on one hand linguistic competence can include speech and writing, language acquisition is purely about understanding the language. I have not heard Krashen make this point directly but I think he would agree with this assessment.\n\nI think it becomes clearer when you consider the opposite. Language acquisition does not make you better at speaking. Obtaining a high level of understanding in a language will help you formulate better sentences, but you need to practice the muscle movements before you can speak or write well. This stays in line with what we see in first language acquisition. Children learn to understand various words and phrases before they are ever able to speak. Once they do start speaking they struggle with even the words they are most familiar with.\n\n\n> It has been shown with about any skill, neurologically that actively using the skill for something, being forced to use it makes one better at it. This is especially evident with scripts. There is no way anyone can ever learn Chinese characters without writing them by hand. Yes, one can learn to recognize them by only reading them, but everyone who tried to learn Chinese or Japanese knows that the only way to learn the actual shapes of the characters to the point of production is to write them out by hand. There are a thousand Chinese characters I can recognize instantly but if I were to be asked to write them down I couldn't.\n\nYes, exactly. You learn how to speak or write by speaking or writing. You learn to understand language by comprehending input.\n\n\n>I take it we can agree as established fact that moving to a country where the target language is spoken speeds up the language learning process? How does one intend to explain this under the idea that speaking is not practice? \n\nI agree, language immersion is known to accelerate language acquisition. The reasoning Krashen provides for this (In a different video IIRC) is the learner receives much more language input through immersion. With the increase in input, even if most of the input is incomprehensible, the learner is still more likely to receive a lot more comprehensible input than they would receive from simply taking a course on their target language. The additional comprehensible input is what leads to the language acquisition. Speaking as a language acquisition tool is only useful to prompt more comprehensible input.\n\nEven if the idea of speaking not directly contribute to language acquisition is wrong, I believe it still stands to reason that the most powerful tool for language acquisition is comprehensible input. As such a large chunk of a learners time should be spent reading, watching, or listening to media the learner finds interesting and understandable.", "created_utc": "1665112079.0", "edited": "1665112471.0", "id": "ird3nh5", "is_submitter": "True", "link_id": "t3_xxen0x", "parent_id": "t1_irck60j", "score": "7", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "lledargo", "body": "Usually when people question my methods for language learning, I send them the linked video.

In my opinion it is the federal government's responsibility to pick up the tab, which of course puts the cost on the tax payer. It will be a small price to pay to right the wrongs of the past, and a small price compared to the lost potential of our nation if we do not make reparations. Remember this isn't about trying to take the moral high-ground, but trying to repair our society by helping those who have been traditionally stunted by actions of the federal government.\n\nSlavery is a difficult example because it's hard to target the people who have been wronged, harder yet to put monetary value on the lost wages and potential of the affected person's ancestors not receiving fair pay for potentially generations, and again even harder to find a feasible way of trying to right those wrongs. Slavery is nasty business..\n\nDiscrimination can be pretty nasty too. Back in the 1930-60s the Federal housing authority would refuse to underwrite/insure home loans for Blacks. Housing is one of the best tools for building generational wealth, and the Federal government did what they could to make it harder for blacks to buy houses than whites. An example of reparations might look like the federal government creating a home grant program targeted at blacks who have not owned a home in 1 or 2 generations. This would not fix everything but it would be a good start.\n\nAnother example might be a government grant program to help the people who were in the Japanese internment camps in the US during world war two reestablish the businesses they lost or buy new homes.\n\nA less racial, more recent example might give it some prospective. The US air force polluted Iosco county Michigan with [PFAS substances](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Per-_and_polyfluoroalkyl_substances). Shouldn't the federal government help the community clean the pollution and take special care to help the people of the area with the health conditions PFASs are known to cause? maybe a federally funded research hospital in the area and/or federal subsidies to pay to treat damage to liver, thyroids, etc. \n\nWhen it comes to reparations it's in the name \"repair\"-ations.

I am looking to add some other bootable utilities and custom OS iso's with non bootable tools in the future to make a well rounded install/repair tool. That being said, I have only tested using the amd64 version of the install65.iso. I also have only tried this on a Lenovo notebook and a Celeron based SoC board. Both machines have have UEFI, though the laptop had legacy mode enabled. \n\nI have a USB external HDD with grub2 installed, which has a bootable MBR partition. In the bootable partition is my /boot and /boot/iso directory. /boot of course contains my second stage grub files, /boot/iso however contains various iso's I may want to boot to such as my copy of the official amd64 install65.iso. I am not sure if its is the best or most secure solution, but I like keeping the isos in the same partition as grub because it makes mounting them as a loop device slightly easier. I edited /boot/grub/grub.cfg to add:\n\n    menuentry \"OpenBSD 6.5 amd64\" {\n    set isofile=\"/boot/iso/install65.iso\"\n    loopback loop $isofile\n    kopenbsd (loop)/6.5/amd64/bsd.rd\n    }\n\nIt is important to note this *SKIPS* the OpenBSD bootloaders! I have not come across any issues skipping the OpenBSD bootloaders to boot the iso just to run the installer, but like everything else on OpenBSD it was made that way for a reason and you should do your own research to understand the potential consequences. \n\nIf you are looking for some further reading, I pieced together this method of booting the iso from grub using some prior knowledge of booting linux isos from grub as well as:\nhttps://www.openbsd.org/faq/faq4.html#Multibooting\nhttps://www.gnu.org/software/grub/manual/grub/grub.html (section 5.2 and 5.3.3)\nhttps://man.openbsd.org/man8/amd64/boot.8", "created_utc": "1571167623.0", "edited": "1571193521.0", "id": "f3uuks3", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_ckviqs", "parent_id": "t1_f3t5gfa", "score": "2", "subreddit": "openbsd", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qnr6"}, {"author": "lledargo", "body": "Thanks!
