You obviously can't give any absolutes when it comes to language. But the reason why 2 parents aren't usually enough is because parents are busy! If they work full time and they only get to speak to their child in the evening, let's say, then it limits the kids' exposure. And that's assuming parents won't ever speak Spanish at home which would be normal in a bilingual environment (especially if it's both their native language)\n\nThere's a lot more I could say but OP would have to consider that their child might just end up speaking Spanish because it'll be so present everywhere that it'll be the easiest language to speak. That's why creating lots of activities and environment around English would be useful because they would HAVE TO speak/hear it.

I'm not saying anything negative or positive but I think it's important to notice when our opinion on language is only our opinion. And you did acknowledge it.  \n\n\nNow I do agree with you that hearing some people pronouncing things \"wrong\" can be frustrating. I would know, I'm a language teacher and pronunciation is one of the challenges we face when teaching languages. There are students that just get it very quickly, and others that make the same simple mistakes over and over again.  \nWhile I think this can be the teacher's fault (i.e. if they don't focus enough on pronunciation or, in rarer cases, if they don't have themselves a clear/good pronunciation) but I think it's mostly because students aren't always aware of their pronunciation. That's because imo pronunciation takes a lot of drilling and exposure to the language, even more so for people who struggle with it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI also think some people just don't have an ear for it. Or aren't as perfectionist as you (and me) so they don't see it as a priority. It's understandable for those who don't have much experience with language. I am \"lucky\" that I grew up bilingual and I have a wider understand of pronunciation than monolinguals (+ the added benefit of a wider sound repertoire). But it's not the case for everyone.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nJust wanted to point out a couple of things, the following statement isn't true : \" the Spanish \"U,\" which is the same sound as the English \"Oo\". It's not the same sound exactly. In IPA, it wouldn't be transcribed the same way. It's veeery similar, but it's not the same.   \nWhile consonants sounds can be very similar from one language to another, vowel sounds are usually tricky because they are often where the accent lies and thus where pronunciation inaccuracies can occur.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI hope it helps!", "created_utc": "1560337803.0", "edited": "False", "id": "equyd3k", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_bzmpl5", "parent_id": "t3_bzmpl5", "score": "2", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "KevinAbroad", "body": "Thank you so much!", "created_utc": "1560334630.0", "edited": "False", "id": "equs25k", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_bzcrmw", "parent_id": "t3_bzcrmw", "score": "1", "subreddit": "LearnJapanese", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qyls"}, {"author": "KevinAbroad", "body": "Yeah that's true.

I actually posted a video I made on my channel here on the sub and it trended so I think you might find it interesting. I've studied bilingualism research (and I was raised bilingually) and I actually think the One parent One language approach isn't the best and many linguists have tried to demonstrate why it's not ideal. Basically people think children will mix up the language if the parents speak the two languages. This has never been proven as no bilinguals ever mix up their languages once they reach linguistic maturity (but when they're 3 or 4 they might mix it up a bit - I used to). Anyway, I discuss these points in the video and I hope you find it interesting!\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sr7E7gCj5FQ\n\nPS: I was raised bilingually in French and Portuguese", "created_utc": "1526390592.0", "edited": "False", "id": "dz0i1d4", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_8jkev0", "parent_id": "t3_8jkev0", "score": "1", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "KevinAbroad", "body": "Oh yes!

I've made a video about this topic because I did some research in bilingualism. \nShort answer is: no, there is not definition of bilingualism. Anyone, even linguists specialised in bilingualism research, has a different definition of bilingualism. Many people think that a bilingual is someone that speaks 2 languages like a native speaker (so \"perfect fluency\"). This definition is highly problematic because if use that definition, virtually anyone that speaks more than one language wouldn't fit that category. It's a bit long to explain but basically it's impossible to know 2 languages like a monolingual knows its only language. It requires the exact amount of exposure in the two languages. There are also issues around \"which native speakers do you use as a refenrence\" because 2 native speakers of the same language don't have the same fluency.\n\nAnother definition which reflects the reality of bilingualism (in my opinion) is to consider someone bilingual when they use 2 or more languages in their daily life or regularly. Fluency doesn't really matter and you can be bilingual even if you can't write or read in that language properly.\n\nNo definition is right or wrong. People that say otherwise aren't linguists. Even linguists always have to decide which definition of bilingualism they use when they do their research, simply because it's a problematic concept. They sort of have to arbitrarily decide.\n\nHope that helps and check out the video as it might enlighten you a bit more :).\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4c2zLtAGv0&t=163s", "created_utc": "1525716316.0", "edited": "False", "id": "dyli7x7", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_8hoyzz", "parent_id": "t3_8hoyzz", "score": "6", "subreddit": "languages", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qrrf"}, {"author": "KevinAbroad", "body": "Just go tbh.
