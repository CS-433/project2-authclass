For christians at least, he doesn't act like a distant judge, but like a loving father who wants the best for his children.\n\nI believe strongly that watching porn is a sin, because of this verse:\n\nYou have heard that it was said, \u2018You shall not commit adultery.\u2019 But I say to you that everyone who looks at a woman with lustful intent has already committed adultery with her in his heart. (Matthew 5:27)\n\nGod cares about what goes on inside of us, not just our outward action. In addition, porn is a massive gateway to lots of bad things. If you look at the kind of things that are on the front pages of those websites, there is a whole lot of other sin being promoted, and the rabbit hole just goes deeper as you get more and more into it.\n\nThis is the kind of thing that can really mess with you, so i would recommend doing whatever you need to do to keep away from porn. I've left behind things that were once important to me, because they were leading me the wrong way. Granted, it took years of convincing from God to get me to finally do it, but I've seen tangible results from leaving it behind. And ultimately, all truly good things in our lives come from abiding in Jesus, so don't try to do it all on your own (john 15:4)\n\nOne last thing, hopefully comforting to you: your conviction here is a good thing. Someone i know once said that the surest sign of being a christian is struggling with sin. From Galatians 5:16-17:\n\nSo I say, walk by the Spirit, and you will not gratify the desires of the flesh. For the flesh desires what is contrary to the Spirit, and the Spirit what is contrary to the flesh. They are in conflict with each other, so that you are not to do whatever you want. \n\nIf you want to message me about anything, Im always free to talk.

Id also say it seems to go against the biblical idea of how significant sex is, and how spiritual it is, but that's out of the depth of this post\n\nAs for why God doesn't punish everyone who does it... I guess the best way to adress this would be to think about all the other ways you (and I) have sinned, and what would happen if we were individually punished/prevented from doing those things. Punch someone? No more fists. Scream at someone? No more tongue. It just doesn't make sense. Yes, God punished sin in the bible, but he also chose not to sometimes.\n\nGod has the authority to judge sin, but most of the time he defers that until we die and all face the final judgement.

A good place to start is to draw up a reference chart for yourself of what prounoun to use for all three types, for every combonation (ie, IO: me te le[se] nos os les; DO: me te lo/la nos os los/las; etc.). Sometimes you just need to see all the possibilities together so you can compare them.\n\nI also tend to rework my understanding of verbs a bit so that it's easier to remember if i should use direct or indirect. For example, if you think of gustar as meaning \"to be pleasing\", then it makes more sense to use IO pronouns. \"Le gusta\" = \"[to him] it is pleasing\". Same with encantar: \"me encantaron\" = \"[to me] they were enchanting\".
