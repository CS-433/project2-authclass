Mirena is what my gyno recommends. I hope that this insight helps a little bit?\n\nAlso, this sub seems really friendly & I think I\u2019ll be sticking around :\u2019)) I just started questioning and I\u2019m a bit nervous aha", "created_utc": "1631930444.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hda74g8", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_pq4h6r", "parent_id": "t1_hd8wyeg", "score": "2", "subreddit": "NonBinary", "subreddit_id": "t5_2vcez"}, {"author": "mochibunne", "body": "The sales are pretty good, too.
