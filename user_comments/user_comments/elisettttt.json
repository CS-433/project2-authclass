They give you winged light, which levels up your cape and gives you more flaps so you can fly around better. Then there are the spirits. Spirits that glow blue are regular spirits which will require you to go to the temple at the end of the realm in order to see them in your constellation at home. Spirits from past seasons glow purple. Their cosmetics are only available when they return as a travelling spirit. A travelling spirit comes every two weeks. They will pop up in the home space where you can buy their cosmetics from them. This requires candles which you can get by lighting up red candles or burning dark plants. It might also require hearts, there are multiple ways to obtain them. By friending someone and lighting them in your friend constellation (need 60 pieces of light to get one heart so might be a bit slow at first), by exchanging hearts (you can send someone a heart which costs 3 candles), and a few other ways but these are the main ways to obtain hearts.\n\nA spirit that glows orange is either part of a daily quest or is the current travelling spirit. There's more but I don't want to overwhelm you with information, I think this sums the basics up pretty well. If you want we can add each other on sky and I can show you around!

They can try the \"try for free 30 days\" or something, which is a pretty good amount of time to get a feel for the game and see most places. \n\nThat's a fair point, but I still think ults should come back. As an IAP or not I don't really care. If for free they could simply make it an uglier reskin (because the sky community will be on fire if the same ults came back for free) and charge an insane amount of AC or hearts for every season ults so they're hard to get. You'd really need to work for them, even more so then the people in the season had to work for them. But at least it won't be impossible. \n\nWithout the AP, the items on the left of a spirit tree remain locked and you can only get those items once they come back as TS (gotta pay candles). With AP, you don't just unlock the item in the middle, but you get the one on the left as well for no additional cost of candles.

Yeah of course its about the money, but plenty of people would still get the pass even if ultimates became available later on in a similar way as a TS or whatever.

I've heard vets who played for years quit sky because they feel it's all slowly becoming a money grab. Now, I've only started playing during the season of abyss so I'm still quite new here, but that does make me wonder if this game used to be cheaper? Were IAPs less expensive? Did free items require less candles? I just hope tgc gets their shit together and doesn't get blinded by money. It'd be terrible if you can't finish a season's constellation tree even though you do dailies every day for example. Now already the window isn't that big, and if you miss a few days you won't be able to get all the items. For a game which is supposed to be relaxing, this doesn't seem very relaxing to me. Wouldn't be the first time a game got ruined because the company got too fixated on making money off of it, I just really hope sky won't meet the same fate. I'd rather just pay for sky up front and have the rest of the IAPs be significantly cheaper than playing a free game where everything is super expensive. \n\nPeople actually do that?! Woah, that's crazy. I did get the AP for last season (sadly missed the penguin hair though..), but I couldn't even imagine spending even more money just to get my hands on all the cosmetics in one go.
