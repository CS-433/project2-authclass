I know, it has much functionality, and you can customize it endlessly, BUT only if you spend the time. For many things, you also need a PC additionally that could also not be taken for granted. 92% of the Internet users use a smartphone ([source](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1289755/internet-access-by-device-worldwide/)). Having a desktop (66.8%) cannot be expected as a standard anymore. I know Anki has a mobile app (I refer hereby to the iOS one)\u2014but most of the setup and customization needs to be done on a PC. And then, you also face many options, which is overwhelming for the majority (Hick's law).\n\nSo, if you are all new to this - Anki isn't exactly easy to use (at least the setup part\u2014the review part is fine). Then, another factor is the experience. UX is not only about usability, but also about making you feel good and also enjoyment\u2014basically your feelings. And Anki feels technical. If you start new, it might even feel boring. \n\nSo, then on the other side we have apps like Duolingo or LingoDeer or Memrise that are easy to use and also make you feel good. There is no cumbersome setup stage. They motivate you to continue. But: they are not suited for the learner who likes to follow their own path and material. Then, there are apps like Quizlet. Easy to set up, easy to use. It can be customized and will serve most languages, besides ones that need more information. For example, Japanese. The way Quizlet works is that you set a definition and an answer, and maybe an additional picture / audio (if you pay). But for Japanese, you may want more fields like the sentence, the reading, and the meaning (plus maybe pitch, stroke order etc.). So, people may feel like solutions like Quizlet are too simple.\nAnd the other thing that exists that allows this type of customization is the overwhelming Anki. \n\nI think there is a gap for a good UX, customizable flashcard app that is usable on a phone only. I feel like if Anki released a mobile client for both platforms that mirrors about most of the functionality of the desktop app (especially the setup part) and also improved the UX by a better onboarding, more joyful wording/UI, the gap would be filled. \nUX is not about prettiness, it is about how you feel as a user and how well you can do your task. I can also imagine a default mode for several use cases (e.g., 1 for language learners, 1 for mathematicians, etc.) with less functionality and an expert mode for a lot of customization to also reduce the feeling of being overwhelmed.\n\nLikewise, I know, that there are people saying like \u201cyeah, Anki is not that hard, there are tons of YouTube tutorials\". Yes, there are, but expecting users to watch videos/researching lengthy tutorials until they can get going, is not exactly user-friendly. Many companies spend tons of money on improving their first time experience, as the first impression determines whether you continue using the app or you just uninstall and go further. How often did you read the manual that comes along with the devices you purchase? We also have to assume a beginner mindset here. Imagine that there is a user without any background knowledge or much technical experience\u2014how do they experience the app? \nI feel like Anki is a good application for tech-savvy people, but for many people, it might just feel like it is too complex.", "created_utc": "1664014881.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ipp9wj6", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_xm8qf6", "parent_id": "t3_xm8qf6", "score": "34", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "colutea", "body": "No, as this will feel less human. Imagine talking to another person: While they talk, you hear some computer voice but not THEIR voice, their intonation, etc. Even if the tech at some point in a few years will be able to mimic their voice, it will still feel weird.\nAnother issue are delays. E.g. in Japanese, you need to wait until the very end of the sentence to get the context, hence, the translation will be also delayed by at least one sentence. When talking, you speak in a flow, you are not interrupted. You use gestures and mimics. Hence, you have to memorize the gestures, etc. and map them to the translation. That will take some brainpower and might make it exhausting. Plus, the other person has to wait until you listened to the translation.\nI think this will result in some interruptions but won't make it feel as natural as a regular conversation. \nI think this helps tourists or people going to doctors/institutions/... in a foreign country but I doubt it will replace language learning since communication is more than just \"understanding what the other person says\".", "created_utc": "1662933460.0", "edited": "False", "id": "io1ovgr", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_xb2li9", "parent_id": "t3_xb2li9", "score": "1", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "colutea", "body": "Ich h\u00e4tte auch Lust :) aktuell bin ich noch mit dem Umzug besch\u00e4ftigt, das sollte aber bald besser werden.

Consulting macht und da Change Management betreiben kann, aber als Berufseinsteiger sollte man da aufpassen.\n\nAber das Feld bietet viel mehr als \"nur Designer, der den visuellen Ablauf designed\". Da es nicht nur visuell ist, sondern auch Business Logic betrifft und das Gesch\u00e4ftsmodell. Um darin weit zu kommen, ist wirtschaftliches Interesse essentiell. \n\nSpezialisieren kann man sich in X Richtungen, entweder Software oder auch Maschinen (Roboter, etc.). Genauso wie ich meinte visuell oder eher strategisch. Und da drunter gibts auch nochmal Nischen (User Research, Design Systeme, Service design, ...)\nDa muss man schauen, was die Uni anbietet. Manchmal gibts HCI auch unter dem Deckmantel Medieninformatik. Und gerne schreiben die Unternehmen als Studiumvoraussetzung auch einfach nur \"Informatik\".\n\nM\u00f6gliche Job-Titel:\n- UX Designer\n- UI Designer\n- UX/UI Desisgner\n- UX Architect\n- Product Designer\n- Service Designer\n- Interaction Designer\n- UX Researcher\n- UX Engineer\n- Information Architect\n- UX Copywriter\n- Content Strategist\n...\n\nBeim Beispiel SAP find ich unter ner schneller Suche alleine 3396 Stellen unter der Kennzeichnung UX bzw. Product Design.\n\nEine Spezialisierung in dem Bereich, die ich anraten w\u00fcrde ist Barrierefreiheit. Das fehlt vielen Unternehmen, da viele nicht wissen, wie das geht. In paar Jahren ist es f\u00fcr die ersten Dienstleistungen (Bankautomaten, E commerce, Banken, ...) gesetzlich verpflichtet und es ist davon auszugehen, dass noch mehr Dienstleistungen nachziehen werden m\u00fcssen.\nhttps://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=1202", "created_utc": "1654968055.0", "edited": "1654969650.0", "id": "ibzsk3w", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_v9wgb6", "parent_id": "t1_ibz4wj0", "score": "4", "subreddit": "informatik", "subreddit_id": "t5_38yld"}, {"author": "colutea", "body": "Du musst halt nur richtig viel schreiben und Lesen auf wissenschaftlichem Niveau, das ist was ganz anderes als Abi.\nSuch mal nach paar Papern auf Google Scholar und dann lies davon paar.

Ich hatte Kommilitonen, die haben zum Teil erst mit 30 angefangen.\n\nDie mathelastigen F\u00e4cher sind m.E. die mit den hohen Durchfallquoten. Das liegt auch bisschen dran, dass deutschlandweit das Abi nicht einheitlich ist.\nIch hab zB in Bayern Abi gemacht und hatte alles n\u00f6tige in Mathe gelernt, Leute aus Berlin hatten da mehr Schwierigkeiten. Aber die (guten) Unis bieten aus dem Grund i.d.R. Vorkurse an.\nDie sollte man auch besuchen, dann hat mans leichter. Wenn du in der Schule keine Schwierigkeiten mit Mathe hattest und ein gutes Grundverst\u00e4ndnis da ist, dann sollte das machbar sein, solang du den Uni-Stoff gut lernst und alle \u00dcbungen machst. Ich hab mir zB mehrere B\u00fccher mit extra \u00dcbungen auch aus der Bibliothek ausgeliehen. Wenn du L\u00fccken im Abi-Mathe hast oder in einem Bundesland mit \"leichtem\" Mathe-Abi Abi gemacht hast oder nur nen Grundkurs hattest, solltest du das nachholen.\n\nOb das an ner Nicht-Elite-Uni wirklich leichter ist/weniger Stoff oder nur von Leuten so erz\u00e4hlt wird, um andere Unis niederzumachen, kann ich nicht sagen. Es ist anzunehmen, dass wenn du mit Mathe Probleme hast, hast du die \u00fcberall. \nMeistens hat man ja sowieso drei Versuche, wenn man sich wirklich ins Zeug h\u00e4ngt, dann schafft man das auch, damit auszukommen.\n\nDas Problem ist so bisschen, wenn dir f\u00fcr den Master die Grundlagen fehlen, dann hast dus schwieriger. \nOb es besser ist, zu wechseln kann ich nicht sagen, da hat jeder ne andere Meinung.\nIch war ganz froh durchgehend an der gleichen Uni gewesen zu sein, weil ich kannte im Master einige Profs vom Studienbeginn schon, wusste was so deren Lieblingsthemen sind und kannte die Forschungsbereiche auch ziemlich gut. Probleme mit fehlenden Grundlagen hatte ich so auch nicht. \n\nEin Wechsel ist dann gut, wenn man sich in nem Forschungsbereich spezialisieren will, den die Uni entweder nicht anbietet oder nicht so viel Kompetenz darin hat oder sich ein Lehrstuhl aufl\u00f6st, etc.\n\nIch hab mir damals auch gedacht, oh nein, \u00fcber Dreiviertel sind durch Mathe gefallen, oh nein, oh nein. Am besten nicht verr\u00fcckt machen, flei\u00dfig lernen. \nUnd Fragen stellen, es gibt meist Tutoren, Sprechstunden, etc. Was auch hilft, ist sich Studenten paar Semester \u00fcber dir zu schnappen und Tipps geben lassen. Was wurde damals abgefragt, wie ist der Dozent drauf, etc. Am besten auch Kommilitonen suchen, die auch motiviert sind und zusammen lernen.\n\nIch w\u00fcrd sagen, probiers an deiner Wunsch-Uni und vorbereite dich gut, lerne mit und dann klappt das. Das Leben versaut man sich nur, wenn man sich selbst im Weg steht und nicht an sich glaubt.\n\nNoch ein kleiner Tipp, wenn du noch nicht programmieren kannst, solltest du das jetzt nachholen.

Die Leute gibts \u00fcberall.\n\nWie einer meiner Dozenten mal meinte, es gibt Leute, die will man auch sp\u00e4ter nicht betreuen, weil die sich keine M\u00fche geben und dann die Forschungsergebnisse (im Master) dann unbrauchbar sind. Und das ist f\u00fcr die nur Aufwand. Die von sehr guten Studenten kannst du weiter nutzen f\u00fcr deine Forschung. Wenn du folglich ne hohe Reputation als Uni hast, willst du auch die Nachwuchs-Wissenschaftler nachhaltig exzellent ausbilden, sonst bleibt die Qualit\u00e4t nicht. Folglich muss irgendwie gefiltert werden.\n\nAber ganz ehrlich, wenn man konsistent lernt und sich M\u00fche gibt, dann kommt man durch alles auch mit sehr guten Noten durch. Also Vorlesungen und Seminare vor- und nachbereiten, das Semester \u00fcber lernen und auch mal \u00fcber den Tellerrand hinaus Publikationen lesen.\n\nWenn du dir folglich M\u00fche gibst und bei den Profs nen guten Ruf hast, betreuen die dich auch besser in der Abschlussarbeit und dein Abschluss wird folglich super. Zu mir meinten Dozenten auch mal, bei einigen merken sie, dass die sich null f\u00fcr deren Forschung interessieren und am besten mit wenig Aufwand ne gute Note wollen. Bei den Leuten, die ernsthaft interessiert sind, da geben sie mehr Feedback, weil sich die Ergebnisse verwerten lassen und wenns gut l\u00e4uft, hat man am Ende vom Studium so nicht nur nen Master, sondern ist auch Co-Autor (was definitiv auch gut in der Praxis ankommt).\n\nEs muss einem klar sein, dass ein Studium, insb. der Master forschungsorientiert ist. Und wenn man an ner Uni ist, wo einen die Forschungsthemen nicht interessieren, dann kommt man nicht weit (da Dozenten sehr gerne eigene Forschung st\u00e4rker gewichten). Wenn man sich f\u00fcr die Themen interessiert und bereit ist, da tief einzutauchen, dann spiegeln das die Noten wieder.\n\n------\n\nUnd wenn man sich nicht f\u00fcr die Wissenschaft  interessiert, dann sollte man erw\u00e4gen ne Ausbildung zu machen oder mit ausreichender Erfahrung es auch zu lassen, weil sonst hat man keine Freude am Studium.\nDie meisten, die abgebrochen haben, waren verwundert, dass es in der Uni so \"theoretisch\" ist und dass es da viel um Wissenschaft geht.\n\nF\u00fcr mich waren die Master-Module die spannensten im gesamten Studium und mir fielen die leichter, als die im Bachelor, weil es mich so sehr interessiert hat. Andere fanden das total \u00f6de und schwer und haben nur gejammert (\"an Uni X w\u00e4rs viel leichter\"), das sind aber auch die Leute, die nur ein Blatt Papier wollen und am besten haufenweise Geld, ohne aber irgendwas daf\u00fcr zu machen.\n\nDeswegen, wenn du tief eintauchen willst und wissenschaftlich interessiert bist und nicht Party \u00fcber alles stellst, dann schaffst du auch ne super Note an ner \"schweren\" Uni. \n\n----\n\nThat said, in meinem Fall haben sich die Unternehmen vor allem f\u00fcr meine Erfahrung als Werkstudent interessiert (in meinem Fall 5 Jahre, hab durchgehend gearbeitet) und nach den Uni-Noten wurd ich nur gefragt, nachdem der Prozess fertig war, 1 Tag bevor ich den Vertrag bekommen hab. Der ganze Prozess ging nur ums fachliche. Vielleicht ist das bei Leuten ohne Erfahrung anders.\nIrgendwelche Head-Hunter haben auch immer prim\u00e4r die Erfahrung erw\u00e4hnt.\nIch bin aber dementsprechend nicht auf Entry-Level eingestiegen und habe die Junior-Stufe so \u00fcbersprungen.\nDa ich aber am Ende auch in Regelstudienzeit studiert habe und sehr gute Noten hatte, wei\u00df ich nicht, ob diese Studium-Faktoren ausschlaggebend waren, dass ich die Stelle bekommen hab, oder nicht. \n\nKommilitonen, die nicht so gute Noten hatten, aber auch paar Jahre Berufserfahrung, die hatten auch keine Probleme mit dem Einstieg und kamen \u00fcberall hin, wohin sie wollten.

This may sound odd, but academia is also a little bit showing off your vocab size \ud83d\ude05\nThat said, while I can discuss scientific topics on a deep level as I also read a lot of studies outside my field out of pure curiosity, last week, I went to a restaurant with a friend who couldn't speak German and I failed translating \"Schimmelk\u00e4se\".", "created_utc": "1653518502.0", "edited": "1653569029.0", "id": "i9zudvi", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_uxkrx8", "parent_id": "t3_uxkrx8", "score": "3", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "colutea", "body": "I had the same issue until I changed the compiler to pdflatex.\nI could type \u1e9e directly then without needing to use {\\ss} or anything like that.\n\nThese are the only German specific settings I use:\n\n```\n% Deutsch\n\\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}\n\\usepackage[ngerman]{babel}\n\\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}\n\\usepackage[autostyle=true,german=quotes]{csquotes}\n```\n\nMaybe try those settings first", "created_utc": "1653241177.0", "edited": "1653241792.0", "id": "i9l594t", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_uvbt55", "parent_id": "t3_uvbt55", "score": "1", "subreddit": "LaTeX", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhbn"}, {"author": "colutea", "body": "Just as a question, if you have been learning both for a few months, how do you get to the conclusion that you are at A2 in both (I am referring to your flair)?\nSorry for this upfront question, but I feel like many people underestimate A2 abilities. \n\nMarugoto has a list of A2 abilities for Japanese clustered by topics: https://a2.marugotoweb.jp/en/topic_and_cando_list/\n\nE.g. you should be able to read and understand this at A2: https://a2.marugotoweb.jp/ja/life_and_culture/topic/4/post1/3.html\n\nThis is an A1 exercise for comparison: https://a1.marugotoweb.jp/ja/can-do44.php\n\nIf you really are A2, you should have a solid basis to continue learning both if you can put in the time.

You can filter them by - of course- your target language but also by which other languages they speak and also by price range. \n\nThere are two types of tutors - community and professional. Many say that community tutors only do conversation classes and professional ones have more structured classes but I met community tutors as well who structure their classes more and professionals who don\u2019t. Professional tutors need to complete a certification to get that status. \n\nEach tutor has an introduction video where they present themselves and their methods as well as a description of which experience they had, which other languages they speak and how they teach (conversation classes, homework, which books, etc.). And of course you can see how much they charge for a class. \nYou can book 30 minute trial lessons with them which cost often less than 50% their usual rate. This is valuable when you want to get to know the teacher first. \nThere is also no contract like subscription as on Lingoda. You can book classes one by one or buy them in packages (like 5 classes which is cheaper than buying them individually) but you don\u2019t commit to buying more. \n\nThe prices vary but I think you can find a tutor that is within the price range that Lingoda has. \nI pay for instance for my Japanese community tutor  9 \u20ac for 45 minutes and for my French professional tutor 12\u20ac for 60 minutes. This is very cheap considering I have 1:1 classes with no other students I have to listen too. \n\nHow the classes are structured depends on you and your tutor. \nYou can ask the tutor about a curriculum and they can come up with one or you have already a textbook and go through it with the teacher or you only ask the teacher about one structure beforehand and the teacher will search for exercises for you which you do in the class. Or you only talk the whole class or read a book together or correct an essay you wrote. The classes are very flexible. If you want to have structured classes - ask them. If you want to focus on conversation- you can do that as well. \n\nI lately focus on conversation with my tutors because that is the area I lack the most - they provide me instant feedback and if they see that I struggle with one structure, they will prepare some exercises to revise them together.

Basically, you see the topics and you can book what you find most relevant. \n\nThey use PDFs which the teacher uses during the class. Basically, there is some vocab with example sentences and then grammar with some exercises. However, I found that the structure was very repetitive and it felt boring after a while. Also, the exercises were not very challenging and while there are some homework exercises, they don\u2019t really help to enforce the knowledge. There are 1-2 grammar exercises and the 3rd and 4th task are the same every class (Which words did you find hard?

We were supposed to read aloud the sentences in the PDF - everyone read one sentence and also for the grammar exercises we either typed them in the chat or everyone did 1 sentence in the exercises. There is no much time to go to deep into it and by the end of the class, you don\u2019t speak that much but rather listen to others.

My teacher was a native speaker so she also explained usage of phrases which are taught by a textbook but only used in certain situations. Downside is that you are exposed to many other people speaking bad Japanese (normal in the beginning) and you need to be aware of that to not pick up their pronunciation. When self-studying with Genki 1 before, I did everything with the CD so I was quite confident in my pronunciation and I was also happy to find that my teacher found it good as well. Basically I repeated everything on the CD. \n\nThey don\u2019t offer intermediate classes anymore so I was back at self studying. However, I noticed in class that I had some difficulties with speaking and grammar, so I signed up for an italki teacher. I take weekly 45 min 1:1 classes with a community tutor and we talk about general topics like what I did in the week, hobbies, culture, etc. \nI am learning a lot. My active usage capabilities are far beyond my passive ones and this really helps. Getting more confident in speaking Japanese and also learning phrases which are relevant to what I love talking about. Phrases which I would not find in a textbook. \n\nHowever, to also train the other skills, I use textbooks on the side. I don\u2019t go through them with my teacher, only if I find one grammar point hard. I think the value for me is bigger if I practice speaking instead of doing grammar exercises together which I can also do on my own (and being faster because I don\u2019t have to wait for my class). If I don\u2019t understand something, I have someone who I can ask. For the writing exercises, I use platforms like the italki community, HelloTalk or HiNative so I can get corrected. \n\nI really enjoy this approach with the combined approach - 1:1 classes and self study the most. I feel my progress is better and I am also more confident. In group classes you easily feel left behind or you feel like you are more far ahead and then miss the point where you don\u2019t.

My parents are both from Romania - my father has German ancestors, my mother Hungarian. That area where they are from basically consists of three different folks: People with Hungarian ancestors, German ones and entirely Romanian. The area belonged before WW1 to Austria-Hungaria and then became part of Romania. Basically, the people use their mother tongue (German, Hungarian) within their family and among friends and in school (schools were divided among languages) and used Romanian as a lingua franca (since childhood). So basically, every person there knows at least 2 languages at a native level.\nMy mother even knows all three of them at the fluent level with Hungarian the best (mother tongue) and German the least (but still C2).\nWell, they moved to Germany and I was born here. Until I was about 4 years old, I was able to communicate fluently (kid speech of course) in Hungarian and German (they didn\u2019t taught me Romanian because they didn\u2019t like that language for any reason). But then they moved to a conservative village where people told my parents that if they continue speaking two languages with me, I could never be fluent at both (the area was also kinda racist). So they stopped Hungarian and didn\u2019t talk to me in that language at all. What happened? I forgot 99% of it and until today, I can only say hello and happy birthday to my relatives.\nI could have gotten three languages for free - but I got only one in the end (which is German). They always tell me that I can learn Hungarian anytime by myself if I want to and I have an advantage cause I was fluent once. That is a mystery. While for me, I don\u2019t have difficulties to make the sounds Hungarian uses, I still lack grammar and vocabulary cause I never learnt them properly. If I wanted to learn it, I still need to undergo the same processes as someone who have never spoken this language before. The only difference is, I could have had it as my second mother tongue and it annoys me. In particular because my name is even Hungarian.\n\nI don\u2019t blame my parents because they didn\u2019t know it better that time. Even my teachers in elementary school tried to explain my introvert behavior with my foreign background. I was fluent in German and I loved writing stories and was among the top of the class. So my German skills were good. But still somehow I always had the feeling and was given the feeling by society that I don\u2019t belong there but I didn\u2019t know where I belong to. I was a kid. I didn\u2019t get why I am German but somehow Hungarian and I knew Hungarian but suddenly I shouldn\u2019t speak it anymore, etc etc. People in small, homogeneous contexts get anxious when people are different. I heard that in the last years, more and more immigrants moved to that area so the teachers and people are not like that anymore. Still in some degree but it got better. Still I can imagine that society has not overcome this yet entirely.\n\nI know, I could have starting to learn it now myself - but somehow I still felt hurt - so I didn\u2019t. I am also afraid to talk to my relatives in broken Hungarian - I feel ashamed. This is completely not rational and being able to talk a little is better than nothing - but overcoming this childhood issues is not easy unfortunately.
