Throughout college I felt so out of place because I didn't have a goal in mind; I just wanted to learn stuff, and apparently that wasn't justified enough.\n\nI'd hate to lower my standards. I know I may have to. But I'd hate for all this work to land me somewhere I could have been literally 6 years ago. Strangely, I HAVE applied to many roles that I'm over-qualified for. Like, literally 'office assistant' or 'publishing assistant,' where I'd seriously just be doing email tracking and calendars. But apparently I \"didn't meet their desired qualifications\" smh.. \n\nI've considered doing school again, but holding off for 2 reasons. 1, my transcript will not gain me admission into anything reputable, full stop. It's not abysmal, but they'd guaranteed say I'm not prepared for whatever. 2, I need to be in the right mindset for classwork. I just got off of years of feeling that all my academic work was worthless, hardly being able to keep a schedule and put my best foot forward as a result. My mental state is temperamental at the moment, so I don't want to pay for something unless I'm certain I want to buckle down and commit. In the meantime, there's online courses like OCW or Coursera, etc., which aren't degrees but at least I can say I have relevant knowledge.\n\nFor writing, I'm not sure what technical skill certifications or such exist, or are worth it. I'll look into it though. I feel like my best bet is simply getting a body of work behind me.\n\nFunnily enough I *have* considered doing freelance photography haha. So maybe that's really not a stretch. It's irritating to think that I'm back to nothing though; apparently really pushing myself to achieve in high school and go to a good uni was pointless, especially since I received next to no assistance or guidance along the way. Fortunately I have no debt, but again that just makes me feel horrible for having essentially wasted my family's savings on something that was a miserable experience and ultimately left me unprepared and behind afterwards..\n\nIt's reassuring to know you haven't had issues with mentioning or explaining gaps. For someone just starting out maybe it's a bit different, but I see there's tactics to deal with that.

Yeah I'll try to do better and explain gaps (if necessary) by providing more insight on the things I did outside of job searching. I have been involved in quite a bit, so maybe I should make a list and prepare to showcase them.\n2. I was hesitant to go with Upwork because of what I hear concerning low payment, high expectations, and cutthroat competition. But hopefully my area is niche enough  that I'll land some projects; I'd love to be paid ofc, but hell even just for the portfolio I'll do anything at this point. I contacted plenty of people from my uni (I live in the same city still) and they all said that sorry there aren't any projects for you --- meanwhile they advertise them to other people. Damn that hurt.\n3. I realize that science writing is limited in openings. As I said, I've been closely following job boards and newsletters for anything that sounds feasible. These listings insanely want PhD or post-doc people to write blog posts, it's inane. \n\nWhile I consider myself to be skilled enough for many of these positions, sadly I don't have a catalogue of work to point to. I've been caught in this mental predicament of thinking \"I need to have more work to show off, so let's sit down and produce something.\" But then I'm countered with a feeling of guilt, \"how can you take this time to 'find your voice' when you've been unemployed for this long? Do you realize how privileged you are? Most people don't have the opportunity to do unpaid work and 'soul-searching,' mental illness or not.\" Leading me to jump back into the job hunt, where I'm subsequently denied likely on the basis of being 'inexperienced.' It just irks me to no end that I feel I have so much potential, but that no one will listen unless I have prior experience (which I *kinda* do, but anyways..). WordPress it is!\n\n4. Ok, it seems we're in the same boat as far as over-preparing. For me that consisted of...haha...learning the history of the company, rereading the listing over and over to make sure I hit literally every point, reading up on (say) different research departments and familiarizing myself with the work these places do. Enough so that the interviewer really couldn't offer me much other info.. I guess it makes sense to present myself as a professional, whose time is limited, whose time is valuable, and exclusive.\n\nI'll definitely check out that channel! For me the biggest hurdle now is just getting seen through the algorithmic hellscape, but once I get a chance I should really make the most of it.\n\nIf there's anything I've come to realize, it's that capability plays a much lesser role than connection. Which sucks, cause I consider myself a highly capable person who's in want of professional connections, recommendations, and references. Sadly my time at uni did not lead to these necessities. \n\nI will pat myself on the back haha. It's been such an arduous and demeaning process, but the fact that I'm still here, revitalized, especially given my mental history, is worth noting.

It's true, I shouldn't worry as much about the opinions of those who aren't familiar with my day-to-day struggle, even if they are family; I have no intention of giving up, although the process certainly is regularly disheartening.\n\nYes, for all the interviews I can remember, I did follow up with the interviewer(s) afterwards, restating my interest and sometimes providing another piece of info if I thought it necessary. The majority, however, have just been with HR people, not people really familiar with the specifics of the job- so when I asked more pointed questions, they said they'd be better asked at the next round (which never came). I'm definitely responsive.\n\nThe vast majority of rejections I receive are the annoying auto-generated ones. Even for the few interviews I attended, the rejection came as a sort of 'no-reply' so I doubted anyone would listen if I asked for feedback. One rejection I did receive was hand-written; I then responded and set up a time to talk with them. The best experience so far hands-down. They offered me advice on my cover letter and I exchanged a Word doc a couple times with edits. They pointed me towards another opening and told me they've recommended me for this new position, so I desperately have my fingers crossed for this one!\n\nI'm very honest and candid in interviews, that's just my personality. I haven't brought up the gaps since they weren't mentioned, but maybe if I detail what I have been involved with in between (I think I've explained the volunteering), that could ease some reservations.\n\nHaha ok I'll try not to be too wide-eyed and excited. That's hard for me because obviously..uh..I *really* want the position. But maybe I'll treat it like poker or something, pretend to have some interest *if it's worth my time*.\n\nAh yes, Glassdoor. I've searched there a few times, but irritatingly they only let you view insights *once you list your previous employers*, which I have none. There's supposedly a student version, but I couldn't get it to work. I've done some other searching though, it's just writing in particular seems to be all over the place in terms of salary, and so many people do freelance now. One interview, I asked for literally *half* of what I later found their expectation was - so I guess I came off as confused, which I certainly was. The other maybe I overshot it, they gave me a salary band of 56-72k and I was like.. hmm 63. I really don't know.\n\nI realize that I can't base my worth off of others' success or lack thereof, but OOF is it tempting at this point.

You're right to note that \"memorizing and plugging in formulas\" isn't how the subject should be taught, so from the start you know that there's deeper significance to the concepts you learn at the beginning. Also, we're talking about a bachelor's level, not a graduate level, so again, it's really more the work ethic than anything else that will contribute to your success. I say since you have the demonstrated interest, you can go forward saying this is your plan, but realize that if you don't perform as well as you like, it's not like ALL of your classes at the moment have to deal with this subject, I'm assuming you have other core requirements as well?", "created_utc": "1617126538.0", "edited": "False", "id": "gstomvd", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_mglf7d", "parent_id": "t3_mglf7d", "score": "5", "subreddit": "Physics", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhi6"}, {"author": "eyaf20", "body": "She's done some solo stuff recently no?", "created_utc": "1616994695.0", "edited": "False", "id": "gsno12i", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_mf6xrs", "parent_id": "t1_gsmce8x", "score": "1", "subreddit": "Music", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1u"}, {"author": "eyaf20", "body": "It's funny in direct opposition to other people commenting, I wasn't a fan when they're stuff first got popular (which was middle school for me lol) but the newer Sacred Hearts Club is among my most played albums recently.", "created_utc": "1616817362.0", "edited": "False", "id": "gsdqaed", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_mdridl", "parent_id": "t1_gsbpppc", "score": "2", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i"}, {"author": "eyaf20", "body": "As someone with SAD and ACHOO I'm very familiar with how scientists manipulate these acronyms for pleasure", "created_utc": "1616739258.0", "edited": "False", "id": "gs9ieeg", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_md7fs0", "parent_id": "t1_gs86k1i", "score": "2", "subreddit": "science", "subreddit_id": "t5_mouw"}, {"author": "eyaf20", "body": "I was in your shoes. I kind of still am. Here's what I can say. The sooner I simply focused on what I truly wanted to study and put my effort into that, instead of on the name of the place, the better situation I would be in. It was agony watching many of my peers get into the schools I applied to, while I had what all my teachers and advisors thought was a stronger chance. I got one rejection, two acceptances, and six pointless waitlists. I felt like I had failed myself and failed to live up to others' expectations as well. If you're intent on attending a T20, it's still possible to investigate transfer admissions - hell that's what I actually did. But I'll say what I wasn't prepared for was the feeling when I started sophomore year, having spent a miserable year at one school where I didn't feel I belong, instead of treating it as a formative experience I treated it as a sentence. After transfer, I was infuriated, wondering how so many of my new peers were able to \"best\" me in admissions when so many frankly didn't seem that impressive or academically committed. It's not a game you can win - you're not really going to \"realize what was wrong\" with your app or yourself it seems. I've spent much too long fretting over how I felt I failed once, and this has held me back: I felt like an imposter, and despite my promise I did not let myself flourish in college because I took the admissions game too seriously, assuming that they somehow knew more about me than I did. It's incorrect, and not worth thinking twice about, let alone allowing it to consume you for years. I felt I was never \"good enough\" for this program or that, this or that major, and stifled my own experience feeling that I was never truly meant to belong. The mental illness I had in hs became exacerbated to such a level I didn't think I would survive; I did the unthinkable of earning an F, several C's, and withdrew from 3 courses. I finally got a bit of control towards the end, but im still astounded that me, someone who takes this academic stuff so seriously and has always been an enormously pensive and analytical person, has this as part of my \"official\" record. I have since graduated T20 with a major nobody has heard of and a mediocre-to-sour gpa that gives me grief. As I say, the only thing I got from school was a degree. It wasn't to do with the \"elite rigor,\" it's because I couldn't accept myself, believe in myself, and be decisive and take control of my college experience because it never unfolded in any way I ever expected. I have now become more at peace with the past several years, but I still often wonder about where I \"could be\" had I not fallen into this pit. Please don't let the disappointing sting of this moment limit you further on. A T20 degree is lovely (and not inaccessible to you, again transfer or for a later grad program), but it does not win anyone over on name alone - I and many friends of mine have been hunting for months now in the job search, and I can assure you people are more interested in what you do with the education available to you, the orgs and internships you get involved with, than the school's name. People I consider mentors who attended college I had never even heard of are accomplished working at highly selective companies and T10 PhD programs. None of this is out of your reach based on your first year of college, but I urge you to define what it is you want to study and get involved with, and the opportunities will follow.

American universities are uniquely flexible in the academic world. Could you change your major on a whim at the last minute before getting your bachelors?

It's very common to start with one designated major when you start college, and end up with a different one, or pick up another along the way.

That means you have a broader background, and assuming you take the \"core\" or \"prerequisite\" classes your first year or so, you're in a good position to change majors if you desire. Btw, your high school credits will count towards these classes. I wouldn't fret over \"what fields you can go into\" with your current course selection - unless it's highly specialized, they're expecting the normal range of classes that high schoolers take. In college you'll have an advisor, and if you make a change to your plans, they'll go over it with you, you'll talk with members of the department you're switching into. If it's a big switch, they just want to make sure that you cover all the requirements for the major - this could be changing your schedule to fit in required classes to catch up in that area, or maybe an extension to your program if necessary.

I take time to read plenty, and I've been on language exchange apps regularly as well though I tend to stick just to texting. This has reinforced my understanding of the language, and given me some new vocab, however in the instances I've gone to actually speak and carry a conversation, my competence drops enormously. So while I can easily read and write at a C level, my conversations remain B at best. \n\nFrench in particular is deceptive (at least to me) because there are lots of cognates and the sentence structure can in many cases mirror English, but when conversing with someone I'm routinely thrown off because I'm not used to the pronunciation, even if the word/phrase is expressed similarly in English.\n\nI can be a shy person, so practicing a foreign language out loud can be doubly intimidating. Two things I've done recently to combat this but not get filled w anxiety:\n--Consume media like tv shows, podcasts, YouTube channels, audiobooks  and music.- you'll get exposure to pronunciation and be able to better pair words you've read with how they sound in the wild and understand the structure and cadence of sentences. \n-- Subvocalize -- what i was taught in school, even if you're just reading or writing, take time to speak under your breath or whisper- speaking out loud is of course the best but not always possible. \n-- formulate your thoughts in your target language. Narrate what you're doing and how you're feeling at the moment, if only in your head. It can be good to be sporadic and have instances of language practice throughout the day instead of just devoting a particular time slot to study and then ignoring it otherwise. \n\nSo overall, there's nothing wrong with prioritizing writing if that's what you want. It certainly won't hurt you, but it depends how you intend to use your language skills that determines what aspects to practice. I've been thinking of working abroad, and so while reading and writing is great, spoken and listening skills are also mandatory. Being well rounded I feel is the best approach, but again it depends what you hope to do with it; in any real world setting, it's best to cover all your bases. Language exchange apps can be tricky because you type and revise your writing much slower and more methodically than you would speak.
