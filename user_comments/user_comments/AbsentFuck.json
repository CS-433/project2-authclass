When I changed my gender to male I had the opposite issue: ads for whiskey, watches, work boots, etc. Certain platforms have agendas they want to push, irrespective of user preference. It used to be a frequent discussion topic for a time on the childfree sub a while back. Women getting annoyed at all the targeted baby ads on certain apps, and changing their gender to male within those apps to stop it.\n\nIt could very well be a bug, but myself and many people here have seen the ways in which any criticism of trans ideology is suppressed on other social media outlets.

I also had pretty deep seated internalized misogyny and a not like other girls complex.\n\nBut then I started listening to my doubts. I entertained that voice that said \"you know all of this trans stuff makes no sense\" instead of running away from it. I realized gender roles are not a requirement to be a woman (or a man), I wasn't failing at womanhood because I couldn't get the hang of performing femininity. I couldn't get the hang of it because it's a lot of fucking work and I'm too lazy to doll myself up on a regular basis.\n\nWanting a dick didn't make me male, having masculine coded hobbies didn't make me male, having thick body hair and a low voice didn't make me male. I realized that thinking those things made me \"more of a guy and less of a girl\" was regressive and sexist. \n\nNowadays I just roll my eyes and scoff at trans people who use stereotypes and bodily discomfort to justify their transness.

I see medical transition the same way I see cosmetic surgery or getting tattoos. Are you an adult of sound mind looking to achieve a specific aesthetic? Go for it, as long as you're aware of the risks.\n\nThe issue that leads a lot of people to this sub is most people who transition are _not aware_ of the risks, nor are they presented with alternatives to transitioning, because doctors refuse to tell them and the trans community hides the brutal reality of what medical transition can entail. They are told that transitioning is the only way to cure their dysphoria, and they're pushed to a point of no return. More often than not the process goes very quickly with little to no screening other than \"do you hate being a girl/boy?\" Some people here report going into a gender clinic to address dysphoria and walking out with hormones the same day. They are understandably angry and heartbroken because they're left with a body that is permanently altered in a way they couldn't prepare for because they were lied to.\n\nMost people would not medically transition if they were fully aware of how risky it is. There are trans people who regret medically transitioning, and this sub is the only place they can voice those feelings without getting torn apart by their pro-trans peers.\n\nI still think you need to first get comfortable with the idea that womanhood isn't a performance before you consider hormones and surgery. But if after all of that you still want a flatter chest and a deeper voice for the aesthetic of being a manly woman, go for it. I don't advise getting bottom surgery in any context though. The rate of infection and complication is just too high.", "created_utc": "1663081634.0", "edited": "False", "id": "io9lw61", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_xb74xz", "parent_id": "t1_io999q9", "score": "3", "subreddit": "detrans", "subreddit_id": "t5_3pyg0"}, {"author": "AbsentFuck", "body": ">Are trans women actual women, and are trans men actual men? Whats the science behind it? If they are i want to be respectful. And what does intersex mean?\n\nNo. Trans people are trans. They are not actual women or men. There isn't any science behind it. Trans people like to cite a study that found brain similarities between gay men and straight women, as well as straight men and lesbians as \"proof\" that male and female brains are different. But that's not what that study proves. That study proves sexuality is innate and there are structures in the brain which reflect that.  They proved you can tell if someone is attracted to men or attracted to women via a brain scan, regardless of that person's sex.\n\nIntersex, as I understand it, is a chromosomal/genetic abnormality that can cause one's genitalia to look ambiguous at birth. The terms AFAB and AMAB were co-opted from the intersex community because intersex infants are sometimes surgically \"assigned\" a sex at birth. When the child grows up, they develop in a way that is at odds with their assigned sex.\n\nIntersex conditions can also cause other developmental abnormalities around puberty, but I'm not familiar with what all of them are. But the bottom line is that intersex people are not a third sex. They are not proof that sex is a spectrum. They are still either male or female, they simply have a sex specific condition.\n\n>Ive read autism and being trans is related. Noticed this alot on reddit too. Why are they related? Someone told me its bc autistic people are more open minded, is that it?\n\nAutistic people tend to take things very literally. If they are being told that women are X and men are Y they take that literally, when in reality those are just social norms. But social norms that come naturally to most people don't come naturally to autistic people. This leads them to feel isolated and alienated from their peers. Trans rhetoric gives them a way to feel a sense of community in an area of life that's very confusing for them.\n\nAutistic people want to have reasons for why the world works the way it does, but with gender norms the \"reason\" is usually \"that's just how it is\". This isn't a good enough answer to an autistic person, they still don't understand _why_ they have to look or behave a certain way just because they happen to be male or female. This confusion often compounds and leads to intense gender dysphoria.\n\nMany autistic people have sensory issues that make performing gender roles very uncomfortable. The feeling of makeup on one's face, wearing heels, the fabric a lot of women's clothes are made from, etc can be impossible for some autistic girls to tolerate. This leads them to think they're \"failing\" at womanhood if they can't perform those stereotypes comfortably, which then leads them to think they must be a man instead.\n\nThen there's the issue of masking. People expect boys and girls to behave a certain way, but if they are autistic their behavior is seen as abnormal and problematic. Some autistic children learn how to mask their autism in order to function in society. But if they have trouble masking, this can again, lead them to think they're failing at being a boy or a girl correctly.", "created_utc": "1663072708.0", "edited": "False", "id": "io9012z", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_xcwvow", "parent_id": "t3_xcwvow", "score": "33", "subreddit": "detrans", "subreddit_id": "t5_3pyg0"}, {"author": "AbsentFuck", "body": ">I think by end of this century every single white man will be gay/trans while we have an invasion from the continent east/south of Europe.\n\nWay to not only be a sexist asswipe, but also a white supremacist.

On TV men and women can be friends, but IRL what usually ends up happening is the woman is fuckzoned by her male \"friend\". He's only friends with her because he hopes to sleep with her someday. Even if he's in a relationship, he would still sleep with his female friend given the opportunity. I actually came across a video on TikTok the other day where a man admitted that most men would literally fuck every woman they encounter, even if they wouldn't date them for whatever reason.\n\nPeople internalize this, and they recognize how unlikely it is that a man would have a cordial relationship with a woman he isn't at all interested in having sex with. So when they see a woman and a man who claim to be friends in the media, they have a compulsion to see them in a sexual context, because the presented context is so unfamiliar and counter to their lived experience.\n\nThe other factor I think comes into play is fandom culture. From my Tumblr days the loudest and most active contributors to fandom culture were young girls who have some form of mental illness or trauma. Most of them have never been in a romantic relationship and are starved for romantic affection. They want this affection anywhere they can get it, even if it means creating fictional scenarios in their minds to scratch that itch.

The fact that you're here at all is very telling, and not in a good way. If I was in a relationship and after a few years my partner decided they wanted kids, I would not be in a parenting sub asking for advice on how to change my stance. \n\nI would end that relationship. It would hurt, but it would be necessary, because at the end of the day this isn't something I'm compromising on, and I would never change a core part of myself to please someone else. I would miss my partner, but I know I can be okay without them.\n\nAnyway, here's the list of questions:\n\nAre you prepared to be pregnant? It's not just about swollen feet, morning sickness, and cravings. You could miscarry, more than once. You could get pre-eclampsia, you could get gestational diabetes, your bones could become permanently brittle from the fetus sucking calcium from you. You could lose teeth.\n\nAre you prepared for possibly having a stillborn?\n\nAre you prepared for childbirth? Are you prepared to possibly get ripped open from clit to asshole? Because that happens more often than you think. A lot of mothers report that they pee a little every time they sneeze due to loss of pelvic muscle strength, do you want that? Do you want to risk bleeding out if you have to have a C-section? My mom almost bled out with me.\n\nAre you prepared for the possibility of postpartum depression? What about postpartum psychosis?\n\nAre you prepared to literally never get a full night of sleep while your child is an infant? I don't know if you've never been truly sleep deprived before, but it's used as a form of torture in some places for good reason.\n\nAre you prepared for the possibility that your baby could suddenly die from SIDS?\n\nAre you prepared to be stressed over how to feed your infant if you're unable to breastfeed? There's a formula shortage right now.\n\nAre you prepared to have a messy house almost constantly when your toddler can walk? \n\nAre you prepared to constantly, and I mean _constantly_ have to watch your small child because if you take your eyes off them for two seconds they will put themselves in danger? Sure, it night be cute at first, but when it's happening all the time it can get very tiring.\n\nAre you prepared to handle the guilt should the worst happen in the above scenario and you took your eyes off your child for a second too long?\n\n\nAre you prepared for your partner to neglect his fatherly duties? Even if your boyfriend did still want kids 100%, statistically speaking the bulk of the parenting will fall to you, and that will take a toll no matter how much you love him and your kids. The fact that he's not so sure anymore means he will likely resent you and your kids if you tried to convince him to have them anyway.\n\nAre you prepared to deal with a neurodivergent child that is very difficult to parent, much moreso than just an \"annoying toddler\" or a \"moody teenager\"?\n\nAre you prepared to care for a child with a severe mental and/or physical disability that negatively impacts their quality of life and makes it impossible for them to ever take care of themselves?\n\nAre you prepared to comfort a daughter if she is ever raped or assaulted? 1 in 6 women in America is sexually assaulted in her lifetime, and those are just the reported cases.\n\nAre you prepared to properly discipline a son if he rapes someone?\n\nAre you prepared to handle a suicidal teenager?\n\nAre you prepared for the daily anxiety of worrying that you'll be woken up with a phone call that something has happened to one of your kids?\n\nAre you prepared for the possibility that your kids could hate you for birthing them? I don't necessarily hate my mom for having me, but the more I look around at the state of the world, the more I'm resentful that I have to suffer through capitalism, the bs of being a woman, and the shit show of the US government, etc due to my mother's selfish desire for companionship.\n\nAre you prepared to financially support and/or house your children well into their 30s? Again, looking at the state of the world, more and more young people are not moving out because they simply can't afford to. Many can't afford rent, houses, gas, groceries, etc, and that is only getting worse.\n\nAre you prepared to damage your kids emotionally? Because you will, no matter how much you try not to. Especially since you say you have no purpose outside of being a mother. Kids aren't stupid, they'll notice that.\n\nThere's a ton of other drawbacks, but those are things to think about.", "created_utc": "1661141952.0", "edited": "1661142231.0", "id": "ila5y3f", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_wu9thq", "parent_id": "t3_wu9thq", "score": "8", "subreddit": "childfree", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qtwb"}, {"author": "AbsentFuck", "body": "I really don't mean to come off as harsh or mean, but if you admit you aren't passionate about much, and aren't good at much, how do you expect to be a good role model for your potential kids?

She promised to make sure we always felt loved.\n\nBut her upbringing has brought out a lot of negativity in her. For example, she can't take criticism about her parenting at all, especially if it comes from one of her kids.

They don't take into account that they could give birth to a mass murderer, rapist, etc. They don't consider that their child could be born into a world where they will always have to struggle and fight to stay alive. They don't think about that their child could have some kind of mental disability which makes it impossible for them to thrive.\n\nThe lower-middle class couples right now who are complaining about the cost of living, worried about the rise of fascism, scared about school shootings in America, but still trying to have a baby really piss me off. Because they see everything wrong with the world but still have this compulsion to add another life to that suffering. Stuff like that really stirs up my anti natalist feelings.\n\nI see the \"logic\" behind having children during rough times back when humanity didn't have contraceptives.

If you truly do regret medically transitioning and assuming a trans identity you can sit with those feelings as long as you need to. If they turn out to be true you can detrans and desist. You don't owe your subscribers anything. If facing the backlash of detransitioning is too much you can leave YouTube quietly.\n\nI have to ask though, do you think being excited to wear \"feminine\" clothing and use feminine hygiene products makes you a woman? Because it doesn't. Why was your first thought \"maybe I regret transitioning\" and not \"sweet, I could be a feminine man since I like wearing feminine clothing\"? If you truly believe yourself to be a man, then wearing feminine clothes would have no bearing on your manhood. You would be no different than other natal men who are gender nonconforming. \n\nLikewise, why did being excited to wear masculine clothing factor into your decision to transition in the first place? Would you call butch lesbians men because they wear men's clothes? \n\nIt sounds to me like the novelty of transitioning has worn off, and now that you're a \"man\", wearing feminine clothing feels taboo, and there's a new novelty associated with it that makes you excited.\n\nThe truth is, you've been a woman this entire time. A woman who identifies as a man, who has had a mastectomy, and is taking testosterone, but a woman nonetheless. Detransitioning would simply mean you'd no longer be running from that fact.\n\nThe clothing you wear has no bearing on your womanhood. It doesn't matter how comfortable or uncomfortable you are presenting in a masculine or feminine way, you are still a woman regardless. If you are ready to take that step, learn to embrace that womanhood (or manhood) does not come with requirements. It is not a performance dictated by how you dress or what products you use. You don't mention regretting hormones, so you could even stay on testosterone if you wanted and simply drop the trans label. You could rebrand your channel as an extremely masculinized woman who is on T, but does not identify as trans. I'd subscribe to you right away if you did!\n\nThere is already a man on YouTube who does this. Look up John MacLean. He is a heavily feminized man who passes better than most transwomen imo, but he is not trans and has never claimed to be trans.

But somewhere along the way transgenderism got mixed in with LGB. I think that's a big part of why this took off so much. People are being told that being trans is the same as being same sex attracted, and if you support the LGB, you must also support the T. Old school transsexuals recognized that there was some overlap between the communities (like being gender nonconforming), but that fundamentally they were not the same. \n\nNowadays the trans movement is piggybacking off of gay rights, and coupled with the fact that the community is referred to as \"LGBT\", it cements the idea in people's minds that they're the same. That gives them leverage to be very aggressive with their politics. \n\nThe problem is that being same sex attracted doesn't require anything from anyone else. It doesn't require that people refer to you with a new name and new pronouns, it doesn't require surgery and hormones, it doesn't require that people redefine their sexualities (or invent new ones) to accommodate your identity, and it doesn't require that anyone change the definitions of what it means to be male or female. But being trans requires all of that. So they _have_ to go above and beyond with the brainwashing. Because if they don't then people will realize that no, it's actually not \"just like being gay\".\n\nEdited to add that back in the day, some LGBs would transition as a way to escape homophobia, and that is still happening today. That's why a lot of \"normies\" see trans people as just gay people who were suffering. Because for a while, that was true. So that probably also contributed to our communities getting mashed together. But they are still fundamentally different. The trans narrative used to be built on \"I was born in the wrong body, I am not okay and I need to change my body to match my mind\", the LGB narrative is built on \"I was born like this, and that is okay, I don't need to change a thing.\"", "created_utc": "1658500727.0", "edited": "1658514879.0", "id": "ih70eiw", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_w5694k", "parent_id": "t1_ih6xzvs", "score": "65", "subreddit": "detrans", "subreddit_id": "t5_3pyg0"}, {"author": "AbsentFuck", "body": "Yes to everything you said.

But I try to remind myself that I don't hate trans people for being trans, I hate the narcissism, homo/biphobia, desire to socially crucify anyone they disagree with, and conservative views on gender that they spew while packaging it in a trans box.

Because I don't see being contradictory to that extent as a human thing unless someone never does any kind of introspection. I don't see that as just a normal human behavior to the degree that I see it in trans communities. I see the same level of contradictions in far right religious ideologies, which makes sense given how much trans ideology overlaps with conservative religious dogma when you really peel back the layers. Those ideals attract a certain type of person, and those types of people tend to never look at themselves to make sure their beliefs are consistent and logically sound. They want a belief system that works in their favor all the time, so it doesn't have to make sense.\n\nI'm not saying we're saints by any means, nor am I saying we can't fall victim to holding contradictory beliefs in other areas. But that doesn't change the fact that holding contradictory beliefs seems to be required to be in the trans community, whether someone is trans themselves or just an ally. Before desisting I had two ftm friends who admitted to feeling like some tenants of transgenderism didn't make sense. But their solution to addressing that was \"I just try not to think about it too hard.\" I did the exact same thing. I had doubts about certain things the entire time I IDed as trans. I figured there was just something I was missing or something I just didn't understand yet, and when I learned that elusive thing everything would make sense. But that moment never came. Instead I just kept finding more and more holes in the ideology until I couldn't ignore them anymore. It's why I'm sus of trans people who claim to be gender critical. Being gender critical is at odds with almost every single tenet of transgenderism, and I don't see how someone can hold both belief systems without their head exploding.\n\nMaybe the trans people who say the things in the bingo sheet just haven't gotten to that point yet. Maybe they don't see where the logic breaks down. Maybe you're right and most people don't read much into it and I'm thinking about this too hard.

We're responding to being dismissed and mistreated by a certain group of people, and trying to put a humorous spin on that.\n\nI think we're very empathetic to trans people, seeing as pretty much everyone here has been trans before. Question posts show up here every so often where someone is wondering why trans people do the things they do, and I've posted comments that I feel do a decent job of explaining how the mind of a \"crazy\" trans person works without demonizing them (though I will admit many of my comments have angry undertones). But the fact that this space was even needed in the first place speaks volumes. If trans communities were as welcoming and inclusive as they say, they should have no problem with detransitioners existing within it. But they aren't, and that makes people understandably angry and frustrated with them. I empathize with being dysphoric and unhappy, and with the hurt that settles in when others won't see you as your preferred sex.

Compared to some other writing systems it is 'easy'. But I think 'simple' would be a better word to describe it. Because simple does not imply easy. Lifting weights is a simple process, but it is not an easy one. Hangul is the same. It is a simple writing system, but if your native language is English, training your brain to read a non-Roman alphabet in syllable blocks instead of a string of single letters is A Task.\n\nKorean teachers and Korean learners alike will say learning hangul can be done in a few hours. Don't listen to them. _Familiarizing_ with hangul can be done in a few hours, but actually learning it takes much longer than that.

But it goes deeper than that. They're trying to leverage the fact that black women are seen as more masculine than other races of women due to us not matching European beauty standards. They then draw a comparison to trans women who don't pass by saying \"trans women don't need to pass in order to be seen as women! Just look at black women, they're manly too!\" And that's where I get pissed off because society's view of black women as masculine is not at all the same as a **literal man** trying to be a woman. They legit forget that black women are _actually female_ and that's why we count as women. They think womanhood is all about perception and appearances.\n\nIt angers me so much because they don't even know the full extent of why we are seen as masculine. I've had to explain this to so many people that it doesn't just stop at appearance. Yes, our overall bone structure does contribute, but black people in general are seen as more aggressive than white people. Aggression is viewed as a masculine trait so you can see where that line of thinking comes from. That has little to do with beauty standards and everything to do with racism.\n\nFurthermore, in my personal experience, the main ones calling us masculine are not white people, and they aren't doing it because of our appearance. It's black men calling us masculine and they do it because black women have realized they don't NEED a man to survive. They've realized it's more beneficial to them to not rely on a man for everything and have assumed a role in relationships that traditionally would fall on the man: making more money, being independent, etc. \n\nBecause many black women have decided they no longer need black men, black men feel threatened by this. Rather than trying to be better men, they've thrown their hands up and said \"black women are too masculine nowadays. They act like they want to be men now. How dare they make more money than me and not want to rub my feet and cook me dinner every night?\"\n\nBut these trans activists don't know that part.

If I saw you randomly standing at a birthday party holding balloons and dressed like a clown I would wonder \"who is this random person dressed as a clown here? Did we hire a clown? Should we call the police?\" The outfit alone is not enough for me to ask you to do a silly dance or something. If on the other hand you were invited, and were actively handing out those balloons to kids at the party then I would ask you to put on an act.\n\nLikewise, a girl or woman showing skin, by itself, is not a beacon of invitations to be asked for sex, harassed, or catcalled. Maybe it's hot out. Maybe she thinks the top is cute. Maybe it's a designer outfit she saved up to get and she's excited to wear it. Just because her \"tits are showing\" does not mean that it is now open season on her body and she should relinquish her right to basic respect.\n\nYou mention that this teenage girl has been exhibiting provocative behavior.

What did she expect?' we need to normalize the idea that unless a girl or woman is actively asking for sex with her words and actions, we need to stop putting the blame on her outfit.

I convinced myself that hating the way I was treated as a girl due to sexism was one thing, but if I hated my female body parts and functions then surely that has nothing to do with sexism right?\n\nWell, no. I think gender dysphoria can cause and worsen sex dysphoria in trans people, and if you dig far enough with most trans people you'll get to the root of that discomfort. A lot of trans guys I've talked to mention being disappointed they could no longer go topless when they started growing breasts. Or they got a ton of unwanted attention because of their breasts. Or people started treating them differently when they hit puberty. Or they had a bad experience with their dad/brother/boyfriend/male friend/etc being weird about their periods. Many of them are also victims of sexual assault.\n\nThose things are all symptoms of gender at work, but for those trans guys it caused resentment for their female bodies that wasn't there before, or it made existing resentment much more intense.\n\nNot to mention sex dysphoria without gender dysphoria doesn't cause people to transition. I would argue that women who get breast reductions due to back pain experience sex dysphoria. Breasts, generally, are considered a female sex characteristic, and dysphoria is defined as \"a state of unease or generalized dissatisfaction with life\". So if a woman's breasts are causing physical pain and a dissatisfaction with life, I'd count that as sex dysphoria. Same for women with PCOS or endometriosis. Many childfree people of both sexes are dissatisfied with their fertility and seek ways to permanently disable it.\n\nThese people aren't transitioning though. Because being unhappy with one's sexed body parts and functions, by itself, doesn't cause someone to transition.\n\nI think you're right in that sex dysphoria and gender dysphoria are two different things. Id say I still have a lot of sex dysphoria. I hate having a period and dealing with sharp pains in my side every month when I ovulate.

It is recognizing that a man who is on estrogen, has implants, wears a full face of makeup and dresses is no less of a man than his more traditional lumberjack neighbor down the street. He might want to be called \"she\" but choosing not to is not disrespecting him in any way. \n\nHere's an analogy: I used to want to be white when I was little. I got so much crap for my interests from my parents, my bookishness from my peers, and a ton of other bs that comes with being black. I remember one instance clearly of trying to download a song by Finger Eleven on my computer. My mom saw, and scoffed at me saying \"what's that sticky finger white group you're looking at?\" This was a common occurrence, and after a while I started to wish I was white so I could like what I liked in peace. After all, I identified more with what I thought was white culture. I was tired of people assuming I was less intelligent than my white peers. Why couldn't I just tell people I'd rather be seen as white, and have them refer to me as such? I'm not hurting anyone, right? It doesn't really affect anyone, right? They're just words after all.\n\nWould you say I was disrespected by people who continued to refer to me as black? \n\nIf not, how is this situation different from continuing to use pronouns for trans people that refer to their sex? Race and gender are both social constructs with unfortunate real life implications, so what would be the difference between these two situations? \n\nIf so, I'm very curious to know how this could be viewed as disrespectful.\n\n\nMen who prefer to live life with extremely feminized appearances should still be able to be called men. Gender identity theory tells us we should be okay with using female pronouns for them because according to gender identity theory, there is a threshold between what counts as a woman and a man that has nothing to do with biology. That is what I have a problem with. Why do we have to refer to some extremely feminine men as \"she\" or some extremely masculine women as \"he\" just because they prefer it that way?

Why would they look? \n\nIt is potentially fatal for men to receive blood from women who have been pregnant in the past.

There are lives and well being at stake for everyone involved.\n\nThat doesn't even get into the sociological implications of having words like \"she, her, woman, female\" watered down by allowing male individuals to use them for themselves. If we say it's ok to call biologically male individuals \"she\" provided they are \"feminine enough\" by means of hormones, surgeries, makeup, hair, dresses, and the like, what are we implying about bio women who are not those things? Are we saying that to be called \"she\" one must have breasts, look pretty, and be soft-spoken? Must flat chested women revoke their right to be called \"she\" if a man can buy his way into that identity artificially with implants? Are GNC women who are mistaken for men not deserving of being called \"she\" simply because they don't look the part?

Basing womanhood on anything beyond that, using the confines of gender, would automatically exclude most of those women.\n\nPeople have mangled the definitions of very simple terms like \"woman\" and \"man\" to fit a society that has its claws in sexist stereotypes and rigid expectations.

Some LGBT people have for example reclaimed the \"queer\" slur. I have seen some trans people refer to themselves as \"tr-nny\" in a joking way, but I would never call a trans person this, because it is not my word to reclaim, even if I meant it jokingly.

Ever. My friends and I don't even use this word to each other unless we are talking explicitly about someone being racist.

The reasoning of \"it's because it brought your average age of credit history down\" made no sense to me because it shouldn't matter whether the loan is still being paid or not.

If someone gets in trouble with credit cards it can be indicative of a spending problem and an inability to repay loans on time. And, at least in the US (not familiar with how it works elsewhere), a lot of credit cards reward you for using them. So if you use them responsibility you can get a lot of free stuff in the form of cash back, hotel stays, airline miles, store credit, etc just for using a credit card for your normal spending and paying it off on time.\n\nI do think overall that many lenders don't look at the big picture sometimes and focus too much on credit.

This sense of unease or dissatisfaction may be so intense it can lead to depression and anxiety and have a harmful impact on daily life.\n\nThis says nothing about knowing where that unease comes from.

Misogyny and the normalization of women as sex objects are the problem, which was created by and is perpetuated mostly by men.

Because those people are not the root cause of the problem. The root cause is the prevalence of unnecessary sugars and salts in American foods, the fact that processed food is cheaper than healthy food for low income households, the lack of healthier options in vending machines and fast food restaurants, zoning laws that keep low income households in food deserts, suburban sprawl that leads to unwalkable and unbikable cities in America, and the lack of affordable healthcare. We don't talk about those outliers that make good money, have the means to exercise, have access to healthy foods and the means to prepare it, and have good health insurance when we discuss the deeper systemic issues because they are not the real issue here.\n\nThe same goes for women who choose, without being groomed, forced, or coerced, to do porn. Not because we don't think they shouldn't be held accountable for their actions, but because spending energy on them is counterproductive. Their behavior is irrelevant to this particular discussion.

Someone somewhere  said something to the effect of, when you watch top female athletes you know they fought hard to be that strong. They've conditioned their bodies to be at peak physical fitness and that's an amazing accomplishment. However, while it's true that the average man will still be stronger than the strongest woman, he didn't earn that strength. He was born that way and did little to no work to outperform a well conditioned female athlete.\n\nThat really helped me. I started to look at strength the way I look at wealth.. Someone born into a rich family who has a net worth of $10mil didn't have to work for that money. The work was done for them already. Whereas someone who starts off poor and  amasses a net worth of $5mill is impressive. They might only have half as much money as the person born rich, but I see their wealth as more impressive because they had to work for it.\n\nIt's not a perfect analogy, but it works well enough imo.

I'm not arguing for this.\n\nI said that the common viewpoint: \"femininity is inherently submissive and masculinity is inherently dominant\" is a misogynistic one.  The reason I think this is misogynistic is because whenever a person is being submissive and degraded in porn, that person is either female or feminine in some way. If being a woman was not seen as a worse thing to be than being a man, people would not feel this compulsion to degrade women and feminine men to such an extent.\n\nI do not think masculinity in any form is automatically a hatred for femininity, although many people believe being masculine automatically means hating femininity. I do not share this view, it's one of many things in society I'd like to see die. I think masculinity can and does exist without hatred for femininity coming along with it. The same way I think femininity can be dominant and masculinity can be submissive. \n\n>If a gay man acts feminine and his partner is masculine, then isn't the underlying assumption that he hates the feminine aspect of his partner because his partner is acting submissive ? \n\nNot necessarily. But there are unfortunately gay men who do find feminine gay men detestable for misogynistic reasons. Again, I don't think being masculine automatically makes you misogynistic. There are plenty of masculine people with feminine partners who don't hate them for being feminine. This applies to lesbian couples as well.\n\n>Isn't this more about the smut peddlers trying to cater to their target demographic? \n\nTheir target demo is men, who are used to having orgasms easily whether alone or with a partner. I doubt these same men would watch femdom porn where the man doesn't finish (not counting edging fetishes here). As you said, the point is for the viewer to insert himself in place of the male actor. And it's unsatisfying, to most men watching that kind of porn, if the man doesn't get off. My point with this is that the majority of porn is centered around male pleasure regardless of who is dominant and who is submissive, which is a separate form of more generalized misogyny in my eyes because it devalues female pleasure even when she's in a position of power.\n\n>Does that mean if porn was more like a romance novel or neutrally passive as participants , neither taking a dominant or submissive role (even though technically penetration is often seen as a key element of sex) that it would not be misogynistic? \n\nI think it would result in less misogynistic porn, yes. Because as I said before, a lot of the power dynamics in porn are centered on the belief that submissiveness is bad and deserving of degradation, because many people think submissiveness is feminine, and they view femininity as bad. I don't agree with this, but this is what I see around me and I saw a lot of it in porn.\n\n>Is only fans/ or cam girls who only degrade themselves , is this also misogynistic?\n\nYes. Because those girls' misogyny is internalized.

Thinking women are inherently bad and hating anything associated with femaleness and femininity is the definition of misogyny.\n\nIf women were not seen as inferior, inherently worse than men, and deserving of abuse by so many people, then femininity would not be nearly as taboo for men to engage in. It's also the reason homophobia is ultimately tied to misogyny for both sexes. For gay men, it's wrong to be attracted to other men because \"taking a dick is feminine. Fucking a guy is only for women.\" For lesbians it's \"how dare you not know your place as a woman and not be attracted to men!?\" \n\nThis leaks into people's sex lives where in gay porn the feminine men are choked, slapped, spit on, called slurs, etc. The same way women are treated. I used to watch a lot of porn and it was exceedingly rare to see masculine, dominant men get treated this way. Because only femininity can be degraded and shown in a submissive light. This stems from the misogynistic assumption by many that woman deserve that kind of treatment, because we're women. And anyone who assumes a woman-adjacent role in the bedroom must automatically be submissive.\n\nRegarding dominatrix fetishes, there's a write up somewhere I read about that too, but I can't find it at the moment. But basically it said that even in porn where the woman is dominating the man, the man's pleasure is still the main focus. So ultimately it's not a true reverse of situations where a man dominates a woman. In both scenarios the man is guaranteed to get off. The woman, not so much. The sexual gratification is still in the man's favor.", "created_utc": "1645486946.0", "edited": "1645487161.0", "id": "hxwbljp", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_sy3t8e", "parent_id": "t1_hxw9xfk", "score": "28", "subreddit": "antipornography", "subreddit_id": "t5_38sep"}, {"author": "AbsentFuck", "body": "take my poor reddit award: \ud83c\udfc6", "created_utc": "1645485929.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hxw98oj", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_swqppu", "parent_id": "t1_hxus7ni", "score": "3", "subreddit": "detrans", "subreddit_id": "t5_3pyg0"}, {"author": "AbsentFuck", "body": "Amber is what I like to call the last masc standing haha.

There are mixed findings at best from the research we do have on casual sex, but this in particular should be of note from this article (studies linked within) https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-the-impact-of-casual-sex-on-mental-health-5179455#:~:text=6%EF%BB%BF%20Some%20studies%20have,%2C%20and%20poor%20self%2Desteem.:\n\n>researchers note that beneficial mental health impacts are not universal and that factors like using alcohol, not knowing one's partner, and not being sexually satisfied from the encounter can make a negative emotional response more likely.\n\nLet's emphasize \"not knowing one's partner\" and \"not being sexually satisfied\" being linked to more negative emotional responses. Most people in porn do not know each other. Most straight men couldn't get a woman anywhere near an orgasm with a gun to their heads.

It's legal and \"safe\" in moderation, but even at those safe levels it has no nutritional value, slows down your impulses and impairs people's ability to make decisions. Consuming and participating in pornography have a mountain of negative effects.

You're overcomplicating this. You can live outside of those boundaries without transitioning.\n\n>although if i had to pick between the two, \n\nYou do not have to pick. You can live your life in any way that feels comfortable to you. You are not stuck with choosing among stereotypes presented by society.\n\n>i almost want to take testosterone to make up for how feminine people percive me as. doesnt matter how short i cut my hair or how masculine of clothes i wear, the way people perceive me is obvious. a feminine, innocent, delicate little thing\n\nIt's always interesting to me when I hear trans people say being trans is innate, yet they say things very similar to this. That their dysphoria and self perception is greatly (or entirely) influenced by how other people see them. \n\nAnyway, this screams internalized misogyny to me. If I were you I'd try to unpack whether you simply dislike the way society tries to shove women into the \"feminine, innocent, delicate\" box (totally okay, and I feel the same), or if you think there is something inherently wrong with being those things (not okay).\n\nIf it's the former, then that's fine. You can live your life as a very androgynous woman. You can even go back on testosterone if you want, as long as you are aware of the risks and you are aware that you have no control over how testosterone will change your body. You say you don't think it will turn you into a hairy beast, but you don't know that. You don't know how much it will deepen your voice, how much more body hair it will give you, or what you will look like when it redistributes your body fat. \n\nI see a lot of dysphoric girls like you who aspire to be soft femboys, get on testosterone, and are heartbroken when it makes them look like men. Hairy, bearded, balding men with beer guts. \n\nThere are obviously things testosterone can't change. It can't make you taller. It can't give you a more androgynous skeleton (although it can give the illusion of broader shoulders and a squarer chin through increased muscle mass and a different fat distribution).\n\nHonestly from reading the rest of your comments the biggest red flag to me is this:\n\n>i want to be a transman, not a \"normal woman\".\n\nThese are not your only options. The fact that you think they are means you haven't truly explored what it means to be free from societal expectations of gender. Transitioning would mean surrendering. It would be saying \"you're right society, I can't be myself and see myself as a woman at the same time.\"\n\n>doesnt matter how short i cut my hair or how masculine of clothes i wear\n\nHow hard have you tried? How short have you cut your hair? Are we talking a pixie cut? If so, go further. Shave part of it. Have you done that? If so, go further. Shave all of it.\n\nHow masculine are we talking as far as clothing goes? A hoodie and sweatpants? Go further. A men's t-shirt and jeans? Go further. Tims, men's cargo pants and a button up from the men's section? Now we're getting somewhere.\n\nYou can even go further than that. Wear men's deodorant and cologne if you really wanna push those boundaries.\n\nI say all of this because my body is about as dainty and feminine as you can imagine. 5 foot nothing, full lips, very big eyes (multiple people have told me how big they are), thick eyelashes, extremely petite (I'm almost 30 and I can still fit in clothes from the little girls' section at most stores), c-cup breasts, no chin to speak of. And guess what?\n\nA woman called me 'sir' the other day. I've never been on hormones.\n\nAnother instance a worker at Disney world called every woman ahead of me 'miss' or 'ma'am'. When I stepped up to the counter she didn't know what to call me. The confusion on her face was hilarious.\n\nIf you tell yourself you need testosterone in order to look androgynous, you are lying. You've already lost because you've already shot yourself in the foot. You can't win if you don't try. So try, and try *hard*.\n\nI used to think exactly like you. That I could never be as masculine presenting as I wanted unless I got on hormones because of how naturally girly I looked. That was a lie. Turns out, I hadn't tried hard enough.\n\nEdit: also, don't underestimate how much your attitude and the way you carry yourself can impact how people see you.

There was a distinct time in my childhood where I rejected anything girly or feminine. Femininity was always associated with weakness and inferiority. What strong willed girl wants to be those things? Once I tried transitioning and it wasn't helping me I had to really examine why I was trying so hard to escape being female. And I realized being a girl isn't being weak or less than. It's society's perception of women that's fucked. When I started to see all the subtle ways sexism seeps into our lives (like the male default phenomenon for example) I realized this was not a problem with me.\n\nI found power in my femaleness through that realization.\n\n- Realizing my dislike of being female didn't make me special.\n\nSeriously. Talk to any girl or woman and she'll bring up something she dislikes about being female. The fact that I was obsessing over it didn't mean I was special, it meant I had anxiety and a tendency to fixate on things other people didn't.\n\n- Realizing that my womanhood isn't contingent on performing femininity.\n\nI am still just as much of a woman regardless of how I dress, act, sound, or look. That was very comforting to me. I was not less of a woman or more of a man just because I rejected certain female stereotypes. \n\n-  Realizing femaleness is not an identity. It is a reality.\n\nI cannot opt out of being short or black. My femaleness is just as fundamental as me being short or black. Womanhood is not a costume I can take off when I get tired of it. I can bleach my skin if I want, but my ancestry will always be African. I can wear heels or put lifts in my shoes but at the end of the day when I take that stuff off I'm still short. Being female was no different.\n\n- I was greedy.\n\nMeaning, no amount of surgery or testosterone was going to give me a dick and balls and actually make me male. So why go through the trouble of fighting a losing battle? Why settle for an approximation when I wanted the real deal?\n\n- I enjoy giving society the finger.\n\nI love seeing the look on people's faces when they assume I'm trans or non-binary and I tell them no I'm a woman. I don't \"identify\" as a woman, I just am. I can see them short circuting when they see my men's clothes and shaved head. 'You can't possibly be comfortable being a woman dressed like that!' Well I am. That feeling is a lot of fun. And it sure as hell beats sulking for 2 weeks because someone called me \"she\".\n\nEdit: I also wanted to add that being trans was just tiring.

They'll say they do, but there's always some caveat like she can be \"masculine\" but needs to still have long hair, big boobs, needs to shave, etc.\n\nI couldn't relate to anyone it seemed like. Straight girls who were tomboys always grew up to embrace femininity in a way I just couldn't. And everyone else who was GNC was either gay or bi with a strong same sex preference. Where are all the straight women who are masculine? Where are the bi women with a strong male preference who are masculine? Starting to think they only exist in spaces like this because I see them literally nowhere else. When I come across a woman who claims to be both straight and masculine and I see what she looks like, it's always just. She doesn't have makeup on. And she likes wearing hoodies.....like, okay??

This helped me to use new words I learned and solidify their meanings. It also gave me incentive to look up new words and grammar points when I wanted to write something, but wasn't sure how to say it in Korean.\n* Learning grammar before focusing on vocab. With Korean I realized that for me, I learned a lot more when I learned a lot of grammar, then sort of \"filled in the blanks\" with vocab.\n* Studying Hanja. I know it's not a \"requirement\" to know Hanja as a Korean learner, but it's been really helpful for me to learn new words if I know they share a Hanja root. Like the root '\uc2ec' in the words '\uc5f4\uc2ec\ud788', '\uad00\uc2ec', and '\uacb0\uc2ec'. It helped cement their meanings in my mind to know that they all share this \"heart/soul\" root.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>\u00b7 What kind of materials are easy or difficult to find?\n\nDifficult:\n\n* Finding native speakers to practice with.
