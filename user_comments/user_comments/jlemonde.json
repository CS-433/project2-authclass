But flashcards aren't an optimal implementation of spaced repetition, although the algorithm is very optimised. If you try to learn from a pre-made deck or from a whole list of vocab from a book, there will indeed be many words that you either don't yet need or aren't ready to learn, and you won't feel urged to learn them so it will be extra difficult for you at that moment. And the effort to learn words that aren't momentarily useful is perhaps not worth it. \n\nIf you choose to use flashcards, you have got to choose which words to add to your deck and build it by yourself. You can use a vocab list to populate your deck, but don't hesitate to skip learning all the words that feel too difficult. You could for example highlight the words you already imported and come back after a few months for a second run and add the more complicated ones. You can even do three or more runs over each list.\n\nSadly, rote memorisation is essential in the beginning, but the more proficient you become, the more alternatives you get. For instance, reading is also a form of spaced repetition!\n\nIn fact, I can give you an advice for when it comes to reading: use a pencil and highlight the interesting words, but keep reading. As long as you understand roughly what you read, skip the complicated words, unless they look interesting. Then later (e.g. after your reading session or before the next) you can go back to those interesting words. The magic occurs in the fact that after a while you will recognise more and more words even without looking them up since the simple process of highlighting them will bring them up in your consciousness, and thanks to the 'confirmation bias' (which is in this case a positive phenomenon) you will recognise them in all the subsequent occurrences and end up understanding them over the weeks as you will subconsciously build a strong corpus of examples for each of those words: you will have learnt how to use them without even looking them up.

That makes from a dozen to a hundred new expressions per chapter, which you may limit yourself to only highlight and reread once or twice after a while (you needn't translate them).

Many words that would be unknown to you may be useless words that only give nuances that aren't required to your comprehension. Eventually, they will remind you of something and you would learn them in another iteration.\n\nIn a nutshell: the important thing is that you manage to keep reading, and while doing so, notice how the words you are not confident about are use in context.

So double/simple consonants only serve the purpose of indicating the length of the vowel that comes before. The amount of consonants has btw been revised for many words to match the preceding vowel's length. It is only in few words that a same vowel (usually 'a') is written twice (e.g. Haar), for historical reasons. But sure, this possibly means that historically it may have been a thing to write a same vowel twice if it was long, but I rather think it was historically a diphthong between two distinct vowels which both were represented by 'a'.

Unfortunately it is not published, but I can still show you if you want. I am currently developing a new version aimed at being published. \n\nMy algorithm works as follows: given four feedback buttons with initial intervals '8 days', '2 days', '4 hours', '5 minutes', I store for each flashcard a learnFactor that will multiply the initial intervals according to how well I know the flashcard. The four feedback buttons would not only disable the cards for a given amount of time, but also multiply their respective learnFactor by 2, 1.2, sqrt(1/2) and 1/2 respectively. \n\nIf you find a way to evaluate an algorithm, let me know! I wanted to do that in order to adjust the weights of my algorithm, but I was never able to find a decent solution... But given I have learnt 6'000 words of Spanish and 4'000 words of Swedish with my SRS, I guess the algorithm works for me!\n\nAlso, i had tackled the issue in which too many words are due for review by simply shifting the due dates in time by an equivalent amount of days to the duration you did not revise.

B2). \n\nHowever, from my experience I would say that it is reasonable to aim for a new language every two to three years, at least if the languages are somewhat related to something you already speak and provide clear learning materials and sufficient contents such as books, movies, music, TV, radio, ... immersion is of course also a solution but every one can't necessarily afford it. The point is that you could be proficient in five languages (4 TLs and 1 NL) after ten years, without dedicating more than an hour a day. \n\nLearning additional highly related languages might appear faster, but comes with a risk of confusion sometimes referred to as linguistic interference. Overcoming these interferences seems to me about as difficult to achieve as learning an unrelated language, so I argue that learning a very closely related language only helps in starting faster, not in mastering it faster. However the experience of training your mind to learn new languages will indeed help you learn the next languages faster, but regardless of if they are related languages or not. So the optimum would be to learn somewhat-but-not-too-closely related languages mostly. \n\nTo the maintainance part: I think that once you reach a comfortable proficiency (B2/C1), you won't forget much on the long term. Of course your active vocabulary could decrease quite a bit, but by simply using the language a few times in a month you could last for years without endangering your level much; then recovering your level could take as little as a few days of active effort if needed. So a good practice would be to have only one language you actively learn, and several that you don't focus on, but occasionally use.\n\nUnder these assumptions, *I am confident that someone could reach B2/C1-proficiency in a dozen of languages and maintain them all*. But this would be a lifetime commitment (I am only extrapolating what I have already achieved over a longer span of years).

Max 5 or so per page, while there would be over 30 that I could want to learn better. And I don't look them up immediately (unless really required to understand the plot), but after 3 to 5 days or so because I have noticed that after that time I would have guessed the meaning of about 1/3 of those words subconsciously and actually learnt them automatically, so I don't need to look them up anymore and thus gain some precious time. If I again discard looking them up, but only reread the list (only looking up those I don't remember at all), then there is a likelihood that I will further get familiarised with some more words, especially if those words come back while I am reading the book. \n (If someone knows whether this whole phenomena is documented I would be glad to hear it! I really use it a lot and would love to know how to use it better \u2013 beware that this way you only learn words that you already guess a bit from the context, though, but you can still go from slightly guessing to being sure about the meaning of a word without ever reading a definition or translation). \n\nMy method lacks speaking with natives. While I pay special attention to pronunciation, I don't have plenty of opportunities to speak with people and train speaking.

Thus the phrases are not written down but still play a role. \n\nNote types and card sides: as I actually don't use Anki I can't relate, but I don't use clozes.

But I am completely able to build sentences directly in my TL from day one, I never translate in my head before speaking. I think what helps me there is that I don't try to link my native word to the TL word on the flashcard but instead I always try to visualise the concept before flipping the card. \n\nTarget language: At some point I also create decks where the front side of the cards is definitions directly in my TL and I have to guess the TL word. These are the cards I like the most, but I do very few of them because it is difficult to select good and short definitions, and you need to understand the definitions on the first place. \n\nAre my cards personal? Yes, a lot, and not really.
