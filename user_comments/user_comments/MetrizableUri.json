According to whom, you? Since when did you become the sole arbiter of morality?\n\nIt's wrong because you unnecessarily harm a sentient creature.\n\n>On the contrary, what is immoral is condemning people and subjecting them to your standard of morality and ethics (religion basically), why is your brand of morality the only correct one?\n\nLet me understand: you think that the moral question \"is it wrong to eat meat\" is subjective, so it is OBJECTIVELY immoral for me for commenting about my moral views. Decide, either morality is subjective or it's objective.\n\n>Most vegans are usually upper middle class, those who can actually afford a vegan diet and take supplements.\n\n[This is simply wrong.](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/animals-and-us/201508/vegetarianism-and-money-surprising-results-new-study) And about the supplements I have no idea what makes you think that they are expensive, especially with the rise of meat and dairy prices. Also you only have to take b12 supplements, and even that can be obtained by fortified food.\n\n>Kwashiorkor is basically a severe form of malnoutrition where the body severely lacks protein. You know those poor African children with enlarged stomachs and protruding ribs? Yeah, they have kwashiorkor. You know what their diet mostly consists? Potatoes, cassava, rice and corn. Sure, they have beans which is a good source of plant protein but that doesn't stop them from developing kwashiorkor.\n\nIn case you aren't aware, we are not hungry kids in Africa and we have enough plant based protein so that we don't have to eat meat to survive.\n\n>Aside from B12, vegans also have to worry about their protein intake. A well planned vegan diet isn't even affordable to a lot of people and most are usually imported. The fact that you have to carefully plan your diet is just absurd. Unless you're an actor, athlete, model or whatever who have to be strict with their diets.\n\nYou're saying it like everyone who eats meat has a perfect diet. The number 1 cause of death is heart diseases which are linked to eating too much meat. The US is one of the countries that consumes the most meat per capita and it has one of the highest obesity rates in the world.\n\nYou don't have to plan every meal in a vegan diet you just need to make sure that you eat protein and iron.\n\nAbout the affordability - you can buy beans, peas, soybeans and nuts which have a lot of protein and iron and they are very cheap (especially with the rise or meat prices, as I said before).\n\n>Like I previously mentioned, vegan diets are not healthy. A vegan couple killed their own baby by feeding them solely fruits and vegetables. Do you consider that moral?\n\nThey killed the baby because the fed them *solely fruits and vegetables*. There is vegan protein.\n\n>Tons of cats and dogs also died from being fed a vegan diet. Do you consider that moral? If eating meat is immoral, then is feeding your pet meat also immoral? But surely purposefully starving animals is considered immoral.\n\nThis specifically is something I agree with you. But you are not a cat so this argument has nothing to do with *your* diet.\n\n>You vegans usually speak from a position of privilege.\n\nWe speak from a position of privilege? You literally think that your temporary pleasure is worth torturing animals.\n\nAnd don't tell me that you only eat meat because it's healthy. Nobody eats hot dogs KFC and big macs because they want to be healthy.\n\n>I doubt you vegans even know anything about morality. Maybe you should attend an ethics and philosophy class before engaging in any type of discussions about morality. You lack rationality and common sense, you spout whatever is told sithout critically thinking or questioning your information. I doubt you've even thought about the possible negative effects of a fully vegan diet.\n\nAbout 8% of philosophy sutends and teachers in the university of Chicago are vegan and about 25% are vegetarian ([source](https://themoralperspective.com/2012/10/10/survey-registers-philosophers-eating-habits/)).
