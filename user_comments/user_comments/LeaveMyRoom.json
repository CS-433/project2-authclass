[{"author": "LeaveMyRoom", "body": "Doesn't end well for you. Here are two scenarios I've experienced in my life.\n\n1. Spent 2 years with a girl and never looked through her phone. She started hanging out with some male friends more frequently and texting them more. I finally hit my breaking point where I just needed to know.\n\nSo I looked through her phone and found her sexting a guy. Talking about how she missed his dick, calling him daddy, etc etc. Turned out she had cheated on me with at least 6 different guys.\n\n2. Also spent 2 years with this next girl. She had male friends that she hung out with, some of which I wasn't comfortable with. I eventually broke up with her, and within a few weeks she had sex with every single guy she told me not to worry about. Never cheated on me during the relationship, and I don't think she ever would have even if it continued. But I found out there had been flirting between them going on while we dated.\n\n_________\n\nI'm not okay with that. So I have a new rule, and that's no 1on1's. You can have friends of the opposite gender, idc who it is, how hot he is, how horny/sexual he is; it's all fine. So long as there are no 1on1's between them.\n\nThere's really no reason for people to have close friends of the opposite gender.", "created_utc": "1666079931.0", "edited": "False", "id": "iss153z", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_y6ri02", "parent_id": "t3_y6ri02", "score": "2", "subreddit": "ask", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhlj"}, {"author": "LeaveMyRoom", "body": "what do you use the virtual desktops for?", "created_utc": "1666076953.0", "edited": "False", "id": "isrxscu", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_um7zzr", "parent_id": "t1_i8608v8", "score": "1", "subreddit": "buildapc", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rnve"}, {"author": "LeaveMyRoom", "body": "!!!!\n\nThank you so much; I didn't even realize MainActivity was a class declaration.

I didn't speak a word of Spanish when I got here. (Okay, I knew si, hola, and bueno). I haven't really studied much at all. I did a little YouTube tutorial series after being frustrated at my lack of understanding. It helped a lot and it was approximately 3 hours long. (And the majority of the time was spent just using the few words it showed you in different sentences and having you repeat it. So it was honestly very little content. I can assure you this was an extremely small part of my learning process)\n\nAfter this I got a Mexican who understood English but couldn't speak it. I would speak in English and she would speak in Spanish. I spent 7 hours a day, 3-4 days a week with her. This is where I learned nearly all of my Spanish. I have reached a B1 level and am still progressing. It has taken me almost 10 months. I still see her every week, and on top of our visits, we now frequently voice call on the days we do not meet.\n\nIt was very difficult at first, but she would speak extremely slowly, we would use the translator when it was necessary, and eventually I started remembering the words and learning to form sentences. I now speak to her in Spanish about 50% of the time.\n\nAside from this I also watched TV (with subtitles) about 1h per day, and used a flashcard app for 20 minutes once per week. (Really not much time at all). I have never taken any classes, or watched any more tutorials. I have never studied grammar. I just talk to natives.\n\nI would consider myself to more or less have learned from immersion. So it is definitely possible. \n\n- I would say my listening comprehension is very good. I understand the majority of what people say, regardless of how fast they say it (Depending on the topic). \n- My speaking on the other hand is fairly poor/average. (I only started speaking about a month ago, actually. Before this it felt like a struggle and there wasn't much point.) I can express myself, but it can sometimes take me a while to properly form my sentences. Simple sentences on the other hand just flow out.\n- My conjugations are lacking; I definitely struggle with some of the tenses. This is something I should probably research and practice.\n- My grammar seems to be good/average. I have a feel for the order the words should be in. I still make mistakes though.\n- My vocabulary is fairly average for my ability level.\n- Reading comprehension? I don't really have anyone else to compare it with, but it's equal to my listening comprehension I'd say. It's neither harder nor easier.\n\nI have surpassed the other English speakers that had already lived here for a year or two that study frequently. When I first got here, I thought their Spanish was amazing, and it would take forever for me to reach that level. Now I look at them and think their Spanish is abysmal. I frequently need to correct them and clear things up with the Mexicans they're speaking to so there aren't any miscommunications. \n\nI certainly believe if I actually studied, or put any real effort into learning the language I would be very far ahead of where I am now. But even the ones who know more about grammar, rules, and have a more expansive vocabulary than I, still struggle when it comes to actually interacting with natives.
