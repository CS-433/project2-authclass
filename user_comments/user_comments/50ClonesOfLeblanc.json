I personally use Busuu, and I use it especially when I'm busy or when I don't really feel like studying german for a long time, but still wanna keep the language \"flowing\" in my brain, if that makes any sense.\n\n\\- With that being said, you should look for a portuguese grammar book and try to do one or two exercises at least a day, of course it's hard to be consistent with that (as I said, sometimes you just don't feel like studying it, and that's completely fine! language learning should be fun, not a chore).\n\n\\- Listen to music and try to sing it! Music is a very efficient way to memorise vocabulary (repetition, repetition, repetition and more repetition).\n\n\\- Watch youtube videos and podcasts made especifically for beginners.\n\n\\- Write a diary in portuguese! You can look up as many words as you want, but writing a diary everyday makes it so you're consistenly getting new information about the language and learning a lot of everyday stuff.\n\n\\- Change your apps and videogames to portuguese.

LeBlanc uses this skill for 3 things in lane: 1- Clear the wave, 2- Deal damage, 3- Dodge skills. When she does one of those 3 things, punish her on the other 2. If she uses it to clear the wave, poke her, she has no sustain outside of corrupting potion.\n\n2- Respect her, but don't be super afraid of her\n\nThis may sound contradicting, but what I mean is: respect her power spikes (mainly levels 2, 3 and 6), but remember, if she used her entire combo on you, and dealt, let's say, 60% of your hp, if you know the enemy jungler is not nearby, fight her back! Her cooldowns are big, punish her for overextending, obviously, don't go too ham, but if she uses her skills on you, don't simply run away.\n\n3- Take every defensive option you can in the early game\n\nLeBlanc is 100% reliant on snowballing. Almost every champion in the game outscales her. What this means is: you win by not losing. Therefore you should use every defensive option that is available to you, such as Bone Plating, Banshee's, Hexdrinker, the list goes on.\n\nI'll also give you some checks/counters to LeBlanc:\n\nMorgana - This one is a classic, AFK push the wave and LeBlanc will have very little things to do, her wave clear is awful, so Morgana can perma push her. Also, insta Q if LeBlanc dashes on you, and don't instantly use your black shield, as LeBlanc can destroy it before breaking the tether, only use it for the tether root.\n\nLux - Many people tell me Lux sucks against LeBlanc, but when my enemy picks LeBlanc, I instantly pick Lux, I find this match up to be very easy. You can fight LeBlanc lvls 1-2-3 really easily. You should take Bone Plating to help you tank her combo (with your shield), also take Barrier. If things are not going well, get a Banshee's.\n\nLulu - Oh. My. God.

"50ClonesOfLeblanc", "body": "> If she uses Distortion to wave clear, she will just keep your distance not allowing you to poke her at all \n\nUhm, after LeBlanc uses Distortion she has 0 mobility outside of her ult, if she even has it up, and every champion nowadays has some type of gapcloser or a long range ability, so there are indeed ways of poking her.\n\n> You can waveclear back, but in that case nothing really happens \n\nThat's a really wrong way of thinking, pushing LeBlanc into tower will mean that she will have to use her skills to farm, due to her base AD and auto attack animation being awful, therefore you will have even more room to poke her (be careful about jungler tho).\n\n> How do you exactly \"fight back\" \n\nLeBlanc's combo is EXTREMELY telegraphed, it may not seem like it, but to cast a Q-W-E she needs to keep herself in an agressive area for a fairly big ammount of time, that is, enough time to get hit by at least 2 skills from an enemy. The ult combos, outside of the ones using Mimic: Distortion (which deals less damage) also take a lot of time to cast due to Q and E (and the copies)' cast time.\n\n> We've seen 0/3 LeBlancs blowing up people with a single spell rotation, both in SoloQ games and at a competitive level \n\nThose instances are really rare. Saying LeBlanc has a good scaling is as wrong as saying Pantheon has a good scaling. A good LeBlanc may find her way of being useful (like in pro play) but your average LeBlanc player won't. If LeBlanc is behind, and specially if you get defensive items, she will be dead weight.\n\nAnd yes, it's true that her roaming is amazing, but she can't roam if you push the wave, keeping it under her tower... and this comes back to the first point...\n\nAnd just to add something here, Distortion has a small, yet significant snapback delay, so you are not as unsafe under tower as you think you are, since LeBlanc will at least take 1 turret shot from using, let's say, a Q-W under your tower, and you CAN hit her with at least 2 skills while she casts this combo, again, it's extremely telegraphed", "created_utc": "1541897672.0", "edited": "False", "id": "e9gdm87", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_9vw4mt", "parent_id": "t1_e9fqsgl", "score": "1", "subreddit": "leagueoflegends", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rfxx"}, {"author": "50ClonesOfLeblanc", "body": "I have to disagree on Kassadin, I play LeBlanc and (not even joking) find Kassadin to be one of the easiest match ups, bait his Q with an auto, and only use your combo after it.", "created_utc": "1541874056.0", "edited": "False", "id": "e9fkys1", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_9vw4mt", "parent_id": "t1_e9fhnwl", "score": "-3", "subreddit": "leagueoflegends", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rfxx"}, {"author": "50ClonesOfLeblanc", "body": "Hello! I'm a LeBlanc main, and I understand why you struggle against her,\nI can't deny she is pretty strong right now, but she isn't really unconterable, so here are some tips I got from playing so many LeBlanc games.\n\n1- Work your way around distortion\n\n As you said, almost every LeBlanc maxes W first now, what that means is that all of her power will be stored into this single skill (in laning phase, that is). LeBlanc uses this skill for 3 things in lane: 1- Clear the wave, 2- Deal damage, 3- Dodge skills.\n When she does one of those 3 things, punish her on the other 2. If she uses it to clear the wave, poke her, she has no sustain outside of corrupting potion.\n\n2- Respect her, but don't be super afraid of her\n\n This may sound contradicting, but what I mean is: respect her power spikes (mainly levels 2, 3 and 6), but remember, if she used her entire combo on you, and dealt, let's say, 60% of your hp, if you know the enemy jungler is not nearby, fight her back! Her cooldowns are big, punish her for overextending, obviously, don't go too ham, but if she uses her skills on you, don't simply run away.\n\n3- Take every defensive option you can in the early game\n\n LeBlanc is 100% reliant on snowballing. Almost every champion in the game outscales her. What this means is: you win by not losing. Therefore you should use every defensive option that is available to you, such as Bone Plating, Banshee's, Hexdrinker, the list goes on.\n\nI'll also give you some checks/counters to LeBlanc:\n\n Akali - IMO the hardest LeBlanc counter, and also IMO the only champion that can be really called a counter. On every other match up LeBlanc can always work her away around and do something to win, but against Akali I haven't found anything I could really do. Her shroud is amazing to bully LeBlanc, and you can always do Hexdrinker.\n\n Morgana - This one is a classic, AFK push the wave and LeBlanc will have very little things to do, her wave clear is awful, so Morgana can perma push her. Also, insta Q if LeBlanc dashes on you, and don't instantly use your black shield, as LeBlanc can destroy it before breaking the tether, only use it for the tether root.\n\n Lux - Many people tell me Lux sucks against LeBlanc, but when my enemy picks LeBlanc, I instantly pick Lux, I find this match up to be very easy. You can fight LeBlanc lvls 1-2-3 really easily. You should take Bone Plating to help you tank her combo (with your shield), also take Barrier.

Another thing I would love Karma to have ~~is her fans~~ is the duality between Normal skills vs Mantra'd skills, that being said, I HATE current Mantra Q and Mantra E, Imo, Mantra Q should have some defensive aspect on it, and Mantra E... you know ;\\_; ... shield bomb.\n\nAnother thing I love about the current iteration of Karma is how kite-reliant she is, this is very uncommon in a mage of Karma's style, but to play Karma you HAVE to kite, and I love that so much about her!\n\nI'd also love her W to have an ally iteration.\n\nAlso, I'd suggest removing the AOE shield, leaving damage for mantra E, and peel for mantra Q (duality).

That is a balance nightmare. A Marskman/Assassin hybrid CAN'T have an on-hit passive, as it forces them into Attack-Speed builds, and, as we all know, Attack-Speed builds will push her into the DPS role, instead of the burst side of an Assassin. At the same time, she can still burst you WITH A DPS (ON-HIT) FOCUSED BUILD! That's mind blowing for me. Her ultimate also proves to be a problem to me. The shield, in my opinion, is problematic, specially when used to kite opponents (and many people do that), it is also annoying when she uses that to flank and gets a huge shield while kills the entire team, but that's, honestly, understandable, but that's not understandable for kiting! :( Imo her shield should scale with the distance from her ultimate. Not only that, but her Q is a really weird and simple,  yet no counterplay, ability. Her evolution system is REALLY cool, but once people figured out the right build to get the 3 evolutions, it became annoying and not really fun, Imo she should be restricted to 1 evolution, but each of them would be way more niche AND way stronger.

If you notice, during the last 7 years (other than some metas like mordekaiser adc but w/e), there are metas where you don't see an assassin on each team, a mage on each team, a bruiser on each team (they appear more often cuz they're large, but w/e), a tank on each team, an enchanter on each team, WHY DO WE NEED A MARSKMAN ON EACH TEAM? WHY CAN'T MARSKMAN BE OUT OF META FOR (SOME) PATCHES, and remember, it's not EVERY marskman that is out of meta, the crit ones are bad, yes, but the on\\-hit/early game ones are still very good! You guys are overreacting so hard.\n\nAnd yes, I think bruiser bot works (I've been testing it myself and oh shit is it fun), but it's not like it absolutely DESTROYS marskman, they're niches, every champion should have a niche, and not be similar to the others.\n\nMeta changes, Adc/supp has been really strong during this season (and half of s7), while most of the assassins where unviable (there were only some like kha zix who could work in some situations \u00abor leclunck, if you considered her an assassin\u00bb) now assassins are back into the game, the meta shifts! that's how things work... adapt...

Like, you know on the horror films the guy that appears from nothing with a pale and terrifying face and would insta kill you? That's how i always saw Leblanc.\n\nHer old passive was LITERALLY Leblanc, when she is in trouble, she will do some weird magic trick and leave like nothing happened, Leclunck would create the clone WHILE she is on the strong side (bursting someone), in most of the situations, it would not be worth it, because she would kill anyway - Leblanc would never do that, she's smart enough to know that she wouldn't need it, so she wouldn't waste it that, and would wait for the perfect time (when she is in trouble).\n\nAlso, what I said above about the clones... In a gameplay prespective having the clone on ult absolutely killed the idea of counterplay they \"tried\" to implement on her. if you use W-RQ (wait  a bit) and Q, they wouldn't have counterplay other than flash anyway, because you were stealthed and with a clone.\n\nAgain, to Leblanc's theme, there are 2 ways of looking at it, one favours Leblanc, and other favours Leclunck.\n\nThe one that favours Leclunck:\n\nShe pretends that she will let the enemy leave for 1.5 seconds, but after that time she will kill them anyway and they will feel so bad because they thought they could leave, but they got shitted on #nomercy.\n\nThe one that favours LeBlanc:\n\nAs said above, Leblanc is smart, she would never wait 1.5 seconds to kill someone, why would she waste time? Why would she take risks? Everyone knows that on films and stuff, when a villain pretends they're gonna let you leave, YOU ALWAYS FIND A WAY TO LEAVE, because the villain starts talking to you and doesn't notice you're leaving - in game that is described by Janna and Lulu : ^)\n\nFrom a gameplay prespective, Leblanc's clone is far superior to Leclunck's, specially for the player, it feels more rewarding.\n\nLeclunck's clones don't feel satisfying for some reasons, first:\n\n  The clone you spawn after using RQ/W/E barely existed, in fact, everything it did was sometimes making the enemy exhaust/ignite/ult you, but, honestly, that didn't feel rewarding as it was enemies fault and not something you did, you could indeed control it, but it lasted like 1 second so you didn'r really do anything.\n\n   While Shadow of the Rose was rarely used for being a deceiving tool, most of the times you used it to block skill shots/caitlyn ult or to tank miniom waves. The only situation (I) used it to deceive really was when my bot/top lane was getting ganked and I used it to pretend I was going to help, so they would run from me. In the first months it was actually used for deceiving since nobody knew what she did, so they would Flash, ult etc... after that it was really rare, and when it happened, it was the \"haha\" moment that wasn't really satisfying imo.\n\nNow when it comes to Leblanc clone:\n\n   You don't control when it pops, like you do with Leclunck's clones, but you control everything he does, you can use the taunt/dance/joke animation on it.\n\n   When you get ganked and you get low, you can simply stand still and put your clone running to the tower - THAT is deceiving, you do it by your own skill, not by 50/50 situations.\n\n   Today I was playing Leblanc vs Ryze, I was medium hp and my own jungler ganked me, ryze proced my passive, I knew he would try to kill me. What did I do? I stood still and put my clone dodging his skill shots, a clone wouldn't do that by himself, so he 100% thought it was me - Then he used all his combo on it, killed it, but then my jungler killed him, as he had no cooldowns to use, I was still alive - THAT is deceiving.\n\nThere's so much more I can say about that, but the text is already huge and my hands are already dying ._.", "created_utc": "1524661113.0", "edited": "False", "id": "dxxud9g", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_8es9e8", "parent_id": "t1_dxxqqns", "score": "4", "subreddit": "LeBlancMains", "subreddit_id": "t5_35bez"}, {"author": "50ClonesOfLeblanc", "body": "That's the thing, Leblanc and LeClunck are 2 different champions, it's almost impossible for a Leblanc Main (like me) to 100% enjoy Leclunck, and it's almost impossible for a Leclunck main to 100% enjoy Leblanc, they are 2 absolutely different champs.\n\nLeblanc is arguably the fastest champion in the game, with huge burst .\n\nLeclunck is probably the best champion for gank set ups, arguably the control mage with the biggest mobility, with the best split push and sustain.
