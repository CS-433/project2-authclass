What matters is the effect it had on you. \n\nMy story is not quite the same, but I know people in your position. My dad is autistic and has a lot of emotional trauma from his parents immaturity. My mom has a lot of emotional trauma as well. They both had me for na\u00efve reasons and taught me a lot of emotionally damaging lessons through my childhood, never deliberately. I try not to be angry at them or blame them, but at the end of the day I still have all this emotional baggage from being parentified and neglected, and that\u2019s the important part to acknowledge and deal with. \n\n\u201cJustified\u201d doesn\u2019t really enter my reasoning. I learned X, Y, and Z lessons during my childhood, and I need to learn healthier lessons that work better as an independent adult. Thinking about whether I can blame two people who don\u2019t exist anymore (they\u2019re still alive, but this happened 30 years ago) is a waste of effort.

After the R\u00f6hm purge in 1934, persecuting homosexuals became a priority of the Nazi police state. A 1935 revision of Paragraph 175 made it easier to bring criminal charges for homosexual acts, leading to a large increase in arrests and convictions.\n\n>The Nazi regime considered the elimination of all manifestations of homosexuality in Germany one of its goals. Men were often arrested after denunciation, police raids, and through information uncovered during interrogations of other homosexuals. Those arrested were presumed guilty, and subjected to harsh interrogation and torture to elicit a confession. Between 1933 and 1945, an estimated 100,000 men were arrested as homosexuals; around 50,000 of these were sentenced by civilian courts, 6,400 to 7,000 by military courts [de], and an unknown number by special courts. Most of these men served time in regular prisons, and between 5,000 and 6,000 were imprisoned in Nazi concentration camps. The death rate of these prisoners has been estimated at 60 percent, a higher rate than those of other prisoner groups. A smaller number of men were sentenced to death or executed at Nazi euthanasia centers. Nazi Germany's persecution of homosexuals is considered to be the most severe episode in a long history of discrimination and violence targeting sexual minorities.\n\n>After the war, homosexuals were initially not counted as victims of Nazism because homosexuality continued to be illegal in Nazi Germany's successor states.", "created_utc": "1664407197.0", "edited": "False", "id": "iqatdsv", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_xqo1l3", "parent_id": "t1_iqat2gz", "score": "28", "subreddit": "television", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh6e"}, {"author": "HoweverItHasToHappen", "body": "\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f theres dumbfucks everywhere.
