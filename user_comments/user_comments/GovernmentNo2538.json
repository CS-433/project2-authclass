In your first comment you used the term gun homicides throughout but then at one point said gun deaths which is why I wanted some clarification bc as you rightly said, most gun deaths in the USA are indeed suicides. \n\nYou also say that abortion would be illegal in an ideal society which is obviously very subjective. In my ideal society abortion wouldn't be necessary but that's not really possible unlike just making it illegal. It's also annoying most people who are against steps that actually prevent pregnancies such as sex ed in schools and easy access to contraceptives also tend to also be against abortion. This is a very general statement and I'm not saying it applies to you since idk much about your stances on these things. I'm just pointing out a general trend. \n\nBased on your beliefs I guess there's no downside done if an abortion ban doesn't work (expecting mothers could still die or be harmed from such a law but ig not in a way that counts as the law failing). I disagree but I guess I can at least respect the consistency since you also don't mention gun suicides in your argument . That said, an abortion ban does have downsides if it does work. If such a ban encourages some people to follow through with a pregnancy and care for their child then that's awesome. It will also result in people following through with pregnancies where more kids enter the foster system which is already terrible. It also leads to more kids growing up in poverty or unstable families. This is linked with higher crime rates, mental illness etc. Since you see abortion as murder i wouldnt be surprised if you don't see these as reason enough to allow abortions.

England is usually damp and they get a lot of rain. This means when it heats up that moisture is in the air. It means sweat can't evaporate as easily so they can't cool down as effectively as other places which are warmer and less humid.\n\n2 - Infrastructure. England does not reach 40\u00b0C regularly. In fact it hasn't at all in recorded history. Its usually much colder so their Infrastructure reflects that. They build house to trap heat, unlike say australia where things are built to keep cool. Also as you said air conditioning isn't really a thing in homes\n\n3 - They just arent used to it. I live in Scotland and have no issues with literally freezing temperatures whereas someone from a much warmer place who isn't used to that kind of temperature will suffer.\n\n4 - Behaviour. Without experiencing that kind of heat they aren't really well equipped to deal with it. In the uk when temperatures get hot, people go to the sun and drink alcohol.
