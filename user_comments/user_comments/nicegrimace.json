The Lawless French website is very good and somewhat more detailed.

For French only dictionaries, you can't beat Larousse, although Wiktionnaire is helpful for more obscure words and regionalisms.\n\nFor listening comprehension, Inner French is great. Once you're ready for native content, you can watch what you like, but closed captions (preferably not auto-generated) in French are the best at first. I watched a lot of documentaries on YouTube with terrible auto-generated CCs, which I guess forced me to listen very carefully, but I wouldn't recommend this to everyone. Once I got to the point where it was easier to understand without the CCs, I turned them off and stuck the audio on at 0.75 speed where necessary. If you have access to Netflix, the CCs on there are much better.\n\nWhen you are ready to watch things without any CCs or subs, the TV5Monde site has some good children's programmes as well as dramas, films and documentaries. I recommend starting with the children's programmes as you can't slow the audio down on that site.\n\nFor reading, I didn't use graded readers and started with comics (bandes dessin\u00e9es) instead. Then I read went on the French internet and read a lot of news, blogs, lifestyle sites, Wikipedia, etc. I still do that, but I also download books onto my Kindle and I read French poetry online. My advice there is just read whatever keeps your interest. If you want to read graded readers though, 'Short Stories in French' by Olly Richards is quite good.\n\nFor vocab, I just make my own lists because I hate using flashcards. People say flashcards are more efficient. I forget things and have to revise a lot, so they could be right. You could try Anki as the general consensus is that it's the best app for flashcards, although I could never get into it. I quite liked Memrise, although I think that's more for beginners.\n\nFor writing practise, Kwiziq is good. You have to pay to unlock most of it and the way the computer marks your work can be quite annoying (for example, the punctuation needs to be perfect) but the exercises are so good for practising grammar; it's almost like having a tutor.

I know it's going to be a tonne of work to get it to the same level as my French, and I'm far from done with French.\n\nI think about the following things to motivate me:\n\n1. I think I can reach A1 in German before I go to Austria in the winter. I've been to Germany before when I was speaking absolutely appalling German, so this time my holiday German will be a tiny bit less horrible. I could try and push myself to A2, but my target language is still French, and I don't think I'd have the time to get to A2 in German before the end of the year. But A1 is still something. \n\n2. I learned a tiny bit of German from family members as a child, so I am starting at about A0.3 rather than from absolute scratch. Plus I know a small amount of the vocabulary from listening to Rammstein, as silly as that sounds. I hate the \"absolute scratch\" part of learning languages, so any advantage is precious to me.\n\n3. It might take me 2 years or even longer to get to B1 in German, but once I'm there, I know I will be able to access so much media. Having reached the intermediate levels in one foreign language, I know I can do it in another.\n\n4. I think about how cool German sounds. Shallow, I know, but one of the reasons I stuck with French is because I enjoy the aesthetics of the language.\n\nThen after thinking about all this, trying to learn vocab and grammar seems like less of an horrendous chore.", "created_utc": "1660696978.0", "edited": "False", "id": "iklfk5k", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_wq5kz0", "parent_id": "t3_wq5kz0", "score": "5", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "nicegrimace", "body": "Drill noun gender and learn the phonetics more systematically", "created_utc": "1660657470.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ikio17u", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_wppaxe", "parent_id": "t3_wppaxe", "score": "5", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "nicegrimace", "body": "This has anglophone learning French energy.", "created_utc": "1660625487.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ikhcei7", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_wpfow6", "parent_id": "t1_ikgmoj4", "score": "3", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "nicegrimace", "body": "Bad comprehension means you will get the wrong end of the stick a lot.

That's why native speakers make so many errors when they have to write or speak formally, unless they practise doing those things often.\n\n>  I think speaking a language to the point where you can just hang out with your friend is not that hard because people will likely understand what you are saying even if your grammar is broken.\n\nExactly, and that's the level that most native speech is at most of the time. Part of the reason native speakers still study their own language in high school and beyond is to be able to produce writing *and* speech (think class discussions and debate club) in a more formal register where they can't rely on shortcuts and where their grammar needs to be more accurate. It's unnatural for them before they learn how to do it, and many never really learn how to produce their native language in different registers. Some people can't even speak without swearing; like they are literally incapable of not swearing when they speak because of the language habits they've adopted. People are very much creatures of habit.\n\nHow are you at thinking in English? Do you have an internal monologue (not everyone does) and if so, how complex are the phrases that come into your mind? I find that when I think in French, the phrases are not very complex at all because I haven't been able to think in that language for very long and I'm still at B1 level for most of the skills. One thing I've noticed though is that even my thoughts in English are mostly not in full sentences, especially if I haven't written anything or had an in-depth conversation for a while.\n\nTLDR: You're closer to a native-like skill level than you might think.

The list of subjunctive triggers in French is very long, but some of them are used far more commonly than others. Some of them are only used in formal writing, but some of them you hear often. The first one a lot of people learn is *'il faut que...'* (literally \"it is necessary that...\" but not that formal), then *'bien que...'* (although), *'avant que'* (before), *'pour que...'* (so that) and *'afin que'* (in order to).\n\nI find that the more I get used to these handful of triggers, the others become more natural to use. Perhaps this method would help with other Romance languages, though from what I understand, some of the other Romance languages have retained a more complex use of the subjunctive than French.\n\nIt helps that the subjunctive in modern French only uses two tenses (the present and the perfect).
