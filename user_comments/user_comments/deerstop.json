I'm from Russia, and we don't have any good skincare companies so I'm bound to order from abroad. There's just no point in ordering anything from the US, you guys are across the ocean. European products can be crazy expensive. (\u256f\u00b0\u76ca\u00b0)\u256f\u5f61\u253b\u2501\u253b Korea is close, cheaper and is just as good. Moreover Kbeauty is just so much fun! I like cute things and colourful packaging.

If you've read any book about body positivity, you probably know how deep runs our hatred of fat. Most people subconsciously associate fat with being lazy, stupid, spineless. They are also terrified of becoming this thing, because according to surveys a majority of people would rather lose a limb than be fat. Take it easy!
