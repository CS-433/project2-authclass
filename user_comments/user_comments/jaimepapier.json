[{"author": "jaimepapier", "body": ">\tEleven did casually insult people, and he was frequently secretive and manipulative.  I don\u2019t think an \u201cAm I a good man?\u201d arc would seem at all out of place for him.\n\nThat\u2019s why I said *in the way* 12 was. With 11 is passed off a bit \u201coops I\u2019m an alien sorry\u201d and it\u2019s not quite the same as \u201cpudding brains\u201d. However I do agree that the \u201cam I good man?\u201d arc would work well for 11. In fact it mostly makes because it comes *after* him (as opposed to after a less manipulative Doctor). It could have worked just as well if Matt Smith had stayed another series, but not along with the Capaldi S8 attitude. \n\nBut I\u2019m not talking about the arc here, I\u2019m talking about the tweak in personality, which is one of the things that makes S8 feel fresh and different to what comes before.\n\n>\tWe can\u2019t know for sure what would have happened if Twelve had started off more like his later self.  But given that S8 seems to be many people\u2019s least favourites, and people keep repeatedly saying that they prefer later Twelve, it seems at least somewhat likely that it would\u2019ve been more successful.\n\nJust because what they did wasn\u2019t the best, doesn\u2019t mean that something else would necessarily have been better. S8 definitely has problems and I think it\u2019s easy to latch onto the character change as the cause of people not being interested in it. But the audience doesn\u2019t necessarily know how to do things better.\n\n>\tI don\u2019t think Kill the Moon or Forest of the Night would have happened without the \u201cAm I a good man?\u201d arc.  Which may partly be your point?\n\nNo, my point was that 12\u2019s *personality* helps make these stories a bit more bearable, especially for *Forest*. It\u2019s a bit of a weird story antagonist-less story where trees save humans\u2026 having someone on screen who is very cynical about everything makes it a bit easier to get through. Even though he\u2019s not cynical about the plot itself, if we had someone bouncing around saying how wonderful everything is, it would have been much more grating. Again, I don\u2019t think you could just translate 12\u2019s cynicism on 11 without turning people off the character and essentially ruining 11 for them. \n\nI think 12\u2019s personality also \u00e9lev\u00e2tes the Robin Hood story. Even in a version of S8 where we have 11 going through the \u201cgood man\u201d arc, I can\u2019t imagine him reacting to Robin Hood in the same way, or it being enjoyable to see.\n\n>\tI agree that it\u2019s important to take risks and they won\u2019t all pay off.  I think this was a bad choice of point in the show to take that particular risk.  You apparently think otherwise, and that\u2019s fine.  There are almost as many valid perspectives as there are Doctor Who fans. :)\n\nAbsolutely agree \ud83d\ude09", "created_utc": "1666867250.0", "edited": "False", "id": "itz0tln", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_ye4erx", "parent_id": "t1_ityom84", "score": "3", "subreddit": "gallifrey", "subreddit_id": "t5_2tf29"}, {"author": "jaimepapier", "body": "I\u2019m not sure I agree that this would have worked for an existing Doctor.

Seeing 11 casually insulting people in the way 12 did would have been very off.\n\nWe can never know what would have happened if 12 had been more like he was at the end from the beginning. Maybe the ratings would have been better. Maybe just as many people would have switched off, feeling like the series was getting samey.

Anyone who continues being racist despite this is not worth my time. As strange as it may seem, it's not widely understood that eating animals is bad. Someone who continues eating animals is just acting on what has been ingrained into them their whole life.

A good translation of a novel might be very different to the original, as you have discovered. The translation of individual words might be very different to dictionary suggestions, as translators tend to aim to make things sound natural and \u201cflow\u201d in the target language. Sometimes (more likely in children\u2019s books), entire elements are changed to make text more relatable to the target culture. The French translation of *Harry Potter*, for example, changes many character\u2019s names and removes certain cultural references to things like Mars bars.\n\nAlso, constantly changing between reading sentences designed for natives and reading English will make it harder to develop general reading skills for dealing with other languages. Usually when reading another language, I recommend that learners avoid looking up words as much as possible, in order to develop skills in deducing the meaning of words from the context and also to get comfortable with not knowing every word and just enjoying the story.\n\nIf you\u2019re a complete beginning however, another approach is to look up almost *every* word. But rather than making a glossary, annotate the text directly. Then you can start figuring out the sentence structure for yourself and you can read it a few times to familiarise yourself with the new vocabulary. I do this sometimes with song lyrics of a language I am learning. I find it quite a fun exercise and usually pick up a few new things from it, though it mostly only helps to build the *receptive* part of your language (reading and listening, as opposed to speaking and writing).\n\nIf you\u2019re only 1 month in, I would say that reading authentic texts could be a great complement and a good way to build general reading skills.

However if a cisgender person were to say that to a trans person it\u2019ll obviously be bad.\n\nYou see this behaviour in almost all minority groups. Don\u2019t take it to heart. Often it\u2019s not meant seriously, often it\u2019s not really about individuals but about frustration towards mistreatment from the more privledged group (cis people in this case).\n\nI don\u2019t really know if it\u2019s very helpful behaviour or not. I know that I, as a gay man, have taken part in light-hearted \u201cstraight bashing\u201d before, but exclusively among other gay people. It\u2019s never aimed *at* anyone in particular, certainly not addressed to anyone\u2019s face and, for me at least, there\u2019s always a degree of irony and humour to it. It\u2019s somewhat cathartic, in that you\u2019re taking out your frustration on the privledged group. On the other hand, I can understand why it can be shocking or upsetting to see from the other end. Apart from being gay, I\u2019m in about every other privledged group, so I\u2019ve seen that end as well.\n\nBack to the question of: is it helpful behaviour? As I said, I don\u2019t have the answer, but I also think it\u2019s not the priority. We can\u2019t be constantly telling minority groups how to behave in order to be better accepted in society, when the rest of society still has a lot of work to do to make them feel accepted. Sometimes it might go to far, but it\u2019s pretty rare to hear of actual abuse by a minority group to a privileged group.\n\nYou said it would obviously be bad the other way around. That\u2019s because punching up can be funny and it can be justified in some (maybe many) cases. But punching down is always bad.\n\nI said I was just going to address that one point, but this does connect to you saying that you feel like trans women have a free pass. I really don\u2019t think that\u2019s true. There are so many hurdles faced by trans people throughout their lives. Before even knowing they\u2019re trans, they may well find it difficult to fit in with their peers, many are singled out for being different somehow and are bullied, many struggle with depression etc. Then there\u2019s coming out as trans, transitioning, potentially sitting on waiting lists for hormones or surgery, or paying a lot of money for these, or simply not being able to afford it. Many struggle with employment, and frequently have to come out again and again, even after transitioning and being able to \u201cpass\u201d, because bureaucracy forces them to reveal their past. Then there are many who don\u2019t want surgery or don\u2019t conform to the gender norms, and therefore struggle to be accepted as their real gender.\n\nIn summary, when you see a minority group saying they \u201chate\u201d a privileged group, don\u2019t take it personally. Don\u2019t be a \u201chey, not all cis people!\u201d person.

If you're too ill to set the cover, then it'll be the rest of the department running round like headless chickens twenty minutes before the first lesson trying to sort out your first two periods, then doing the same thing at break and lunch for the others.\n\nThen it's even worse when you come back. If you're lucky, your classes were covered by the school's own staff, but if you were unlucky, it'd be by an external cover supervisor. Nothing against people doing that thankless job, but they inevitably wouldn't know the behavioural system well and these were kids that if you didn't have an established relationship with them, they were really hard work. So you would come back to the classroom turned upside down, the kids complaining that the cover teacher didn't explain the work properly (even if they did) and a sub-standard lesson done in an even more sub-standard way. Your exam classes are now *even more* behind (because they're always behind when you're expected to get fifteen year olds to be communicatively competent in a language they don't want to learn in less than 2 and a half hours a week), your whole schedule is thrown off and say goodbye to any board pens you left in your room.\n\nAnyway, I moved to a country where I don't get paid for the first day off I miss, but honestly it's less stressful that way.

But I don\u2019t buy into that the word you say is essentially unimportant, when the incantations are given such weight in the books. If the importance is in the meaning of the word, then, again, why are they using words for magic that are meaningless for them? \n\nAn important example here is sectumsempra. Harry doesn\u2019t know what the spell does, so if the incantation is just some official thing, why does it work? He wants to do something bad to Draco, so the willpower is there, but the spell has a very specific effect that seems to be linked more to the incantation than anything else. If it\u2019s not the sounds themselves (or rather, the act of making the sounds) causing the effect, what is it?\n\nThe pronunciation of spells is (again, in my head canon) important in how it activates certain parts of your brain. So it\u2019s still important for non-verbal spells, but this is why non-verbal spells are so difficult. You\u2019re not just thinking the words, you\u2019re thinking them as if you\u2019re saying them. \n\nI also definitely think this isn\u2019t the one true way of doing magic, just as western music theory isn\u2019t the one way of doing music.

Why can\u2019t they say \u201clight\u201d instead of \u201clumos\u201d? Why does Flitwick *insist* on pronunciation when teaching wigardium leviosa? It seems the **sounds** themselves matter more than **meaning**, which is why it seems to make more sense that the former preceded the latter.\n\nHaving said that, the prehistoric wizard might have had some success shouting fire. As I said, willpower alone can produce magic (that\u2019s not just head canon, it happens). But he might one day visit another tribe and notice that *their* witch can magic fires bigger and quicker. Maybe it still takes her a few attempts, but it\u2019s quicker than him. He tries the same word himself and it works better. Two generations later, his descendant realises that it\u2019s easier if you emphasise on syllable or if you pluralise the word\u2026 It\u2019s a gradual process, not just one person making up words until something sticks. \n\nI agree with you that most wizards wouldn\u2019t have been prominent.

However, once a thing happens connected with loaded issues, people do take sides, either pro or con. Do you think he should have gone to jail for his tweet?\n\nNo, of course not. I have already said as much. But now you're using a slippery slope argument, which is another fallacy.\n\n> I won't address most of the last paragraph as I already have around half a dozen times. As for this, though...\n\nWhere exactly have you addressed the fact that free speech is a protection from government, not third parties? I have searched your post history and found nothing of the sort. Rather it seems more like you just want to ignore this fact.\n\nIf you've finally realised that freedom of speech is not at all relevant here, you need not read on, because that should put a line under this. \n\n> I didn't think that I would have to explain this one, but here goes. Reason one: he got punished for voicing an unpopular opinion. \n\nOnly indirectly. Your phrasing makes it sound like this was a plot by BBC Books to sanction someone for stepping out of line. In fact, it was a business decision because they did not want to be associated with his viewpoints. The 'punishment' of not being published (but still being paid) is inevitable but incidental to this.\n\nThe alternative is that BBC Books punishes themselves by either losing a load of writers and/or losing a bunch of sales. They have rights too.\n\n> If you can't state unpopular views, you don't have free speech. \n\nHe can state his views. However he cannot expect others to not respond to them just because he's said them.\n\nAnd again, this isn't what free speech *means*.\n\nFrom a dictionary: \"the power or right to express one's opinions without censorship, restraint, or legal penalty.\"\n\nHis viewpoint hasn't been censored because it's still on Twitter, he's not being restrained from speaking and he hasn't received a legal penalty.\n\nArticle 10 of the Human Rights Act:\n\n'Everyone has the right to freedom of expression. This right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas **without interference by public authority** and regardless of frontiers. '\n\nNo public authorities involved here, so this doesn't apply.\n\nSome people like to bring up the First Amendment, which obviously doesn't apply here as none of this happened in the States, but even if it did, it wouldn't be relevant:\n\n'Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.'\n\n[This is a really interesting video, which is about the First Amendment, but it seems to mostly apply internationally.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zeeq0qaEaLw). From 1:23 is especially relavent.\n\n> Reason two, it nudges other writers to keep their mouths shut with their own unpopular views.\n\nWell it will in that, if you say things that people don't like, they will react. Sometimes, knowing that reaction, you might decide not to say anything. That governs pretty much all social interactions. \n\nLITTLE EDIT: I was looking for a mundane example of this and then noticed again [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/gallifrey/comments/c0ovv4/how_i_was_cancelled_by_dr_who_unherd/er78gkt?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x) on the same thread. You haven't responded to it.\n\nAnother example, if I go into a job interview, and I'm rude about someone else, I probably won't be hired. That will discourage me from saying rude things about other people in future job interviews, even if I want to. That's not suppressing freedom of speech. That's just people not wanting to be around someone who is being a jerk.\n\nThe fact a viewpoint is unpopular doesn't *by itself* justify its need to be heard.\n\nOf course, it must be *possible* to express unpopular opinions/beliefs because sometimes these have other justifications of why they need to be heard. That's why the consequences stop at the state. Not only does freedom of speech stop the state from taking action against someone's viewpoint, but also everyone else's reaction has to be within the law. \n\nRemember this: *all that's happened is that he's not been published in an anthology.* He is not being prosecuted. He's not even being investigated for anything. So far as I'm aware, no one has threatened or been violent towards him and \u2013 if they have or if they are \u2013 *they* will be breaking the law.

This might happen in your training year, in your NQT year or even some weeks in your RQT year, but it would expect it to start dropping off by that point at least. If you do your NQT year in the same school that you train in, you might not need to put in so many hours, because your first year in any school is always going to be busier than the following ones.\n\nThere was definitely a marked difference in the amount I had to do in my RQT year compared to my NQT year. I know that, had I stayed longer, it would have continued dropping off, even if I took on my responsibilities.\n\n>How many years can a NQT be expected to work before having the option to potentially work part-time?\n\nI know someone who went down to part-time part way through their NQT year (so their first year after training). I don't know his exact circumstances, but the school did have to hire to make up the hours \u2013 he was already doing the job of a teacher and a half anyway \u2013 so it was entirely motivated by his choice.\n\nI think it will depend a lot on the school. The demand for English teachers is a bit lower than others, so if a school would prefer a full-time teacher, they might not pick you over another candidate. On the other hand, English departments also tend to be bigger, so there is a higher possibility that someone else will want to job share or is already.\n\nIf you start off full time and then go part time later at the same school, I think you'll be in for a better chance because usually schools don't want to lose their teachers.\n\n>Are schools in poorer areas (where I'm hoping to teach) considerably more challenging to teach in?\n\nUsually the behaviour is more challenging, but actually I think it's really the *adults* that make it. In the three schools I've worked in as a teacher (two of which on placement), the one that was in the least poor area had a lot of drama between the senior leadership and the rest of the staff, so I enjoyed it less. The school I ended up working in was in a poor area and *very* challenging behaviour, but really supportive staff. Still some SLT drama, but my second year in particular I was really glad to work there, despite the fact that some of the kids really drove me right to the edge. I work abroad now and I'm lucky to have a nice job that's pretty chill, but I still miss the insanity of my old school. Ultimately, I think the experience prepared me to be able to teach anywhere in the future.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Think I misremembered.

Taking a dip in salary, undergoing teacher training and having a newborn all at the same time just seems too much to me. Also, if you wait a year, you could try setting aside 10K of your salary to see how well you manage without it. I actually did something like this with my grant money; since the amount I earned as a trainee was actually more than I earned as an NQT, I lived as if I was earning my future NQT salary and set aside the extra as general savings. That way I didn\u2019t feel the dip.\n\nThough I teach languages, I think it\u2019s worth sharing my experience to give you a broad range to draw from. Trainee year was pretty hard work, starting work at 7:45 every day and leaving at 16:30, I then also did one or two hours at home each evening (more if I had an assignment coming up). I also worked most of one of my weekend days and sometimes both. I did well on all observations and managed to get some pretty good marks on assignments too.\n\nFor some, the NQT year is easier, but for me it was a lot harder because the school I was at had a lot of challenging behaviour to deal with. I started work at 7:30 and finished between 17 and 18. In my first term I also worked an hour at home afterwards but I stopped that quite soon because it just wasn\u2019t worth the impact on my mental health. I still worked a weekend day, but only had one or two instances the whole year of losing a whole weekend to work. I also have to say that I cried a lot in my colleagues\u2019 offices that year. It was pretty tough, but I did at least have a very supportive school. All of my NQT assessments are observations were fine.\n\nThe RQT year was a massive improvement because I had built up relationships with the kids so behaviour was more manageable (if still difficult). The school had a fairly high turnover of staff because of the behaviour of pupils, but as a result, the kids really respected staff who stuck through. I worked from more like 7:45 to 17:30, sometimes leaving even earlier, and only needed to work one day every other weekend. I even had time to write a dissertation to complete my masters and apply for jobs in France, where I am now.\n\nThough I\u2019ve (temporarily?) left secondary teaching, it was really more about leaving the country for me. Had I not wanted to go abroad, I could have easily stayed at the same school and I felt confident that the next year would have been easier still. My new job is a lot less hours than I\u2019m used to and I feel the impact on my health (I haven\u2019t been ill since I started) and on my general well-being. I do miss the challenge and I miss feeling like I make a difference in people\u2019s lives. I work in a university now and it is not at all the same. Not only is behaviour management unnecessary, but there is a lot less pressure because there is a lot more responsibility afforded to the students. For example, if a student doesn\u2019t come to my lesson, that\u2019s their outlook. Whereas if a pupil didn\u2019t come to my class at school, I would be juggling looking after my class while sending emails to find out where they are, needing to log a sanction at the end of the lesson and then have to help them catch up in the next class. That\u2019s just one example.\n\nOne last thing - I imagine you have taken this into account, but just in case - don\u2019t forget that the bursary is tax free.

It needs revisiting and reinforcing constantly.\n\n>\tIt overgeneralizes them in the same ways a learner will, though.

Text-to-speech hasn\u2019t got down natural intonation and pacing, but it does usually know all the rules and exceptions. If you know of an example of where Google\u2019s, Apple\u2019s or even Duolingo\u2019s voice software makes a mistake in the pronunciation of a word (not a name). I think of those three, Duolingo would unfortunately be the most likely culprit, though I can\u2019t think of an example myself.\n\n>\tThere\u2019s a big difference between a school kid taking a language class because they need the credits and someone studying on their own.

Unless you\u2019ve analysed your DNA, you don\u2019t know what they are. And even if you did, what would it matter? You can\u2019t see someone\u2019s chromosomes, they don\u2019t *directly* play a role in society and, until people start talking about trans issues, no one cares what chromosomes you do or don\u2019t have. There might be physical characteristics or medical conditions which we care about and which are due to certain chromosomes, but it is the characteristic or condition which is important, not the presence or absence of a chromosome.\n\nThe other issue is the binary implication of your statement. Intersex people exist. Transpeople exist. I don\u2019t know why anyone woukd think that gender and sex would be so straight forward to be limited to two categories. Very little (or nothing?) about humans is that straight forward.", "created_utc": "1548226643.0", "edited": "1551390326.0", "id": "eer3gps", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_ainrwh", "parent_id": "t1_eepzu9z", "score": "6", "subreddit": "askgaybros", "subreddit_id": "t5_2vgfw"}, {"author": "jaimepapier", "body": "I just say: \u00ab\u00a0minuteur: vingt minutes\u00a0\u00bb, which, come to think of it, is word for word what I say to Siri in English.", "created_utc": "1548020713.0", "edited": "False", "id": "eekj7ij", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_ai2mcp", "parent_id": "t3_ai2mcp", "score": "19", "subreddit": "French", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rd5t"}, {"author": "jaimepapier", "body": "I\u2019m a Brit who is normally in Lille but out of town for NYE.
