I think you're getting side-tracked.\n\nFirst point: \"(Most) education in Canada is provincial.\"  This is a side-issue that you've fixated on.  As you've basically acknowledged, the Feds do hire teachers and send them up north.  That's all I'm saying.  Whatever else is going on, the Feds are involved in education in Canada.  Hence \"(Most).\"\n\nSecond point:\n\nSay this individual faced discrimination because the school board was dumb enough to say \"We're firing you because you're Autistic and we don't want Autistic people working for us.  Also, we're total idiots because we just told you this and we love getting sued.\"\n\nKindly point out to me exactly where the form is that they should fill in to assert their charter rights to be protected against discrimination in this case.  Whom do they call in their province?\n\nShort answer: there is no such thing.\n\nYou need to go through something like the Ontario Human Rights Commission which would help you with the Ontario Human Rights Tribunal where your rights would be evaluated in light of the Ontario Human Rights Code.\n\nIf you faced discrimination in a federally regulated Bank, you'd go through the Canadian Human Rights Commission.\n\nThe Charter is for challenging government decisions and laws.  It is not for things like \"My idiot employer fired me because of my race/disability/etc.\"  The Charter was used to change the law on Marriage in Canada so that it included same-sex couples.  It was a law that did not meet Charter standards.\n\nHere is a quote from the OHRC:\n\n>An individual can only use the\u00a0Charter\u00a0to challenge a governmental decision, action or law (such as the Ontario\u00a0Code) on the grounds that it does not offer the protection to individuals provided by the\u00a0Charter.\n\nThere is no law in Ontario that says it's okay to discriminate.  Quite the contrary.  Employers in Ontario are forbidden from discriminating under the OHRA.  If they do, the individual files a complaint as outlined above.\n\nI can appreciate that you studied some law and so on.  However, to suggest that the classes I took from PhDs on this exact issue as well as the staff lawyers are all wrong?  That's a bit much.\n\nSo, I take your point that the Charter applies to provincial legislatures, but that doesn't apply to this person's situation.  Regardless, it is in fact federal law (part of the federal constitution) and *my point was that \"They would be protected by provincial human rights legislation.\"*  Telling them to avail themselves of their Charter rights isn't going to help in this situation because it doesn't apply except in that it was the inspiration for the various human rights laws.\n\nHope that clears things up for you.", "created_utc": "1664229246.0", "edited": "False", "id": "iq0zo35", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_xm4z44", "parent_id": "t1_ipzb8ml", "score": "1", "subreddit": "teaching", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qyj9"}, {"author": "Gizmosia", "body": "It\u2019s funny because that\u2019s not what they said in my degree and it\u2019s not what they said in the annual training I just recently completed. \n\nAlso, the Federal government does handle education and run schools.

It's by Ian Ford and it's called *A Field Guide to Earthlings: An autistic/Asperger view of neurotypical behavior*.\n\nMost Autistic people I've spoken to are perfectly happy being themselves.  What I hear constantly is that the world is designed by and for NTs, so that's what makes life difficult.  You can offset that a lot by affirming the inherent goodness and acceptability of his nature.\n\nI would suggest you be careful about saying things like \"rounding his development and leading a happy life.\"  This is all new for you, so I'm not judging you.  It's just that statements like that imply that there is something wrong with his development and that he cannot have a happy life being himself.

He hasn't posted for a long time, but I thought his videos were really good, especially the one on friendship.  I haven't seen them all, but they say things better than I can.\n\nOh, another video that shakes me to my core is the [Autism TMI Virtual Reality Experience](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgDR_gYk_a8).  It is so accurate, at least for me.  It's just surreal.  If you want to see what he might be experiencing, that would be a good one.

I'm just offering another possibility.\n\nAs a French person once told me in France, Anglos laugh at everything, at least from your point of view.

Or, even whatever doctors make.\n\nIn much of Europe (for SES comparison), they often make like half what they make here.\n\nNow, the working conditions for doctors and nurses here are absolute crap.  This 24-36 hour shift thing is nonsense.  Family doctors getting only 2 weeks off a year is insane.\n\nBut, guess what?  For a rough comparison, if we cut salaries in half, we'd have twice as many workers, which would massively improve work/life balance for medical staff.

It's because senior members manipulate the system to benefit themselves unequally AT THE DIRECT EXPENSE of the junior members.\n\nWe're not stupid.  We know it's rigged.  Want a few examples?\n\n* Senior members get a fully-indexed pension with no increases to their contributions.  Junior members have to pay a higher payment contribution AND get a de-indexed pension so that by the end of life, it will only have 1/3 of the purchasing power that it did on the first day of retirement.  Yes, we can do math.\n* The newest, lowest paid members need to pay $400+ per month to have health benefits.  Senior members?  Fully paid.\n* Senior members who would not even qualify for the basic job anymore refuse a subsidized, simple qualification update and also refuse to do a different job.  As a result, better-qualified junior members lose their jobs so the senior members don't have to try something new.  To be clear, the junior members lost their jobs because the senior member refused a temporary job modification, simple qualification update or not.\n* Senior membership/leadership turns a blind eye to, or openly supports, workplace bullying of junior members by senior members.  Their excuse?  Well, it was really hard for them back in the day.  Oh, so that gives them the right to rage, scream, humiliate, swear, lie, and sabotage today's junior members? Great, so we traded bullying by sociopathic management for bullying by entitled, unhinged senior members.

As for France, I'm wondering if you're confusing France's overseas territories?  They're like provinces but not part of mainland France, a bit like US & Hawaii.  Either way, \"basically still colonising\" is massively subjective and whatever you're referring to never came up while I lived there.  I'm just not going to engage with this.\n\nFor #2, I'm keenly aware of the Geography issues.  This is frequently trotted out by the telecom sector, for instance.  Ok, except, for 10 \u20ac / $15, you get in France what costs us here like $75.  That's like straight up FIVE TIMES more expensive and they still cry about it.\n\n(Personally, I believe there is SERIOUS hanky-panky going on there with the two largest parties, but I have no proof of it, of course.)\n\nWhatever effect this has, it doesn't stop us from paying for decent local health care.  It doesn't stop us from making corporations and people earning over $250k pay a comparable rate to Europe.  It doesn't stop us from putting in laws like a CEO's salary cannot exceed 25x the lowest paid employee, etc.\n\nThis is the real issue: redistribution and regulation.  If we weren't willing to accept obscene wealth disparity in Canada, we'd all be better off.\n\n(I would also suggest that Canada, often due to US influence, does not do everything it could to maximize its revenue.  Look at middle eastern countries and oil extraction/refining vs Canada.)\n\nFinally, #4.  In my experience helping people with their finances, people are short-sighted, do not understand anything about government programs, and couldn't budget their way out of a wet paper bag.  All they do is swallow \"taxes = bad\" without questioning it.\n\nWhen you file taxes, you are charged a certain percentage based on activities (earning income, buying stuff, etc.).  On the other side, you're given tax credits (for behaviour the government wants to encourage like studying and riskier investing), and money for programs (making babies, retiring, etc.).\n\nYou were concerned about what the government was TAKING from you in the form of taxes.\n\nCanada has more social programs than the US, but is seriously stingy by European standards.\n\nIn the interaction between you and the government, yes, there is TAKE but there is also GIVE.  You need to look more globally at the formula TAKE - GIVE to see it all accurately.\n\nIn our current situation, without additional revenue, if the major players (corporations and the really rich, not the middle/lower classes) were taxed more fairly, everything would be much better for the vast majority of Canadians.\n\nSaying we need a few billion to fix our healthcare (where we started) seems like a lot because our household budgets are tiny in comparison.  That could be covered VERY easily by a tiny hike in taxes on the banks alone.\n\nIn fact, simply not giving huge corporations Covid supports and tax cuts they didn't need and didn't use (if I recall correctly--there were news articles on this) for their intended purpose would probably go a long way to doing just that.\n\nI just cannot get why people who stand to gain the most are the ones who so vehemently oppose this.  Everything they say (businesses/rich people will leave) is just talking points for the people taking advantage of them and definitely has not been the case elsewhere.  If there's money to be made here, someone will step up to make it, even if they have to play more nicely than elsewhere.", "created_utc": "1659294048.0", "edited": "False", "id": "iieyaas", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_wbxrbl", "parent_id": "t1_iientoo", "score": "1", "subreddit": "ontario", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qsf3"}, {"author": "Gizmosia", "body": ">No it doesn't work\n\nYou're right.  Germany is just a fairytale.  It's a story socialists made up to deceive good, right-thinking capitalists like you.  It's definitely not a functioning society that actually exists.\n\nWhen you're at the point where you need to deny reality to preserve your beliefs, maybe a little self-examination is in order.\n\nLike a lot of people in your camp, you're fixated on taxes.  The whole system is screwed up.  Currently, its goal is to massively favour the already wealthy.\n\nI'm definitely not a communist, thanks, and that's just such a tire old insult to throw around.  Like, is that really the extent of your intellectual ability?  Commie?\n\nIf you look at GDP, inflation and wages, you're only making about 1/3 of what you should be right now vs the 1970s.\n\nYou're so brainwashed by the ruling rich to help them out by demanding lower taxes, you can't see that they're literally taking 2/3 of your salary for their yacht funds.\n\nFor example, my old CEO made my annual salary in the first 80 minutes of the first day of work of the year.  What did he do in that time?  Nothing that was worth my entire annual salary.\n\nFunds like the ones you posted are accomplishing the opposite of what you want.  You're creating a band-aid by effectively taxing yourself that \"covers\" for the government.  Charities in Canada (last I looked) made up 8% of the economy and are extremely inefficient compared to the government.  You're staving off a crisis that would require a more efficient government intervention if it wasn't being band-aided.\n\nYou're right, under the current system, Canadians are having an extremely hard time and cannot afford a tax hike.\n\nNow, read this time: IT ISN'T JUST ABOUT HIGHER TAXES ON INDIVIDUALS.\n\nIn France, for example, there is excellent public transportation.  It's cheap to begin with and employers pay half for you if that's how you get to work.  Great cell phone plans?  5-10 \u20ac / month.  After a recent discussion, groceries are about half as expensive.  Paris real estate is bonkers, but everywhere else, it's way cheaper than here.  Kids get a bursary for back to school expenses.  Many places pay for their piano lessons.  No one needs an RRSP because they take care of you in retirement.  No one needs an RESP because tuition is around 200 \u20ac/yr, even for things like medical school.\n\nIT NETS OUT.  Taxes can be higher than 5% more, but you'd have more doctors if they didn't have to run the risk of flunking out of medical school with hundreds of thousands in debt.  KEEP READING: The individuals get it back in various subsidies (simply called 'redistribution') so that everyone is better off.  They also have higher social mobility than we do.  It works out to approximately 5% more.\n\nPeople are generally (like 95%) financial idiots, which I know professionally.  Look at rural Republicans fighting tooth and nail against universal health care because IF they ever get rich, they don't want the government taxing them.  Now, tell me about your 3 family members who went bankrupt over minor procedures...\n\nSo, basically, I simplified because (see above) people are financial idiots.  The government might tax more up front, but then they hand it all back to you in cash and/or a higher quality of life which is also insulated from crises and instabilities.\n\nPeople still have nice houses, nice cars and send their kids to nice schools.  Don't worry, people with better jobs still have more disposable income.  There is still keeping up with the Jonses.  They even have (gasp!) private health care, private schools, and even private mansions!  Their rich are richer than ours, but our poor are poorer than theirs.  Their middle class, I would say from personal experience, is far better off than ours, but I admit that's subjective.\n\nNow, in my experience, no matter what I say to someone with your views, this is where you're simply going to ignore everything I've seen, lived and even done professionally, and double down on what you hold to be true based on your personal beliefs and experience which does not include living, studying and working in France, for example.\n\nI dare you to prove me wrong on this last point: open your mind and learn something.", "created_utc": "1659280074.0", "edited": "False", "id": "iie161j", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_wbxrbl", "parent_id": "t1_iidcel5", "score": "1", "subreddit": "ontario", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qsf3"}, {"author": "Gizmosia", "body": "Kind of a side issue, but one that always drove me crazy.\n\nThe ease with which they betray a confidence or blithely disregard issues of privacy.\n\nWorse, it's done in the name of \"prayer requests,\" \"accountability,\" or \"support.\"\n\nJust more double-speak where they use the same words but quietly redefine them to suit their purposes.\n\nAnyone living in the real world calls this what it is: gossip.", "created_utc": "1659270534.0", "edited": "False", "id": "iidhsx6", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_wcbhcn", "parent_id": "t3_wcbhcn", "score": "22", "subreddit": "Exvangelical", "subreddit_id": "t5_dltoa"}, {"author": "Gizmosia", "body": "First, I\u2019m not going to look it all up again for someone who talks to me like that.

It would then be law and go into effect.  After that, people could fight it in court where it would likely be struck down.\n\nThat's not short-circuiting the system.  That's how the system is supposed to work.\n\nI'm talking about creating ridiculous voting districts that are clearly meant to give an advantage to one party or the other, for example.  That is clearly a loophole that has been exploited to skew an outcome.  It has since been deemed \"legal\" by a court that was stacked with overtly partisan judges, which is another means of skewing outcomes.\n\nIn other systems, a non-partisan committee decides voting districts and judges are not allowed to be political.  Clearly, neutrality in districting and in the selection of judges would produce election outcomes and judgements that are far more neutral/unbiased/fair.  Most importantly, fair in the eyes of the public.\n\nThe current crisis in the US is not about abortion, it is about the almost universal belief that the system is corrupt, which it is.\n\nAll systems have people who love power far, far too much.

There is a difference between that and posting information that goes against clear, mainstream guidance on the subject.\n* Again, not emotional blackmail, but to me, 33 dead kids is a lot.  I'm more focussed on the people than the numbers.  Besides, I'm not limiting myself to Canada.  The point is, healthy children have died from it, wherever they are.\n* Comorbidities.  I'm telling you I've read mainstream news articles and watched videos of crying parents saying their kid did not have any.  Please tell me we don't have to descend to crisis actor conspiracy theories here.\n* Yes, kids are at risk all the time.  Do you put a seatbelt on yours?  To my mind, good parents mitigate risk when possible, even if it's inconvenient.  They put their fears aside and listen to experts as opposed to arrogating themselves to that status.  (Not necessarily you, but many responses here.)\n* Opinions of Drs and nurses.  1) There seem to be a ton of anti-vax nurses, which I find ridiculous, so zero credence given.  2) Doctors and scientists are almost totally behind the vaccines.  If not, their college can deal with it.  Like put up or shut up.  That tiny minority needs to produce peer-reviewed evidence of harm or face discipline, IMHO.\n* I'm sorry.  Rand Paul?  Anyway, that information was not just revealed.  We've known about that for ages.  They're going based on a proportionate amount of antibodies present.  It really isn't about the kids, it's about the antibodies and the virus.  If the right antibodies are present, it's kind of unrelated to the individual.  They go after the virus.\n* Long-term safety studies.  From my point of view, the safety studies they've just completed have been very \"long.\"  That's literally the main focus.  Besides that, I can't tell you how many virologists and vaccine experts have been saying that vaccine safety issues, when they do come up, occur shortly after receiving the vaccine.  If you look at the people compensated for vaccine injury in Canada, it didn't come up like years later.  It happened right away.\n\nPerhaps I didn't say it in our conversation, but children who died is not the only issue.  If you look in the article, they're saying up to 1/4 of kids are experiencing long covid.  There are also lagging studies (talk about long-term consequences), showing that totally asymptomatic kids are winding up with clots in their lungs, brains, and other organs.  We don't know the long-term harm this disease is going to cause.  I'd prefer to be as protected as possible.\n\nAs for the rest, you seem to be confusing mandates and my issue: vaccine availability.  I get that the pandemic has been very hard on people and I don't want to minimize that at all.  None of this was the issue I raised, though.  I specifically wanted to avoid discussion of the validity of the vaccine, and I have no idea where the mandate posse came from.\n\nI simply posted about the vaccine becoming available for little kids.\n\nBased on further reading, I guess I'm figuring out that r/Canada has been taken over by the Republican party, the trucker-freedom-mandate crowd and a bunch of anti-vaxers.\n\nIt's funny how the free-speech, \"I get to decide for myself--don't tell me what to do\" crowd cannot seem to handle someone saying they want to decide something different than the local group-think.  Actually, it's pretty disturbing.\n\nPlease keep in mind I'm referring to the overall reaction I got, and I'm not specifically putting what you wrote in the cross-hairs. \n\nThe guidance is crystal clear.  The choice to opt out used to be for extreme circumstances.  It's been popularized into something edgy and has basically become an identity issue.  Unfortunately, people who clearly are not capable of making an informed decision without the help of experts are now making uninformed decisions, which amounts to self-harm as a lifestyle choice.\n\nIf nothing else, one thing is clear.

Really.  Thank you.\n\nLong story short, with vaccine 1.0 vs. virus 1.0, let's say you had kind of a 1:1 antibody to virus ratio to make it effective.  So, it worked really well.\n\nNow, with vaccine 1.0 vs virus 4.5, it still \\*kinda\\* works, but the antibodies aren't seeing the virus as well.  So, the booster \"boosts\" the number of antibodies to a (I'm inventing numbers here) 3:1 ratio.  By increasing the number of antibodies, maybe only 25% of them will latch on to the virus, but that's enough to get a decent job done.  (If it was originally all 1000 antibodies that latched on, 25% of 3000 is still 750.)\n\nSo, good, but definitely not as good of a job as when the vaccine is built for the virus, though.\n\nAs I said, this was never intended to be a long-term solution.\n\nThis fall, vaccine 4.0 is coming out to combat virus 4.5.\n\nStill not perfect, but it will once again be FAR more effective because it is custom built for the current virus family.\n\nTo bring it full circle, every year, the flu vaccine is reinvented based on projections about which four flu variants will be the most common.  One shot contains three to four vaccines that protect you for that flu season only.\n\nSo, you only need one flu vaccine because by next season, those variants are gone.\n\nWe're headed to a similar place with Covid.

I'm assuming it's for the reasons I explained above.\n\nThe thing is, between the facebook science crowd, the anti-vaxx crowd, the conspiracy theory crowd and people in the media who have no clue what they're reporting on, the message has been garbled completely.\n\nCurrently, numbers are relatively low, but a booster would help people stay safe through to when the new vaccine comes out in a few months.\n\nI'm just hoping that people aren't too far gone to listen to reason when it becomes available.  \n\nBecause there are extremely good reasons to get it.", "created_utc": "1655838397.0", "edited": "False", "id": "id7qnpe", "is_submitter": "True", "link_id": "t3_vgqkcr", "parent_id": "t1_id73xuz", "score": "2", "subreddit": "canada", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh68"}, {"author": "Gizmosia", "body": "Well, if you look at the article, there is more to this than death.\n\nTo my mind, in a global pandemic, I want to do everything I can to prevent kids from winning the \"covid death lottery.\" \n\nBeyond that, the lagging studies are showing more and more permanent, latent injuries that could resurface down the road.\n\nFor example, many kids who showed zero symptoms (didn't even know they had it) were left with clots in their lungs, brains and other major organs.\n\nHow is that going to affect them down the line?\n\nThere are a lot of rumblings in public health about a possible upcoming variant which could be much, much worse.

I tried to ask feminists on Reddit.  I figured it would be an academic-level question.  I was attacked more viciously (verbally) than I have ever been in my life.  I used to call myself a feminist.  No longer.  Still absolutely pro-equality, but that is not what feminism is anymore.  It's female supremacy.\n\nTwo, a few hours from where I live, a man came home to his house to find a drunk woman he'd never seen before passed out on the front step of his house.  He woke her and asked if she was okay.  She started attacking him.  Some nearby construction workers ran over and beat him badly because they wouldn't listen to him trying to say he was the one being attacked.  They were more interested in white-knighting.\n\nWe live in a time where equality is meaningless, reason is meaningless, rules are meaningless and people are crazy and tribal.\n\nThose are the rules.  You cannot change them.  The sooner you accept that, the happier you'll be.  Accordingly, put yourself in a situation where you share characteristics with those around you and stop trying to will the world to be different.  YOU can be kind to others, but dont expect OTHERS to be kind to you.  Be happy with kindness when you find it and stop being naive.  You need to protect yourself so you don't burn out in life.  You are not obliged to help every person you meet who needs help if it means you don't have the energy/resources left to feel safe and whole.\n\nThere are certain ironies in interacting with people.  If you play a bit hard to get, you're more attractive in dating.  Similarly, if you try to be Mr Nice Guy all the time, you're a bully magnet.  You need to project a bit of a \"don't even think about it\" attitude if you don't want them to crush your spirit.\n\nCheck out YouTube channels like Charisma on Command.  It's basically a series of case studies of the unwritten rules of NT life.  Yes, there will be tons of people who will tell you we shouldn't have to mask, blah, blah.  Well, guess what...a bit of pragmatism, please?  No, you shouldn't have to, but you sound pretty miserable.  Maybe learning to camouflage a bit would help.

We're currently experiencing Covid 4.5.\n\nThis fall, a new version of the vaccine is coming out and will cover Covid 1.0 and 4.0.\n\nIf you get the 1.0/4.0 vaccine, chances are Covid 5.0 won't kill you.

You've probably been \"infected\" by measles or chicken pox a bunch of times.  You didn't know it because you either had a vaccine or previous infection which taught your immune system to fight it off before you got noticeably ill.\n\nMost people got it after 3 doses because Covid 4.0-4.5 is ridiculously contagious.  It was approaching the level of measles at one point, but I think it has passed that now, if I'm not mistaken.  With measles, if someone is contagious and spends time in a room, you can catch it even if that person left 20-30 minutes before your entered the room.\n\nUnfortunately, with Covid, you might cough up your lungs if your immune system isn't up to date.  The point is to learn it the easy way (vaccine) or the hard way (potentially serious illness or death).  With the current level of contagiousness (like measles), imagine if it suddenly mutates and becomes as deadly as original SARS or MERS.

Everyone has the right to communicate with the Federal government in English or French, as they choose.\n\nAn \"pseudo-bilingual\" anglophone living in the west would never be forced to speak French to get their taxes done.  That would cause a level of hysteria eclipsing the early days of the pandemic and set of armageddon itself.\n\nSimilarly, you can't ask French-bilinguals to speak English just because they can.\n\nUltimately, almost no one is perfectly bilingual, even if they were raised in it.  If the English speaking parent taught the bilingual kid how to do taxes, they kid might not know how to say tax terms in French and vice-versa.\n\nYes, English is dominant.  So, French people feel a distinct lack of power in some ways.  The fact that there are more bilinguals in Montr\u00e9al than anywhere else in the country is maybe not such a bad thing if it helps balance out the disadvantages a bit.  That said, like I mentioned before, if someone knows they want to work for the civil service, then language study should be motivating for them.  It's a basic qualification.  Typically, the people here who cry injustice on that are the same ones who say things like \"you just need to work hard and stay in school--the world doesn't owe you anything\" because they don't want their taxes being used to support people -they- deem lazy or undeserving somehow.

So, why are you using French monolingual speakers for comparison instead of French bilingual?  I think it's interesting that only 57% of Canadians have English as a first language, and 21% are French native-speaker ([source](https://www.canada.ca/en/canadian-heritage/services/official-languages-bilingualism/publications/statistics.html)).\n\nBesides, if you're looking at the FEDERAL government, of course it's going to be skewed a bit.  It's an essential part of some jobs in a bilingual government to be able to communicate in both languages.  That's like saying it's unfair that most of those cushy hospital jobs require people to have medical training!  What about the rest of us?  All we get is the crappy leftover jobs because we didn't study medicine!\n\nSo, if you want to work for a government that sometimes need to do things in both languages, it's an essential part of the job to study the other official language.  It's part of the qualification to get the cushy job.\n\nSay you're an...accountant.  Whatever it is doesn't matter.  And, you want to work in the federal government.  Ok, so you should major in accounting and minor in French.  A minor is like 10 semester-long courses.  That would be more than adequate to teach a pure, start-from-zero anglo enough French to work in a bilingual environment.  In some schools, it also spares you form taking a bunch of random useless courses you didn't want, anyway.\n\nWhat completely blows my mind is people born and raised in Ottawa who say this.  It's like they have so, so much access to French Immersion, French schools, French classes and clubs, a bilingual university, etc.  Yet, they seem to be the first to complain.\n\nSure, some people are raised bilingual.  That's an advantage.  Some people's parents foot the entire bill for medical school.  Some people grow up away from French, with no immersion/clubs/classes, and need to put themselves through school by scraping away serving coffee.\n\n(By the way, I didn't look at your post history, so if you're an accountant in Ottawa, that's pure coincidence.

I thought you would have liked that.\n\nMy point about bilingualism was primarily that in nearly every country on the planet people are at least bilingual if not multilingual.  Everyone of average mental capacity can learn a second language.  The issue is motivation, not ability.\n\nIn Canada's system, regular MPs don't need to be bilingual.  It's higher ups like ministers and the de facto resident head of state (Governor General, who isn't, btw).  Well, they have federal-level responsibilities.  They should be able to speak with both major language groups recognized in the constitution...  Like, would you be happy if the Justice Minister couldn't speak English?\n\nI don't know why you think people can't criticize the government.  Maybe if you're not a citizen yet?  I dunno.  I think people do it all the time.  And, we should.  I think that Canada is a pretty good place to be, so saying it's a frozen socialist wasteland is not going to go over well, of course, but I doubt you said anything of the sort.\n\nI think the party system and the electoral system in Canada need to be trashed.  Absolutely.  We need some form of proportional representation like, what, 80% of democracies?  Take Ontario, for example.  I forget the percentages, but basically 2/3 of voters have no local representation reflecting their vote in the legislature after the yesterday's election.  That's completely obscene and anti-democratic.  They keep lying about fixing it, just like they lie about fixing the environment, transit, the health care system, telecom, etc. The lack of accountability is horrible.  It also circles back to corporate interests, just like in the US.\n\nI'm totally sick of the tokenism we live with and the insulting (to our intelligence and to Americans) standard of \"Well, it's better than in the US...\" Well, that's smug, nasty, and useless.  I'd like to live in a country that wants to build a bright future rather than just do the minimum to maintain the status quo.\n\nThere.  Feel better?

I'm not saying you're off the wall or anything.\n\nNo Canadian is kept from any office due to their bilingual status because any Canadian capable of holding that office is capable of learning French.  Almost everywhere else in the world, monolingualism is an aberration.  Also, the bar to \"bilingualism\" for politicians is embarrassingly low.  As a fully bilingual person, I can assure you that these people sound like idiots in their second language.  It is not a barrier.\n\nOtherwise, I definitely agree that our institutions should be overhauled.  I was aware of these weaknesses, and you are right.  Canada's default position is to send an issue out for a study until things calm down and then ignore said study years later.\n\nIn the US, a majority of states are tinkering with the democratic process now so that if citizens vote \"incorrectly,\" the state government can overrule the people and send a different set of electors to the college.  That's legal and it's happening.\n\nPart of the reason we pay attention to US events is because a) Canada is stable and therefore boring and b) many US issues and events are soul-destroying dystopian nightmares.\n\nThe US absolutely should be the legitimately greatest nation on earth.  It really should.  Unfortunately, it has been taken over by a tiny handful of obscenely wealthy individuals who are effectively a monarchy.  I guess an oligarchy.  The People are paying the price.

Unfortunately, I cannot figure out how to quote, so please bear with me.\n\nI brought up autism because it is a significant issue for me.  Currently, as quite clearly demonstrated here, I can't seem to say anything right and have an equally difficult time understanding what people are trying to tell me.  It is isolating in the extreme.\n\nCase in point.  I meant I didn't act out in anger like people in this sub did toward me.  I didn't swear at anyone, put them down, question their motives, etc.\n\nYes, getting automatically rejected without explanation made me angry.  It was extremely unkind.\n\nI'm really not an autism activist like in your allegory, but I think I understand your point.\n\nI would like to make it clear that I sympathize with your frustration.\n\nI agree that there is a lot of misogyny.  If you happen to be American, I believe there is a huge difference between your experience and mine.  I only recently became aware of how very misogynist the US is.\n\nThe thing is, if you substitute any other identifiable group for \"men\" in what you're saying, you might see how there is a problem.  If you said, \"I cannot explain to you how exhausting it is to explain the bare minimum to (blacks/gays/disabled people) only for them to fight you the whole way through.\"\n\nThe issue is, -I- was a man who came in good faith with genuine questions, asked permission to post, asked for guidance on how to word things sensitively, etc.\n\nYet, -I-, as an individual, was met with a level of hate that I have rarely experienced in any other context.  Literally, I have been physically attacked by people speaking to me like some people here did.\n\nIn my world, I give 99 morons the benefit of the doubt so that the one genuine, good person isn't missed.  That is very bad for my mental health, but that's my choice.\n\nOne thing you may not have considered is that what you described is how men often learn.  Most are not like me.  They go into any learning situation confrontationally because they're terrified of losing, looking dumb or looking weak.\n\nThey also do this because they like to test out their ideas, argue about them, see what comes up spontaneously in debate, live the interaction, and get a rush out of it.  They will say idiotic things to see how you react and if you stand up to them, they'll deem you a worthy adversary and think about what you said.\n\nDon't expect them to admit they were wrong.  Ever.  They'll just start living differently and physically smack their friends up the back of the head one day and tell them not to be so sexist.\n\nIf you're experiencing these things (confrontation), you've been treated with respect because they see you as someone worth talking to.\n\nCurrently, I see feminism as having two massive problems.  1) By default, it won't listen to men.  2)  It expects men to act like women in order to be deemed acceptable enough to be heard.\n\nIn my view, this leads to circling the wagons.  Cutting men off (at a movement level, not personally if you're exhausted) isn't exercising power, it's just passive aggression.  (Yes, men do exactly that, but in different circumstances.  That is also wrong.)\n\nMen are emotionally constipated and exhausting, but they're people who live in society with you.  You can't expect them to stop being men.  But, a lot of them are really good people who are frustrated with the same idiots you are frustrated with.\n\nPerhaps someday, a person who self-identifies as an ally to women will be able to interact here.  However, as much as I really do appreciate your post, I am  out of here.  The way I have been treated by many people is absolutely inexcusable and I have recently made a promise to myself that I will no longer subject myself deliberately to outright abuse.\n\nI wish YOU well, and I hope that you recognize how valuable your contributions are, even if you can't see the results right away.\n\nPS-Keep in mind I can never say anything right.

To me b-tch was always only what you said when a woman did something nasty to someone and enjoyed doing it.  It never, ever had anything to do with her gender.  I've now learned that people have used it when a woman \"got out of line,\" or asserted herself.

So, why did they go after communists?\n\nBusiness interests.  The US has seen an unrelenting erosion of workers' rights since the 1950s.  Communism wasn't the real problem.  Small-s socialism was, as it stood in the way of increased profit margins.  Consequently, the powers that be connected the two concepts in the mind of the public (Communism\\* = United Soviet SOCIALIST Republic) so that people (in the US) now think that universal health care, maternity leave and fair wages would bring about the unexplained disappearances of their family members, food shortages and the loss of free speech.\n\nI think you'll find even more recent examples where the US's most cherished values have again been completely sidelined by and for business interests under the guise of protecting the public from strawman bogeymen (book banning, washroom hysteria, etc.).\n\nI am certainly not a communist, personally.  It's a great theory, but it doesn't work.  However, you mentioned in another post about leftists yearning for oppression.  Um, perhaps you don't realize that you are oppressed?  I mean, because wages have been surreptitiously redirected for decades toward the yacht funds of billionaires, you're literally only getting about 33% of what your gross salary should be if wages had kept pace.  (And people complain about taxes being \"theft...\")  Similarly, if capitalism is so great, why does US privatized health care cost twice as much as that of other countries while still demanding you have caps and co-pays?  Same answer.  Business interests.\n\nI'm just saying that from the viewpoint of most of the rest of the industrialized world, communism isn't the scary end of the spectrum.  It's hyper-capitalism.\n\nJust food for thought.\n\n\\*EDIT: I am using the term communism to refer to the horrible, twisted version of communism that has been implemented in the world which amounts to nothing more than petty dictatorship, not true communism.  That said, it would appear that human nature, as it currently exists, is incapable of being selfless enough to implement the real thing.
