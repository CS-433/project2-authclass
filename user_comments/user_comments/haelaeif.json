[{"author": "haelaeif", "body": "Motorola G6 power charging port is going. Could have it fixed, but past experiences with having charging ports fixed on phones is just that the shops that do this around here do crappy jobs; inevitably I run up a tab of \u00a3150-\u00a3200 in various repairs and then the phone breaks within 3 months. I would do this myself (I have worked with hardware in other respects) but my uncorrected vision is at the legally blind point of 1/10, and my corrected vision is only a little short of that. \n\nSo, my Q. If longevity for $/\u00a3 is your one concern, which Pixel do you get? A refurbed 6a, 6, 6 pro, a (probably new) 7a, 7 or 7 pro? I will basically use this thing until it physically breaks in some way that seems unrepairable. Google does in-house repairs I believe, so I might be able to make this last longer than the 3-year-old G6Power. \n\nOther desires are:\n\n* good battery life. The g6 power's was/is great, 5000mah, but I imagine newer phone might wear battery down faster. I'll also have to use an external DAC which will make this worse. \n* at least 126GB storage. I'd like more storage (music), but I am poor.\n* a good camera for blog photos (close-up shots predominately) and the odd youtube video. I'm not making bank from either endeavour, so to reiterate, longevity is the main concern. \n* I don't care about visual fidelity (beyond the photo quality) nor refresh rate.

Writing not to antagonize, and I think we may have had some miscommunication and I was a bit overly harsh and in a way that didn't necessarily address positions you actually hold.\n\nThe other commenter skipped past Japonic loans in Koreanic, I suppose because it seems obvious to linguists; just wanted to reemphasize these were absolutely a thing too. Splitting into headings so my ranting is easier to digest....\n\n**The limits of reconstruction**\n\nWhat we are saying when we cannot reconstruct a language's external relations is 'we just can't reconstruct this language's relations within a reasonable time depth,' and a similar thing applies to words.\n\nWe *literally* cannot know, but I'd say it's doubtful that, say, Korean or Basque had no (now unattested) extant relatives 6,000 years ago, for the simple facts of distribution we see with regard to isolates vs. languages that are the members of larger families. Take pre-contact America - as far as we can tell, the vast majority of those languages were not isolates; so in other words I'm making a claim about probability here, that any given isolate today probably wasn't an isolate at X point in history. FWIW I don't know anyone who has made such an argument in academic linguistics, so this is a bit off the theme of the sub, and as such I cannot provide citations. But I think the reason it is not discussed in linguistics is less because it is a reasonable argument (that I'm sure one can formally do that math for), and more that it is simply not the kind of question that interests us as linguists, being as it is that *linguists don't see taxonomic or phylogenetic classifications as value judgements.*\n\nIt's also extremely doubtful, on average, that any given unattested language X was not in immediate contact with other languages, doing all the things we see in attested history: loaning, influencing, borrowing. It may be more or less likely depending on georgraphy, technology, etc.\n\nIn terms of words, then, what it means when we cannot reconstruct any related words for it (and for many Japanese words, there will be cognates in Ryukyuan, Hachijo, etc. so one could readily object to the term \u5927\u548c\u8a00\u8449) *is simply that*. It doesn't mean this word wasn't borrowed beyond a time depth we can reconstruct to, etc., because by definition *we can't tell.*\n\n(In terms of telling if something was a Koreanic loan into Japonic or vice versa, as well, the issue is tricky, but there are certain methodologies one can apply to try to figure it out. Your best bet here is to rely on people *like* Vovin, or the generation now succeeding him, or to learn to do this yourself.)\n\n**Languages are not platonic forms**\n\nI raised this point in the other thread, but your notions of 'Japanese' are ultimately socially constructed; languages really aren't fixed entities, rather they are permeable and constantly in flux. We project regularities and commonalities upon them, to categorize taxonomically or for socio-politico-cultural reasons. Ultimately the *specific way in which* you see people from 1300s Akita and 1600s Nagasaki as having much in common is due to a specifically *modern* idea of nationalism.\n\nThe reason this is relevant to you, is that, as per above, you have to understand that what you view as *Japanese* is relative, and that when linguists make taxonomic classifications, this is not a specifically *cultural* judgement, it is a *linguistic* one. Now, there's a huge caveat here, that being that, intelligibility rates etc etc are inevitably hard to operationalise, so such decisions with regard to whether we say language or dialect or variety etc. tend to bypass the linguistic and instead be made on the basis of the political.\n\nBut in general linguists worth their salt are not fooled by this, that is they don't attach value judgements to the terms language, dialect, variety, lect, etc., and just focus on linguistic criteria; eg. it's obvious Singlish is a variety with many subvarieties, there's no real interest in arguing if it is a dialect or language or what, and linguists usually only engage in such actions based on personal political beliefs and what they feel is morally right. (So for example, relevant to conversation, it actually had to be argued for some time that the Ryukyuan languages and Hachijo are things worthy of the moniker *language*, and in fact that they are not languages but rather dialects is *the position maintained by the Japanese government today.)*\n\n**Arguments about words and value judgements**\n\nI feel these are broadly beyond the scope of the sub - arguably this whole thread kinda is, given not one reference has been shared- , so I'm asking the mods for some lenience here.\n\nSo first when you read any etymology in a book, particularly one that contains an argument about reconstruction, what you're basically doing when you take it at face value is ceding to its argument. That is, you are taking an epistemological position of (a) I agree with this argument or (b) ok well it says this and I don't know enough or care enough to argue and it checks out. Why is this relevant? Well, because a good etymology is an argument with data. Vovin for sure got things wrong, he was just a - very good, someone I respect immensely - scholar making arguments. Random historical dictionaries can very well get things wrong. You either pick whichever one you like based on XYZ and take it at face value, or, well, you literally learn to read the arguments, to analyze them, to do etymology yourself (which is *also* a completely different skill realistically from doing linguistic reconstruction yourself.)\n\nThere isn't really a middle ground here, it is literally 'do I care enough about the origin of this word to start learning Old Korean/Japanese to figure it out' or 'do I only care about it enough to look at scholarly literature not knowing these languages' etc etc etc. This might come across as blunt, but honestly the only way you can argue with etymologies or reconstruction is by learning how to (a) do them, (b) read scholarly literature in the field. The only way you're going to know if a source knows what the hell it's talking about is also doing this.\n\nI - and I'm sure other people here - on the r/asklinguistics, r/linguistics, r/japonic, r/classicaljapanese, r/LearnJapanese, r/MiddleKorean, etc. subs are happy to talk etymologies all day with you - you'll find many of us here 400% love this stuff -, but ultimately we're all individuals falling back to our ability to do (a) and (b), and you need to understand that *none of us* and *no source* are some divine font of etymology.\n\n**Onto value judgements....** (This is the part most out of keeping with the sub, and I will remove it if the mods ask.)\n\nSo, referring back to my point that language(s) are ultimately delineated by what are essentially social constructions, any impulse towards seeing a language or word as specifically *unique* simply because of its taxonomy IMO misses the things that make intangible cultural heritages valuable and IMO can also be deeply insensitive, both to those who are dead (who cares, right???) *but also to people who are alive*.\n\nIn short, it's cultural fetishisation. It's like waling into a room full of Scots or Native Americans and saying *you're unique and interesting because you're a Scot/Native American*. On the one hand, I'm sure many individuals would take this as a compliment, on the other hand, this is kind of deeply insensitive, whether we're talking about Native Americans, deaf people, the Ainu, or the dead people of 1300s Oita prefecture, because you're basically equating their value with being a function of their difference. People and culture generally are not museum artefacts.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs final thoughts, (a) you seem to be consistently ignoring *grammar*. Koreanic imported a huge influence on Japonic grammar going into Middle Japanese, and you're going to find this in borrowed elements within otherwise Japonic words as well as basically embedded into the structure of anything you say in Modern Japanese. and (b) cultures are not somehow less unique and interesting because they influence each other and borrow words. if this were the case, you'd reject Modern Japanese as interesting because it has coexisted with dialects and Ryukyuan; much less Korean.", "created_utc": "1665596452.0", "edited": "1665597092.0", "id": "is1pixi", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_y0wqu9", "parent_id": "t1_is16gml", "score": "2", "subreddit": "asklinguistics", "subreddit_id": "t5_2u7nj"}, {"author": "haelaeif", "body": "I don't know of any off the top of my head, but it seems like it's a very rare feature if there are, and that's partly why this is usually introduced using examples with morphological case marking. \n\nIn the WALS sample at least, languages with erg-abs alignment in noun phrases (you can look at alignment in verbs, too, but I took noun phrases to be more pertinent here) and no morphological case marking amount to three. \n\nFor the two that I could quickly find good sources for, it's safe to say that there's more involved than just word order.", "created_utc": "1665372952.0", "edited": "False", "id": "irpyuau", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_xzq6eq", "parent_id": "t1_irpvd0a", "score": "3", "subreddit": "linguistics", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhos"}, {"author": "haelaeif", "body": "Ah actually I said in another comment that I didn't know about nvidia drivers.

I ended up thinking that native words had this sort of \"home-ness\" to them, that they are unique to the culture and that culture alone. I'd seen them as ties for the modern people to their origins.\n\nHmm. This and the next two replies of yours suggest to me that you're not really getting what I'm getting at here. That is that, Japanese, Korean, other isolates like Ainu, Basque; simply because they have no relations we can demonstrate did not mean the language was brought to the earth 500 years before attestation by aliens. Rather, they would have been like languages as we know them today, in that they would have variously belonged to families, been progenitors of families, or been isolates themselves, doing all the things languages do things amongst each other like influence each other grammatically, loan or borrow words, etc. (The fact that Koreanic, Tungusic, and Japonic share certain things in common - even if this common grammar is often overstated by any reasonable standard - is *probably*, and that is a very important word, no accident of history.)\n\nFor the dialect part, I was obviously getting at the point that you could classify your 'Japanese' as a family, rather than a language, but I see you mention IE, so, you've foregone that point. So, to address that, ancient IE cultures share certain things, and certain grammar, but their similarities have been and are often overstated. The only difference here is that IE has a time depth of 6,000 years or so. Japonic, while it's harder to date, given that it is an isolate language/family, likely came to the archipelago far more recently than that, around 3,000 years ago, which, you might note, is earlier and/or about the same time that a number of branches split from IE; ergo, by your own reasoning here, you should be looking at regional varieties of Japanese/Ryukyuan/Hachijo, not 'Japanese' (also, yes, this is facetious, if you start idolizing some isolated dialect for its purity, you're running into all the same pitfalls). There's plenty of evidence of contact with Korean within Old Japanese, and it just seems odd to me to say that Japanese culture is somehow 'more unique' as a culture simply because 'if we necessarily define Japanese so as to exclude all these individual things as distinct' then 'it has had/has no linguistic relatives.' Like, this just seems like an absurdist line of argument to me. It's not *because* of this that Japanese culture is unique/has value. And, if it is, that's kind of a low bar...\n\n> Also, going on Wiktionary and seeing a lot of entries for French derived words being described as \"displacing native of Old English blank\" doesn't help either.\n\n> ...\n\n> I start hearing nationalist knocking when I think of this. I get ideas like \"Well we didn't let someone else's lowly words contaminate our great language\" or some crap like that.\n\nI don't really get where you're going with either of these. I mean, I already pointed to circumstances where purism is a totally cool thing for a community of speakers to do, and hinted at how that looks like in a productive fashion. \n\nEnglish is a good example of the culture:dialect thing, in that it's not like Cynfer\u00f0 in Northhumbria saw himself as English in the same way you see him as English. Again, we have English writers in the Middle English period remarking on their difficulties understanding people in other parts of the country; Charles may as well argue the Dutch are English, too, if language is our yardstick, and invade tomorrow. That more standardised forms have wiped this variation out in the UK and Japan is not really pertinent or relevant, but to the extent that it is, I'd point out that this is what has happened with standard Japanese; or, in other words, this process of one variety influencing another is not fundamentally different whether it's Chinese influencing Japanese or Japanese influencing local language/dialect. Again, 3,000 years is simply not that long ago; this is about the same time-depth as Celtic.\n\nIn terms of the value judgements, like... yeah, I don't see any reason a native compound is preferable to just using this other guy's word for something in most instances, extremes aside. Linguistic and cultural development isn't some zero-sum game, it's not clear to me how for example 'English' is less 'English' or 'unique' because it has some French influence, especially given that the idea of 'English' as we have it today didn't really develop until long after that influence was there... Maybe you think that addresses the former but not the latter, ie. 'uniqueness,' but I think that is just daft - are you less unique because you do things in your daily life that were once the province of other cultures or economic classes only? It seems very historically short-sighted to me for one to presume that culture is some zero-sum game, and that everything novel is some loss of self, no more so than moving over on a bench to let someone sit down does. \n\nTo touch on the extremes. You might think of something like scientific vocabulary in English. Well, isn't this exclusionary for the common man? First, not really, just because you can decompose a word doesn't mean you can actually understand it in an academic context. German physicists study for the same period as English ones (give or take idiosyncrasies to the education systems). Second, such exclusion isn't always rooted in the number of non-borrowed roots you use, though this can be a tool to do so, many languages do this simply by using a different form of the language, that eg. uses many archaicisms. \n\nSo, yeah. I mean, this seems fine as artistic endeavour, fine as fun. And if you're a member of the community (I feel like by your admission you're not, cf. point about learning the rules of the game) then, sure, purism can be fine and good, and better and cooler if other people wanna do it with you. \n\nBut the trouble is here, if you're trying to ground this in logic, you're just barking up a tree. I mean, Japanese has inherited Korean words, and some of the grammatical markers internal to the language are of Korean origin. Are you going to stop using those? Like, are you going to seek out and avoid using a word like \u5148\u3093\u3058\u308b because the -\u3093\u3058- here contains a morpheme most likely borrowed from Korean? Are you even able to tell what stuff in native Japanese words is borrowed or what structures are influenced by other varieties/languages? Do you know that very basic things in the structure probably are, given the evidence we have? How do you deal with the implications of mutually unintelligible Japanese dialects doing this to each other through their development? \n\nIn any case, as I said, for the most part, if you do this, you'll just sound alien. You may as well use your time to learn a Ryukyuan language or Tsugaru-ben and prank people by speaking it at them, or something. (\\s guys, don't get mad.) If you want to do this to sound neat while writing literature in Japanese, well, you'd best learn to speak normally to an extremely high level. Writers who use purism for purely artistic and not ideological reasons that are popular, tend to be so because they write in such a way which appeals to other speakers on a deep, emotional level, not because of their ideology or conlanging penchants. If you want to do this for fun, that's cool, have fun. \n\nI mean, it seems kinda boring to me, though. Like, if I were you, I'd rather just focus on learning the language. Then, you can read classical Japanese literature, or learn about the development of historical dialects, or regional pottery, or etc., you know, actually learning about the specific things that make each of these unique in terms of their intellectual milieu, worldview, history, the people. \n\nAnd if your intent is to spark a movement that'll get rid of English and Sinitic words in Japanese, well, good luck. \n\nand also finally, good luck actually deducing etymology and historical usage if you can't read good Japanese yet... most of the English resources for this are not very extensive or even good.\n\nEdit:\n\nThe bit at the end of the other wall of text isn't a value judgement or anything. Like, if you want to make this a conlanging project, go for it. If you want to learn to use old-timey language in an appealing way, go for it. You don't have to be into dusty old authors like me; read manga, do whatever. \nAlso, FWIW, I love etymology and looking at historical usage, so I don't think you're weird for being interested in that. It's more the arguments for liking purism. I was going to say, arguments that go beyond aesthetics, but... I suppose this is a matter of aesthetics. \n\nBut, look, there's a difference between a community creating new terms and stuff from native words, or at least words that are contemporaneously seen as native - which might not actually be native! and you'd probably overestimate natives' ability to notice or care - and having a movement around this, focused on doing exactly that (and maybe against political odds, say), and then some sole individual or group trying to push changes on people. As I said, there are solid reasons for people to 'do' 'purism,' I just don't think they're necessarily as you've put them. I also think 'purism' is a misnomer in any case.

Japanese has no demonstrable relations aside from Ryukyuan, but you must know that the language didn't stop and start with its written attestation. Languages aren't finitely definable things, our boundaries are largely based on ad hoc convenience. The whole idea of 'Japanese' as you understand it is mostly a modern construction; for sure it's built on historical ideas stretching back centuries, but for example there's good reason to believe that many dialects across the archipelago historically were essentially unintelligible, with these groups having unique local cultures. Or, in other words, the reason you think of this group as Japanese is the historical development of what are effectively power, economic, and cultural structures - simply put, it's sociopolitical, and your understanding of it doesn't map onto the experiences of those living historically. \n\nAnd, again, just because Japanese has no demonstrable relatives beyond Ryukyuan, does not mean it had no relatives. The language that came before would have been no different; loaning words from neighbouring languages, giving words, splitting off into new languages and dialects, etc. \n\nI'm not sure what ambiguity there is here; linguistic purism is irrational to the extent that, well, no language is pure, it's just for some, the dirt is so worn into them that you can't tell whether that's their natural colour, or discoloration. \n\nThis said, there is something to be said for purism as an expression of identity, or as an artistic thing. I don't think it's unreasonable for speakers of a small language to want to use native terms over English ones, for example. But, fwiw, prescription likely won't help, only individual choice will. \n\nAs for the latter, well art can serve goals; political, philosophical, etc. Or it can be just for fun. And here's the thing - I can point out to you your notion of pure Japanese is kinda contradictory here, but do you care? \n\nI mean, as well, if you go using native terms for everything, you're not going to sound 'old-timey,' you're not going to sound like Basho - you're just going to sound weird, probably alien, probably foreign, and if you're doing this without a really advanced understanding of the normal language, quite likely incomprehensible. You have to learn the game before you can break the rules. (I see a similar issue with people trying to write texts in 'modernised' old english - ie old english with all its case morphology, but with Germanic neologisms - where they basically just don't know the language well enough to be writing, well, anything, so instead of 'Old English with neologisms' you get this weird caricature that's borderline incomprehensible.) \n\nI mean, that can be fine, if you honestly don't care about that either. You do you. But don't expect Japanese people to be receptive to it. At such a point, you're basically conlanging - and, if you want to make an alternate history japan conlang, go right ahead dude. But, yeah, if it's providing you stress, and this is part of more general compulsive behaviour, you might want to speak to a doctor/counsellor/therapist. Best wishes, OP. \n\n(Also, you know, you read and write Japanese with a Sinitic script.)\n\nEdit: also, some languages prefer compounds, some prefer borrowing, some prefer multiword constructions.

Anyway, it's come to my attention that for Vovin disagrees with this, pointing out that in OJ you could have the gerundive (our \u3066 form) follow the perfective \u3066, ie. an inflection of the \u3064 auxiliary - so it seems they have different historical developments.

If you don't care about the grammar details and just want the usage details, skip to the end. I will put a line like this:\n\n\\-------\n\nSo, what's going on here? (A note on a word: inflection just means to change the form of the word to indicate different grammatical things. I run, I *ran*. That's inflection.)\n\nWell, let's talk about the regular -\u305f\u3044 form firstj. The \u307e\u3059 stem, as you call it, is a specific inflection of verbs/adjectives - now, we can try to characterise what this form/inflection 'means' in English in various ways by looking at its usage, but I think its easiest to gloss the name of this stem literally, and say it is the *stem that attaches to inflecting words*; a shorter name for this might be the conjunctive stem, but sometimes the \u3066 form is called the conjunctive form, and I don't want us to get confused. That it is the stem that inflected words attach to is the important takeaway here.\n\nWhat does that mean in practice?\n\nWell, let's take a verb in its \u307e\u3059 stem form, like \u6cf3\u304e(\u304a\u3088\u304e ) 'to swim.' What do we do with the verb in this form? Well, we can attach \u307e\u3059 for starters, \u6cf3\u304e\u307e\u3059 - masu can of course inflect, \u6cf3\u304e\u307e\u305b\u3093, \u6cf3\u304e\u307e\u305b\u3093\u3067\u3057\u305f, \u6cf3\u304e\u307e\u3057\u3087\u3046, etc. We can also attach \u305f\u3044, \u6cf3\u304e\u305f\u3044. \u305f\u3044 *also* inflects, fex. you can say \u6cf3\u304e\u305f\u304b\u3063\u305f 'wanted to swim,' \u6cf3\u304e\u305f\u304f\u306a\u304b\u3063\u305f 'did not want to swim,' etc. The key takeaway for this part is that words like \u305f\u3044, \u307e\u3059 themselves are inflectable words - *they* are attaching to the stem. And, in fact, if you have a string like \u6cf3\u304e\u305f\u304f\u306a\u3044, that -\u305f\u304f- part *is this same stem*, and *nai* is its own separate inflecting 'word.' So then in \u305f\u304f\u306a\u304b\u3063\u305f, what you actually have is \u305f\u3044 in this stem form, followed by \u306a\u3044 in this stem form (actually this is \u306a\u304f), followed by the past tense form of \u3042\u308b (it becomes \u306a\u304b\u3063\u305f instead of \u306a\u304f\u3042\u3063\u305f, this is a historical contraction like in English *can't*.) - that being \u3042\u3063\u305f. (\u3042\u308b also had a completely different inflection way back when, but it's not really important for us to break down \u3042\u3063\u305f.)\n\nSo, as you can see, it is called the stem that inflecting forms attach to for good reason.\n\nSo, the -\u3066 form. You've probably been essentially taught that the \u3066 form attaches to the \u307e\u3059 stem. So for \u6cf3\u304e we have \u6cf3\u3044\u3067 (there's a historical sound change here, originally this was likely \\*\u6cf3\u304e\u3066). Now, wait a minute, I hear you say, I thought the \u307e\u3059 stem was the 'stem that inflected words attach to.' Well, yes. And, historically, \u3066 is *exactly that*, another morpheme that inflected. But, that's not really important for us, instead, you can just think of \u3066 as a particle that follows this stem.\n\nIt might be worth pointing out here that our \u307e\u3059 stem behaves a lot like a noun, in that it can form compound words (so \u98df\u3079 -> \u98df\u3079\u6b8b\u3057 'leftovers') and have other verbs follow it, eg. \u98df\u3079\u3059\u304e\u308b. In contrast, the form that goes at the end of sentences (\u6cf3\u3050) and that you put before nouns (\u6cf3\u3050\u4eba 'swimming person') is a lot less noun-y, like if you want to make \u6cf3\u3050 the subject of a sentence, *normally* you have to nominalize it with \u306e or \u3053\u3068, so eg. \u6cf3\u3050\u306e\u306f\u3044\u3044\u3053\u3068\u3067\u3059\u3088 'to swim is good for you,' you can't just say \u304a\u3088\u3050\u306f... (I mean, you can, but this is really a topic for when you're a bit further along.) With \u6cf3\u304e, you can just use it without \u306e or \u3053\u3068, eg. '\u6cf3\u304e\u306f\u3042\u307e\u308a\u901f\u304f\u306a\u3044,' 'I'm not a very fast swimmer.'\n\nAnyway, back to \u3066. Your textbook/teacher/etc. should basically run you through the uses, but the [Wiktionary page](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E3%81%A6#Etymology_2) has a pretty good overview. For our purposes, we just want to break down \u3066\u3044\u305f\u3044. So, in a sequence like \u98df\u3079\u305f\u3044, what's going on? Well, we have our \u307e\u3059/inflecty-attach stem of \u98df\u3079\u308b, + the \u3066 particle, and then we have the \u307e\u3059/attach-y form of \u3044\u308b, followed by \u305f\u3044.\n\n\\----------\n\nSo, what we have are two parallel structures for expressing wanting to do something, we can take our examples as \u98df\u3079\u305f\u3044 and \u98df\u3079\u3066\u3044\u305f\u3044. Why have two/what's the difference? Well, remember, \u307e\u3059 stem + \u3066 + \u3044\u308b has a continuative meaning, it refers to ongoing events. So, when you say \u98df\u3079\u305f\u3044, you are just saying you want to eat; when you say \u98df\u3079\u3066\u3044\u305f\u3044, you're saying you want to be eating. The basic \u305f\u3044 construction without \u3044\u308b is far more common for the majority of verbs, with \u3066\u3044\u305f\u3044 having a more restricted set of uses - usually, it might imply that you were interrupted and you want to continue onwards with X, you might gloss this with 'keep on X-ing,' or it might mean the difference between wanting to do something at a certain point (2\u5e74\u3067\u5352\u696d\u3057\u305f\u3044; I want to graduate in two years) vs. by a certain point (eg. 2\u5e74\u3067\u5352\u696d\u3057\u3066\u3044\u305f\u3044 I want to have graduated by the time two years is up; 20\u4ee3\u3067\u77e5\u3063\u3066\u3044\u305f\u3044\u3001\u3068\u601d\u3046\u3053\u3068; things I wish I'd known in my 20s), or it might just refer to an action that you want to specifically be in a continual state of doing (eg. \u898b\u3064\u3081\u3066\u3044\u305f\u3044 - I want to stare, \u7b11\u3063\u3066\u3044\u305f\u3044 , I want to laugh, \u9045\u304f\u307e\u3067\u5bdd\u3066\u3044\u305f\u3044\u3067\u3059\u304b do you want to sleep late?.)\n\nEdit: u/SunsetinSomerset, I made a basic mistake in the post - think I'm confusing modern and historical grammar cos I've been up for like 24 hours; the correct \u3066 form of \u6cf3\u3050 is \u6cf3\u3044\u3067. For verbs like this with different \u307e\u3059 stems and \u3066 forms, like \u8aad\u3080 for example, the -\u3066 form is \u8aad\u3093\u3067 in modern Japanese, but in historical Japanese it was something more like \u3088\u307f\u3066 - ie. just the \u307e\u3059 stem + \u3066, there are a series of sound changes called euphony (\u97f3\u4fbf - \u304a\u3093\u3073\u3093) that led some verbs to have new forms, that's why we have \u6cf3\u3044\u3067 instead of \u6cf3\u304e\u3066, \u7f6e\u3044\u3066 instead of \u7f6e\u304d\u3066 etc. Note these euphonic changes had different outcomes dialectally/geographically, so you might hear different pronunciations, \u3088\u3046\u3067 for \u8aad\u3093\u3067 for example, depending on where in the country you go.

Changing one parameter can have results you might not expect for any given tea. Some teas are best brewed wildly, wildly different than you'd brew 'this tea that I think should be brewed like this other one based on experience because it's kinda similar in xyz terms of processing etc.' \n\nBroadly, one can be very precise with terminology, but making micro changes along one parameter isn't going to get you trying a range of stuff. In short, I've tried to approach changing parameters systematically and my end result was - I go by instinct, taste, creative whim, and I deliberately try to break out of habits and ignore conventional wisdom. This has gotten me some bad brews, but it's also gotten me a whole lot out of some teas. \n\nObviously if I don't have much of a tea, I'll play it safer. Anyway, partly why I do this is that, it you ask people how they brew X, and you keep the pool of people you're asking wide (different communities, who aren't just repeating the parameters that are the conventional wisdom of Y, people from different countries including the country where the tea is from, etc), you'll often get a lot of different answers. Sometimes you'll get a pretty consistent answer, but you'll disagree with everyone. \n\nHowever, I do regularly pester people about how they brew tea, precisely because they'll tell me to brew it in a way I wouldn't think of.

I was computer illiterate when I started using Linux, at least relative to many (maybe most?) of my generation (late 90's.) That first distro, aside from some bad antergos experiences, was Arch. I picked Arch at random, literally for no other reason (no, I'm not joking) than because of the tagline: keep it simple, stupid. Well, I thought, I'm both simple and pretty stupid, I'll give it a go! \n\nA good few years later, I've tried a lot of distros, from Fedora, to Ubuntu, to Debian, to Gentoo (also funtoo), to one (failed) LFS, to freeBSD (cough), to Mint, and uhhh, ah yeah - nixos and manjaro. (Also recently acquainted with MacOS, given I mentioned freeBSD. It does some specific things *really well*, I'll give it that. It's not Linux, though, and not my preference.) \n\nI don't think I'm a Linux veteran. I still post in newbie's corner on the forums. Yet, of all the things I've tried, unless you need accessibility as in 'someone else will admin this machine but I will use it day to day, because I literally don't know what a browser tab is,' Arch unironically gets my vote for best documented, most helpful community (even if they are short or downvote you sometimes!) and sanest distro with smoothest day-to-day experience. \n\nMy experience with Fedora is that it's 'basically' Arch, but ready out of the box (can be a pro and a con!), with less packages and slightly inferior documentation, but a lovely community. A lot of new software from big firms targets Fedora (as well as Ubuntu) if it targets a Linux distro, so there's that; and sure you can just compile from source anything you'd normally install via AUR. (But, you should be reading PKGBUILDs anyway, so...)\n\nMy experience with both Ubuntu and Fedora is that they're less stable than Arch (yes, really). I don't want to get into a flame war over that point, it's obvious to me that people have different experiences at this point with different distros wrt. stability and once an opinion has been formed, it tends not to change. \n\nYou can guess I wouldn't agree wrt out-of-box defaults for the most part. I simply don't see it as an issue, you install what you need, you know if you're missing it because it'll tell you... \n\nThe two big points I'll give you are scaling just working and nice gnome integration on Ubuntu. I don't use gnome, scaling is a bit of a faff. \n\nI don't mean to detract from your points about Ubuntu over Fedora, I actually think many of them hold up.

Rather they study how specific things help or hinder language acquisition. By their nature, it ends up the case that most of our *hard* answers are: (a) of applicability in limited contexts for limited tasks or aspects of acquisition, (b) are environmentally biased towards formal education.\n\n(Also, testing language ability at the macro or micro level is no simple task, and most of the tests that exist tell a limited and often indirect picture about proficiency.)\n\nAs such, most of the research is not really relevant for independent learners; instead it's relevant for teachers or the designers of programmes like the FSI, or the people setting up programmes for endangered languages. Yet, there are some clear trends (soft answers, if you will), that emerge, and some things we can say with confidence about specific aspects of learning - as an independent learner, you can be your own teacher, so-to-speak, and shape your learning environment.\n\nI wrote a previous comment some time ago [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/comments/s4gqdq/changes_in_the_mod_team/ht8lhql/?context=3) with a bibliography below it. I'm not very fond of the comment, I don't think it's charitable, I don't think it brings enough (read: really any) hard evidence to bear aside from the reference list, and overall I think it's a bit pompous. [Here](https://www.saint-david.net/uploads/1/0/4/3/10434103/how_languages_are_learned.pdf) (pdf, download at own risk) is a book I used when studying a class on all this (warning: much out of date, got good grades for ripping into it.) The crux is though, that the info in either probably *isn't* that helpful for you, rather the truth to language learning is half dark art and half common sense.\n\nYou need motivation, you need a *lot* of input, you need proficient-speaker interaction, different kinds of input can help in different ways (ie. i+1 - a slippery thing to define - is not always the most beneficial), interaction with peers can help, the form of i+1 input is important (implicit learning of grammatical form) - *some* explicit *instruction* is 'probably good' -, *implicit* 'feedback' is important (explicit *feedback*, ie. corrective feedback, is a contentious topic, I think with the majority learning against it - *but* anecdotally and without any data, it's very different a close friend correcting you, explaining why you're wrong, and giving you a load of examples, vs. a teacher trying to do the same thing for 30 people!); the list can go on and get variously more or less specific along its length - there are journals dedicated to this!\n\nMaybe critically eyeing statistics isn't a skill you have, but you could read through a few meta-analyses published in some of them - like [this one](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/229940242_The_Effectiveness_of_Corrective_Feedback_in_SLA_A_Meta-Analysis) from 2010, which is a bit old now. Or, another way is to pick up a research handbook, which will summarize angles of research in short but dense order; the con is that I don't know of any really *current* one, and they're all expensive. I haven't read the Blackwell's one, but it's the one I managed to find a link to a free pdf of, so you can have a flick through it if you'd like: [pdf link, download at own risk](https://vulms.vu.edu.pk/Courses/ENG504/Downloads/%5B%5D_The_Handbook_of_Second_Language_Acquisition(BookZZ.org).pdf) .\n\nIt would be easier to find out if some claim about something *harming* acquisition is bogus. Otherwise, if you're doing things in the language (input, interaction, output), doing some study, etc., and as long as you use some common sense in self-directing, you're probably implementing most of what we know of your own accord. And, for sure, that does need to involve *a lot of input* and *a lot of interaction* \\- I think people underestimate just how much if they learnt languages as a kid, or failed to learn one at school.\n\nThe FSI and military programmes (idk what country you're in) are good *hints* \\- 45-55 or so hours, for 88 weeks, half of that being in direct interaction with a fluent speaker, nets you B2/C1 (\\~N1-N1+), but I certainly don't think you should necessarily try to imitate or generalize those programmes - they work in their context, for a restricted sample, for a restricted goal of proficiency. It's unclear if any given practice or aspect of the routine in any one of these institutes (they vary!) is 'the best,' or if you can apply them with the same effect (or non-effect!), but when you're in those programmes you work full time until you graduate - the sheer amount of time is probably the main factor.\n\nI don't know if you maybe have more specific questions, but for example, I can't tell you how many hours you should listen or read a day. You'll have to figure that one out. Textbooks, tutors, teachers are all things that *can* help, but there's no saying any given single *instance* will. (Also, you can get native interaction other ways than teachers/tutors. My advice - if you join a learning community, try to avoid speaking English too much. Not because the native language in a learning environment is always bad, but because if it's a group where you go to chill etc. you'll just end up procrastinating.)\n\nIf I'm to offer any advice, it's to spend more time using or learning the language than worrying about learning methods, or the back-and-forth that takes place in learners' forums. To address one common theme, it's true, you don't need to learn a ton about the linguistics of X language to learn, but people who are claiming any use of a textbook is *that* self-evidently don't know what they're talking about. At the same time, you don't want to be stuck in forever-textbook land, at some point you need to graduate; and it's also very well true that some people have learned without them. Ultimately, you have to find what works for you here, and I think anyone who is trying convince you of a *method* is probably misguided for the simple fact that (if they're not a straight up conman) that we tend to anecdotally attribute significance to practices, routines, etc. to things that didn't actually cause or lead to this other thing.

OP, I don't want to put words to your feelings for you, but, reading your last paragraph, it comes across as the anxiety about this *being* the problem. You don't explicitly put your finger on the issue, other than the feeling of uncertainty that comes from your expectation about readings being contradicted. You learnt to spell English, and you got over the fact that Greco-Latin and French loanwords often completely ignore the more basic rules of pronunciation for words of Germanic origin. \n\nAs to how to fix it, it is to learn words, to read/listen/etc. and see them in context. As well as kunyomi vs. onyomi, you will have to deal with names using the same characters being different, and word-play that shows you the kanji for some other word(s) and supplies a totally different word in furigana, amongst other stuff. This may all seem overwhelming and disconcerting but - it comes. \n\nKanji study is not the be-all, end-all. Many here don't do it at all. I think there's certainly merit to learning them; there's a reason Japanese students learn them - chiefly, they come in handy for spelling queries (fex. you might want to clarify the kanji of someone's name), for writing, for frantically guessing meanings when you can't use a dictionary or ask someone (rare occurrence...), and finally (the most relevant for learners I think actually) it helps reduce ambiguity between very similar kanji. \n\nPersonally, I didn't think any of those points were worth the trade-off of the time investment while starting to learn, and I think words teach you the readings in a passive manner, so I focused on reading/etc. first, and *then* started to learn individual kanji in the sense of learning them outside of their existence as words. Because I know how kanji are read in maybe 1 or 2 words, I could easily guess at readings. If I knew a word vocally, but not visually, I could often run through the different possibilities for a given sequence of two kanji say, and figure out the word, especially given I'd vaguely have an impression of their meaning; all this goes on subconsciously. Confusing two similarly written words happens less than you think, for example cases where the kanji going one way means one thing and another the other, eg \u706b\u82b1 and \u82b1\u706b. When it does, you tend to quickly realize from context that you have the wrong word and need to look at a dictionary\u01c3\n\nAnd this is exactly the way Japanese children learn. They know the words; kanji slowly get introduced in reading, and at the same time, they do drills for them. They won't learn all the readings at once, rather they'll learn the most relevant readings. A few more readings and more kanji will be introduced as they progress. They have to write them out to practice handwriting, proportionality, etc. Eventually, the task of figuring out readings will be left up to them, and it's mostly expected that they will learn them by reading and writing. \n\nNow, I don't say you should switch your approach, if you're learning kanji, rather I am saying - don't worry about it too much.

Do you just refuse to submit a pull request? \n\nI wasn't suggesting you volunteer hours for Anki, rather I was saying if you could identify a bug easily (you have the machine with issues after all) and you figure out the cause (and hence probably the fix) in the code, it's probably a net return time-wise (and time is money) for you to just make the fix and submit it, rather than facing the issue again and again during your anki usage, demanding they fix it (when you already know the fix), or making your own app or maintaining your own fork.\n\nObviously you can't do this for the iOS app, cos it's closed source. You're also not getting any clear error messages, so it's unlikely in this case. But given that - as you seem frustrated with - basically noone else is having these issues, I don't think it's fair to say that this is 'beta stage issues.' It's far more likely an environmental issue on your machine,\u00b9 user-error, or a rare and uncaught error from an update. \n\n\u00b9 In which case you should thank your stars the desktop version is OS - have you tried to debug someone else's closed-source C++ app via week-long slow emails?

For German I think vocab cards would work well, but old habits die hard for me.\n\nShort term, I would probably focus on your vocab cards and drop the sentence deck, because of your exam. Long-term, I can't say if you should keep using the sentence deck or not - the trouble with those sentences is again that you don't know offhand what vocab is there; you'd be surprised how easy it is to go 10,000 more cards without even noticing if it is helping if you have a high new card rate. Making cards emergently with language use seems the most efficient to me.\n\nI will say, theoretically, it doesn't have to be that way; you can handcraft a deck sufficiently generalised that it will do most people a lot of good - there are some decks like this; but they're unfortunately kind of rare.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTwo hours review a day is pretty brutal.

Even if I assume say 30,000 max cards for a language, I sincerely think you would be better off in general spreading those out throughout a period longer than that one would traditionally study for (say 3 years) and simply engaging with the language more instead - not to put off the burden, but because it's more effiecient. \n\nYou mention you worry about forgetting things. This is both normal, and in large degree fine. See here on some relevant ideas applied to anki https://eshapard.github.io/anki/thoughts-on-a-new-algorithm-for-anki.html (there are papers on this applied to language acquisition, but I'm half asleep tbqh). \n\nYou mention you're unsure about card volume. This is partly why I recommend spreading cards out. You can easily accumulate 50,000-100,000 cards for a language, and learn most of them. Should you? Probably *not*. I have actually done something approaching this. If you just keep learning new cards, without using the language, particularly if you're not making these cards yourself and being critical about *each and every one*, you are fundamentally *wasting a ton of time* messing around with cards - time that you could be spending to actually engage with the language. (Sure, sure, anki can be 'engaging with the language,' but this would be like reading 5000 introductory textbooks for French before progressing to any other material, or something akin to that.)\n\nMore normal numbers will look something like 20,000 - 30,000, maybe 40,000 at a stretch, up through B2-C2, I would warrant, depending on the learner, the language's difficulty, the script of the language, based on my own anecdotal polling of people who are both good at their L2 and who have used anki prolifically. (Varies by language difficulty less than you'd expect.) \n\nAnd, sure, maybe you should frontload stuff because your exam will require you to explicitly know some vocabulary, but my advice, especially if you're on a deadline, is spend less time on anki and more time with other means of engagement. I'm not saying to give up the cards - anki is great - rather, if you really know most of your cards, like truly know them because they're basic vocab, *just delete them*. Only leave cards for vocabulary that is new to you, and even then IMO you shouldn't be looking at it as a card until you've met it in context at least once. I only make a card for words or constructions I have *just learnt,* ie. that I needed to look up, or words that were eg. false friends. (And some cards are surprisingly basic, sure.)

I have some of those aliases myself, or similar ones.", "created_utc": "1659456777.0", "edited": "False", "id": "iinr6bw", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_we84z4", "parent_id": "t1_iinbyqr", "score": "3", "subreddit": "commandline", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s4oq"}, {"author": "haelaeif", "body": "Yes, in theory. \n\nIn practice, as well, it does happen that releases, binaries especially but sometimes also source, has malicious code inside. \n\n You should probably be asking yourself though, how Iikely this is. (And maybe how likely it is relative to other vulnerabilities, to help you better secure your system for your use-case.) \n\nYou're on a browser; I'd say that code injection via that is much more likely than finding malicious code in these tools. For sure, the chance is there. \n\nI'm not sure how you use your system, but if you already use a repository for packages that extend the systems core repositories, you're already taking the same level of risk, maybe just a tiny bit less (as user repositories will tend to receive a lot of traffic, hence a lot of eyes on code.) \n\nIf it's binaries, though, really all you have is trust up until such a time as something goes wrong, though there are some measures in place to make it harder for you to receive something unexpected. (You can read PKGBUILDS or your distros equivalent, for example, files can be checked with hashes.) \n\nFor from-source stuff in user repos, the risk is a bit lower, because you (and other people, but you shouldn't expect them to do it for you) can go read the source. A FOSS program distributed in a binary is also less reliable (remember point about hashing above, though) for this reason; especially if that binary is in any way from a non-official source, because this means that whoever is compiling that binary can put whatever they want in it. (There is a risk of someone making you think you're getting the official binary somehow, but giving you something else, but as I said there are usually - you could probably check - things in place to help guard against this.) \n\nMost of this, then, comes down to trade offs of transparency, convenience, and a web of trust. \n\nIn regards to realistic levels of threat to the average user - and bear in mind that, contrary to intuitions, *most users are not the average* I would make the following general points:\n\n- Your biggest security vulnerability is most likely your browser, where biggest is roughly equivalent to ease of exploitation, number of people wanting to exploit it, average resources needed to exploit, and the likelihood of unsuspecting user error. \n\n- If you use any proprietary software, this is at a higher risk of containing malicious code. And - I would add - just because a piece of software has widespread user or business adoption, does not mean it doesn't contain malicious code that is either dormant or running without you knowing it. \n\n- As a corollary, there exists on most computers today some subset of code that is proprietary and close to the hardware, that you will likely never be able to remove or change. There are usually reasonable measures in place to stop 'just anyone' exploiting this, and often an exploit at this level can be 'checkmated' by some higher-level security, but (a) sometimes these things go unnoticed and unpatched for a long time, and (b) in this domain it is primarily those actors that are not 'just anyone' that is the cause of concern. While there's an argument that most users are not dealing with a threat model that includes this kind of people, I think this argument is essentially short-sighted appeasement. \n\n- I think my points about FOSS software above probably hint why it is better, and why one should probably be less concerned (but still cautious with) using these tools mentioned here, but I wanted to make an addendum point. This is that, if people are wanting to put malicious code into your system via a FOSS project, a small command line utility is a pretty bad choice, because they're typically compiled from source and consist of a few hundred lines of code that anyone can read. Further, because they're CLI tools, they are pitched to users who are very likely to actually read that code (relatively), as well as to change it and contribute fixes for security issues themselves, or to spread the word if the software is malicious. No - usually, when people want to distribute malicious code in FOSS software, they target huge projects with enormous code bases, and they will hide the code somewhere in there, alongside commits that are actual contributions, so as to not set off red flags. As it is FOSS, it's more likely someone will pick up on this, but it does happen. The best defence is to avoid projects with large numbers of dependencies where possible. But, if you're using proprietary blobs - you should probably look to getting rid of those, first.

Immigrants are statistically more likely to start businesses, they create jobs and are a net benefit. They also have more kids than national average. This said, we probably shouldn't frame immigration in purely economic terms, as it is fundamentally a social phenomenon. \n\nIn that light, we need to focus on making the system well oriented for immigrants; this is easier for well educated people in critical industries; harder for those that are not (see Sweden's recent experiences.) \n\nBut mostly this is an issue of broader policy change to make life and integration easier for these people, policies that broadly will affect and benefit poorer Britons as well. (We also might want to re-examine our understanding of integration, it's not clear that pursuing a model of cultural conversion or whatever is beneficial or nthat this is ecessary to have them accept British values or various liberal social positions that most of us might support, like a social net, access to abortion, etc) \n\nCare itself is going to become one of the UK's largest employers.

How many employers of late has one heard whining that they just can't find the people?

You simply have to learn to use it in a different manner.\n\nRereading is a relatively ineffective study strategy. Still, many successful people I know do this. In fact it's the norm in academia - you target specific parts, decide if more parts are worth your time. If so, you reread again, reading more. Then you may read the whole thing. If it's a text you are using extensively, you'll reread it once or even twice more, making notes. If it's even more important than that, ie. it's a foundational text in the field, you'll read it even more, make notes that go beyond summary, ie. criticizing it. Beyond that, you'll maybe write up a review.\n\nBut for revising for a test it is not very effective. Most academics make most of those notes for reference, *not for memorisation* and broadly not really for learning. They're so that they can find what paper made X claim again. The more elaborate notes are part of *synthesis*, not learning as-such, ie. elaboration. Synthesis can for sure help you learn/memorize, but by the time you're doing that you usually know the material well anyway. In any case, nobody writes super elaborate notes for every paper they read because it's simply undoable. Most of the time, you won't even read half of half the papers you read, you'll just look at abstracts.\n\nSummary notes are only marginally more useful than rereading. While there are some studies that show it is statistically significant, as far as I remember several meta-reviews say that it isn't significant for test performance, though there is a correlation.\n\nWhat is statistically significant? Self-testing. Either by making questions yourself, someone else making the questions, or in combination with note-making and/or synthesis as well as questions you've made (the latter seems the most effective, but most time-intensive).\n\nYou can self-test by having yourself answer open-ended questions, suree. You can also ask yourself atomic questions and drill them with Anki. Ideally you should do both open-ended and atomic, as well as regular practice exercises if this is relevant for your field (also try to find the real-world equivalent of problem sets and apply your knowleddge.) How much of all this you do depends on the kind of test, what you actually need to know, etc.\n\nWhen making atomic questions, you really want to keep to a few principles:\n\n* Make sure they are atomic. Ie. they ask you one thing, that is short.\n* Avoid making orphan cards. You must always enter some other cardss related to a given card, by topic.\n* Avoid making cards that only go one way. Write other questions that ask the inverse of your question, or ask you to reproduce the question and the result by induction (fex. what is the command to go from X -> Y, without necessarily stating what the process is called, and then you can have other cards asking you what the process is called, another asking you what is the command for Y process, another asking for where you would use Y process or asking you which process is appropriate for a given problem, etc, etc)\n* Make cards of anything that it seems worth taking 5 minutes to learn.\n* Do not stop reviewing cards after your test. Only remove cards if they are bad cards.\n\nFinally, learn to read texts incrementally, in a way analogous to how you might make different kinds of notes on your first, second, third or fourth pass of a text - only here you are making Anki cards as well. On your first or second pass you really need to make sure you fill in gaps in knowledge, ie. ask any questions that you need to to get to grips with a given paper. Go find out that stuff, from other papers, textbooks, etc. As well, by your second or third pass, you might want to consider starting to read other papers from the references in the paper, particularly if you've seen them cited by other literature of they have a high citation count.\n\nMost of this can be adapted to other fields where you aren't reading academic papers, or if you're before that part of your studies in a given area.\n\nFor me, I could never get into Zettelkasten type notes. Instead what I go for is brief notes in a reference manager for papers, more elaborate summary notes in a text editor or LaTeX for stuff I need to know fairly well (as well as synthesis texts full of my own comments, reviews, annotated bibliographies, etc. for stuff I really need to know) and then finally Anki cards. I also reread, and add more cards or notes. Paper notes are probably preferable, but I have a visual impairment and have been typing since I was 7, so I go for the avoidance of migraines over better retention.\n\nI definitely do all of these things in different degrees. Some things only get a Zotero note, some things only get notes in summary docs or synthesis docs, some things only get Anki notes, and then every combination of those (2 of them, all three). Some summary docs are very brief, others are very in-depth. Usually open-ended questions get saved for if I need to speak or write about something. Problem sets (or projects) are something you should just be doing anyway, if relevant. Also - sometimes I just read stuff like they're regular books. No harm in that. Sometimes that sticks better than all the other stuff - but you can't rely on it as a *study* technique. Rather, it's a happy accident of reading beyond the essential readings for fun (or reading the essential readings again for fun!)\n\nYou can't do all of this for everything. Learning how to prioritise and when to do what has as steep a learning curve (if not more) as learning to use Anki for learning (as opposed to rehearsal) does. Mostly this means you have to be a time-management wizard, especially if you're working alongside studies.\n\nIn some countries exams proceed such that you are given the exam questions the same day, and you answer them in front of a board of professors, and they can also ask you completely random questions, and you get graded based on your understanding. One can debate whether or not this is superior to western style exams or to western coursework (coursework is usually open book essay writing or it involves practical work; the latter isn't really relevant here) with such practices as anonymised reviewing (a downside is that a professor won't be able to mentor you unless you share your essay with them afterwards; you have to rely on the comments of an anonymous reviewer). But, what this method does do, is ensure you know your shit at least to the degree you can talk about it. This is similar to the Feymann technique, without the requirement for making Wittgensteinian ladders (ie. because Feymann technique involves teaching it to a young person or non-specialist, where some nuance is usually always lost.) You could do both, pitch your arguments/topics to your friends in different areas, and engage in more nuanced arguments (or problem-set olympics or co-projects) with people in your field.\n\nAnother thing that I think helps is doing reading before classes (I don't know if you're a student but you can translate the concept to non-student contexts). Lectures are review and elaboration. Seminars are for you to discuss and engage; you should be able to critique the literature, accept or reject its assumptions, work out any given problem sets (and do not be reticent to go beyond the scope of the original question to show things that necessarily follow on, or to ask other questions, just keep it relevant. You'll probably feel self-conscious, but by doing all this you're also helping other people learn. Would you rather be in a seminar where noone does this, or a seminar full of people asking pertinent questions?) In undergrad seminars will be bogged down by a lot of people frankly not being interested, not really knowing or caring to know the subject, etc. Ignore them, weedle out the people who give a hoot. You can also teach people who do give a hoot, but who are struggling. They will probably be able to return the favour in some other class.\n\nIn terms of learning how to read academic papers, if you search on google for how to read them + reddit, there's plenty of advice from PhD students from a myriad of fields.

(Even those who are quite loud at apparently believing the opposite, you can usually catch them asserting the contrary for specific cases.) \n\nMost of the cases I have a hunch about fall out from psycholinguistic studies as opposed to information-theoretic considerations, though; this is a fall-out of the fact that my undergrad studies were in linguistics, with no math, CS, etc. and that didn't take syntax beyond G&B (and that not to a sufficient degree of depth as well, we essentially drew some trees and debated c-command without really getting into the *justification* for arguing about those things and the associated analyses in the first place.)\n\nThis particular aspect of Chomsky's (and other people's) theories of grammar is relatively new to me as such, so I both haven't had time to think things through, nor have a good grasp of fundamentals to inform said thinking. \n\nIn any case, I don't disagree with your point about needing to posit a specialised UG in the case of child-language acquisition. I also agree that this was Chomsky's intent - even way before Minimalism, he makes his motivations very clear in LSLT and SS. \n\nBut I think I disagree with his readings of NNs and, relatedly, the post-Bloomfieldian structuralists. In the first instance, it's not because I think that NNs are particularly analogous to children (children do not reason in the same way as NNs at all!), but because I think that having good models is a step forward, and formal probabilistic models are an extremely helpful *tool* (there are other tools!) in our approach to that.\n\nI think it's a mistake to understand NNs as modelling language acquisition understood as statistical learning - in fact I think this approach is barking up the wrong tree, even if we may incidentally learn some things from it (arguably it was this that led linguists to note the existence of implicit evidence children were actually using, as opposed to the corrective feedback horse). Rather, they can be used to assess whether a given structural analysis seems likely given the data, or to try to make predictions about human neural responses, or to aid us in reasoning *about* a theory of grammar (they are not the theory itself.)\n\nBut you still have to do the leg work in figuring out what to test in this way, and you have to be very careful in regards to what you conclude from results gained in this manner. Hence why we narrow down the problem explicitly *in this case* to the data, and why we don't include considerations about acquisition or so on.\n\nI think this (and the post-Bloomfieldians) is overall approaching a distinct problem from a consideration of the mental structure of language acquirers, and it ***may*** turn out to be necessary for proper consideration of that problem. \n\nInstead of considering information as a *transmission* between sender-and-receiver, this is an approach that considers 'information' (and perhaps there is a better term here, such as structure) to be independent of speaker-hearer situated semantics/pragmatics and only indirectly correlated to it (but it *is* correlated). This is to say - the information (or structure if you prefer) contained within language can only be characterised by language. As such, the only way you can get at it is by examining the departures from equiprobability within the language itself, and explicitly stating those rules that hold for the language; you can call this distributional analysis, or you can call it constituent analysis (it's the same to me, maybe not to Chomsky). \n\nThat we use symbols to do this is no issue - the issue comes when we devise a symbolic language with explicitly defined meanings, and then characterise a new or unknown given language with it - because we have no *a priori* way to determine the structures in the target-language, all we would be doing is providing an *imprecise* *gloss* of the language's structure that is ultimately hinged upon our original symbolic language (and its underlying natural language\\[s\\]). It's more than likely that the most basic (ie. the 'core' grammatical) generalisations about English hold for Warlpiri - sure, I don't deny that, I am pretty firmly in the anti-Sapir Whorf camp. But we need to actually show that first, imo, rather than running amok with abductive hypotheses.\n\nWhere does that leave the methods I mentioned above? The charge historically is that they are discovery procedures for grammars or that they are only about surface structure - that proponents are under the impression that using these methods alone we can somehow arrive at a grammar (and potentially a theory of grammar). But that is not what they are. Rather, they are a loose formalisation of descriptive processes that are above all formalised only for the end of ensuring that the results of descriptions adhere to a criteria of justifiability. A theory of natural-language grammar, grammars, or Grammar is not on a very good footing until we can describe languages without language-external imposition, in this view - ie. descriptive adequacy is prior to good explanatory adequacy (though we can make a start on the latter at any point). \n\nMachines will not depart from the given formalisation of the processes and are fed constrained input - but linguists *will*, and moreover they *must do so* for the enterprise to be successful at all (and that is OK - NNs and the like are just tools.) These departures can be thought of as shortcuts, abductive leaps, and are what I see taking the place of the types of hypotheses that we saw in eg. the P&P program, but the scope of these hypotheses will be greatly constrained, and hence we can better test them (especially with modern Bayesian modelling). \n\nThe process proceeds quite differently from our formal statements of the processes; linguists rely on other languages, they change their analysis, they entertain multiple hypotheses, they make best guesses - they use subjective intuition (the horror!) \n\nWhile we have some formal means to assess the justifiability of a given description, ultimately the analysis in question will still hinge upon what we actually want to do with our description, and it is likely that the best given description for some end is not the best given description for some other end. \n\nThere is an objection to be made here - that statements of the regularities in structure themselves do not account for the data (that it fails on grounds of explanatory adequacy), we must of course write a grammar. This objection would state that we must constrain our theory of grammar *a priori* so that we avoid post-hoc doctoring of our theory.\n\nBut, in my view, such an interpretation of the distributional data and of any surface-level facts revealed about structure in the process of examining it (here I mean hierarchical structure or structure characterised by constraints or something like this) *must* be post-hoc; it is precisely this that avoids the doctoring. \n\nI think by working to higher levels of abstraction given this approach, even with non-uniqueness and assumed non-psychological realism, that you will arrive at a theory that allows us to very closely examine what we may want to postulate as our UG. \n\nIn short, my view is to take a different route with the same end; I don't at present buy eg. Chomsky or Adger's pitch that their route is better, but earnestly - that's great. Beyond this, I am sceptical that fex. the suggestion of Merge follows these principles, or that it would fall out from following them; but I am open to it being the case and as you guessed in your other comment, I am a bit out-of-date on contemporary discussions. I didn't mean to sound antagonistic before. \n\nI do hope I can be convinced by reading their work more about their methodology, as well.\n\nAnd finally, even if all of the above doesn't hold for the stated ends, I do think probabilistic models have shown great strength in studying specific things - just because people are interested in a specific question and a given tool cannot be used for scientific study of *that* question, I do not think that this means that the same tool cannot be used by people interested in fundamentally different questions.", "created_utc": "1657666014.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ifx2y7u", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_vvkmf1", "parent_id": "t1_ifp9hwg", "score": "1", "subreddit": "MachineLearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r3gv"}, {"author": "haelaeif", "body": "> if it does at all\n\nIff. it does, I'd say they'd likely be functionally equivalent. Language device X and Y may have different priors, but one would assume that device X could emulate device Y's prior and vice versa. \n\nI'm sceptical that LLMs are working in a way equivalent to humans; at the same time, I see no reason to assume the specific hypotheses made in generative theories of grammar hold for UG. Rather, I think testing the probability of grammars given a hypothesis and data is the most productive approach, where the prior in this case is hypothesised structure and the probability is the probability the grammar assigns to the data (and then we will always prefer the simplest grammar given two equivalent options). \n\nThis allows us to directly infer if there is more/less structure there. Given such structure, I don't think we should jump to physicalist conclusions; I think that better comes from psycholinguistic evidence. Traditional linguistic analysis and theorising must inform the hypothesised grammars, but using probabilistic models and checking them against natural data gives us an iterative process to improve our analyses.", "created_utc": "1657508332.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ifode8m", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_vvkmf1", "parent_id": "t1_ifnarqn", "score": "2", "subreddit": "MachineLearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r3gv"}, {"author": "haelaeif", "body": "I'm not sure how one would go about assessing that, generativist has a lot of meanings at this point and a the majority of them do not apply to the whole group. As well, I don't think every 'generativist' would agree with Chomsky's comments here nor with the form of the PoS as put forth by Chomsky. \n\nAlso, for what it's worth, I think that most of the criticism of the PoS in linguistics thoroughly misses the mark, much of it simply being repetitions of criticisms of Gold's theorem that fail to hold water, because they circle around the ideas of corrective feedback (historically at least, now we know there are many sources of negative input!), questions about the form of representations (implicit physicalism and universality, ie. children could have multiple grammars and/or modify them over time), and questions about whether grammar is generative at all as opposed to a purely descriptive set of constraints that only partially describe a set of language (this last one bearing the most weight, but it is mostly a somewhat meta-point that won't convert anyone in the opposite camp). For most of these you can extend Gold's theorem and write proofs for them. \n\nThe correct criticism is just as LLVMs have shown: there is no reason to assume that children cannot leverage negative feedback (and much evidence to suggest they do, contrary to earlier literature), which means that we aren't dealing with a learnability/identification situation to which Gold's theorem applies. Much of the remaining cases that seem to be difficult to acquire (in syntax at least) from input alone can benefit from iterative inductive(/abductive) processes and tend to occur in highly contextualised situations where, arguably, PoS doesn't apply, all else considered. (I think there is an argument to be made that something underlying some aspects of phonological acquisition is innate, but it's not really my area of expertise, this wouldn't invalidate the broader points, and whatever's being leveraged isn't necessarily specific to linguistic cognition.)\n\nThere's of course another, slightly deeper grounds to criticize the whole enterprise on, that being a rejection of the approach taken to the problem of induction. Said approach takes encouragement from Gold's theorem to suggest that the class of languages specified by UG is more restricted than historically thought, and hence it offers a restricted set of hypotheses (grammars) and simply hopes that only one amongst these hypotheses will be consistent with the data. \n\nThe trouble with this approach is that it leads to an endless amount of acceptable abstraction, without any recourse to assess whether said abstractions are justified by the data. Generativists will say that much of this notation is simply a stand-in for later, better, more accurate notation, and that its usage is justified by an appeal to explanatory power. They will usually say that criticisms of these assumptions miss the point: we don't want to just look at the language data at hand, we also want to look at a diverse range of data from acquisition, other languages, etc. and leverage this for explanatory power. Or, in other words, discussion stalls, because noone agrees on the relevant data. \n\nAn alternative approach, one I think would be more fruitful and one that the ML community (and linguists working on ML) seems to be taking, is to restrict our data (rather than our hypothesis), for the immediate purposes (ie. making grammars), to linguistic data. (Obviously we can look at other data to discuss stuff like language processing.) Having done this, our problem becomes clearer: we want a grammar that assigns a probability of 1 to our naturally-encountered data. Of course, we lack such a grammar (see Chomsky's SS, LSLT). Again, thinking probabilistically, we want the most probable grammar, which will be the grammar that is the simplest in algorithmic terms and that assigns the most probability to our data. We can do the same again for a theory of grammar. \n\nIn other words, what I am suggesting, is that we cast off the assumption of abduction-by-innate-knowledge (which seems less and less likely to provide an explanation in any of the given casses I know of as time goes on and as more empirical results come in) and assume that what we are talking about is essentially a task-general Turing machine. Our 'universal grammar' in this case is essentially a compiler allowing us to write grammars. (There is some expansion one could do about multiple universal TMs, but I don't think it's important for the basic picture).\n\nIn this approach, we solve both of our problems with the other approach. We have a means to assess how well the hypothesis accounts for the data, and we have a means for iteratively selecting the most probable of future hypotheses. \n\nBeyond this, there is great value in qualitative and descriptive (non-ML) work in linguistics, as well as traditional analysis and grammar writing (which can also broadly follow the principles outlined here) - they reinforce each other (and can answer questions the other can't). In terms of rules-based approaches like that we know from generativism (and model-theoretic approaches from other schools, etc., etc.), I do think these have their place (and can help offer us hypotheses about psycholinguistics, say), but that this place can only be fulfilled happily in a world where we don't take physicalism of notation for granted.", "created_utc": "1657505811.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ifo8atn", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_vvkmf1", "parent_id": "t1_iflibyi", "score": "4", "subreddit": "MachineLearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r3gv"}, {"author": "haelaeif", "body": "Depends on \n\n- the language (simple example, though there are other ways: languages which use large amounts of derivational morphology will probably require less words over a language wirh a lot of loanwords, excluding technical language where there's probably no great difference)\n\n- what you mean by word (NB: thorny issue in linguistics, which isn't relevant except for the fact that you can end up with quite different numbers for word count),\n\n- the sentences you're filling blanks in, the broader context individual sentences are occuring in,\n\n- etc.\n\nEven for languages where all these things are well defined and this has been studied, those studies come up with quite different numbers, but that also doesn't take account of my point about individual sentences, context, medium, and the semantic/functional domain of the text, variation of which could plausibly make the likely number range from anywhere to 10 to 15,000+.", "created_utc": "1657375548.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ifh3ztx", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_vv1mav", "parent_id": "t3_vv1mav", "score": "6", "subreddit": "Anki", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s9lm"}, {"author": "haelaeif", "body": "My perspective: people don't and won't care. \n\nSome issue will come up now and then where they'll pretend to care (about foss, privacy, essential human rights like freedom of speech or association - including for private companies -) but - they. do. not. care. \n\nIf someone cares, they'll learn themselves. (And ask questions of their own initiative.)\n\nWhat is it best to do, then? \n\nIMO, you just use software in your daily life. I earnestly believe that most FOSS software is better. Where it isn't, you have to consider the trade offs for yourself, your company,  eg. convenience or profitability vs your principles. Some people will be more dogmatic than others; i use plenty of proprietary software because it''s better, more convenient, or there are a lack of alternatives, up to the point where I can justify doing so against my conscience. Others are hard-line and will not do so at all in their daily lives. That's ok and good. \n\nAnd sometimes people who also support FOSS will still make an CSS app or have it OS but ask for money. This is also ok. Some of these apps are really good. But ultimately it's my personal belief that FOSS or OSS + donation for official (non-source) distribution will be the business model that wins out, eventually. \n\nI don't use most of my FOSS software because it's FOSS. I use most of it because it's better. That it's FOSS is both coincidental, and often, a large factor as to why it is better. If there is a proprietary app and a FOSS app of the same quality, obviously I am going to use the app that respects me and my beliefs about privacy etc. (But also, I believe the development will likely go better, though this also means that developers need to be able to afford to eat.) \n\nIt's my opinion that the market will take care of the rest, and that the economic pressures in software simply aren't the same as in, say, the semiconductor or automobile industry. But I am no economist.\n\nEdit: I see you mention hardware. That's more problematic, if you want to make it, as for that, you'll need capital, whether you want it to be proprietary (to protect it from abuse/competitors, which I think there is more of an argument for in hardware), or whether you want it to be OSS but to sell the physical product yourself.\n\n(See what I said about official, non-source software distribution; the hardware equivalent is having all the specification needed to make the thing hosted FOSS, and then to charge a small fee to make and sell the physical item. See the open source publishing model - you can run the typesetting code or read the pdf, you could even print and bind the book yourself if you want, or, you could send them some money and they'll have it printed via a print in demand service. This is harder with tech hardware. \n\nPrint is a very generalised process, and it also assumes individuals and their supporting community can typeset + edit books, which are the two reasons academic presses like Brill charge so much for books - the unit production cost is a tiny fraction of the costs associated with the book, and even charging $50+ per book, many books are not or barely profitable. The industry assumes academics can't edit/typeset, something that is largely an untrue assumption in any tech or STEM oriented field these days.)\n\nEdit 2: formatting might be easier to read now.", "created_utc": "1657373941.0", "edited": "1657374863.0", "id": "ifh0soq", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_vugke5", "parent_id": "t3_vugke5", "score": "1", "subreddit": "opensource", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh4n"}, {"author": "haelaeif", "body": "As others said, graded readers. \n\nBeyond that, not all textbooks are equal.

Other times I will put it in a big pot, lower ratio, and just refill that. And then other times I will do a more western gongfu, with quick steeps.

I know that more intake than exhaust is usually better, but if I want to add 1 or 2 top fans (or maybe one of those long, slim case fans) on the top (ie. top of case, not top of front panel), would I be expecting better results with intake or exhaust?\n\nI know generally more intake than exhaust is better, but I'm not sure if I should put one as exhaust, given how cramped things are in there. But - I am also worried about dust with that... I suppose that I will have to test and that actually both might just add noise for no return, and that there isn't a good answer; if the case were larger and there was a side intake the answer would be more obvious.", "created_utc": "1643672930.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hv2aul9", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_sgsvet", "parent_id": "t3_sgsvet", "score": "1", "subreddit": "buildapc", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rnve"}, {"author": "haelaeif", "body": "> most languages except English use genders for every noun.

First, if you go by official languages, that is languages as defined by states or by 'common sense' convention, you could cheat quite easily here by learning a number of languages that are legally separated because of sociopolitical mores but that aren't actually particularly different - an example of this is the Scandinavian languages, or Dutch vs. Low German, or, if you want to be cheeky, you could even write the same particular dialect of Urdu or Hindi in the other's script (yes I'm aware some speakers of Hindustani or Urdu might speak a dialect completely unintelligible to others here, this is kind of my underlying thrust with this - languages are ultimately defined by social criteria and not linguistic criteria, and to the extent that you can use either [the latter is contentious; most linguists would say you cannot know linguistic criteria, a number of my old lecturers have written works trying to contest that consesus] nobody really listens to the linguists when they're trying to get people linguistic rights or pointing out that there is a dialect continuum rather than two cookie cutter platonic ideals of languages that stop and start exactly at the national border.) \n\nBut then you go on mentioning other things, like job opportunity, or people reached. These are very different metrics. \n\nBasically, if you could clarify what direction you actually want to go with this (most people reached, most likely economic return, most likely academic return in a given field, simply the number of official language badges you can wave around in your status on a language learning forum, etc.) maybe we can figure out a conjectural answer that retains some cohesion. If you want us to consider multiple, that's cool too, but they ought to be considered separately. \n\n-------\n\nIn terms of some of your other stuff here; German and French can be argued to be roughly equivalent, in terms of economic utility, I would say, but it really depends on your field. They have roughly the same number of native speakers, but iirc French has a higher number of second-language speakers, and a greater geographical depth. German is undeniably the better choice for people in most academic fields though - obviously it depends on your field, but I find myself seeing German as the language of publication in everything from CS to sociology to history to linguistics more often than French. I can read German fine, French is a bit more of a struggle for me, but my level in both (passively) is such that accessibility is not really an issue to my anecdote. (Though that does raise another issue in my head - what do you mean by proficiency anyway?) \n\nFrench, however, offers an entry point into the other Romance languages, which German doesn't. \n\n> (150~300 additional hours for fluency\n\nAlthough this is about right, you have to consider that the only place with real statistics on this that are meaningful are military and diplomatic education programmes that have a very different medium of education than most language learners or degree students will have access to. It is unclear if intensity effects this, and I would say that it is very hard to measure how much exposure or study a regular person has had. (Also, sometimes you see biases when looking at this on a large scale. For example, it is not always the case that speakers of a more distantly related language will have more difficulty than speakers of X related language [say Hindi vs. Dutch], but a quantitative study may give this impression. Instead, there may be unexamined variables, like mode of education, economic background\u0119 etc.)\n\n-------------\n\nIn terms of your picks at face value though, I'd say you should pick Portuguese after Spanish - there's a difference between 'being able to navigate a restaurant/train station/etc' and 'being able to hold a free-flowing conversation.' Then yes, up to Hindi, and then probably I would pick a Dravidian language; a significant portion of the population won't speak English or Hindi. But other good choices would be Bahasa Indonesia or Javanese, Vietnamese, etc. I would say Mandarin would end up being about as equivalent in terms of arbitrary penetration metric as these or Hindi notwithstanding the time required to learn it; you get access to a huge native population, a fast increasing population of second-language speakers, as well as the ability to communicate in written form with a large number of people who may not have that good a grasp of spoken standard Mandarin (they may speak another language closely related to Mandarin [usually included under the term Mandarin I mean - many Mandarin lects are unintelligible with the standard you'd learn] or not at all.) It's also a common business language throughout SE Asia, and a good chunk of people you meet in big cities, especially those with close ties to the Chinese govt., will know at least enough to communicate with visitors. \n\nBut like, will you ever acquire all these? I've known some people who have good proficiency in a lot of languages - usually gained via it basically being necessary for their research and also enabled by that same position in research [yes wouldn't you know it's hard to learn a language working 12 hour shifts in a warehouse] - and four languages like the set here certainly isn't that weird. But amongst language learning hobbyists? Honestly often they struggle with one closely related language. (This isn't a value judgement of them.)

This is the case for almost every intelligent, well-adjusted adult I know of - they are complete dolts in regards to very basic aspects of life and the world. \n\nWhat distinguishes them from the average less well-adjusted citizen is usually (1) achievement or ability in their field, (2) their attitude towards not knowing these basic things. \n\nSure, it can be a bit funny when someone can't figure out how to operate the coin machine in an old washer, but only an idiot rips into someone for not knowing that, or excel, for even something basic like not knowing if Japan has a king, or so on.\n\nThe ill-adjusted will make it apparent they wouldn't welcome being leveled with hours before you think of trying, the well-adjusted take well to you leveling with you, even if they're not convinced or see how to do something immediately. Some people will double down on questionable or openly crackpot positions. Some will come back to you months later, saying you know what, I was wrong, I was being irrational (they're human, too). This applied to knowledge or skills, again.\n\nI only think badly of someone if they're basically as ignorant as can be, have no interest in changing that or actively stoke that fire, and refuse to be levelled with because they speak the revealed truth (often these people will go out of their way to shit all over people as well, for basic gaps in their knowledge). Some of these people are 'well-adjusted' societally, in that they have a good job, family, etc, but I'd hardly say they're well-adjusted citizens (in a more philosophical sense), but equally as many I've known are literally drug-dependent dropouts prone to violence and suchlike, and everywhere in between.

Most people in more prosaic academia don't memorise all the things, they figure out where they can find the things, and this skill is buildable for domain general skills and knowledge alike (tinkering with electronics or mechanical devices, knowing where to find basic info on the pre-war political debates about economic policy in Japan, knowing where to find the syntax for a pandas command, about the metre used by Dante, how to tend to various species of plant, basic plumbing, etc.)", "created_utc": "1642631587.0", "edited": "1642697881.0", "id": "htdp947", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_s7nq6u", "parent_id": "t3_s7nq6u", "score": "2", "subreddit": "slatestarcodex", "subreddit_id": "t5_30m6u"}, {"author": "haelaeif", "body": "Edit: Formatting. \n\nAlc\u00f3n Soler, E. and M.

These are the input hypothesis, the monitor hypothesis, the affective filter hypothesis, the natural order hypothesis, and the acquisition hypothesis. All of these, broadly speaking, have holes in them, as well as the broader model (the input hypothesis model) both empirically and theoretically, to different degrees. In the latter sense, theoretically, the issues are mostly about the specific framing, they being too vague or untestable, framed in a way that no longer makes sense given other empirical findings or theory, etc. But this goes both for those of these hypotheses that are basically dead and buried, as much as it does for those hypotheses that have living offshoots - but to the otherwise disinterested, it probably would seem that some of the hypotheses are 'basically correct to some extent with modification,' even though we would say they're untenable. We can say this for example about the Natural Order hypothesis and the Monitor hypothesis, which both have living offshoots, but that both are basically untenable (especially the Natural Order hypothesis) in the form originally put forward by Krashen. \n\nTo focus on the input hypothesis, it basically says that 'humans acquire language in only one way - by understanding messages, or by receiving' 'comprehensible input' - [w]e progress by understanding input that contains structures that are a bit beyond our current level of competence'. The framing in Krashen (1985) has immediate problems - it seems tautological to some extent, and comprehensible input is not really specified to necessary degree in the quoted work - this is both the aspect of his work that is most influential, and the most criticised. \n\nHe did try to quantify what i+1 is more explicitly in later work; and, in different framing, the idea of comprehensible input is still very much alive (see fex. Krashen 2009.) \n\nThe thing is though that input is only a necessary condition, not a necessary *and* sufficient condition. You asked what evidence, the evidence is that if you simply give people a lot of input, there is no guarantee they come back speaking the given language fluently (Harley 1992, Harley, Cummins, Swain, and Allen 1990). That is the empirical issue with the input hypothesis, but it isn't the only problem with it. You can argue that this doesn't disprove the input hypothesis at all - you may be interested in the VanPatten references below - but then you have to answer me what exactly *would* disprove it, given we both agree at least that input is *necessary.* \n\nWe can point to similar things happening in other areas of acquisition research (first language acquisition, early bilingual acquisition, late bilingual acquisition) - it's simply not enough to talk about 'structure' or 'input,' for the model not to be a black box you have to be clear about *what* structure, *what* input. Related to this, showing that someone's language use is informed by implicit knowledge rather than explicit knowledge is not simple. \n\nIt is not as clear from Krashen specifically, but other work looking at more specific aspects of the acquisition of grammatical and phonological structure have made it very clear that only *specific* structure is relevant in specific contexts. This may seem like pedantry to someone otherwise disinterested, but it isn't - this *is* the model being a black box, a black box isn't a good theory. The natural order hypothesis as put forward by Krashen is relevant here, and can be seen as making some progress, but ultimately the hypothesis as originally put forward doesn't work out, as (1) there were issues with many of the studies underlying this hypothesis, (2) there is a lot of variation in acquisition not really covered by the assumptions of the original hypothesis, and (3) it quickly becomes murky as to where to draw the line in acquisition - the old competence Vs. performance topic in ling - is something acquired when used correctly in production, or when understood in comprehension, for example? \n\nTo bring it back though, it turns out that much else helps in acquisition, such as the form of the input, promotion of explicit formal awareness (something that seems unintuitive given we would expect the communication to be comprehensible on purely semantic-pragmatic grounds, with form being irrelevant), and output. These are all things that simply don't fall under the input hypothesis for the most part, though you could argue that the former two falls under the 'kind of' input (with the second I'm not referring to grammar-translation style reinforcement of explicit knowledge.) But none of those are necessary, it seems, so we're left with no clear sufficient criteria (but many things that demonstrably facilitate acquisition), and only a necessary criteria - a lot of current research is exploring what the sufficient criteria are, and the aforementioned effects (ie. if modifying the input, explicit nudging, and feedback, and types of interaction, and so on in specific ways can help have a bigger effects) with an eye towards considering the sufficient criteria and facilitating acquisition. \n\nIt bears mentioning that noone is denying that there is a disjoint between explicit and implicit teaching. Acquisition sometimes happens in cases absent of some or apparently all of the things mentioned in the paragraph above, even if input alone doesn't always lead to acquisition. This is anecdotally enough to convince a lot of educators and linguists alike of the Input Hypothesis, but I would say the broad opinion of people in SLA is one of much more scepticism.\n\nI was strongly worded earlier in this thread, nowhere have I meant any disrespect to Krashen and his work. It's been a mixture of having been repeatedly exposed to people who don't want to engage and tiredness because of my work schedule. His work is the foundation of pretty much all modern SLA with the exception of stuff like Swain or DeKeyser, or some more specific theories in psycholinguistics, syntax, morphology, and phonology. It was just too vague to qualify as a substantial theory, in the scientific sense of the term, but that doesn't mean it is unrespectable or so on. Also many of the current 'theories' are somewhat misnamed to that effect, too, where they are more like general catchment frameworks that have smaller theories in them, but they themselves do not make many explicit hypotheses. \n\nApart from all this there is the side issue that Krashen's Input Model (the five hypotheses and the broader model set out in the same works) and the later Monitor Model implicitly rest on the assumption of a Language Acquisition Device, aka. a Universal Grammar. That's far too much of a rabbit hole for here, but it's safe to say that the existence of and nature of an LAD is contentious. Even if there is an LAD, it is not immediately clear that it exists or is structured in such a way that would support the Input Model. But, there are many input-oriented (in fact all SLA is input oriented) theories that do not require any such assumptions, that instead assume the use of domain general learning processes in language acquisition. \n\nSome references are below, see specifically the Krashen references, the alternate view proposed by Hatch 1978a, 1978b and the studies done in Canadian immersion programs by Harley 1992, Harley, Cummins, Swain, and Allen 1990, the work starting with Long 1981 and that starting with Swain 1995.", "created_utc": "1642544803.0", "edited": "1642581169.0", "id": "ht8lhql", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_s4gqdq", "parent_id": "t1_hszsyts", "score": "4", "subreddit": "LearnJapanese", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qyls"}, {"author": "haelaeif", "body": "Ja, arabiska \u00e4r ett fall d\u00e4r m\u00e5nga lingvister betraktar de moderna dialekterna som enskilda spr\u00e5k.

'Ett spr\u00e5k \u00e4r en dialekt med en arm\u00e9 och en flotta.' Detta \u00e4r de kriterier som vanligtvis anv\u00e4nds.

Till och med mandarin i sig kan f\u00f6rmodligen betraktes som en spr\u00e5kfamilj, och det finns ett antal av dessa 'dialekter.' Ett annat exempel \u0101r de regionala spr\u00e5ken i Italien, som i stort sett \u00e4r obegripliga f\u00f6r n\u00e5gon som bara kan standardspr\u00e5ket, som \u00e4r med den toskanska dialekten som f\u00f6rebild, och ett annat av dessa spr\u00e5k. (Se dock n\u00e4sta stycke.)\n\nStandardspr\u00e5ken i de skandinaviska l\u00e4nderna \u00e4r till stor del gjorda f\u00f6r att vara mer distinkta \u00e4n vad m\u00e5nga av de skandinaviska dialekterna faktiskt \u00e4r. Vad man har i Skandinavien \u00e4r vad som kallas ett dialektkontinuum. I ett dialektkontinuum finner man vanligen att n\u00e4rliggande dialekter f\u00f6rst\u00e5r varandra, men om man g\u00e5r till exempel till en provins bortom den n\u00e4rliggande provinsen har talarna p\u00e5 den f\u00f6rsta orten sv\u00e5rt att kommunicera med dem, och s\u00e5 vidare och s\u00e5 vidare, tills man befinner sig i andra \u00e4nden av kontinuumet och talarna inte kan f\u00f6rst\u00e5 varandra alls. Ett dialektkontinuum bryr sig inte om det finns nationella gr\u00e4nser, s\u00e4rskilt inte om dessa gr\u00e4nser \u00e4r s\u00e5 genomtr\u00e4ngliga som de skandinaviska gr\u00e4nserna; det p\u00e5verkar inte dynamiken (jag \u00e4r lite reduktionistisk, jag rekommenderar starkt att du g\u00f6r din egen lesning).\n\nI Skandinavien h\u00e5ller denna f\u00f6renklade modell i viss m\u00e5n; i m\u00e5nga delar av den svenska och norska gr\u00e4nsen talas dialekter som \u00e4r konsekventa i omr\u00e5det f\u00f6r det mesta oavsett vilken sida av gr\u00e4nsen personen faktiskt bor p\u00e5 (\u00e4ven om, ja, utbildning och m\u00e5g p\u00e5verkar detta). Men det bryts ocks\u00e5 ner, till stor del p\u00e5 grund av terr\u00e4ngen och den historiska f\u00f6rflyttningen av m\u00e4nniskor, s\u00e5 man hittar fickor av dialekter i Norge som i m\u00e5nga avseenden liknar dialekter en bra bit bort i Sverige, men som skiljer sig fr\u00e5n dialekterna runt omkring i dessa avseenden. I detta sammanhang blir avgr\u00e4nsningen av ett spr\u00e5k fr\u00e5n ett annat i slut\u00e4ndan ett godtyckligt spel som styrs av den kulturella och politiska situationen. \n\nAllt detta p\u00e5verkas ocks\u00e5 av \u00e5lder, utbildning, var man har bott och arbetat osv. Utbildningssystemet och medierna f\u00f6r\u00e4ndrar ofta dialekterna snabbt, liksom historiskt sett diskriminerande attityder till talare av andra dialekter; i stort sett ser vi en homogenisering mot prestigevarieteter.  \n\nEn del av dessa dialekter \u00e4r helt obegripliga f\u00f6r talare i stora delar av kontinuumet \u00f6verhuvudtaget, till exempel talare av \u00f6vdalsk och andra dialekter fr\u00e5n Dalarna. \n\nJag m\u00e5ste g\u00e5 och sova nu, men TLDR \u00e4r att m\u00e5nga lingvistiker kommer att se sig f\u00f6rv\u00e5nade \u00f6ver denna fr\u00e5ga och fr\u00e5ga sig om de inte redan \u00e4r s\u00e5 h\u00e4r.

It can be an acquired taste, and the world of tea is huge. Also, if you try one pu and don't like it, don't write it off. \n\nI'll go point by point here:\n\n- What is pu?\n- Where can I buy it?\n- How do I make it?\n\n# What is p\u01d4'\u011brch\u00e1?\n\nIn a general sense, puer is a tea processed in a specific manner that comes from in and around Yunnan province in China. It is *generally* considered a subtype of h\u0113ich\u00e1 ('black tea', no, not *that* black tea - that is h\u00f3ngch\u00e1 or 'red tea' in Chinese), but not always, and some people even consider heicha a subtype of puer. More on this later. What does the processing look like? Quite a bit like green tea, usually, actually, with some additional steps.\n\n1. Tea grown, tea picked. A very important step with a lot of variables and specifics that I won't touch on here. \n2. The picked leaves are withered in the sun on bamboo sheets. This step is optional, but observed for most of the puer that I drink, at least. Also, this stage isn't as simple as it sounds, they pay a lot of attention to it, and obviously if it rains it's not good. \n3. A kill green process. This is done via exposure to high heat - for puer, this is done in a big wok, an oven, or a rotating oven-type machine. (Other methods exist - sencha is steamed, for example, and white tea doesn't undergo a kill green step at all.) For pu, the kill green is less absolute - some enzymes are less active, so that some oxidisation can continue. \n5. The tea is usually then rolled, by hand or machine. \n6. Then it is dried in (usually indirect) sunlight. \n7. It is then stored, loose like this. This is maocha, a term that tends to just refer to tea that hasn't finished processing. This is the last step before pressing for sheng puer. For shou puer, it is piled up in a moist, warm environment, to speed up all that microbial goodness. This was fisrt done in the middle of last century, likely to imitate the flavour of aged puer - the result is actually quite different, but still delicious. \n8. Both are pressed. Fermentation can still occur after this. \n\nThat out of the way, let me clarify something - the relation between heicha and puer. Heicha in general is tea that has that wet piling stage in the processing - and so shou puer is a kind of heicha, it\u015b just heicha that comes from Yunnan/Yunnan-near areas. In practice, though, terms aren't really applied as strictly as we might expect, so this is most a rule of thumb than anything. All this is to say is there is a lot of heicha that isn't shou puer that is worth trying.\n\n# Where can I buy it?\n\nr/tea has got your back. Some sellers to check out are Yunnan Sourcing, Crimson Lotus Tea, Bitterleaf Tea, white2tea, etc. There is a vendor list somewhere there. There is also an r/puer that can help. \n\nSome notes on how to go about exploring the big world of puer. \n\nFirst, you might find you like sheng at a specific age or from a specific region/terroir/cultivar more than others - these can all make the tea taste quite different. I advise trying some young shengs (say, current year - 5 years old), some middle aged shengs (five to somewhere like 8 or ten years old) and then aged sheng (beyond that 8-10 year mark) - the latter can be quite expensive, mind. \n\nFor shou, I would say age is less important, so maybe just get whatever seems good for the most part, but eventually pick a really old cake or two to try. \n\nIn addition to where it is grown, the plants, and the processing, and how old it is, storage matters.\u015eo that is another factor to bear in mind. \n\nFinally, don't close yourself off to other teas. Try Indian and Sri Lankan blacks, Nepali teas, white teas - pressed and unpressed - from India, Africa, China, Vietnam, try sencha, try dancong, try yancha, try anxi oolongs, try all the hongs, try sencha. Explore!\n\n# How do I brew it?\n\nAt the most basic level, a mug will do. Leaf + mug + water = tea. \n\nBut, a pot can open up the ability to play with parameters. Also, many people find young sheng in a mug to be too strong (I like it!). Puer for the most part is fine in a mug as well, but, if you try broken leaf teas, you will want a pot with a filter (shou tends to be broken, but the bits tend to sink. A lot of heicha this isn't the case with though, so if you try fu zhuan or something, maybe use a pot.)\n\nFor a beginner, I would recommend a porcelain pot at 100-200ml. 100ml is more flexible I think (though honestly even 100ml can be a bit large for all but sencha, pu, and white for me), but I like 200ml for pu. A gaiwan also works, and some people use other things like shiboridashi (works well for maocha). A metal pot will do in a pinch (so long as it isn't low quality steel - you don't want metallic taste) and some people like glass, but I don't. A sidenote is that for Indian blacks, a larger pot is also useful (I like 300-400ml). Sencha can be fiddly to brew in most things that lack a filter, but it's much easier doing sencha in a pot without a perfect filter than trying to brew good anxi oolong in a flat kyusu!\n\nBut, perfectionism aside, any pot you have for pu is fine. (For other teas, it matters more, I guess). \n\nNow, I would say the specific steps of brewing vary a lot depending on prefernce. I would shoot for probably 6-12g:200ml (keep it on the lower end to see if it's too strong), use boiling water, and go with 45s first steep, 1 minute after, 1 minute 30s or 2 minutes, 2 or 3 minutes, etc. This is how I like it - and I almost always use 12g, except with shu, where I sometimes go even higher (though usually I'll use a smaller pot for that, say 8-10g in 100ml pot), but some people like doing faster pours of a few seconds. \n\nOh, also, rinse the tea for like 10 seconds before doing the first steep. Just throw the rinse away. \n\nIf you've any questions hmu or ask on the r/tea or r/puer subs.", "created_utc": "1641656949.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hrsdvuj", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_rxx63h", "parent_id": "t1_hrlw53y", "score": "1", "subreddit": "zen", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhmf"}, {"author": "haelaeif", "body": "I have issues with Zoom on X11.

More pointedly, though, it depends on the license used. Some open-source licenses expressly forbid this when you license your software with it, so if you go closed-source you're effectively opening yourself to legal action. Some licenses also expressly forbid other companies taking the code and using it in specific ways (see the debacle with Mastodon code and the Trump social network). Other licenses allow you to basically fork the code into a closed source project, while leaving the original open sourced code up (of course they're likely not liable to sustain hosting costs etc.) Many licenses are pretty permissive and basically say you can do whatever.\n\nWith privacy apps, it depends. If the message has to go via an intermediary server where it is decrypted, that's a privacy risk.\n\nThis is one of the reasons many privacy messaging apps are not really private. Another reason can be metadata collection - you can identify people pretty readily (as well as who they know, who they are talking to rn, etc etc) based on metadata and enough other info, it's one of the reasons privacy oriented email (which always includes a lot of metadata) is really hard to do properly both as a provider and as a consumer. \n\nWith signals source code, yes, basically it relies on people reading the code. Malicious code being put into open source projects is a very real thing that does happen. The main difference I would say is that you can see it has happened, if you go looking, whereas if it's a closed-source app you cannot (and closed-source apps are abused by hackers, govts, militaries.) \n\nFor signal there are many forks, so they would be unaffected by signal going awry. \n\nAlso for signal, they have a decent record at this point of refusing subpoenas. They collect a very limited amount of data - as shown by info given *in* subpoenas. \n\nBut mostly you still can't tell what code signal deploys server-side. This is the other problem with open-source apps. They may have their code open-sourced, but the actual code they deploy can be different. For signal this actually happened for a while, where the released code was behind the developed server-side code. \n\nBut as I said, signal has a good record thus far. Also unlike other apps that claim to be privacy oriented, signal both doesn't deencrypt messages server-side, and to make things harder for anyone wanting to read those messages, signal uses forward secrecy, which means the key they would have to break is different each time. However, info still passes through signal about who is receiving messages, so this could potentially be used to build up a map of relationships and to identify you as sending a message to Y person at X time, but depending on your threat model this isn't an issue - if you're a government whistleblower, it might be an issue, if you're a regular consumer, maybe you don't care. It also seems signal doesn't have access to this data rn, as shown in current subpoenas, but if an alphabet agency started to ensure that they have to store the messages on their servers, that could change. \n\nSome of the forks allow you to send messages via Tor, which is cool. They have some other cool features too. \n\nThe most secure apps out there are P2P encrypted messages. An example would be Torchat, though this had a limited metadata issue in the past with some server-side code, I believe it has been fixed. There were other issues, for exame the handshaking process allowed for users to be identified, but these should have been easy to fix - I don't know if they have been. \n\nIn terms of the best messaging apps to use, they are probably XMPP, Jami, Signal (and forks), Session, Matrix, and Briar. Depending on what you're doing and why. Maybe Torchat, I'm not familiar with how it works these days. \n\nSignal is probably fine if talking to people you know IRL and you're just a regular person.", "created_utc": "1638183443.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hmioasv", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_r44pzk", "parent_id": "t1_hmikvdt", "score": "7", "subreddit": "Anki", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s9lm"}, {"author": "haelaeif", "body": "Anki (the desktop version) is open source, meaning anyone can view, copy, modify (after forking), or contribute, etc. the code as long as it complies with the GNU Affero GPL license that Anki is licensed under (it is the licensing that makes it open source).\n\nIf the devs took it and made it private and paid, someone would just use the code that was already licensed as open source and make a new project with it. \n\nYou can see the code here: [https://github.com/ankitects/anki](https://github.com/ankitects/anki)\n\nYou can read the GNU Affero license here: [https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.en.html](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.en.html)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nA 'fork' is when someone takes an open source program and makes a new project from it.

I mention this because if you're a non-AAA gamer (or someone who does video editing or such) you may actually be better served by going big, because the CPU can last productivity/non-AAA players a few more years (sheer core count tend to be more important than clock speed for compiling). The 12900K and 5900X are the best options here imo. If going for these beefier CPUs, I would lean towards the 5900x personally. \n\nOtherwise your best options are 5600x + 5800x on team red and 11600K + 12600K on team blue - you said you were thinking 12600K so I guess you know how many cores you want already. At the lower price bracket, I'd probably go AMD. At the higher bracket the two companies picks are almost identical for gaming in real terms (with 12600K having a slight edge, like a few %, maybe less than 2% in most games), so I recommend buying dependent on pricing.\n\nI would figure out what mobos, RAM and coolers you need when considering ahead of time; there's a chance that while the 12600K is better for a gamer, it may not be so in terms of price:performance if you factor in mobo + ram (if going ddr5) + cooler. While the Intel chip *is* better, it may not really be worth the higher price. Only you can decide really. I will probably be doing the same thing, debating if I want a 5800x, 12600K or a 5900x.\n\nEdit: my notes were near incomprehensible to begin with, should be better now.\n\nalso, in terms of mobo, I'd probably go b550 tomahawk or aorus pro for AMD, my use case fits the latter more. not sure on intel mobos yet.", "created_utc": "1637786983.0", "edited": "1637788831.0", "id": "hly4o9i", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_r09tr7", "parent_id": "t1_hlrft27", "score": "2", "subreddit": "buildapcsalesuk", "subreddit_id": "t5_2slj0"}, {"author": "haelaeif", "body": "No - that's exactly what I mean.

I see in another comment that you may feel that your Japanese isn't at the level where you could, say, read academic works in it. \n\nI am making that as an assumption to give this advice.\n\nSo, here is what I suggest, but you can deviate a little or change the order (say if you become more interested in dialectology than the history of the language). You continue studying modern Japanese, and at some point you start picking up some of the historical language, either via materials for Japanese students or via some of the English language introductions out there (they are usually labeled as being books about/for 'Classical Japanese.')\n\nWhile doing that, work through the introductory linguistics books I am about to recommend at a leisurely pace. If you want help with learning the topics, I can DM you a discord link for a server if you use it. Consider a book as 'required reading' (of course you can do what you want tho) if I don't note it as optional:\n\n- Basic articulatory phonetics: A Course in Phonetic, P. Ladefoged, K. Johnson *or* Introducing Phonetics and Phonology, M. Davenport, S.J. Hannahs.\n- Phonetics bonus round (optional): The Sounds of the World's Languages, P. Ladefoged, I. Maddieson\n- Basic phonology: Introducing phonology, D. Odden\n- Basic morphosyntax: \n\n(1) Understanding morphology, M. Haspelmath, A.D. Sims. \n\n(2) Now, there are two ways you can approach this part. One way is with a formal approach, the other is with an approach that is generally less formal. I don't know which appeals to you; I'm leaving the choice to you because I don't know that the way I was first taught was actually right. Way one: R.M.W. Dixon, Basic Linguistic Theory OR T. Giv\u00f3n, Syntax. Way two: Core syntax, D. Adger AND THEN MAYBE Linguistic Minimalism: Origins, Concepts, Methods, and Aims, C. Boeckx. \n\n(3 - optional bonus round) If you really found the last bullet interesting, check out, firstly, the Linguistic Analysis and Syntactic Description series by Cambridge University Press (this is a tour-de-force of linguistic typology/the study of cross-linguistic variation); secondly, the book Grammatical Theory by Stefan M\u00fcller (available free online, this covers almost every syntactic theory out there, with illuminating discussion at the end); thirdly, the Oxford Handbook of Linguistic Analaysis (basically people talking about how they do analysis, you'll see all kinds of approaches here.) All of these are optional, however. \n\n(4) *Finally*, the good stuff: Historical linguistics. For this, my recommendation is Historical Linguistics, by L. Campbell. Top book. Others would tell you to get the Trask book; I can't speak for earlier versions, but I found the Trask book subpar (despite the respect I have for Trask as a linguist). Of course, at this point, you can start reading the Frellesvig and Vovin books quite happily. Optionally, you may be interested in a book on Indo-European, for which I'd say to pick up  B.W. Fortson IV's Indo-European Language and Culture - but if you're only interested in Japonic, that's cool. Also, I can't help but suggest it, as it's the field I am increasingly reading myself into these days, but it is optional - two books on grammaticalization: Grammaticalization, E. Traugott, P.J. Hopper, and then The Oxford Handbook of Grammaticalization. \n\nAt this point, you'll have read a good chunk of what an undergrad ling. student would read. But, for example, I haven't touched on some subjects, like semantics, pragmatics, sociolinguistics, psycholinguistics, etc. You may find you want to read on those later. \n\nBy now, regardless of if you skipped the optional stuff, you can jump into research literature on the historical language to your hearts content - you shouldn't have any trouble with difficult terms or bashing your head against incomprehensible prose (and the main point of all this supplementary reading is to get you stable to read that kind of prose). Your Japanese should be good enough to read the stuff I posted in Japanese above if you did that all in tandem (or maybe a bit short of being able to, I don't know. Depends how fast you learn either ling. or JP or what your current level is), which is probably where I'd start after the Vovin and Frellesvig books (maybe it might be better to start learning classical *here* rather than earlier, I don't know. It depends if you're interested in *reading* classical Japanese, or just in learning *about* it and its development into modern JP.)", "created_utc": "1624663928.0", "edited": "1624664127.0", "id": "h31vo9i", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_o6tftc", "parent_id": "t1_h2vu023", "score": "5", "subreddit": "LearnJapanese", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qyls"}, {"author": "haelaeif", "body": "I was gonna say - if they aren't, I sure wouldn't mind you rifing through your bibliography!\n\nThanks a ton for taking the time to gather together all the recommendations.", "created_utc": "1624661337.0", "edited": "False", "id": "h31qxwb", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_o6tftc", "parent_id": "t1_h2zhhky", "score": "3", "subreddit": "LearnJapanese", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qyls"}, {"author": "haelaeif", "body": "Probably better to look on sites outside of Japan - I don't think Frellesvig's books are published by a Japanese publisher, so you're basically looking at imported stuff, that also happens to be academic.

And/or, to learn some kogo \u53e4\u8a9e. There are some books on it in English, and you can make a start with those, but by and large the materials are in Japanese, and you will want a decent level of Japanese.

I wonder to what degree the major dictionaries coupled with the classical ones I mentioned above wouldn't cover the same ground. Maybe another commenter will just happen to be familiar with all of these, my money would be on u/matt_aegrin ? (sorry for the unsolicited ping).\n\nAlso, one of *the* major dictionaries for Classical Chinese is in Japanese, the \u5927\u6f22\u548c\u8f9e\u5178. It may be able to shed some light occasionally, but at that point you\u0155e doing your own etymology work which might be a bit much. \n\nI'm unsure how much linguistics terminology you know in English or Japanese, or what specifically your interest is: if it's just etymology, just kanji history, or if you're interested in how languages and the Japanese language specifically has changed (as well as what the language is like at different points of development). My ranty answer has covered all those bases well except the first two, because I don't know the best materials for it, but I have not touched on the background you would need to go deeper.

There was another poster who wrote some very good posts on here about how they made cards for history, geography, etc.\n\nI think much of my issue is deciding *when* to make cards, and when not to. And also, how to format/conceptualise it, ie. ankifying a point Chomsky makes in *Language and Mind* \\- that might well be contentious, or even rejected by later Chomsky - is going to be wildly different from ankifying a definition of a term in a book on semantics, and both different from trying to remember details about some specific set of data. \n\nFor example recently (well, over the span of the last few months) I made some cards about (amongst other random stuff) the aformentioned work by Chomsky, some on an article about infrastructure projects under the Trump administration, some from a monograph about some topic in historical Indo-European studies (about prepositions in Celtic languages), and some more on the news and, well, I quickly wound up deleting most of them a few months later due to them not being good cards - either poorly worded, things that were superfluous, things that don't actually help with retaining understanding of the content, etc. I suppose I generally felt that I was just reviewing stuff I didn't have to, either because the card wasn't very good, or because it was made before I'd learnt the material well enough, or because it simply wasn't something I needed to know. I don't really have many cards that survive this long-term critical review process. Maybe that's a good thing, and I shouldn't worry about making them. \n\nI like the idea about writing thoughts about thoughts. I tried Zettelkasten before, the closest I usually get is scribbling into a journal. I definitely think thoughts about reading (questions, criticisms etc) come more naturally to me than trying to internalize content, anyway, but maybe that is the divide I had in my original post - one internalizes a textbook, it's not often that you internalize an op ed or some piece of research literature in the same way.", "created_utc": "1620400519.0", "edited": "False", "id": "gxa5xaq", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_n6w02z", "parent_id": "t1_gx9pd37", "score": "2", "subreddit": "Anki", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s9lm"}, {"author": "haelaeif", "body": "Hey, thanks for reading such a long post and for writing a reply. \n\n I'd used anki a little for music, but mostly for learning the names of notes/the layout of a guitar fretboard.\n\nI don't think I'm very smart, it's just that lately I've been reading a lot of papers on foreign policy and stuff, usually I read in linguistics and philology... There's definitely a range of difference in how I approach these things, at least conceptually. It's also not what I should be doing, but rather what I enjoy: I'm stuck working minimum wage jobs when I *can* find work, and I failed out of a degree, so I 'should' be learning to code or etc. to get a chance of a better financial future but.. doing something I don't immediately care about for a non-present carrot is not something I'm good at doing on the best of days, much less after work and long commutes.

I find it works very well for statements, equations, equivalences, things you could have a hypothetical dictionary or short encyclopedic-esque definition of.\n\nBut when reading more advanced literature - research handbooks, studies, etc. There is sometimes a nascent feeling I *should* be remembering more, but I can never figure out how to (a) figure out what that is (*unless* it is something I keep coming back for - then I notice), and (b) how to go about it efficiently. \n\nBut then, I've also - after going backwards and forth on this a lot - generally given up on any kind of notetaking in (what I construe as) a basic sense anyway, so that\u015b a related thing... They're related because the same kind of content I would make notes on would be the same kind of content I would ankify for the most part (when reading) - there are other kinds of notes, organisational stuff, of course, that isn't relevant. \n\nAnyway, the main reason for this is that I find notemaking/anki works well for introductory exams or for subjects that involve problem solving or short, written answers, or you to know specific figures or mention specific names or papers. You can ankify figures, questions about figures and numbers, you can put in problem-sets, you can put in definitions, etc. \n\nBut if you start reading at a higher level - by which I mean the kind of reading you'd be doing in a graduate course (I failed out of an undergraduate, so I certainly don't mean something esoteric by this, I simply mean the *kind* of literature) - I find it nigh impossible to ankify content, or, on the notetaking side, to make good notes. At *most* I will tag a paper in a reference manager or a .bibtex file, sometimes not even that (if I'm reading a paper too late and I would rather be asleep lol), and very very rarely I will write a small summary like XYZ argues this, because of this, in this framework, big if true, but maybe not true because X. But usually these summaries are.. not useful. I mean, I will look at them, then look at the paper anyway, realise I strawmanned them (even if I agree with them), or the summary will be too short, or so on. \n\nHalf the time I feel like I just read stuff, it goes in one eye, out the other. Goes into my reference manager, where it will never come out again unless something sets me off searching.

Average for days studied is 644, average for period 202. (lol). And I've definitely been going harder than I should, I think. Actually cutting out non-language learning content has been a general but slow process, for some of the reasons above. I deleted a whole deck of Welsh cards a few months ago, and regretted it every day since, so... yeah, trying to be careful about what I take out/leave in, but I realised that a lot of the content I had in my General deck was just useless overspecific stuff eating my time, and I'd rather spend it learning vocabulary if I'm going to spend it in anki at all. \n\nMight change back from low-key anki/average ease factor-style to regular anki so I can use it on my phone soon.

(But, for example, most materials only discuss 'classical,' occasionally they will refer to a kind of intertribal koin\u00e9, but information on the specifics of the development of either classical and Qur\u02be\u0101nic has not really been given, other than mentions that the original QCT of the Qur\u02be\u0101n was likely Hejazi.

I would wonder, hesitantly, to what degree this Buddhism > Shinto dynamic is ultimately due to historical cultural politics, or whether such conjectures are very off the mark in terms of the historical dynamics between the two and in terms of our available sources. \n\nCan I ask likewise, how do you feel as a practitioner of Shinto about the sheer plurality of religions? One of the things that keeps my interest academic for now is that I feel that many religious traditions contain things that I instinctively believe to be correct on some level, but that many of these traditions are also incompatible in that they do not operate within the same frame of discourse (eg. while I can certainly criticise a certain interpretation of scripture in Christianity, it doesn't follow from this that I could say Christianity *qua* Christianity has something inherently wrong about the world - I might say this in other contexts, but it doesn't follow from the other.) As a result I have found myself engaging with, academically and physically, many religions, depending on context, opportunity, and if it feels correct and respectful to do so (to all parties). \n\nIn light of this general mess of contradictions, one of the main reasons that I do not *practice* Shinto is that I feel a cultural disconnect. While I agree with many of the hinted perceptual understandings within Shinto (as varied as they are), genuinely feel that the belief in kami specifically matches with my own experiences and perceptions, and feel that many of the rituals and their purposes again match with my perceptions of the world and how I think we should be disposed towards it, it is unclear to me, as a non-Japanese person on the other side of the planet, if practice beyond mindfulness towards kami is desirable or respectful - be they *the* kami, or a non-culturally specific 'kami,' which as you have pointed out before, may not wish to be worshiped or approached in any of the same ways (and significantly, I feel, may not *perceive* themselves in the same way). If I were to visit Japan, then I would not feel any such barrier to partaking in rituals, again if it seemed the respectful thing to do, just as it has seemed right to leave offerings in the temples of other religions before. \n\nNaturally, most of such perchance engagement means that I do not routinely practice any religion in terms of ritual outside of a physical, geographically-present context. I certainly undertake actions with the same intention as I see for various practices and try to uphold values I believe in, but I do not undertake actual rituals. Perhaps I am na\u00efve to think there is a difference, or na\u00efve to see affinity between personal behaviour and ritual. \n\nPerhaps as well, there is no right answer here, and I do not see it.", "created_utc": "1584613338.0", "edited": "False", "id": "fkwzyle", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_fkjec2", "parent_id": "t1_fkt6uw8", "score": "1", "subreddit": "Shinto", "subreddit_id": "t5_2trsm"}, {"author": "haelaeif", "body": "[https://the-eye.eu/](https://the-eye.eu/) have a fairly sizeable selection of Cambridge texts. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI also wanted to say somewhere that, CUP occasionally just like, makes the pdfs available.

English 'cloud' coming from Old English cl\u016bd 'a pile of rocks, stones, a hillock.')\n\nThe idea that there is a 'correct way to speak,' that 'the language is degrading' etc. is very engrained in a lot of languages and cultures but there's literally no reason for us to think there's some Platonic form of English for us to strive for; correctness is defined by speakers' conventions - the same processes that gave us modern English from OE are also giving us AAVE, Australian English, Singaporean English, etc. (The same of course goes for Japanese dialects.) \n\nPeople tend to take dictionaries as classifying correct usage but their actual job is to capture actual usage. \n\nMy point here isn't to lecture you on why some forms of prescriptivism are silly, though; it is to try to illustrate that everything in language is context-sensitive. It's not really the case that Japanese is in some sense 'more context-sensitive than English,' as I see people often claiming, but more that they simply differ in what they grammaticalise (further, most people are used to thinking of English as they think of *written English* - record yourself talking for a whole day, you'll realise the majority of your utterances leave out as much stuff as the average colloquial Japanese sentence does; but when you learn Japanese, books touch on this, because it's evidently sensible to do so or you would sound like a prose-spurting robot.)\n\nEven if we take something as chaotic as French orthography; it's still largely possible to guess the underlying pronunciation in 99% of cases, there's just a lot of patterns to learn because spelling is largely etymological. Similarly to Japanese, though, you can't really know (though you can certainly make an educated guess at) the written form from pronunciation alone a lot of the time, you have to actually see it spelt. This again works via us guessing at underlying meanings from context; when I encounter a new French word (as someone who doesn't know much/any French), I have to leverage my intuition regarding spelling -> pronunciation and utterance -> meaning. \n\nAnother point worth considering is that a lot of even basic language is ultimately idiosyncratic. Take the word understand. Why do we understand? We can't stand under. Historically you could forstand. \n\nLikewise, why do we do the washing up? Why not the washing down? I tend to scrub sideways, actually. \n\nI guess you get my gist; you've probably encountered yourself a number of Japanese compounds or compound verb constructions that made little discernable/intuitive sense to you as an English speaker initially. Again, it's a combination of adhering to perceived convention to form grammamtical utterances and deriving from those rules to form utterances that actually form your point, on the production end, and leveraging you intuitive understanding of convention and deriving guesses from it on the comprehension end. These guesses do not match up 1:1; my idiolect (dialect, too, probably) of English differs from yours. How I speak Japanese will be seriously different from how you do; we're both non-natives with different models of the language in our heads.\n\nEdit: You've been downvoted, but it wasn't by me.

The study skills people at uni just thought I was being overanxious. Maybe this is all because of deep-rooted anxiety. \n\nI'm quite good with sticking to my studies, but I've not wanted to study programming, as it just... I mean, I don't find it so interesting. I find applications of it interesting, and have used bash, R, and even some C for this and that, but most software development is just unappealing to me outside of my immediate needs or scientific contexts. I currently spend a good few hours a day studying math (I want to learn up to some really high-level topics, because I want to better understand Operator Grammar and some other maths-heavy linguistic frameworks), Welsh (my current language of study; I'm conversationally passable in one other and almost reading-fluent in a third), and some other stuff - I had said to myself I'd focus on IR/politics for six months (to try and focus myself), see where I end up, but really I've just been reading all kinds of stuff.

Philip Kapleau, who had met Suzuki while serving as court reporter at the International Military Tribunal in Tokyo, witnessed his encounter with an angry member of the Yale audience:\n\n> \u201cIsn\u2019t it true,\u201d [the questioner] asked, \u201cthat warlords like General Tojo meditated in the Zen monasteries of Japan?\u201d\n\n> \u201cYes.\u201d The answer came slowly and softly.\n\n> \u201cHow compassionate a religion is Zen Buddhism when it allows warlords of his ilk into its temples?\u201d\n\n> Dr. Suzuki paused for what seemed like an eternity as the tension mounted among the audience. The silence was thundering. The answer came slowly:\n\n> \u201cDon\u2019t you think that a soldier, who has to face death many times, needs the solace of religion even more than a civilian?\u201d\n\n> Such sympathies lend Victoria ammunition for his campaign to represent Suzuki as a vital contributor to the development of his country\u2019s martial ethos, but it simply was not so. Sato places the bushido issue in proper historical perspective: \u201cThe militarists hardly needed Suzuki to formulate a bushido ideology for them. Bushido was already central to Japanese military culture from at least the Tokugawa period (1600- 1868)\u201d and from that time onward was \u201cthoroughly familiar to the modern Japanese army officer corps.\u201d In actuality, if there was anything innovative in Suzuki\u2019s understanding of bushido, it was his reversal of the army\u2019s dogma, presenting bushido as a peacemaking, potentially liberating and liberative path.\n\nThis all brings to mind an interesting essay I read recently (in Norwegian, mind): https://arrvev.no/artikler/kristine-bonnevies-vitenskapelighet-og-rasehygienen\n\nEdit: It goes without saying that demanding individuals to make explicit stands against dictatorial or even millitaristic regimes is, ultimately, in some sense erroneous.

It seems clear that Suzuki took issue with Japanese militarism in the context of the Pacific War, but that there is a grey area regarding his views of Japanese nationalism more broadly. I was aware of this grey area when posting the article; I believe Victoria to have taken leave of some facts in the pursuit of rhetoric. \n\nI personally take less issue with any would-be nationalism, and more issue with the other points raised by the OP; occidentalism, exceptionalism, vague universalism, and the historical portrayal of Zen (which each have some inherent contradictions) - aside form this, I take some other issues, such as his bad faith towards other perspectives. \n\nHowever, I recognise that these views may be premature, and I would need to (a) read his English works much more closely, (b) read his Japanese-language works, and (c) have access to personal documents and archives, as well as (d) conduct a much more systematic search of secondary literature, in order to properly come to a conclusion. I am also aware that the earlier Suzuki held very different views to the later Suzuki, and that many of the contradictions mentioned above are (a) forgiveable on account of circumstance in some cases, (b) quite besides the point for much of the points discussed in his works, and (c) are expected given the human condition.\n\nThis is primarily why I asked for the sub's thoughts - I am not trying to push the idea that Suzuki should not be read - I think he should be, more widely. \n\nIn the light of all this, while the article (and Sato's that is referenced) may provide astute criticism of Victoria's book, I do not think it totally removes the issues pointed to in the OP (though I want to make clear that I don't find the arguments presented in the OP somehow renders Suzuki's bibliography as *useless* or *harmful*). \n\nAgain, thank you for the article, it was an interesting read!", "created_utc": "1577743799.0", "edited": "False", "id": "fclb6wm", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_ehs2ql", "parent_id": "t1_fcl7hto", "score": "1", "subreddit": "zen", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhmf"}, {"author": "haelaeif", "body": "Haha, I noticed this, as well.

I would argue that one should treat each translation of work in its own right as an independent work. This does not mean it is devoid of value, of course. The quote goes 'It is a pretty poem, Mr. Pope, but you must not call it Homer.' No, you must call it Pope. Seniority does not necessarily imply value. There is some irony, there. \n\n> Chinese wording is a little more layered than ours, it probably never gets perfectly translated.\n\nFollowing from the above, one must ask themselves: What do they want from reading this (translated) work? Personally, I do not think that the chief aim here is usually 'to understand the text that inspired it,' I think this is just a common subsidiary reason to read translations; not the main one. Rather, one hopes to learn something.\n\nAs someone with a linguistics background, I implore caution in making generalisations about the nature of speech. I can tell you, knowing some historical languages, that interpretation and translation can be exceptionally hard. \n\nTo end my little sermon, a quote, not by a Zen Master:\n\n> The more strict religions require that men shall look upon their activity simply as one means of carrying out a metaphysical scheme: an unfortunate choice of calling may then be explained as a test of the individual. Religions keep their eyes fixed only upon the salvation of the individual . whether he is a slave or a free man, a merchant or a scholar, his aim in life has nothing to do with his calling, so that a wrong choice is not such a very great piece[Pg 111] of unhappiness. Let this serve as a crumb of comfort for philologists in general; but true philologists stand in need of a better understanding: what will result from a science which is \"gone in for\" by ninety-nine such people? The thoroughly unfitted majority draw up the rules of the science in accordance with their own capacities and inclinations; and in this way they tyrannise over the hundredth, the only capable one among them. If they have the training of others in their hands they will train them consciously or unconsciously after their own image . what then becomes of the classicism of the Greeks and Romans?\n\n> The points to be proved are\u2014\n\n> (a) The disparity between philologists and the ancients.\n\n> (b) The inability of the philologist to train his pupils, even with the help of the ancients.\n\n> (c) The falsifying of the science by the (incapacity of the) majority, the wrong requirements held in view; the renunciation of the real aim of this science.\n\nApologies if my raving bores you - I enjoyed the correspondence, I believe I have learnt something, myself.\n\nEdit: The quote may be a bit overly abrasive.

The former, broad one, isn't really problematic as an ad-hoc definition, but, I mean, it's not much *use*.   \n\n\nIt brings to mind two (abstractly) related discussions - Wittgenstein's musings on the differentiation of symptoms and criteria, and the issue of language classification.   \n\nFeel free to skip the below, if it is too long. \n___________\n\nI will discuss the latter, as it is the one I am more familiar with. Say you have a country, with many speakers of many idiolects. Naturally, you may like to see them fairly treated without discrimination based upon the way they speak. How to actually do so? Well, you cannot simply define all idiolects as individual dialects - you'd have to write tailored documents for all of them!   \n\n\nThe traditional solution in sociolinguistics is to use ausbau-criteria - that is, social criteria. This is generally coupled with the argument that a truly linguistic differentiation between A and B without any dependence upon social factors is, actually, impossible. Hence, English is a language. RP is a dialect. Scots is a dialect of English. Italian is a language. Venetian/Ven\u00e8ta is a dialect. So on.   \n\n\nThis is largely how the EU charter on minority languages does things. See this quote:  \n\n\n> (a) 'regional or minority languages' means languages that are:  \n> (i) traditionally used within a given territory of a State by nationals of that State who form a group numerically smaller than the rest of the State's population and\n\n> (ii) different from the official language(s) of that State;\n\n> \\[and does not include dialects of the official language\\]\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHunky dory, everyone's rights recognised! Well, in practice it falls a long way short - because by definition, anyone who speaks a variety without some serious historical and cultural backing power (and since the French Revolution, European states have gone to great lengths to erase such identities), speaks a dialect, and not a language. And because we cannot differentiate the two linguistically, we *must* refer to ausbau-criteria. This ends up with us in the absurd position where the standard Italian speaker who cannot understand Milanese is said to be speaking the same language as the Milanese speaker, and so on. \n\nAs it turns out, there is little evidence to support the dogma that we cannot objectively distinguish speech varieties by linguistic criteria - mutual intelligibility rates prove to be very reliable - at least, inasmuch as they can be expected to be, given that language changes (and hence, classifications would vary over time - which we shouldn't really be surprised by).  \n\nBut this still leaves the question of, explicitly, how to slice the cake? \n\nLet's take three varieties, ABC - where A is the spoken variety that most closely approaches the norm that is the 'State language' - a real-world example is taking RP/Estuary English for British English. Variety B is highly intelligible with A - we can unproblematically call it a dialect. C, however, is poorly intelligible for speakers of A - we *must* consider it a regional language, regardless of intelligibility with B. This means that A and C will have legal status; while speakers of B can access their rights via either. This is a marked solution from now, where legally speaking, the status-quo inparted by the French Revolutionary idea of civc-nationalism is upheld by a charter designed to do the opposite (and, objectively of ones opinion of the morality of all this - one can see why it being ineffective is undesired). \n\nHow, then, do we slice the cake of religion versus non-religion? Is our definition simply reference to theism?

Such is a fairly common tendency, especially within monotheistic religions.\n\nSo I did some more browsing while on the train. I think one has to remain open to the possibility of there being truth in such arguments - after all, one may eventually conclude that a given perspective is, simply put, true, to the exclusion of contradictory views. But one would take some serious convincing, and ad hominems/ab homines would certainly not suffice, and that is largely what I am seeing being bandied about.\n\nClaiming that X and Y are *historically* unrelated is a harder claim to argue when the great weight of introductory sources seem to contradict the claim - either one has some serious original academic content waiting to be published, or one lacks a coherent argument.
