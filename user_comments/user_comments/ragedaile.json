Of course not having modern medicines or modern comfort leads to living conditions that are worse than the ones we have but I am saying other thing most notably the social life was very important and was a bigger factor than what we could think. \n\nAlso you have to think that if you don't know any better well you just live with it, if you had to put any of us in their conditions it would be hell and if you had to put them here it might be hell too.\n\nEdit: one major source is \"daily life in the middle Ages\" By Jean Verdon\nMost of his work are actually about daily life, unfortunately they're in French maybe not translated if you really want I can look for sources in English.", "created_utc": "1660505713.0", "edited": "1660506013.0", "id": "ikahawp", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_wo4ad3", "parent_id": "t1_ikaftan", "score": "7", "subreddit": "trippinthroughtime", "subreddit_id": "t5_2y3e1"}, {"author": "ragedaile", "body": "The other three don't remind me anything so I will check for Algerian medals", "created_utc": "1660505317.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ikagcqw", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_wobt0z", "parent_id": "t1_ikag8n6", "score": "2", "subreddit": "Medals", "subreddit_id": "t5_3551d"}, {"author": "ragedaile", "body": "Lower left is Croix de guerre (war cross) 39-40 also called Vichy. \nLower right is Croix du combattant (fighter cross)", "created_utc": "1660505269.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ikag8n6", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_wobt0z", "parent_id": "t3_wobt0z", "score": "2", "subreddit": "Medals", "subreddit_id": "t5_3551d"}, {"author": "ragedaile", "body": "Of course that's undeniable, modern medicine is one of the greatest progress the industrial revolution brought to us although it is important to know that despite the high infantile death (most of them at birth) a person that passed the age of 12-14 could live a relatively long life being 60-70 or even 80 wasn't unheard of.

It's a very rough I'm not a paleontologist. \n\nBiblical characters that aren't clearly fictional like Moses are single individuals, so unless they are influential individuals like kings their existence is almost impossible to demonstrate, but also impossible to refute. How would we prove that this peasant from Palestinia 3000 years ago actually lived? Some characters have existed following most historians like David. Does that mean that the biblical David and the real David are the exact same person? Of course not. \n\nNow I guess the most debated character is Jesus. It is commonly admited that Jesus existed. We do not have archeological proofs. But to be honest how would we find the skeleton of a sect leader from 2000 years ago? And if we did how would we know it's actually him and not some random farmers? We do not have the skeleton of Alexander the Great, Cleopatra or Cesar yet no one question their authenticity. So like most of the historian has to use other materials, because the absence of proof isn't the proof of absence. Historians then study other sources, mostly texts, Christians or not, and their work concluded that Jesus existed. To conclude this they studied the Bible of course but also pagan historians like Suetonius, Tacit who talk about very early Christians, and finally Flavius Joseph who very quickly mention Jesus, when he actually talks about the death of his brother Joseph. The work of historians isn't to prove the existence but to study all the sources they have and then to draw conclusions, and they concluded that Jesus existed like some other characters but also unlike some characters. \n\nNow what did Jesus do and was he actually the Jesus that the Christians claim he was is another question which cannot be answered by scientific ways, but as I said the absence of proofs isn't the proof of absence. Faith isn't incompatible with scientific study. \n\nThis was too long for such a bad meme\n\nEdit: this is is too long so to summarize ---> some characters existed what they actually did is another question", "created_utc": "1659384895.0", "edited": "False", "id": "iijvvuo", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_wdk8bc", "parent_id": "t3_wdk8bc", "score": "2", "subreddit": "hmm", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qlxm"}, {"author": "ragedaile", "body": "What does it mean then?

So I guess it already counts as not \"only\" Watching TV. \n\n Then let's say that I didn't immerse myself on purpose, the point wasn't to learn English just to gain access to content, so I would always watch stuff that I would understand. For 2-3 years I watched mainly the same niche content, either about history or about one or two very precise video games.

You don't have to learn them through anki it you watch enough content. \n2.

This example of course isn't the worst one. \nAnd the amount of words for every single thing actually affect the learning of everything, grammar is just patterns and if you know every word but not the grammar you will pick up the grammar fast.

But when it comes to speak no amount of listening is enough to instinctively know which verb to use in the case of Russian. No amount of listening is enough to know that this random verb doesn't take accusative but genitive. And you need to know it when speaking or messaging otherwise Russians will not get you for some reason. \n\nFor example I never learned with stress marks it would be useless how can I remember it. But whatever the amount or exposure I would get I would never get the stresses right. \n\nAnd above all I repeat it one of the hardest part is vocabulary the amount of vocabulary in Russian is absurd and without that amount of vocabulary you cannot understand so immersion is useless.

For me the biggest issue is the amount of vocabulary and the very fact that if you use an extremely close synonym but not the exact right word Russian will not understand. The second biggest issue is the verbs for reasons I have mentioned in another comment. And then only the declensions. \n\nWhy are the declensions so low? Simply because even if semantically I haven't associated the ending to an automatic meaning it is still possible to understand most of the time, especially to reading. What I meant is that it's a bit less logical than simply using a clear word order because a word order like French can be flexible yet precise without using declensions.\n\nEdit: but I respect your opinion maybe some terms I've used for Russian are too harsh but I do think that French does things more easily and that most of the time because it's easier it is more logical", "created_utc": "1647811097.0", "edited": "False", "id": "i1ga0l3", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_thl9cr", "parent_id": "t1_i1fvegq", "score": "1", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "ragedaile", "body": "Rules are meant to not be followed in Russian, for verbs yes there are rules when the palatalisation occurs but in order to know you need to know the imperative which in most cases implies that you already know how to conjugate a verb\n\nAnd anyway if it was truly logic it would get straight to the point like English or French without needing to decline every word that is in it self such a loss of time.", "created_utc": "1647783686.0", "edited": "False", "id": "i1ehi6x", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_thl9cr", "parent_id": "t1_i1bq4hf", "score": "1", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "ragedaile", "body": "I have stopped studying russian for about a year now so I might not take the best examples but I will try my best to explain why russian gave me that impression\n\nThe main one that I remember is the palatalization of consonant for certain verbs and although the changes are very logical the moment when they happen are far less logical. Like for verbs -\u0432\u0438\u0442\u044c yes it becomes \u0432\u043b\u044e in the first person but then why \u043f\u0440\u044f\u0442\u0430\u0442\u044c is \u043f\u0440\u044f\u0447\u0443 but \u0447\u0438\u0442\u0430\u0442\u044c is \u0447\u0438\u0442\u0430\u044e ? It's the same ending right? \n\n\nThe way they use prepositions combines with the verbs and declensions are totally random and unpredictable, how am I supposed to know when a verb uses dative accusative genitive or something else and espcially with wich prepostion? An example but not the worst one would be the verbs of motions \u0432o\u0439\u0442\u0438 or \u0438\u0434\u0442\u0438 \u0432?\n\nThe fact that russian verbs go by pair is already weird enough. But the fact that those pair are completely unrelated and unpredictable is beyond my understanding. How am I supposed to know which is which?  \u041f\u043e\u0431\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0442\u044c and \u043f\u043e\u0431\u0435\u0436\u0434\u0430\u0442\u044c how? (And also why \u043f\u043e\u0431\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0442\u044c has no first person singular? It's supposed to be a regular verb). And how am I supposed to learn something like twice the amount of verbs than i know in my own native language \n\nThe sheer amount of vocabulary in russian is also a problem but that does not depend on logic. In russian any english word will have dozens of translation. That sounds already complex but those words despite being synonyms in russian can not be interchangebly used so if you use a word and that is not exactly the word they use in russian but a synonym, well, russians will simply be unable to understand you.\n\nThe stress in words is a pain totally random totally useless as it doesn't give any information or meaning but yet Russians will think you're a  absolute retard if they even understand you when you say \u0433\u00f3\u0442\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0442\u044c instead of \u0433\u043e\u0442\u00f3\u0432\u0438\u0442\u044c and that's still one of the clearest examples as it is only o letter that actually changes depending on the stress\n\nFrench has a structure that is way simpler very few words in comparison very regular verbs despite what we can think and not so many tenses because we don't use most of them. And most important if you go outside of Paris people will be very welcoming and very forgiving with mistakes. French people are used to interact with people speaking bad French so even if you misuse a word forget a conjugation we will understand. Of course I'm not saying French is pure logic the gender of the words is very arbitrary although not fully because a French person will most likely be able to guess the gender of a word it had never seen before proving that it's not arbitrary but it actually uses patterns unlike Russian pair of verbs.", "created_utc": "1647782144.0", "edited": "1647783576.0", "id": "i1eemde", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_thl9cr", "parent_id": "t1_i1amlo2", "score": "3", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "ragedaile", "body": "Russian because I like logic things but nothing makes sense in Russian I got really frustrated.

And the fact that it is a preindustrial society, makes the economy far less flexible. If you tax someone at that time, you're most of the time taking away money that pays for a vital need. Today it might be the case, but it isnt for most. \n\nAlso the debt isn't the only cause of the revolution, multiple factors are important. The shift in the mentality, the need for the rich members of the third estate to gain a political representation, one of the third thing that will happen when the general estates will be gathered is that the third estate will ask to double it representation. That also shows the impopularity of the class system. And another factor was the bad weather of the year 1787-1788 that led to terrible harvests, and people started to starve sometimes to death. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAbout the powers of Louis XVI, in such system the powers of the king really depends on his personality and his actions. Louis XIV was all powerfull because he submitted the nobility and was able to more or less control every departement of state. In the case of Louis XVI he was easily influenced and terribly indecisive. You can understand his traits by reading Michelet for exemple. \n\nYes Louis XVI was at the beginning in favor of some reforms especially economic ones, but he was quickly stuck, because of the influence of the court who wasn't in favor of such reforms. And because the only way to convince his court to accept such reforms was to impose himself which he was unable to, his reforms didn't came. That's a very informal game of influence with a lot of intrigues and the king isn't above that game. But his will to reform wasn't so strong either, because he couldn't tax more the peasents who already struggled a lot, he thought of taxing the nobles and the clergy, but as i said they were opposed to that and had a lot of influence (the clergy was the owner of a third of the land), but the main thing is that it would have been against the concept of privilege and the division of the society in three estates. Except that questionning this principles is questionning the monarchy already and the power of the king. Because by taxing the nobility and the clergy you're taxing the \"choosen ones\" the best ones that were \"chose by god to rule\" and guess who was chosen by god to rule? The king himself. Taxing them is desacralizating them and make them pay like any peasent do, and that means they're under the law and not under god. That would also question the fact that they're giving a service to the society, and if you're not giving a service to the society and that you're paying like anyone else why would you be called a duke a count or a king? The system was unable to reform itself, not only because of the different powers that were influencing each other's but because of the regime's essence. \n\nSome would say another king would've found another solution, that's maybe true but it would've just delayed an inevitable fall of the absolute monarchy. \n\nThe fact that Macron can raise taxes and not Louis is a question with mutiple answers. The Vth republic is far from perfect, especially since the Chirac's reform. The president has in fact a lot of powers, and his party can in fact pass a lot of laws. But counter powers still exist, the senat the conseil constitutionel, the opposition that is always growing, the assembly ( i don't have a very good esteem of our deputies but they aren't completely stupid either, and i can still write to mine if he does stuff i don't like), and informal counter powers that are hard to really control, the medias the literature, ect... If you want an exemple takes how the budget is voted there are still a lot of debates and the president as little to no power, he depends of his minister and the assembly for that matter. If you compare that to the monarchy it's absolutely not the same. There was no way for the common people to be implied in how they will be taxed. If the king didn't tax more that's not because he was limited by some divine will to save france, but because he couldn't afford to make his people starve to death otherwise he would be the king of a cemetery. \n\nYou said a modern politician can have more power than any past king ever had. I would say yes absolutely. Why? Because the state is more powerfull than it ever was. Compare Stalin to Ivan IV, why is Stalin worse? Not because he wasn't wearing some holy crown, but because had the mean to be worse, the state was more developped. \n\nOur modern republics aren't perfect, but if you gave me the choice i would live in an imperfect republic rather than in an absolute monarchy. In a republic you still have your word to say at some point (in a real republic don't tell me russia is a republic bc it's written in its name). And any infraction to some of my rights can be reported, my rights are written and the justice doesn't depend on the person whom i'm attacking. In an absolute monarchy none of that exists.", "created_utc": "1615308787.0", "edited": "False", "id": "gqci88x", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_m0sl9e", "parent_id": "t1_gqc7drg", "score": "1", "subreddit": "AskFrance", "subreddit_id": "t5_2zkfk"}, {"author": "ragedaile", "body": "You're saying you're studying history? Well you should understand that comparing the level of debt of such different periods is almost impossible. The monarchy was maybe less indebted but the interest rate was absurdly high. Nowadays the interest rate is extremely low which allows the country to be way more indebted without totally ruining itself. \n\nAnother thing is that yes the royalty in France was a dictatorship but every dictator is limited by the nature of its regime. The French king wasn't limited by a formal power, the only thing close to a counter power at that time was the parliament of Paris which was shut down for more than 50years. There was no balance of powers. The only limit was the personal interest of the nobility, only THEIR interest not the people's interest in anyway or form. That's why Louis XIV created such giant court in Versailles (that some historians compare to a golden cage) after the \"Fronde\" (A revolt from the nobility and the parliament) it was to control this nobility. The descendants of Louis XIV didn't keep this nobility under control, so it clearly means the interest of the nobility were the only obstacle to an all powerful king. And this obstacle wasn't a good and moral obstacle. This is why the monarchy killed itself, it wasn't a good regime (I don't need to explain why an all powerful king is bad). All I mean by that is that the monarchy was a bad regime, and yes the king had more power than the president, the president is limited in a legal way, the monarch was limited by his will and by a nobility who only wanted money.", "created_utc": "1615293740.0", "edited": "False", "id": "gqbkxiu", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_m0sl9e", "parent_id": "t1_gqapgj3", "score": "2", "subreddit": "AskFrance", "subreddit_id": "t5_2zkfk"}, {"author": "ragedaile", "body": "That's true", "created_utc": "1615229073.0", "edited": "False", "id": "gq8nplb", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_m0ljbk", "parent_id": "t1_gq8n5tz", "score": "5", "subreddit": "badlinguistics", "subreddit_id": "t5_2ul7s"}, {"author": "ragedaile", "body": "I don't know much about linguistic, but I would just say that in fact the schools suck at teaching us grammar and orthography.

La motivation principale je crois n'\u00e9tait pas la volont\u00e9 guerri\u00e8re ou l'amour de la patrie ou m\u00eame la vengeance de 70 comme on a pu le croire mais la protection de leur famille. C'est en tout cas ce qui revient le plus dans leurs lettres. Propagande ou pas d'ailleurs quasiment tout les soldats s'autocensuraient et beaucoup ne montrait que le \"bon\" c\u00f4t\u00e9 des combats. La propagande et la censure n'\u00e9manaient pas que de l'\u00c9tat. Et j'ajouterais que la propagande n'encourageait pas \u00e0 rester au front mais \u00e0 garder le moral. De m\u00eame pour la population dans les deux cas elle n'essayait pas de changer le point de vue sur la guerre, mais plut\u00f4t de garder la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 motiv\u00e9e. La guerre pour la majorit\u00e9 \u00e9tait justifi\u00e9e et morale mais cela pouvait \u00eatre remis en question devant l'\u00e9puisement.

La guerre de 14 s'est produite, les populations quel que soit leurs motivations et elles sont mixtes (il n'y a jamais une motivation une cause il y avait des d\u00e9serteurs comme il y avait des ultranationaliste x\u00e9nophobe) n'ont fait qui participer. Je pense, et ce n'est que ma vision, que la moralit\u00e9 n'est pas \u00e0 chercher dans la responsabilit\u00e9 de la guerre, mais plut\u00f4t dans son r\u00e9sultat. Les populations ont souffert, ces hommes et ces femmes veulent juste nous dire de ne pas oublier leur souffrance afin de l'\u00e9viter. Bien s\u00fbr on peut se dire que pour l'\u00e9viter il suffit de trouver un responsable. Mais s'il y en avait un on l'aurait trouver. Il n'y a pas un responsable unique, les causes sont beaucoup trop complexes et vari\u00e9s que pour nous permettre d'en d\u00e9signer un.

D'ailleurs les plans de mobilisation g\u00e9n\u00e9rale pensaient qu'il allait y avoir un taux tr\u00e8s important de d\u00e9sertion (10% ? De m\u00e9moire cela reste \u00e0 justifier)mais ce taux f\u00fbt en r\u00e9alit\u00e9 aux alentours de 1% (la aussi \u00e0 v\u00e9rifier mais normalement je ne devrais pas \u00eatre tr\u00e8s loin).

D'ailleurs la conscription englobe de plus en plus d'hommes en fonction des n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 pour pouvoir compens\u00e9 \u00e0 la sup\u00e9riorit\u00e9 d\u00e9mographique allemande, Mais aussi car plus le temps passe plus on peut se permettre de mobiliser une part importante de la population. Mais d'un point de vue plus abstrait la conscription est vue comme un devoir du citoyen \"quand en France un citoyen est n\u00e9 il est n\u00e9 soldat\" Gambetta 1871. Car comme vous le savez le citoyen b\u00e9n\u00e9fice de droits mais aussi de devoirs et la d\u00e9fense de la patrie en est un, pourquoi? Car c'est cette partie qui lui garantie ces droits s'il veut les conserver il doit la d\u00e9fendre.
