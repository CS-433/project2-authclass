Also, I am from a progressive US state.\n\n**Italy Pros:** Healthcare system, higher quality food (but lower variety), more relaxed lifestyle (double-edged sword because sometimes it's hard to get good service), access to rest of the EU, good public transport, interesting culture, and less inequality. I would rather be a poor or lower-middle class person in Italy. I'm from Illinois, so the weather is better.  Much more vacation days.\n\n**Italy Cons:** The infrastructure is really bad for disabled people (I have Muscular Dystrophy) , bureaucracy is disorganized and inefficient af, most of the people I know under 45 are severely underemployed or went abroad, low salaries, and racism is more accepted.  Italy has religious crazies just like the US. I'm in Sicily right now and the development level is comparable to Mexico. Gay marriage isn't legal, just civil unions.\n\n**US Pros:** Better job opportunities, higher salaries, more cultural variety (I'm half Mexican and miss some foods), disability rights and infrastructure, better customer service in general, and more progressive with gender and sexuality.  My university in the US was much more difficult, but I'm sure that varies from school to school.\n\n**US Cons:** Inequality, healthcare access, extremist viewpoints in both directions. There are parts of Italy where it is complicated to get an abortion, so I wouldn't list it as a con in comparison.  Also, Italy has Berlusconi, Salvini, and Meloni.
