Don't stay in the foreigner bubble. If you move here it's likely you will probably meet other people from other countries who are planning to stay temporarily or like myself long term in the country. This happens for a few reasons common culture, language, job, and location. However, It is really important to break out of the bubble and get to know Mexicans it will give you valuable insight into the country and what you may be doing that is harmful. For example, it wasn't until I made friends with my Mexican coworkers and we discussed salary that I realized they were paid less just because they were Mexican ( which is shitty). We were able to collectively bargain for equal pay during our evaluations the following year. \n2. Invest in the people here. If you are making a good living or earning in dollars and living in Mexico tip extra ( in cash when possible) if you decide to hire a cleaning lady, a driver, or any other kind of domestic labor pay them above the typical going rate. As you mentioned also shop local, support local businesses, and tell other people about the local places/items that you enjoy. \n3. Learn the language. I get it learning a language is hard and time-consuming but if you are going to stay in another country for more than a few weeks in my opinion you should be trying to learn the language. Maybe you don't want to reach full fluency but at least get the basics of daily life down so that you can move through the city without too much inconvenience. I would highly recommend the Spanish classes at UNAM CEPE or La Salle. \n4. Don't be an Asshole.

For me when I would binge it would usually be that I was genuinely hungry but then couldn't stop or I was bored and was looking for something to do. Reasons for bienging vary a lot from person to person but here is how I greatly reduced my bienging.  I set a timer on my phone to eat every 3-4 hours and to eat without distraction no eating while watching TV or being on my computer or phone. I try to eat balanced meals protein carb veggie fat, but that doesn't always happen and that's ok. Progress, not perfection has been my motto. This stopped me from getting overly hungry and also made me more mindful about eating.  The second thing I did was I started sewing or embroidery projects. I can do these in the evening and they keep my hands and mind busy so that I am less likely to go into the kitchen.

We use these rewards when we are trying to build the habit we use them often but only after a task has been completed. \n\nThe second type of rewards are the entrees these are rewards we can use probably once or twice a week when we have completed several tasks or a task that required several steps like a project. These could be things like go to movies with friends, have a broad game night, get art or craft supplies for a new project. \n\nFinally, we have desserts on the reward menu and these are typically reserved for meeting a milestone or accomplishing a long-term goal these are used not as a motivation perse but as more as a celebration of the hard work and dedication. These might be things like go to a concert, spend the weekend camping, have a sleep over with friends .  The key to making the rewards work is to have things that speak directly to the kid, and to also make sure they can access rewards often enough for them to be effective.\n\n I use rewards for myself all the time.

There is no ambiguity and the accumulation of meeting my goals throughout the day helped to motivate me in other areas of my life. \n* It requires that I exercise and eat in a way to meet my goals and the program is long enough that I will see results in weight loss, gaining strength, endurance, and flexibility. \n* I was abstaining from alcohol which oftentimes derails my motivation to eat right and exercise and also made me realize that I don\u00b4t need alcohol to take the edge off a day or to celebrate some event. I can in fact go without. \n* The reading did inspires some other changes in my life,  in a world where we are often bombarded with negative information, it was wonderfully refreshing to read something positive every day. \n* I feel proud of the fact I completed this program and stuck with it even when it was difficult \n\nNow the cons\n\n* Andy weighs 75 lbs more than I do why are we drinking the same amount of water. I mean water was probably the easiest part of the challenge for me but it seems like water intake should be adjusted for size. For someone tiny, a gallon of water can be harmful. \n* The program encourages black and white thinking. These foods are bad these foods are good, I have to work out every day or I am a failure. People who are trying to make sustainable changes to their life need to accept they will probably make some mistakes and that is ok, having a treat is ok, enjoying a beer is ok. I think that many people who finish 75 hard revert back to old habits because they have an all or nothing mentality and that is not a good way to transform your life. \n* The program encourages you not to listen to your body. Rest days are ok and they help your body to recover from intense workouts. Because I knew I had no days off I was careful to not push myself super hard because if I got injured or too sore it may be too difficult to work out the next day. I know most of us do active rest days with yoga and walking but even that can be awful if you are in pain. \n* I can only read so many self-help books before it starts to sound cheesy. This one is more personal than the others but the more I read self-improvement books the more I hated reading. Really looking forward to going back to reading the things I am interested in. \n\nOverall I am happy that I did the program and would maybe recommend it to someone who is board with fitness and wants a challenge, but I would not recommend it to someone who is trying to change their life. \n\nMy 75 hard stats \n\nOutside - workouts  running 4 days a week  walking three days a week \n\nInside-  workouts yoga, dancing, and bodyweight strength training \n\nDiet - Vegetarian no sweets and stayed in small deficit usually averaging 300 calories \n\nI lost 6 pounds and 2 inches from my waist, I can now run a 5k without stopping, I can touch my head to my knees in a forward fold", "created_utc": "1615992655.0", "edited": "False", "id": "gr8qaua", "is_submitter": "True", "link_id": "t3_m723ka", "parent_id": "t3_m723ka", "score": "23", "subreddit": "75HARD", "subreddit_id": "t5_1npu72"}, {"author": "lovedbymanycats", "body": "Untethered soul reads like when Joey on Friends wrote Monica and Chandlers wedding ceremony. it just repeats the same things over and over. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v33ftopRPnw", "created_utc": "1615867484.0", "edited": "False", "id": "gr37og5", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_m5vtsu", "parent_id": "t1_gr32hf0", "score": "3", "subreddit": "75HARD", "subreddit_id": "t5_1npu72"}, {"author": "lovedbymanycats", "body": "At first, I thought both of these pictures were day 1 and I was so confused at how you could look so different in pictures taken the same day.
