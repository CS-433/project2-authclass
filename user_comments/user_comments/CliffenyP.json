I think the reason this did work for me and a lot of other people is that English is very close to a lot of very widely spoken languages (all fsi rank  1-2 languages) and most of the people who speak these languages, especially if they're younger come in a lot of contact with English. Because of that you do get a bit of comphrensible imput without having studied anything (the vocab and grammar tend to be very simulair, especially with basic vocab for Germanic language speakers and more abstract stuff with Romance ones).

I wasn't aware they were already selling them for the public, which is awesome! But a violin takes about 250 hours to make (6 weeks assuming a 40 hour work week where the only thing they would do is work on this violin, which probably isn't the case), so even if we can afford the price tag of $8000, there's no way we could keep up with the demand. \n\n1. I agree.\n2. While that would be ideal, as long as the process isn't public or we find different ways to make such vegan instruments, we're not quite there yet. And as violin is one of the most populair instruments, and veganism both as a market and philosophy has been rising rapidly, I don't think (while I could be, and hopefully am wrong) that this maker has been the first one to give it a try or something. \n3. Having looked into it in the past, and having checked some threads about it just now, I don't think most vegans would have too much of an issue with wearing non vegan clothing from before they were vegan. Thinking: 'The damage has already been done, so I'm just going to wear it as long as it's in proper state.' And I think for things like instruments that's especially the case. They are often one of the most expensive things people own, and some people wouldn't be able to survive without it. While I wouldn't say they should buy new ones, I think potentially losing another life over something that won't have an effect on the animal which was slaughtered for it wouldn't do any good. \n\nAgain, we don't really have this fourth option yet, at least not in a way that would be able to keep up with demand. And electronically produced music is incredibly restricting, you'd rely on samples, and afaik with something like a violin that would be much less viable than say a piano. And while I agree that the lives and well-being of those non-human animals are much more important, just using instruments you already had doesn't do much to effect that.", "created_utc": "1650751477.0", "edited": "False", "id": "i5xfdk1", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_ua5v9n", "parent_id": "t1_i5x2mcg", "score": "1", "subreddit": "vegan", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhpm"}, {"author": "CliffenyP", "body": "As far as I know that isn't a possibility.

That means that until we can do this consistently we can either:\n1. Keep making instruments of the violin family from animal products,\n2. Stop making them and stop using them,\n3. Stop making them, but still use them.\n\nOf course the 1st one is out of question, and while it's kind of in a gray area, I think the 3rd one would be preferable to the 2nd. There a a fair amount of musicians of which music helps them survive, not just financially.
