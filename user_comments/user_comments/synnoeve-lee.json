I ate *dinner*. (You ate dinner, but maybe not breakfast or lunch.)\n\n2. When the question uses the question word \ub204\uac00, you usually answer with \uc774/\uac00\n\n*\ub204\uac00* \ucef5\uc744 \ub5a8\uc5b4\ub728\ub838\uc5b4\uc694? Who dropped the cup? / *\uc81c\uac00* \ub5a8\uc5b4\ub728\ub838\uc5b4\uc694. I dropped it.\n\n3. \uc740/\ub294 is sometimes used to compare two or more things, but not in the sense of *comparing* bigger or smaller, longer or shorter etc, but more in the sense of \"something is like this, another is like that\". This is related to 1 - there is something else, i.e. something to compare it with.\n\n\uc800\ub294 \ud0a4\uac00 \ucee4\uc694. \uc81c \ub3d9\uc0dd\uc740 \ud0a4\uac00 \uc791\uc544\uc694. I am tall. My little sister is short.\n\n4. \uc740/\ub294 can be attached not only after the subject (which then will replace \uc774/\uac00), but after objects and other sentence elements, including after some other particles.\n\n5.

It might be confusing at first, but imo it might be better to understand it this way for later stage in learning. (It's gonna be long, hang in there.)\n\nSentences in Korean, unlike in English, don't have to have a verb to be valid. It needs a *predicate* which can be a verb or an adjective. But they look pretty similar, and get similar endings, but they have lots of differences too, meaning-wise and grammar-wise.\n\nLet's look at adjectives. In English, adjectives look the same regardless of whether it is a predicate of a sentence or a modifier of a noun phrase: The girl is beautiful. A beautiful girl.\nIn Korean they are different. For what you call *adjectives* in English, there are 2 distinct kinds in Korean; modifier form and predicate form.\n\nNow, the predicate form adjectives are what some call *descriptive verbs*. They kinda work like verbs, but are descriptive... and describing things is what adjectives do, right?\n\nSo, predicate adjectives and modifier adjectives that were derived from predicate adjectives are more or less the same thing but with different endings.\n\nWhat's on the dictionary as headword is the predicate form that ends with -\ub2e4. \uc608\uc058\ub2e4. \ucc28\uac11\ub2e4. \uc5b4\ub835\ub2e4. \ud06c\ub2e4. \uc791\ub2e4. etc. And if you search these in a KOR-KOR dictionary, it will say \ud615\uc6a9\uc0ac.\n\nThey can become modifiers, as mentioned above: \uc608\uc05c, \ucc28\uac00\uc6b4, \uc5b4\ub824\uc6b4, \ud070, \uc791\uc740. These are also adjectives (\uad00\ud615\uc0ac, to be precise), but used before a noun.\n\nSo, what distinguishes verbs and adjectives? Their meaning. If it is somewhat descriptive or static, it is most likely an adjective. If it involves some movement or action of sorts, it is most likely a verb.\n\nDid I mention that verbs can be used this way and become a modifier too? (Like \"A girl *that is wearing* a coat.\") But that's another story.\n\nTL;DR: descriptive verbs are essentially adjectives, though they kinda act like verbs.
