[{"author": "Cheshire_Cat3333", "body": "German for me. I'm really into history (with a focus on the World Wars and Holocaust + 19th-20th century warfare/societal development), and would appreciate being able to understand more about what was happening in the world back then and being able to read works from that time. I'd also be able to read Goethe and Nietzsche which would be awesome! I'm also interested in learning French, Russian, and Norwegian for similar reasons, though I'm more interested in consuming media than speaking. I'm trying to study German to as high of a degree as possible, even more so than all my other languages as I also find the modern culture, cuisine, architecture, and media just as interesting! I guess suffice to say, I just really like the language. \ud83d\ude01", "created_utc": "1666907282.0", "edited": "False", "id": "iu1mj6n", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_yeg8dx", "parent_id": "t3_yeg8dx", "score": "1", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "Cheshire_Cat3333", "body": "For sure!

I'm currently learning a different language but plan on starting one of these soon and have done some searching for info about both languages. The one thing I can say for sure, is that they both are at the highest level of the FSI chart, so category V. From what I've come to know, speaking Japanese is generally \"easier\" while the writing systems (hirigana, katana, and especially kanji) are quite difficult. I've heard of people learning hirigana and katakana in a couple days or less than 2 weeks, but kanji would definitely take a long time to learn a lot of them. Korean on the other hand has a relatively \"easy\" writing system (Hangul), but from self practice and from what I've heard from others the spoken language is pretty hard. Then again, everyones learning styles and preferences are different as are the languages themselves so I can't really say truly what would be harder or easier for you (or the best), as I don't think anyone really can. I personally try to go for languages that I'm more passionate about (interest in culture, architecture, history, cuisine, sound of language etc.) even if some others may be more useful. What other parts of the languages do you like? Are you interested more in one cultures cuisine over another? These could definitely help you come to a conclusion! I'm pretty close to knowing which one I want to learn (Japanese) as I've been in love with the culture, history, architecture, and cuisine for years.
