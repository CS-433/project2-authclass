I\u2019m wondering, sincerely, what you think might be additional explanations (other than exposure to media) for the high level of English in Scandinavia.\n\n> But also, a) most children don't read fast enough to rely on subs until ~11 years of age, and  b) TV production for children is pretty much never in English, and it definitely wasn't in the 80s in Scandinavia and c) the idea that parents would let you watch TV for hours every day (again, in the 80s) is preposterous. Hour. Maybe. And a film on the weekend. And probably not in English until you get to middle school. - so the children of the 80s, who learnt English in school, did not have 10k hours of English input by age 12.\n\nKids who are good readers can read subs way before age 11. Most kids would cope a few years earlier.\n\nI don\u2019t know about Scandinavia  but I know in other countries that it\u2019s basically preschool tv that is dubbed and that primary schoolers are largely watching subbed content. And often watching teen content.\n\nJust about every kid where I live, Australia, was watching 3 hours plus tv a day in the 80s. But apart from my anecdotal experience there is a so much data in this for many countries. Eg USA this article says American households were watching 6-7 hours tv per day in the 80s. It\u2019s not kids specifically, but I\u2019m pretty sure kids watched for many of those hours. The only kids I know who watched only one hour per day were real outliers.\n\nhttps://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2018/05/when-did-tv-watching-peak/561464/\n\nSo, this would make Sweden an outlier, too - at least compared with USA and Australia. I googled and found Sweden only introduced commercial tv in the mid 80s - was the government channel not appealing for kids? Or are you thinking of your own family experience? Certainly the parents in my life allowed way more than one hour of tv.\n\n>A lot of us got a lot of English media input as highschoolers and up, and then the internet, and that matters, but not all of us.\n\nI agree, this has been my observation of Scandinavians and Dutch I have met and discussed this with. \n\nI didn\u2019t pull the 10000 hours figure out of the air. I\u2019ve seen people say that in this sub. I\u2019ve done calculations based on other comments. Even if watching dubbed content I believe advertising often contains English.

Fashion can change, and my aesthetics preferences can change too, but those two don't go together. I usually prefer something that's out of fashion. I don't follow fashion\n\nI was talking about aesthetics and saying aesthetics are subject to fashion. This seems uncontroversial to me.\n\nI often prefer fashions from different eras myself - they are still fashions.\n\n>Let's see this: would you be able to learn anything from a notebook where someone wrote sloppily? \n\nI don\u2019t learn from other people\u2019s  notebooks.

Would you prefer a textbook that's black and white (boooooring) or has nice design and looks pleasant inside?\n\nThe only textbooks I have used in the last seven years have been black and white and very plain. That\u2019s a 1970s Linguaphone and an Assimil from the 90s I think.\n\nBoth had much to commend them: short, well conceived lessons, very well graded, some humour, well recorded audio. \n\nThe elegance is in the pedagogical design, the functionality. I really didn\u2019t mind their plain aesthetic. I certainly wouldn\u2019t reject them for lack of colour. \n\nWith Indonesian you have very little choice.\n\n>I did try use Anki: once.

I love that my wife is attractive. I visit art galleries. I follow architecture accounts in Instagram. I enjoy beauty in nature and flowers delight me. I want to be involved in colour choices when painting my house and not just let my wife decide! And so on.\n\nBUT, I recognise that much of aesthetics in the digital world, like in clothing fashion and architecture \u2026 is fashion. \n\nThe popular aesthetics change over time. \n\nPopularity wanes and something new comes in and people talk about web design looking tired or dated. Apple has changed the aesthetics of its iPhone icons a number of times. I\u2019d guess that has happened with android, too.\n\nI don\u2019t think 2022 aesthetics are necessarily superior to 2007 or 1995 aesthetics. Just fashion changes.\n\nAND, I really love functionality. Great functionality is as attractive to me as great aesthetics. I think functionality IS an aesthetic with tech, especially software.\n\nSo, anki. The functionality of anki is so great and so much better than all the opposition that I can easily overlook the fact that, out of the box, it looks like something pretty plain from 2007.\n\nAnd, you can always change colours and fonts and put in backgrounds that suit your personal aesthetic. Some people do amazing customisations. \n\nI don\u2019t do that myself because I just want to do my language learning. It\u2019s more important for me to be able to insert pictures and mp3. And sync across multiple devices. And study offline.\n\nI haven\u2019t looked at Quizlet for years but last time I did it was more attractive thank anki out of the box but basically just a standard corporate blue - with no possibility to customise.\n\nSo, when I see people reject anki because of its looks I really struggle to understand. You won\u2019t find anything better in so many ways. If you do, please tell me.\n\nThat\u2019s why I made my comment to OP.\n\nYou are, of course, entitled to you own opinions and choices.\n\nTldr: function trumps fashion for me.

I do however think Paul's PRIMARY contribution WAS an absolute mastery of pop song conventions. And then stretching them and adding new elements. \n\nPeople insinuating that Paul's music was \"old music\" is of course being pejorative and I don't agree with it.

I asked for sources because I've read too much bullshit on the internet. I gave the Emerick quote which I saw as contradicting what you had said.

It's a contribution to the arrangement. Yes, the arrangement, the variable speed, the Leslie, the lyrics, the sound effects loops all make it ahead of it's time. \n\n > So when posts/comments like\n> \n> John was more into developing new sounds and very intriguing lyrics, Paul was more into old stuff yet very melodic are made frequently in Beatle communities, it good to push back on them.\n\nTo restate, I agree the person you were responding to was oversimplifying.

Some teachers notice but don\u2019t do anything to help. Others know but are too busy to help.\n\nBut you seem like a smart person and certainly you are literate in English.\n\nI\u2019ve been a teacher and worked with illiterate kids and adults. People end up with low literacy for a number of reasons. \n\nI\u2019m guessing you moved to this country when you were a kid but everyone in your class had already got a start on reading. And your parents speak English or another language with you? Or something similar. \n\nAnd you don\u2019t seem to have social connections/friends who speak the language or you would feel much more comfortable with it. Do you go to an international school?\n\nSo, intelligent person in a difficult jam, what are your plans for the future?\n\nUniversity? Will that be in English? This language you are poor at?\n\nOr a job?\n\nStay in this country or move?\n\nIf you are staying and need the language for uni or work you need to develop strategies and seek help.\n\nBut maybe you don\u2019t even rally need this language? You have survived ten years without it so far.\n\nAre there literacy courses nearby? Is there a sympathetic teacher you could ask for advice and help from? Can your parents afford a private tutor? If so, make sure it\u2019s a good one and don\u2019t hide your problems from them. How much do your parents know about your situation? How sympathetic are they? Maybe they know how to help.\n\nAnd you need to find people and places where you can use the spoken language in some comfort with low pressure. It\u2019s hard for me to know where that might be - you\u2019ll need to find them.
