[{"author": "AchillesDev", "body": "Not that many, they\u2019re a small part of Catholicism overall. But again, the Greek part has nothing to do with ethnic identification (whether the religious system used in the 1800s and early 1900s or the more modern view of Balkan ethnicity we have today) and everything to do with them using the Byzantine Rite (which is in the Greek language, although some use Old Church Slavonic) in their services instead of the Roman Rite that most Catholics use. \n\nThe link I posted has a breakdown of the different jurisdictions in the former Yugoslavia, as well as the Balkans and Eastern Europe as a whole, as well as estimates for their size. The bigger populations are in Romania and Hungary. Very few of the adherents are Greek in any sense.

A lot of the Greek population came well after the Italians as far as I can tell, with a huge wave starting during the Greek civil war (immediately after WW2) and continuing via chain migration into the 60s and the time of the junta. A lot of Greeks worked in restaurants and especially diners and there wasn\u2019t much opportunity for them elsewhere, so they had to take the risks and open their own businesses. \n\nA lot of the Greeks that came during this time were also from northwestern Greece, which not only had a lot of Italian influence (especially the nearby island of Corfu) but also has a grand tradition of local savory pies itself - my family\u2019s village has an annual festival of pies celebrating this.\n\nPerhaps my family\u2019s history can be illustrative. My yiayia came here as a teenage refugee (recounted in the books Eleni and A Place For Us) after her mother was murdered in the Greek Civil War along with her siblings, and worked in the Greek-owned Table Talk Pies as soon as she learned some English. After the war, she and her remaining family went back to the village to inter her mother\u2019s remains, which had been left to rot in a ravine with other victims. She met my grandfather there, married him, and brought him back to the US. \n\nHe eventually saved enough money to buy a school bus, fit a generator on it, and put in a pizza oven and sandwich line. He would drive in from Worcester to serve students at BU, Harvard, etc. until he got into an accident with a trolley. My yiayia put her foot down and demanded he get a real shop, which he did after getting lost in Waltham. That became Angelo\u2019s House of Pizza on Moody Street which is still around.\n\nThere was (and still is - most of the villages are heavily depopulated) very little opportunity in that region of Greece even in the postwar period, so cousins, aunts, siblings, etc. would come to the US via chain migration, work for my grandfather, learn the business, then go to another town to open their own pizza place for their shot at the American dream. And they were largely successful - many Greek-owned places aren\u2019t owned by Greeks anymore because the following generations were able to rise up economically (usually by the time of my generation) and get \u201cbetter\u201d jobs - doctors, lawyers, writers, politicians, and engineers - pushed by their immigrant parents or grandparents to do something not so intensive. \n\nI\u2019d also dispute /u/DooDooBrownz\u2019s \u201chot\u201d take (actually a freezing cold take among transplants who didn\u2019t grow up with the good stuff) that Greek pizza is a \u201cculinary abomination\u201d - there are certainly poor forms of it, but a **good** slice is up there with any other style. There just isn\u2019t anything that is very good in Boston itself because it\u2019s too expensive to have low cost food in Boston, and most of the Greek population settled well outside of Boston, usually in Worcester. It should also be noted that south shore bar pizza is also a style pioneered by Greek immigrants and is so similar to traditional Greek pizza, it can be considered a subtype of New England Greek pizza.", "created_utc": "1663264558.0", "edited": "False", "id": "iok5jww", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_xeyo0k", "parent_id": "t1_iojox7w", "score": "26", "subreddit": "boston", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3r"}, {"author": "AchillesDev", "body": "Not software devs.", "created_utc": "1663259756.0", "edited": "False", "id": "iojt5f0", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_xewt1p", "parent_id": "t1_iojretf", "score": "3", "subreddit": "boston", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3r"}, {"author": "AchillesDev", "body": "It's a function of the high cost of living and the high demands of a lot of fields here.
