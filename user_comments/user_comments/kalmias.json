used that because the year before my mum had one) so i started using up everything i had learnt in musical theatre and started bawling my eyes out about my dog being seriously ill and what not. i rushed home, told my parents, hugged my dog and ate ice cream.\n\nbut of course a kidney stone isnt something people just casually forget about so for the rest of that summer everyone was asking about my dog's well-being . so much so i actually sent him for some weeks to accompany my dog on a trip in a nearby island (he had a blast there) while i kept lying about him being terribly unwell.\n\nafter that summer, since i had graduated primary school and was switching to another one, i didnt have to keep acting as if my dog was still sick but i really hadn't taken into account how popular my dog was among my old classmates and it got to a point where someone even introduced me to her boyfriend as 'the one i told you about! the one with the sick dog!' and in that moment i knew there was no coming back from that. so yeah i spent other four years acting as if my dog had truly been ill for a while, i had future vets even asking me about symptoms and shit i really didn't know about so i
