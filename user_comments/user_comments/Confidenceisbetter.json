Obviously your confidence in how you look, because having sex when you\u2019re worried about whether your stomach is not 100% in all angles or whether your partner likes your boobs takes away from the experience and is not fun for either partner, people want to see the person they are having sex with, it\u2019s hot.

You should definitely see if that is something you would like as it\u2019s not everyone\u2019s cup of tea. I really like it as it really pushes you to keep up with the work instead of just cramming for exams at the end of a semester and it also really helps to meet new people because you pretty much spend 8 weeks with the same group of around 10 people. You also always have an introduction day when starting here where you get to meet the people from your first course, which is great because then you already know people and kind of have friend even before your first class.

Those who are looking for something more serious will not mind if there is no kiss or action on the first date. Personally i usually don\u2019t kiss on the first date and noone has complained yet. Guys also don\u2019t really judge or reject women with inexperience. You don\u2019t need to tell someone they are your first kiss, explaining your experience is only something that should be done when you\u2019re planning to havw sexual relations with that person so they are more understanding and patient. Good guys will not throw a fit or reject you if you stop them mid makeout because you\u2019re not ready for more. Don\u2019t let your inexperience pressure you, i\u2019m not a virgin and i still like to wait and not jump straight into bed with someone. Many people are like that and it\u2019s completely fine so just go your own pace.", "created_utc": "1661504868.0", "edited": "False", "id": "iluirox", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_wxvw27", "parent_id": "t3_wxvw27", "score": "1", "subreddit": "dating", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhb1"}, {"author": "Confidenceisbetter", "body": "You\u2019ll get all seasons in those few months.

I would say if you can do 12 reps easily with a weight you should increase the weight. But I would also first focus on the execution and your form rather that picking the heaviest weight and going to failure, because if you use heavy weights and your form is terrible you will risk injuring yourself and it\u2019s also not very effective for progress. Once you get the form down for a movement you can push yourself, a lot of people aim to do 8-12 reps per set. I often do 4-5 sets per exercise with a few minutes if rest in between, the length varies on how intense the exercise is, so for squats i rest longer than for bicep curls for example.\n\nYou also don\u2019t need to \u2018prep\u2019 your body for a month with food, a lot of people think they need to switch their diet first before starting to work out but that doesn\u2019t make any sense. Just start working out. Eating protein only has an effect if your muscles are getting worked otherwise your body doesn\u2019t see the need for the protein consumption and will just excrete the excess. Muscle will only get built if it gets used. Generally i would say aim to get an adequate protein intake, there are calculators online, usually it\u2019s about 0.8g per kg of bodyweight that\u2019s recommended. And eat enough carbohydrates and less fat as stregth training requires more carbs as fuel. Hence why a lot of bodybuilders pretty much only live on chicken and rice. Once you are less of a beginner and have some knowledge about the gym and diet you can inform yourself about cutting and bulking and such but i would start slow with everything because just starting out at the gym can already be a little overwhelming. There is no shame in not knowing everything at first, even people who have been going to the gym for months still learn new things, try to keep improving their form, need to google how to use a new machine or how to do an exercise, etc. If you\u2019re lost there is also no issue in asking someone else, most of us feel flattered and are more than willing to help someone out or give a tip or two, we all had to start at some point and know what it\u2019s like. Just make sure you never talk to someone during a set, wait until they are on a break.\n\nIf you have any specifi question feel free to ask, there is a lot of information and i could probably write you a whole article but i don\u2019t want to overwhelm you.", "created_utc": "1659361635.0", "edited": "False", "id": "iii96mk", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_wcziok", "parent_id": "t1_iig0jmh", "score": "2", "subreddit": "workout", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rir8"}, {"author": "Confidenceisbetter", "body": "If you\u2019ve never worked out you don\u2019t need to go full intensity and do a split like PPL.

Apparently it\u2019s also supposed to help some with fine lines and wrinkles but i haven\u2019t noticed any such benefits. Vitamin C helps with skin tone, so it gives a jit of a glow, removes redness, some pigmentation and improves undereye circles. Retinol is a sort of anti ageing product. So it smoothes out lines and wrinkles a bit and it also helps with things like hyperpigmentation from the sun of from scars. It also makes your skin a bit more sensitive to the sun so if you decide to go with retinol you should yse it in your night routine. Additionally make sure to start with a low concentrated product because it can seriously irritate your skin and cause peeling if you use a product that\u2019s too strong. I would probably go with retinol in your case for the scarring and texture concerns you mentioned. I use the retinol 0.2% in squalane from the Ordinary and i use it as a last step in my night routine (because it\u2019s an oil) about 2 times a week.\n\nIf you change your diet the way you say you should see some fat loss.

Not that all those things are bad, i use a lot of them myself, but you shouldn\u2019t introduce them into your routine at the same time. For one you won\u2019t know which product causes a reaction if you don\u2019t respond well and secondly you don\u2019t know which product gave you benefits and is even worth it. You should at most add a new product every couple of weeks (in your skin care) because it takes a while to see the effects of those products and you don\u2019t even know if you need everything you listed. \nPersonally I use the niacinamide serum from the Ordinary and for me it makes sense to use it because it has significantly helped me reduce breakouts. Same thing fir the AHA and BHA mask because now i get less clogged pores that lead to a pimple. I do also use vitamin C and retinol (not together because they interact) but both of them caused me to break out in the beginning, which i know because introduced them in my routine alone. I had to stick with it for weeks because it was purging and not a bad reaction, but still not a great look if you have an important even coming up.\n\nSo I would recommend you start by using a moisturizer and one serum. Either niacinamide, vitamin C or retinol, but not all at the same time. You can also use the AHA and BHA mask as that is just exfoliating once a week. But there is no need to follow what other people have in their routine blindly, when you don\u2019t even know what these products do or if they are necessary for your skin concerns.\n\nAs for your skin and body, i exfoliate before shaving and moisturize after and it helps with ingrown hairs. The hydrating or drinking lots of water as you mentioned is probably your best bet for moisturized skin so I would really do that. However the whole loosing weight toning plan is not that great. 3 months is not that long to see obvious results in fitness, you would have to be very strict about your diet and working out to see a change. Toning is also not a thing. Either you loose fat or you build muscle or both, but you need to know what you want to set up your plan. But again i would not recommend pursuing huge bodily changes when you want your wedding dress to fit.\n\nAll these things you list take time to implement. It takes some people years to build a skin care routine that works for them. Same thing with achieving your goals for fitness and your physique. There is a lot of knowledge required and research to be done on all those things and you can\u2019t cut them short and fast track everything. I know my comment might come across as quite negative or pessimistic, but i honestly just want to be realistic. Because i\u2019ve done all those things with A LOT of trial and error to make it work for me and it took me much longer than 3 months.\n\nYou also mention getting your lashes done. I\u2019m not sure if your lashes in general are a concern or not, but using castor oil on them kind of acts as a conditioner. Really helps if they get brittle and weak from using mascara a lot.
