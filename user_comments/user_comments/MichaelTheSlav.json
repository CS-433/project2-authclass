I always assumed that Chinese characters were all pictograms or ideograms, at least in principle, even if they had evolved so much that the original \"picture\" is not necessarily recognizable anymore.

Are the constituent parts of characters identified w.r.t. meaning, or only with regard to sound, or is the character as a whole simply directly associated with the meaning and/or pronunciation? The last would mean that analysis of character constituents is only a linguist's hobby and an an aid for non-native learners.  \n>  \n>An example. What does a native reader-writer of Chinese see when he encounters \u4ec0\u4e48? Does \u4ec0 quickly evoke the meaning \"10 persons\" and does this somehow evoke \"what?\". Or does \u5341 evoke the sound shi2 (which according to one website is the reason that the character is what it is), and does this evoke shen2 by phonetic similarity? Or does none of this occur to a native reader at all and does he immediately see \"what\"? Or does it depend on how familiar the reader is with a character?

Of course not everything is logical since it\u2019s, y\u2019know, language, but you will be able to see some things that make sense. Like words expressing similar emotions take the same preposition for example; or that an is often used with nouns when speaking of availability, necessity, usage, participation aso.

Maybe it\u2019s not perfect, but it\u2019s mostly because I can\u2019t be bothered to iron out all the finer details, I could definitely do better.\n\nSo the way I learned is I started reading about phonetics on Wikipedia. Started with the page [International Phonetic Alphabet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet) and worked from there. From there I advise you to learn about basic phonetic topics like: phoneme, allophone, place of articulation, manner of articulation and so on. I assume you\u2019re American so you also might wanna read [English phonology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_phonology) and [General American English section on phonology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_American_English#Phonology), because it\u2019s best to confirm your knowledge on something you already know and can see yourself when you pronounce words.\n\nAfter you have some basic knowledge of how stuff works go to [Received Pronunciation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Received_Pronunciation) and see what is different from your own pronunciation.\n\nOf course it\u2019s very helpful to also listen to your accent of choice and hear for yourself how it sounds. I don\u2019t know what to recommend if you do chose RP. As I said there are many British accents. Maybe old British movies? Especially those depicting upper class people, rather than common folk. This\u2019d be my guess.\n\nIt\u2019s probably gonna teach you many unnecessary things about the subject.

Habe den Text auch nicht \u00fcberpr\u00fcft.\n\nDas wichtigste ist: Ein Phonem ist spezifisch f\u00fcr eine Sprache. Das B-Laut im deutschen *Bank* und das B-Laut im polnischen *bank* klingen tats\u00e4chlich fast gleich, aber sie sind NICHT das gleiche Phonem, weil ein Phonem geh\u00f6rt zu einer bestimmten Sprache (oder Dialekt usw.).\n\nDas zweitwichtigste: Wenn ein Phonem gegen ein anderes getauscht wird, \u00e4ndert sich die Bedeutung des Wortes (also bekommen wir ein ganz anderes Wort).\n\n>Also theoretisch w\u00e4re dann fast jeder Laut ein Phonem oder nicht?\n\nF\u00fcr dich sind diese zwei verschiedene Laute. Aber manche Sprachen keinen Unterschied dazwischen machen. Nehmen wir ein Beispiel, aber mit anderen Lauten. In \u00f6stlichen Dialekten von Polnisch haben wir zwei Laute: /\u026b/ und /l/. Sie sind unterschiedliche Phoneme. Also wenn man das eine gegen das andere tauscht, ver\u00e4ndert sich die Bedeutung des Wortes. Zum Bespiel \\*lawa\\* /lava/ \u2013 Lava und \\*\u0142awa\\* /\u026bava/ \u2013 Bank (mit Geld). Also f\u00fcr einen Polen aus Kresy sind diese zwei verschiedene Laute. Keiner wird die zwei verwechseln. Aber f\u00fcr einen Deutschen klingen sie wahrscheinlich sehr \u00e4hnlich, und er bemerkt es nicht, dass diese zwei verschiedene W\u00f6rter sind, weil es im Deutschen nur /l/ gibt. (Ein Deutscher kann offensichtlich lernen, den Unterschied zu h\u00f6ren.)\n\nIm Gegensatz nehmen wir Britisches Englisch. Da haben wir auch dieselben zwei Laute, aber sie sind nur Allophone \u2013 [l] und [l] \u2013 von einem Phonem /l/. Das englische L-Laut (im Britischen Englisch) wird wie [l] ausgesprochen, wenn es vor einer Vokal steht. In anderen F\u00e4llen ist wird es wie [\u026b] ausgesprochen. Wenn du einen Briten danach fragst, wird er bestimmt verwirrt, weil er wahrscheinlich keine Ahnung hatte, dass diese zwei verschiedenen Laute sind. Es gibt auf Englisch keine zwei W\u00f6rter, die verschiedene Bedeutungen haben, und der einzige Unterschied dazwischen ist, dass das eine ein [\u026b] und das andere [l] hat. Das, wenn ein von den zweien vorkommt, oder das andere, kann man in allen F\u00e4llen aus der Umgebung wissen: Wie ich geschrieben habe \u2013 [l] vor einer Vokal, [\u026b] in anderen F\u00e4llen.\n\nAlso ist ein Phonem eine abstrakte Sache und jedes ist f\u00fcr seine Sprache spezifisch. Ein Allophon ist ein Laut, das unter einem Phonem f\u00e4llt (eine Variante). Eine Sprache kann zwei Laute als Allophone eines Phonems behandeln, wenn eine andere Sprache sie f\u00fcr zwei verschiedene Phoneme h\u00e4lt. Es geht um die abstraktische Bedeutung, die eine oder andere Sprache f\u00fcr das Laut gibt.\n\nUnd ein Laut ist nur das \u2013 ein Laut (das kann man technisch Phon nennen).

Tried this method and it didn\u2019t work for me. I\u2019ll describe what I do instead.\n\nConcrete (non-abstract) nouns I usually just learn from flashcards (I use paper flashcards), since those words are really easy, as they mean almost the same thing in most languages, and rarely have any weird grammar points or meaning nuances. Things like \u201eradiator\u201d, \u201ewheat\u201d, \u201eruler\u201d, \u201eforest\u201d, \u201enotebook\u201d. Sure there are some oddities, like in German *See* is usually masculine and means \u201elake\u201d, but in compounds it can mean \u201esea\u201d and is then feminine. But mostly it\u2019s a simple one-to-one correspondence.\n\nWhen it comes to other words I sometimes also use flashcards but more often I learn them the following way:\n\nWhen listening or reading in German I encounter many unknown words. When I see one new word a few times (especially when I think I\u2019ve seen it somewhere before but didn\u2019t check it) I look it up in the dictionary to see the meaning. I then realize what this word described in the video or book I was reading and move on. If I see it anywhere else after that I try to remember the meaning. If it sticks, it sticks. It usually does. If I forget once again then I recheck it and try to remember.\n\nFor example I was watching some video on Youtube in German about gaming and consoles in particular. The word *Leistung* popped up a couple times. I new this word, but only the meaning \u201eaccomplishment, achievement\u201d. It didn\u2019t really make sense. So I looked it up. And I learned another meaning for it: \u201eperformance\u201d. The video was talking about the performance of consoles.\n\nAnother example: I like to listen to German Landknecht songs. I have a rather long playlist downloaded and listen while driving, learning, gaming asf. Since there\u2019s rather many of those songs, and I have then downloaded as pure audio, I haven\u2019t looked at the lyrics of all of them. One such song was [Wilde Gesellen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xi1dzUfLfw). Not knowing the word *Geselle* I always assumed it must be some animal. What else can be *wild* \u2013 wild? But in some unrelated context I saw the word *Gesellschaft*, which means \u201esociety\u201d or \u201ecommunity\u201d. I immediately thought about the song. So what does *Geselle* actually mean? It means \u201ecompanion\u201d! \u201eWild companions\u201d, huh. It talks about soldiers after a difficult march, looking \u201ewild\u201d \u2013 dirty and tired. Granted, this word is quite rare, but *Gesellschaft* on the other hand is quite common.\n\nI notice that with this method I tend not only to remember the word, but even the context where I heard it as well. Of course this is not your goal, remembering how you learned the word. But this exactly will make the word stick in your memory much more than learning from a word-list or from flashcards. There you learn words in a void. But here I could write a whole paragraph about how I learned a word! Next time i think about console performance I might remember how I learned the word *Leistung*, and next time I hear the song I will remember how I thought the first title was about some animals.\n\nWill it work also for you? I don\u2019t know. I only have experience with myself lol. But you can try it and see yourself.\n\nSo about learning synonyms, antonyms and related words: I advise you don\u2019t, or limit yourself to one or two related words. Unless you already know them (the related words). Here\u2019s why:\n\nIt might seem that learning words in those kind of \u201ebunches\u201d will make it easier for you to remember the differences and you\u2019ll avoid confusing them in the future. But from my experience it will do the complete opposite. When I tried to learn this way I never managed to get anything useful from this.\n\nSo instead what I do: I learn word by word. Later, only once I have learned a word and can remember and use it quite well, I learn words with similar meaning or in the same family. Because I already know one word pretty well, I can always refer back to it when trying to remember the new one \u2013 keeping note of their differences in meaning in use.\n\nAs an example: I learned the word *Hinweis*, which means \u201ehint, tip, clue\u201d (I saw this word in a game often lol). Some time later I saw in a Youtube video the word *beweisen* two or three times. What could it mean? I checked the dictionary \u2013 it means \u201eprove\u201d. And the noun *Beweis* means \u201eproof, evidence\u201d (I\u2019d seen the noun earlier I\u2019m pretty sure, but it didn\u2019t stick). So now this new word I learned I might link to the one I already know pretty well. Both have similar meanings: they can be generalized as \u201edirect someone to the true or correct conclusion\u201d or something similar. Of course the meaning is not the same, but I already know *Hinweis* pretty well. If I learned both *Beweis* and *Hinweis* at the same time I\u2019d probably wonder which one is which!\n\nSo these are my two cents. I hope you\u2019ll find it useful. Good luck!\n\nEDIT: Lol, this turned out long!", "created_utc": "1648654227.0", "edited": "False", "id": "i2q54q5", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_ts3g0k", "parent_id": "t3_ts3g0k", "score": "4", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "MichaelTheSlav", "body": "Try the dedicated [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChineseLanguage/comments/tosahn/%E5%BF%AB%E9%97%AE%E5%BF%AB%E7%AD%94_quick_help_thread_translation_requests/) on the Chinese language subreddit (I assume it\u2019s Chinese, and not Japanese or something?).", "created_utc": "1648650932.0", "edited": "False", "id": "i2pwxny", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_ts7q9h", "parent_id": "t3_ts7q9h", "score": "1", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "MichaelTheSlav", "body": "Nie, Pol\u00e5k jest\u00e9m, a tak sie u n\u00e5s m\u00f3wi.

It's actually quite a good idea to use etymology and cognates to make remembering easier. I do it with German: many words have cognates in English (I speak it fluently) while many others have been borrowed to my native Polish. So it makes it easier to remember vocabulary for me.\n\nBut there aren't any specific resources for it, since you're really learning very similarly to most other people, except you can remember words and endings easier since many are the same as in Latin except changed to some degree.\n\nI advise you to read this: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Spanish_language Specifically the sections \"Main distinguishing features\" and \"Internal development\". If you apply those sound changes to a Latin word you'll likely end up with a Spanish word of same or similar meaning. There are also words in Spanish borrowed directly from learned Latin that will have no or few sound changes like \"nocturnal\" (normally ct --> ch like in \"noche\").\n\nOf course you cannot take a Latin word and guess a Spanish one out of it. Sometimes you'll be right, sometimes not. Words change meanings, some sound changes are irregular and of course borrowings often replace native words. But if you come up into a Spanish word and link it to a Latin word you know you'll have an easier time remembering.\n\nIf you want to confirm a word's etymology I recomend going on Wiktionary.

And how to do this?\n\nYour first priority is to destroy all Reformation Centers. This can be done in a twofold way: if the CoR is somebody\u2019s capital, then forcing religion on them in a war will instantly convert it and make it disappear; otherwise you can acquire the province and convert it if you have enough missionary strength (after some time it is possible to convert them but they get \u20135% missionary strength so it\u2019s quite hard).\n\nI just finished an Austria playthrough and I destroyed 4 centers the former way and 2 the latter. For the first, much more versatile method declare war on people who own CoRs or their allies. Remember you can mark people as co-belligerent in the DoW screen so that their allies can join too. This is very useful if you don\u2019t have a direct way to war them. But even then sometimes you can simply not have a way to enter war with one of them. In that case I recommend a no-CB war. If you won\u2019t be taking any provinces this shouldn\u2019t be too much AE.\n\nIf one of the CoRs is not in someone\u2019s capital it\u2019s a bit trickier. You can first take one or more of their provinces, so that they move their capital to that province. After the truce is over war them again, and force-convert them.\n\nIf a CoR is in a big state and isn\u2019t their capital or their state religion is already Catholic so it\u2019s impractical to use the first method then simply take the province and convert it. I\u2019m pretty sure (correct me if I\u2019m wrong) CoRs also get \u2013100% to missionary strength for some time, but after that\u2019s gone you can convert them if you have Religious ideas or bonuses from somewhere else.\n\nTL;DR: Remove all Reformation Centers. Abuse the fact that if you force-convert a Protestant country their capital immediately changes to Catholic, destroying a religious center if it exists.", "created_utc": "1635887584.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hj293la", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_qlbbtc", "parent_id": "t3_qlbbtc", "score": "1", "subreddit": "eu4", "subreddit_id": "t5_2uqat"}, {"author": "MichaelTheSlav", "body": "No longer.

I think that was because some Cuman guy came and took control of the northern part of the kingdom (sorry, am new player, don\u2019t know what these are called; adventurers?), so the Caliph didn\u2019t take that part.  \nAfter that I decided to give the Kingdom of Scotland inside my Empire to my third son.

Since the Kingdom of Jerusalem was gavelkind it was originally going to go to my second son, but he somehow was made the Grandmaster of the Templars, so on succession my first son inherited the Empire and the other titles, meanwhile my third one got the Kingdom of Jerusalem, in addition to the Kingdom of Scotland he\u2019d already had.  \nSo with my next ruler there was once again a crusade called to Jerusalem. I took part choosing some random courtier as beneficiery. I also made sure to choose the stance to give the lands to the beneficiary rather than to myself. So the crusade ended, I had the most contribution and\u2026 my brother, King of Scotland, not only got Jerusalem instead of my beneficiary, he also went independent! What?!

Because they are Castillian culture they want to choose a tag with Castillian primary culture by default.

Sorry for the long wait, I went to sleep and later had some work.\n\nI will only explain the free features more in-depth, because I assume you haven\u2019t bought the newer DLCs yet. Of course nearly every free patch featured map changes and some new tags but I\u2019m not gonna mention that as it\u2019s pretty easy to just look at the map.\n\nSo after Mandate of Heaven the next patch was 1.22 along with Third Rome. The patch and DLC pretty much focus on Russia and Ruthenia, so unless you play there there will be no changes. The DLC buffs the Orthodox faith a ton though, by adding icons (a bit like Protestant buffs but stronger and you can only have one at a time).\n\nThe next one was 1.23 along with Cradle of Civilization. The patch and DLC focus on the Middle East. The DLC adds army professionalism (intended to make army quality more important but it\u2019s just a way to get manpower mostly), ability to upgrade advisors all to lvl 5 (OP but expensive), as well as some content for Middle Eastern countries, mostly government abilities. The free patch added some trade goods like livestock and paper, as well as monarchs and advisors now have their own culture (and related events).\n\n1.24 was mostly AI improvements and balance, but there are more Japanese diamyos and some tags in the Philipeans.\n\n1.25 and Rule Brittania focused on the British Isles. The DLC added coal (late-game economic snowball) and innovativeness (stay ahead in tech and as a reward you have now even cheaper tech; great as Britain and Korea). The free patch added a big feature which is the new mission system. New missions are now specific to a country or group of countries (there are also generic missions for less important countries) and give mostly historical rewards, for example GB gets claims in India, Poland gets Restoration of Union CB on Hungary and Bohemia asf. From this point newer DLCs usually added missions to the countries they covered. Many other important countries from previous updates like Russia were also given missions so that they\u2019re not disadvantaged.\n\n1.26\u00a0and Dharma focused on India. The DLC added government reforms (you can modify your government by choosing a buff every so often, but this system also allows you to transition to a different government; this was later made a free feature so you can see the button for it in the left top corner) as well as missions for Indian tags, and specific Indian estates (castes). The free update changed the policy system and overhauled India (there are now formable tags like Deccan or Punjab).\n\n1.27 added some decisions, events and government reforms to Poland and the hordes.\n\n1.28 was released along with Golden Century. This time it overhauled Iberia and the Maghreb. The DLC also now lets you play as a pirate republic. This expansion and update were not very well received. I\u2019m not gonna list the DLC features because aside from the pirates they\u2019re kinda pointless and uninteresting.\n\n1.29 added content to the Mongol and Manchu hordes, and changed the Chinese Emperor mechanics. Ming no longer collapses from bordering anyone with enough dev. Now if a strong horde that isn\u2019t its tributary borders them they get a disaster and are prone to collapse. There are also new events that boost Ming\u2019s collapse. Manchu/Qing and Oirat also get OP missions and events to conquer China.\n\n1.30 was released alongside the Emperor DLC and overhauled France, Italy, Germany, and the Balkans. While overall I\u2019d rate the update and expansion as good it was FULL of bugs and balance issues on release and got a ton of bad feedback. Almost all of it is now fixed, but some of the features, particularly decentralized reforms for the HRE and new revolutionary mechanics could\u2019ve been done better. The update and expansion were very full of content, so I\u2019m not gonna list all of it here. I\u2019ll just say that the free update reworked the mercenary system (there are now mercenary companies, you can\u2019t hire individual regiments anymore), added a bunch of missions to Europeans (others are in the DLC) and changed the estate system quite significantly (if you can\u2019t figure it out yourself you can either watch some guide on YouTube or ask me and I\u2019ll explain in-depth).\n\n1.31 and Leviathan are the last update-DLC and probably the worst-received in the history of the game. While the 1.30/Emperor release had some balance issues and bugs, this release was downright unplayable. The game had frequent crashes and save corruptions. Fortunately this has been fixed now, but some issues remain like concentrating development is broken. The update focused on South East Asia, so now there are new tags and missions, and there\u2019s also countries in Oceania and Australia now. The Zaroastrian and Sikh religions have more interesting mechanics now too.\n\nThat\u2019s most of the changes, if you have any questions you can ask.", "created_utc": "1629899956.0", "edited": "False", "id": "haakdo6", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_pasokp", "parent_id": "t1_ha7ud0r", "score": "2", "subreddit": "eu4", "subreddit_id": "t5_2uqat"}, {"author": "MichaelTheSlav", "body": "What is the last DLC you remember?

If you\u2019re a beginner play a big country, like the Ottomans, Castile, France. Not something like Albania. Keep up to date in military tech. There are many things that affect your army quality but if your military tech is lower than your opponent\u2019s it\u2019s usually a guaranteed win (unless you have overwhelming numbers). Use diplomats to fabricate claims on neighboring provinces to get a CB. Watch for agressive expansion.

Also if you have a province that produces gold (check trade good map mode) raise its production development for some easy moneys.

I decided to jump from region to region getting achievements. First I played in India as Madurai, Mysore, Garhwal and Manipur. Then I played Ryazan. After that two quicker achievements: *Rise of the White Sheep* and *Back to the Piast.* And then I decided to play Tunis and Morocco and get their achievements (yeah, those aren\u2019t minors).\n\nAll those went quite well, as they aren\u2019t the hardest starts. But my past two campaigns were much harder than I expected and I went a little crazy.\n\nI tried to form Arabia as Najd. I restarted a few times but it never went very well. The last (longest) campaign I was always struggling for money, to the point that I made a controlled bankrupcy. But that was of little help as nearly all my expansion routes were blocked. I tried very hard to open new ones by getting vassals but I ended up having too many of them and they were disloyal and I had great difficulty annexing them (that was totally my mistake of course). What finally killed my morale was when I declared on Ajam and expected Timurids (who had more than twice their troops) to help, but they peaced out and Ajam forced me to release a bunch of stuff and took my best province Baghdad\u2026 In hindsight I should\u2019ve focused on the Mamluks and just take Egypt with help of the Ottomans before they do it themselves, and only finish up Arabia after that. Egypt would probably give me a much better income.\n\nSo after that I had had enough of Arabia and starting without feudalism, so I tried Byzantium. I figured this would be relatively easy because in the first war you can easily take up to two mothballed forts, and the Ottomans often just siege down Constantinople disregarding your armies. It still took me a few tries but finally I got a good piece deal. I took almost all of Greece, Thrace, and the fort in Kocaeli, as well as annexed one of the beyliks. So I thought everything was gonna go quite well from that point. Well no, the second war was more difficult, and although I won it I also git into massive debt. Now I think I should\u2019ve released Bulgaria before the war, so I would\u2019ve taken more provinces and hurt them more. I only managed to take three provinces.\n\nI was very crippled because of the debt. I tried to use my foothold I got in the south of Anatolia to expand eastwards but that route was blocked as Mamluks allied Dulkadir. I tried vassalizing Dulkadir but they were attacked by the Ottomans before I could do that. I had no way of expansion in Europe either. One last idea I had was using the age ability to jump with claims to the Caucasus. I think I should\u2019ve just no-CBd them, I would\u2019ve wasted less time. But then my ally Hungary was attacked my Poland-Lithuania. Hungary was allied to Austria so I thought they were safe but Austria declined that call. The other side was quite overwhelming so I though that Hungary was gonna fall quickly, I would let my land be occupied and run away with my army, and the war would end, me not losing anything. I didn\u2019t want to decline the call because I still had few allies, and those I had would\u2019ve lost trust with me. But I was very wrong as Hungary instantly blitzed Cracow and Warsaw, and Poland instead of defending them or even attacking Hungary went straight for me. So I sat there waiting for Poland to full-occupy Hungary losing money from my own occupations, and not being able to make a decent peace deal either.\n\nAfter that war I ditched Hungary and allied Muscovy. Then I realized I\u2019m probably not paying off the debt so I just hired advisors to get some techs as I was lagging behind, before declaring bankrupcy. But then the Ottomans attacked and Muscovy declined the call to arms. They seemed completely not bothered by losing over 1/5 dev in the first war, or by getting beaten by the Mamluks later, they were even more powerful. Maybe I should\u2019ve declared bankrupcy right after the second war.\n\nI think I\u2019ll just play England.

Trade buildings are completely useless if you can just conquer the relevant trade nodes. If you can\u2019t they can be useful (f.e. in MP) but mostly on trade centers and probably only marketplaces.\n2. Depends how hard you\u2019re gonna blob. If you\u2019re blobbing build them everywhere. If not, as many as it takes to lower your gov cap below the limit. No, state maintenance is a nice addition but not worth it on its own.\n3. The only times I\u2019ve built naval buildings was when I was going for a specific achievement that required 500 ships or something. Shipyards might be useful but you can usually ignore them. Docks are just trash.\n4. I usually build barracks in big provinces (usually when it gives me +1000 extra manpower). Regimental camps are trash.\n5. For the other ones as you called them: I also don\u2019t build them. They could\u2019ve been more useful if they gave us more building slots in provinces! But unfortunately they didn\u2019t. State houses are for blobbing, yes. Also normal manufactories (+1 goods produced) are the best building in the game. +1 goods produced is for all intents and purposes equivalent to +5 production dev.\n\n>Well, I have very little experience with them. My best guess is that the building giving production efficiency and local goods produced is the most important, right? Then comes trade power and production efficiency.\n\nThis is what I do too.\n\n>The other tree, I have no clue.\n\nI ignore the other ones until I have infinite moneys\u2122, then I spam-build every investment there is. The one giving manpower is the most useful now that I think about it.\n\n>And the \"big ones\". Trade steering seems nice, but if I control most of the trade node, is it worth it?\n\nThat\u2019s only one thing that this bonus does. But it also has one more effect. From the wiki:\n\n>Additionally it is used to increase the trade value that a nation steers in a given direction. At a base rate, trade value steered towards the next node increases by 5%, however this is increased by the trade steering of the steering nation. So for example, a nation with 100% trade steering increases the trade value by 10% of the base trade value it steers to the next node.\n\nSee? So basically what this means is that for any of your merchant steering trade from a node, some amount of money is created *ex nihilo* and added to the amount steered. By default it\u2019s 5%, but with trade steering, and especially going through many nodes it can grow to very large amounts. Let\u2019s do the math:\n\n* if you steer trade through 8 nodes where you have 100% TP, having default trade steering (so +5%), then if you began with 100 ducats at the first node, at the end you\u2019ll end up with 100\u00d7(1.05)\\^7 = 140.71 ducats\n* if you do the same, but you have the +50% trade steering from the investment (so +7.5%), then you\u2019ll end up with 100\u00d7(1,075)\\^7 = 165.90 ducats\n\nThe more trade steering you stack and the more nodes you steer your trade through, the more money you\u2019ll make. It can increase to ridiculous amounts. You can look up Zlewikk\u2019s run when he stacked bonuses to obtain insane trade steering, and after conquering the world his income became +1 million ducats: [click!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFPlTnI4POM&list=PLQYwQrZmzDdL2LsNBxmu9XP42FBo3Chzy&index=12)\n\nI think you have figured out most of the stuff yourself, but these are just my comments.", "created_utc": "1622740855.0", "edited": "False", "id": "h0gnvho", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_nri2d9", "parent_id": "t3_nri2d9", "score": "2", "subreddit": "eu4", "subreddit_id": "t5_2uqat"}, {"author": "MichaelTheSlav", "body": "It will migrate eith them.

Around 1590 increase autonomy in all your provinces. If I\u2019m correct you have to wait 20 years in between to change autonomy again. So after 20 years in 1610, once the age of absolutism is up, change the autonomy again, this time decrease it. It will grant you a hefty amount of starting absolutism.\n\nAfter that do a combination of harsh treatment and strengthen government if you can spare the mil points. Only apply harsh treatment to the cheapest rebels, at least until you get the age bonus for cheaper harsh treatment.\n\nThe age bonuses in the age of absolutism are quite nice. The highlights include: \u201350% harsh treatment cost, \u201350% autonomy change cooldown, +1 yearly absolutism, +5% admin efficiency. I haven\u2019t yet figured out what order you should take those, but all of them are potentially useful to obtain a lot of admin efficiency.\n\nIt is also very useful to have high crownland. When I play I always seize land from the estates as often as possible from the very beginning. I don\u2019t care if they revolt, the rebel stacks are small and easy to deal with. High crownland gives you max absolutism but also a constant increase at 60+ crownland. If you have enough crownland and some other bonuses you can even have 100 absolutism and still keep one or two estate privileges.", "created_utc": "1622183022.0", "edited": "False", "id": "gzqb45u", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_nmbi5g", "parent_id": "t1_gzoh0i9", "score": "1", "subreddit": "eu4", "subreddit_id": "t5_2uqat"}, {"author": "MichaelTheSlav", "body": "Yes.
