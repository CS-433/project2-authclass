As a fiction writer and essayist, I was in the habit of writing around 2000 words a day, just about every day. So, I set my history writing goal *much* lower, at 1000, with an absolute floor of 500 words every day. I did count productive exploratory writing (e.g. writing a few paragraphs in my research journal in order to decide how to frame a source) but I tried to at least hit 500 words on top of that. I wound up sticking to an average of 1000 a day, and finished the draft at 23K words in 23 days. The important part here was to just get words on paper. As far as what I wrote: I had a three-chapter plan, and while I didn't have an in-depth outline, I had a list of the eight or ten things I wanted to cover in each, along with a beginning and ending idea. In fiction writing, I'm a seat-of-my-pants writer, so this allowed me to use a more-organized form of what I was used to. \n\nAfter taking a day or two to go fishing, I started the second process. I reread my book and wrote down an outline of what I had written, especially noting how I had organized everything, and looking to see if there were any places where I had written about something twice, or not at all. Then I took that outline and rewrote it in the manner I wanted it to be. After a couple of days to research the things that I wanted to add or change, I started on the re-write process. For this part, I gave myself a goal of five pages OR six hours of work a day. Most days I was closer to ten pages in fewer hours, but again, I set my goal lower than what I thought I could do in order to not feel like I'd failed on a particularly hard writing day. \n\nIf you're a journalist, you should already have a developed skill of writing under a deadline.

Cook on low for eight to nine hours. High for four hours works but the texture is better on the low setting. I will also sometimes add a little more broth when it's finished.\n\nAlterations I've tested: 1 pound beef, 1 pound ground pork sausage, no beef but an au jus pack, no beef but an instant French Onion soup pack, no beef but shredded carrots and au jus or French Onion... or a combination of the above.

It's like a Cold Open to a movie or TV series.

Another example was from my Saltmarsh campaign -- after an eight-day storm, the PCs were enjoying a beautiful morning on the beach (two were fishers, one was a smuggler, one lived near the beach) when they saw a foundering longboat. They had to swim out to it while other PCs went to the town for help, and then they had to save the nearly-dead person in the boat and bring her ashore.

Since the party members failed their perception check, a farmer heading into town with a load of carrots noticed that there was what looked to be a lifeboat about a quarter mile out. The party managed to *Mend* some driftwood to make a raft, while a few others went into town for help. Inside the slowly sinking lifeboat was a teenage girl, sunburned and bruised, and apparently dead. They rolled her onto the raft where the cleric discovered she was barely alive, and the two on the raft got her back to the beach while two other party members rode the boat back. Just before they left on the lifeboat, a small group of dogfish (stats from \u201cShark Week\u201d on [D&D Beyond](https://www.dndbeyond.com/forums/dungeons-dragons-discussion/dungeon-masters-only/18383-shark-week?page=3)) began bumping into the boat, and the party had a short combat with them, fortunately evading the venomous spines that those shark relatives have. By the time they got her to the beach, some of the townsfolk were there, including her uncle, Lunkas Korrid of The Wicker Goat tavern.\n\nThe 18 year old girl and her 16 year old brother had been missing for well over a week, after going to the Alchemist House on a dare from a gang of Traditionalist kids. (Living with an uncle who was not only a Loyalist but a famous one was hard on them.) The two were captured and taken onboard a ship (not the Sea Ghost) into slavery but before long, one of the Aboleth horrors appeared to the crew. Perhaps it cast the *Mind Wipe* spell on her to make her forget she had seen it, perhaps she went a little mad, but when she recovers from her coma, she will have no memory of anything after turning up the road to the house, not even her escape. The presence of the horror was also what caused the eight- day storm and inadvertently gave her cover to flee in a lifeboat,\n\nThe party will be called to investigate the house. The council is keeping it quiet that she had cuff and chain bruises on her wrists and one ankle, and the town is already in a near-fever pitch about the latest story from the Alchemist House.

They largely declined after Rome's conquest of Greece, and though some Roman Emperors revived them or a version of them, those games also declined after the fall of the Roman Empire. Someone with a classical history background can better answer why the Olympic Games caught the imagination of the Romans and educated Industrial-age Scholars and Sports Fans better than I can.\n\nHowever, the modern Olympic Games date back to the late 19th century, and were largely the brainchild of Charles Pierre Fredy, Baron de Coubertin. He saw the modern games as a way of promoting sports and celebrating competition and the values of training. He also moved away from the then-popular British model of outdoor team sports to showcase the individual competitor. Not only did he help start the first Modern Olympics in 1896, he kept the enthusiasm going for the games in the early 1900s. With an education in the classics, he clearly called back to Roman and Greek celebrations of the individual competitor, and started a tradition that is still (more or less) going strong today. \n\nEDIT: I left a part of a sentence out when I was editing this post.

Several different schemes and plans existed to recruit indentured servants to immigrate in return for several (often seven) years' service. And of course, a significant portion of the new \"immigrants\" weren't there by choice, but they were also seen as a force to strengthen and grow the Colonies. As the settlers began to spread out into the Ohio and Mississippi River regions, the settlers began to come into conflict with the Indians, and that became a security issue as well. In 1757, Georgia passed a law addressing just these issues, saying that immigration was \"of the greatest importance to the safety of the British Empire in America that the Province of Georgia should be peopled with a Number of Inhabitants sufficient to repel any Invasion or Incroachment of foreign Powers, and to prevent any Incursion of the Indians.\u201d[1] \n\nAs the colonists moved into conflict with the Crown, this became an issue for the English as well. In addition to preventing the Colonies from becoming too strong, the King was worried about increased immigration, especially German immigration, as non-English settlers wouldn't have a strong loyalty to the English Crown.[2] In addition to a decree restricting Ohio Valley settlement (passed in 1763, rescinded in 1768) the Crown issued a decree in 1773 that barred the Colonies from passing their own laws regarding naturalization. At this point, the Crown was leery of anything the Colonies did that countermanded their authority, or conducted business that only the King should be able to do.[3] \n\nIt's also good to note that, not only was expansion an issue in the Revolution, it was one of the chief causes of the Civil War. Much of the violence in the 1850s, before war was declared, was over whether new territories would be \"Slave\" or \"Free\" states. \n\nSo, the short answer to your question is: The Colonists wanted to encourage any kind of immigration in order to build up their labor and their agricultural strength, as well as add to a large class of citizen defenders. The Crown opposed this, for the same reasons, especially when it became clear that a potential rebellion was brewing. \n\nReferences:\n\n[1] Gershon, Livia, \"Immigration and National Security in George Washington\u2019s Day,\" *JSTOR Daily*, 7 March 2017, Retrieved from https://daily.jstor.org/immigration-and-national-security-in-george-washingtons-day/\n\n[2] \"The Declaration of Independence -- Grievances Annotated.\" *America in Class: Making the Revolution 1763-1791 Primary Source Collection.* Retrieved from https://americainclass.org/sources/makingrevolution/rebellion/text8/decindep.pdf\n\n[3] Bell, J.L. \"The Issue of Naturalization Laws and What Really Mattered.\" *Boston 1775*.

TTYs (teletypes) were a step up from telegraph keys as they had a keyboard, though the ones I trained on and used from '91 to '95 only had upper-case letters, and you had to hit a key to switch between letters and numbers/ symbols. The procedures used developed from those used on CW (constant wave -- Morse Code) circuits, and we had a bunch of ways to correct errors or request them, depending on how we were communicating and with whom. Because both Morse code and TTY circuits can be cumbersome, NATO, Allied groups, and various communication services shortened as much as they absolutely could.\n\nFor example, if you were on your ship (let's say \"BVRX,\"), and you were sending a line to someone on the USS REDDIT (RDDT,) asking the operator to repeat a message labeled \"061040Z OCT 91\" you'd say, using the Z signal \"ZDK\" asking for a retransmission). This is what you start typing on your teletype:\n\n>RDDT DE BVRX INT ZDK 061040Z K\n\nAs you're typing that line (the 'K' at the end is the same as saying \"OVER\" in a voice channel) your Chief comes up to you and says \"Actually... the message we need is from 1030, not 1040.\" Since you haven't finished typing it yet, this is what you end up sending to the channel:\n\n>RDDT DE BVRX INT ZDK 061040Z EEEEEEEE 061030Z K\n\nThe eight Es indicate an error in the word or group of letters immediately before. If you had already sent the message, you could send the message again, with the prosign \"C\" after the identifying Date-Time Group (the 061040Z OCT 91 indicates a message written at 1040 Greenwich Mean Time, on October 6th, 1991)  to indicate that the new message is a correction of the old one.\n\nIf you knew there was an error but didn't have the correction, you would still error-out the message:\n\n>RDDT DE BVRX INT ZDK 061040Z EEEEEEEE AR\n\nThe AR in that message means \"Out,\" as in \"I have ceased transmission and do not expect a reply.\n\nOne other set of prosigns that helped: WA and WB, which meant \"Word After\" and \"Word Before.\" You could use these to request a correction (\"RDDT DE BVRX INT WA SEND K\") or to send one (BVRX DE RDDT WA SEND NEWS K\") Note: the parenthesis and quotes are only used in my explanation. They, and indeed any punctuation not strictly necessary, were never included.\n\nI'm not certain when these procedures were enacted, but they were used at least from the Korean Conflict on to the 1990s. The idea of typing a code to indicate a correction, though, is the same.  As for the second part of your question: Depending on the sensitivity of the message, the classification of the circuit, and the type of message being sent, there were ways to check the message, such as transmitting a word count at the end of the message. This would be verified by the receiving station.\n\nThere are other prosigns and signals that can be used to tell the other operator, in as few letters as possible (this was in the days of 50 and 75 baud circuits) what you need to correct, or what you need correcting. The reference Allied Communications Pub 126 (ACP 126(C) UNCLASSIFIED) is the main reference for this. And though this is anecdotal, I can verify that the Radiomen on my first two ships were drilled on them so much that, even though I haven't operated a Navy comms circuit as my main job in 25 years (I moved on to the IT side of the house) I only had to look up one of the prosigns above. Everything else is ingrained in my memory, some of it in 5-position punch-code.\n\nSources:\n\n[ACP 126(C) MAY 1989](http://www.navybmr.com/study%20material/ACP126C.pdf)\n\n[Q and Z signals](http://www.zerobeat.net/qrp/zsiglist.html).", "created_utc": "1601258020.0", "edited": "1601258216.0", "id": "g6wuuv0", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_j0qxfe", "parent_id": "t3_j0qxfe", "score": "22", "subreddit": "AskHistorians", "subreddit_id": "t5_2ssp3"}, {"author": "bovisrex", "body": "Ego eram Catolico quod esset bonum", "created_utc": "1601168098.0", "edited": "False", "id": "g6r7lt8", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_j0dx2d", "parent_id": "t1_g6qp52o", "score": "3", "subreddit": "Conservative", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh6p"}, {"author": "bovisrex", "body": "I like to keep them on hand for drop-in players, or replacement PCs.

(Eg. \"We need to pay quickly and leave\" sounds less urgent than \"We need to quickly pay and leave.\") \n\nI will say that the exact opposite to what you propose happened with American English in the 19th Century. Noah Webster lobbied hard to simplify American spelling; a lot of spelling differences between American English and British English are due to his work. (Words such as \"Color\" instead of \"Colour\" are examples of his simplification.) As Gertrude Hildreth put it in her article \"Noah Webster: Crusader for American Literacy,\" he used his *Blue-Back Speller* and famous dictionary to remove class distinctions in American English and to promote literacy. (Hildreth 375) By standardizing and simplifying spelling, he hoped to ensure that rural and frontier Americans spoke and read the same language as those in the cities. \"[He] was zealous in his campaign to regularize orthography of the American language and to simplify spelling where this was practical. He recognized that with correct and consistent orthography much time that children spent in learning to read and write could be saved.\" (Hildreth 375) Karl F Kaestle writes in a review of E.  Jennifer Monaghan's *A Common Heritage: Noah Webster's Blue-Back Speller* that Webster sought to create a distinct and uniform American English, and that many of his rules for simplifying the way it was written and illustrating how it was pronounced are still used today. (Kaestle 659) There were political reasons for this as well; he was an ardent Federalist, and while he didn't want frontier parts of America and its territories cut off (areas typically associated with Jeffersonian Democrats), he also didn't want them to gain too much leverage, either. But by and large, he wished to simplify the language to make it easier to learn and read. In fact, there were many other simplified spellings of his that failed to catch on.\n\nEDIT: Added a phrase for clarification of my point.\n\nSources:\n\nHildreth, Gertrude, \"Noah Webster Crusader for American Literacy,\" *The Elementary School Journal*, Vol. 59, No. 7 (Apr., 1959), pp. 375-379\n\nKaestle, Carl F, \"A Common Heritage: Noah Webster's Blue-Back Speller,\" *Journal of American History*, Dec 1983, Vol. 70 Issue 3, p659-660", "created_utc": "1597890535.0", "edited": "1597891299.0", "id": "g2682zh", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_ico3xu", "parent_id": "t3_ico3xu", "score": "34", "subreddit": "AskHistorians", "subreddit_id": "t5_2ssp3"}, {"author": "bovisrex", "body": "That's not Cancel Culture at all.

One of the varieties that developed over the centuries was the variety used for popcorn, and they did indeed pop it. Popped kernels have been found in New Mexico that were perhaps 5000 years old. There is evidence of popped corn from Inca settlements to Aztec and up to the Iroquois, and while it might not be true that one of the Indians that dealt with the Pilgrims brought a basket of popcorn to dinner (despite the high mark that a paper stating this fact, written by this historian in Third Grade, received) they did introduce it to the Europeans. \n\nHistory of Maize: Charles C.

He was a Quaker in the early to mid 18th century who was quite theatrical in his protests and demonstrations against slavery. While he didn't change the laws in Pennsylvania during his lifetime, the Quakers did eventually follow his lead and excluded slaveholders from their meetings; eighteen years later, slaveholding was abolished in the colony. Considering the amount of work Quakers did in the following century, both as Abolitionists and as Underground Railroad \"Conductors,\" it's arguable that he helped get that (ahmm) train in motion. \n\nBenjamin Lay first encountered the horrors of slavery in Barbados. When he moved to Pennsylvania in the 1730s, he found slavery there as well, and began staging protests against it, as well as boycotts against tobacco and sugar, primarily produced by slave labor. He was chased out of a few places and even disowned by the Quaker establishment of the time, thanks to his love of the Cynic philosophers and his desire to speak bluntly and clearly about the evils he saw men doing. However, his words and work had an effect, and eventually, in 1758, the Quakers began the process of disowning slaveholders. \n\nMarcus Rediker released a well-reviewed book three years ago about this little-known figure in Colonial history, and he also wrote [an article for *The Smithsonian*](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/quaker-comet-greatest-abolitionist-never-heard-180964401/) around the same time. \n\n\nMarcus Rediker. *The Fearless Benjamin Lay: The Quaker Dwarf Who Became the First Revolutionary Abolitionist.*  Boston : Beacon Press, 2017. 212 pp. $26.95 cloth.", "created_utc": "1595653947.0", "edited": "False", "id": "fz64jal", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_hxc75h", "parent_id": "t3_hxc75h", "score": "3", "subreddit": "AskHistorians", "subreddit_id": "t5_2ssp3"}, {"author": "bovisrex", "body": "Almost six years ago, NPR imagined how they would have covered the burning of Washington.

However, they can be limited in their scope. The fable of the Blind Men and the Elephant is a good example, since each \"Primary Source\" reports, quite faithfully, that the elephant is like a snake or a tree or a wall, yet because a comprehensive picture hasn't been assembled yet, they are individually not as correct as a well-researched and vetted secondary source would be. Additionally, they can suffer from the bias of the source creator just as much as a secondary source can. Perhaps General Smith was passed over for promotion in favor of General Jones. Later, he became a scholar or historian, and while most of his work was accurate, his primary-source account of the battles he fought in show how General Smith was the true hero, dismissing or downplaying the contributions of his rival.\n\nThey also may be unintentionally flawed due to further investigation or the development of additional information. Think of any major crime where the initial suspect was freed after the true culprit was caught. You could find a contemporary primary source, accurate for the time it was written, stating the reasons why Suspect A (or even Convicted Criminal A) was considered the perpetrator, and even a good-faith primary source written at the time will be considered incorrect based on further investigation. In the scope of world history, involvement of certain powers, people, or organizations might not be known at the time that otherwise-accurate primary sources were created.

I probably retained 35-40% of it. \n\nA few years later, I took a college class on US History 1865-Present. By then, my retention of the book I'd read had fallen, but that class reinforced a lot of that information, so I found myself remembering more things about that book. In addition, it added more facts onto the framework I already had. \n\nI've since read several books on Civil War History, visited battlefields and museums, watched documentaries, and taken a class specifically on the US Civil War, as well as classes that covered that time period in addition to other eras. Each time, I'm adding more things onto the framework I had, rather than just absorbing everything like a sponge. When I recently read another Civil War book, I found that I already knew about a quarter of what was in there, and because of that, I knew where to put the other three-quarters of new information. The outline and a lot of the details were already there, and I just added more substance to what I knew, in addition to refreshing myself on what I'd learned.\n\nIt also helps to take notes, lots of notes. Depending on the quality of reading (is it densely packed with numbers and names, or is it more narrative-style writing?) I will sometimes write notes as I'm reading (in pencil, especially if I'm making notes in the book) or I will jam an index card in between the pages and go back to it after I finish the section. On e-readers I will highlight a sentence (rarely ever making a note at the time) and go back afterwards. This gets better with practice, especially once you become more familiar with certain eras/ subjects. If I'm doing this for a paper or project, I will spend ten or fifteen minutes at the end of the day typing the best parts of my notes (usually all of them) into an Evernote or Word document.\n\nAnd you didn't ask this question, but the answer to whether you should go back to school for a history degree is **YES.**", "created_utc": "1592682947.0", "edited": "False", "id": "fvgx6s2", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_hcn077", "parent_id": "t3_hcn077", "score": "10", "subreddit": "AskHistorians", "subreddit_id": "t5_2ssp3"}, {"author": "bovisrex", "body": "Four quadrants.

Then they can decide to move on if they want, and that second language will be a lot easier. \n\nA Python programmer will have a bit of a learning curve when first starting to learn Java, or C++. But it won't be nearly as difficult as if he or she had no programming knowledge at all. You'll already know the reasons why you have to do some things, like flow control, data structure, exception handling, file access, etc., and picking up a new language means learning how that particular language does it. \n\nThose people who said \"Learn Python on your own, and Java in a class\" were right. Keep studying it this summer, because it will still teach you programming concepts. The problem most new programmers have isn't learning the syntax and commands, it's learning how to address a problem and conceive of a solution. Studying just about any modern language will teach you that. \n\nFifty years or more ago, schools made language learners study Latin before learning any romance language, on the idea that if you know the root language, you'll have an easier time with its descendants. They're not wrong, but for the most part, Latin is of most use to History and Science students. It might be easier to learn Latin and then Spanish or French or Italian, but if you're around Spanish speakers, or French speakers, you should learn the one that will come quickest and easiest, the one you can begin using from the first week.\n\nThe best way to learn something is to use it and practice it. The book you mentioned is a great way to get you using it. Try using it for everything. When you get to college, you'll have a leg up on people who've never met an *if... then* or *while* statement.

One day, one of those characters might tell you that there's more to his or her story, and you'll keep pushing on.\n\nAs far as not knowing how to go on, there are ways to work through that block You can boil most stories to a simple formula: A character wants something, but the antagonist won't let him have it. The antagonist might be a person or a monster or an elemental force, or the character's own struggles (such as how my depression is keeping me from working on my own story right now) but a lot of drama and tension is, at its core, this formula. Keep extending it... Character takes steps to get what he needs, nearly takes it, and something happens to make it worse, or nearly impossible. Or, the antagonist gets it first and now the story is about getting to him and getting whatever it is, whether an actual thing, or something more nebulous, like credit for a project or the respect of another. \n\nAnd every time it looks like your character is about to succeed, kick him or her in the face and make it even harder. There's a common trope in movies where a couple is about to kiss for the first time and then a friend barges in, or something falls over and disturbs them, or any number of things.

After clearing out the basement of the [Lich Zaldara](https://www.dmsguild.com/product/220572/Cellar-of-Death?src=cab_col) they investigated a report of smugglers in [Tiryiki Anchorage](https://www.dmsguild.com/product/220591/Encounters-in-Port-Nyanzaru) and found out that, rather than the usual smuggled goods, there was a Vampire Spawn, an Ambassador of the Blood Knight, tucked away. One of the party (three rogues, a monk, and a war cleric) took the bronze cloak clasp from her body, without knowing that it was a tracking device. The main rogue (we'll call him GF for GoldenFingers) gave it to the Short Thief (ST) when they divvied up the loot.\n\nNext session starts with them hiring Akaza to take them to Firefang and elsewhere, and while they were shopping for goods in the Grand Souk, an assassin sneak-attacked ST, laid him gently on the ground, took the clasp, and said \"The Blood Knight sends his regards.\" Clumsy Rogue (CR) fired his longbow at the assassin... in a crowd... and rolled a 1, which resulted in the arrow landing in the right buttock of a fruit vendor, who promptly started screaming for the constables. Most of the party 'noped' out, though the wounded one had to be escorted back to Kaya's Rest. In the confusion, GF slipped up to the assassin and pickpocketed him, stealing the cloak clasp back, without knowing it's a tracker. At least twice since then, he's joked about how upset the Blood Knight must be, knowing that he stole the thing he sent his man to steal. I have to laugh with him, but for a different reason. I'd already been playing with the idea of fleshing out the character of the Blood Knight, but now, it's a must. He and his vampires are also looking for the Soulmonger, since it interferes with their ability to change humanoids into their kin, but he absolutely despises interference. \n\nThey hired four rowers/ porters and their guide (mostly from selling the tiara found on the Vampire Spawn's body) and made their way to the tower. The trip up was relatively straightforward... they creatively incinerated the stirge cave, and freed the Aaracockra. GF decided to steal a golden belt off of a distracted Pterafolk (I allowed it because I want that legend to spread in town, and make every up-and-coming thief want to test himself against 'Golden Fingers.') CR fired the first open shot of the final battle and rolled another 1; unfortunately, he didn't have another bowstring, and he apparently sucks with a short sword. Meanwhile, Akaza had stayed below thanks to her acrophobia, though she did manage to climb up to the first level of the tower when a wandering party of ghouls arrived. \n\nThe next session will start with them getting down from the tower, which might be tricky, since their intel on the tower said there were at least 12 Pterafolk warriors, and they've only killed 6. Back on the boat, things will look normal, but while they were gone, a lieutenant of the Blood Knight crept aboard, turned one of the four rower/ porters into a new vampire spawn, and mind-wiped the other three so they have no clue it happened. In my campaign, vampire victims take 2-5 days to turn, and during this time they begin to show signs of their vampiric nature. Because of the Soulmonger, though, this victim is turning into a horrific hybrid called a Jungle Vampire, a mix of vampire spawn and the elemental evil energy of the jungle. He'll be a little slower, but he is also growing pseudopods which, if they hit in combat, inflict a fungal rot that does 3d6 fungus, mold, and necrotic damage, and 2d6 per day until removed.

All is well and good... all had played D&D though a couple had never played 5E before.

So, I didn't want to cancel on the two that did show up, so I helped them with their characters and then pulled out a couple pages from a collection of one-page adventures (from [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/8j4geh/one_page_adventures_22_adventures_for_most/) post by /u/Drasha1) to make sure the new player knew what was going on. They wound up finding a small fishing village that was being attacked by Sahuagin, so they charged in and saved a couple of children that were digging for clams and periwinkles in a tidal pool. Afterward, they found out that the Sahuagin raids had started when a pirate ship had anchored off the coast a month back and raided their temple, along with villages further down the coast, and they were begged by the party to go to the ship and retrieve their holy relics. The players decided to stop there and wait for the whole group to get together.\n\nSaturday, I met with the other two players and did the same thing... briefed them on the campaign, answered questions, and helped with their characters. Then I ran a short one-hour adventure for the two of them, except for them, they started the adventure locked up on a pirate ship just off the coast, and when they started prying loose the planks that made up a hastily-built wall in their cell, the other prisoner of the pirates, a baby kraken, started trying to bust through. Eventually, they were able to rush, dash, and punch a few pirates and escape to the longboat, where with the help of another fleeing pirate (his reasons for fleeing link to the greater campaign) they headed toward a fishing village on the coast. Bonus: I was trying to figure out a hook to make the second group want to go back, once the entire group got together. In the smoke and confusion of drunk pirates trying to deal with a baby kraken trying to escape, one of them decided that, even though he had his backpack and gear, he was not going to leave without his armor and short bow. (\"I just *bought* that stuff, man!\") The friendly pirate talked him into leaving, eventually, with a lot of swearing and threats, and they made their way ashore.

There might be times when I want to do a speed-run on a low-tier Fractal or boss event, but nine times out of ten, I like to explore and push myself, and not worry about only hitting 75% of the benchmark at Snow Crows or Discretize, or having to re-do a mechanic because I fat-fingered something or briefly forgot how to do it. (Or have to re-do something because one of my teammates did the same.) I know my way isn't for everyone, but it's my favorite way to enjoy the game.

It would be like, having your detective follow a trail for someone named 'Bobby,' and the clues all circumstantially point to a man named Bob.

The false one is much more dramatic, though, or it points to a false hypothesis that the sleuth is developing. Most people don't like to figure out they're wrong, so once they've put a couple of pieces together, they will gladly charge down that path to a dead end, ignoring real clues that come up along the way.\n\nOr perhaps they find a clue and then it's destroyed. Or the person who gives it to them is discredited. Maybe they get a good tip from 'Mrs Y' that 'Mr X' committed the crime, but then they find out that 'Mrs Y' had an old grudge against 'Mr X' and thereby has a motive to get him in trouble, and this knowledge sends the sleuths off in another direction. But, it turns out at the end that 'Mr X' really did do it. \n\nThe thing that a lot of clues should do in a mystery is add to the conflict. Each one might be a little piece of the puzzle, but it must cause some sort of problem when it's discovered or followed. Each answer should raise at least one more question.

For my current attack on Latin American Spanish, I'm using *Complete Spanish Step-by-Step* and Duolingo.\n(The five lessons can vary. When I used his method for Italian, I did the first seven lessons in the book I had, since #6 covered 'Essere' and #7 covered 'Avere,' two of the most important verbs. I usually interpret this as 'two weeks in a grammar/ language learning book.')\n\n2. Use flash cards occasionally as regular practice (I will use them to warm up before working through a lesson), but mostly during what he called 'hidden moments,' those times when you're waiting in line or on hold or otherwise can't do anything else. When I learned Italian, I was working as a Network Administrator, so every time I rebooted a computer (something I did a *lot*) I would pull out my flashcards. After a few months, I decided to see how much time I spent on flash card practice, and I learned that I was nearly doubling the amount of time I studied, even though I barely used them during my formal practice. \n\n3. After you've done your introductory lessons, find something written in your target language... young adult books, newspaper articles, blog posts, etc. Start reading it, dictionary and notebook close at hand. Work the words you look up into your regular practice. Also, add in TV shows, songs, and other fun things. Keep moving forward on all three tequniques.\n\nThe takeaway from this that I got was to make sure you had at least a basic grounding in the language first, and then mix lessons and book practice with fun stuff like watching movies, listening to/ translating songs, and talking to people.

My information was compromised in two attacks on public databases, and there may be more that I don't know of. And if we've learned anything about how lax government employees are when it comes to network and information security, there could be more to come and there is nothing I can do about it. \n\nFrom a criminal standpoint, it makes sense. Why take the trouble of getting into an individual's bank/ credit card/ social security account, only to find that they have nothing for your trouble, when you can attempt to get into a government database and have millions of accounts to pick and choose from? The more information they collect, they more they have to work with.

Two, perhaps you're doing something now that is legal in a state or country you're in, but not in a state or country you go to, and they find out about it.

I saw it as someone who had seen too much and experienced too much, little of it by his choice. If *anguisettes* are truly rare, that means that most of the inhabitants of Valerian House only tolerate what is done to them. They do it to finish their marque, and perhaps only after that for the money or because of inertia. Perhaps I'm reading too much into it, but I felt Didier was someone to be pitied a little, at least in Chapter 14.\n\n* I really want to know more about the Master of the Strait. Until now, I haven't seen any direct evidence of magic or fantasy, and while I like low-magic secondary worlds, I'm excited to see what surfaces. \n\n* I had trouble accepting how Delaunay sold Ph\u00e8dre to an enemy, both because it destroyed the last bit of respect I had for him (and I didn't have much by this point) and because I don't understand how a single night, or even a few nights, will help him gain anything from a person who quite obviously hates him. If he were someone like the men we've met in his salons, I could understand a little more, but it looks like he's set her up with someone who not only won't give away anything, and will hate her for her attachment to his enemy. \n\nAll in all, I can barely wait to move on ahead.

Did I mention I was foolish? I feel a little stupid just typing that. I'm breathlessly awaiting the third, and I plan on preordering this one as well.

I almost went right on to the next book, but by this point I'd decided that I wanted to black out my bingo card in six months. Still, I think that's next up on my Kindle. A few fellow readers are insisting on it.\n\n*Low Town* (Daniel Polansky) -- Awesome book, though a little too cynical and depressing. Noir can be tricky, though, and I think he handles it pretty well. I'm intrigued enough to want to read the other books in the series, and it gave me hopes for my own police procedural fantasy novel.\n\n*Gorky Park* (Martin Cruz Smith) -- My current fantasy novel turned into a Police Procedural, and so I decided to go back and read some of the classics that I'd missed. This might not exactly be fantasy, but Mr Smith wrote this about the USSR for an American audience, and therefore had to create a convincing alien world that his readers would still understand and care about. Also, while the 'whodunnit' is pretty damn obvious, it's fun to watch the detective trying to convince others about that.\n\n*Spirits Rising* (Krista D Ball) -- I've been meaning to read more of her stuff, and this dropped into my lap from her recent sale. Verdict:  Great, but I wish it were longer. Also, I take issue with its label as \"Urban Fantasy.\" I grew up in a town probably twice the size of where Rachel lives... it sure didn't feel 'urban.'\n\nI briefly thought about trying to finish last year's card (I neglected to participate last year) in the next six months, but I think I'm going to take it easy and work in a lot of my other fictional interests... psychological science fiction, mysteries, and maybe some horror as well.\n", "created_utc": "1475300546.0", "edited": "False", "id": "d89ao20", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_557kmw", "parent_id": "t3_557kmw", "score": "1", "subreddit": "Fantasy", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qknd"}, {"author": "bovisrex", "body": "I'm a fan of sipping Fernet Branca out of an ice cold glass after the day's writing. \n\nAlso, I must confess that I had not heard of your books until now.

It definitely got better. Also, this has some of the best romantic scenes of any of the three. I know this because I was reading this over breakfast and my wife told me I was rubbing her knee under the table; I didn't even know I was doing that. Ah well. Anyway, great book. Plot holes you could sail a frigate through, and there's an express telegram from Deus ex Machina, Inc., toward the end, but it's still a fun ride.\n\n**Mahabharata** -- Abrg. by Khrishna Dharma. I thought for a long time about using this \"abridgment\" (it's still about a thousand pages) as my Military History square, but since a lot of people on this planet consider it an essential Scripture, I decided not to. This book also took me a long time to read (I started on 4 July, and took a break between parts 1 & 2) but it was more than more than worth it. The battle scenes were wonderfully epic, and the sense of people being pulled one way and another by fate, destiny, or poorly-though-through oaths and promises was thick enough to chew on. This book was responsible for a lot of weird epic dreams, and I can see why it's been an epic for a few thousand years.\n\n**The Goblin Emperor** -- Katherine Addison (Novel Someone Read for 2015 Bingo) -- This was highly recommended by u/lrich1024; I think if she'd been closer she would have beat me over the head with it. I actually think I need to read it again. The beginning and the end were great. The middle... well, my memories of reading it tell me I was bored in a lot of spots, but then again, one of my favorite things about the book was how some of the major plot points started so quietly and suddenly that I had to back up to make sure I'd just read what I thought I'd just read. The voice the story was told in was addictive and alluring as well. This is on my reread list for later.\n\n**On Wings of Song**, Thomas Disch (Flying Protagonist) -- Okay, maybe it's a stretch since the flying is more like astral projection, but the entire premise of the book is about men and women trying to cut themselves free of a convincingly well written dystopian earth and soar into the heavens. The first half of this book is a solid 4 stars, but then I just limped through the second half. Still, I can't not-recommend it. The description of the power of music, and the utter debasement the main character puts himself through for someone he loves, is palpable. \n\n**Darkfever** -- Karen Marie Moning (Romantic Fantasy) Wow. My wife reads a lot of paranormal romance, and this series has intrigued me since back when we were talking and thinking about dating, so I finally decided to start reading it. Perhaps it's not as romantic as a lot of romances I've read, but that factor was definitely there. And the story... it really does grab you by the short hairs and pull you along. I think I read it in two days, and if a friend hadn't been visiting, I would have read it even more quickly. The biggest complaint I've seen others make is that the protagonist is shallow and insipid, and while I can see that, I can also see her character slowly changing by the end of the book, and thankfully *not* changing instantly after an encounter with magic or the unknown or a life-threatening situation. She's different at the end, but she's still the same character. \n\nI'm halfway finished with *The Obelisk Gate* which will punch my 2016 square, and my other books are plotted out:  *Ash* (Mary Gentle, Military Fantasy), *Inda* (Sherwood Smith, AMA Author), and *Lowtown* (Daniel Polansky, Dark Fantasy).

There were a few spots where I thought the plot got a little contrived, and a few things that I thought were unnecessary, but the book itself was unique and very well-written. It also had some nice things to say about genetics, stories, and memory.\n\n\n*Dragonsong* **(1970s)** Somehow, I never read the Harper Hall books. I fixed that. This book was decent (if I remember right, I think I might have liked *Dragonquest* better) but it was an excellent character study. I'm looking forward to the second one.\n\n\n*Black Sun Rising* **(Science Fantasy)** I had this book in the early 90s, but I loaned it to someone on my first ship and then transferred before I got it back from him. Finally picked it up, and damn, is this good. I give Ms Friedman extra props for introducing a sympathetic evil character who works with the main party, but doesn't lose his dark side (or worse, get explained away as 'just misunderstood'). \n\n\n*The Pastel City* **(Less than 3K ratings)** I'm actually reading the entire *Viriconium* book, but I counted the first novel for Bingo. This book reads like high-quality Eternal Champion, with a dose of William S Burroughs and Mervyn Peake stirred into the pot for added insanity. It's an enjoyable book, and works well as a stand-alone. (I also read the second book, *Storm of Wings*, and that book dialed up the crazy and lowered the quality I think.)\n\n*The Dispossessed* **(Award Winner)** By far my favorite LeGuin book, and this is coming from the kid who read the Earthsea trilogy at least three times before graduation. This book works as a critique, both good and bad, of anarchism, capitalism, communism, and just about every other -ism that was popular in the late 1960s, and it's still very relevant. I especially like how she wasn't afraid to show problems in the 'perfect' anarchist communal-type society, as it made it one of the most realistic eutopias I've ever read. (Yes, eutopia... means 'good place.' 'Utopia' means 'no place.' But that's another discussion.) \n\n\n*The Science Fiction Hall of Fame, Vol I* **(Five Fantasy Stories)**  For those who think that Sci Fi doesn't count as fantasy, I'll list the stories \"Born of Man and Woman,\" \"It's a *Good* Life,\" \"A Martian Odyssey,\" \"Mars is Heaven!,\" and \"That Only a Mother\" as being more fantasy than science-fiction. I also whole-heartedly recommend this book, and might go so far as to say that it is required reading. Some of the stories are a little dated, but more than half of them still pack quite a punch. (\"Huddling Place,\" for one, is frighteningly prescient. Not to mention the 'B' story in \"The Little Black Bag.\") Please, get this. Read a story a day, like sipping a fine scotch, and enjoy a trip back to where we came from.\n\n\nRight now I'm reading the Inuit fantasy *The Calling (Alaana's Way 1)* as a non-Western-based fantasy, and *Nod Away* as my Graphic Novel, which will put me at thirteen books.

This genre is not for epic quests, groups made up of tokens from strangely-alike-yet-superficially-different races fulfilling a prophecy, or farmboy orphan demigods learning that the obscure accordian left by a white-hair'd stranger is in fact the object that will destroy evil and usher in a world of Peace, Prosperity, and Infinite Polka.\n\nOne thing that is rarely mentioned, however, is how Sword and Sorcery treats magic. At best, it's cumbersome and unpredictable, but usually, it's dark, forboding, and evil, the workings of immortal sorcerers and demons. It's usually a good quick fix but the ultimate consequences are horrible for all involved. (I'm thinking of the sorcerer in *The Hour of the Dragon*, or Elric's sword Stormbringer.) Contrast that with the happy magic that shows up in a lot of epic fantasy. It shows that Sword and Sorcery authors have greater faith in human strength, skill, and ingenuity, than mystic powers and the blessings of the gods.
