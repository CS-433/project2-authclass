For example, on a walk I listened to a chapter of the book I'm reading in German. I thought I understood it just fine and could have told you two words I was very proud I'd picked up from listening. I decided to read the chapter anyway, though, since I wanted to actually read the whole book and jot down the new words and syntax I was introduced to here and there. I jotted down about *30* words. I didn't even notice I hadn't understood them while listening. I still had gotten the gist, but I got a better understanding looking up those words as I went and actually paying attention to them. Likewise, I was more aware of things like attributive adjective endings, something I don't hear terribly well still (was that an m or n at the end?). Even when I read extensively, looking up little or nothing as I go, I pick up more words and linguistic detail in a reading session than I do in the same amount of listening time. \n\nReading allows for appropriate changes in pace, pauses, quick rereads of the previous phrase or paragraph when something doesn't make sense, a quick dictionary consult, etc. These are all great aids to building understanding that are harder to do with audio. When I get lost in the *Tatort Geschichte* podcast (well above my level, but usually understandable), sometimes my misunderstanding stems from something several minutes prior. In a book, I can just flip back and skim for a second to find the problem area. On a podcast, I have to hunt for it and am not always successful; I either don't find it or I end up listening to longer sections than I need to. \n\nI don't totally agree with your claim that listening is harder to master than reading: it depends on the kind of listening and the kind of reading. Podcasts and audiobooks are very easy to listen to; there's limited dialect use, slang, mumbling, interruptions, or background noise. Going to dinner with a bunch of German native speakers and there being four different conversations going at the same time -- definitely more challenging, but also a much more rare opportunity. Likewise: reading a graded reader... easy! Reading Goethe.... not so much. \n\nFinally, I feel the need to point out that literacy involves a lot more than just decoding (what you called understanding the orthography) and that even mere decoding requires quite a lot of practice before it becomes something done with automaticity and fluency. Despite using essentially the same alphabet as English, my reading in Spanish was pretty labored and slow in the first couple years. Now it's nearly as fast as my English reading. German is still pretty slow compared to my English at this point -- and on Harry Potter-level material, no less -- but it's getting better *because I practice*.

I'm 5'5, on the low side of moderately active, and currently 122 pounds trying to get back to 118. I lose on 1700/day. I gain and lose the same five pounds every year or two, so this is something I've done with success many, many times before.

That doesn't make me *more native* in some way. Education is completely unrelated to native-speaker status.\n\nThe CEFR exists to place foreigners appropriately in schools and jobs and to ensure that immigrants know enough of the language to at least be able to do the bare minimum with regards to government forms and such in the country. It does *not* test native status. Instead, it tests what one can *do* in a language, with a specific focus on certain tasks necessary for jobs, school, and citizenship, requiring more advanced thinking, literacy, and vocabulary skill as the levels increase -- not *just* language fluency. One often-tested task is a professional email, for example. Was my great-grandma less native because email *didn't exist* when she was alive? Of course not. There were personal letters, but the fact is, she didn't participate in that kind of correspondence as much as other relatives who had had more education did. The upper CEFR levels *must* test if a candidate can do more complex  academic and professional tasks in the language, which, by default, involves testing those tasks in addition to the language itself. \n\nThe CEFR is a handy leveling system for those of us who like talking about language learning, but it is not the one true indicator of fluency.

Investing *more* time and money wouldn't have made my situation better. (Many years later, I'm taking a stab at Thai again, but this time there are more and better online resources available, and my goal is just B1 comprehension; I'm not even going to try to speak.

There are generally some big differences in the  type of linguistic skill they have in each language. For example, indiginous languages and dialects that could arguably be another language are the ones they are least likely to be literate in or know academic terms in. Often, these were taught by grandparents who are either still in the home country or no longer living, and they consequently get used sparingly here. They are least likely to use slang in the extra language they learned in school. They generally become academically and colloquially fluent on English (I work with a lot of teen arrivals, so those seven hours a day of English in high school really pay off; adult arrivals often have to go right to work and don't get such intense exposure or direct instruction). \n\nInternet polyglots are a whole different monster. They tend more towards bragging and selling, playing off the erroneous assumption that language learning is *hard* (but it's easy and fast if you pay them $600!) and that \"traditional\" methods are ineffective.  What language learning *really* is is *time consuming*.  While some methods (not to be confused with tools) might have a slight edge over others when it comes to speed or accent reduction, every respected method will work with sufficient time and consistent effort. \n\nSo... polyglottism for the sake of polyglottism?

When I reach a milestone earlier than expected, that's cool. When I reach it later than expected, well, that's cool, too.

I'd have a hard deadline of B2 by summer, and I'd have to adjust my daily practice time accordingly to make that happen, so if I were not progressing *enough* on 90 minutes a day, then I'd have to carve out more time from my social life, my Reddit relaxation time, my NL novel reading, etc. to make that happen. When I was studying Spanish in college, I had to improve enough to be ready for the next class and to ultimately pass the fluency\u00b9 exam that would lead to my credential.

I start with learning syntax, which involves learning all the most common words and conjugations along with the practice sentences. As I generally have some kind of textbook to guide my progress, I do get some word lists to learn early on which I can pick up through flashcards or just repeated exposure (I've relied largely on the latter for German; I was a big time flashcard afficionado back when I learned Spanish. As far as I can tell, my vocabulary acquisition progress hasn't suffered). I include listening and reading practice, at a comprehensible level if available. If the language has a different writing system, I drill that early on. I don't try to converse or write naturally/spontaneously until I'm past A2, but I do speak and write in more structured situations with feedback, and I often read aloud (after listening to a native speaker read the text in the early stages). \n\nIt's all there; it's just a matter of time to actually master things. I might hear/read a lot of subjunctive early on, for example, get to a point of understanding it, but not actually learn to use it until later, and I'm okay with that. If every time I get introduced to something, I drop everything to try and master that or decide to add *more* study time because I'm impatient to master it, I won't accomplish anything but burnout. I trust that the textbooks will get to everything, and I study grammar in the order it's presented. Sometimes I'll get to something in the textbook and realize I'd already picked that up from repeated exposure and only need to fine tune it rather than learn from scratch (relative pronouns and Genitiv were among those skills in German). \n\nAt B1, it's really a game of review to deepen command over grammar and syntax and a lot of time broadening my vocabulary through reading and listening followed by writing and speaking using the vocabulary that I just learned. I make a point of writing/speaking in the syntax structures I struggle with. \n\nIt *is* neverending, which is part of the appeal. But I don't feel like it's *escalating* or overwhelming, possibly because I have a limited amount of time to work on it. I have 90 minutes a day to dedicate to focused German study. I spend 30-45 minutes a day in Spanish (not studying at this time; just maintaining through listening, reading, and daily conversations at work). Thai is barely on the radar at the moment, but I throw in some listening practice when I can. I think I'll reach B2 in German sometime around summer. Comprehension-wise, I'm apparently already there or very close (based on some tests, the levels of texts I read easily, and some teacher feedback). I think C1 is very doable for me within three years, maybe sooner if I find more opportunities for regular speaking practice. I've been C1 in Spanish and will be again when I decide I want to put in the time, probably this summer. C2 may never happen for either, and I'm fine with that. I'm only aiming for B1 comprehension in Thai. \n\nAs you get more skilled, you'll find you can do things in your TL that you normally do in your NL, and that compounds your enjoyable and/or useful exposure time. For example, I think it's important to stay informed, so I read the newspaper daily. I get my global news from German and Spanish sources, though I still read in my NL for local issues. Likewise,  if I have time to watch TV or movies, that's easily done i in my TLs. I can watch anything in Spanish as comfortably as I watch in English. German is a bit more challenging, but I understand enough to be entertained even if I miss some nuance and detail. Thai is my weakest one, but I comprehend enough for the action and horror movies most likely to be selected by my family (I can understand Lakorn decently, but... ughh... Lakorn). Though I almost exclusively participate in English on Reddit, the subs I *read* are largely Spanish and German. My book selections from the library are 50% NL (I teach literature and rhetoric in my NL, so I don't have the luxury of neglecting that, nor do I want to), 25% Spanish, and 25% German.

You should set a goal for your viewing time so you aren't relying on it being entertaining or not. \n\nWhen I'm at the beginning stages and I watch a show, I am usually playing a couple games with myself: *spot the word*, and *what just happened?* For the first, I'm really just looking for what few words I understand and trying to pick up often repeated words (this is how I learned the words \"murder\" in a crime show and \"patience\"/\"impatience\" in a kids' show very early on, for example: the visual context and repetition made those clear even though I understood little else). For the second, I'm making the story entertaining to me by filling in plot blanks as best I can based on context. When I watch again at a higher level, sometimes I'll find I was pretty close, and sometimes I'll find I was *way* off (I missed a major plot point in a novela way back when and only got to rewatch it when streaming became a thing... I'd been *way* off plot-wise, but it'd been my very first Spanish TV show, started the first day of my first college Spanish class, so that was to be expected. I also sometimes worked when the show was on, so poor language skills coupled with missed episodes were something of a mess. Streaming is a boon for language-learning! For the record, I think my totally-wrong plot was better.)\n\nUltimately, when I watch TV above my level, I'm getting used to the sounds and phrasing of the language at full speed. During this stage, I'm spending a greater amount of time with accessible material: graded readers and audiobooks, textbooks (with or without a teacher), CI videos when available, etc. I wouldn't expect to learn much beyond a sound sense from TV shows well beyond my level. If I do want to pick up more, I find a show I know well with dubs in my TL, but I will admit this isn't terribly exciting as there aren't a ton of shows I like to rewatch. I save some shows that I really enjoy for later viewing with some actual language skill (for example, I'm feeling just about ready to watch the rest of *Dark* in the original German with no subtitles of any kind. It was my first German show, and it was so interesting that I caved and put on the English subs so I could understand what was going on season 1; I decided the later seasons would be a treat when I got better at German). \n\nThe bulk of my listening practice comes from podcasts and audiobooks. They speak very clearly, which helps, and I can listen as I drive and walk, which makes them fit into my busy schedule. I also start these before I'm ready. I remember Easy German barely being comprehensible -- I'd be thrilled when I understood the *topic* of a segment. Now I listen to it every day with ease. I'm frequently introduced to new words, but I can't even remember the last time I was confused. I'm now able to follow some podcasts for native speakers (with some effort) as well. I don't think I'd have gotten to this stage if I'd thought, \"I'll wait to listen to Easy German until I can understand it.\" It was the process of listening to it, along with my other studies, that made listening to it possible. I mention this because it's very easy to give up on something that feels too challenging. Sometimes it really is and should be put off for later (like, in my case, *Dark*), but sometimes it should be suffered through. I think a healthy balance of mostly just-right materials (i+1) and a sprinkling of too-hard materials keeps things interesting and challenging.

I think it's very clear that we are supposed to follow Christ's example in *this* life, and so I focus on that instead and hope the rest follows.\n\nI've been told I'm not Christian by some people because I don't believe in an afterlife, and, well... that's okay.

I've had overwhelming mystic experiences, and I've had long, long seasons of spiritual dryness. I'm once again in the latter right now.

Help my unbelief!\" \n\nI don't have an answer for you, but I thought I'd just throw out there that you aren't alone. There are plenty of imperfect Christians out there considering *all* of us are imperfect. What we struggle with differs from person to person, whether it's with faith or acts such as compassion and forgiveness, but we've all got some struggle.

There are people (like my mom) who never falter in their faith, but there are also plenty of people like me who do. I'll leave you with this little Wikipedia tidbit from the Dark Night of the Soul entry with a pertinent detail in bold. Such examples of faithful people experiencing the same thing I do *and getting past it* give me hope: \n\n\"The term \"dark night (of the soul)\" in Roman Catholic spirituality describes a spiritual crisis in the journey toward union with God, like that described by St. John of the Cross.  \nSt. Th\u00e9r\u00e8se of the Child Jesus and the Holy Face, OCD, a 19th-century French nun and doctor of the Church, wrote of her own experience of the dark night. **Her dark night derived from doubt of the existence of eternity**, to which doubt she nonetheless did not give intellectual or volitional assent, but rather prevailed by a deepening of her Catholic faith. However, she painfully suffered through this prolonged period of spiritual darkness, even declaring to her fellow nuns: \"If you only knew what darkness I am plunged into\".\\[9\\]  \nWhile this spiritual crisis is usually temporary, it may endure for a long time. The \"dark night\" of St. Paul of the Cross in the 18th century endured 45 years, from which he ultimately recovered. The dark night of St. Teresa of Calcutta, whose own name in religion she selected in honor of St. Th\u00e9r\u00e8se, \"may be the most extensive such case on record\", having endured from 1948 almost until her death in 1997, with only brief interludes of relief, according to her letters.\\[10\\]\"", "created_utc": "1665331697.0", "edited": "False", "id": "irncpxr", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_xzkf5i", "parent_id": "t3_xzkf5i", "score": "11", "subreddit": "Episcopalian", "subreddit_id": "t5_2ukdr"}, {"author": "LeenaJones", "body": "There are some Discords that do volunteer-led lessons sometimes.

When I think of how little I learned in three years of high school language classes, it sounds depressing; when I recognize that at most those three years had 360 instructional hours, not even deducting interruptions for illnesses, substitutes, assemblies, field trips, learning loss during summer and winter breaks, my own lack of motivation with regards to homework and focusing on class assignments, and the teacher having to deal with disruptive students, it's actually impressive that I learned as much as I did.

In AP, it's a bit different as missing the homework has a more negative affect on being able to do the classwork, but it's still ultimately optional. If they chose AP, they did so knowing homework was expected; we make that very clear upon them signing up. If a student wants an A in AP or regular, they should try to do about half of the homework. Spread out over the week, the entire amount of homework takes 15-20 minutes a day (weekdays only, never over holidays). If they want a B, they needn't do any at all, though the homework I design *does* help them master the skills we're working on in class, and I always encourage it without pressure. I think that's reasonable. \n\nI *do* check in with students who don't do their homework, especially if they've told me they're aiming for an A. I can help with time management, limiting distractions, and refer them to the mental health services we have on campus as appropriate. Sometimes, I hear what's keeping them busy and just say, \"Yeah, I wouldn't do homework under those conditions either. Get some sleep.\" I was a student in \"those conditions\" way back when. I get it. \n\nIf your teachers take late work, I see no problem with your plan. If they don't, you might have to talk to them, but you can keep it vague. I tell my students that when they need an extension, I'm perfectly happy to hear *why* if they want to tell me, but that it's sufficient to say, \"Hey, Ms. Jones, life is happening right now. Could I turn all this stuff in next month?\" Depending on the assignment and the time of the year (I can't carry things over grading periods), the answer is usually yes. A few assignments that prep for classwork can't be made up (that happens in AP only), but most can. Practicing the skills I teach is *best* when done in short bursts consistently rather than cramming a bunch at once, but I can't control conditions outside my classroom, so that's just something I have to let go. \n\nMore likely than not, if your teachers feel anything at all about your lack of homework, it's *worry* (and it sounds like that's justified). Now, of course, different schools have different cultures, but when my colleagues and I talk about homework not being turned in from students who are generally on task during class, that's where our minds go. Even for those who tend to be disruptive or disengaged, we worry that they might be hiding a lack of skill through avoidance behavior, might have some personal issue needing to be addressed, might not have hope for their future, etc., but then it's the class behavior that starts that worry, not the lack of homework; in fact, it's quite shocking when a student who doesn't do classwork brings in homework. \n\nYou might want to tell your counselor and/or parents about your mental health concerns. There are likely resources available that can help you. You needn't deal with it alone; in fact, dealing with it alone before having learned effective coping strategies from a trained psychologist or therapist can often prolong the issue. I will add the caveat that I am not a mental health professional, but I've had a *lot* of therapy and am better for it. I also see great improvement among my students who accept the help we offer. \n\nI sincerely hope you feel better soon, whatever you choose to do.", "created_utc": "1664370936.0", "edited": "False", "id": "iq8ckk3", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_xq3y8y", "parent_id": "t3_xq3y8y", "score": "1", "subreddit": "Teachers", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qqcs"}, {"author": "LeenaJones", "body": "I'm that weirdo that loves when Monday comes around.

A polyglot in which languages? Are you going to choose languages based on their closeness to ones you already know to get your number higher or based on interest and usefulness? Are you going to set the bar of \"fluency\" at A1? Are you going to use the languages for anything other than party tricks?\n\nLanguage learning is the hobby a lot of us on here share. It's an action. Being a polyglot is a state of being; it's static; it's one of the potential end results of the former. Saying I want to be a polyglot would be like if I decided I wanted to learn to play bridge and walked into the local bridge club saying, \"I want to be a bridge champion\" to introduce myself. Sure, some people there might share that goal; some people just want to play bridge with friends and maybe go compete now and then; some are satisfied to play at the club only. Regardless, everyone's probably going to think that's an odd statement coming from someone who doesn't even know how to bid.\n\nUltimately, the word \"polyglot\" doesn't communicate much information to fellow language-learning enthusiasts. Compare these two accurate ways I might describe myself in a profile. The first would likely encourage interactions with people I'd actually want to talk with while limiting interactions with people with wildly different language goals and interests. The second would lead to being ignored or repeatedly being asked the same thing (What are you learning? How many languages are you aiming for? etc.). \n\n\n1.  I'm reviewing Spanish (B2) and learning German (B1) with the goal of being able to converse comfortably and read literature in both. On the side, I'm working on my receptive Thai and will move that to the forefront once I can read Goethe, but my goals in Thai only involve comprehension and very basic production. When I retire, I plan to add Romanian and get it to the level of my (hopefully advanced by then) Spanish and German. Since this is a hobby and not a necessity for my career or any kind of relocation, what matters to me is that I enjoy the process. For me, that means little to no drill and kill (sorry, Anki). I also enjoy dabbling in languages where I get an idea of how a language works without being concerned with really learning to *use* the language. These linguistic dalliances usually last just a few months. \n\n\n 2.

Whenever I'm offered some extra work at my \"hourly\" rate, I get *which* of the hourly rates in writing in an email that includes payroll, the principal, and the head secretary (who submits our extra hours to payroll). I can't even count how many times an error has been made and that email has come in handy. And, yes, I do point out when the error is in my favor as well. I got screwed over once my third year teaching because I didn't get the offer in writing. It turns out the person who made the offer misspoke, and I was getting the right rate per district policy, but it was not a rate I would have agreed to.

This will not be the last time you have students like this in your class. \n\nYou do need to call home, and you do need to talk to the dean. Tell the dean your struggles and ask for support and advice. I have a few this year that I'm concerned about, so the dean came to watch that class so she'd get an idea of what's going on, how I respond, etc. (The dean this year is new to our school and doesn't know me or my teaching style yet). I'm not ready to send anyone out yet, and it's very possible I'll never have to, but I like to be prepared. A dean can't respond very effectively when they have no context but a scrawled pass, rushed ranty email, and whatever story the student spins in their office. After the observation, the dean had positive things to say about what she observed and shared plans to build a positive relationship with the students in question so if things *do* get bad, she's not just some random stranger doling out consequences. \n\nI also made sure to contact parents/guardians in a non-confrontational way (\"I've noticed Bob seems to be having trouble starting/staying focused on assignments. I wonder if you could share ways teachers have supported him in the past that were successful.\" This kind of starter usually elicits helpful responses rather than the understandably defensive responses some have when faced with a list of their child's misbehavior). \n\nHave you talked with students individually yet? This can solve a lot of problems. I have students set goals each quarter and frame such one-on-one's in relation to the goals they set. Here's how it often plays out:\n\n\"I read that you wanted to earn a B this quarter, and I see right now you have a D. Can you think of things you could be doing differently to get that B and ways I can support you?\" Students know what's up. They'll usually sheepishly say, \"I need to put my phone away\" or \"I need to actually do my work.\" Then I say, \"Okay, so to help you do that, how about I make eye contact and X gesture when you need to put your phone away and I check in with you once the class is supposed to be doing individual or group work and help you get started?\" If they agree, well, now the student has *opted in* to the very redirections I want to do anyway, and they know it's from a place of support and not antagonism. Even when the undersireable behaviors continue (and they probably will for a bit; old habits die hard), the *relationship* is better, subtle redirections are not taken as some kind of power struggle, and the edge of disrespectful behavior becomes less sharp. Sometimes it takes a couple weeks for real noticeable improvement; sometimes it's months. Meanwhile, your job is to be relentlessly supportive while consistently making your expectations clear and holding students to them. \n\nThere will be students who resist this conversation. In those cases, no matter how rude they get, I say, \"Okay. Well, I wanted you to know I'm going to be here to help you when you decide you want help. I'll check in with you again in a week.\" I email the counselor about the exchange and ask them to do a check-in as well. I had a student who stubbornly hated me and my check-ins and relentless offers of support for four months until, finally, he just decided one day that he was going to do some work. I found something to compliment in that work. I got more work the next day. By the end of the month, he was one of my top students in that class, both in behavior and academics. Now, I'm not going to say that *I* made that happen; I knew what was going on at home, and I suspect the student needed time to get his anger and grief out and only when he had finally started emotionally healing was able to even think about learning, but I *do* think my never giving up on him helped him feel safe when it came to deciding to change when he was ready. He didn't do that in all of his classes. \n\nThe first time I tried this approach, I wasn't sure it would pay off. Fifteen-some years later, and it's not even a source of stress. I know if I do my part, the student will come around eventually. It's failed *maybe* twice. \n\nMeanwhile, pick your colleagues' brains about classroom management strategies. Observe some good and bad teaching styles. Record yourself teaching and review your reactions to various undesirable behaviors and honestly evaluate those responses (I *still* do this decades into teaching, and I always find something I can improve). Consider having other teachers/the dean/admin observe you to provide you with management feedback. As a second-year teacher, you've probably got plenty of room to grow in this area. There's a myth that this just comes with time, but there are veteran teachers out there with absolutely terrible classroom management. It comes with research, reflection, and *effort*.

Pay attention to good and bad lesson design, behavior management, etc. Learn the standards. Learn about backwards planning, unit design, and lesson design. Read books on teaching, particularly about literacy instruction in the content areas, ELL supports, rubric design, and grading philosophies. Join your professional association as a college student. Attend some conferences if you can swing it. There are often scholarships available. \n\nI started observing classes in my subject area in the local schools my very first semester of college. My former teachers helped me make contact with others in the district so I wouldn't just see more of the honors and AP classes I'd experienced (though I did spend time in those as well). These teachers generously opened their doors to me and even shared how they came up with certain lessons to teach a particular skill, how they were assessing the students, etc. It was a wonderful way to start looking at a classroom from a new perspective, and when I finally got into my major courses and the teacher college, it helped me make the best of both. \n\nAlso, because of my later work as a tutor and the relationships I'd made in all that classroom time, I knew exactly which school I wanted a job at, and everyone there talked me up to those in charge of hiring. I, and several friends who had done the same as me, went into student teaching knowing I had a job waiting for me at my dream school. When I first decided I wanted to be a teacher, I'd thought I wanted to teach students who excelled and loved reading and writing; turns out that my true passion lies in helping the most struggling students -- the ones teachers on this sub often describe leaving the profession over. When I became a teacher, there had been a mass retirement in all the local districts *and* a swell in the student population that was just reaching high school: I had my pick of districts and schools (and it wasn't because of the things that are causing the shortage today at all). Because of all my time in various schools and classes, I knew exactly where I wanted to be and have never had to wonder if I was missing out on something. \n\nNow... no school is perfect, and mine definitely isn't by any metric. There are policies that frustrate, administration that doesn't support (we outlast admin, so we get cycles of good, bad, amazing, okay, etc. over a career), and -- who saw this coming? -- crazy things like global pandemics pushing us onto Zoom when our students don't have internet access at home.

I have, unfortunately, seen more student teachers fail or drop out than pass (having worked in so many classrooms, I saw quite a lot; I've also had several of my own). It amazes me how many express that they didn't know teaching was *hard*. I remember the first one I observed telling me she was going to finish student teaching, but she'd realized she hated teenagers, hated how much effort it was, and had started studying for the LSAT at night so she could become a lawyer instead. She asked me not to tell her master teacher.

A friend of mine who is a much more dedicated language learner than I am sounds native in several languages and can switch between them effortlessly. He's also an excellent musician, and I think that has aided both his listening and pronunciation ability, but mostly, he spends a ton of his day perfecting his languages. He even masters slang. It's really impressive stuff. \n\nI, on the other hand, like to rush through basics to get to the material that interests me, am much more interested in listening and reading than sounding anywhere near like a native (I am careful to learn correct pronunciation, of course, but I don't spend much time on accent reduction), and I tap out at about 90 minutes of language study a day (though I will do non-study things like reading and watching TV in my TLs in addition to that). I am a mediocre musician, and I do think that helps a bit, especially as I grew up singing in quite a few different languages, and part of that included making some sounds not present in my NL. I'm not going to say I *mastered* those sounds, but at least when I started learning languages, I wasn't overwhelmed by the fact that there were sounds I had trouble distinguishing or producing at first (like \u0e14 and \u0e15 in Thai, for example); I knew it would be possible to pick up in time. I'm still not doing the German R quite right, but no one's had trouble understanding me thus far, so I'm willing to keep listening and believing it'll come in time, just like I woke up one day a couple years into Spanish and was suddenly able to roll my Rs. But if it doesn't happen... eh, what harm is there? \n\nAnd what I've described is, I think, why many of us adults do not reach the level of fluency we might fantasize about: 1. We don't have enough time to dedicate to the language (or are unwilling to make the time... I mean, I could be studying instead of writing this post on Reddit, right?). 2. We're impatient and rush. 3. We're okay with *good enough*. \n\nI don't think the latter is necessarily a problem, personally, as perfectionism can *also* impede learning, but it certainly isn't going to lead to native-like fluency. Hell, I've got over 20 years of Spanish under my belt, and while I get by just fine for my needs, I wouldn't pass the speaking portion of a C2 exam, and no one in their right mind upon hearing me speak would think I've had *that* much experience (even though, on my end, speaking my imperfect Spanish is quite effortless). My spoken Spanish is kind of like my adult-immigrant in-laws' spoken English: accented with some fossilized errors that don't impede communication. My in-laws have been here speaking English over 40 years, have earned advanced degrees in American universities in many cases, but are conversationally happy with \"good enough.* So am I. That's not a biological impediment. That's an issue of priorities; being perfect or near-perfect in a language simply isn't one of mine. \n\nRegarding the mental fogginess described by those two language learners you mentioned, I can't say I get that. Even in my newest language, German, I don't feel that. I definitely run into words I don't know (frequently!) or try to say something only to realize the grammatical structure I need just isn't accessible in my brain yet (also frequent!), but that's more like slamming into a wall than any kind of fogginess. When I'm plugging along in topics I'm comfortable in with fairly straightforward syntax, I can't say I feel any particular fogginess or distance (I liked that latex gloves vs. bare hands analogy, but I definitely do not feel it and don't think I have in any language I've studied).

I'd suggest arranging some observational visits at local high schools. My district makes this difficult for people who aren't yet in a teaching program, which is unfortunate since I can't count how many people start observing (or, worse, student teaching) and then decide teaching is not for them. And, to be clear, my classes are generally well-behaved and fun, so it's not the studenrs scaring these people away; it's the sheer amount of work. For example, the observer comes in and sees a fun lesson with all the students engaged. \"Wow, teaching looks great!\" they say. I show them how I arrived at the lesson: first backwards planning the unit, then designing individual lessons to build up to the skills they need for the culminating activity, all tied to state standards, then adjusting those lessons based on feedback from formative assessments, then adjusting yet more for individual students at various stages of learning English and with IEPs requiring specific support. I show them the mini-lessons I had to teach to get students to the point where they could work effectively in a group and do the skills required of them for the lesson they observed. I show them the notes I took during the activity of students' strengths and weaknesses which will lead to the next lesson\n\nFor me, all of that is actually really enjoyable: some people paint; I design masterful lessons. But there are some aspiring teachers who think of lessons as just an unconnected series of hopefully entertaining activities with no demonstrable purpose.

That generally leads to a weekly behavior tracker monitored by the counselor or admin with a weekly call home from *them* regarding improvement and next steps. The teaching team all agree to enforce the desired behavior in all classes with positive reinforcement and appropriate reminders (gentle, if possible). \n\nI had to go this route with a student last year. She was the most out-of-control student ever with attention-seeking behaviors and bullying behaviors aimed at teachers and peers. In our meeting, we learned that her tragic backstory totally explained those attention-seeking, aggressive behaviors. So we set to work. She was ignored when she used undesired behaviors (but for us putting it on the weekly report) and praised when she contributed appropriately. It didn't take long for her to see she could only get the attention she sought through playing by our rules. She started staying in her seat, using appropriate language, raising her hand, being on topic. It took about a month for the full transition. Meanwhile, the team sent a mass email every time she did something good, and we'd greet her with, \"Hey, I heard you were the first to solve that hard problem in Mr. X's class!\" or whatever. \n\nIn the process, she discovered she liked learning and was very capable of it when she actually tried. Even when we released her from the contract, she kept improving. At the beginning of the year, her career goal had been to be a social media influencer. By the end, she'd decided she wanted to be a lawyer, and she's putting in the work to make that happen. This was Hallmark movie levels of transformation, but it took time and a dedicated team; a detention or a series of detentions wouldn't have facilitated that.", "created_utc": "1662729494.0", "edited": "False", "id": "inq1quq", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_x9p9r1", "parent_id": "t3_x9p9r1", "score": "3", "subreddit": "Teachers", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qqcs"}, {"author": "LeenaJones", "body": "That is the correct response.", "created_utc": "1662726616.0", "edited": "False", "id": "inpvrnl", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_x9pond", "parent_id": "t3_x9pond", "score": "11", "subreddit": "Teachers", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qqcs"}, {"author": "LeenaJones", "body": "I used Polylogger over the summer.", "created_utc": "1662725481.0", "edited": "False", "id": "inptl8z", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_x9rv19", "parent_id": "t3_x9rv19", "score": "5", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "LeenaJones", "body": "My husband insists some languages sound nicer than others, but I find all languages sound equally pleasant to me, whether I know them to any degree or not.

I often start one project on my prep only to get an idea for another, start on that, then get an idea... well, you know the drill. The checklist keeps me on top of things. They are my must-dos, and if I don't get them done, then I have to stay until they are done. No exceptions. That's pretty good motivation to get back on track. \n\nI write down absolutely everything because my related audio processing disorder makes my ability to create memories unreliable. So... if I tell a student he can turn something in late, I write that down on the roster or as a comment on the assignment in our LMS. I tell the students that if they don't see me write an exception down, it didn't happen. If there's an IEP scheduled, I fill out the report immediately and, if I'm attending, put the date in my calendar (checking my calendar in the morning and adding what's on it to my to-do list is task #1 every day). The same is true of any task like that; it gets done immediately. I am obsessively consistent with this. \n\nI set alarms 2 minutes before class starts and 2 minutes before class ends. I set an alarm for meetings. I set an alarm for my daily walks. I set an alarm for when it's time to start winding down for bed. That might sound like overkill, but I will forget to exercise if I'm in the middle of a project, and I *will stay up all night* if I let my hyperfocus get triggered before bed. \n\nI have a very detailed syllabus, and I create a pacing guide for the entire year during the previous semester. This keeps me from adding in random novels and projects and totally overwhwlming students by assigning three unrelated things at once. I can still change things during the year, but it's a one-in, one-out system. I can't *add* an essay without *removing* one, for example. \n\nI tidy up my classroom every Friday before I leave. The alternative is papers *everywhere*. \n\nI check work emails at work during my duty day only.\n\nI think my ADHD actually makes me very productive and creative; I just needed to create the boundaries and reminders necessary to get things streamlined.

That's actually my favorite thing to do once I'm competent enough for it to be possible. For example, I needed to refresh my algebra skills several years back, so I took a MOOC taught in Spanish.  \n\nWhat I'd *really* like to find is the Spanish and/or German equivalent of The Great Courses if such a thing exists. I'd love to learn about history or literature or opera while driving and also getting some practice in in my TL. Some podcasts scratch that itch, but they usually aren't quite so in depth as The Great Courses. \n\nWhat your level needs to be depends on what you're trying to learn. I took some Youtube yoga classes in German before I was even A2 because I had the visual support to help me if I got lost. I learned some body parts but mostly, \"Breathe in, breathe out\" and had no problems. I was B2 when I took that algebra class I mentioned, and that felt right. I didn't struggle with the language at all. \n\nI think it's normal that you're having trouble understanding new concepts and skills when struggling with the language. Your attention is split between learning the subject and learning the words. This is a really common challenge among my students who are still learning English while simultaneously enrolled in my literature or rhetoric classes. Among other supports, I might provide them with background information and a summary of what we're about to read in their native language before we start reading. \n\nI do the same for myself when I'm in that situation. For example, I like a podcast called Tatort Geschichte, but it often delves into historical periods or geographical locations that I'm not terribly familiar with. When it does, I'll pause and look those up in English and then be better able to understand the context of the event for that episode. It takes one thinking task off my plate while I listen and allows me to better learn. \n\nThe trick is to find something that's right for your language level OR something you have a lot of background knowledge in. When I took that algebra class, it had been a good decade since my last math class, but it's not like I'd totally forgotten everything, so I had the luxury of the concepts *and* the language not overwhelming me at the same time. If I jumped into a physics class in Spanish, I assume it wouldn't go so well. My knowledge of physics is limited to a couple Brian Greene books; I've never taken a class, so both the concepts *and* the vocabulary would be new.

Now you have things like Dreaming Spanish designed specifically for learners, but the same traits are there: slower speech, lots of context, clear enunciation, lots of repetition. You will probably find you understand a lot more when the input is appropriate for your level. \n\nI'm a big fan of Easy German's podcast. If Easy Spanish is similar quality, I recommend it. If it's too overwhelming, I'd say do some Dreaming Spanish for a bit and then go back to it. \n\nIf you're having trouble forming sentences, you might benefit from the kind of practice Pimsleur audio courses provide (also frequently available at libraries). The first level or two will probably seem too easy (I'd still recommend them for the foundation they build, but you could probably speed through doing two lessons a day), but levels three through five really hammer in the complex sentence patterns. \n\nThough you've had four years of Spanish, we don't know how much time you spent on it each day or what kind of practice you had in class.

I'd already learned them in my language arts classes (heck, we even learned the English subjunctive in elementary school, and I've heard *teachers* say English doesn't have a subjunctive!). A couple districts over, students did *not* learn these things at the time because those districts favored a different methodology. \n\nThe district I grew up in and now teach in has moved away from grammar terminology instruction in elementary and middle school, and it is harder to help students revise in high school as we do not already share a vocabulary for what needs to be fixed. If the issue is tense, I can't just say, \"Oh, you need past perfect here\" and expect the student to understand both what that is and why they need it like I used to. That doesn't mean they can't revise, but I find myself either having to talk around the terms or having to explain them, and it takes a bit longer. Not everyone is annoyed by this, mind you; some of my colleagues who are *excellent* teachers wouldn't be able to tell you the difference between a restrictive and nonrestrictive clause. \n\nDo the vast majority of students who won't be majoring in the langusge arts or linguistics need those terms? Probably not, but it sure does help during instruction. I've gone some 30 years since learning the quadratic formula without having to use it outside of a class once, yet I'm not about to go around saying math classes should stop teaching it: it is fundamental, and had I majored in something other than the humanities, I would have needed it *or the kind of thinking necessary to understand it* to be successful. If nothing else, learning it taught me to respect the people who figured out formulas for the many things we do that seem magical but are in fact mathematical (flying a plane comes to mind). It also taught me to pay attention to detail (something I often skip on Reddit posts, alas). \n\nSome people think learning the terminology is difficult and unnecessary; others find it helps to be able to talk about sentence construction and parts. I liken learning a language without learning the terminology to learning to fix an engine without knowing what the parts are called. Possible? Absolutely. But I'd *personally* feel silly calling everything \"that thingy\" or making up names when names already exist. I think I read it was Michel Thomas who consistently calls the accusative the \"victim\" of the verb in his German lessons to avoid any hint of direct grammar instruction. Dude... just call it the accusative. It's not that hard. \n\nSince I learned these terms relatively young and then studied linguistics in college, adding yet more terminology, I haven't ever been overwhelmed by language *terminology* when learning a language. For me, it's been helpful. I can immediately look up what I need, recognize differences between my target and native languages, and recognize and talk about patterns when listening and reading. I can't know how or if it is overwhelming to people learning it for the first time not even knowing how to apply the terms to their own language. \n\nAs someone who loves grammar, I don't get the appeal of all those language programs that advertise, \"Learn French without studying grammar!\" and such. What they mean by \"studying grammar\" is using the terminology. *All* language learning involves studying grammar; it's just that there are two ways to go about it: the so-called traditional way that introduces students to the rules and terms in a structured way and the supposedly no-grammar way that exposes the student to repeated constructions (grammar!), generally through comprehensible input,  until the student has internalized them. \n\nI think both are useful. I tend to think relying solely on the latter will take longer as learners don't even know what they're looking for. But longer isn't necessarily bad so long as the person isn't in a hurry. Focusing solely on the former will result in people who speak robotically, if they speak at all. In my opinion, it really needs to be a mix. The person who posted recently about their FSI experience noted they spent 5-10% of their time on overt grammar study. As a grammar afficionado, I'd probably up that to 20% personally, but I certainly agree it shouldn't be the bulk of one's time in the language. \n\nI love starting a language with Pimsleur which does a balance of introducing syntax methodically while making it feel absolutely natural and stress-free. I also love piling on the reading and listening, from appropriately leveled sources when available. I find it much easier to understand a grammar concept *after* I've been exposed to it several times. At the same time, I *really* want to know why, for example, certain changes to articles and the ends of words are happening (*Herrn* threw me for a loop in German in the first couple weeks!), and I can only be so patient before I need to know the nitty gritty of what's going on. \n\nThis reminds me a bit of some differing styles of tap dance. Some teachers count everything and use the names of the steps (which vary by region, granted) as they teach a routine. Others just say \"buh DUM buh da dip\" and expect you to internalize that rhythm and copy their feet. Both work fine, but I *prefer* the former. One benefit of the former is if someone drops out of a dance and the choreographer needs a replacement real quick, I can learn the dance over the phone with just the counts and the names of the steps. These days videos make that unnecessary, but back when it would take about a year to upload a 5-second video, it was a good skill to have! Maybe the parallel to language production now would be the ubiquity of grammar checkers. \n\nThis has been a fun morning ramble.

I've had some who would be mistaken for native speakers if they didn't keep using the wrong prepositions and overgeneralizing past tense rules, and I've had students who could write beautiful and grammatically correct essays but were absolutely unintelligible when they tried to speak (one student in particular from Vietnam was seriously one of the best writers I'd ever taught, but his teachers in Vietnam had *only* taught English reading and writing, so he had trouble both understanding and pronouncing words. Oral communication was very challenging for quite some time). Those are extremes, though. More commonly, I have students with a mix of needs in both areas. \n\nAccents, as opposed to actual pronunciation errors, aren't generally a problem. Even a thick accent can be gotten used to pretty quickly. My college algebra teacher had the thickest Indian accent I've ever heard, and I actually credit that with why I did so well in his class -- I *had* to constantly focus or I wouldn't understand what he said. I know some classmates had a harder time with his accent, but he was a phenomenal math teacher, and we were all successful. English speakers tend to be pretty used to hearing a variety of accents as so many people from so many places learn English (plus, there are a variety of native accents in the English speaking world as well). \n\nGrammar errors outside of academic or professional contexts are rarely an issue, either. We don't need the conjugations to be right to get the meaning of the message (I have some in-laws who I swear have never conjugated a verb beyond 3rd person present; I understand them just fine), and while the wrong construction might feel off, I can only think of a couple times where grammar errors led to a real misunderstanding. \n\nIt *can* take effort to understand strong deficiencies in grammar and pronunciation, so it's worth improving both to make things easier on whomever you're speaking with, but most of us are going to understand you just fine when there's sufficient context.

When you listen to German, do you think about what it means in Italian? Do you ever write in German -- not for the purpose of being correct, but just to let your ideas flow onto the page as they come? What does your speaking practice consist of? Do you think in German to yourself throughout the day? Do you listen to German (podcasts, TV, Youtube...), and, if so, do you translate into Italian as you go? If you do translate during any of those activities, can you turn that off by reading aloud, listening to audio sources below your level (I realize this sounds counterintuitive, but if it's easy, you won't have to translate, and if you gradually increase the level of challenge, you can get used to not translating), turning off subtitles, summarizing what you just read/heard/watched immediately *in German*?\n\nI can also read *way* above my actual level in German, and my speaking trails behind, but when I speak and write in German, I think only in German. If I'm lacking vocabulary while writing, I might throw in an English word and look it up when I revise. If I'm lacking a word while speaking, I talk in circles around it, describing, gesturing, etc., until my interlocutor provides a word (either a paid tutor or a member of my German club; I wouldn't torture random people that way). \n\nAll languages are easier to understand than produce, but German (and languages like it) is especially so in the early stages because of how gender and case, tricky to many of us learners, are necessary in even the simplest sentences.

Maybe you can describe how you study and what resources you use, and then people can possibly point out holes in your strategy.

I am *not* a fan of Lakorns, so this was drudgery, but it was my only real option. I did watch a bunch of movies, but the comedies were wordplay that went right over my head, and the horror and action movies didn't have much dialogue (though I can still angrily say, \"Where is my elephant?\" with perfect tones and pronunciaction. Thank you, Tony Jaa). \n\nNow there's quite a lot more available, including a few podcasts I'm really interested in being able to listen to. I need to get my comprehension up to functional again in the next two years (I'm not even going to start until next year; I have other language priorities for now), and I think it will be a much more pleasant experience. I'm also not going to bother learning to speak. My main need for the language is that I'm often in the middle of Tinglish conversations; I can reply in English and be understood just fine, but I often lose the thread of conversations when the most important bits are said in Thai.", "created_utc": "1660575335.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ike1axm", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_wp09wn", "parent_id": "t3_wp09wn", "score": "3", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "LeenaJones", "body": "Even if you're intermediate, movies can be a challenge.

I still listen to more difficult content, but I find when I learn a word from a source for adult native speakers like *Tatort Geschichte*, I am less likely to have learned the article along with the word than when I learn a word through Nat\u00fcrlich German, a graded reader, or a book for middle-grade readers (like *Momo* or *Harry Potter*). \n\nIt's worked wonders. I'm not perfect by any stretch, but I now have an intuitive sense of the gender and declension much of the time.

I've retained best what I've learned from chunks of sentences. For example, I know *Museum* is neuter because I've been exposed to *so* many sentences talking about going to the museum, the exhibit in the museum, how to get to the museum, what someone thought about the museum, etc. I never had to try to memorize it.

That takes a few seconds a day and helps me balance my studying so I don't neglect, say, reading or speaking when I'm on a grammar or comprehensible input kick. \n\nThe only numbers I *truly* care about when learning is the hours of study I get in each day. \n\nAs far as whether or not counting words is good or bad... I don't think it really matters. To me, it sounds tedious. I wouldn't want to add some sort of tracking to my study time. To others, I imagine it would be motivating as it's concrete evidence of improvement (understanding more and talking and writing with more ease are plenty of evidence for me). The only bad I see coming out of it is when people think that since 5,000 words makes up 98% of regular communication, then they'll be fluent when they hit 5,000 words or be able to converse in 98% of conversations. I'm not knocking those 5,000 words -- they're undoubtedly essential -- but those quizzes I mentioned above put me at 5,000-8,000 words in German, and it's not enough to do more than function and have some shallow conversations. There's nothing wrong with that if that's a person's goal, but I find the less frequent words are essential for any in-depth discussions or truly interesting reading, so, for me, 5,000 is just a step on the way. Also, if all I focused on was learning words expecting to magically be able to put them together meaningfully once I got to 5,000, I would be sorely disappointed. We don't get many people on here obsessed with just studying vocabulary to hit a word count target, but we do get some, and they almost always cite one of these statistics about how knowing X amount will lead to Y% comprehension, and I think if that's their only focus, they'll be disappointed. But, as I said, that doesn't represent the bulk of the posts we get here by any stretch. \n\nThat video, at least how you described it, sounds clickbaity as hell. I try not to support such tactics.

My most recent was to have a solid B1 in German by the end of summer break (I had a weak B1 at the start). To see if I'm improving towards that goal, I've taken note of a number of things: I took a test yesterday that revealed three B1 skills I should know that I'm still weak in (one of them I swear I was never introduced to!), so now during my study sessions over the next two weeks, I know exactly what I need to focus on. I've gone from barely being able to join conversations in groups to being able to jump in, if not eloquently, at least effectively. I've gotten much better at the grammatical things that were a struggle at the beginning of the summer. I can read more challenging texts, listen to podcasts for native speakers (I was limited to Easy German before), and can generally ignore TL subtitles when watching TV (but not totally, partly because I have trouble making out words in *any* language when there's background noise and music). \n\nA secondary goal was to brush up my rusty Spanish, something I've done with about 30 minutes of Spanish a day (though not much speaking; that part's coming up in a couple weeks).\n\nMy next somewhat arbitrary goal is to reach B2 in German by the end of the year. That may or may not happen, but the goal I *can* control is getting in a minimum of 90 minutes of practice a day.

Maybe smaller goals like, \"I'll get 6 hours of reading in this week,\" or, \"I'll be comfortable with attributive adjective endings by next Friday\" would be better since those are much more actionable than, for example, my vague B2 by the end of the year goal. I set milestone goals like that because actually being fluent or reading Goethe with ease is so far off still that it's not really helpful when ot comes to checking my progress since the obvious result would be, \"Not there yet\" each time I checked. B2 is something I can test, and if I don't make it, I'll be able to find specific holes in my learning and use those to design my study sessions, like I did for B1.\n\nWhat I really I focus on is my 90 minutes a day, and I use Polylogger to ensure I'm getting my desired balance of listening, reading, speaking, grammar, and writing practice.", "created_utc": "1659865459.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ijakdch", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_wi7jrd", "parent_id": "t3_wi7jrd", "score": "3", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "LeenaJones", "body": "Reading helps the most for me, followed by writing.", "created_utc": "1659863583.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ijai5ul", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_wi7pg3", "parent_id": "t3_wi7pg3", "score": "2", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "LeenaJones", "body": "Search \"ADHD\" in the r/languagelearning sub for some pretty good tips specifically for people with ADHD.", "created_utc": "1659863369.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ijahwwo", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_wi8hci", "parent_id": "t3_wi8hci", "score": "2", "subreddit": "Spanish", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qtt1"}, {"author": "LeenaJones", "body": "The New Yorker, The Atlantic, and The New York Times (in the Opinion and Weekender sections) probably have the most easily accessible quality writing out there since each allows about five free articles a month online and each is available to check out electronically from *some* libraries (though possibly not yours, granted).\n\nAs far as your specific topics of interest, there's no guarantee that they will be covered at any given time.

As free resources go, that's really not bad. \n\nThe bad comes with the ads taking up nearly as much time as the lessons, the mistakes in the lessons, the lack of any real instruction or explanation, and the less-than-perfect phrasing and less-than-human voices (better than they were, but still bad in my opinion). There's also a lack of extended texts. The stories are a good start, but they never get terribly complex (and what somewhat complex ones were there are now gone). \n\nThe worst thing it does, I think, is suck up time that could be better used. What you described is what Duolingo is best at: getting people with not much time or energy started. I use it during down time or when I want to review some vocab for a specific topic (like, I wanted to talk to my tutor ablut a book I was reading, but I couldn't remember the words for \"plot\" or \"character\" and such, so I did the \"Literature\" section rather than searching up the words. That worked fine. But if I'd only used Duolingo as a study method, I don't think I would have learned enough by now to be able to *read* the book I'm reading or watch the shows I'm watching. \n\nAs a review tool, it's convenient because it's basically premade flashcards. The tradeoff for that convenience is it's hard to find what lesson to study for a specific skill. For example, attributive adjective endings in German get introduced under a lesson called \"moving\" or something like that. If all the lessons were topical, then fine, but there are also lessons just called, \"Grammar 1\" and \"Grammar 2,\" etc., with no clue as to what grammatical topic will be covered. \n\nMy personal compromise is that I *play* Duolingo during downtime or when I want to do a specific review but am feeling lazy, but I don't count it as part of my minimum 90 minutes of study a day. Duolingo is accessible and easy, and I think there's a good chunk of evidence in this sub alone of people dipping their toes into languages with it before becoming serious about study, and that's a good thing.

Nat\u00fcrlich German on Youtube and Easy German podcast are great for building up your listening skills. Since the podcast has two hosts (plus occasional guests), that might be better for listening to how people converse.  TV shows can help as well, but remember that the everyday pleasantries are often skipped for time and dramatic purposes, whereas Easy German *always* starts with them.

That could be as simple as reading an article and then speaking your opinion about what you just read, doing something like Pimsleur that puts you in contexts and prompts you to respond aloud, doing the lessons on Nicos Weg (on the DW Learn German app) which has exercises and prompts for self study, including prompts for speaking practice. Andr\u00e9 Klein has an amusing book of easy conversations that I checked out a while back; it'd be worth reading aloud (and reading aloud is a good strategy overall, of course).
