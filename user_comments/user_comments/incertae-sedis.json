I've had some periods of abstinence of around 100 days, but recently I've faltered. You don't have to read any further if you're not interested in that perspective, I would understand that completely.\n\nI'm against pornography because pornography normalises abnormal and sometimes harmful sexual behaviour for financial gain. Most of the time, this is behaviour that is harmful to women. It teaches girls that they should enjoy being degraded, and it teaches boys that aggression towards women is sexy. It imprints the message in young boys and girls that women enjoy being hurt, that aggressive sex is the norm and that this is something that is normal to \\*expect\\* from women, unless they want to be seen as prudes or \\*gasp\\* blue haired feminists.\n\nI am not against consenting adults making informed decisions based on mutual respect about what they want to do with their own bodies. It's none of my business and I'm not interested in judging or policing what people decide to do together if they are truly on equal footing. But this is too often not the reality on the ground. The reality is more like a prolonged male on female siege. Like a war. Pornsick men breaking down the defenses and dismantling the self respect and common sense of women just so they get to live out their violent fantasies in the bedroom. Constant gaslighting, deflection, denial and making false equivalences when anyone tries to actually address this issue. **This is what I'm against and his is why I am against porn.**\n\nThis is my primary reason for being against porn, but there is more. I believe porn erodes trust in relationships. I believe porn makes men depressed. I believe many, if not most, of the people working in porn are being exploited. I believe that my own sexual preferences have been damaged and warped by porn. I believe that making porn easily accessible to chidren (as it was made to me when I was a child) is a mild form of grooming and child abuse. I believe that pornography and rape culture go hand in hand. I believe that a culture in which these ideas are seen as radical and unreasonable is sick.\n\nIf it was not for porn, I may still have been blind to the fact that the patriarchy is not a myth.

More specifically, who owns the means of production. If a person owns a factory and buys people's labour so he can make a profit, that's capitalism. The workers don't own the materials they work with, don't get a say in how the business is run, and can't sell what they made. The business is profitable because the workers sell their labour for less than it's actually worth.\n\nAs far as I understand it, anarcho-capitalism didn't evolve out of any earlier anarchist tradition, and is pretty much anarchism in name only. I've seen a lot of anarchists point out that capitalism needs authority (including the authority of the state) to uphold it. Every time the police attacks crowds of striking workers, every time unions are banned, this is authority protecting capitalism.\n\nFrom wikipedia:\n\n>\"**Capitalism** is an economic system based on the private ownership of the means of production and their operation for profit.\"\n\nFrom your post:\n\n>I believe workers should in control of the workplace and be treated  fairly and by that I mean being paid what your worth not what I can get  away with a top down system in my opinion is autocratic, if there needs  to be a boss, say a large warehouse, it should be done through  consensus, this creates checks and balances instead of just dealing with  a shit boss.\n\nYou don't sound like a capitalist to me, but I'd just do some more reading if I were you. Also, take everything I said with a grain of salt. Like I said, I'm pretty new to all of this myself.\n\nEdit: corrected grammar", "created_utc": "1618570008.0", "edited": "1618574431.0", "id": "gupkbob", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_mrzyte", "parent_id": "t3_mrzyte", "score": "2", "subreddit": "Anarchy101", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s960"}, {"author": "incertae-sedis", "body": "I will not drink with you today!", "created_utc": "1618482987.0", "edited": "False", "id": "gul9i6c", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_mr9791", "parent_id": "t3_mr9791", "score": "8", "subreddit": "stopdrinking", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s7yr"}, {"author": "incertae-sedis", "body": "That thing you described doing could be me.
