When I first started out, I was using a textbook, Duolingo, Babbel, and an iTalki tutor, although after getting the basics down I switched to a more immersion/comprehensible input based approach. There have been months recently where I didn't use Swedish much due to school/work taking up a lot of my time, but I have found that consistency matters a lot more than putting in a ton of hours in a short period of time.

I'm in the third-semester French class right now and would place myself around an A2 at best. I used to practice French outside of class but gave that up a while ago when I realized that I just enjoy Swedish a lot more. From this experience, I've learned that American universities go quite slow when teaching languages, and you probably won't become fluent in one if all you do is attend classes. Unfortunately, I'm probably going to give up on French after this semester, just because I will no longer need to take any language classes for my degree and I'd rather spend my extra time on Swedish rather than reviewing French or trying to progress further in it.\n\nI think this thread is a good idea, but I'd say that it's also important for beginners to not focus so much on the time aspect in the first place.

The downfall is that a decent amount of class time can get eaten up by other students who are struggling with something you already have down.

I put effort into the class, both because I wanted a good grade and because I knew it was the most \"useful\" foreign language I could learn as an American, but it's like as soon as I stopped taking the class everything that I learned left me.

Personally, I have a frequency list deck of Swedish words, which I have set to show me ten new cards a day. This means that I never have more than about 70 cards to review for that deck on any given day, which only takes me a bit over ten minutes. Then I have my other deck, which is for words I actually learn myself (usually through some sort of immersion like reading, I'm currently reading the first Harry Potter book) which always includes the example sentence that I discovered the new word in. I don't make a card for every single new word that I come across, but instead aim to make between five to ten new cards for this deck per day as well.\n\nOverall this works pretty well because I only end up learning about 15-20 new words a day, 10 of which are just passive vocabulary that I don't worry too much about actively remembering or actually being able to use myself. I also should never have to spend more than about 20 minutes a day on Anki doing reviews so long as I don't randomly start adding more cards per day than I do now. \n\nHonestly Anki is absolutely amazing, I would just say make sure you don't spend too much time on it compared to the time you spend on other aspects of the language.

There seem to be fewer Swedish YouTubers that I am interested in compared to other languages, and Swedes don't tend to dub content made in other languages into Swedish, the best you'll get is Swedish subtitles on anything other than kids shows.\n\n\\-Even on the internet it can seem harder to find people who want to speak Swedish with you. Language exchanges apps (which I'm not a huge fan of in general) are honestly kind of awful if your target language is Swedish, and a lot of Swedes that you'll find on places like Discord will just want to speak English with you.\n\n\\-Adding on to what I said above, because so many Swedes are so good at English, I've found that it almost makes me feel kind of guilty if I keep trying to talk to someone in Swedish when they've switched to English, as it becomes obvious that the conversation would be a lot easier and less time consuming if we just both spoke English.\n\n\\-It's widely listed as one of the \"easiest\" languages for English speakers to learn, but that can really give off the wrong idea. It's \"easy\" compared to a language like Mandarin, and obviously the grammar is still easier than German, but that doesn't mean you'll just be able to pick everything up super quickly and start speaking fluently within months. There are still thousands of words and phrases to memorize, so it will still take time and effort (although you probably already know this as you've learned other languages before, I'm more speaking about my personal experience here).\n\n\\-A lot of Swedish people tend to be a bit quieter/more reserved, which isn't in itself a good or bad thing, just a cultural difference, but as someone with social anxiety myself I've found that that makes it more difficult to really get into a conversation in Swedish. This is probably more of a personal problem, but I figured I'd bring it up since you mentioned being worried about social awkwardness with German.\n\nOverall, Swedish is a really beautiful language and I hope I didn't scare you off from it, I just wanted to try and give you an honest idea of the language from a learner's point of view. I honestly have a fairly complex relationship with it myself at this point, I do sometimes question if I made the right choice in selecting it as my target language (I'd also like to say that I have no Swedish ancestry, I know no Swedes in real life, and I live in rural USA, so that will obviously affect my experience with the language).\n\nI'm grateful for the level I've achieved with Swedish, and I don't regret learning it, but if I were to start over again with the knowledge I have now, I can't say with 100% certainty that I would choose Swedish again as my first target language.", "created_utc": "1616615030.0", "edited": "False", "id": "gs34k3g", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_mcbgsn", "parent_id": "t3_mcbgsn", "score": "4", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "FrostyMammoth3469", "body": "That sounds awful, but I can't honestly say I'm surprised, people can do weird things on the internet.

Okonkwo was not a good person, due to a variety of things, such as his violent ideals of masculinity and his overly dramatic actions stemming from his childhood hatred of his father. Regardless of whether or not he was a good person, however, he was without a doubt a person. He was a fully characterized person who you couldn't help but have an opinion of.\n\nThe reason his suicide was tragic, and I think this is what Achebe was trying to get across with the book, was because his story was cut short and we never got to see it resolved. Furthermore, the white colonialists didn't know anything about him, nor did they care whether or not he was a good or bad person, they barely viewed him as a person at all. This is pointed out when the judge makes an offhand comment about \"maybe writing a paragraph\" about Okonkwo in his book, but \"nothing more, because no one could possibly write more than a paragraph about him\" (paraphrasing). The tragedy is that we as the reader can see that Okonkwo was a real person, with the entire book being about his life, but to the colonialists he was nothing. In this case, the biggest crime committed by the colonial authorities was them taking away the African peoples humanity and reducing them to generic beings.\n\nThat's what I got from the book, and that's why I loved it, because I felt like it illustrated how someone doesn't have to specifically be a good or bad person to deserve the right to be viewed as a human being. Furthermore, we'll never know if Okonkwo would have changed or where his character arc would have ended up, all because of the colonialists' interference.\n\nEdit: To make a TDLR: I think the moral of the story was basically that no one is two dimensional and you should view everyone as a complex human being, and that reducing a person or group of people to a stereotype or generalization is a tragedy, regardless of if they are a good or bad person in reality.", "created_utc": "1609707101.0", "edited": "1609707350.0", "id": "ghzr3v7", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_kpqhcl", "parent_id": "t3_kpqhcl", "score": "5", "subreddit": "books", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh4i"}, {"author": "FrostyMammoth3469", "body": "I'm currently reading Spring Snow by Yukio Mishima (almost finished with it) and I think it does a good job of this.

As for the people finishing their courses in three months, it really depends a lot on the course. I'm using Duolingo for Swedish and have might quite a bit of progress in only a few months, but that's because the Swedish course is much much shorter than the French course. If you're learning French then it would make sense that it is taking a lot longer to get through.\n\nI agree that you absolutely must type everything with accent marks, they can entirely change the meaning of the word. I also try to avoid the word bank as it doesn't really help much with memorization. Other than that, I think you just kind of have to do the best you can with what you have. Duolingo is great because it's free and introduces you to the basics in a fun/gamified way, but as someone nearing completion of the course (and who also uses other resources) I can confirm that it really only gets you so far in terms of reading and writing, and it doesn't really help with listening or speaking at all.

I learned the hard way that if you keep switching languages every time that happens then you'll never actually learn any of them (I took multiple language classes in school and then never learned to speak any of it).

Japanese, with its three writing systems and more complex grammar, would probably be my final choice.\n\nThat being said, I\u2019d be really tempted to choose standard Tibetan, as that language fascinates me yet looks extremely hard to learn (not to mention short on resources).

I initially just wanted to learn any of the Scandinavian languages, the reason I switched is because I felt like since Swedish was more widely spoken it would give me more opportunities to practice, plus the various dialects (and the Bokm\u00e5l vs. Nynorsk thing) made Norwegian seem a lot more complicated. \n\nOverall, it\u2019s your choice which one you want to learn, and if there is one country in particular you want to visit I\u2019d say learn that one first, my advice to give to you is that when you first switch it will feel kind of annoying, as you will feel like you are re-learning everything you already learned, just with slight differences, but you will eventually catch back up to where you were at with the other language, and it shouldn\u2019t take too terribly long as long as you practice consistently, so don\u2019t let the initial feelings of being set back deter you.", "created_utc": "1604864266.0", "edited": "False", "id": "gbn6fyg", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_jq29wf", "parent_id": "t3_jq29wf", "score": "1", "subreddit": "Svenska", "subreddit_id": "t5_2scor"}, {"author": "FrostyMammoth3469", "body": "I'll give it a try, tack!\n\n[https://www.heylingo.com/leaderboard/frostymammoth-22767/](https://www.heylingo.com/leaderboard/frostymammoth-22767/)", "created_utc": "1603986221.0", "edited": "False", "id": "gai0l3m", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_jjzh2y", "parent_id": "t3_jjzh2y", "score": "1", "subreddit": "Svenska", "subreddit_id": "t5_2scor"}, {"author": "FrostyMammoth3469", "body": "\u4f60\u597d\uff01\n\nI've been taking beginner Mandarin classes at my university as well as practicing on Duolingo, and one thing I do to practice writing the characters is using a Chinese dictionary app to view the stroke order and then copying it down multiple times in my notebook. I would recommend the app Noodle, it shows the stroke order for the character, the app Pleco is also really good (I think you have to buy the paid version to get access to all characters though). It's important to use an app that shows the stroke order, as Chinese characters have to be written in a certain order. Another thing that can help is to download a Chinese keyboard on to your phone/keyboard and then practice typing in Chinese. It can help you associate the pinyin of a word with what the character looks like.\n\nHope this helps!", "created_utc": "1602008222.0", "edited": "False", "id": "g7x4cgq", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_j67mv1", "parent_id": "t3_j67mv1", "score": "2", "subreddit": "duolingo", "subreddit_id": "t5_2t6ze"}]
