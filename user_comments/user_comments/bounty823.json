I then hired Cody as a coach for some time between 2019-2021 and made great progress and had a positive experience. Ultimately I ended up dropping him because I injured my hip and was dealing with personal issues that made me lose consistency and motivation. But I learned his *general gainz* style of programming and have since used it as my bread and butter. I'm getting my life back on track now though and I'm hoping to work with him again\n\n**What specific programming did you employ? Why?**\n\nI change my programming pretty frequently, I found the general gainz \"half set\" approach to be a great way to get dynamic volume in and it pairs great with other programs. I ran Smolov Jr for bench  twice in a row and used a GG  approach to plan my Back/Lower body work.\n\n**What were the results of your programming?**\n\nTo my surprise I actually made a lot of progress with my GG style lower body training. Even though I was aggressively benching with Smolov I hit post-injury squat and deadlift PRs  from the GG lower body work. \n\n**What do you typically add to a program? Remove?**\n\nI personally rarely do much lower body \"T1\" work, though this has mostly been because of my hip injury. I  find that getting most of my volume in the T2 range to be the most helpful for both building muscle and and gradually increasing my strength.\n\n**What went right/wrong?**\n\nMy main issue has always been being bad at gauging my own effort. One of the reasons I don't do much T1 work is because I often have a tendency to go to near failure even when I'm striving for a \"easy\" or \"medium difficulty\". I also found it hard to lift heavy with short rest times when I was doing T1 work without being afraid of aggravating my injuries - when I did more T1 I was regularly pushing 3+ hour workouts with 20 minute rests and feeling like garbage mentally.\n\nOne style of training I found to work very well was to do the first \"guiding\" set for the first week of a block on the T2, and to then only do half sets for the next few weeks gradually increasing the weights. For example I would do an \"easy\" 10rm of bench at 220lbs followed by 3x5 at the same weight. Then I would do  5x5s of 230 and 240 the following weeks. Then I would retest for an easy 8rm the next block and rinse and repeat. The RM set was always the most stressful for me, and I found it relieving to have to test myself dynamically less often. I hit an all time Squat PR  using this method of T2 work.\n\n Overall my progress on these GG mishmosh programs I've been running have entirely been defined by the amount of effort I was putting in. I've had blocks where I made crazy progress on the lifts because I was eating a lot and counting my rest time and blocks where I barely made any progress because I didn't eat, picked weights that were too heavy and procrastinated my rest times.\n\n**Do you have any recommendations for someone starting out?**\n\nBe very honest with your \"effort\" estimates on GG, doing a lot of submaximal work is better than pushing failure constantly and failing to increase the weights.\n\nCount injury rehab/prehab work as T3 to make sure you do it consistently. As I think Cody said in a blog - the T4 doesn't exist.\n\nAlso doing arm work every day in the T3 makes a HUGE differences in aesthetic progress.\n\n**What sort of trainee or individual would benefit from using the/this method/program style?**\n\nI think someone who is dealing with an injury or other stressor that makes following a consistent program hard could REALLY benefit from a GG approach to training. \n\nIt's also a great way to plan \"backround work\" while running a different program: like GG lower body while doing Smolov Jr for bench. I'm mulling over doing MagOrt for deadlifts next and using GG to plan my upper body work.\n\n**How do manage recovery/fatigue/deloads while following the method/program style?**\n\nDuring the last year I took plenty of 3-7 day long breaks from lifting entirely due to my career and other stressors, so I didn't feel a need to take explicit deloads during that time. When I trained more consistently I would just cut T2 half sets or some of the T3 work as a deload. I am not a good person to comment on this overall.\n\n**Share any interesting facts or applications you have seen/done**\n\nThe approach I mentioned of skipping the \"guiding\" set entirely and only doing half-sets for weeks at a time has probably been my favorite discovery personally.", "created_utc": "1663705593.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ip8p5as", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_xj6vte", "parent_id": "t3_xj6vte", "score": "12", "subreddit": "weightroom", "subreddit_id": "t5_2ssmu"}, {"author": "bounty823", "body": "I'm a German A1 learner and I really reccomend the German version of queer eye on Netflix as a learning show.

Obviously I'll know at the end of the block if my body does or doesn't respond to training like this but a starting point would be nice\n* Since I'm doing so many sets of the main movement can I do less compound accessories for those movements? (close grip bench, DB bench, lunges) etc?\n* right now I'm planning on hitting back and biceps in some fashion every day because I want big arms, and triceps on pressing days - bad idea? probably\n* unsure about the rest of my accessory work, but there will be some hamstring and core work with similiar 5x8-20 schemes and pullups throughout the day when my pullup bar gets here\n* do some basic periodization and change the goal RM set every week\n\nPS:\n\nalso damn my flair is outdated now, guess I have all the time in the world to do a meet report :)", "created_utc": "1585728270.0", "edited": "1585729401.0", "id": "fm3lxww", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_fst8l2", "parent_id": "t3_fst8l2", "score": "2", "subreddit": "weightroom", "subreddit_id": "t5_2ssmu"}, {"author": "bounty823", "body": "Agree that these kids are assholes, but 20-50 is a very wide range.", "created_utc": "1584659677.0", "edited": "False", "id": "fkyzufp", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_flcr3j", "parent_id": "t1_fkxtays", "score": "4", "subreddit": "trashy", "subreddit_id": "t5_2uao3"}, {"author": "bounty823", "body": "I'm sorry :(", "created_utc": "1581718648.0", "edited": "False", "id": "fhmvxvh", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_f34uko", "parent_id": "t1_fhianmn", "score": "1", "subreddit": "weightroom", "subreddit_id": "t5_2ssmu"}, {"author": "bounty823", "body": "I like to roll out my hip flexors and glutes with a lacrosse ball", "created_utc": "1581379692.0", "edited": "False", "id": "fh9ew21", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_f1lk9r", "parent_id": "t1_fh92ad1", "score": "2", "subreddit": "weightroom", "subreddit_id": "t5_2ssmu"}, {"author": "bounty823", "body": "GZCL Jacked and tan 2.0 seems to be the goto hypertrophy recommendation around here.
