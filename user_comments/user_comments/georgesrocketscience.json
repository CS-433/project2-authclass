The very process of learning is connecting something new to something you already know, be it a physical object, a memory, a physical action, an emotion, a picture, the identical thing in a different language you already know, etc. \n\nIf one is learning a list of words, one is likely making those connections within one's brain; they are creating the context necessary for the brain to pay attention and store the information. If you give me a random list of words in my target language (German), that's exactly the process I will use to learn them.\n\nResearch I have read in the past 10 years signals that learners learn *better* by a 'random' scattering of words and relying strongly on context, versus the older methods of approaching words in category lists. Perhaps the newer methods are what you are remembering.\n\nI agree that simply knowing a long list of words does not equate to fluency, and it certainly does not automatically include understanding of grammar. \n\nBut since the OP has implied that reading is fairly easy for them and they have done a large volume of it, they have been exposed to countless examples of how the grammar is formed, through context. \n\nIf one relies heavily on context, one can figure out a great deal of the nuance of a situation, especially if it is augmented with additional channels of information (emotions, actions, and tonation), either expressed in the text or seeing them expressed in the person one is talking to. \n\nNowhere did I state that the words had to be **learned** as discrete, unconnected bits of data.

Take handwritten notes in that meeting of what was discussed and any remedies.\n\nDO NOT surrender any original evidence or notes. Make copies beforehand and give the copies. Sometimes 'we'll make a copy for you' turns into your notes being 'accidentally' destroyed or lost. DO NOT TRUST PEOPLE IN THE SCHOOL TO MAKE COPIES FOR YOU.\n\nAlso insist of the dean that a higher ranking teacher sit in during your exam and a few other ones, to compare the topics and difficulty, as you strongly suspect there is a lot of negative bias.

Also bring a fork, knife, and spoon. You can save a LOT of money on food if you go to a grocery store to buy your daytime food.\n* In the morning at the grocery store, you can buy a meal's worth of COLD food at the deli counter (or a roll and a package of lunch meat). Avoid mayonnaise and fish products, since they can cause food poisoning quite easily.\n* Make sure you also have enough snacks (nuts, apples, whatever you like)... it will be MUCH cheaper here. \n* At the hotel each morning, double bag two ziplock bags and almost fill the inner bag bag with ice from the hotel ice machine and squeeze all the excess air out before you close it. Double bagging will keep the water from leaking. You can dump the melted ice when you're done eating. Wash the silverware when you get back to the hotel.\n* Near the end of your first day, make another stop at the grocery store. Buy a bunch of bottled water bottles (take one each morning when you leave for the day). If your hotel doesn't serve breakfast, pick up some donuts/pastry for breakfasts.

I used to be a teacher's assistant in a language-immersion classroom. I also used to tutor students taking algebra, and I see a lot of similarities in your situation.\n\nIf you can show the pre-final test questions and your answers to a tutor, do that right away. If you can at least show any writings of paragraphs to your tutor , that will be helpful as well. \n\nDepending on what country you live in, tutoring might be free and provided through the school system.\n\nYou have a combination of 'I'm gonna screw this up' types of thoughts which are spiking your anxiety. Being judged(or feeling judged) by another person is a common trigger for this, and at least in class you are being evaluated by your teacher.\n\nThe source is, you don't know what to say or to write, in spite of being in this target language environment and having taken classes.\n\nAm I accurate, thus far?\n\nYou are not alone.\n\nIt is a common human reaction to want to hide inadequacy.\n\nOn the other hand , speaking and writing are skills. The only way to be good at a skill is to be VERY BAD at it , until you become less bad at it, and then fewer errors, and then occasional errors, and then hardly any errors.\n\nAs a tutor, I looked at people's algebra homework and tests. I know it was embarrassing for them, and I acknowledged that fact, as well as math was not easy for me either, but I improved through a LOT of practice. I also told them my task is not to judge, but to figure out where the misunderstandings are and to teach that skill. And in math, it is normally 2-3 major concepts that need to be clarified, and that the bad grades make the situation look a LOT worse than it actually is.\n\nHere's my suggestion.\n\n* Starting now, you only speak or respond in full sentences. If your parents asked if you took the dog for a walk this morning, 'Yes, I already took the dog for a walk this morning.' If you don't know the verb or construction of your answer, have your parent speak your entire response, then you repeat it. You don't have to be perfect about it, just get used to speaking full sentences.\n* If someone corrects your speaking, you repeat their corrected sentence. This helps reinforce the proper sentences. (Listening is much easier than saying it with our own mouth. You need to SAY it)\n\nLet's locate the point where you started to get confused (other than the newness of the language). This is especially important if you cannot show the pre-final test questions AND your answers to your tutor.\n\n* Go back to your first textbooks, if you have them. Or to the earliest textbook you have access to.\n* Go to the first chapter and read the target language sentences aloud, especially of the examples, any dialogs (conversations), and any exercizes from your workbook for that chapter. The Examples, Dialogs, and Exercises (EDE) are written in the beginner's level of language. Speak the complete sentences (if you don't have your original homework papers, you might need to re-do the exercises for chapter 1 ON PAPER, then have a kind and patient family member correct them. On paper.\n* How easy dd that chapter feel? If it was too easy, jump forward several chapters and repeat the process. When things seem too hard, retreat to the previous chapter.\n* Keep the corrected papers AND THE MARKINGS OF YOUR MISTAKES. You want to see the markings because they will point out your common mistakes, and you or your tutor will spot the pattern... maybe you tend to confuse commonly spelled words, maybe you misspell, maybe you use the wrong form of the verb, maybe the adjective does not agree with the noun's number and gender. Each of these is a **separate** area that can be clarified. This collection of writing will be very helpful for anyone who tutors you.\n* If you don't have your textbooks, take a trip to the bookstore and **buy** a 'first year of school' independent reading book. I'm talking a book for a 5 or 6 year old child who is just entering school. *It needs to be mostly made of conversations.* Read this book aloud, and **mark in pencil** EVERY word that you do not know solidly. You will be reading this book aloud EVERY DAY until you can almost recite it from memory. As you learn the words, you can erase the pencil markings. (and if the book is 'too easy', it gives you a sense of accomplishment, that indeed you CAN read and understand this language)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso start watching your tv and movies with subtitles in your target language... with the SOUND OFF, at least for the first 15 minutes.\n\n* It's fine to watch children's shows, in fact it would be a perfect place to start.\n* You are now going to read those subtitles aloud, *at least for the first 15 minutes of the show, then turn the sound on for the rest of it.* Feel free to pause as much as necessary. This way you are speaking in native-level conversations, getting a feeling for how to actually speak this language.\n* Don't be concerned about understanding the meanings of the words themselves. I'm wanting to reinforce the grammar patterns into your brain by sheer talking. But you have to SPEAK THEM YOURSELF, for at least the first 15 minutes.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow that you know where you started to get confused (or you can show the pre-final test questions AND your answers to a tutor), hire a tutor.\n\n* I advise someone other than your family, because you need to feel free to make every single mistake, as many times as you need to, with someone who you have hired to listen to all your mistakes.  Show them your corrected exercises from above.\n* The tutor is your employee (and please treat them politely!). Their job is to help you, and they have no other power over you, and you will (likely) never see them again, so you don't have to worry about them embarrassing you about your mistakes.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: adding work experience, questions about tutoring provided by your school, and idea of showing your pre-final exam questions AND answers to a tutor", "created_utc": "1646386645.0", "edited": "1646390230.0", "id": "hzaqyzq", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_t6a3zk", "parent_id": "t3_t6a3zk", "score": "10", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "georgesrocketscience", "body": "NTA.\n\nfor safety for your birds and any pooping on the people that might happen, please do not fly the bird.

(example: Chapter 5 , Section A). I will refer to Chapter 5 for examples.\n\nIn a series of separate notebooks I have a list of vocabulary words (including the written-out plurals for nouns), handwritten, which is the complete list from the workbooks.

A new line for each vocabulary word-- nouns include the written-out plural-- with its English definition. Sometimes I added similar words that I might confuse it with (eher, echt, etwas, etc).

You have a head start in knowledge, and that is an advantage... fewer things to learn, so you can concentrate on speaking and increasing your vocabulary.

I highly recommend Grammatiktraining Deutsch f\u00fcr A1-B1, by Milena Angioni and Ines Haelbig. The book is broken into A1, A2, and B1 levels of exercises. A thorough review of each concept is at the front of each of the 12 chapters. Full answers are in the back of the book. Most of the exercises are fill-in-the-blank or matching.\n\n2. If you take an online placement test at a web site of a language school, it will tell you which level of classes you should take. It's an informal test of your reading and grammar skills. So a '**B1**' placement would mean you have an **A2** estimation of those two skillsets. \n\nYou are NOT required to pass a government-approved certification test in order to advance to B1 classes, at least in Germany. If you enroll in a certain level of class and find you can't keep up or understand, most language schools will allow you to change to a different level within the first week.\n\nThe only way to know if you've accomplished the skills of a level is to take an official CEFR exam, which grants a *Zertifikat* that is acknowledged by the German [government.](https://government.It) It will be held in person and test you on listening skills, conversational skills, grammar, and ability to write a short composition on a topic that the instructors give you on the spot. If you are living outside Germany, Goethe offers them and perhaps other organizations. Be sure that a passing grade grants you the official Zertifikat for your level.\n\nGoethe has a reputation that their C1 certification is not as rigorous as other testing methods (such as TELC here in Germany), and many German universities require a Goethe C2 rating if the university is demanding C1 from other testing companies (such as TELC).", "created_utc": "1643274543.0", "edited": "False", "id": "huf2bgt", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_sdc3tx", "parent_id": "t3_sdc3tx", "score": "1", "subreddit": "German", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qq51"}, {"author": "georgesrocketscience", "body": "Or 'for the next 5 minutes, let's speak only German, if everyone agrees'.

It is narrated in English by British expat Rachel Stuart and published by Deutsche Welle . I highly recommend them for a modern-day peek into Germany.\n\nThe best teachers relate the material to everyday life. If you're talking about cars, mention current-day models and manufacturers. If you're talking about families, have students write sentences about their own family. Have a show and tell session each week on a topic (food, sports, books, etc) and have students bring their own item and talk about it, either in pairs or in front of the classroom.\n\nIf you are teaching immersion style, have a pdf ready on the first day of the Phrases You Need to Survive An Immersion Class. 'I don't understand', 'How do you say \\_\\_\\_ in German', 'Please repeat that', 'I agree', I disagree, I can't hear what \\_\\_\\_\\_ said', 'I can't read the board', 'I need help', 'I need to use the restroom', etc etc. in German and its English translation.\n\nI still recall the frustration in French class, in the first week, of being forced to speak French but not knowing how to say 'I don't remember how to say \\_\\_\\_\\_', so I remained silent when I needed help. (I talked with the French teacher afterwards and she apologized and taught me how to say that phrase).\n\nThe best teachers have a printed collection of pictures of items, so when there is a topic, students can see a picture of it. These were placed in 1-2 small photo albums (easily portable) and the teacher brought the books each class period. Yes you can also access the internet on your phone but it's easier to pass around a book instead of your phone (for privacy). Staying off your own phone models staying focused on the class for your students.\n\nThe best teachers also taught a fun phrase every day such as *'Jacke wie Hose'*  or *'Das gibt's doch nicht!'* that will help your students communicate smoother and understand native speakers in real life. Make a note to yourself each day of what you taught, and at the end of the month, distribute the monthly list of fun phrases and translations in a printable form (pdf?) .\n\nAdding to what u/Hieronymau5 mentioned, also write those questions and conversation starters into their own pdf, so students can print them out and have them handy.

This is why grammar rules are not taught to young children, and instead they are encountered in school. Young children learn grammar through hearing it spoken (AND CORRECTED) over and over in an immersion environment.\n\nLet's compare language learning to the elements of a house.\n\nGrammar is the structure. It tells you how to create sentences so they convey the meaning you want, in a way other speakers know what to expect. For example, when you approach a house, you know to enter via a door... and you expect that the door will be facing the road and accessible via few or no steps, and it will lead you into the ground level of the dwelling. It would be very confusing if the 'front door' was on the side or back of the building, and even more so if it led to a level lower than the ground floor or to a higher storey of the building.\n\nNouns are the basic furniture. If you have furniture scattered on a lawn, that's not very helpful, and likewise with empty rooms-- nowhere to sit down, no food in the refrigerator, no toilet paper in the bathroom.\n\nAdjectives and adverbs (and modal particles, if you have them in your target language) are the decor: throw pillows on the couch, plants, carpets, curtains, pictures. They add character to the rooms.\n\nColloquial phrases are the music and camaraderie. They make the visitor feel relaxed and accepted by the people who live there.\n\nYou need all of these to function fluently in a foreign language.\n\nAs a child you learn basic grammar through hearing it over and over, in a pure immersion environment.

I never stuck with doing flashcards (Anki or Quizlet or physical flashcards), so this is the method that works for me.\n\nVocabulary needs time and repetition to be learned and remembered long-term. Study often, daily if possible. \n\nIf all you have is 5 minutes, know that 5 minutes of review is better than not reviewing at all. Those 5 minute slices add to your memory in significant ways over time.\n\nOur vocabulary lists only listed the German words. They were preprinted in a physical workbook, so I bought highlighter pencils and coated the words in the vocabulary list using the textbook's scheme: pink for singular feminine, blue for singular masculine, and green for singular neutral.\n\nI talked through the vocabulary list for the sections we already covered in the current chapter, in the hour before bed, for each day we were studying that chapter.\n\nWhat I do in hour before sleep is what my mind concentrates on during sleep. This solidifies the information in my head more firmly.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLet's say Chapter 1, from beginning through the Chapter 1 test, is covered in 14 days (no class on the weekends, but counting those days anyway). Our vocabulary words were listed by section, in the same sequence that we encountered them in class. The workbook for the class stated the entire vocabulary that would be taught in the course.\n\nSo on class day 1, we covered section 1 and half of 2 in Chapter 1. In the evening, I looked at the GERMAN ONLY list of vocabulary words for those sections. I wanted to stay in German as much as possible, so I only spoke the English definition if I had to look up the word.\n\nFor nouns, I pronounced the noun with its article followed immediately by its plural, and THOUGHT OF what that noun stood for... if possible I went and pointed at it. (Walked into the kitchen and pointed at an apple, for instance). For verbs, I pronounced the verb infinitive and acted it out (I would say *gehen* and walk a few steps). For adjectives, I pronounced an adjective and acted it out (say *m\u00fcde* while doing the body language for 'tired'). Etc.\n\nAfter Day 2's lesson, we now reached the end of section 3. So my review that night was all the vocabulary from sections 1 through 3 in Chapter 1.\n\nI kept moving forward with the Chapter 1 vocabulary, eventually reviewing the entire Chapter 1 list each night.\n\nAll along I had been marking the tricky words with a pencil. These were the words I had to look up almost every time and I had no visual memory nor action I could associate them with. Sometimes I would get a strong understanding of a tricky word, and I enjoyed erasing that grey mark in the vocabulary list. And sometimes I needed to re-add the pencil mark because the word became tricky again. \n\nWe would begin studying Chapter 2 in class while still preparing for the Chapter 1 test. So my nighttime review at this stage habitually included all of Chapter 1 vocabulary and the words we had covered thus far in Chapter 2. To give myself some variety, some nights I simply reviewed the tricky words from Chapter 1 and all the covered vocabulary from Chapter 2.\n\nAfter the Chapter 1 test, I concentrated my efforts on Chapter 2, and occasionally looped back and included Chapter 1's vocabulary (all of it or at least the tricky words) to keep it somewhat fresh in my mind.\n\nAfter the Chapter 2 test, I concentrated my efforts on Chapter 3, but occasionally looped back and covered all the vocabulary from the previous chapters as well as the sections already covered in Chapter 3.

( Inside the house is fine. ) Over time this will work wonders.\n\nIf you're attending school in person, changing classes at your normal times will do the same thing during the day. If you are telecommuting, try attending standing up for at least part of every class. You might have to put a stack of books or a thick sturdy box under the computer or tilt the screen back so the camera still shows your face. Use a clipboard to hold any papers you need to write on.\n\nThe largest muscles in your body are in the thighs, so concentrate on walking and stair climbing. Running/jogging is not necessary and can in fact be damaging to your joints if you don't have the proper (new, well-fitting, **designed-for-running**) shoes.\n\nIf your house has stairs, congratulations, that is your first piece of gym equipment (a built-in Stairmaster). WALKING up the stairs multiple times a day will do wonders. No need to run. Hold the railing.\n\nDrink 5 cups of water for every cup of soda (same cup size for both). This will keep you hydrated and less likely to binge on soda or food. Your skin will look healthier and you will likely feel more energetic.\n\nRegarding the fast food, stay away from salty food if you can (salt encourages the body to hold water). Maybe brush most of the salt off french fries with your fingertips or a paper napkin, to reduce the amount of salt you're eating. Peel off breading. Scrape sauces off the meat if you can, especially if those sauces are sweetened or thick (sweet and sour Chinese food, for example). Eat the meat and fresh vegetables part but skip lots of condiments.\n\nIf you have your own spending money, buy real cheese, fresh fruit, and vegetables to eat raw, and perhaps keep the nonrefrigerated stuff in your room. If you can, do the grocery shopping once in a while and buy healthier food alongside the other stuff on the list. When you eat out with friends, choose your food wisely. Maybe one small helping of the sauce-laden, salty, breaded stuff and the rest of the meal is healthier food. If you have a choice, aim for darker bread (whole wheat or rye) instead of overprocessed 'wonder bread'.\n\nYou are likely not getting enough nutrients on a mostly-fast-food diet, so take a multivitamin.\n\nWhen you do eat snack food (and I encourage you to have some, no need to deprive yourself completely), pour yourself a bowl and eat out of that. Avoid eating out of the bag, which can easily lead to eating more than you planned. Sit away from the bag or move it out of your reach.\n\nI hope those ideas are helpful\n\nEdit: clarifying the 3rd paragraph", "created_utc": "1639576260.0", "edited": "1639576810.0", "id": "hon6lxb", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_rgpnmo", "parent_id": "t3_rgpnmo", "score": "2", "subreddit": "TooAfraidToAsk", "subreddit_id": "t5_2ssp7"}, {"author": "georgesrocketscience", "body": "My female friends say:\n\n* plan your pap smear appointment for a day when you are not having your period, because the blood interferes with the accuracy of the test. \n* And it's best to aim for the week following your period, when the breasts will be less sensitive and any bloat from PMS will be gone", "created_utc": "1639573202.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hon0t11", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_rgdr3t", "parent_id": "t3_rgdr3t", "score": "1", "subreddit": "TooAfraidToAsk", "subreddit_id": "t5_2ssp7"}, {"author": "georgesrocketscience", "body": "And that dismissal is instantaneous.

Learning is all about establishing connections between things. In your case, this particular arrangement of letters = the concept or physical item you already know.\n\nYou are learning a new collection of letters (or a symbol) that you need connect to either the word in your native language or to some other representation of the concept/physical item. The word in your Native Language is a bridge to the concept/item.\n\nIf you need to use the Native Language 'bridge' approach, it can slow you down, however it can still get the job done. \n\nThe direct connection from word in your Target Language to the concept/item will be faster in the long run. This is why instructors try to install this direct connection in your head. Use pictures in your head,  a picture you are familiar with, or a motion of your hand or body to connect the TL to the concept. For intangible concepts such as emotions and attitudes (distressed, complacent, courageous) I find a split second movie in my mind works best to make that direct connection: for example, a split second clip in my mind of someone acting distressed.\n\nI think moving from the 'bridge' approach to the direct connection is a matter of practice. The more familiar I am with a German word, the faster I am able to use a direct connection.\n\nWords in German that sounded a lot like the English word (*die Tomate* = tomato) are pretty easy in my brain because I can jump from *die Tomate* directly to a mental image of the red fruit. \n\nIn contrast, *peinlich* = embarrassing.

To let glue do its work?\n\nThe English word *set* could mean\n\n* as a noun: a collection of items (*a set of silverware*)\n* as an adjective: the result of letting glue take complete hold (*The broken handle is set so I can use the coffee cup again*)\n* as an adjective: to finalize something (*The rules of the game are set, so play fair and let's begin*)\n* as a verb: to be moving into place (a bowl on a table, me onto the seat of a chair)\n* in a colloquial saying: *'You're all set''* or *'I'm set'*\n\netc.\n\nIdentifying which part of speech it is (used as a subject, a verb, an adjective, etc) is half the battle.", "created_utc": "1628696067.0", "edited": "False", "id": "h8jmj05", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_p2efg3", "parent_id": "t3_p2efg3", "score": "5", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "georgesrocketscience", "body": "Get on your feet.

When reciting the plural form, imagine yourself in an appliance store and point at all the refrigerators (or find a picture online so you can bring it to mind quickly in the future).\n\nIf it's an adjective, act it out, and when possible do it in pairs of opposites. *Langsam*\\--> walk slowly while you say the word.

To me, this sounds close to Albert, and I remember a fictional story about Prince Albert playing games with a friend and their children during a party. I imagine all of them laughing and acting silly in the process. So '*albern*' gets connected to its definition of playful, silly, frivolous.\n\nYour brain doesn't give a darn about a certain arrangement of letters on a page.
