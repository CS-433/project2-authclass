I don't think you can garner the same kind of hatred for a character in a more effective way than to have him be a child rapist. Except maybe if he were a serial child rapist. There is no amount of murder, disrespecting women, or any other dastardly deed towards others that could equal in vileness to the rape of a pure-spirited 14 year old girl, robbing her of her innocence and childhood. There's nothing else that could make me hate this guy more, so I think the scene definitely added to the story in that capacity. \n\nI can see how too much detail may thwart a lot of readers, but I think the gruesome detail is actually a reality of life. There *really* are people out there who have the desire to do things like that and you are largely seeing the scene through William's eyes. This is what, to me, makes it hit home so hard. It's more than just an evil act that we hear about the emotional aftermath of, us reading William's frustration and ecstasy during the act 100% adds to the repugnance of the scene and his character. \n\nGood art is, amongst other things, a good representation and abstraction of reality and I don't think rape should be discounted as such because of its repulsiveness. Rape isn't some special aspect of reality that should get special treatment by being excluded from art, nor should other kinds of sex or something like murder which were often omitted in victorian literature. Crime and punishment would not be what it is without the detailed scene of Raskolnikov murdering the pawn broker in a delirium. The film Irreversible would not have been what it was without the rape scene in the tunnel. If it's a matter of not being able to stomach extreme suffering and degradation that's one thing, but to disregard its artistic value is going too far. Not every aspect of art is supposed to make you feel good, and often times the best art triggers emotional states that do the exact opposite. \n\nRape as a literary device was probably overused in the book, I'll give you that, but the initial instance of William's rape of Aliena was integral in the development of the story, plot, and characters. Its definitely not a perfect book and I agree many of the women were written shallowly. The sexualization of Ellen was definitely overdone and unnecessary, but my initial point was about her and the other women's empowerment and competence which shined through the characters' shallowness.", "created_utc": "1662565916.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ingq76r", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_wwov5i", "parent_id": "t1_ing6c7r", "score": "1", "subreddit": "menwritingwomen", "subreddit_id": "t5_3ox0h"}, {"author": "ChaDefinitelyFeel", "body": "How was the Gene Machine?

I don\u2019t see anyway in which you can argue otherwise, its beyond debate that intelligence is a result of neurological structures in the brain, and that our brains are build by bimolecular machines created by DNA/RNA. It then follows that intelligence is in some capacity dictated by genes. In addition to this, in the most successful twin studies of manipulating intelligence it appears it can be manipulated to a little less than a standard deviation. Thus an individuals intelligence is the result of a fixed genetic cause as well as inputs from an individual\u2019s environment. But do not forget that the range in which measured intelligence can deviate from the fixed genetic source is in itself dictated by the genes. Much like how diet (an environmental input) can have an effect on height, but you can\u2019t malnourish someone into being 2 foot tall and you can\u2019t nourish someone into being 12 feet tall.
