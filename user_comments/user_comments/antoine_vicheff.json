But then they started explaining that everybody knew how Bulgaria was supposed to be the last republic to join the Soviet Union and so plans were made to Russify as many people as possible. That included mandatory Russian in school, Russian TV as in like movies, celebrating \n\u201cS dnem Pobedy\u201d and just pretty much telling people to love and respect Russians.

They want it to come back.. in their countries Russian is very important, everyone speaks it, even better than their own language (Tajik, Uzbek etc.). This is absolutely outrageous and proves the point that Russia was and probably still is the biggest assimilator ever.
