It can be very overwhelming at times. Here's what I do:\n\n1. Accept that every day will not be a success.\n2. Don't be hard on yourself. You're actually doing the best you can even though it doesn't always seem that way to you (or others).\n3. Definitely clean your room. It will feel like an accomplishment and clean your mind.\n4. Cancel unimportant appointments and meetings etc. and reject to take on more responsibilities in your life at the moment.\n5. Use timers. I use 4 minute work and 1 minut break at the moment. Figure out what works for you.\n6. If you can't focus or get started, it is often because the finishing the whole paper seems overwhelming. Make a plan and focus on only getting the first step done.\n7. Write down why doing the first step in your plan actually might be pretty chill.\n8. Try to spend a few minutes everyday on visualizing yourself executing the plan. The more detailed the better. Picture yourself sitting where you'll be doing your work, what music you'll listen to, what clothes you'll wear etc.\n9. Do what you can to optimize your environment.\n10. If all of above doesn't work or you feel restless - talk a walk for 10 minutes outside. Don't listen to podcasts or music. Allow yourself to not think about your paper. Eventually it'll pop op in your head anyways, and that's totally fine. It'll clear your mind and make it easier to wrap your head around what to do, help you get started and ultimately motivate you.\n11. Take one day at a time and convince yourself that you can get though this. I'm sure you've done it before.\n\nGood luck!", "created_utc": "1548344776.0", "edited": "1548345021.0", "id": "eeumcoq", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_ajcdsp", "parent_id": "t3_ajcdsp", "score": "3", "subreddit": "ADHD", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qnwb"}, {"author": "jackjizzle", "body": "The people of Venezuela really deserve a nice coup of democracy", "created_utc": "1548343093.0", "edited": "False", "id": "eeujqp7", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_ajbhhf", "parent_id": "t1_eeuidcm", "score": "6", "subreddit": "politics", "subreddit_id": "t5_2cneq"}, {"author": "jackjizzle", "body": "Can confirm", "created_utc": "1548338343.0", "edited": "False", "id": "eeud6eo", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_ajaz42", "parent_id": "t1_eeuagx5", "score": "4", "subreddit": "MapPorn", "subreddit_id": "t5_2si92"}, {"author": "jackjizzle", "body": "I know what you're thinking", "created_utc": "1548049129.0", "edited": "False", "id": "eellq3a", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_ahyz4e", "parent_id": "t1_eel38t9", "score": "1", "subreddit": "MapPorn", "subreddit_id": "t5_2si92"}, {"author": "jackjizzle", "body": "This should be a thing", "created_utc": "1548048868.0", "edited": "False", "id": "eellhlg", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_ahyz4e", "parent_id": "t1_eekpugr", "score": "8", "subreddit": "MapPorn", "subreddit_id": "t5_2si92"}, {"author": "jackjizzle", "body": "We don't need ligter fluid.

I decided to walk El Camino Franc\u00e9s (St. Jean - Santiago) to figure some stuff out and have some alone time. \n\nThe biggest surprise of the camino is the sense of community that evolves while being on the road. I had expected tranquility and time to reflect on myself and my life trajectory. As it turned out, I did learn a lot about myself, but not by being alone. You'll inevitably meet interesting people that will teach you things about yourself, indirectly or directly. Since i was young I had always delt with my problems myself. It is easy to convince yourself that it is not worth it to share your struggles. Since  walking the Camino, I've always thought that the most important aspect it told me was that  overcoming tough times or achieving your goals is not done correctly if it is done alone. Even though you are an introvert, I am sure you will enjoy your camino if you embrace the friendships that develop along the way.\n\nHaving a goal of cooking paella is great and your story is really interesting - it will be a good starting point. However, I think (this is just my personal opinion) you should not be set on making paella each and every day. The camino is about much more than achieving one\u00b4s goal. It is about learning to adapt and living in the present. Once you are on the road, your great ideas may turn into impracticalities or you will feel inclined to buy a pilgrims menu for 10 bucks and get all the free wine you want. Embrace the fact that you do not always know your goals beforehand. Go with the flow. \n\nAfter the camino I was on a natural high for a long time and it was felt by people around me. I talked to family, friends and strangers about the trip and expected everyone to think I was a crazy loner, but was surprised to see everyone being inspired to do it themselves. Honestly I have propably inspired 10 people to walk the camino themselves and I have talked to them afterwards. Not a single one has told me it wasn't great. \n\nSorry for the long (irrelevant) story. \n\nI am walking part of the Camino Norte in the end of July. Be sure to let me know if there's a Paella somewhere on the way ;)\nBuen camino", "created_utc": "1467020322.0", "edited": "False", "id": "d4pnwch", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_4q0pi0", "parent_id": "t3_4q0pi0", "score": "2", "subreddit": "spain", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhd6"}, {"author": "jackjizzle", "body": "I feel like Horford would bring excellent leadership and experience.

First things first. Being from Denmark and having lived in LA as well as having visited every single country you mentioned more than once, I'd say you generally don't need to worry about your safety as long as you're not doing drugs or getting insanely drunk. Be sure to stay in hostels where you *feel* safe and of course take precautions as you would do anywhere in the US. I for one think every single one of those countries and their capitals are safer than pretty much any of the major cities in the US. Maybe except for Paris, where certain neighbourhoods are pretty rough - there's no point going to those skecthy places anyway. Also, make sure you have your valuables on your body and not in a purse that you may forget or something. \n\nNow for more general advice. In some cities they offer pretty cheap guided tours which is a good way to learn about history and to get the *feel* of the cities as well as casually meeting other people. Be sure to book hostels in advance so you know you have a place to stay before getting there (check hostelworld.com). Generally hostel bars and tours are also great for meeting people.\n\nJust to be clear: You'll be 100% fine and you are gonna love it :)", "created_utc": "1465897052.0", "edited": "False", "id": "d48jlcl", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_4o08z9", "parent_id": "t3_4o08z9", "score": "4", "subreddit": "solotravel", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rxxm"}, {"author": "jackjizzle", "body": "I'd say look into the Neo Soul genre", "created_utc": "1465505766.0", "edited": "False", "id": "d42t1jd", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_4n307f", "parent_id": "t3_4n307f", "score": "2", "subreddit": "Jazz", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qmm6"}, {"author": "jackjizzle", "body": "That's true - never thought of that", "created_utc": "1465192206.0", "edited": "False", "id": "d3xr80c", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_4mluoh", "parent_id": "t1_d3x8xfd", "score": "1", "subreddit": "lakers", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhv6"}, {"author": "jackjizzle", "body": "I agree 100%, but thats unlikely - it is not the Lakers way.", "created_utc": "1465109443.0", "edited": "False", "id": "d3wlpqr", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_4mibzr", "parent_id": "t3_4mibzr", "score": "1", "subreddit": "lakers", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhv6"}, {"author": "jackjizzle", "body": "Really interesting point.

I would rather recommend something more accessable for your ears like Esbj\u00f6rn Svensson Trio, Stan Getz(Check out Getz/Gilberto), Jan Johansson, Chet Baker, Dave Brubeck, Bill Evans, Jim Hall or Antonio Carlos Jobim. These artists are more restrained in their play and usually when I put them on with people that aren't into jazz they seem to like it. Of course you will eventually HAVE to listen to Monk, Miles and Coltrane ;) \n\n\n\nEDIT: Also, check out [THIS](https://www.reddit.com/r/Jazz/comments/eho2z/im_new_to_jazz_where_should_i_start/) thread.
