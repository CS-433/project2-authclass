Not for the computer or user, but for the readability of maybe 2 lines of code in the whole program. By introducing this you create an unlinked duplicate of the preference table, and thus an opportunity for data to become out of sync. It is also an inconvenient way to search for that preference margin, finding the margin for `i` over `j` is as simple as accessing `preferences[i][j]` while checking in the pairs array would potentially require accesing every pair during a search, a comparatively intensive and time consuming process. In the end it creates more problems than it solves, forces an inefficient method of searching if used in place of the data it's duplicating, and only solves a problem that could be fixed with a comment in the code instead.\n\nNone of this should dissuade you from continuing to seek out solutions like this, it is a clever solution to the problem and shows great intuition/talent for programming and code development. However, seeking out a clever solution where a simple one would suffice is a trap every developer falls into at one point or another.

By setting `N` to a larger value you create more buckets that words can be potentially sorted into and therefore reduce the average list length. The tradeoff is that you require more space in memory to pull this off. The large dictionary has 143,091 words so 143,092 nodes is your bare minimum of space required, the dictionary plus the initial node in the bucket (as `N=1`). As you increase `N` you also increase the number of initial nodes created, at `N=2000` you would have 145,091 nodes which is only a 1.3% increase in memory required but ideally could have 2,000 equally long lists which could make check up to 2000x faster. In reality some buckets will be very full and others will be empty, so it will be the same as an idealised lower value of `N` depending on how \"fair\" your hash function is.\n\nIn production environments, where someone has to use this in the real world, it really comes down to three factors: the effectiveness of your hash, the resources you have, and the expected responsiveness of the program. A hash that can very evenly spread the words will benefit from as many buckets as possible, but if it has a tendency to group to a range like 20,000-70,000 then you don't really get much value having more than say 100,000 buckets. If you have a super powerful CPU then you can crunch through fewer buckets quick enough that having more isn't as noticeable, if you have access to terabytes of memory however then you can go wild with table size without having to worry about running out. Finally, if you don't need the results straight away you can slowly and methodically work your way through, meaning you can have a modest CPU, memory, and table size requirements.\n\nAs a final answer, in production use of hash tables it is generally recommended to have about 30% more initial buckets than expected items, so really you could crank `N` all the way up to 186,018 if you wanted to. However your hash function probably does not spread fairly enough to justify that, your largest possible hash value is 4,050 (the value of `Z * LENGTH`) so you likely won't see any decrease in check time for values of `N` above that.", "created_utc": "1662812343.0", "edited": "False", "id": "inuida2", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_xamna1", "parent_id": "t3_xamna1", "score": "2", "subreddit": "cs50", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s3yg"}, {"author": "dorsalus", "body": "The labs and pset generally give a set of bullet points in the scope/specification section, that's a good way to start on breaking the problem down and finding easy wins.

You are creating a copy of the image which you reference for the unblurred values but you're doing it as you're moving through and blurring. This will work fine for the pixel you're at and have visited before, but what about pixels you haven't visited yet? How can `copy` have the correct values if they haven't been copied across yet? How can you get a full copy of the image before you start the blurring process?\n\n2. You're corectly checking to see if the individual averaged RGB value has overflowed and capping it at 255. If the average value hasn't overflowed, do you then use that averaged value to adjust the pixel? What would happen if you were to just put the whole blur sum as a pixel's value? Additionally, integer division does not always give you a correctly rounded value, how could you use floats and rounding to fix this?\n\n3. You have `<= height` and `<= width` as your boundary conditions, is it possible for a pixel's coordinates to be equal to the value of height or width though? The indices start at 0 so your lower bounds are good but what does starting at 0 mean for the value of the final index in an array?\n\n4. This is less of an issue and more a style/readability preference. You have 9 if statements that are basically identical apart from the coordinates they are checking. Is there a way to iterate through that 3x3 grid, apply those checks and perform that summing of the RGB values, so that the check and summing code only had to be written out once? Perhaps similar to how you're making your way through a HeightxWidth sized image?\n\nThis is a big dump of issues, and prompting questions.

Once the other version has returned the pyramid it wants, draw a line of bricks `n` long to finish its pyramid and return.\n\nSo if you put in 4 it will go: \"That's too hard for me, I'll make someone else do most of the work\" and asks a different version of itself to do a pyramid of 3. That version also puts that in the too hard basket and asks someone else to make one with 2 layers. The 2 layers version will basket it too and then ask a version of `draw()` to make one with a layer of 1. This last version goes \"pyramid with 1 layer? I can do that!\" and draws one brick and returns. Then the 2 layer goes \"Sweet got my pyramid with 1 layer, I'll add a layer with 2 bricks and that will make a 2 layer pyramid like I was aked to\", draws 2 bricks and hands it back (returns) to whomever asked for it (the 3 layer). 3 repeats the same thing and hands it back to 4, who adds its layer and then returns to you, the user, the full pyramid you requested.", "created_utc": "1657447372.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ifkvnmw", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_vvnter", "parent_id": "t3_vvnter", "score": "3", "subreddit": "cs50", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s3yg"}, {"author": "dorsalus", "body": "No that'd never work.

When beating the eggs are you doing it for a certain amount of time, or are you waiting for peaks to form or a consisten colour? (What are your end conditions for your loop/function?). Then you mix it together (return function results to the main function) and stick in the oven (further processing). Should the oven have already been switched on? If so, let's go back and change the instructions so we're ready to go straight away when we run it for real (initialising variables). Finally we get the cake out of the oven and gather everyone aroud (output final result).\n\nIt takes time to build up the skills to do this, especially if breaking down problems isn't natural or intuitive. You also don't have to break it down the whole way on your first attempt, sometime I'll break something down to 4 or 5 parts, start working on one and find out it actually needs to be broken down again into maybe 2-3 sub-problems.

In the morning, if my face is a little puffy, I\u2019ll put on an ice pack while doing my stomach crunches. I can do a thousand now. After I remove the ice pack I use a deep pore cleanser lotion. In the shower I use a water activated gel cleanser, then a honey almond body scrub, and on the face an exfoliating gel scrub. Then I apply an herb-mint facial masque which I leave on for 10 minutes while I prepare the rest of my routine. I always use an after shave lotion with little or no alcohol, because alcohol dries your face out and makes you look older. Then moisturizer, then an anti-aging eye balm followed by a final moisturizing protective lotion. There is an idea of a Patrick Bateman. Some kind of abstraction. But there is no real me.

At some point she drops out, after a couple of verses I notice and stop as well. Turns out she felt insulted that I sang \"Not much of a girlfriend, never seem to get a lot\", took it personally, and decided to silently cry for the rest of the trip. This was less than two weeks into the 3 years.\n\n* Told me a month in that there was no-one else special right now, but if she found someone better she would cheat on me with them while making sure if she wanted to move on. She had found her two previous boyfriends this way. I wasn't cheated on or used to cheat, because as I confirmed with the previous two boyfriends, she would let you know when she had cheated and what her decision was.\n\n* The above behaviour was caused by unresolved daddy issues which she refused to acknowledge because, in her words \"I'm fully over it.\" It being her dad dying of extremely aggressive brain cancer while she was in high school. It apparently only took her 3 weeks to \"get over it\" 100%. If she was away from a strong, caring male presence, either by not being in a relationship or just being physically separated for a week, she would break down into depressive hysterics until she had someone again. Caring being literal carer caring: cooking, cleaning, dressing, the works.\n\n* This is a more personal one, related to above but more acutely affecting me post relationship because of similar behaviour patterns taken by a family member of mine. She would weaponise neurodivergence and queerness to excuse actions of hers. Having ADHD and anxiety meant she would just drop conversations whenever she wanted to, and would shame you for calling her out on it because \"I can't help it, I have [insert thing here]\". There was never any attempt to improve interpersonal skills. She never wanted to have kids so decided to become non-binary, as it was easier than trying to explain otherwise. No dysphoria or internalisation, just convenience.\n\n* This one is more a me story, but is still a wild ride and is definitely NSFW, be warned. So eventually we somehow get to the point where we go \"shit this is getting long term\" and sit down to talk about if it could last. We reach the decision that it can't and decide to break up. I've still promised to pick her up from wisdom teeth surgery the next week so I follow through cause I don't break promises. Ends up with us getting back together. After a few weeks back we're taking a shower together and I'm letting my fingers do the work on her. Part way through I have a moment of absolute clarity that the whole relationship has been total batshit insanity, stop, wash my hands, turn to her and say \"This cannot continue\", towel off, get dressed and leave without a single word more.\n\n* We stay friends for years until I build up a big enough social circle separate from hers, realise truly how much it's scarred me, and physically and mentally break the connection forever. That was 7 years ago.\n\nApologies for the massive dump, my therapist tells me I need to talk about this shit to reinforce that I spent 3+ years getting brainwashed into being parasitized on all levels under the guise of a codependent relationship.", "created_utc": "1625479177.0", "edited": "False", "id": "h445993", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_ody7w3", "parent_id": "t1_h441r67", "score": "73", "subreddit": "TwoBestFriendsPlay", "subreddit_id": "t5_2uzei"}, {"author": "dorsalus", "body": "\"Kids are cowards Jack!

Getting aggressive and standing your ground over basically nothing is bad behaviour, but the toxicity is in feeling like you have to do that to fit in with \"the boys\", and/or perpetuating that belief onto others.\n\nToxic masculinity is less about a man being toxic, and more about someone feeling they have to be toxic in order to be a man. The problem comes in that even those who don't believe but still perform those behaviours, through capitulation, coercion, or out of a desire for acceptance, are still normalising and perpetuating them. It spreads unless actively opposed or excluded.\n\nIt's fascinating because the focus on masculinity has led to more in depth discussion of other toxic atmospheres. Corporate, hobby, sports, and even femininity can and do have behaviours that behave in almost identical negative feedback loops and could be called \"Toxic *Blank*\".  \nWhy are certain businesses trying to move people back into their offices when productivity is up and overheads are down working remotely?
