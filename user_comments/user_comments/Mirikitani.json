I had moved there from my own small apartment, and I bragged that I 'didn't have a lot of stuff.' Most of it was neatly folded, packaged, and stored away in bags. \n\nOne day I discovered KonMari and I decided to go through my things. I got a black contractor trash bag (you know the ones) and started pulling clothing out. And pulling, and pulling, and pulling. The clothing and linens just kept coming. A lasagna of meticulously folded, unworn formal shirts started piling up. I filled up the contractor bag, and then two more. I was horrified! I had been using someone else's living space as storage for my unused things for all that time. His parents had invited me into their home and I selfishly had filled a whole corner of the room with unneeded, unwanted things!\n\nFrom then on I decided to treat myself, my living space, and *other people's living spaces* better. I filled up more contractor bags, an entire recycling bin for paper, and emptied the shredder at least twice. I got rid of a number of storage bins including an entire garment rack and all of it went to the thrift store -- so much effort for things I didn't want or need. I was only 22 at the time, so in comparison to those with their own home with furniture and kitchen supplies I didn't have a lot. I'm glad I discovered it early. Now I have my own apartment and have those things that make an apartment a home. But I no longer have a corner storage of forgotten, disrespected items. My apartment is always clean and taken care of. I buy second hand or from individual artists/designers as often as possible so that my money goes where it matters. I'm sure the number of things I own will ebb and flow but I know that what I own and what's in my apartment will always be a responsible number of things that I can take care of.\n\nThank you for reading!
