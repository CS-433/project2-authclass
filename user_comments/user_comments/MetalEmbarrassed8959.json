Duolingo is good for learning new vocabulary. No questions there. I found it immensely helpful in that regard. \n\nHere\u2019s the issue with it though. I started off with Duolingo and found that I didn\u2019t know why I was selecting certain answers because it wasn\u2019t explained and those tip pages on each unit were only somewhat helpful. I just realized the answer was wrong and selected a different answer the next time it came up, not really knowing why, which made it that much more difficult to apply to other words and sentences. The app teaches you through memorization and I\u2019d definitely argue that it comes down to understanding much more than memorization. You need to learn to break down what you\u2019re trying to say and apply certain rules with an understanding of *why* you\u2019re opting to say or write something a certain way. I only found some use for Duolingo when I turned to other resources as my primary tools for learning and made Duolingo secondary. I\u2019ve been using the Language Transfer podcast and a copy of Collins Easy Learning Spanish Complete Grammar, Verbs and Vocabulary. Then I\u2019ve been applying what I\u2019ve learned to Duolingo, which has been good for acquiring vocabulary, and that\u2019s made a world of a difference. To see what I\u2019ve learned in action, I\u2019ve been watching Latin American shows (mostly Mexican and Colombian), really paying attention to the sentences. I opted for Latin American shows as opposed to Spanish shows because I find the actors speak much slower, so it\u2019s easier to understand. \n\nI know you\u2019re looking for an app recommendation, but I personally recommend the Language Transfer podcast. The host really breaks down and explains everything in a way that\u2019s easily understandable and the episodes are in small, digestible pieces. It\u2019s been immensely helpful in transferring what I know of English to Spanish. That\u2019s made it so much easier to remember. I was terrified of conjugating verbs before it, but now I feel so much more confident! \n\nAlso, don\u2019t be deceived by Spain\u2019s flag on the Duolingo app. Duolingo doesn\u2019t teach European Spanish. You can tell by the pronunciation and certain word differences that it\u2019s Latin American. \n\nGood luck!", "created_utc": "1655130035.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ic7fy86", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_vbbtb1", "parent_id": "t3_vbbtb1", "score": "14", "subreddit": "Spanish", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qtt1"}, {"author": "MetalEmbarrassed8959", "body": "He\u2019s one of the lucky ones.

Every therapist should be telling their clients that therapy has benefits *and* risks because people will inevitably pull a Claire otherwise and this can discourage so many people from seeking therapy. When a person\u2019s deepest thoughts, feelings and traumas are brought to the surface, it can be extremely painful and difficult to confront. Therapy takes WORK. You don\u2019t just walk in and tell someone what\u2019s going on and walk out after the first session like \u201cwow, that changed my life!!!\u201d \n\nI really don\u2019t understand people who have one session with a therapist or two that maybe wasn\u2019t a good fit and write off therapy completely. Just like every other person you meet in your life, you\u2019ll vibe with some and not with others. Therapists are people with personalities and different approaches. Thinking a single therapist has to be a good fit for every single client they\u2019ve ever interact with is so naive. \n\nSincerely, \nA very frustrated social worker facepalming very hard right now at Claire\u2019s idiocy", "created_utc": "1653844411.0", "edited": "False", "id": "iag414e", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_v0chu3", "parent_id": "t1_iafk2z8", "score": "42", "subreddit": "gymsnark", "subreddit_id": "t5_3jnvp5"}, {"author": "MetalEmbarrassed8959", "body": "By your username, safe to assume you\u2019re from the Balkans?
