Grzegorz Brz\u0119czyszczykiewicz, for example.\n\nI grew up speaking Polish, but I still have to call my mom from time to time to ask if what I wrote is grammatically correct. I'm currently learning Korean and its grammar seems less complicated and more logical to me than my native one.\n\nSince you already know some German and Russian, plus survived Greek, I guess you'll have a slightly easier time learning Polish. There are some similarities with Russian, but they could easily hinder your progress. You will encounter some words similar to Greek as well (a small part of our vocabulary has its roots in Greek/Latin), and if you dive slightly into Polish dialects, you'll notice that we have a lot of German/Russian loanwords (in Pozna\u0144 you'll hear \"bana\" which comes from German \"bahn\" = train).\n\nIt's true that if you know Polish and you talk with someone who speaks another Slavic language, you can understand the general meaning of the conversation and some words may be similar here and there, but I'd still compare it to Spanish and Italian people trying to communicate with each other in their native languages. You have to be very focused and run through a list of synonyms in your head constantly to hold a semi-intelligible conversation with other Slavic speakers. I, for example, find it easier to understand Czech and Slovakian than Russian.", "created_utc": "1635688047.0", "edited": "1635695133.0", "id": "hirhngu", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_qjh0mp", "parent_id": "t3_qjh0mp", "score": "4", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}]
