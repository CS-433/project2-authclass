Because Al Hikma (Wisdom) isn't always \"being nice\" but rather \"the adequate speech, in the adequate momentw in the adequate manner\" as defined by Ibn Al Qayyim.\n\nFor example he Prophet Muhammad salla Llahu 'alayhi wa sallam did not get angry and did not get vengeance EXCEPT if the limits of Allah where transgressed. When someone rejects ahadeeth it's clearly a transgression of the limits of Allah.\n\n\u0627\u0646\u062a\u0642\u0645 \u0631\u0633\u0648\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0635\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0639\u0644\u064a\u0647 \u0648\u0633\u0644\u0645 \u0644\u0646\u0641\u0633\u0647\u060c \u0625\u0644\u0627 \u0623\u0646 \u062a\u064f\u0646\u062a\u064e\u0647\u0643 \u062d\u064f\u0631\u0652\u0645\u064e\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0641\u064a\u0646\u062a\u0642\u0645 \u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0628\u0647\u0627\n\nHe said to the leaders of Quraysh after they insulted him and the religion of Islam:\n\u0644\u0642\u062f \u062c\u0626\u062a\u0643\u0645 \u0628\u0627\u0644\u0630\u0628\u062d!\nWhich translate to \"I came to you with blooshed!\"\n\nHe took off a gold ring from the finger of a sahaba forcefully and threw it in the dirt and vigorously blamed him saying \"One of you would put an ember of hellfire in his hand!\".\n\nAnother proof that it is allowed to answer in a strong language against someone who attacks fundamental principles of the religion (such as ahadeeth) is when Abubakr told 'Urwa to \"go suck the clitoris of Lat!\". Source : https://www.islamweb.net/en/fatwa/209491/\n\n Imam Ibn Al-Qayyim\u00a0\ufffc\u00a0said in Zaad Al-Ma'aad: \u201cIn the words of Abu Bakr to \u2018Urwah \u201cSuck the clitoris of Al-Laat\u201d is evidence that it is permissible to explicitly mention the name of the private parts if there is a benefit which is necessitated by that circumstance.\u201d\n\nBesides,\u00a0Shaykhul Islam\u00a0Ibn Taymiyyah\u00a0\ufffc\u00a0said: \u201cWhenever the speaker is\u00a0treating us\u00a0unjustly, then we are not obliged to respond to him (i.e. the one who insulted us) in a good manner.\u201d\n\nSo no brother, against zanadiqah who make fun of islamic teachings and reject ahadeeth, talking with humility isn't the answer. It is in numerous other cases tho i agree, but not here and I hope you can see why now, or at least that it is legislated in our religion.", "created_utc": "1659131684.0", "edited": "1659131927.0", "id": "ii6m7xp", "is_submitter": "True", "link_id": "t3_waygwp", "parent_id": "t1_ii6kf2i", "score": "5", "subreddit": "TraditionalMuslims", "subreddit_id": "t5_3q3y3y"}, {"author": "Ironmonger3", "body": "I already linked the post it's here : https://www.reddit.com/r/islam/comments/wa20op/the_perfect_husband_by_umm_khalid/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share\n\nAnd my page isn't nsfw at least not from my knowledge.", "created_utc": "1659129732.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ii6hlbn", "is_submitter": "True", "link_id": "t3_waygwp", "parent_id": "t1_ii5br65", "score": "1", "subreddit": "TraditionalMuslims", "subreddit_id": "t5_3q3y3y"}, {"author": "Ironmonger3", "body": "Maybe be honest and see what what said before that right?", "created_utc": "1659129677.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ii6hgjk", "is_submitter": "True", "link_id": "t3_waygwp", "parent_id": "t1_ii5fvgj", "score": "4", "subreddit": "TraditionalMuslims", "subreddit_id": "t5_3q3y3y"}, {"author": "Ironmonger3", "body": "Ameen wa iyyak", "created_utc": "1659103907.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ii4obpp", "is_submitter": "True", "link_id": "t3_waygwp", "parent_id": "t1_ii4fahm", "score": "5", "subreddit": "TraditionalMuslims", "subreddit_id": "t5_3q3y3y"}, {"author": "Ironmonger3", "body": "You gave me a laugh brother, jazaka Llahu khayran \ud83d\ude01", "created_utc": "1659099651.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ii4es1s", "is_submitter": "True", "link_id": "t3_waygwp", "parent_id": "t1_ii48qam", "score": "8", "subreddit": "TraditionalMuslims", "subreddit_id": "t5_3q3y3y"}, {"author": "Ironmonger3", "body": "You nailed it.

Plus there are different time zones that are outside your american bubble but you may not be aware of this fact. But if i'm so worthless why did you spoke to me first and kept responding and can't let go ? Obviously you can't let go because your ego doesn't let you, you think that boasting online behind a screen or a mic is a \"win\" because you can't do it IRL. Again I'm totally serious about meeting up because I know you would not talk to me like that face to face, even if you're 6'4 260lbs. I tought you were a warrior/no safe space guy ? Obviously the podcast is your safe space so let's meet face to face, dm me and i won't back down i promise.\n\nAnd again english is my 4th language, on the 6 languages I speak you can check my post history to verify that because you love it. So you don't realize the irony of you trying to sound condescending, you're only showing how egocentric and narrow your field of thinking is.\n\nYou come at me agressively and insulting about a damn typo. How shallow must you be to be triggered by it that much. And yes I'm not afraid of saying i've been an idiot on a specific matter because that's how a man grows, he recognize his mistake and fixes it. A manchild edgelord like you can't. And I'm not afraid about giving my physical stats because I'm secure about myself, I most probably would wreck your PR in a gym environment, you've probably never done a handstand or never benched above 225lbs. But I'm being humble about it on my other posts & communities because I'm talking to veterans and experts of the game so I approach them with respect so I can learn from them. That's called respect and humbleness. Your narcissist stalking brain can't understand that because it's too outside of its realm. You can never reach humbleness nor real growth with your shitty prepubescent edgelord mindset.\n\nI really don't care about you, you're clearly some kind of narcissistic pervert profile,  egomaniac manchild, but if you have an atom of manhood in your pathetic being, dm me and let's meet face to face and see if you still talk like that. If you're afraid that I'd do something bad to you i offer that we meet in a public place. That is fair I think. Let's meet and see if you back up your bark. I'm old school i deal with idiot face to face. Again : let's meet like men or shut it like a bitch. My dm are open we can agree on a location. We're talking real life now, if you talk the talk, walk the walk or admit you're just an internet incel keyboard warrior and that's it. \n\nDM me and meet me, man to man, no internet bullshit, no comments just to stroke your ego that lacks self acceptance, just a real meeting face to face like true men with testosterone do. Or just write another edgelord virgin comment, you'll probably do the second anyway. If it's the second i don't care about you because i don't care about keyboard warriors who are too afraid to back up their bark cause they're weak minded, weak spirited and fear confrontation even when they instigate it.
