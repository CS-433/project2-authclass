I chose to learn Korean first and I am now starting Japanese with a later goal of learning Mandarin.\n\nI chose to learn Korean first simply because it had the easiest writing system to learn. I was also more interested in Korean music, television and film so it seemed a lot easier to immerse myself in the language.\n\nJapanese and Korean grammar structure is almost identical so once you have learnt one, the other becomes much easier - especially if you are a native English speaker and not used to the grammar at first. Mandarin grammar is the simplest and most similar to English grammar but the writing system, and use of tones in speech make it difficult to approach.\n\nI would recommend Korean -> Japanese -> Mandarin as the order to best suit a beginner to learning language as once you\u2019ve tackled the easier Korean writing system you can get into the grammar that will help you with Japanese later down the line. Once you have dealt with Japanese and Korean grammar and hanja/kanji you would have two languages under your belt and have much more ease with tackling a more complex language like Mandarin. For reference, I am aiming to learn Japanese using Korean material rather than English material due to the closer nature between the two.\n\nHowever, I think the most important thing is to have an interest and passion so I would choose the one you can find more immersive and enjoyable material in as a starting point!", "created_utc": "1642042215.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hsfqz4e", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_rr7iw4", "parent_id": "t3_rr7iw4", "score": "1", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "chuSEO_06", "body": "I think they might be hosting a fight or making their own boxing company.
