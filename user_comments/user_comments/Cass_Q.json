Well, I called back and told them that I was fine with waiting until September as long as Diana would refill my prescription because I would be out before my appointment in September.  Diana checked my chart and said she wouldn't refill my prescription because my EKG with the cardiologist was abnormal and won't refill it until she, specifically,  ran another one.  I tried multiple times to get them to reschedule an earlier appointment,  no good.  I tried to explain that I had already been cleared by the cardiologist to take the medicine and she wouldn't hear it.  I pleaded with her to just talk with the cardiologist and she wasn't doing it.  I finally got so frustrated that I drove to the office, planted myself in front of the receptionist and told her I wasn't leaving until I had a prescription refill or an earlier appointment.
