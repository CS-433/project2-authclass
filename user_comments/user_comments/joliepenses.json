Frustration is the enemy of progress. Take a breather, be kind on yourself, and go back to something catered to a beginner or children's media, or something slowed down. I guarantee you're understanding of those materials will be better than before. \nGo back to easier input that you understand better as often as you need. Polyglots do it all the time, even if most don't admit it. \n\n2) Do a little bit less each day. Avoid getting bogged down. Remember that is it a marathon, not a sprint. We all know this but also forget when we start thinking \"I'm not learning fast enough\" The important thing is consistency, not actual minutes spent. It does no good to try to set an hour a day goal and then only hit it 3 times a week and beat yourself up. Trust me, short daily practice will help more. It also prevents that dreaded frustration\n\n3) Start logging your studies and what things, shows, or grammar you find difficult to understand.
