It runs between Nagasaki Station and Takeoonsen Station over 66 km. It was planned 50 years ago, and people in towns with Shinkansen stations have been looking forward to it.\n\nWhen using the Shinkansen and a limited express train, it is 30 minutes shorter getting from Nagasaki Station to Hakata Station in Fukuoka. The trip takes about an hour and 20 minutes.\n\nSaga Prefecture has been against making a Shinkansen between Takeoonsen Station and Hakata Station, where a limited express train runs now. Their reason is that the current limited express may go away and it may be inconvenient and cost money, so they are in talks with the national government.\n\nThe Nishi Kyushu Shinkansen is not connected with other Shinkansen. To get to Nagasaki Station from Osaka and other places through Hakata Station, there are two transfers. It seems that there is a need to think about how to increase riders using the Shinkansen for travel or work.\n\n[Asahi article](https://www.asahi.com/ajw/articles/14726033)", "created_utc": "1664238684.0", "edited": "False", "id": "iq1ks0h", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_xocbhw", "parent_id": "t3_xocbhw", "score": "1", "subreddit": "NHKEasyNews", "subreddit_id": "t5_33lye"}, {"author": "funtonite", "body": "u/Bree867 thank you for the Pollock for the r/raoc_meta Week 34 Painting challenge!

This year for the first festival in a long while, 15000 people from around the world came to the town of around 10000 people. They threw tomatoes at each other, making a lot of noise, and had fun laying down and taking pictures in the streets, which were completely red from the tomatoes.\n\nThis festival is known as the largest food fight event in the world. This year they used over 100 tons of tomatoes and the town became completely red.\n\nA man from India said \"I had fun dancing and having a good time with people from lots of countries. This was the best day of this year.\"\n\n[NHK World article](https://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/en/news/20220901_05/)", "created_utc": "1662333901.0", "edited": "False", "id": "in48m4p", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_x31bh7", "parent_id": "t3_x31bh7", "score": "1", "subreddit": "NHKEasyNews", "subreddit_id": "t5_33lye"}, {"author": "funtonite", "body": "I used to live in New England!

Now some are deep in debt.\nTaylor Lorenz\n18 - 23 minutes\n\nTriller made its name recruiting talent with lavish perks. Now, dozens of influencers are struggling to get paid. \u2018We were made to look like fools,\u2019 one creator said.\n\nDavid Warren, 22, in North Hollywood, Calif., on July 21.\nDavid Warren, 22, in North Hollywood, Calif., on July 21. (Tavon Taylor for The Washington Post)\n\nLast fall, David Warren seemed to be on the verge of a breakthrough.\n\nWith more than half a million followers on TikTok, Warren, 22, had left Hot Springs, Ark., for a one-bedroom apartment in Los Angeles, near a dance studio, where he could attend classes five days a week.\n\nWarren had the promise of stability in the form of a lucrative, year-long deal with Triller, a short-form video app that looks and functions similarly to TikTok. He was part of a group of what Triller touted as 300 Black content creators offered contracts totaling $14 million \u2014 \u201cthe largest ever one-time commitment of capital to Black creators,\u201d the company bragged in a November news release.\n\nBut nearly a year after Triller began recruiting Black talent, its payments to many creators have been erratic \u2014 and, in some cases, nonexistent, according to interviews with more than two dozen creators, talent managers and former company staff, many of whom spoke to The Washington Post on the condition of anonymity to avoid retaliation from the company.\n\nFor influencers, it\u2019s a disastrous turn from a platform with a reputation for paying big money, dubbed \u201cTriller money,\u201d to get talent to post on the app.\n\nThroughout 2020 and 2021, Triller launched luxurious content houses in the Hollywood Hills and inked a partnership with the Sway Boys, a popular collab group. A-list TikTok stars were promised up to $10,000 per stream on TrillerTV. Triller leased a black Rolls-Royce with a \u201cTRILLER\u201d vanity plate for Charli D\u2019Amelio, TikTok\u2019s most-followed creator in the United States. Josh Richards, another TikTok star, got a Mercedes-Benz. The platform splurged on lavish dinners at restaurants like Nobu, where executives would brainstorm with top Hollywood creators on how to take down TikTok.\n\nFar from \u201cTriller money,\u201d the Black influencers were promised $4,000 per month, with half paid in equity, according to documents reviewed by The Post. Warren, used to making content for platforms controlled by other people, found the chance to own a piece of something thrilling.\n\nBut now, as they cope with uncertain payments, many creators allege they are compelled to keep up with a demanding posting schedule and vague requirements that make it easy for the company to eliminate people from the program.\n\nIn late June, after The Post had begun reporting the story, some creators received one month\u2019s payment. In July, some creators began receiving back payments for previous months of work. Dozens of creators were asked to sign an agreement committing to confidentiality to receive their pay or risk \u201cforfeiture of all equity consideration,\u201d according to correspondence viewed by The Post.\n\nAs this story was being prepared for publication Tuesday, some creators told The Post they received notifications from Triller that payments for May and June work were being deposited into their accounts; several received mailed checks. One creator, who had been seeking payment for a deal with TrillerTV for nearly a year, said they received payment Tuesday.\n\nTriller disputes that there have been any problems with creators\u2019 pay. Triller chief executive Mahi de Silva said in a statement that the company \u201chas met its financial commitments to the creators in this program and will continue to do so.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe specifically take pride in our role in creating a platform that celebrates Black creator content,\u201d he said. \u201cNo other medium has done as much as Triller has for this often overlooked and underrepresented part of the creator economy.\u201d\n\nMany of the creators who signed deals with Triller say they have been left deep in debt, and are facing eviction and skipping meals to make ends meet.\n\nFor Warren, the experience has also conjured up questions about the ethics of the influencer industry and whether apps sold as empowering a generation of creators are instead exploiting vulnerable talent. \u201cThis program was meant to make us financially free and to empower Black people,\u201d he said. \u201cThey told us that so much was going to happen for us.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe were made to look like fools,\u201d Warren said.\n\nBrand deals and big promises\n\nTriller gained prominence in 2020, when a number of right-wing influencers, including President Donald Trump, renounced the Chinese-owned TikTok in favor of the homegrown app.\n\nBut its rise has been plagued with controversy amid a relentless, one-sided battle against TikTok.\n\nAfter Triller announced it had grown to 13 million active monthly users in 2019, employees disputed the claim, telling Business Insider that internal metrics showed fewer than 2.5 million active monthly users. The company\u2019s then-CEO, Mike Lu, said the employees were \u201cdisseminating inaccurate information.\u201d This summer, several fighters involved in Triller Fight Club, a live-streamed boxing series, alleged they hadn\u2019t been paid for their work. And in February 2021, Universal Music Group pulled all of its music from Triller after it \u201cshamefully withheld payments owed\u201d to Universal artists, according to the music company. (Triller denied the claim, and the two companies later reached an expanded licensing agreement.)\n\nLast August, it was TikTok that was under scrutiny. Black creators, fed up that the app hadn\u2019t done enough to resolve complaints about White creators taking credit for viral trends created by Black users, launched the Black TikTok Strike, an awareness campaign.\n\nThat\u2019s when Triller began an attack on its biggest rival. It announced a series of investments in the Black community: It signed sponsorship deals with members of the Collab Crib, an all-Black influencer house in Atlanta. It teased a new content house in Los Angeles: the Flave House, which would exclusively feature diverse talent.\n\nCompany representatives reached out to hundreds of prominent Black creators, inviting them to an \u201cAssembly for Black Creators,\u201d a virtual conference for talent to network with one another, brands and industry leaders. Triller also promised to hold a massive \u201cBlack Creator Conference\u201d in Atlanta in the first half of 2022.\n\n\u201cTriller was promising us all of these things, a content house, collaborations, brand deals,\u201d said Roman Parks, 18, a social media creator in San Jose.\n\nThe courtship was rocky from the start. When more than 100 Black content creators logged on to the Zoom meeting for the first virtual conference, they were greeted with a series of pre-written talks by executives and were auto-muted by the organizers so they couldn\u2019t speak directly to the hosts or the brand reps in attendance, according to several creators and a recording of the call reviewed by The Post.\n\nWhen Triller Executive Chairman Bobby Sarnevesht told the creators on the Zoom that they could be the next Charli D\u2019Amelio, a White high school girl and one of TikTok\u2019s most popular stars, many grew frustrated. \u201cIt was like, we don\u2019t want to be the next Charli,\u201d Warren said. \u201cWe want to be the next us, and you\u2019re sitting up there comparing us to a little White girl that\u2019s nothing like our demographic.\u201d\n\nSarnevesht continued, undeterred. With the Black creators\u2019 help, he said, Triller could finally crush its competition, TikTok. \u201cIf we all work together we can build some cool s--- together,\u201d he said, according to a recording of the call reviewed by The Post. \u201cAnd you know what? We don\u2019t need the Chinese.\u201d\n\nThe tenor of the event changed when Sarnevesht announced Triller would be doling out a big offer. \u201c$2,000 a month, plus $2,000 stock,\u201d he said, to every creator on the call. \u201cI don\u2019t give a f--- about the size of your audience. Let\u2019s all start, let\u2019s all be a team. \u2026 it\u2019s time to get collaborative.\u201d\n\nOn top of the monthly payment, Triller would feed the creators brand deals \u2014 including ones from Hallmark and Popeyes ready to go \u2014 and help them broker connections, things many creators said they wanted from TikTok.\n\nWarren immediately began thinking of how his life would change.\n\n\u201cLET\u2019S GOOOOOOOOOOO!\u201d one creator wrote in the comments of the Zoom chat.\n\n\u201cAbout to send my cute 653k to triller,\u201d wrote another.\n\nThe stock was a major milestone. While Black creators are often responsible for the success of social platforms, generating engagement and driving memes, they\u2019re rarely, if ever, given a stake in a company. \u201cThe driving force for the [Collab Crib members\u2019] decision wasn\u2019t just the money,\u201d said Keith Dorsey, co-founder of the all-Black content house in Atlanta. \u201cTo say, I have stock in this company, I\u2019m invested in this company from a corporate level, that\u2019s a game changer.\u201d\n\nWhen Triller sent out a news release touting the program in late November, it was met with a flurry of positive press. Bonin Bough, Triller\u2019s chief growth officer, told the Hollywood Reporter at the time that the program would require a light load, \u201cmeant to give creators the freedom to post on other channels without being \u2018too big of a lift.\u2019 \u201d\n\nThere were warning signs early. Some creators who opted for the Popeyes promotional deal said they were sent materials for Hallmark instead. When they raised this issue, Triller management said they\u2019d have to promote Hallmark or skip the opportunity, according to messages reviewed by The Post. Other creators\u2019 packages came too late to complete the campaigns, or they never received a package. It felt disorganized, creators said.\n\nCreators and their managers were told the program would begin in January, but the new year came and went, and they still didn\u2019t have a deal. By Feb. 1, the agreements weren\u2019t signed, but the creators were still asked to post, pressured by Triller\u2019s partnerships team.", "created_utc": "1661213880.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ile4wjr", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_wupy18", "parent_id": "t3_wupy18", "score": "3", "subreddit": "indepthstories", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r5ld"}, {"author": "funtonite", "body": "[archive](https://archive.ph/20220811014356/https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/08/01/triller-app-black-creators-pay/)", "created_utc": "1661213841.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ile4tln", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_wupy18", "parent_id": "t1_ilbo912", "score": "3", "subreddit": "indepthstories", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r5ld"}, {"author": "funtonite", "body": "If you go to the main setup page there's an example of how to customize the name you see.\n\nExample for DNS-over-TLS.

If you're not wearing a life jacket, face up, float, and wait for help.\n\nPeople nearby can throw something that floats in the water, like a soccer ball or cooler, to the person waiting for help. The expert said to think in advance about what things around you will float in water.", "created_utc": "1656374073.0", "edited": "1656375309.0", "id": "idzq1qe", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_vllg9l", "parent_id": "t3_vllg9l", "score": "3", "subreddit": "NHKEasyNews", "subreddit_id": "t5_33lye"}, {"author": "funtonite", "body": "Cool stuff!", "created_utc": "1656364720.0", "edited": "False", "id": "idz84b1", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_vm602g", "parent_id": "t3_vm602g", "score": "0", "subreddit": "FreeGameFindings", "subreddit_id": "t5_30mv3"}, {"author": "funtonite", "body": "u/its_top_secret I'm a big fan of \u5fa1\u6731\u5370 so I definitely need to head down to that area, especially Kamakura.

This only tracks folks that have responded to my google form for offers.\n\nTo get good data for this I have my Google Form set up to have a separate Country field that people have to fill in, in addition to the address. Some people (especially in the USA) don't bother to include a country in their addresses which makes it hard to figure out where I'm supposed to send the card. Thankfully I'm originally from there so I know all the state abbreviations! The form saves all data to the spreadsheet.\n\n[I used this tutorial (example 3) to count the unique values in the Country column.](https://www.statology.org/google-sheets-count-unique-values/) I made a new sheet and referenced it [like this.](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/75943)\n\nI had to go and edit the sheet where the form data is dumped to make sure that different representations of the same country were all the same, for example combining US, USA, United States, and United States of America. I just used find and replace to make sure they were all the same. Also some of them had spaces before or after so I edited to make those the same as others.\n\nThen I used a [Geo chart](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/9143071) to display the count and country. On the version in Google Sheets I can hover over the country and see the count. I can't publish the interactive chart because it allows folks to see the original data!\n\nI also used the Address column to get a more granular map of where I sent cards through my offers, with circles exactly where the address is.

She makes generative art, cool creative coding projects, and definitely seems like a really awesome person.\r\n\r\nThe project she is running is to track shipping times to everywhere from San Francisco by sending stickers to folks that sign up. She'll optionally include an envelope with an address so she can track how long it takes from you back to her PO Box. You can send whatever to her! [Check the visualization of shipping times here.](https://artatomic.itch.io/stickers-and-stamps)\r\n\r\nThe rule is that you have to contact her with when it arrived so she can get the data! She will email you when she sends it out, probably best to reply to that when it comes.\r\n\r\nOne really cool part of the project is that guest artists are invited to sign up and send stickers to her so she can distribute them in the project. You can fill out the form and indicate that you're an artist in the comments section if you want to have your stickers sent out. If you want a sticker from a guest artist you have to include the artist's name or tag in the specified field in the form.\r\n\r\n[Check the Patreon page for information on guest artists and other project updates.](https://www.patreon.com/KristinHenry/posts?filters%5Btag%5D=Stickers%20%26%20Stamps) You can also financially support the project there, on her [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/artatomic) page, or you can [buy a sticker set](https://www.etsy.com/listing/566506023/support-stickersandstamps-sticker-set-of).\r\n\r\n[She also posts updates here.](https://vis.social/tags/StickersAndStamps)\r\n\r\n[Here's the signup form.](https://forms.gle/33knBQZG9SKn44qQA)", "created_utc": "1652135135.0", "edited": "False", "id": "i7z6mvq", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_tcwits", "parent_id": "t3_tcwits", "score": "4", "subreddit": "RandomActsofHappyMail", "subreddit_id": "t5_273b90"}, {"author": "funtonite", "body": "r/lostredditors", "created_utc": "1652133114.0", "edited": "False", "id": "i7z21kp", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_um1oyo", "parent_id": "t3_um1oyo", "score": "2", "subreddit": "AV1", "subreddit_id": "t5_fuge3"}, {"author": "funtonite", "body": "Okay cool, it wasn't showing for me", "created_utc": "1652132137.0", "edited": "False", "id": "i7yzqyv", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_ulx5yz", "parent_id": "t1_i7yyrmx", "score": "1", "subreddit": "RandomActsofHappyMail", "subreddit_id": "t5_273b90"}, {"author": "funtonite", "body": "Hi, do you see this on the main subreddit page?

Fun stamps too: [Title IX Swimmer](https://colnect.com/en/stamps/stamp/1203188-Swimmer-Title_IX_Female_Access_to_Academic_Sport_50_Years_2022-United_States_of_America), [Japanese-American Soldiers in WWII](https://colnect.com/en/stamps/stamp/1094227-Go_For_Broke_Japanese-American_Soldiers_in_World_War_II-United_States_of_America), [Brush Rabbit](https://colnect.com/en/stamps/stamp/1039160-Brush_Rabbit_Sylvilagus_bachmani-United_States_of_America).\n\nBree867 nice elephants! We're getting good weather here too, but it's pretty unpredictable and rainy sometimes. Already got the first typhoon of the season passing some ways off the coast, but it did bring some rain.\n\nGimmieGnomes Love the bunny stickers for Easter! And there was a gnome in the card, clearly labeled. How fun! Today we got some blue skies, but yesterday was rainy and cold. I have to remember to check the weather!\n\nch037886 What an awesome pop-up card! It's so awesome! Back in my childhood home we had a great garden outside.

Brooks said, \"An American soldier may have brought the sword home from Japan. I will give the sword back to the shrine when I die.\"\n\nKagoshima Shrine said \"We were surprised since we thought the sword would not come back.\"\n\n[Full story in English.](https://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/en/news/20220224_11/)\n\n[Ian Brooks himself wrote a longer article about the process of identifying it.

It was more than towns well-known for eating a lot of gyoza like Hamamatsu, Shizuoka and Utsunomiya, Tochigi. This is the first time that Miyazaki has gotten the number one spot. The number of times people in Miyazaki bought gyoza was also high, and was the highest for two years running.\n\nAfter learning that they got the number one spot, Miyazaki City Hall workers broke into applause and were delighted. A representative of a group promoting delicious Miyazaki gyoza said \"The people of Miyazaki did their best and we got the number one spot. I'm very happy.\"\n\n\"promoting the **deliciousness** of Miyazaki gyoza\" didn't sound quite right so I just put \"delicious\" instead.", "created_utc": "1644794532.0", "edited": "1644794750.0", "id": "hwu9pdq", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_sovtsy", "parent_id": "t3_sovtsy", "score": "3", "subreddit": "NHKEasyNews", "subreddit_id": "t5_33lye"}, {"author": "funtonite", "body": "[Link](https://www.twitch.tv/onehandedsmrunner)", "created_utc": "1644749558.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hwrjfb3", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_sm0hiv", "parent_id": "t1_hvwvkos", "score": "1", "subreddit": "speedrun", "subreddit_id": "t5_2sf9e"}, {"author": "funtonite", "body": "[You can also use Privacy Redirect.](https://github.com/SimonBrazell/privacy-redirect) It redirects to alternative front-ends for a lot of different websites including Instagram and Twitter, so you can use them without logging in.", "created_utc": "1644710506.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hwpny0u", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_sqrwi2", "parent_id": "t3_sqrwi2", "score": "1", "subreddit": "behindthebastards", "subreddit_id": "t5_mmcxm"}, {"author": "funtonite", "body": "    Snow x\n\n\"Run under review\" uh oh...", "created_utc": "1644636081.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hwliwn2", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_sqe2nx", "parent_id": "t3_sqe2nx", "score": "3", "subreddit": "olympics", "subreddit_id": "t5_21of"}, {"author": "funtonite", "body": "   Board cross\n\n\"Thank you for the draft\"", "created_utc": "1644635851.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hwlife7", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_sqe2nx", "parent_id": "t3_sqe2nx", "score": "3", "subreddit": "olympics", "subreddit_id": "t5_21of"}, {"author": "funtonite", "body": "[Video here.](https://v.redd.it/mdvp97kdu6h81)", "created_utc": "1644591503.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hwieje1", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_spyd0k", "parent_id": "t3_spyd0k", "score": "1", "subreddit": "europe", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh4j"}, {"author": "funtonite", "body": "[Video here.](https://v.redd.it/mdvp97kdu6h81)", "created_utc": "1644591420.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hwiebvx", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_spwy3m", "parent_id": "t3_spwy3m", "score": "1", "subreddit": "mildlyinfuriating", "subreddit_id": "t5_2ubgg"}, {"author": "funtonite", "body": "    Skeleton\n\n[Perfect soundtrack.](https://youtu.be/ABr_f0pV_y0)", "created_utc": "1644588535.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hwi7hfx", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_spl052", "parent_id": "t3_spl052", "score": "3", "subreddit": "olympics", "subreddit_id": "t5_21of"}, {"author": "funtonite", "body": "    Skeleton\n\nAwesome story of Mirambell from Spain getting into it.
