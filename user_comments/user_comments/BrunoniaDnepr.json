I always compare it to doing your first chinup, in that the initial hill is super steep and you won't get any utility from the language until you get over it. But once you get over that hump, it gets way easier. That means you'll need to have a good deal of excitement for the language before going into it, to sustain your motivation in the first long stretch. You won't get much motivation in the beginning from just studying it and making progress. That also means if you lose interest and drop it before overcoming that hill, you'll have made no significant gains.\n* If you haven't studied a foreign language to a high level before, Mandarin's not a good choice (unless you're very motivated) because you'll be much more inefficient studying your first foreign language than your second. That inefficiency will have a bigger effect on a harder language.\n* Because of that \"first language inefficiency,\" I think it'd take ***less*** **time to learn Norwegian** ***and then*** **Mandarin, than** ***just*** **Mandarin alone**, assuming it's your first foreign language.\n\nIf I were you, regardless of whether I wanted to learn Mandarin or not, I'd start with a Scandinavian language and learn it to a high degree.", "created_utc": "1652994749.0", "edited": "False", "id": "i990mvq", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_usyvtu", "parent_id": "t3_usyvtu", "score": "1", "subreddit": "thisorthatlanguage", "subreddit_id": "t5_4inj8f"}, {"author": "BrunoniaDnepr", "body": "Nah, don't try to predict the future, especially in such categorical terms. \"Surely\", \"don't worry\" etc. Nobody knows what's going to happen, especially Westerners or Russians who get their information on China in translation.", "created_utc": "1652923418.0", "edited": "False", "id": "i95cul2", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_u6e7sv", "parent_id": "t1_i9434pb", "score": "5", "subreddit": "AskARussian", "subreddit_id": "t5_2xzpo"}, {"author": "BrunoniaDnepr", "body": "Hehe, my first interaction after arriving in Odessa: paying a bribe to a cop.

Think about how Italian liberals were talking about unification, or constitutionalism, what the Frankfurt Parliament or the July Revolution stood for, or how Russian Liberals and Conservatives clashed about Autocracy, Orthodoxy and Serfdom. You really can't position James Polk or Henry Clay into those labels at all. \n\nAnd since the US back then, and Britain before it, was the outlier of most of the (Eurocentric) world, geographically, but also socially, politically and culturally, the Continental labels became the orthodox labels. By the time the 20th century came along, and the US had to position itself relating to great world events, Americans stuck a square peg in a round hole. American Conservatism, in some ways, will never be real conservatism, simply because the US never had some great autocratic monarch who based his power on hierarchical, patriarchal feudal landowning and a supporting cast of clerics.

Here's what happened.\n\nThe Central Powers ceased hostilities with the Russian SFSR in March 1918 (in the middle of the Russian Civil War, which began in November of 1917), after the Treaty of Brest Litovsk. The Bolsheviks ceded Ukraine, Belarus, the Baltics and Bessarabia to the Central Powers. Finland had already declared independence.\n\nThe Central Powers lose and sign an armistice in October and November of 1918. The Treaty of Versailles was signed in 1919, I forget the month. It took like a year though.\n\nMeanwhile, the Russian Civil War coincided with the Ukrainian War of Independence and the Polish-Soviet War. During this period, Reds fought Whites, as well as Ukrainian nationalists (and a ton of other groups like the Blacks, the Allies, I think the Finns.) The Ukrainian nationalists and the Poles ended up signing a treaty to ally with each other to fight the Reds, who were beating the Whites. Red forces almost get to Warsaw, and then are defeated. The two sides (Poland and the Russian SFSR) split Ukraine and Belarus.\n\nSo Russia lost the First World War to the Germans. Then the Germans lost to the rest of the Entente. And then in that power vaccuum, Ukrainian nationalists rise up, as well as the newly recognized Polish Republic. The Russian SFSR gains some of its territories back.\n\nBut at this point, it still hasn't gotten back Bessarabia, the Kresy, Congress Poland, the Baltics and Finland.\n\nOkay, so now, twentyish years pass. The new USSR takes the Kresy, the Baltics and Bessarabia after the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, in 1939 and 1940. It gets part of Finland back in 1940 during the Winter War. It never gets all of Finland, and only gets Congress Poland as a part of the Polish People's Republic, which is a puppet state but not a part of the USSR or Russia.\n\n>All the satellite states of the USSR were a part of the USSR and thus a part of Russia.\n\nSo this is a misconception on two fronts. First, there were 15 constituent republics of the Soviet Union. They however did not include the satellite states. Moldova, Kazakhsta, Russia - these were the 15 constituent republics. The satellite states refers to six countries that were in the Warsaw Pact: Poland, East Germany, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Romania and Bulgaria. These don't count.

I've found the Philippines to be that way as well, where English words have flooded into Tagalog.

Don't quote me on any of this, but Angola I believe now has a majority of native Portuguese speakers. North Africans and Lebanese have really seemed to have adopted French, but since Arabic is such a big language too I don't know if there are many native French speakers.\n\nAnd of course there's Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan. At some point, in the Soviet era, urban Ukrainians who wanted job opportunities in the Eastern and Southern portions of Ukraine, and Kyiv itself, adopted Russian as their main language. I think the 1970s and 80s were the crucial decades here. In Kazakhstan, many people, especially in the northern parts of the country, can't speak Kazakh and only use Russian. The same seems to be the case across the board in urban, educated ex-USSR countries. Belarus become totally Russified, not sure why it was so strong there. Of course, in this case, there was force involved.\n\nI mean, how strong do you think Hindi, Bengali, Punjabi, Tamil etc are, in terms of its presence in media, education, posting on social media?
