If you learn the proper form, it\u2019s honestly not as bad as it\u2019s reputation. I\u2019ve heard the grammar (actual grammar not street spanish) is sometimes similar to Spain since it descends from the Canary Islands. Some natives told me the canary island neutral words they\u2019ve heard are more in line with how their grandparents speak, so yeah\u2026 if that gives you any idea of how to speak closer to that dialect, it gives you some reference points. \n\nSome words (including curse words) you probably don\u2019t want to use off the top of my head\u2026 \u201ccoger\u201d \u201cbicho\u201d for bug, that\u2019s not what it means in their dialect, but if you\u2019re trying to say the Mexican word \u201cverga\u201d you can trade it out for \u201cbicho\u201d\u2026 just know that difference if there ever is an actual insect around lol.

That\u2019s exactly it\u2026 we either can\u2019t focus or we are obsessed. It\u2019s like bipolar for attention\u2026 if I started to feel \u201cdepressed\u201d in any aspect of the language I was previously \u201cmanic\u201d towards, I tried to find a new aspect of the language I would be able to be obsessed about. Even if it was unconventional, eventually it would help me overcome another aspect of the inevitable problem I would have later on.\n\nFor example, met a Mexican boyfriend and he told me I had inherited an accent. I never knew this before, my mom is Puerto Rican and she was born the year we became a commonwealth, and then moved here within the next two years. Was first generation but had my late in life on the west coast, Puerto Ricans here in this area were like maybe third generation or even fourth, but I was second. I had no idea I was raised in the culture because I had never met any other second gens, so I went home, asked my mom words, and finally understood the dialectical differences had made heritage learning so hard before.\n\n\nSo I did Duolingo for like\u2026 10-17 hours a week because the gamification and beginning studies caught me up, and then in my 4-6th weeks I started to do babbling to myself in Spanish in the shower, in my room, and in my car. At this point I bought 5-7 hours of tutoring on italki. I also started to have the courage to ask my mom why she didn\u2019t teach me and ask her to\u2026 the dialect is different and is seen as inferior in this region of the states (I didn\u2019t know this), so since Puerto Ricans are catholic I bribed her to teach me with a childrens bible and accent shadowing. She reads, I highlight phonetics on her accent, then I read. Then I try to translate, and then she corrects me (phonetics or interpreting) and that\u2019s it. Sometime later in the third month I heard some people speaking Spanish and it was almost like pig Latin or Esperanto\u2026 like I understood the conversation but mostly by context clues, it wasn\u2019t familiar to me. \n\n\nAfter that\u2026 I had some grip of the language and was losing steam. Had been through the breakup in end of month 3,but felt learning Spanish was more important for myself than for the relationship. This was a BIG low, I had no motivation but was too embarrassed to tell my mom I didn\u2019t want to learn anymore, first of 7, so I kept reading and nothing else. About a week after the breakup, I understood a whole page my mom read before we even got to the translations. I can\u2019t even explain it, it was just like a flip of a switch? \n\nSo I still was depressed but I decided to just try to apply my obsession towards any other aspect of the language I like. Even if it wasn\u2019t a part of language learning. If I felt like replaying my favourite video game and not studying\u2026 like I was going through a breakup, so I switched my console to Latin America and played the game in spanish, did my meal prep with Spanish recipes, etc\u2026 just lived my life and just integrated the parts I needed to stay sane into spnish until eventually I found new things to be obsessed about like history of my target dialect or whatever. And it would respark my interest. For example, when I felt bored I read about the origins of Puerto Rican accent from Canary Islands, so when I inevitably heard other dialects say we can\u2019t speak it right\u2026 I just was able to retain the interest by knowing that we descend from the Canary Islands current, and their dialect doesn\u2019t, so I was able to prevent being discouraged.\n\n\nYou have to want to keep your attention and find anything about the culture, dialect, you like to ignite a new \u201cresearch/learning obsession\u201d even if it\u2019s on the perimeter of being related to a language, as much exposure as possible. Or if you need a break, take it\u2026 but just do all your favourite leisure activities (away from people) in Spanish.\n\nLately I\u2019ve been using HelloTalk to practice and feeling more fluid, and finally I met someone in my target dialect in person just yesterday! We had a conversation (LONG) at the 6 month mark, and now I never want to stop. You just need to break past the beginner wall, but conjugation tables are not how. Do some Duolingo basics and buy like 10-15 hours with a tutor, have them correct you. Then go from there and learn conjugations from exposure, once you\u2019re somewhat conversational, I think a conjugation table can hold your attention, that\u2019s not how neurotypical people learn in school and so it can feel like we can\u2019t learn a language. I actually feel like it\u2019s an advantage, but you can\u2019t listen to people who say you have to learn by xyz because that\u2019s what the studies say. Our brains don\u2019t work that way, let your attention take you over and be passionate and excitable, in whatever aspect of the language can hold your attention and allow it to become obsessive, because its only one or the other with us. There is no middle ground. I haven\u2019t taken classes because every time I did I got discouraged and dropped out, but now that I\u2019m conversational I feel like I would do better in classes than an average student: I just needed to prove I could learn it.", "created_utc": "1666095383.0", "edited": "1666095961.0", "id": "issl94w", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_y70ex8", "parent_id": "t1_issgpc2", "score": "6", "subreddit": "Spanish", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qtt1"}, {"author": "Rimurooooo", "body": "It depends on you.

You can check social media and see if you can find any immigrants who need an English tutor. Maybe you guys could FaceTime, read some pages in English, read some pages in Spanish of the same book.\n\nHellotalk is a great for this. You can also meet a lot of great friends, and it\u2019s relatively cheap and effective for talking with natives. I think paying full price is worth it, but not necessary. Discord also has servers with communities for this, let me know if you want it. \n\nFinally, watch Pixar and Disney movies in Spanish.

They are less metaphorical and more illustrative. If you think of a dog that\u2019s riled up, they bark at such a rapid pace that an untrained owner will quickly become overwhelmed with the noise. \u201cBarking orders\u201d is similar, you can think of orders being pushed out one after the other in a dominant, loud, annoying and bold tone, similar to the way a dog would bark- negative connotation, this person is probably overwhelming. \n\nIf someone hissed a response back, they probably are stretching their consonants and syllables and it is probably a short statement. You can\u2019t hiss out a paragraph, so more than likely, if they are hissing something out it is a short and emotional response that sounds similar to a hiss of a snake. \u201cSTOP\u201d, you can think of elongation of the S, or a statement through closed teeth. \n\nA growl is a similar response, usually provoked by behaviour of the other or circumstances. It\u2019s always anger, whereas hissing is similar it can also be used to illustrate disdain or being overwhelmed, growling is only for aggression. \n\n\nAnimal metaphors/similes are kind of confusing but if you think of the animal you can usually figure out the ways the author is trying to illustrate the tone of the character. It\u2019s one of the less complicated metaphors, and examples are usually readily available in a dictionary. I\u2019m looking up some other examples but you\u2019ve covered the most common.\n\n\u201cCroaked\u201d- someone is illustrating the voice has toad like qualities, maybe extremely tired, or a smoker, or ill, or elderly.\n\n\u201cQuack\u201d if someone is quacking out their words they\u2019re probably someone that the author is not writing as a respectable character. This is a rare word to use, but more than likely they are writing them out to be silly, non respectable, or goofy. \n\n\u201cGrunt\u201d a noise similar to a pig. This is less of an animal noise because pigs grunt all the time. Usually signifies annoyance, can be used similar to a groan. \n\n\u201cHowled\u201d- this gives an animalistic quality to whatever emotion the character is experiencing. Usually used for two totally different emotions, pure joy or absolute sadness. If you\u2019re howling, you\u2019re probably wailing and the character is grieving some extremely traumatic news like a death. Or if they\u2019re howling, they could likewise be extremely happy- like singing, drunk and boisterous, or laughing in response to a joke with so much happiness it\u2019s similar to a wolf howling.\n\n\u201cBuzzing\u201d this is a noise that is non descriptive. It usually signifies someone\u2019s noise as something that is being tuned out, or a collective group of people making noise, like \u201cthe cafeteria was buzzing with gossip of the principals resignation\u201d.

Then start spitting out Spanish in the infinitive to family members who can speak it, and you\u2019ll start trying to change your tenses incorrectly naturally with words like \u201cantes\u201d and \u201cdespues\u201d, \u201chasta\u201d \u201cal principio\u201d, \u201c\u00faltimo\u201d, \u201cprimero\u201d. They\u2019ll understand you enough to correct you in real time, and if they don\u2019t, then they will just have you repeat back in English.\n\nI\u2019m sorry but conjugation charts and grammar classes just don\u2019t work for heritage speakers unless they already have some level of conversational proficiency. The way it\u2019s taught is the same way it\u2019s taught for English speakers taking English classes in public school. It\u2019s not how we talk, it\u2019s academic English. Learn from your family. I made my mom, who has forgotten most of her fluency, teach me Spanish and now I\u2019m conversational at a child\u2019s level approaching the fourth month. And I\u2019m learning tenses in real time from input and output talking with native speakers. Hellotalk is really good for this when you\u2019re ready, but I\u2019d say doing accent shadowing and conversational shadowing as a heritage speaker with your family will get you to a conversational level faster than any other method. I was *never* able to pick up Spanish in school, and heritage learning I pick it up naturally. Adopting your families accent and sounding like not a native but a heritage speaker is very encouraging when you\u2019re talking, because being complimented on your accent gives you the confidence to push past the embarrassment of your bad Spanish when you\u2019ve been Americanized. That\u2019s my approach and that\u2019s the only thing that helps me when I get stage fright speaking with natives.\n\nKeep in mind many of the people on this sub have C1, C2 goals for Spanish and sometimes even native speakers don\u2019t qualify into those metrics because the knowledge of the grammatical syntax is so complex for that certification that many times even natives would not pass at that level. \n\nIf you\u2019re looking to speak it conversationally like your family does, you need to start with them.

Also, highlight words you can\u2019t pronounce like your girlfriend, and say them correctly in the accent you\u2019ve already acquired. Just say them correctly neutral instead of trying to say them like her. That\u2019s what I did\u2026 but it wasn\u2019t to adopt the accent, but just sound less gringo\u2026 because in all honesty I hate the accent my sister picked up in school, lol. But if you\u2019ve already learned a different regional accent based on the state you live and the proximity to native speakers and where *they* are from, it\u2019s probably easier just to find a tutor to improve the Spanish you already know than to unlearn it. I only learned my moms accent because my grandma gave me grief picking up a gringo accent when I was a kid, so I practiced her accent in my room in secret. Learning again as an adult, this felt more natural, and that\u2019s why I did it. You should pick the accent that is easier for you to mimic like a native.\n\nIf you\u2019re referring to regional words in Puerto Rican Spanish. You need a tutor on italki. Be warned though, because this is a bitch. I\u2019m learning household stuff now and have to learn both \u201cneutral\u201d and Puerto Rican Spanish words, something like a pan can have like 4 different words.

I can comfortably speak it but it\u2019s broken, my mom was teaching me. I did some Duolingo and then started babbling to myself, like a diary. Then started speaking to my mom and it was really bad\u2026 so we bought a Spanish book, I listen, highlight parts of words with her accent, and then read it back. Then I try to translate, and if I\u2019m wrong she gives the correct translation. Sentence by sentence. This has been about 3 months daily. Now I can talk to her and she corrects me as I speak it to her, but she can typically understand me and corrects me less and less. Learning heritage Spanish is easier than the Spanish they teach you in class which is like business spanish, I know Spanish minors that can\u2019t speak a word. Reading/writing, speaking, and listening all develop at different speeds. You have to speak it with her and have her correct you. Also learn her dialect, it\u2019s easier to shadow her accent than to learn the Mexican spanish they teach you in school where they don\u2019t correct your accent. People saying that you\u2019re inheriting your family\u2019s accent as you become more fluent gives you more and more motivation to keep learning.\n\n\nIm doing the same thing right now at 27 and I am learning fast, can speak comfortably like a little kid and my understanding overall is way up there, though specific detailed translations to me are still lost, but I can follow what\u2019s going on around me. Im approaching month 4 of self study (3.5) with my mom, and learning more than I ever learned in a Spanish class.\n\nTry learning heritage Spanish, it\u2019s easier than the method they teach you in school which isn\u2019t as practical for output.\n\nAlso if you have video games, play role playing games in Spanish like god of war, last of us, and Skyrim. Having to listen to directions in Spanish and solve problems helps you think more in Spanish. Especially if selecting the wrong conversational prompt gives you the outcome you don\u2019t want, you\u2019re forced to think and react in Spanish. Change your phone settings. DOTA in Spanish is a good series on Netflix, if you struggle with an episode watch in Spanish with English subtitles, but then rewatch in Spanish with Spanish subtitles. I also changed my phone to Spanish and my apple hotbar to google translate, SpanishDict, and then calls and messages. Only listen to Spanish music. Force immersion on yourself as much as possible, but role playing games in Spanish are good self study since it\u2019s conversational back and forth in Spanish with outcomes related to what you say. \n\nDo Duolingo lessons daily just as a reminder to retain study. Maintain the streak, only one lesson a day. The grammar lessons just remind you how to express ideas, that\u2019s all.

I wanted to be a heritage speaker and inherit the language while I still had time with my mom to inherit her accent as an adult. \n\nHow I approached it- my mom read the short story first, I would highlight consonants with her regional accent (some words are exempt from including an accent). Any words I struggled to pronounce non-gringo would get a full highlight, and I would pronounce again and again in a \u201cneutral\u201d accent until I got it right.\n\nThe highlights are becoming substantially less frequent as I get deeper into the book. She would also help me with translating. Then once I gained confidence I would start translating myself first, entire sentences or just phrases, sentence by sentence with her corrections. One day it was like a \u201ceureka\u201d moment and I noticed I understood the entire page, just like a flip of the switch. Sometimes I still struggle but even then, the words blend less together when she reads now, so comprehension is still improving even if I lack the vocabulary.\n\nI didn\u2019t know this when I started but this is technique called \u201cshadowing\u201d to acquire the accent of the dialect that appeals to you.

Some Mexicans can be very elitist about their Spanish being \u201ccorrect\u201d Spanish, but listening to heritage speakers, I realize that most of them can\u2019t speak Spanish very well either, they just have a mainstream accent.\n\nAfter I had my mom teach me Spanish again and I waited until I scraped the surface of conversational Spanish before I spoke it outside the house, so I wouldn\u2019t be distracted by heritage speakers forcing their dialect on me, and I learned faster than I ever learned before with them distracting me.\n\nI\u2019m a rudimentary conversational level now, maybe somewhere in A2, and trying to get to B1 by January to take immersion courses in San Juan. Sure enough now, I have an accent which is weird to think about because I literally cannot hear it, but like I said, people like it today more than back then (thanks bad bunny). I stopped trying to learn from Mexicans because they just made learning the language harder. It\u2019s not like my mom is from the projects either\u2026 she speaks a proper, neutral PR Spanish, so looking back at my childhood and being made fun of for inheriting her accent makes me resentful.
