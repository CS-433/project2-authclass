[{"author": "Reasonable-Fix-8127", "body": "German and Dutch learner here, I don't follow any specific routine since I don't plan a lot. I just know I need to get something done and do whatever I feel like to do (sometimes grammar, sometimes writing, etc.). But I eventually try to study/practice at least two hours a day (average: four/five). I focus mostly on German since it is my main TL other than my favorite one, so it's really easy for me to practice it, even randomly, without a plan. Doing 50-50 didn't work for me (maybe it works for you), I'd say 70-30 can be good. Moreover, my German is far more advanced than my Dutch. Therefore, I focus on different aspects when learning and practicing those languages.\n\nA personal piece of advice: learning Dutch from German (or vice versa) can be really useful, since you practice both languages in a contrastive way and your brain is able to distinguish them with more ease (according to my personal experience, at least). What I do is translating new German words in Dutch, or new Dutch words in German. In this way, you can recognize potential false friends too.\n\nI hope this helps!", "created_utc": "1662367536.0", "edited": "False", "id": "in5va18", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_x66yjv", "parent_id": "t3_x66yjv", "score": "2", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "Reasonable-Fix-8127", "body": "German is not my NL, but I'll try to explain it anyway.\n\nGerman sentences usually follow this order when it comes to complements: time, reason, modality and place.

My German skills have not been significantly influenced by Dutch (some errors may occur, but you won't get confused and you'll end up avoiding them). My Dutch is currently at B2 level which I reached in about one year thanks to my German knowledge in terms of grammar and vocabulary. So yeah, knowing German does give your Dutch learning process a boost, but only if you start learning Dutch after German.\n\nBased on what you wrote, you're more interested in German, right? Then I'd say you should start with German and add Dutch when you're feeling confident enough.
