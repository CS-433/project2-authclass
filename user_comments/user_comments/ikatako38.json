[{"author": "ikatako38", "body": "Sometimes it is kind of random. Doctors decide to assign a newborn either male or female usually based on the outward appearance of primary and secondary sex characteristics. Chromosomes might be taken into account if they test for them. Sometimes the sex characteristics are mixed and doctors can\u2019t decide, so it\u2019s essentially a coin flip which one ends up on the birth certificate.\n\n>Biological sex matters\n\nOk. Yes??? Nice observation? That\u2019s why terms like AMAB and AFAB exist. Trans people are not trying to deny that biological sex doesn\u2019t exist; it\u2019s literally part of the definition of who they are: \u201ca person whose gender identity does not match theeir **biological sex**.\u201d This is such an anti-trans buzzphrase and it literally does not mean anything. Trans people know better than anyone that biological sex exists because it has been torturing them since the moment they were born. \n\nA lot of people outside the trans community have been making this argument of \u201cwhy don\u2019t you just use \u2018male\u2019 and \u2018female\u2019? Those refer to biological sex!\u201d And then they go on with some crap about male women and female men. Like, that\u2019s fine, I guess.  Within the same entry, some dictionary definitions would ageee with you, and others wouldn\u2019t. But trans people almost universally ask not to use \u201cmale\u201d or \u201cfemale\u201d to refer to their birth sex, so doing it just makes you sound like a jerk. It\u2019s a linguistic reality that \u201cfemale\u201d often serves as the adjective version of \u201cwomen\u201d (e.g. \u201cthe female workforce\u201d). In this case it refers to gender identity rather than sex. \u201cFemale\u201d and \u201cmale\u201d are just more confusing because if you say you\u2019re female, people are just going to automatically assume you\u2019re a woman. It\u2019s better to use a more precise term to avoid that confusion. And it\u2019s not even any longer or harder to pronounce, at least not with the informal pronunciation /ay-MAB/ and /ay-FAB/. \u201cFemale men\u201d and \u201cmale women\u201d is incomprehensible to most people, but \u201cman but assigned female at birth\u201d and \u201cwoman but assigned male at birth\u201d can make sense to anyone. \n\nAnd before anyone starts on about how \u201cif we have to call trans people what they want, then they shouldn\u2019t be allowed to call us cisgender!\u201d Fine. If that\u2019s what you want, I won\u2019t use it around you or to refer to you specifically, and I won\u2019t try to force you to use it.

E.g.\n\nFormal: \n> \u4eca\u3001\u5c71\u7530**\u69d8**\u306f**\u3042\u306a\u305f**\u3068\u8a71\u3057**\u307e\u3059**\n> Ima, Yamada **sama** wa **anata** to hanashi**masu.** \n> Now, Yamada (formal honorific) (nominal marker) you-(formal) with speak-(formal)\n> Mr. Yamada will speak with you now. \n\nInformal: \n> **\u4ffa**\u306f\u7530\u4e2d**\u304f\u3093**\u3068\u904a**\u3076**\n> **Ore*^ wa Tanaka **kun** to aso**bu**\n> I-(informal) (nominal marker) Tanaka (informal honorific) with play. \n> I will play with Tanaka!\n\nWhile not exactly \u201cstandard\u201d speech, we can mix some formal and informal parts for various interesting effects. For example:\n\n>\u4ffa\u69d8\u3042\u305d\u3053\u306b\u3044\u307e\u3059\n>Ore sama asoko ni imasu\n> I-(informal) (formal honorific) their (location marker) be\n> My esteemed self will be there. \n\n\u4ffa\u69d8 (Ore-sama) can be used, often sarcastically, to make the speaker seem self-important. \n\n>\u3042\u306a\u305f\u3092\u611b\u3057\u3066\u3044\u308b\n>Anata wo aishiteiru\n>you-(formal) (accusative marker) love-(informal, present continuous)\n>I love you. \n\nThis example has more guesswork, so I can\u2019t guarantee this is accurate, but this is likely something a wife may say to her husband.

Trying to explain that subtle relationship with  English terms just didn\u2019t cut it. \n\nAnd finally, while I\u2019m less likely to make this mistake in English, I have caught myself mixing this up in Spanish.", "created_utc": "1661929767.0", "edited": "False", "id": "imhrho5", "is_submitter": "True", "link_id": "t3_x1vwqf", "parent_id": "t1_imhpcs7", "score": "1", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "ikatako38", "body": "No way this is a word", "created_utc": "1661909912.0", "edited": "False", "id": "imgtx8u", "is_submitter": "True", "link_id": "t3_x1r2z0", "parent_id": "t1_imgatow", "score": "1", "subreddit": "whatstheword", "subreddit_id": "t5_2sjdt"}, {"author": "ikatako38", "body": "(I love the pic you used btw)\n\nI feel very similar to this, too. I have different, conflicting parts to me about what gender I want to be like. I train my voice to sound feminine, I love wearing feminine clothes, my self-confidence in my appearance skyrockets when I use filters that feminize my face, and I\u2019ve thought about anatomy briefly, although I don\u2019t think I was to have breast any larger than they are now, and although the idea of having a female lower anatomy does sound sort of nice, if I had to choose one or the other I definitely wouldn\u2019t trade my male anatomy. She/her and they/them pronouns sound a bit odd to me, but I don\u2019t feel a strong emotional attachment to them. But as I\u2019ve considered it further, I have just as weak of an attachment to he/him pronouns as well. But I\u2019m guessing the reason she/her and they/them pronouns feel weird is because I haven\u2019t tried them before. I\u2019ve had people refer to me with they/them pronouns on two instances, and each time I got a little jolt of surprise, but I couldn\u2019t really tel whether it made me happy. If you expand beyond pronouns and get to regular old nouns, it gets even more complicated. I rather like being called a boy or a boyfriend, but words like man and sir\nmakes me squirm in my seat.

I mean that genuinely. \n\nThat being said, I\u2019m a little confused with your comment. Are you trying to imply that disagreeing with the existence of lgbtq+ people is a lifestyle? I mean, I suppose it could be, but that seems like a rather odd thing to center one\u2019s entire life around. On that note, being lgbtq+ isn\u2019t really a lifestyle, either, so I\u2019m not really sure what you\u2019re trying to get at. The only thing that\u2019s required of a man to be gay is for him to be exclusively attracted to other men. You hear things about the \u201cgay lifestyle,\u201d but that\u2019s actually just a bunch of stereotypes that no one could actually conform to perfectly, even if they tried. A gay person can lead a life remarkably similar to that of a straight person, which actually becomes easier the more society begins to accept them. As for trans people, a trans woman doesn\u2019t lead a \u201ctrans lifestyle,\u201d she lives the lifestyle of a woman. Being lgbtq+ isn\u2019t a lifestyle because you can lead any lifestyle possible and also happen to be lgbtq+, and those two things don\u2019t necessarily affect each other. \n\n> Everyone is forced to live by a lifestyle that society deems popular\n\nI thought you were going a totally different direction with this when I first read it. Lgbtq+ people certainly are NOT the \u201cpopular\u201d group. Lgbtq+ people have been forced to live by the cishet \u201clifestyle\u201d (or, rather, pretend to be cishet) for decades because cishet has always been the \u201cpopular\u201d group\u2014regarded as the default. I don\u2019t know where you live, but where I live support for gay marriage has only creeped over 50% just recently, and that\u2019s one of the least controversial lgbtq+ issues. I don\u2019t understand why people who are anti-lgbtq act so victimized and ostracized. In many cases they have the majority (or at least a large proportion) of politicians and citizens supporting their views, and they haven\u2019t been experiencing discrimination for over half a millennium. And most importantly, **no one is being forced to be lgbtq+**. Absolutely no one. If you don\u2019t agree with people kissing the same gender, then don\u2019t kiss your own gender, but there\u2019s no reason to make it everybody else\u2019s problem. \n\n> if you\u2019re not an ally, you\u2019re automatically an enemy\n\n\u2026aren\u2019t ally and enemy antonyms? Sure, a middle-ground exists, but if there\u2019s a spectrum from ally to enemy, from a logical standpoint, wouldn\u2019t anything on the one half of the spectrum be classified as an ally and the other half an enemy? The exact midpoint could represent true indifference, but there aren\u2019t many people like that out there, and they\u2019re not the ones lgbtq+ people are upset about. Sorry, this just sort of bothered me from a logical standpoint because \u201cif you\u2019re not an ally, you\u2019re an enemy\u201d is kind of the definition of the word. \n\nThat aside, if people dislike the lgbtq+ community, I don\u2019t see any reason why people in the community can\u2019t dislike them back? If they treat us like we\u2019re the enemy, why is everyone suddenly so taken aback when we treat them like the enemy back? I don\u2019t understand the thought process behind someone who spews hate being surprised when they\u2019re met with hatred back. If you don\u2019t want to make enemies, then what exactly do you expect is going to happen when you tell an lgbtq+ person that you disagree with their existence? Do you expect them to give you a gold star and thank you for being supportive? If you truly don\u2019t hate lgbtq+ people, then why say anything at all? \n\n> Fence-sitters aren\u2019t allowed\n\nI don\u2019t think that\u2019s entirely true. Or, perhaps it is in some cases, but not because of lgbtq+ people. The political climate where I live sharply discourages moderateness, but I haven\u2019t known anyone in the lgbtq+ community to attack someone for saying that they don\u2019t feel strongly either way. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s happened at some point, but I don\u2019t condone it. Still, true fence-sitters are pretty rare because our political system almost always forces people to take a side. Which brings me to\u2026\n\n>I\u2019m not covering those people who\u2026 will do actual harm to those in the community \n\nEvery person who votes for an anti-lgbtq politician is actively harming every single person in the lgbtq community who lives under that politician\u2019s jurisdiction. Sorry, but that\u2019s the truth. Almost every conservative voter actively takes steps to curtail the rights of the lgbtq+ community, even if it\u2019s not their intent. Electing anti-lgbtq politicians to the government results in laws being passed that actively harm the community. I don\u2019t see any way around that. So all of those \u201cfence-sitters\u201d who are voting conservative aren\u2019t truly fence-sitters. Even if they don\u2019t personally feel strongly either way, they\u2019re still actively harming the community.  \n\n> People disagree with a Mormon lifestyle, so what\u2019s the difference there?\n\nThere is no difference. If someone disagrees with a Mormon lifestyle, that Mormon is free to disagree back, and that does not mean that the anti-Mormon is suddenly a victim. The Mormon is free to regard the other as an enemy to their religion. The anti-Mormon should not be forced to be a Mormon. If the anti-Mormon takes steps to restrict the legal rights of Mormons (e.g., firing a Mormon solely based on their religion), then the Mormons are actively being harmed. Anyone who supports a politician trying to do this is also actively harming Mormons. The only difference I see is that, at the current moment, lgbtq+ people actually are facing these kinds of widespread legal restrictions and violations of their rights whereas Mormons aren\u2019t. Mormons are who they are, and lgbtq+ people are who they are, and as long as they aren\u2019t hurting anyone I don\u2019t see why we can\u2019t just leave them alone and keep our disagreement to ourselves. \n\nI\u2019m also interested to see your response, feel free to let me know what you think about this.", "created_utc": "1659252431.0", "edited": "False", "id": "iicuhxs", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_qbgfoq", "parent_id": "t1_iicmi46", "score": "1", "subreddit": "lgbtmemes", "subreddit_id": "t5_3as62"}, {"author": "ikatako38", "body": "No worries, I did the exact same thing when I found this sub too lol \n\nThat\u2019s really interesting in Russian!

BL gives me an escape from reality and hope for my future, if also unrealistic expectations for a relationship. So am I disgusting? Am I fetishizing my own community? \n\nHopefully your answer is \u201cOf course not!\u201d Along these lines, I don\u2019t think all straight people who read BL should be shamed, either. The most common thing I hear is \u201cThat\u2019s so disgusting that you\u2019re sexualizing a sexuality!\u201d Okay, but take a good look at that sentence. It\u2019s a SEXUALity. How it possible for a sexuality to not be sexually charged? (If you said asexuality, congratulations, you\u2019ve found the only correct answer!) Of course being gay is about more than just who you want to have sex with, but it is kind of the basis. The thing is, no one would ever say this about straight romance. When\u2019s the last time you heard someone complaining about sexualizing straight people? So straight romance is totally okay, but when it\u2019s between two guys suddenly it\u2019s sexualization? Now that just sounds like homophobia. \n\nFor that matter, when\u2019s the last time you heard an actual gay male complain about BL? I can\u2019t say I ever have. This whole fujoshi culture war is just cis women   fighting amongst each other without consulting how gay people actually feel about it. \n\nI\u2019m going to address the top/bottom thing too because I see people complaining about it a lot. Sure, you shouldn\u2019t just go asking random strangers which role they are because that\u2019s weird. But it shouldn\u2019t be such a taboo subject either. I think it\u2019s a fun question to discuss with friends as long as everyone feels comfortable with it, and there\u2019s certainly no harm in asking about a fictional character. And for all the people horrified over asking the question to fictional characters who are minors, I\u2019ve known I\u2019m a bottom since I was 13. Roles aren\u2019t inherently sexual and tell a lot about your personality, how you receive and give affection, and even just how you interact with other people in a totally platonic setting. I really wish we could learn to separate roles from positions and realize that roles don\u2019t have to be so sexual and taboo. \n\nAll that being said, I do think there\u2019s some work that needs to be done in order to make sure that BLs are supporting gay people, such as:\n- More gay creators who actually know what it\u2019s like rather than all cis women\n- More marketing BLs toward gay males/acknowledging them being part of the audience\n- Expanding gay relationships into other genres and more mainstream media\n- Adressing the existence of homophobia and how it affects gay people in the story\n- Avoiding harmful tropes such as sexual abuse that isn\u2019t addressed or is even encouraged\n- The inclusion of lgbtq+ characters and relationships other than just gay males", "created_utc": "1659158995.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ii84k5q", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_w8liy6", "parent_id": "t3_w8liy6", "score": "1", "subreddit": "me_irlgbt", "subreddit_id": "t5_3apfn"}, {"author": "ikatako38", "body": "Huh turns out I was sorting by top on accident", "created_utc": "1659152114.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ii7t7wp", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_og9gkc", "parent_id": "t1_ii7kado", "score": "2", "subreddit": "lgbtmemes", "subreddit_id": "t5_3as62"}, {"author": "ikatako38", "body": "Yes!!!

It also annoys me to no end that there isn\u2019t any better word for gay men than \u201cVincian.\u201d \u201cVincian\u201d is not well recognizable even within the lgbtq community and tbh I didn\u2019t even know Da Vinci was gay until I heard about the term. I often get him confused with that guy who supposedly cut off his ear and mailed it to his girlfriend. Alternatively, even though it\u2019s a bit cumbersome, I guess we can just keep saying \u201cgay man\u201d over and over, but, being somewhat enby, getting called a \u201cgay MAN\u201d makes me a little uncomfortable. \n\nSo idk, it\u2019s weird. I feel like gay men (*cringe*) label is not on the same level as other labels like bi and lesbian, and I wish we could make it them all totally equal. The blue gay flag is at least a good place to start.", "created_utc": "1659129711.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ii6hjfr", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_og9gkc", "parent_id": "t1_h4jhzlx", "score": "1", "subreddit": "lgbtmemes", "subreddit_id": "t5_3as62"}, {"author": "ikatako38", "body": "The problem is people use this argument like, \u201cYou can\u2019t get mad at me because I\u2019m just using my first amendment rights.\u201d Like, no, if you\u2019re allowed to share your bigotry, I\u2019m sure as hell allowed to say whatever I want back l to you.

The second one does make an attempt to \u201cshow\u201d\u2014for example:\n\n> a rush of cool air greeted me like a cool friend.\n\nThis line seems to imply (\u201cshow\u201d) that the narrator has a feeling of familiarity toward the store (i.e. they come there often, and perhaps it feels almost like a second home). However, this theme isn\u2019t maintained through the passage, so it\u2019s unclear whether this subtle meaning was intended or not. Maybe it would make more sense in the context of the whole work. \n\n>Smiling broadly\n\nHere\u2019s an example of adding more detail but wording it in a way that perhaps gives the opposite impression of what you intended. Reading this, I wonder why you used more neutral descriptors rather than something like \u201c*beamed*\u201d or \u201csmiled *warmly.*\u201d Combined with \u201csmartly dressed\u201d and \u201c[turning] back to complete her sale],\u201d the clerk\u2019s greeting feels sort of stiff. However, compared to the first paragraph, she does feel more like a present entity in the room because of all the description you gave her. In the first passage, I am expecting her to be unimportant, but in the second passage it feels like she\u2019s about to become a major character. Normally, I wouldn\u2019t read so far into this, but since you said it was show vs tell, I\u2019m trying to glean anything that comes to me.\n\n(Also, the phrase \u201csmartly dressed and smiling broadly\u201d is misplaced; in this sentence, it describes the counter.)\n\n>Moved the shirts on the hangers along the rail \n\nThis was kind of painful sentence to read. We already know that the shirts are on hangers and that the hangers are on a rail because that\u2019s how clothing stores work, so explicitly mentioning it just drills redundant information into the readers\u2019 head. The back-to-back prepositional phrases don\u2019t help either. Rather than adding more detail, it just feels like you\u2019re trying to talk around a word you don\u2019t know. \u201cInspect\u201d is also an odd word choice, so I think your best bet would be something like \u201cI stepped over to the nearest clothing rack and browsed through the shirts.\u201d \u201cConsidering my options\u201d is also redundant, and actually an example of telling rather than showing. \u201cBrowse\u201d would cover this just fine. \n\nOverall, both passages work, and both are well-written! They just serve different purposes. Just remember that when you try to \u201cshow\u201d instead of tell, you have to have a purpose\u2014there has to be *something that you\u2019re showing*. If you wanted to draw the scene out and make it feel like a lot of time is passing, the second passage would be perfect. For example, if you\u2019re building up to a big, sudden surprise. Especially if you combined it into one paragraph, then followed it up with a short paragraph like \u201cI found it.\u201d then that would be a great way to manipulate the pacing to show a sense of surprise or suddenness to the reader. Alternatively, if you wanted to imply that the character has visited this store very often and knows the staff well, you could maintain that theme throughout. The \u201clike a good friend\u201d would be perfect, and then you could follow it up with:\n\n>The clerk gave me a familiar grin and an excited wave. \u201cI\u2019ll be right with you!\u201d\n\n(Removing the adjectives (young, smartly-dressed) makes it sound like the narrator knows her. He doesn\u2019t have to specify which clerk she is\u2014she\u2019s THE clerk, who he knows because he visits here all the time.)\n\nAnd then you could add:\n\n>I stepped over to the nearest clothing rack, checking to see whether there was any new merchandise since my last visit. \n\nThere\u2019s a lot of different ways you could go with this, but hopefully all that rambling sparked something for you. Keep in mind this is all just my subjective opinion, and other people may have interpreted it in an entirely different way.

This is why we\u2019ve been begging corporate for years to allow credit card tipping. Apparently there\u2019s something in the works for it, but I don\u2019t know how far out it is or whether it\u2019ll go out to all markets. Corporate shouldn\u2019t be making it hard to tip, period.

I\u2019d rather interact with a customer who is genuinely friendly and recognizes me as a person than a customer who acts like a jerk and throws money at me afterward as if that makes up for it.

Still not quite sure what the question was asking, but that might just be me not understanding the terminology. I\u2019m kind of now around here. But since you\u2019re curious, I\u2019ll go ahead and explain!\n\nI love Japanese, but I honestly find the readings system rather ridiculous. Dozens of different symbols share the same readings, resulting in nearly endless homophones. Not to mention that each symbol can have anywhere from 1 to 10+ readings. Every natlang has certain features that makes us want to tear our hair out, and that\u2019s one of them for Japanese. \n\nI decided to build off that foundation but for my own sanity came up with a more concise system. The symbols are called Jugoru [d\u0291y\u2019go.\u027eu], and each symbol can be written at full height (Jugorugyo) [d\u0291y\u2019go.\u027eu,\u0261\u02b2o] or half-height (Jugorukon) [d\u0291y\u2019go.\u027eu,ko\u014b]. Jugorugyo stands on its own to form a complete idea, while multiple Jugorukon (also called \u201ccombining Jugoru\u201d) can be strung together to form a more complex idea. Each Jugoru has two readings: a GYO reading when standing alone and a KON reading when combining. For example, the readings for \u201ctall tower\u201d are *tsuuru* (GYO) and *jishimo* (KON), while the readings for \u201csleep\u201d are *den* (GYO) and *mematsu* (KON). \n\nThus: *tsuuru* (tall building) + *den* (sleep) = *jishimomematsu* (apartment)\n\nThe nice this about this system is that each reading of each symbol is unique. With 139 syllables to work with, and each reading having a length of up to 3, that\u2019s 139^3 + 139^2 + 139 = 2,705,079 possible unique readings, so I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever run out!\n\nThe syllabary symbols are called Buragoru, and there are 139 symbols. However, they very easy to construct by combining a small set of diacritics. The Buragoru is used for verb endings, adpositions, loanwords, and a couple common words (like \u201cmy\u201d and \u201cyour\u201d).\n\nNot to self-promote or anything, but I\u2019ve explained it a lot better on my Tumblr. If you want to see the system in practice, you can go to [my first Daily Jugoru post](https://ikatako38.tumblr.com/post/675356017079517184/welcome-to-my-very-first-daily-jugoru-as-youve) there. \n\nThese posts explain the formation of the Buragoru: [part 1](https://ikatako38.tumblr.com/post/676683772349104128/its-realllly-late-but-its-technically-still)|[part 2](https://ikatako38.tumblr.com/post/676683873403453440/here-are-the-tables-containing-every-buragoru)\n\nLike I said, it\u2019s actually a fan-conlang for a relatively niche fandom, so there will definitely be a couple things that won\u2019t make sense if you decide to browse my Daily Jugoru posts, but you can just ignore those things!", "created_utc": "1649015145.0", "edited": "1649015372.0", "id": "i39fec9", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_tv6zs4", "parent_id": "t1_i3946dm", "score": "2", "subreddit": "conlangs", "subreddit_id": "t5_2red7"}, {"author": "ikatako38", "body": "Juburonotako is the first conlang I\u2019ve ever made, and I\u2019m using it for a fanfiction.

Another way to think about it is describing the *present consequences* of a past action.

For example:\n\n>The milk *went* bad because you *left* it on the counter **last night**.\n\nNumbers 4 and 5 can be used the name way as number 1, and number 3 can be used the same way as number 2.

Even if you use a transition word, you still need to have a full sentence with a subject and verb after it. Since the next sentence introduces the topic just as well, you can delete this sentence entirely. \n\nHere is somewhat of a bigger change: since you\u2019re arguing that living on one\u2019s own is better, I suggest that you swap the middle two paragraphs. Delete \u201cSecondly, people can choose to live on their own,\u201d and start with \u201cThe main benefit of living by ~~yourself~~ oneself\u2026\u201d\n\nStart your second paragraph with a transition word like \u201cOn the other hand,\u201d \u201cTo/In contrast,\u201d \u201cConversely,\u201d etc. Then, go right into \u201cthe main benefit of living at home is\u2026\u201d \n\n/\u2026when a lot of your weekly activities take place near your hometown\u2026\n\nI said this already on your other essay, but it\u2019s best to avoid using \u201cyou\u201d in a general sense in formal writing.

You pay *for* groceries. Conveniently, you can both \u201cpay rent\u201d (pay the bill) or \u201cpay for rent\u201d (pay for the ability to stay in that residence). Thus, you can solve the problem by adding \u201cfor.\u201d My suggestion: \u201c**pay for rent and groceries**\u201d\n\n>I want to live nearby my friends from college. \n\nThe prepositions get a little tricky here. *Nearby* indicates proximity to a PLACE.

For one, \u201ceveryday\u201d and \u201cat some point\u201d seem to conflict with one another\u2026 \u201cat some point\u201d implies that the shopping will be done one time in the future, while \u201ceveryday\u201d implies that the shopping is currently being done, and will continue being done habitually. I\u2019d also suggest eliminating the passive voice here\u2026 a lot of teachers I\u2019ve had in the past have been really strict about not using passive voice, but while I\u2019m not nearly as strict about it, this sentence would sound a lot better in the active voice. Before I give you a suggestion on how to fix it, let\u2019s move to the next sentence. \n\n>Whether you need to buy groceries or clothing. \n\n\u201cWhether\u201d (in this case) introduces a dependent clause, but since you don\u2019t have an independent clause to go with it, this is a sentence fragment (incomplete sentence). You need to add an independent clause to it, or (as I\u2019ll suggest), combine it with another sentence. \n\nOne more thing\u2014it\u2019s typically best to avoid the use of \u201cyou\u201d in formal writing to refer to people in general. \n\nMy overall suggestion to start off your essay: \u201c**Whether buying groceries or clothing, everyone shops at some point.**\u201d\n\n>However not everyone has the same shopping style, people may prefer shopping at a large supermarket rager than shopping at a small local store for example. \n\nYou always need a comma after \u201cHowever\u201d when your using it to contrast things or as a transition word. Also, this is a run-on sentence (more specifically, a comma splice). \u201cHowever, not everyone has the same shopping style\u201d can stand on its own as an independent clause, and so can \u201cpeople may prefer shopping\u2026\u201d In this case, you need to separate these ideas with MORE than a comma. You need to use either a semicolon (;), full stop (.), or a comma with a conjunction such as \u201c, and\u201d.\n\nFinally, \u201cfor example\u201d should not come at the end of the sentence in formal writing. It sounds like an afterthought, like your thoughts aren\u2019t very well organized. \n\nYou\u2019ll also see that I took out the second \u201cshopping at a\u201d since it\u2019s redundant. \n\nMy suggestion: \u201c**However, not everyone has the same shopping style; for example, people may prefer shopping at a large supermarket rather than a small local store.**\u201d You can also replace the semicolon with a period and capital \u201cFor.\u201d\n\n>In this essay I am going to explain which style of shopping I prefer. \n\nThis suggestion really has more to do with your argumentative skills than your English skills, but this sentence should clearly state your position. We call this sentence the \u201cthesis,\u201d and it\u2019s usually the last sentence of the first paragraph. In both the essays I\u2019ve read so far, you start with \u201cIn this essay I am going to explain\u2026\u201d I\u2019d suggest avoiding that structure. The person reading this already knows that it\u2019s an essay and that you\u2019re going to be explaining something. Novels don\u2019t start with \u201cThis is a book,\u201d so you don\u2019t need to start your essay with \u201cThis is an essay.\u201d Just keep it clear and simple, and make sure you actually state which one you prefer. \n\nMy suggestion: \u201c**As for me, I prefer shopping at a large supermarket.**\u201d\n\n>To start off with the large supermarket. \n\nThis is also an incomplete sentence because it doesn\u2019t have a verb. However, since you just stated that you prefer large supermarkets (if you follow my last suggestion), the reader will assume you\u2019re talking about large supermarkets, so you can just go right into it. I would delete this sentence entirely. \n\n>but also things like clothing and electronics. \n\nThis construction is common in informal situations, but since it\u2019s formal writing, use the more concise \u201c**but also clothing and electronics.**\u201d\n\n>because of economies of scale\n\nWas about to comment that I didn\u2019t understand what you meant by this, but I looked it up at you\u2019re totally correct! It looks like you\u2019ve taught *me* something! :)\n\n>they are not on every corner of the street\n\nI can\u2019t say exactly why, but this sounds awkward. Maybe it\u2019s too overly specific? I\u2019d just stick with \u201c**they are not on every corner**\u201d. People often say something \u201cisn\u2019t on every corner,\u201d but they don\u2019t really say \u201cof the street.\u201d\n\n>therefore people need more time to reach it. \n\nTransition words like \u201ctherefore,\u201d \u201chowever,\u201d \u201cthus,\u201d \u201clikewise,\u201d \u201cdespite this,\u201d \u201cin this way,\u201d \u201cto start,\u201d etc. always need a period or a semicolon before them, and a comma after. If you want to keep the sentence together, you could use a simple conjunction like \u201cso,\u201d or you can split it up. Here are your three options: \u201c**\u2026they are not on every corner, so people need more time to reach it.**\u201d or \u201c**\u2026they are not on every corner; therefore, people need more time to reach it.**\u201d or \u201c**\u2026they are not on every corner. Therefore, people need more time to reach it.**\u201d\n\nI\u2019d start your second paragraph with a contrastive transition word, like \u201c**However**\u201d, \u201c**On the other hand**\u201d, or \u201c**In constrast**\u201d. The last one works best in this case without rewriting the sentence. Remember that, since they\u2019re transition words, they need to be followed by a comma. This lets us know that you\u2019re moving from talking about large supermarkets to local stores. I\u2019d suggest: \u201c**To contrast, the main advantage of local stores is that they are close by.**\n\n\u201dIn addition\u201d and \u201cOn the other hand\u201d and \u201cAll in all\u201d need commas after them. \n\n\u201cexpect a better customer service\u201d should just be \u201c**expect better customer service**\u201d. *Customer service* is uncountable (one customer service, two customer services?), so you don\u2019t use \u201ca\u201d.\n\n\u201ccosts of shopping\u201d \u2192 \u201c**prices**\u201d\n\n\u2014\n\nWhew! Okay, take a deep breath! I know that was a lot, and much of it was rather nitpicky. Let\u2019s focus on the most important part for a moment: *I could understand perfectly everything you were trying to say.* You obviously have a good handle on the language, and I can tell that you can probably hold a conversation without much problem. The place where it gets tricky is formal writing. \n\nTo be honest, this is rather reminiscent of something my dad would write, and he\u2019s a 50-year-old native English speaker making a six-figure salary. Compared to the general population, it\u2019s *not bad at all*! However, if you turned it into a high school English teacher, it would probably be about a C. The reality is that the average American adult probably would score about a C. \n\nRead through the suggestions I gave, but you don\u2019t have to expect yourself to memorize them all. You just need to keep practicing and getting feedback until you start to get an idea of what feels right. A big part of it is learning how to organize an essay rather than purely your English grammar. I\u2019ll get to that third essay when I can. Until then, I wish you the best!\n\nP.S. If it means anything to you, I actually found your first essay better-written. The grammar especially was better there.

Fair warning, it\u2019s going to be a wild ride. \n\nThis is a *Splatoon* fanfic (np if you haven\u2019t heard of the fandom, it\u2019s a video game) that takes place right after the end of the canon. \n\n/the context/\nThere are two separate humanoid species, the Inklings and the Octolings. About a hundred years ago, the Inklings won a war which allowed them to take over the land while the Octolings were forced underground. Agent Three\u2019s job is to fight the Octolings who are trying to encroach into Inkling territory and steal their power sources. At some point, he gets trapped underground for several months but escapes with the help of an Octoling later named Agent Eight. They make their way to the surface together. Eight isn\u2019t the only Octoling to have made it to the Surface, though; plenty of others have arrived before him and blend in peaceably with the Inklings, who for the most part can\u2019t tell them apart.\n\n/the plot/\nDespite the suspicion of Octolings ingrained in him by his (now former) job, Three decides to let Eight live with him. After some exposition and fluff, a celebrity whom Three and Eight are friends with is outed as an Octoling. A sort of Red-Scare/witch-hunt situation develops, where more Octolings are found out and blocked from employment, pushed out of housing, etc. The celebrity disappears, and our protagonists fear she\u2019s been captured. The government gets involved, offering bounties to round up Octolings, and we\u2019re progressing to genocidal levels (although the general population of Inklings are ignorant to what is actually going on). While Three has been able to protect Eight for a while because others fear him, eventually their apartment gets broken into and they have to flee. They\u2019re forced to go back underground and relive their worst memories in the hopes of getting some information about where their celebrity-friend is being held. It becomes clear that she\u2019s the key to stopping all of this. They establish contact with her, and with her help they\u2019re able to bring down the Inkling behind all this\u2014a reactionary veteran of the original war who\u2019s been using mind control techniques to maintain power. \n\nWhile there\u2019s a lot of action/adventure going on, it has a BIG focus on Three and Eight\u2019s forbidden romance between the two species. The current title (This Place We Called Home) is a reference to their wedding vows at the very end of the story. \n\nFirst Title: The Aftermath\n\nCurrent Title: This Place We Called Home\n\nIf you read through all this, thank you so much for putting up with my nonsense and giving your time! :P\n\nEdit: formatting", "created_utc": "1643690744.0", "edited": "1643690951.0", "id": "hv3e0o2", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_sgy0jh", "parent_id": "t3_sgy0jh", "score": "2", "subreddit": "FanFiction", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r5kb"}, {"author": "ikatako38", "body": "So true", "created_utc": "1643647220.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hv0fco3", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_sgnrkp", "parent_id": "t1_hv04lxb", "score": "2", "subreddit": "PoliticalHumor", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qm21"}, {"author": "ikatako38", "body": "This.

When I first got the idea I actually started out jotting down notes in a physical notebook, so I probably first started conceptualizing it around December 2020. I created a rough outline of the plot in about a month and just went ahead and started it. I know if I do too much planning before even starting, I\u2019ll lose interest with it, so I usually write the first couple chapters concurrently with some more planning to figure out what direction I\u2019m taking the rest of the story. I\u2018ve just started chapter 7 now, and I\u2019m still doing a decent amount of planning, but I think I have a good idea of where I\u2019m going with it at this point. By the time I finish a chapter, I like to know exactly where the next chapter will stop and end and what will happen, but I don\u2019t plan that out more than one or two chapters ahead of where I\u2019m writing. And of course every time I get an idea for a certain future scene or exchange in dialogue, I\u2019ll joy it down for later.

I probably should have picked some better sentences, but I couldn\u2019t pass it up when I saw these translations! Anyway, here goes:\n\n1. \u201cHow is it living in his apartment?\u201d (Literal: Is living at his apartment to your liking?)\n2. I like his place so much! And the clothes, and the *battles*, and the *Seanwiches* from the *Crust Bucket*. It\u2019s\u2026 so *fresh*! (Loanwords are in italics. And yes, this is in reference to r/Splatoon.)\n3. Homosexuality (a partial loan word).\n4. Marina, what\u2019s it like to be attracted to Inklings? (Literally, is it to your liking?)\n\nSo basically I\u2019m creating this as a partial conlang for a fanfiction I\u2019m writing. There are two distinct sentient species which each have their own language (Inkling and Octoling). Octoling (which I have translated here) is spoken secondary to Inkling. Thus, the nature of the language is really weird, because while I want Octoling to have some influence from Inkling (like the italicized loanwords), the entire story is pretty much a translation from Inkling into English. So in order to make any sort of sense to a reader, I have to make them look like they\u2019re loaned from English instead. Not to mention, the language is actually ideographic, but there\u2019s no way I\u2019ll be able to get new characters into my document, and I don\u2019t think anyone reading would really appreciate reading chicken scratch anyway. And I would also have to *make* the ideographic symbols, which really sounds like far too much work for a fanfiction I\u2019m not even posting yet. So whenever it\u2019s spoken aloud, I just use a romanization. \n\nAlso, the focus is more on the story than the language itself, so I\u2019ve taken the lazy route in some of my constructions, relying heavily on natural languages I already know. For example, the suffix *-ishimo* is a stand-in for Spanish \u201c-\u00edsimo,\u201d and *eto*, meaning \u201cand,\u201d is a combination of French \u201cet\u201d and Japanese \u201cto\u201d. The syllabary overall is basically the same as Japanese, but I\u2019ve started expanding and including a couple more sounds. (For example, the \u201cJ\u201d in *jishimomematsu*, meaning \u201capartment,\u201d is pronounced [[\u0292](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voiced_postalveolar_fricative)]. \u201cDj\u201d represents [d\u0292]. \n\nTL;DR: It\u2019s for a fanfiction, but don\u2019t worry about it. Just laugh at the funny translations. :)\n\nEdit: spelling", "created_utc": "1642689163.0", "edited": "1642689849.0", "id": "htgmwld", "is_submitter": "True", "link_id": "t3_s8izgn", "parent_id": "t1_htgeqgw", "score": "3", "subreddit": "conlangs", "subreddit_id": "t5_2red7"}, {"author": "ikatako38", "body": "New to the community and didn\u2019t read the flair rules.

The most important thing to keep in mind is that, while double negatives exist in English, they work differently than double negatives in other languages. For example, the Spanish sentence:\n\n\u201cNo quiero ir a ning\u00fan sitio.\u201d\n\nThe equivalent expression in English would be \u201cI do not want to go anywhere.\u201d\n\nLiterally, \u201cning\u00fan sitio\u201d means \u201cnowhere,\u201d but if we say the sentence \u201cI do not want to go nowhere,\u201d this actually implies that I DO want to go somewhere (although in a more convoluted way).\n\nIn French, double negation is actually required to be grammatically correct:\n\n\u201cJe ne veux pas aller \u00e0 aucun lieu.\u201d\n\nWhere \u201cne\u201d is the negation marker and \u201caucun lieu\u201d means \u201cnowhere.\u201d\n\nIn both the Spanish and French sentences, the sentence remains negative, but when we apply a double negative to an English sentence, it actually turns positive! (In most cases.) Thus, depending on the language you\u2019re translating from, using a double negative may result in the opposite meaning of what you intended. This is probably why your teacher said it\u2019s best to avoid them. \n\nWhile English double negatives can always be more simply expressed as a positive, native English speakers do use them, and they do serve a purpose (as some other comments have mentioned). Perhaps a prime example to compare:\n\n\u201cEnglish speakers use double negatives.\u201d\n\n\u201cEnglish speakers don\u2019t NOT use double negatives.\u201d\n\nWhile the first sentence is a normal declaration of fact, the second sentence expresses hesitancy on the speaker\u2019s part, either because they are unsure about the correctness of their statement or because they are acknowledging that the statement is only partially true.

Like nothing I or anyone else can do will be able to change the course of this pandemic. So now we just sit here approaching 2022, no better than we were before but now just numb to the numbers.

The opposite of a \u201ctrans man\u201d is a \u201ccis man,\u201d namely one who was assigned male at birth (AMAB).\n\nTaken at face value, I agree that the meaning is indeed ambiguous. Upon further contemplation, you might be able to presume that people who identify as women would not want to call themselves \u201ctrans men,\u201d since they don\u2019t identify as men.

Of course, the best way to combat this misinformation is to simply explain so people understand! OP seems to be confounding trans people with crossdressers or drag artists. A crossdresser is a person who habitually dresses in clothing, makeup, and accessories typically associated with the opposite gender. A drag artist does this as a performance and typically crossdresses  exclusively on stage. Both crossdressers and drag artists usually identify with their sex assigned at birth (or, at least, not the gender they\u2019re dressing as). Once the clothes come off or the show is over, they go back to being their actual gender. On the other hand, trans people live in their identified gender full-time and consider themselves a member of that gender. \n\nI\u2019m trying to take a more semantic approach here to reduce the emotions involved.

Guessing it\u2019s different depending on the country. \n\nIn Japanese, on the other hand, there are several layers of formality. For example, there are just about infinite second-person pronouns, each with highly-specific uses:\n\n\u3042\u306a\u305f (Anata) - somewhat formal but mostly just used by women to their spouses\n\n\u3042\u3093\u305f (Anta) - contraction of anata, overly familiar, can be quite rude depending on the context\n\n\u541b (Kimi) - can be used toward males in a lower position that you in a hierarchy, i.e. an employee. Has slight undertones of \u201cI\u2019m better than you.\u201d\n\n\u304a\u524d (Omae) - often used when scolding children, implies the speaker is far superior in the social hierarchy to the listener. However, it can be used by people in positions of power, such as a boss, without being rude. \n\n\u624b\u3081\u3048 (Temee) - you\u2019re basically cursing the other person out. \n\nNotice that there is no instance of a general-use pronoun. In most context, you just have to bend the sentence around to not use any pronoun at all. On top of this, many words important to Japnese culture (such as tea, daytime, meals, and bathtubs apparently) need an honorific prefix regardless of the formality setting, and verbs inflect for formality as well. The worst part is, being extra formal can often be just as rude as using an overly informal form.

I\u2019d say it\u2019s by far the easiest language to pronounce and spell; you could throw pretty much any word in the Spanish dictionary at me and I\u2019d know how to pronounce it with just a glance.

[How To Pronounce the French R](https://www.frenchtoday.com/blog/french-pronunciation/r/)\n\nNow, let\u2019s take your \u201cEurope\u201d example and take it in chunks:\n\nEu - This sounds like a sound between \u201cEh\u2026\u201d and \u201cUh\u2026\u201d It sort of sounds like a groaning noise, tbh. Notice how the \u201cEh\u2026\u201d is farther forward in your mouth, and the \u201cUh\u2026\u201d is further back. Try for something in between. Also, I\u2019m pretty sure you round your lips. The \u201ceu\u201d combination is basically always pronounced the same way whenever you see it.\n\nR - Try out that French R sound you just learned! It\u2019s alright if you can\u2019t get it perfect; it\u2019s pretty hard to hear when spoken out loud, anyway. \n\nO - It\u2019s not a perfectly clean \u201co\u201d sound\u2014in fact, it\u2019s a little closer to the way you would pronounce the O in the English word \u201cEurope.\u201d Vowels will often sound slightly different in a vowel-consonant-e pattern. Compare the French words \u201cOr\u201d and \u201cHomme.\u201d (Go ahead, type them into Google Translate and hit the speaker button!) In \u201cor,\u201d you can hear a very distinct \u201coh,\u201d whereas the word \u201chomme\u201d sounds more like \u201cum.\u201d\n\nPE - Just a \u201cP\u201d sound! Of course, the \u201cE\u201d will be silent. (Granted, you may hear it pronounced faintly as a sound like the E in \u201cpetition.\u201d Final Es are more likely to be pronounced in certain dialects, in poetry, or before another of the same consonant, in this case a P.)\n\nI\u2019m not a language expert, just another Duolingo learner like you, so please make corrections if you see any!\n\nAlso, a final note: Duolingo\u2019s voice recognition is often imperfect, so don\u2019t beat yourself up over missing some of the words. For example, any number above about \u201cdeux\u201d will be rejected every time. I read a comment that someone recorded the given audio and played it back into the mic, still rejected. So don\u2019t let Duo\u2019s questionable hearing bring you down! My best suggestion in general is to just keep on listening to the language, looking for patterns in the spelling and prononciation.
