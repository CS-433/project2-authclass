I'm glad that companies like OkCupid publish these statistics as it gives us the chance to measure progress. However, unfortunately a lot of the media interpretation can be very sensationalist and counterproductive.\n\nLooking at the data here the preference of Asian men for black women varied wildly from 16% to 30% below the average between 2009 and 2014, suggesting a small sample size. Let's say for convenience that it's approx 20%.\n\nSo when you get behind the severity of the headline \"all non-black men were less likely to start conversations with black women\". This means for every 5 messages the average woman is receiving from Asian men, the average black woman is receiving 4. There could be a whole host of reasons for this. Some may be related due to perceived attractiveness, but some could be to do with 1st language preferences, family expectations, or even just exposure due to geographic area.\n\nThere are other considerations too. People may have age bands and distance bands in their search. Younger users ( I.e. those you may match as a 23 yr old) may be more open than the average user. In addition, if people use distance bands to choose who is worth messaging, then the data may be further skewed. E.g. an Asian user in San Francisco is likely to message fewer black women than the national average even if he does not discriminate against them, as black people only make up 5% of the population of that city. Likewise a black woman in Milwaukee will not recieve messages from Asian men at a percentage that would be reflective of the national average.\n\nOf course there are considerations the other way too. Users of an online dating app are more likely to be liberal than conservative. Ecspecially those from ethnic backgrounds that are more conservative. However, I hope some of what I say can convince you that these stats reflect trends in society, and not hard-and-fast rules that you should allow to discourage you from approaching people or accepting their advances.", "created_utc": "1578747170.0", "edited": "False", "id": "fdvglkz", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_en6nu7", "parent_id": "t3_en6nu7", "score": "16", "subreddit": "interracialdating", "subreddit_id": "t5_2x0dk"}, {"author": "HrOlympios", "body": "I.e.
