This does not mean that I am planning to do something specific , but that I am considering different options and this is one option I am not sure about - which is why I asked reddit. In more practical matters, I could probably have waited with this question until I got to know the new professor, but I thought thinking about my options and doing something can exist separately. \n\nBecause I have received such stark backlash which I did not expect, I feel like I have to defend myself a bit. I am actually a bit shocked by the responses I got here, as they are pretty serious in nature. \n\nI have already worked with my supervisor for about nine months. In that time, I tried to plan regular meetings about my progress (every month or so). However, in that time, my supervisor did not read my status updates/inspect my progress or showed much interest in that, which was apparent in the few meetings we had. Many times, planned meetings were cancelled because of organizational issues and despite me asking to reschedule instead of cancelling. In total, we met about 6h in the 9 months. Additionally, I am friends with a TA at her chair and two flatmates of mine were student assistants for her for two years (incl during the timeframe I was supervised by her) and both agreed with my assessment regarding us working together. And lastly, she herself made comments about my research interest not really being her cup of tea and that she might not be of much help because that and because of her many other duties as a professor. So my assumptions here are not baseless. Still, I feel like I need to stress that I raised a hypothetical question here and did not act yet but merely consider my options.\nMaybe I could have communicated these issues more clearly? \n\nI feel it's important to point out that in my culture flirting is not seen as a necessarily sexual behavior. You make a similar differentiation, too. But then in your last sentence you leave this important difference out and accuse me of something very grave which I did not do. I see that it might come off weird if one considers it a sexual issue, which I implicitly did not and explicitly do not.\nAdditionally, my comparison is about flirting and the hermeneutics of it and not our relationship. In my courses on cultural studies,  flirting was discussed as a specific way to communicate which also fulfills a specific function in a social and cultural setting, namely preventing to lose face, to the detriment of clarity in communication.  My statement was supposed to illustrate the observation of how in a professional and academic environment, where the setting and the relationship is opposite to the social and cultural setting of flirting, how in this situation, the intended result is similarly opposite, while the communication however might follow a similar structure and be similarly unclear. \n\nAll in all, I hope that it is now clearer why I thought that I considered her views and that I am not comparing our relationship to a sexual one. \n\nNonetheless, it is right that I have not yet asked her about her opinion and have just assumed what she might think. Clearly, this is a train of thought I need to work on, even though I alway planned on asking her about her opinion on the matter. It appears my thought process and my actions are not in harmony or my capacity to write comprehensible is lacking, or both. \nThis became clear to me when I saw that you said \"I think you need to sit down with your supervisor and have a conversation about how things are going. Perhaps you could suggest collaborating with this new PI or co-supervision now that she's not around?\" - which was basically my default strategy (sitting down with her I mean) and one of the other options I considered (I have discussed the idea of co-supervision with an academic coach and with fellow students) and which I considered more appropriate than what I presented here.

So I want to reiterate on why I explicitly differentiated between theory-focussed and \"real life events\" literature:\n\nI study politics where we are often tasked with using new noticeable events to polish existing theories or create new ones to enable predictions. In that nature it is often not about finding arguments or past events to verify hypotheses, but about using new/recent events to do that. As is the nature of academia, peer-reviewed literature on recent issues is scarce. So in the pension example it would be something like \"existing literature shows these changes in pension policy have led to longer life-expectancy, but ~~no one has asked if seniors stay healthy for those extra years~~ the 2022 report of the German Federal Ministry of Labour and Social Affair (has data that) seems to contradict that.\"\n\nIn this case, I can almost guarantee that no journal is fast enough to already publish something that would contextualize this report. If that were the case, I could, for example, review the last two years of labor policy in Germany and whether or not that might have had an impact. I could not rely on the academic literature to do that.\n\nAt least that's how I think it is and how I felt about it when I read your answer :)\n\nAnd I want to mention that even in this case, you would've helped me immensely already: I would ask \"what sort of information would prove or disprove my hypothesis?\"; I would probably check back with my prof for a little help in direction regarding methodology and/or read a guide; and last but not least, I would be sure to invest time and energy in my reasoning as much as necessary to not waste it in collecting data.

It is an attempt to do what it was actually invented to do away with.\n\nAfaik, programs like Obsidian and Roam are called second brain software or something like that. After months of trying different systems of tags, index based tables and whatnot, I had my breakthrough with Obsidian when I looked at it like this:\nWhen my brain memorizes a thought, every attribute, every category, every relationship or part of it is just another thought. example: If I think about my room's door, I associate it with (the #material) wood, with (the #colour) brown, with (the #concept of) opening and closing and that it is a part of every #interior. And to make it more impressive, in the moment of thinking that, my brain already knows that all of these are #words, part of the English #language and thereby open to #linguistic analysis. It should be clear by now that each tag is a justified tag in a sense of grouping. But at the same time, it is blatantly clear that all of these very different kind of elements my brain has on standby are saved in the same format. Because everything can be the attribute of something and every attribute can have attributes of its own. Hence, sorting and grouping is unlimited in our brains. Limitations of tags, folders, cupboards, room's etc do not limit our brains, they are just the result *of saving human thought in physical space*. \n\nThe marvelous thing is that our brain does *not sort* anything, it doesn't need to. Which is quite frankly a amazing feat. It just is capable of presenting all known associations to each thought on demand, it doesn't need to \"go somewhere and fetch the thought\", it just links everything. \n\nThis is completely different to the standard of opening  folders and subfolders to get a file that you know relates to what you are doing. \n\nSo don't use tags because one day sooner rather than later the tag might be the subject of a note. In addition, you are putting a physical limitation on the concept that you are tagging by designating it the sole dimension \"#tag\".\n\nThank you for coming to TED talk; obligatory sorry for the wall of text.", "created_utc": "1630750876.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hbjxzqu", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_phav02", "parent_id": "t1_hbjg6io", "score": "3", "subreddit": "ObsidianMD", "subreddit_id": "t5_2mz3dr"}, {"author": "easeandchance", "body": "I hope I am not invoking an existential question: What about things you *are doing at the moment*? \n\nI tried using almost the same tags but failed thru the question of whether or not I use it as \n\n#todo#done\n\n i.e. hierarchical tags or just plain singular tags.\n\nCould you please elaborate on whether or not every note you write has such a tag or not, if you can?", "created_utc": "1630708704.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hbi3xch", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_phav02", "parent_id": "t1_hbhbsof", "score": "2", "subreddit": "ObsidianMD", "subreddit_id": "t5_2mz3dr"}, {"author": "easeandchance", "body": "I remember when some new friends I made brought me to a club that turned out to be a gay club.\nFrom the moment the nice and understanding bouncer let us in to the moment I went home there was something ever so slightly different about the women there, but I couldn't put my finger on it.

Icarus' father warns him to not fly close to the sun, i.e. too high. Of course, Icarus later on flies to high, the wax melts, and he falls to his death.While the mission name is still not really fitting, as the player SHOOTS DOWN the drone instead of it behaving somewhat irrationally, the title is still much better than the average \"sounds cool and relates to 10% of the quest\" title.

To quote: \"Sorry for the long comment, but your post inspired me to talk about this topic!\"\n\nI immediately thought of the typical \"classes\" in games. they are one archetype of how you can give the player an array of possibilities on how to play, so that she has the freedom to decide when to do what, while all of these options must somehow be viable to the player.\n\nExample Overwatch:\n Everyone has abilities, all abilities have viable use cases, the use cases happen in every game, and so *overall* the different setups equal each other out - however, what you fittingly named the \"moment-to-moment gameplay\" isn't balanced at all times. A tank is gonna crush a healer in 1v1 and so forth\n\nSimilar issues arise in strategy games. \n\nI disagree with the notion that asymmetrical multiplayer is more difficult to design, as one of their unique aspects is that you *only have to design gameplay-possibilities that are balanced in a specific pre-determined constellation*. \nIn other words: The DbD-Developers don't have to think about how balanced a murderer vs murderer match would be. Which is also a reason why the gameplay diversity is limited per the logic of the game.\n\nWhat do you think about that?\n\n\n\nLess thought out and more based on my gut I just think that we don't really want asymmetrical multiplayer games. We want multiplayer games with much more freedom/diversity of gameplay. Damage dealer vs Tank vs healer is now as old as is cavalry beats archery beats infantry beats cavalry etc But from a design perspective and per definition we don't want asymmetrical balance.\n\nackchyually, we want \"new classes\" like \"murderer\" and \"survivor\" that allow us to experience new gameplay. And as the first action of innovation tends to be mixing up what you already have, seemingly asymmetrical multiplayer came up naturally. Take known but not yet combined gameplay like a first person stealth game and a third person shooter and you have the origin story of \"spies vs mercs\" in splinter cell.
