Estrone is sort of a 'storage' form of estrogen in the body - it doesn't really get metabolized, nor does it interact with estrogen receptors. Within tissues where estrogen is important (such as breast tissue), an abundance of a protein known as HSD17B1 can be found. HSD17B1 increases the local concentration of estradiol, which enhances its effects - good and bad (such as cancer risk).\n\nMany experimental studies were done to figure out how it works, but they fail to agree upon a singular mechanism - three methods compete as possibilities. Learning how an enzyme catalyzes a chemical conversion can be helpful in designing drugs that inhibit these processes, or at least modifying hormone supplements for women experiencing PMS to reduce associated cancer risk. Using computer studies, the motions of molecules were explored however there is a lack of any research that describes the electrons themselves.\n\nStudying molecule motion is not easy - we are trying to evolve a quantum system in time with lots of moving parts. Still, we can afford to approximate all that quantum nonsense with classical trickery - we know the \"ideal\" shape, length and whatnot of how atoms align with each other in specific environments and thus create a function which introduces energy when things deviate (and then we try to minimize this energy). \n\nNow, electrons are NOT possible to be approximated like this. They need to be given a proper quantum mechanical treatment, however the schroedinger equation only has an easy and exact solution for the hydrogen atom, and hydrogen-like ions (like carbon with just 1 electron). For other atoms, we need to make approximations. We make these approximations by calculating the electron wavefunction one by one for carbon's 1s1, 1s2, 2s1, 2s2, 2p1, 2p2 electrons (we call these atomic orbitals), then we add all of them up and calculate the energy. Then, we multiply each electron's contribution by a different coefficient, and vary these coefficients until the energy becomes small enough. For molecules, (like CH4) we do the same, but rather than fit the wavefunctions to a single atom, we fit them to the whole molecule.\n\nCalculating the energy of these electron wavefunctions is not easy. We need to calculate the potential energy between the electron and the nucleus (or nuclei in molecules). We need to calculate the kinetic energy from the electron whizzing around said nucleus. We can simplify the electron-nucleus potential by saying the nucleus is (compared to the tiny and super fast electron) 'immobile'. We cannot do the same for electron-electron potentials. Each electron-electron interaction influences the position of both actively. This is borderline impossible to calculate barring some mathematical miracle.\n\nThus, a lot of approximations were born to represent this electron-electron interaction. The simplest of them is the \"Self-Consistent Field\" method, also known as Hartree-Fock Method. Here, we say all but 1 electron is frozen in time and space, forming a 'force-field' of sorts. We allow this forcefield to act on the singular mobile electron, and we try to find a location that minimizes its potential energy. Then, we place it into this frozen forcefield and bring out the next electron. We repeat this, iterating over all electrons until we got a new set of coefficients for each one-electron wavefunction (Atomic Orbital). We then start over from scratch, and compare the total electronic energy of our 2 states - if the difference is smaller than a arbitrary treshold, we go and say \"we found the molecular wavefunction\" (by rule, we can never reach the real electronic energy, but we can approach it from above. We know that as long as energy gets lower, we are getting closer to reality - this is the variational principle).\n\nI'm using a more complicated approximation - called a \"meta-GGA hybrid functional\" - namely: M06-2X. The simplest way to describe this is that I'm using *functionals* that describe electron density, rather than wavefunctions. This reduces the complexity by limiting the coordinates I need to care about. However, I combine this with the above self-consistent field method, and calculate the final electron-electron interaction as 54% energy contribution from 'exact hartree exchange' and the rest using parameterized, empirically fitted functionals. \n\nNow, all of this is super complicated maths. Like, very, very complicated. We're talking about solving thousands of integrals for just one cycle of iterating these electrons at just 80 atoms. Even for a supercomputer, it'd take far too long for all the 5000 atoms of a protein. So, we cheat. We look back at the force-field methods from earlier and use them to calculate the whole protein (called the real system). Then, I cut out the layer I care about - where electrons become important due to bond formation and motions and all. I cap the ends of this slice with hydrogens so there are no dangling chemical bonds. I then calculate this new slice (called the model system) using both a forcefield and quantum chemical method. Then I make the assumption that the energy is the sum of the real system done with forcefields, and that of the model system done with quantum mechanics. Because I double-counted the model system (I did not cut it out from the real system when counting it), I subtract the energy of the model system calculated with a forcefield.\n\nUsing the above, I have obtained the ONIOM energy of the HSD17B1 complexed with estradiol and nicotine adenine dinuceotide triphosphate (NADPH). However, the geometry of it all is wrong - I need to find a real geometry!\n\nSo, I calculate the forces acting on the real system (but freeze the model region) by simply asking \"How would I change bond distances, angles, dihedral angles so that the energy would be lower?\" - then adjust all of these until I find a point where the 'force' twisting, pulling and whatnot these atoms becomes either 0, or something very close. \n\nOnce this is done, I repeat the same for the quantum chemical layer (albeit with much more expensive calculations and more fancy algorithms to try and make sure I'm moving towards the lowest energy ground state geometry).\n\nI move back and forth for real and model system optimizations until the net force becomes 0. Then, I analytically calculate the force rather than do cheap approximations. If I get no imaginary frequencies, I found the real existing molecule shape!\n\nThen, how do I explore the actual chemical reaction? I hardcode a bit of motion. I say \"take hydrogen 3245 (random number) and move it in this direction (towards oxygen 2556) by 0.05 \u00c5.\" and freeze this specific coordinate (H-O bond length). then, optimize the geometry around this now frozen bond length.\" I repeat this statement like 20-30 times and examine the energy graph. This graph should have a peak - this is the transition state.\n\nI take the peak of this graph and tell my program to calculate it using a much more sophisticated method (in my case: I'm using more atomic orbitals than I did for the 'coordinate scan', because the more orbitals you use the more accurate your calculation. Although carbon only has 6 electrons that go up to 2p2, I include 3D and even 4F electron orbitals as possibilities for the electron to move to because it more accurately describes where electrons may go when polaized or within hydrogen bonds). \n\nFinally, after obtaining all transition states, all ground states - and their thermally-corrected energies... I try to find the reaction path along the 3 experimentally proposed ones that occurs the fastest.\n\nMost of the above is done by me using a graphical interface and inputting some commands to a computer. I don't actually need to compute anything except for the reaction rates with the final energies. The challenge is in finding the right size of model system, the right geometry for initial calculations, the right forcefield parameters, the right level of theory for quantum chemical approximations and the right set of atomic orbitals that are small enough to be calculated quickly, but accurate enough to be chemically meaningful. \n\nBeen working 1 year at this for now.", "created_utc": "1667034268.0", "edited": "False", "id": "iu87dlq", "is_submitter": "True", "link_id": "t3_yfnotf", "parent_id": "t1_iu7cjtc", "score": "1", "subreddit": "AutismInWomen", "subreddit_id": "t5_3yx96k"}, {"author": "Hoihe", "body": "Amugy...\n\nElvileg lmbt let nem az alkotmany ellen tesz?\n\nMegvaltoztattak hogy mi a kapcsolat illetve eltitottak a transznemu embereket a jogi es egessegugyiatastol", "created_utc": "1667024942.0", "edited": "False", "id": "iu7wvmx", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_yfl827", "parent_id": "t1_iu4o54o", "score": "1", "subreddit": "hungary", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qzzt"}, {"author": "Hoihe", "body": "Hungary (unfortunately) still exists and keeps licking russian soles.", "created_utc": "1667023466.0", "edited": "False", "id": "iu7v44v", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_yg77l6", "parent_id": "t1_iu7toa5", "score": "-1", "subreddit": "YouShouldKnow", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r94o"}, {"author": "Hoihe", "body": "Is p commonly used in europe/ukraine these days", "created_utc": "1667023419.0", "edited": "False", "id": "iu7v21y", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_yg77l6", "parent_id": "t1_iu7eatb", "score": "-5", "subreddit": "YouShouldKnow", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r94o"}, {"author": "Hoihe", "body": "The purpose of politics is social problems.\n\nEconomics are the tool which oppressive conformists use to enforce their social views.\n\nRepublicans dont oppose welfare or social safety nets because of thr evonomy.\n\nThey oppose them because they liberate people from the yoke of family, church, corporation and 'charitable organizations'.\n\nIn countries with free education, healthcare and even housing aid - people can freely survive schisms with their family without any consequences.

It is a complex term which we can split into 2 simpler constituents that also have the word, \"gender\" within them complicating things.\n\nLet's start with **constituent A - Social Gender Identity.** Social Gender is what feminism refers to when its proponents say, \"Gender is a social construct!\" (which i agree with). \n\nSocial gender is something arbitrary that society decided to impose upon its members based on their genitalia, sexual phenotype and/or sexual orientation.\n\nWithin social gender we can find the concepts of dress codes, acceptable emotional expressions, behaviour policing, jobs you are (not) allowed to do, your rights and duties and so forth. (Almost) All of this is arbtirary, and if you go to another culture - may change completely. Sometimes you don't even need to go far, just move from a rural village to the capital to experience a drastic change in what it means to be a woman (in my village, people consider being a scientist a male job and look at women weird for going to univ rather than having children, whereas my university in Hungary's capital is full of scholarships encouraging women to get into science).\n\nNow, Autistic people are often described in pop science articles as \"lacking\" an innate understanding of social constructs, which i can sorta identify with! Thus, if we accept this as true - then it makes sense that for those of us whose brains are wired differently, the whole arbitrary idea of social gender with all its unjustified and random rules feel wrong, alien and \"hard to understand.\"\n\nNow, this could mean autistic people have a large number of non-binary/agender individuals. Or it could just make the community gender non-conforming. The only good thing about social gender - because of how utterly random and arbitrary it is - self ID is not only valid: it's encouraged! As such, I self ID as \"Gender non-conforming woman (by standards of rural Hungary)\" It's something of a tongue-in-cheek self ID for me, as I am tired of people telling me I can't be a woman if I like sword fighting and science and maths.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut there's another component to gender I havn't mentioned yet, and something as a neuroscientist may find interesting! \nThe 2 most up to date papers I base this upon:  \nhttps://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-17352-8  (2017)  \nhttps://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-80687-2  (2021)  \n\nThere's more than these two, but these two in particular approached the question by controlling for sexual orientation and ignored social biases like maths skills or language skills. Or rather: They controlled for them. \n\nControlling for all that, these papers found that the brains of transgender individuals differed from those of cisgender individuals. *For sake of not being an unwilling advocate for transmedicalists: This paper focuses on those transgender individuals with \"Physical dysphoria\", and those trans people who are entirely based on the social gender are completely valid.* With that out of the way: \n\nThe 2017 paper found that transgender people show differences in brain regions corresponding to how the individual perceives their own body, regions that create a sense of \"Ownership\" over one's own body. The 2021 paper found that if a transgender person starts to medically transition using hormone replacement therapy, these differences reduce. Taking karyotpe-approrpiate (so estrogen for FTM, testosterone for MTF) did NOT provide improvements, in fact cisgender people taking hormones experienced neural degradation. \n\nThe 2021 paper proposed 2 mechanisms (but it was out of scope to decide which is the real one, but they admitted it could be both) as such:  \n**Mechanism 1:**    \nCross-sex hormones directly interact with neural structures, strengthening the weakened connections.  \n**Mechanism 2:**    \nBy having the body look more like, AND function more like the brain expects it to - these weakened structures strengthen in kind of a feedback loop mumbo jumbo.\n\n\nAs such, we arrive to **Constituent B - Internal Gender Identity/Neural Gender**. Neural Gender is thus defined: A particular sexual phenotype (either binary male or female, or in between) that the brain expects the body to possess after puberty finishes. This includes gonads, endocrine levels and primary & secondary sex characteristics. Any deviation from what the brain expects creates either a direct sense of distress, or a dull pain that is only recognized once eased (in other words: dysphoria). \n\nChances are, if you do not feel any acute sense of distress in regards to your sexual characteristics, and the idea of altering them (including your hormonal make up) does not make you feel you would experience an improvement of mental health, then your neural gender is aligned with your sexual phenotype. \n\nThis does NOT mean you cannot be trans. It just means that if you do not particularly feel attached to the social gender that is \"Woman\" in western (post)-Christian society, it does not mean you are not allowed to call yourself a woman.\n\n\n\nTo be transgender, one of the following must be true:\nYour Social Gender Identity differs from what society assigns to your sexual phenotype & sexual orientation   \n**INCLUSIVE OR**  \nYour Internal Gender Identity differs at least in one component (not necessarily ALL components - you are totally valid if you only feel dysphoric due to hormonal stuff and don't want beard or whatever) from the sexual phenotype your body expressed through puberty.\n\n\n\nPersonally, I have a fairly strong overlap of my internal gender identity's expectations with that of the typical human female sexual phenotype, and as such I am pursuing medical transition to achieve that. As a consequence, I identify as a woman.\n\nHowever, I also lack a particularly strong attachment towards any particular social gender identity, bar a few specifics (name, address, culturally influenced idea of how a woman must look like [Long hair, smooth skin under the neck]). I still identify as a woman though, as I place more weight (Personally) on my internal gender identity && I am a feminist, so I reject many of the things my country assigns to women in terms of duties and behaviour and whatnot.\n\n\n\n\n\nHope it helps!", "created_utc": "1666944188.0", "edited": "False", "id": "iu3i4qw", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_yf2rc0", "parent_id": "t3_yf2rc0", "score": "8", "subreddit": "ask_transgender", "subreddit_id": "t5_31hoq"}, {"author": "Hoihe", "body": "Phoron is a miracle material.\n\nIt has a atomic number far above what is stable.\n\nThis is enabled by presence of Alden-Sarasprova particles replacing some of the neutrons. Alden-Sarasprova particles bend spacetime just so that the Strong Nuclear force remains dominant over the electromagnetic repulsion caused by the large amount of protons and neutrons. (as a note - Humanity discovered AS particles before phoron, and can produce them artifically using particle accelerators. Phoron is simply a far more convenient source which used to be abundantly found in the Oort cloud due to distant asteroids from red dwarves. Since reaching interstellar status, humanity came to rely on extraction operations around gas giants like in the Nyx system such as Erebus which capture solar wind from the star containing said phoron)\n\nHigh intensity near-UV light (as produced by emitters) interacts with the Alden-Sarasprova particle, causing them to stop existing simultenously in Realspace and Bluespace. In this collapse, the AS particle brings with it part of Realspace into bluespace, causing the Phoron to split into multiple carbon and oxygen atoms and alpha, beta and gamma radiation. \n\nThis quality of phoron is used to enable Faster than light travel by applying sufficient intensity light to a large enough concentration that \"rips\" the spaceship out of realspace into bluespace, where distances are significantly shorter and time doesn't flow the same way as in \"reality\".\n\nIt is also possible to shape this \"rip\" in reality to form wormholes, or 'stable' gates connecting distant parts of space.\n\nFor energy generation, phoron is useful because it releases a lot of energy - enough to power a large cruiser and more while only needing about 10 M^3 space with minimal infrastructure (assuming 1 tile is 1x1x2.5).\n\nAs a medical reagent, phoron's use is primarily as a way to create a iron-phoron compound that can complex molecular oxygen. This complex is very stable outside of blood plasma, but within blood plasma it is less stable than haemoglobin (while binding CO2 and CO readily). This enables it to be used to nearly enable people to live in the vacuum of space (provided pressure is accounted for to avoid popped lungs and other injuries from harsh vacuum) (Dexalin and Dexalin Plus)\n\nFor Phoron's use to create clonexadone and cryoxadone, I am not certain of the lore.

It is a complex term which we can split into 2 simpler constituents that also have the word, \"gender\" within them complicating things.\n\nLet's start with **constituent A - Social Gender Identity.** Social Gender is what feminism refers to when its proponents say, \"Gender is a social construct!\" (which i agree with). \n\nSocial gender is something arbitrary that society decided to impose upon its members based on their genitalia, sexual phenotype and/or sexual orientation.\n\nWithin social gender we can find the concepts of dress codes, acceptable emotional expressions, behaviour policing, jobs you are (not) allowed to do, your rights and duties and so forth. (Almost) All of this is arbtirary, and if you go to another culture - may change completely. Sometimes you don't even need to go far, just move from a rural village to the capital to experience a drastic change in what it means to be a woman (in my village, people consider being a scientist a male job and look at women weird for going to univ rather than having children, whereas my university in Hungary's capital is full of scholarships encouraging women to get into science).\n\nNow, Autistic people are often described in pop science articles as \"lacking\" an innate understanding of social constructs, which i can sorta identify with! Thus, if we accept this as true - then it makes sense that for those of us whose brains are wired differently, the whole arbitrary idea of social gender with all its unjustified and random rules feel wrong, alien and \"hard to understand.\"\n\nNow, this could mean autistic people have a large number of non-binary/agender individuals. Or it could just make the community gender non-conforming. The only good thing about social gender - because of how utterly random and arbitrary it is - self ID is not only valid: it's encouraged! As such, I self ID as \"Gender non-conforming woman (by standards of rural Hungary)\" It's something of a tongue-in-cheek self ID for me, as I am tired of people telling me I can't be a woman if I like sword fighting and science and maths.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut there's another component to gender I havn't mentioned yet, and something as a neuroscientist may find interesting! \nThe 2 most up to date papers I base this upon:  \nhttps://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-17352-8  (2017)  \nhttps://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-80687-2  (2021)  \n\nThere's more than these two, but these two in particular approached the question by controlling for sexual orientation and ignored social biases like maths skills or language skills. Or rather: They controlled for them. \n\nControlling for all that, these papers found that the brains of transgender individuals differed from those of cisgender individuals. *For sake of not being an unwilling advocate for transmedicalists: This paper focuses on those transgender individuals with \"Physical dysphoria\", and those trans people who are entirely based on the social gender are completely valid.* With that out of the way: \n\nThe 2017 paper found that transgender people show differences in brain regions corresponding to how the individual perceives their own body, regions that create a sense of \"Ownership\" over one's own body. The 2021 paper found that if a transgender person starts to medically transition using hormone replacement therapy, these differences reduce. Taking karyotpe-approrpiate (so estrogen for FTM, testosterone for MTF) did NOT provide improvements, in fact cisgender people taking hormones experienced neural degradation. \n\nThe 2021 paper proposed 2 mechanisms (but it was out of scope to decide which is the real one, but they admitted it could be both) as such:  \n**Mechanism 1:**    \nCross-sex hormones directly interact with neural structures, strengthening the weakened connections.  \n**Mechanism 2:**    \nBy having the body look more like, AND function more like the brain expects it to - these weakened structures strengthen in kind of a feedback loop mumbo jumbo.\n\n\nAs such, we arrive to **Constituent B - Internal Gender Identity/Neural Gender**. Neural Gender is thus defined: A particular sexual phenotype (either binary male or female, or in between) that the brain expects the body to possess after puberty finishes. This includes gonads, endocrine levels and primary & secondary sex characteristics. Any deviation from what the brain expects creates either a direct sense of distress, or a dull pain that is only recognized once eased (in other words: dysphoria). \n\nChances are, if you do not feel any acute sense of distress in regards to your sexual characteristics, and the idea of altering them (including your hormonal make up) does not make you feel you would experience an improvement of mental health, then your neural gender is aligned with your sexual phenotype. \n\nThis does NOT mean you cannot be trans. It just means that if you do not particularly feel attached to the social gender that is \"Woman\" in western (post)-Christian society, it does not mean you are not allowed to call yourself a woman.\n\n\n\nTo be transgender, one of the following must be true:\nYour Social Gender Identity differs from what society assigns to your sexual phenotype & sexual orientation   \n**INCLUSIVE OR**  \nYour Internal Gender Identity differs at least in one component (not necessarily ALL components - you are totally valid if you only feel dysphoric due to hormonal stuff and don't want beard or whatever) from the sexual phenotype your body expressed through puberty.\n\n\n\nPersonally, I have a fairly strong overlap of my internal gender identity's expectations with that of the typical human female sexual phenotype, and as such I am pursuing medical transition to achieve that. As a consequence, I identify as a woman.\n\nHowever, I also lack a particularly strong attachment towards any particular social gender identity, bar a few specifics (name, address, culturally influenced idea of how a woman must look like [Long hair, smooth skin under the neck]). I still identify as a woman though, as I place more weight (Personally) on my internal gender identity && I am a feminist, so I reject many of the things my country assigns to women in terms of duties and behaviour and whatnot.\n\n\n\n\n\nHope it helps!", "created_utc": "1666728179.0", "edited": "False", "id": "itrlpif", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_yd4i7g", "parent_id": "t3_yd4i7g", "score": "2", "subreddit": "asktransgender", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r4b9"}, {"author": "Hoihe", "body": "One interesting thing I noticed is...\n\nMy mother listens to faith healing, quantum healing, collects crystals and \"wave genetics.\" She believes in these.\n\nWhen Covid struck, they all swapped over to being anti-vax, albeit open to Sinovac.\n\nWhen Russia attacked Ukraine, they all immediately changed tune to be heavily anti-NATO, anti-EU, anti Ukraine and pro-Russia.\n\nPretty much all of the anti-covid facebook groups' owners flipped overnight. \n\nHungarian Facebook is practically dominated by pro-Russia/Anti-NATO things in places that used to be 'harmless' conspiracy theories or faith healing stuff.", "created_utc": "1666710112.0", "edited": "False", "id": "itqay0g", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_yd3eui", "parent_id": "t1_itpqy92", "score": "8", "subreddit": "changemyview", "subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8"}, {"author": "Hoihe", "body": "I'd say the inverse.\n\nOrb\u00e1n is using Putin's playbook.\n\nTrump is Orb\u00e1n's.", "created_utc": "1666707503.0", "edited": "False", "id": "itq4im7", "is_submitter": "True", "link_id": "t3_yd0rwg", "parent_id": "t1_itq3yli", "score": "1", "subreddit": "worldnews", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13"}, {"author": "Hoihe", "body": "What about\n\n\"Other side wants me dead/miserable, so i refuse to surrender/give in?\"\n\nIt is pretty much the modt significant motivator in my life (live under mini-putin as a transgender woman)", "created_utc": "1666605216.0", "edited": "False", "id": "itkjpl7", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_ybt0iw", "parent_id": "t1_itimq59", "score": "10", "subreddit": "SelfAwarewolves", "subreddit_id": "t5_3g3zk"}, {"author": "Hoihe", "body": "I've seen gender abolitionists claim I'm transphobic because I said\n\n\"I am a transgender woman because my brain expects my body to have female-typical hormones, primary and secondary sex characteristics.\"\n\nApparently saying this is... transphobic towards trans men?\n\nThe person in question wasn't a trans man.", "created_utc": "1666585468.0", "edited": "False", "id": "itjv3md", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_ybdguq", "parent_id": "t1_itjhxa3", "score": "1", "subreddit": "asktransgender", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r4b9"}, {"author": "Hoihe", "body": "As long as you use an ORCID or some other identifier that connects your work, a CV might not be necessary.", "created_utc": "1666585317.0", "edited": "False", "id": "itjuulw", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_ybtoza", "parent_id": "t1_itj3x5l", "score": "5", "subreddit": "AskAcademia", "subreddit_id": "t5_2sakj"}, {"author": "Hoihe", "body": "Get yourself an ORCID.\n\nIt should help you down the line if your university does force you to use your government-mandated name over your real one.\n\nPersonally, I've been doing the I.

Sexual differentiation of the human brain in relation to gender identity and sexual orientation. Functional Neurology, 24(1), 17\u201328. https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0805542105\n\nIn this cited paper, Swaab et al studied people with a condition known as Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome. Androgen Insensitivty syndrome causes testosterone (and other androgen) hormones to have failure binding to their appropriate receptors, or for those receptors to provide a lesser signal than they should.\n\nThe consequence of AAS can range from underdeveloped testes and penis with gynecomastia to having a vagina with gonads that are neither testicles nor ovaries.\n\nIt has been found by Swaab et al that depending on which specific androgens are blocked, gender identity varies: Total AAS led to a person to become a cisgender intersex woman, whereas partial AAS led to a transgender intersex man.\n\nBy observing this, Swaab et al demonstrate that gender identity is likely controlled by how the brain interacts with hormone levels during foetal and perhaps early childhood development, independent of nurture. This can be caused by less-extreme forms of genetic disorders that affects hormone processing, and it's also possible for such disorders to be \"localized\" - the genes are there, working... but the other genes regulating the expression of the genes regulating testosterone receptor proteins might be locally dysfunctional, causing too much/too little exposure, affecting gender identity.\n\n********\n\n\n**As seen above, gender identity is intrinsic to the individual and cannot be changed. What about sex? Well - let's consider what sexual dimorphism actually is!**\n\n\n********\n\none can read any Graduate level biology textbook regarding human sexual dimorphism. There, they would learn that gonadal differentiation is initiated by the SRY gene on the Y chromosome. This singular gene determines if your gonads develop into ovaries or testicles. The rest of the Y chromosome acts to regulate the function of testicles, and to assist in its healthy development.\n\nThe rest of human sexual differentiation is initiated by the gonads themselves - gonads produce sex hormones: estrogens, androgens and progesterons. These estrogens, androgens and progesterons then bind with their respective receptors (which, barring androgen receptors - which are found on the X chromosome - are found scattered on 6 and 14 and 17 somatic chromosomes. Somatic chromosomes are the same in men and women), altering gene expression.\n\nThis altered gene expression is drawn primarily from somatic chromosomes, and is found in both men and women.\n\nHuman sexual differentiation, therefore - using graduate level biology:\n\nPresence or absence of SRY gene decides if you get testicles or ovaries\nOvaries/Testicles develop, potentially failing due to genetic disorders. Assuming they don't fail.\nOvaries/Testicles produce an abundance of either androgens, or estrogens (with progesterone becoming relevant after puberty mostly)\nThese sex hormones act on hormone receptors, which are primarily governed by somatic chromosomes (ergo: same in XX and XY)\nThese receptors alter gene expression\nThis gene expression causes healthy development of gonads, genitalia and secondary sex characteristics.\nTherefore, if you read it - you find that sexual differentiation is dictated by endocrine levels (barring things like disorders caused by doubling of X chromosome and gonadal function).\n\nTherefore, a woman, using purely biological terms - is a person whose gene expression is primarily dictated by estrogen and progesterone levels. If you care about reproduction, you add the presence of functioning testes or ovaries. But people can live full lives without either, and many women need hysterectomy in order to survive due to cancer or genetic disorders.\n\n**Therefore, a transgender woman who is on a strict HRT regiment whose gonads were removed is functionally no different from an androgen-insensitive woman.**", "created_utc": "1666541185.0", "edited": "False", "id": "itgyzyy", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_ybjz4u", "parent_id": "t1_itgthpy", "score": "3", "subreddit": "changemyview", "subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8"}, {"author": "Hoihe", "body": "Yes, I'd still be trans.\n\nMy brain expects a body that underwent estrogen dominant puberty.

I also have my attention randomly fail while listening by focusing on a single word spoken and failing to hear the rest.\n\nFurthermore, if it's an environment that has a lot of sensory stimulation - lights, noise, just people in general - I at minimum end up feeling exhausted and frustrated trying to hold a conversation, at worst I'll literally stop being able to process spoken word. I hear what you say, but my brain cannot separate your words from the background noise and it all melds into a singular garbled sound (imagine watching movies with bad sound balance and being forced to use subtitles to follow the plot. Well, that's talking to people in physical space for me unless it's sufficiently quiet and focused).\n\nFinally, too much stress (simply from noise, lights, quantity of people) can and has made me lose my voice - like, I open my mouth, try and force dialogue and no sound comes.

My difficulties regarding verbal communication evaporate when I have the opportunity to type - no more body language being misinterpreted by either me or my communication partner, no more weird pitch modulation or slurring words together, no more being unable to hear what someone says due to absence of competent sensory filtration or mismanagement of attention - typing and reading solves all of this! Furthermore, bigots can't stab me if I'm staying home.\n\nAnd so - I will pick being on my phone over talking to strangers or even friends in public spaces.

It is a complex term which we can split into 2 simpler constituents that also have the word, \"gender\" within them complicating things.\n\nLet's start with **constituent A - Social Gender Identity.** Social Gender is what feminism refers to when its proponents say, \"Gender is a social construct!\" (which i agree with). \n\nSocial gender is something arbitrary that society decided to impose upon its members based on their genitalia, sexual phenotype and/or sexual orientation.\n\nWithin social gender we can find the concepts of dress codes, acceptable emotional expressions, behaviour policing, jobs you are (not) allowed to do, your rights and duties and so forth. (Almost) All of this is arbtirary, and if you go to another culture - may change completely. Sometimes you don't even need to go far, just move from a rural village to the capital to experience a drastic change in what it means to be a woman (in my village, people consider being a scientist a male job and look at women weird for going to univ rather than having children, whereas my university in Hungary's capital is full of scholarships encouraging women to get into science).\n\nNow, Autistic people are often described in pop science articles as \"lacking\" an innate understanding of social constructs, which i can sorta identify with! Thus, if we accept this as true - then it makes sense that for those of us whose brains are wired differently, the whole arbitrary idea of social gender with all its unjustified and random rules feel wrong, alien and \"hard to understand.\"\n\nNow, this could mean autistic people have a large number of non-binary/agender individuals. Or it could just make the community gender non-conforming. The only good thing about social gender - because of how utterly random and arbitrary it is - self ID is not only valid: it's encouraged! As such, I self ID as \"Gender non-conforming woman (by standards of rural Hungary)\" It's something of a tongue-in-cheek self ID for me, as I am tired of people telling me I can't be a woman if I like sword fighting and science and maths.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut there's another component to gender I havn't mentioned yet, and something as a neuroscientist may find interesting! \nThe 2 most up to date papers I base this upon:  \nhttps://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-17352-8  (2017)  \nhttps://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-80687-2  (2021)  \n\nThere's more than these two, but these two in particular approached the question by controlling for sexual orientation and ignored social biases like maths skills or language skills. Or rather: They controlled for them. \n\nControlling for all that, these papers found that the brains of transgender individuals differed from those of cisgender individuals. *For sake of not being an unwilling advocate for transmedicalists: This paper focuses on those transgender individuals with \"Physical dysphoria\", and those trans people who are entirely based on the social gender are completely valid.* With that out of the way: \n\nThe 2017 paper found that transgender people show differences in brain regions corresponding to how the individual perceives their own body, regions that create a sense of \"Ownership\" over one's own body. The 2021 paper found that if a transgender person starts to medically transition using hormone replacement therapy, these differences reduce. Taking karyotpe-approrpiate (so estrogen for FTM, testosterone for MTF) did NOT provide improvements, in fact cisgender people taking hormones experienced neural degradation. \n\nThe 2021 paper proposed 2 mechanisms (but it was out of scope to decide which is the real one, but they admitted it could be both) as such:  \n**Mechanism 1:**    \nCross-sex hormones directly interact with neural structures, strengthening the weakened connections.  \n**Mechanism 2:**    \nBy having the body look more like, AND function more like the brain expects it to - these weakened structures strengthen in kind of a feedback loop mumbo jumbo.\n\n\nAs such, we arrive to **Constituent B - Internal Gender Identity/Neural Gender**. Neural Gender is thus defined: A particular sexual phenotype (either binary male or female, or in between) that the brain expects the body to possess after puberty finishes. This includes gonads, endocrine levels and primary & secondary sex characteristics. Any deviation from what the brain expects creates either a direct sense of distress, or a dull pain that is only recognized once eased (in other words: dysphoria). \n\nChances are, if you do not feel any acute sense of distress in regards to your sexual characteristics, and the idea of altering them (including your hormonal make up) does not make you feel you would experience an improvement of mental health, then your neural gender is aligned with your sexual phenotype. \n\nThis does NOT mean you cannot be trans. It just means that if you do not particularly feel attached to the social gender that is \"Woman\" in western (post)-Christian society, it does not mean you are not allowed to call yourself a woman.\n\n\n\nTo be transgender, one of the following must be true:\nYour Social Gender Identity differs from what society assigns to your sexual phenotype & sexual orientation   \n**INCLUSIVE OR**  \nYour Internal Gender Identity differs at least in one component (not necessarily ALL components - you are totally valid if you only feel dysphoric due to hormonal stuff and don't want beard or whatever) from the sexual phenotype your body expressed through puberty.\n\n\n\nPersonally, I have a fairly strong overlap of my internal gender identity's expectations with that of the typical human female sexual phenotype, and as such I am pursuing medical transition to achieve that. As a consequence, I identify as a woman.\n\nHowever, I also lack a particularly strong attachment towards any particular social gender identity, bar a few specifics (name, address, culturally influenced idea of how a woman must look like [Long hair, smooth skin under the neck]). I still identify as a woman though, as I place more weight (Personally) on my internal gender identity && I am a feminist, so I reject many of the things my country assigns to women in terms of duties and behaviour and whatnot.\n\n\n\n\n\nHope it helps!", "created_utc": "1666115525.0", "edited": "False", "id": "istwplo", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_y6g1pp", "parent_id": "t3_y6g1pp", "score": "1", "subreddit": "NoStupidQuestions", "subreddit_id": "t5_2w844"}, {"author": "Hoihe", "body": "I used to get very confusing encountering bigotry amongst readers and roleplayers - after all, the whole thing is about losing yourself and becoming someone distinct and different to you (even if similar).", "created_utc": "1666027849.0", "edited": "False", "id": "isp44do", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_y6c5nz", "parent_id": "t1_isodyph", "score": "1", "subreddit": "books", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh4i"}, {"author": "Hoihe", "body": "This is me in lab.", "created_utc": "1666026773.0", "edited": "False", "id": "isp1hk1", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_y6b6mq", "parent_id": "t1_isoidan", "score": "1", "subreddit": "ADHD", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qnwb"}, {"author": "Hoihe", "body": "People to whom politics is just a question of 5% more or less paycheck dont realize how it is a matter of life and death to many of us.\n\nEspecially in places like russia, hungary, poland and ukraine", "created_utc": "1666025537.0", "edited": "False", "id": "isoyhr1", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_y64tpn", "parent_id": "t1_iso53mh", "score": "14", "subreddit": "actuallesbians", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rch0"}, {"author": "Hoihe", "body": "Someone being lgbt and also homophobic confuses me to no end.", "created_utc": "1666025405.0", "edited": "False", "id": "isoy67n", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_y64tpn", "parent_id": "t1_iso4k05", "score": "253", "subreddit": "actuallesbians", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rch0"}, {"author": "Hoihe", "body": "Tbh.

The country or union handles this.\n\nPrimary Education is handled by the union to ensure every kid has access to quality elementary school education. \n\nAt end of elementary school, the austrian/german system kicks in: High schools are the responsibility of counties, or in case of cities: districts. \n\nStudents finishing elementary school are given a union-observed test of logic, reading comprehension and composition and scored. Their score is stored along an anonymized string. \n\nThese kids then apply anonymously to any school that's part of the union, then if they are part of the top 30 students for the class they applied for - move there away from their parents and live inside dorms, going home only on weekends or breaks (ages 14-18). This ensures people can access quality education regardless of where their parents live.  Before you're skeptical: this already exists in Hungary, Austria and Germany (but at a national scale rather than union). These classes can teach U.S style HS (Gymnasium), U.S style H.S with a trade (Trade Gymnasium. I attended one like this, for chemistry industrial technicianship) and just a trade school. \nAfter trade school, people can go work immediately.\nAfter (trade) gymnasium, they must pass the Arbitur - essentially equivalent to U.S associate's degree on history, linguistics, foreign language (if it's still relevant then. atm it's english in HU/GE/Austria), mathematics. If they pass this, they may take on optional exams on chemistry, physics, advanced versions of the earlier, biology and special trades (I took one on Chemical Industrial knowledge at advanced level, alongside Advanced Chemistry).\n\nAdult education\n\nCounties handle trade training. This trade training either provides basic trade school, an advanced variant that needs the basic version (attend the appropriate trade school or trade gymnasium) specialist forms (like a Chemical Technician specialises in Analytical Tech, which is what I did).\n\nCollege education is handled by the union due to funding requirements, but they decide curriculum and focus on needs for diploma-based jobs (engineers, accountants, that kind of deal).\n\nUniversity education is likewise funded by the government, but handled independently from it for sake of academic freedom. This is anthropology, economics, history, chemistry, physics, biology. I am going to a Chemistry university, studying chemical physics.\n\n\nHealthcare:\n\nSinglepayer healthcare, counties take care of building hospitals. Towns take care of clinics.\n\nPrivate clinics and private practicioners at hospitals exist as an option. (This is how I got to transition). However, price controls cap how much they can charge, to avoid the U.S situation.\nSocial Housing\n\nZoning laws are abolished, massive encouragement for personal investment into construction of duplexes, triplexes. \n\nLocal Government handles condos, apartments, \"panel\" buildings. Condos, apartments, \"Panel\" buildings are rented from the city/town, which collects enough to perform maintenance and save up for upgrades, but does not collect for sake of \"turning a profit.\" Those who buy out flats within these buildings can only sell them back to the government, and there a profit is sought in form of taxes.\n\nDuplexes, triplexes may be rented by private entities.\n\n\nProtecting other industries from being gobbled up\n\nBy eliminating voting shares, we avoid industries from being merged by capitalists. As a consequence, you no longer need to convince the singular investment firm to hand over the company, you need to convince each and every manufacturing plant independently,  each and every private farm and so forth.\n\nRather than industries being ran by government or capitalists, they are ran by experts hired by the workers. These experts are beholden to the workers, and a vote of no-confidence allows the workers to fire them at any time - just like shareholders can fire execs.

We can witness this in various subcultures (The concept of \"tomboys\" and \"butch lesbians\", a woman who dresses and behaves as a man traditionally should) (Identity and Expression clashing). \n\nThe idea of \"I'm a man, so I don't wear a skirt\" pertains not to gender identity, but gender expression. Potentially, to your gender role as a way to advertise what role in society you fulfil by dressing the part. However, being a man does not dictate you cannot wear a skirt.\n\n\n\n**For Intrinsic gender identity itself, I'll depart from social science and onto neuropsychology.**\n\n\n\n*Burke et al (2017)* found was found that after controlling for sexual/romantic orientation, culture, etc... there exist a difference between transgender people (with physical dysphoria, before transitioning medically) and cisgender people when it comes to neural structures.\n\nThese differences manifest primarily in neuro-motor regions, regions corresponding for sensory processing. Basically, places where the brain communicates with the body. \n\nThe differences are that these regions appear \"underdeveloped\", as if not being exercised.\n\nIt's not \"male brain\" or \"female brain\", it's \"my brain doesn't get the responses from my body that it expects\" vs \"my body looks and behaves like my brain expects.\"\n\n*Khorashad et al (2021)* later investigated these findings, finding that these neural differences disappear upon taking gender-confirming cross-sex hormonal therapy. Or at the very least, minimize. \n\nMeaning, it appears that the weakened connections become exercised and reinforced.\n\nThis explains why trans people who have medically transitioned no longer exhibit these patterns, and also tracks with reports of gender dysphoria easing over time even though the person does not culturally/socially pass.\n\n**Two methods of action are proposed:**\n\na) body feels and behaves as the brain's \"internal blueprint\" expects it to: hormone levels are correct, the proper genes are expressed now, the right proteins and shape and function.\n\nJust like doing exercises reinforces neural pathways, so does the body responding like the brain expects it to does the same.\n\nb) Hormones directly bind with hormone receptors in the brain, encouraging the formation of new neural structures.\n\nB would explain what some trans people call \"hormonal/endocrine dysphoria.\" Or rather the euphoria from being on hormones even before physical changes set in.\n\nThe two mechanisms proposed are not exclusive, but yet to be determined.\n\n\nBurke, S.M., Manzouri, A.H. & Savic, I.

Sexual differentiation of the human brain in relation to gender identity and sexual orientation. Functional Neurology, 24(1), 17\u201328. https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0805542105\n\nIn this cited paper, Swaab et al studied people with a condition known as Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome. Androgen Insensitivty syndrome causes testosterone (and other androgen) hormones to have failure binding to their appropriate receptors, or for those receptors to provide a lesser signal than they should.\n\nThe consequence of AAS can range from underdeveloped testes and penis with gynecomastia to having a vagina with gonads that are neither testicles nor ovaries.\n\nIt has been found by Swaab et al that depending on which specific androgens are blocked, gender identity varies: Total AAS led to a person to become a cisgender intersex woman, whereas partial AAS led to a transgender intersex man.\n\nBy observing this, Swaab et al demonstrate that gender identity is likely controlled by how the brain interacts with hormone levels during foetal and perhaps early childhood development, independent of nurture. This can be caused by less-extreme forms of genetic disorders that affects hormone processing, and it's also possible for such disorders to be \"localized\" - the genes are there, working... but the other genes regulating the expression of the genes regulating testosterone receptor proteins might be locally dysfunctional, causing too much/too little exposure, affecting gender identity.\n\n********\n\n\n**As seen above, gender identity is intrinsic to the individual and cannot be changed. What about sex? Well - let's consider what sexual dimorphism actually is!**\n\n\n********\n\none can read any Graduate level biology textbook regarding human sexual dimorphism. There, they would learn that gonadal differentiation is initiated by the SRY gene on the Y chromosome. This singular gene determines if your gonads develop into ovaries or testicles. The rest of the Y chromosome acts to regulate the function of testicles, and to assist in its healthy development.\n\nThe rest of human sexual differentiation is initiated by the gonads themselves - gonads produce sex hormones: estrogens, androgens and progesterons. These estrogens, androgens and progesterons then bind with their respective receptors (which, barring androgen receptors - which are found on the X chromosome - are found scattered on 6 and 14 and 17 somatic chromosomes. Somatic chromosomes are the same in men and women), altering gene expression.\n\nThis altered gene expression is drawn primarily from somatic chromosomes, and is found in both men and women.\n\nHuman sexual differentiation, therefore - using graduate level biology:\n\nPresence or absence of SRY gene decides if you get testicles or ovaries\nOvaries/Testicles develop, potentially failing due to genetic disorders. Assuming they don't fail.\nOvaries/Testicles produce an abundance of either androgens, or estrogens (with progesterone becoming relevant after puberty mostly)\nThese sex hormones act on hormone receptors, which are primarily governed by somatic chromosomes (ergo: same in XX and XY)\nThese receptors alter gene expression\nThis gene expression causes healthy development of gonads, genitalia and secondary sex characteristics.\nTherefore, if you read it - you find that sexual differentiation is dictated by endocrine levels (barring things like disorders caused by doubling of X chromosome and gonadal function).\n\nTherefore, a woman, using purely biological terms - is a person whose gene expression is primarily dictated by estrogen and progesterone levels. If you care about reproduction, you add the presence of functioning testes or ovaries. But people can live full lives without either, and many women need hysterectomy in order to survive due to cancer or genetic disorders.\n\n**Therefore, a transgender woman who is on a strict HRT regiment whose gonads were removed is functionally no different from an androgen-insensitive woman.**", "created_utc": "1665508443.0", "edited": "False", "id": "irwuy7r", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_y0w2yb", "parent_id": "t1_irvhlr5", "score": "1", "subreddit": "transgender", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qxpm"}, {"author": "Hoihe", "body": "In my opinion, Social Democracy is our best approach.\n\nFirst - liberate people from being beholden to family, state, church, corporations or anything that demands social conformity for survival.

It is a complex term which we can split into 2 simpler constituents that also have the word, \"gender\" within them complicating things.\n\nLet's start with **constituent A - Social Gender Identity.** Social Gender is what feminism refers to when its proponents say, \"Gender is a social construct!\" (which i agree with). \n\nSocial gender is something arbitrary that society decided to impose upon its members based on their genitalia, sexual phenotype and/or sexual orientation.\n\nWithin social gender we can find the concepts of dress codes, acceptable emotional expressions, behaviour policing, jobs you are (not) allowed to do, your rights and duties and so forth. (Almost) All of this is arbtirary, and if you go to another culture - may change completely. Sometimes you don't even need to go far, just move from a rural village to the capital to experience a drastic change in what it means to be a woman (in my village, people consider being a scientist a male job and look at women weird for going to univ rather than having children, whereas my university in Hungary's capital is full of scholarships encouraging women to get into science).\n\nNow, Autistic people are often described in pop science articles as \"lacking\" an innate understanding of social constructs, which i can sorta identify with! Thus, if we accept this as true - then it makes sense that for those of us whose brains are wired differently, the whole arbitrary idea of social gender with all its unjustified and random rules feel wrong, alien and \"hard to understand.\"\n\nNow, this could mean autistic people have a large number of non-binary/agender individuals. Or it could just make the community gender non-conforming. The only good thing about social gender - because of how utterly random and arbitrary it is - self ID is not only valid: it's encouraged! As such, I self ID as \"Gender non-conforming woman (by standards of rural Hungary)\" It's something of a tongue-in-cheek self ID for me, as I am tired of people telling me I can't be a woman if I like sword fighting and science and maths.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut there's another component to gender I havn't mentioned yet, and something as a neuroscientist may find interesting! \nThe 2 most up to date papers I base this upon:  \nhttps://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-17352-8  (2017)  \nhttps://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-80687-2  (2021)  \n\nThere's more than these two, but these two in particular approached the question by controlling for sexual orientation and ignored social biases like maths skills or language skills. Or rather: They controlled for them. \n\nControlling for all that, these papers found that the brains of transgender individuals differed from those of cisgender individuals. *For sake of not being an unwilling advocate for transmedicalists: This paper focuses on those transgender individuals with \"Physical dysphoria\", and those trans people who are entirely based on the social gender are completely valid.* With that out of the way: \n\nThe 2017 paper found that transgender people show differences in brain regions corresponding to how the individual perceives their own body, regions that create a sense of \"Ownership\" over one's own body. The 2021 paper found that if a transgender person starts to medically transition using hormone replacement therapy, these differences reduce. Taking karyotpe-approrpiate (so estrogen for FTM, testosterone for MTF) did NOT provide improvements, in fact cisgender people taking hormones experienced neural degradation. \n\nThe 2021 paper proposed 2 mechanisms (but it was out of scope to decide which is the real one, but they admitted it could be both) as such:  \n**Mechanism 1:**    \nCross-sex hormones directly interact with neural structures, strengthening the weakened connections.  \n**Mechanism 2:**    \nBy having the body look more like, AND function more like the brain expects it to - these weakened structures strengthen in kind of a feedback loop mumbo jumbo.\n\n\nAs such, we arrive to **Constituent B - Internal Gender Identity/Neural Gender**. Neural Gender is thus defined: A particular sexual phenotype (either binary male or female, or in between) that the brain expects the body to possess after puberty finishes. This includes gonads, endocrine levels and primary & secondary sex characteristics. Any deviation from what the brain expects creates either a direct sense of distress, or a dull pain that is only recognized once eased (in other words: dysphoria). \n\nChances are, if you do not feel any acute sense of distress in regards to your sexual characteristics, and the idea of altering them (including your hormonal make up) does not make you feel you would experience an improvement of mental health, then your neural gender is aligned with your sexual phenotype. \n\nThis does NOT mean you cannot be trans. It just means that if you do not particularly feel attached to the social gender that is \"Woman\" in western (post)-Christian society, it does not mean you are not allowed to call yourself a woman.\n\n\n\nTo be transgender, one of the following must be true:\nYour Social Gender Identity differs from what society assigns to your sexual phenotype & sexual orientation   \n**INCLUSIVE OR**  \nYour Internal Gender Identity differs at least in one component (not necessarily ALL components - you are totally valid if you only feel dysphoric due to hormonal stuff and don't want beard or whatever) from the sexual phenotype your body expressed through puberty.\n\n\n\nPersonally, I have a fairly strong overlap of my internal gender identity's expectations with that of the typical human female sexual phenotype, and as such I am pursuing medical transition to achieve that. As a consequence, I identify as a woman.\n\nHowever, I also lack a particularly strong attachment towards any particular social gender identity, bar a few specifics (name, address, culturally influenced idea of how a woman must look like [Long hair, smooth skin under the neck]). I still identify as a woman though, as I place more weight (Personally) on my internal gender identity && I am a feminist, so I reject many of the things my country assigns to women in terms of duties and behaviour and whatnot.\n\n\n\n\n\nHope it helps!", "created_utc": "1665500462.0", "edited": "False", "id": "irwautn", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_y16aua", "parent_id": "t3_y16aua", "score": "4", "subreddit": "NoStupidQuestions", "subreddit_id": "t5_2w844"}, {"author": "Hoihe", "body": "To liberate people from church and family, taxes must exist.

Psychology, statistics, and all history prove that individual and social immorality are the inevitable consequences of a false private and public education, of the degeneration of public morality and the corruption of public opinion, and above all, of. the vicious organization of society. An eminent Belgian statistician [Qu\u00e9telet] points out that society opens the way for the crimes later committed by malefactors. It follows that all attempts to combat social immorality by rigorous legislation which violates individual freedom must fail. Experience, on the contrary, demonstrates that a repressive and authoritarian system, far from preventing, only increases crime; that public and private morality falls or rises to the extent that individual liberty is restricted or enlarged. It follows that in order to regenerate society, we must first completely uproot this political and social system founded on inequality, privilege, and contempt for humanity. After having reconstructed society on the basis of the most complete liberty, equality, and justice \u2014 not to mention work \u2014 for all and an enlightened education inspired by respect for man \u2014 public opinion will then reflect the new humanity and become a natural guardian of the most absolute liberty [and public order. Ed.].\n> * Society cannot, however, leave itself completely defenseless against vicious and parasitic individuals. Work must be the basis of all political rights. The units of society, each within its own jurisdiction, can deprive all such antisocial adults of political rights (except the old, the sick, and those dependent on private or public subsidy) and will be obliged to restore their political rights as soon as they begin to live by their own labor.\n> * The liberty of every human being is inalienable and society will never require any individual to surrender his liberty or to sign contracts with other individuals except on the basis of the most complete equality and reciprocity. Society cannot forcibly prevent any man or woman so devoid of personal dignity as to place him- or herself in voluntary servitude to another individual; but it can justly treat such persons as parasites, not entitled to the enjoyment of political liberty, though only for the duration of their servitude.\n> * Persons losing their political rights will also lose custody of their children. Persons who violate voluntary agreements, steal, inflict bodily harm, or above all, violate the freedom of any individual, native or foreigner, will be penalized according to the laws of society.\n> * Individuals condemned by the laws of any and every association (commune, province, region, or nation) reserve the right to escape punishment by declaring that they wish to resign from that association. But in this case, the association will have the equal right to expel him and declare him outside its guarantee and protection.\n\n\n**Basic Individualism:**\n\n> For individualism to exist, the following must be true:\n> \n> **\\0. The circumstances of birth are minimized, ideally removed. One's nationality, ethnicity, parentage/pedigree, neurotype, gender, sex, sexual/romantic orientation should NOT determine one's opportunities in life.** \n> \n> This is achieved through \n> \n> * opening borders (ethnicity, nationality)\n> * free access to quality education, extra-curricular programs, food and shelter as children (welfare, public healthcare, public education (my preferred form is the Austrian, where the child can decide on what they wish to study and attend any school anywhere regardless of parental wealth) (parentage/pedigree)\n> * Abolishment of gender roles (gender/sex circumstances)\n> * Anti-discrimination laws (gender, sex, orientation circumstances)\n> * Screening for neurodivergences, and resources dedicated to accomodate people's impairments so they do not become disabilities while recognizing they are just as intelligent and capable (ADHD kids allowed to have the right amount of stimulation, autistic folk allowed to study through reading over sitting in lectures with consultations, that kind of thing)\n> \n> **\\1. People should be capable of fulfilling their cultural, ethnic, religious, gender, romantic/sexual identities without it negatively affecting their ability to survive.** \n> \n> Caveats:\n> \n> * If fulfilment of identity requires \"traditional gender roles\" for your wife, it can ONLY be done as long as those participating consent (where consent is NOT coerced, ACTIVELY given. Meaning, adult with adult, children cannot be forced into traditional gender roles. Your wife can always stop consenting, and divorce you without justification.)\n> * If fulfilment of identity requires restricting another person's ability to fulfil their own in a reasonable manner. Ergo - having a transgender co-worker in a laboratory does not limit your ability to fulfil your christian identity. Not being able to get hired because you're trans or a sikh DOES limit your ability to fulfil your gender/religious identity. If your religious identity requires the murder of LGBT people, then being barred from murdering them is an acceptable sacrifice of your liberty we can make.\n> \n> **\\2. People should have their basic needs (healthcare, shelter, basic nutrition, privacy) guaranteed regardless of ability to work or socialize or fit in.**\n> \n> **\\3. People MUST have an ADEQUATE access to pursuing intellectual, athletic, cultural and social activities.**\n> \n> * Adequate: Must have free time to do so. For a minimum requirement, we can achieve this through maximizing monthly working hours at 160 hours a month and minimum 25 days paid time off.\n> * Adequate: Must have a way to choose what they want. This can be labour voucher, money, whatever. It should not be decided for them\n> * Adequate: Using whatever representation of value, they should have enough working even a part time job with disabilities to seek personal fulfilment (maybe they won't be able to afford a schooner to pursue historical re-enaction and living history research as a private person, but they can buy books about boats and afford computer simulations, attend a club where they collectively own a schooner for re-enactment).\n\nper \n\nMinkov, M., Dutt, P., Schachner, M., Morales, O., Sanchez, C., Jandosova, J., Khassenbekov, Y. and Mudd, B.

The union of nations comprising the International Federation will be based on the principles outlined above. It is probable, and strongly desired as well, that when the hour of the People\u2019s Revolution strikes again, every nation will unite in brotherly solidarity and forge an unbreakable alliance against the coalition of reactionary nations. This alliance will be the germ of the future Universal Federation of Peoples which will eventually embrace the entire world. The International Federation of revolutionary peoples, with a parliament, a tribunal, and an international executive committee, will naturally be based on the principles of the revolution. Applied to international polity these principles are:\n\n> * Every land, every nation, every people, large or small, weak or strong, every region, province, and commune has the absolute right to self-determination, to make alliances, unite or secede as it pleases, regardless of so-called historic rights and the political, commercial, or strategic ambitions of States. The unity of the elements of society, in order to be genuine, fruitful, and durable, must be absolutely free: it can emerge only from the internal needs and mutual attractions of the respective units of society....\n> * Abolition of alleged historic right and the horrible right of conquest.\n> * Absolute rejection of the politics of aggrandizement, of the power and the glory of the State. For this is a form of politics which locks each country into a self-made fortress, shutting out the rest of humanity, organizing itself into a closed world, independent of all human solidarity, finding its glory and prosperity in the evil it can do to other countries. A country bent on conquest is necessarily a country internally enslaved.\n> * The glory and grandeur of a nation lie only in the development of its humanity. Its strength and inner vitality are measured by the degree of its liberty.\n> * The well-being and the freedom of nations as well as individuals are inextricably interwoven. Therefore, there must be free commerce, exchange, and communication among all federated countries, and abolition of frontiers, passports, and customs duties [tariffs]. Every citizen of a federated country must enjoy the same civic rights and it must be easy for him to acquire citizenship and enjoy political rights in all other countries adhering to the same federation. If liberty is the starting point, it will necessarily lead to unity. But to go from unity to liberty is difficult, if not impossible; even if it were possible, it could be done only by destroying a spurious \u201cunity\u201d imposed by force....\n> * No federated country shall maintain a permanent standing army or any institution separating the soldier from the civilian. Not only do permanent ,armies and professional soldiers breed internal disruption, brutalization, and financial ruin, they also menace the independence and well-being of other nations. All able-bodied citizens should, if necessary, take up arms to defend their homes and their freedom. Each country\u2019s military defense and equipment should be organized locally by the commune, or provincially, somewhat like the militias in Switzerland or the United States of America [circa 1860\u20137].\n> * The International Tribunal shall have no other function than to settle, without appeal, all disputes between nations and their respective provinces. Differences between two federated countries shall be adjudicated, without appeal, only by the International Parliament, which, in the name of the entire revolutionary federation, will also formulate common policy and make war, if unavoidable, against the reactionary coalition.\n> * No federated nation shall make war against another federated country. If there is war and the International Tribunal has pronounced its decision, the aggressor must submit. If this doesn\u2019t occur, the other federated nations will sever relations with it and, in case of attack by the aggressor, unite to repel invasion.\n> * All members of the revolutionary federation must actively take part in approved wars against a nonfederated state. If a federated nation declares unjust war on an outside State against the advice of the International Tribunal, it will be notified in advance that it will have to do so alone.\n> * It is hoped that the federated states will eventually give up the expensive luxury of separate diplomatic representatives to foreign states and arrange for representatives to speak in the name of all the federated States.\n> * Only nations or peoples accepting the principles outlined in this catechism will be admitted to the federation.\n\n\n\nFull text available for free: https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/michail-bakunin-revolutionary-catechism", "created_utc": "1665471204.0", "edited": "False", "id": "irv1lj5", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_y10ele", "parent_id": "t1_irv1ijw", "score": "1", "subreddit": "CapitalismVSocialism", "subreddit_id": "t5_3cct3"}, {"author": "Hoihe", "body": "In Bakunin's system governance exists.\n\nJudges exist.\n\nThe difference is it is led \"Base first\" rather than \"summit first\"\n\nQuoting the Revolutionary Catechism:\n\n\n\n> The internal reorganization of each country on the basis of the absolute freedom of individuals, of the productive associations, and of the communes. Necessity of recognizing the right of secession: every individual, every association, every commune, every region, every nation has the absolute right to self-determination, to associate or not to associate, to ally themselves with whomever they wish and repudiate their alliances without regard to so-called historic rights [rights consecrated by legal precedent] or the convenience of their neighbors. Once the right to secede is established, secession will no longer be necessary. With the dissolution of a \u201cunity\u201d imposed by violence, the units of society will be drawn to unite by their powerful mutual attraction and by inherent necessities. Consecrated by liberty, these new federations of communes, provinces, regions, and nations will then be truly strong, productive, and indissoluble.\n\n**Regarding Judges:**\n\n\n> *  Abolition, dissolution, and moral, political, and economic dismantling of the all-pervasive, regimented, centralized State, the alter ego of the Church, and as such, the permanent cause of the impoverishment, brutalization, and enslavement of the multitude. This naturally entails the following: Abolition of all state universities: public education must be administered only by the communes and free associations. Abolition of the State judiciary: all judges must be elected by the people. Abolition of all criminal, civil, and legal codes now administered in Europe: because the code of liberty can be created only by liberty itself. Abolition of banks and all other institutions of state credit. Abolition of all centralized administration, of the bureaucracy, of all permanent armies and state police.\n> * Immediate direct election of all judicial and civil functionaries as well as representatives (national, provincial, and communal delegates) by the universal suffrage of both sexes.\n\n**How government is to be structured**\n\n> * Rights of association [federalism]. The cooperative workers\u2019 associations are a new fact in history. At this time we can only speculate about, but not determine, the immense development that they will doubtlessly exhibit in the new political and social conditions of the future. It is possible and even very likely that they will some day transcend the limits of towns, provinces, and even states. They may entirely reconstitute society, dividing it not into nations but into different industrial groups, organized not according to the needs of politics but to those of production. But this is for the future. Be that as it may, we can already proclaim this fundamental principle: irrespective of their functions or aims, all associations, like all individuals, must enjoy absolute freedom. Neither society, nor any part of society \u2014 commune, province, or nation \u2014 has the right to prevent free individuals from associating freely for any purpose whatsoever: political, religious, scientific, artistic, or even for the exploitation or corruption of the naive or alcoholics, provided that they are not minors. To combat charlatans and pernicious associations is the special affair of public opinion. But society is obliged to refuse to guarantee civic rights of any association or collective body whose aims or rules violate the fundamental principles of human justice. Individuals shall not be penalized or deprived of their full political and social rights solely for belonging to such unrecognized societies. The difference between the recognized and unrecognized associations will be the following: the juridically recognized associations will have the right to the protection of the community against individuals or recognized groups who refuse to fulfill their voluntary obligations.\u2019 The juridically unrecognized associations will not be entitled to such protection by the community and none of their agreements will be regarded as binding.\n> * The division of a country into regions, provinces, districts, and communes, as in France, will naturally depend on the traditions, the specific circumstances, and the particular nature of each country. We can only point out here the two fundamental and indispensable principles which must be put into effect by any country seriously trying to organize a free society. First: all organizations must proceed by way of federation from the base to the summit, from the commune to the coordinating association of the country or nation. Second: there must be at least one autonomous intermediate body between the commune and the country, the department, the region, or the province. Without such an autonomous intermediate body, the commune (in the strict sense of the term) would be too isolated and too weak to be able to resist the despotic centralistic pressure of the State, which will inevitably (as happened twice in France) restore to power a despotic monarchical regime. Despotism has its source much more in the centralized organization of the State, than in the despotic nature of kings.\n> * The basic unit of all political organization in each country must be the completely autonomous commune, constituted by the majority vote of all adults of both sexes. No one shall have either the power or the right to interfere in the internal life of the commune. The commune elects all functionaries, law-makers, and judges. It administers the communal property and finances. Every commune should have the incontestable right to create, without superior sanction, its own constitution and legislation. But in order to join and become an integral part of the provincial federation, the commune must conform its own particular charter to the fundamental principles of the provincial constitution and be accepted by the parliament of the province. The commune must also accept the judgments of the provincial tribunal and any measures ordered by the government of the province. (All measures of the provincial government must be ratified by the provincial parliament.) Communes refusing to accept the provincial laws will not be entitled to its benefits.\n> * The province must be nothing but a free federation of autonomous communes. The provincial parliament could be composed either of a single chamber with representatives of each of the communes or of two chambers, the other representing the population of the province, independent of the communes. The provincial parliament, without interfering in any manner whatsoever in the internal decisions of the communes will formulate the provincial constitution (based on the principles of this catechism). This constitution must be accepted by all communes wishing to participate in the provincial parliament. The provincial parliament will enact legislation defining the rights and obligations of individuals, communes, and associations in relation to the provincial federation, and the penalties for violations of its laws. It will reserve, however, the right of the communes to diverge on secondary points, though not on fundamentals.\n> * The provincial parliament, in strict accordance with the Charter of the Federation of Communes, will define the rights and obligations existing between the communes, the parliament, the judicial tribunal, and the provincial administration. It will enact all laws affecting the whole province, pass on resolutions or measures of the national parliament, without, however, violating the autonomy of the communes and the province. Without interfering in the internal administration of the communes, it will allot to each commune its share of the provincial or national income, which will be used by the commune as its members decide. The provincial parliament will ratify or reject all policies and measures of the provincial administration which will, of course, be elected by universal suffrage. The provincial tribunal (also elected by universal suffrage) will adjudicate, without appeal, all disputes between communes and individuals, communes and communes, and communes and the provincial administration or parliament. [These arrangements will thus] lead not to dull, lifeless uniformity, but to a real living unity, to the enrichment of communal life. A unity will be created which reflects the needs and aspirations of the communes; in short, we will have individual and collective freedom. This unity cannot be achieved by the compulsion or violence of provincial power, for even truth and justice when coercively imposed must lead to falsehood and iniquity.\n> * The nation must be nothing but a federation of autonomous provinces\n\n**Continued in a reply to this post: The Principles of global federation**", "created_utc": "1665471135.0", "edited": "False", "id": "irv1ijw", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_y10ele", "parent_id": "t3_y10ele", "score": "5", "subreddit": "CapitalismVSocialism", "subreddit_id": "t5_3cct3"}, {"author": "Hoihe", "body": "Not very viable in my case.\n\nI use big and heavy machines that chug helium/argon/hydrogen/acetylene to try and determine things like how much X is in a given medicine.\n\nOr to decide how a new and unknown molecule looks like \n\nA single lamp for a Atom absorption spectrometer costs like 1 000 000 HUF (dunno usd equivalent), and needs replacement every year.", "created_utc": "1665416533.0", "edited": "False", "id": "irrtv4z", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_xzybni", "parent_id": "t1_irrctlx", "score": "2", "subreddit": "LifeProTips", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s5oq"}, {"author": "Hoihe", "body": "I can do my main speciality(enzyme kinetics) from home provided i have access to a powerful supercomputer to run calculations on.\n\nWhich is a lot of money, which my university subsidizes by having it be used by a lot more people than me.\n\nMy sub specialization, structural research, needs very big machines that have an expensive purchase, material and maintenance cost.\n\nA single lab usually receives a sample, processes it for analysis, runs analysis and returns the results to someone who commissioned the analysis.", "created_utc": "1665416360.0", "edited": "False", "id": "irrtfmb", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_xzybni", "parent_id": "t1_irrerqd", "score": "1", "subreddit": "LifeProTips", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s5oq"}, {"author": "Hoihe", "body": "\u00f6szt\u00f6nd\u00edjb\u00f3l \u00faszk\u00e1lok/seg\u00edtem any\u00e1mat.\n\n\u00edgy mikor megkapom oktober/marciusban a dupl\u00e1sat, egy 6 ezret fel tudok adni.", "created_utc": "1665402017.0", "edited": "False", "id": "irr01d0", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_y09bcw", "parent_id": "t1_irqq2iv", "score": "2", "subreddit": "hungary", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qzzt"}, {"author": "Hoihe", "body": "I am amazed this is something hungary is ahead of czechia.\n\nHere if you go private medicine, you can get het after 2 appts.", "created_utc": "1665396646.0", "edited": "False", "id": "irqt0nv", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_xzwoo0", "parent_id": "t3_xzwoo0", "score": "1", "subreddit": "traaaaaaannnnnnnnnns", "subreddit_id": "t5_2uog0"}, {"author": "Hoihe", "body": "Yes.\n\nI dont give a fuck about society.\n\nMy dysphoria is physical and is caused by my body having the wrong hormones and the biological consequences of that.\n\nNo amount of \"abolish gender\" would solve my dysphoria.", "created_utc": "1665396582.0", "edited": "False", "id": "irqsy1p", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_xzwoo0", "parent_id": "t1_irotdi2", "score": "53", "subreddit": "traaaaaaannnnnnnnnns", "subreddit_id": "t5_2uog0"}, {"author": "Hoihe", "body": "What manner of businesses?\n\nIn my field, you need insane amounts of capital to get basic equipment.

The equal right of adolescents, while freely choosing their careers, to be helped and to the greatest possible extent supported by society. After this, society will exercise no authority or supervision over them except to respect, and if necessary defend, their freedom and their rights.\n> 1. The freedom of adults of both sexes must be absolute and complete, freedom to come and go, to voice all opinions, to be lazy or active, moral or immoral, in short, to dispose of one\u2019s person or possessions as one pleases, being accountable to no one. Freedom to live, be it honestly, by one\u2019s own labor, even at the expense of individuals who voluntarily tolerate one\u2019s exploitation.\n> 1. Unlimited freedom of propaganda, speech, press, public or private assembly, with no other restraint than the natural salutary power of public opinion. Absolute freedom to organize associations even for allegedly immoral purposes including even those associations which advocate the undermining (or destruction) of individual and public freedom.\n> 1. Freedom can and must be defended only by freedom: to advocate the restriction of freedom on the pretext that it is being defended is a dangerous delusion. As morality has no other source, no other object, no other stimulant than freedom, all restrictions of liberty in order to protect morality have always been to the detriment of the latter. Psychology, statistics, and all history prove that individual and social immorality are the inevitable consequences of a false private and public education, of the degeneration of public morality and the corruption of public opinion, and above all, of. the vicious organization of society. An eminent Belgian statistician [Qu\u00e9telet] points out that society opens the way for the crimes later committed by malefactors. It follows that all attempts to combat social immorality by rigorous legislation which violates individual freedom must fail. Experience, on the contrary, demonstrates that a repressive and authoritarian system, far from preventing, only increases crime; that public and private morality falls or rises to the extent that individual liberty is restricted or enlarged. It follows that in order to regenerate society, we must first completely uproot this political and social system founded on inequality, privilege, and contempt for humanity. After having reconstructed society on the basis of the most complete liberty, equality, and justice \u2014 not to mention work \u2014 for all and an enlightened education inspired by respect for man \u2014 public opinion will then reflect the new humanity and become a natural guardian of the most absolute liberty [and public order. Ed.].\n> 1. Society cannot, however, leave itself completely defenseless against vicious and parasitic individuals. Work must be the basis of all political rights. The units of society, each within its own jurisdiction, can deprive all such antisocial adults of political rights (except the old, the sick, and those dependent on private or public subsidy) and will be obliged to restore their political rights as soon as they begin to live by their own labor.\n> 1. The liberty of every human being is inalienable and society will never require any individual to surrender his liberty or to sign contracts with other individuals except on the basis of the most complete equality and reciprocity. Society cannot forcibly prevent any man or woman so devoid of personal dignity as to place him- or herself in voluntary servitude to another individual; but it can justly treat such persons as parasites, not entitled to the enjoyment of political liberty, though only for the duration of their servitude.\n> 1. Persons losing their political rights will also lose custody of their children. Persons who violate voluntary agreements, steal, inflict bodily harm, or above all, violate the freedom of any individual, native or foreigner, will be penalized according to the laws of society.\n> 1. Individuals condemned by the laws of any and every association (commune, province, region, or nation) reserve the right to escape punishment by declaring that they wish to resign from that association. But in this case, the association will have the equal right to expel him and declare him outside its guarantee and protection.\n\n\nThese rights build on each other.

It is supported by:\n\nTheory of Justice, surmized (Pillars of Liberty):\n\n> 1. At birth, everyone has an equal ability to achieve any given outcome (which neatly rules out a lot of the racist, sexist, etc 'I'd be happy as an underclass')\n> 2. Any inequality in outcome must be of benefit to all members in a system -- not come at the expense of the 'less fortunate' member.\n> 3. Society must be designed according to the Original Position. \n\nOriginal Position: Imagine everyone in society, before being born, sit upon a round table. There, they do not know what their parents will be, what their sex, gender, orientation, intelligence, wealth will be. They will not know if they will be aristocracy or serf, native or foreign.\n\nAt this round table, everyone is selfish, and desires maximum guarantee that no matter who they will be, their life will be a good life. As such, logically they arrive at the formulation of Individualism declared earlier.\n\nWhen organization fails to reproduce the Original Position, we evaluate all future adjustments, changes according to how they move us closer to its logical conclusion. Societal changes that reduce the power of Family, Community and Church are positive. Societal changes that introduce discrimination are negative.\n\n\n\nAlternatively, one can examine Bakunin's Revolutionary Catechism for Anarchist though, which proclaims the following individual rights which must be observed at all times:\n\n> 1. The right of every man and woman, from birth to adulthood, to complete upkeep, clothes, food, shelter, care, guidance, education (public schools, primary, secondary, higher education, artistic, industrial, and scientific), all at the expense of society.\n> 1.

After having reconstructed society on the basis of the most complete liberty, equality, and justice \u2014 not to mention work \u2014 for all and an enlightened education inspired by respect for man \u2014 public opinion will then reflect the new humanity and become a natural guardian of the most absolute liberty [and public order. Ed.].\n> 1. Society cannot, however, leave itself completely defenseless against vicious and parasitic individuals. Work must be the basis of all political rights. The units of society, each within its own jurisdiction, can deprive all such antisocial adults of political rights (except the old, the sick, and those dependent on private or public subsidy) and will be obliged to restore their political rights as soon as they begin to live by their own labor.\n> 1. The liberty of every human being is inalienable and society will never require any individual to surrender his liberty or to sign contracts with other individuals except on the basis of the most complete equality and reciprocity. Society cannot forcibly prevent any man or woman so devoid of personal dignity as to place him- or herself in voluntary servitude to another individual; but it can justly treat such persons as parasites, not entitled to the enjoyment of political liberty, though only for the duration of their servitude.\n> 1. Persons losing their political rights will also lose custody of their children. Persons who violate voluntary agreements, steal, inflict bodily harm, or above all, violate the freedom of any individual, native or foreigner, will be penalized according to the laws of society.\n> 1. Individuals condemned by the laws of any and every association (commune, province, region, or nation) reserve the right to escape punishment by declaring that they wish to resign from that association. But in this case, the association will have the equal right to expel him and declare him outside its guarantee and protection.\n\n\nThese rights build on each other. Right 1 takes precedent over right 3 and so forth.\n\nAs I've ran out of characters - I will note that the Catechism goes to great lengths detailing the rights of children and their liberty to self-determine even against parental influence.", "created_utc": "1665233827.0", "edited": "False", "id": "irif5e9", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_xx0pv8", "parent_id": "t1_iridbrg", "score": "-1", "subreddit": "changemyview", "subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8"}, {"author": "Hoihe", "body": "The individualist will explicitly argue you ARE entitled to resources.\n\n> For individualism to exist, the following must be true:\n> \n> **\\0.

(2017), \"A revision of Hofstede\u2019s individualism-collectivism dimension: A new national index from a 56-country study\", Cross Cultural & Strategic Management, Vol. 24 No. 3, pp. 386-404. https://doi.org/10.1108/CCSM-11-2016-0197\n\nAs for how they define collectivism:\n\n> Thus, a key element of IDV-COLL differences is general societal\n> freedom versus general societal restriction or restrictiveness for the\n> sake of conformism.

They make schooling unaffordable. They make childcare unaffordable. Healthcare. Housing.\n\nOnce collectivists stripped you of welfare and all that, your only way of survival becomes going back to your family who dictates who you can love and what you can work. Failing that, you have the church who will only help you if you live as a good christian woman.\n\nTrue Individualists fight for welfare, for universal healthcare and free education.

A collectivist is not some great supporter of welfare systems.\n\nCollectivism means you have strict social rules which you use to determine who is worthy and who isn't of your support. Collectivists are usually of the heavily capitalistic sort, who argue against welfare systems (since they are universal and people they don't approve of also get help), and instead argue for \"bootstraps\" and church/charity.\n\nIndividualists advocate for universal social safety nets and welfare systems, since those are not dependent on social harmony to receive. Even if your whole village despise you for being different, you're still getting your monthly disability pension.\n\n\nAs for why is this a thing? Survival.\n\n> Thus, a key element of IDV-COLL differences is general societal freedom versus general societal restriction or restrictiveness for the sake of conformism. In IDV societies, people are allowed \"to do their own thing\" (Triandis, 1993, p. 159) but in COLL ones, individuals' choices - such as selection of a spouse or a professional career - are often made for them by others, usually senior family members or community elders. Individuals often have no other choice than to conform to the societal rule that dictates obedience and avoid engaging in a costly conflict.\n> \n> Obedience and conformism may sound like alarming societal characteristics. Conflict avoidance also seems reprehensible from an IDV perspective if it involves submission and acceptance of a lose-win solution: \"lose\" for the individual, \"win\" for society. But these COLL characteristics do not exist for their own sake. COLL communities would have difficulty surviving without conformism and submission. Libertarians whose views and behaviors are not aligned with those of the mainstream could have a devastating effect on in-group cohesion.\n> \n> COLL societies cannot allow too much individual freedom, conflict, and divergence from tradition lest they lose their cohesiveness and harmony, and fall apart. In an economically poor environment, if individuals were left to their own devices, many would not survive. For the same reason, COLL societies emphasize hierarchy and power distance. The social fabric must be preserved in its tightly-knit original, either voluntarily or by force. Somebody must have unchallengeable authority to quell dissent.\n\nMinkov, M., Dutt, P., Schachner, M., Morales, O., Sanchez, C., Jandosova, J., Khassenbekov, Y. and Mudd, B.

The circumstances of birth are minimized, ideally removed. One's nationality, ethnicity, parentage/pedigree, neurotype, gender, sex, sexual/romantic orientation should NOT determine one's opportunities in life.** \n> \n> This is achieved through \n> \n> * opening borders (ethnicity, nationality)\n> * free access to quality education, extra-curricular programs, food and shelter as children (welfare, public healthcare, public education (my preferred form is the Austrian, where the child can decide on what they wish to study and attend any school anywhere regardless of parental wealth) (parentage/pedigree)\n> * Abolishment of gender roles (gender/sex circumstances)\n> * Anti-discrimination laws (gender, sex, orientation circumstances)\n> * Screening for neurodivergences, and resources dedicated to accomodate people's impairments so they do not become disabilities while recognizing they are just as intelligent and capable (ADHD kids allowed to have the right amount of stimulation, autistic folk allowed to study through reading over sitting in lectures with consultations, that kind of thing)\n> \n> **\\1. People should be capable of fulfilling their cultural, ethnic, religious, gender, romantic/sexual identities without it negatively affecting their ability to survive.** \n> \n> Caveats:\n> \n> * If fulfilment of identity requires \"traditional gender roles\" for your wife, it can ONLY be done as long as those participating consent (where consent is NOT coerced, ACTIVELY given. Meaning, adult with adult, children cannot be forced into traditional gender roles. Your wife can always stop consenting, and divorce you without justification.)\n> * If fulfilment of identity requires restricting another person's ability to fulfil their own in a reasonable manner. Ergo - having a transgender co-worker in a laboratory does not limit your ability to fulfil your christian identity. Not being able to get hired because you're trans or a sikh DOES limit your ability to fulfil your gender/religious identity. If your religious identity requires the murder of LGBT people, then being barred from murdering them is an acceptable sacrifice of your liberty we can make.\n> \n> **\\2. People should have their basic needs (healthcare, shelter, basic nutrition, privacy) guaranteed regardless of ability to work or socialize or fit in.**\n> \n> **\\3. People MUST have an ADEQUATE access to pursuing intellectual, athletic, cultural and social activities.**\n> \n> * Adequate: Must have free time to do so. For a minimum requirement, we can achieve this through maximizing monthly working hours at 160 hours a month and minimum 25 days paid time off.\n> * Adequate: Must have a way to choose what they want.

Outside of my workplace/university and close friends (who have been fortunate enough to move to Western Europe already), interacting face-to-face with people is too risky for my blood. I've already faced threats of violence for simply existing on the train by my bigoted countrymen.\n\n\nWith all of the above - one wonders how I could fulfil my social need if face-to-face interaction is uncomfortable, strenuous AND dangerous at the same time. Simple! Digital means of communication: Discord, IRC, hobbyist forums and small-time subreddits. My difficulties regarding verbal communication evaporate when I have the opportunity to type - no more body language being misinterpreted by either me or my communication partner, no more weird pitch modulation or slurring words together, no more being unable to hear what someone says due to absence of competent sensory filtration or mismanagement of attention - typing and reading solves all of this! Furthermore, bigots can't stab me if I'm staying home.\n\nAnd so - I will pick being on my phone over talking to strangers or even friends in public spaces. I'll speak to friends in a shared public space over discord. I'll hang out with friends who moved abroad through digital spaces.\n\nTurns out - I'm not introverted. I'm quite social in fact! I just need a different space and medium to pursue my social needs.", "created_utc": "1664982573.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ir5pr24", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_xvpaay", "parent_id": "t1_ir2tnjw", "score": "1", "subreddit": "NoStupidQuestions", "subreddit_id": "t5_2w844"}, {"author": "Hoihe", "body": "It exists in my country.\n\nhttps://semmelweis.hu/aok/oktatas/\n\n6 year degree you apply to after graduating high school.

It is collectivist.\n\n\nLogic explains that, individualism:\n\n> For individualism to exist, the following must be true:\n> \n> **\\0. The circumstances of birth are minimized, ideally removed. One's nationality, ethnicity, parentage/pedigree, neurotype, gender, sex, sexual/romantic orientation should NOT determine one's opportunities in life.** \n> \n> This is achieved through \n> \n> * opening borders (ethnicity, nationality)\n> * free access to quality education, extra-curricular programs, food and shelter as children (welfare, public healthcare, public education (my preferred form is the Austrian, where the child can decide on what they wish to study and attend any school anywhere regardless of parental wealth) (parentage/pedigree)\n> * Abolishment of gender roles (gender/sex circumstances)\n> * Anti-discrimination laws (gender, sex, orientation circumstances)\n> * Screening for neurodivergences, and resources dedicated to accomodate people's impairments so they do not become disabilities while recognizing they are just as intelligent and capable (ADHD kids allowed to have the right amount of stimulation, autistic folk allowed to study through reading over sitting in lectures with consultations, that kind of thing)\n> \n> **\\1. People should be capable of fulfilling their cultural, ethnic, religious, gender, romantic/sexual identities without it negatively affecting their ability to survive.** \n> \n> Caveats:\n> \n> * If fulfilment of identity requires \"traditional gender roles\" for your wife, it can ONLY be done as long as those participating consent (where consent is NOT coerced, ACTIVELY given. Meaning, adult with adult, children cannot be forced into traditional gender roles. Your wife can always stop consenting, and divorce you without justification.)\n> * If fulfilment of identity requires restricting another person's ability to fulfil their own in a reasonable manner. Ergo - having a transgender co-worker in a laboratory does not limit your ability to fulfil your christian identity. Not being able to get hired because you're trans or a sikh DOES limit your ability to fulfil your gender/religious identity. If your religious identity requires the murder of LGBT people, then being barred from murdering them is an acceptable sacrifice of your liberty we can make.\n> \n> **\\2. People should have their basic needs (healthcare, shelter, basic nutrition, privacy) guaranteed regardless of ability to work or socialize or fit in.**\n> \n> **\\3. People MUST have an ADEQUATE access to pursuing intellectual, athletic, cultural and social activities.**\n> \n> * Adequate: Must have free time to do so. For a minimum requirement, we can achieve this through maximizing monthly working hours at 160 hours a month and minimum 25 days paid time off.\n> * Adequate: Must have a way to choose what they want. This can be labour voucher, money, whatever. It should not be decided for them\n> * Adequate: Using whatever representation of value, they should have enough working even a part time job with disabilities to seek personal fulfilment (maybe they won't be able to afford a schooner to pursue historical re-enaction and living history research as a private person, but they can buy books about boats and afford computer simulations, attend a club where they collectively own a schooner for re-enactment).\n\n\nFurther, one can examine the Revolutionary Catechism by  Bakunin, or the Theory of Justice by Rawls to arrive at the same conclusion.\n\nThe above formulation of individualism is my own. It is supported by:\n\nTheory of Justice, surmized (Pillars of Liberty):\n\n> 1. At birth, everyone has an equal ability to achieve any given outcome (which neatly rules out a lot of the racist, sexist, etc 'I'd be happy as an underclass')\n> 2. Any inequality in outcome must be of benefit to all members in a system -- not come at the expense of the 'less fortunate' member.\n> 3. Society must be designed according to the Original Position. \n\nOriginal Position: Imagine everyone in society, before being born, sit upon a round table. There, they do not know what their parents will be, what their sex, gender, orientation, intelligence, wealth will be. They will not know if they will be aristocracy or serf, native or foreign.\n\nAt this round table, everyone is selfish, and desires maximum guarantee that no matter who they will be, their life will be a good life. As such, logically they arrive at the formulation of Individualism declared earlier.\n\nWhen organization fails to reproduce the Original Position, we evaluate all future adjustments, changes according to how they move us closer to its logical conclusion. Societal changes that reduce the power of Family, Community and Church are positive. Societal changes that introduce discrimination are negative.\n\n\n\nAlternatively, one can examine Bakunin's Revolutionary Catechism for Anarchist though, which proclaims the following individual rights which must be observed at all times:\n\n> 1. The right of every man and woman, from birth to adulthood, to complete upkeep, clothes, food, shelter, care, guidance, education (public schools, primary, secondary, higher education, artistic, industrial, and scientific), all at the expense of society.\n> 1. The equal right of adolescents, while freely choosing their careers, to be helped and to the greatest possible extent supported by society. After this, society will exercise no authority or supervision over them except to respect, and if necessary defend, their freedom and their rights.\n> 1. The freedom of adults of both sexes must be absolute and complete, freedom to come and go, to voice all opinions, to be lazy or active, moral or immoral, in short, to dispose of one\u2019s person or possessions as one pleases, being accountable to no one. Freedom to live, be it honestly, by one\u2019s own labor, even at the expense of individuals who voluntarily tolerate one\u2019s exploitation.\n> 1. Unlimited freedom of propaganda, speech, press, public or private assembly, with no other restraint than the natural salutary power of public opinion. Absolute freedom to organize associations even for allegedly immoral purposes including even those associations which advocate the undermining (or destruction) of individual and public freedom.\n> 1. Freedom can and must be defended only by freedom: to advocate the restriction of freedom on the pretext that it is being defended is a dangerous delusion. As morality has no other source, no other object, no other stimulant than freedom, all restrictions of liberty in order to protect morality have always been to the detriment of the latter. Psychology, statistics, and all history prove that individual and social immorality are the inevitable consequences of a false private and public education, of the degeneration of public morality and the corruption of public opinion, and above all, of. the vicious organization of society. An eminent Belgian statistician [Qu\u00e9telet] points out that society opens the way for the crimes later committed by malefactors. It follows that all attempts to combat social immorality by rigorous legislation which violates individual freedom must fail. Experience, on the contrary, demonstrates that a repressive and authoritarian system, far from preventing, only increases crime; that public and private morality falls or rises to the extent that individual liberty is restricted or enlarged. It follows that in order to regenerate society, we must first completely uproot this political and social system founded on inequality, privilege, and contempt for humanity. After having reconstructed society on the basis of the most complete liberty, equality, and justice \u2014 not to mention work \u2014 for all and an enlightened education inspired by respect for man \u2014 public opinion will then reflect the new humanity and become a natural guardian of the most absolute liberty [and public order. Ed.].\n> 1. Society cannot, however, leave itself completely defenseless against vicious and parasitic individuals. Work must be the basis of all political rights. The units of society, each within its own jurisdiction, can deprive all such antisocial adults of political rights (except the old, the sick, and those dependent on private or public subsidy) and will be obliged to restore their political rights as soon as they begin to live by their own labor.\n> 1. The liberty of every human being is inalienable and society will never require any individual to surrender his liberty or to sign contracts with other individuals except on the basis of the most complete equality and reciprocity. Society cannot forcibly prevent any man or woman so devoid of personal dignity as to place him- or herself in voluntary servitude to another individual; but it can justly treat such persons as parasites, not entitled to the enjoyment of political liberty, though only for the duration of their servitude.\n> 1. Persons losing their political rights will also lose custody of their children. Persons who violate voluntary agreements, steal, inflict bodily harm, or above all, violate the freedom of any individual, native or foreigner, will be penalized according to the laws of society.\n> 1. Individuals condemned by the laws of any and every association (commune, province, region, or nation) reserve the right to escape punishment by declaring that they wish to resign from that association. But in this case, the association will have the equal right to expel him and declare him outside its guarantee and protection.\n\n\nThese rights build on each other. Right 1 takes precedent over right 3 and so forth.\n\nAs I've ran out of characters - I will note that the Catechism goes to great lengths detailing the rights of children and their liberty to self-determine even against parental influence.", "created_utc": "1664794587.0", "edited": "False", "id": "iqv9x9c", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_xu35p4", "parent_id": "t1_iqulyui", "score": "0", "subreddit": "GirlGamers", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rfec"}, {"author": "Hoihe", "body": "Trust me marxism is just as obsessed with status if not more so.\n\nMy country is formerly marxist and people go out of their way to sabotave other people's advancements to prop their own status up.\n\nBoth marxism and capitalism are horrible systems.\n\nBakunin's social anarchy is infinitely better than both.

The circumstances of birth are minimized, ideally removed. One's nationality, ethnicity, parentage/pedigree, neurotype, gender, sex, sexual/romantic orientation should NOT determine one's opportunities in life.** \n> \n> This is achieved through \n> \n> * opening borders (ethnicity, nationality)\n> * free access to quality education, extra-curricular programs, food and shelter as children (welfare, public healthcare, public education (my preferred form is the Austrian, where the child can decide on what they wish to study and attend any school anywhere regardless of parental wealth) (parentage/pedigree)\n> * Abolishment of gender roles (gender/sex circumstances)\n> * Anti-discrimination laws (gender, sex, orientation circumstances)\n> * Screening for neurodivergences, and resources dedicated to accomodate people's impairments so they do not become disabilities while recognizing they are just as intelligent and capable (ADHD kids allowed to have the right amount of stimulation, autistic folk allowed to study through reading over sitting in lectures with consultations, that kind of thing)\n> \n> **\\1. People should be capable of fulfilling their cultural, ethnic, religious, gender, romantic/sexual identities without it negatively affecting their ability to survive.** \n> \n> Caveats:\n> \n> * If fulfilment of identity requires \"traditional gender roles\" for your wife, it can ONLY be done as long as those participating consent (where consent is NOT coerced, ACTIVELY given. Meaning, adult with adult, children cannot be forced into traditional gender roles. Your wife can always stop consenting, and divorce you without justification.)\n> * If fulfilment of identity requires restricting another person's ability to fulfil their own in a reasonable manner. Ergo - having a transgender co-worker in a laboratory does not limit your ability to fulfil your christian identity. Not being able to get hired because you're trans or a sikh DOES limit your ability to fulfil your gender/religious identity. If your religious identity requires the murder of LGBT people, then being barred from murdering them is an acceptable sacrifice of your liberty we can make.\n> \n> **\\2. People should have their basic needs (healthcare, shelter, basic nutrition, privacy) guaranteed regardless of ability to work or socialize or fit in.**\n> \n> **\\3. People MUST have an ADEQUATE access to pursuing intellectual, athletic, cultural and social activities.**\n> \n> * Adequate: Must have free time to do so. For a minimum requirement, we can achieve this through maximizing monthly working hours at 160 hours a month and minimum 25 days paid time off.\n> * Adequate: Must have a way to choose what they want. This can be labour voucher, money, whatever. It should not be decided for them\n> * Adequate: Using whatever representation of value, they should have enough working even a part time job with disabilities to seek personal fulfilment (maybe they won't be able to afford a schooner to pursue historical re-enaction and living history research as a private person, but they can buy books about boats and afford computer simulations, attend a club where they collectively own a schooner for re-enactment).\n\n\nFurther, one can examine the Revolutionary Catechism by  Bakunin, or the Theory of Justice by Rawls to arrive at the same conclusion.\n\nThe above formulation of individualism is my own. It is supported by:\n\nTheory of Justice, surmized (Pillars of Liberty):\n\n> 1. At birth, everyone has an equal ability to achieve any given outcome (which neatly rules out a lot of the racist, sexist, etc 'I'd be happy as an underclass')\n> 2. Any inequality in outcome must be of benefit to all members in a system -- not come at the expense of the 'less fortunate' member.\n> 3. Society must be designed according to the Original Position. \n\nOriginal Position: Imagine everyone in society, before being born, sit upon a round table. There, they do not know what their parents will be, what their sex, gender, orientation, intelligence, wealth will be. They will not know if they will be aristocracy or serf, native or foreign.\n\nAt this round table, everyone is selfish, and desires maximum guarantee that no matter who they will be, their life will be a good life. As such, logically they arrive at the formulation of Individualism declared earlier.\n\nWhen organization fails to reproduce the Original Position, we evaluate all future adjustments, changes according to how they move us closer to its logical conclusion. Societal changes that reduce the power of Family, Community and Church are positive. Societal changes that introduce discrimination are negative.\n\n\n\nAlternatively, one can examine Bakunin's Revolutionary Catechism for Anarchist though, which proclaims the following individual rights which must be observed at all times:\n\n> 1. The right of every man and woman, from birth to adulthood, to complete upkeep, clothes, food, shelter, care, guidance, education (public schools, primary, secondary, higher education, artistic, industrial, and scientific), all at the expense of society.\n> 1. The equal right of adolescents, while freely choosing their careers, to be helped and to the greatest possible extent supported by society. After this, society will exercise no authority or supervision over them except to respect, and if necessary defend, their freedom and their rights.\n> 1. The freedom of adults of both sexes must be absolute and complete, freedom to come and go, to voice all opinions, to be lazy or active, moral or immoral, in short, to dispose of one\u2019s person or possessions as one pleases, being accountable to no one. Freedom to live, be it honestly, by one\u2019s own labor, even at the expense of individuals who voluntarily tolerate one\u2019s exploitation.\n> 1. Unlimited freedom of propaganda, speech, press, public or private assembly, with no other restraint than the natural salutary power of public opinion. Absolute freedom to organize associations even for allegedly immoral purposes including even those associations which advocate the undermining (or destruction) of individual and public freedom.\n> 1. Freedom can and must be defended only by freedom: to advocate the restriction of freedom on the pretext that it is being defended is a dangerous delusion. As morality has no other source, no other object, no other stimulant than freedom, all restrictions of liberty in order to protect morality have always been to the detriment of the latter. Psychology, statistics, and all history prove that individual and social immorality are the inevitable consequences of a false private and public education, of the degeneration of public morality and the corruption of public opinion, and above all, of. the vicious organization of society. An eminent Belgian statistician [Qu\u00e9telet] points out that society opens the way for the crimes later committed by malefactors. It follows that all attempts to combat social immorality by rigorous legislation which violates individual freedom must fail. Experience, on the contrary, demonstrates that a repressive and authoritarian system, far from preventing, only increases crime; that public and private morality falls or rises to the extent that individual liberty is restricted or enlarged. It follows that in order to regenerate society, we must first completely uproot this political and social system founded on inequality, privilege, and contempt for humanity. After having reconstructed society on the basis of the most complete liberty, equality, and justice \u2014 not to mention work \u2014 for all and an enlightened education inspired by respect for man \u2014 public opinion will then reflect the new humanity and become a natural guardian of the most absolute liberty [and public order. Ed.].\n> 1. Society cannot, however, leave itself completely defenseless against vicious and parasitic individuals. Work must be the basis of all political rights. The units of society, each within its own jurisdiction, can deprive all such antisocial adults of political rights (except the old, the sick, and those dependent on private or public subsidy) and will be obliged to restore their political rights as soon as they begin to live by their own labor.\n> 1. The liberty of every human being is inalienable and society will never require any individual to surrender his liberty or to sign contracts with other individuals except on the basis of the most complete equality and reciprocity. Society cannot forcibly prevent any man or woman so devoid of personal dignity as to place him- or herself in voluntary servitude to another individual; but it can justly treat such persons as parasites, not entitled to the enjoyment of political liberty, though only for the duration of their servitude.\n> 1. Persons losing their political rights will also lose custody of their children. Persons who violate voluntary agreements, steal, inflict bodily harm, or above all, violate the freedom of any individual, native or foreigner, will be penalized according to the laws of society.\n> 1. Individuals condemned by the laws of any and every association (commune, province, region, or nation) reserve the right to escape punishment by declaring that they wish to resign from that association. But in this case, the association will have the equal right to expel him and declare him outside its guarantee and protection.\n\n\nThese rights build on each other.

Individuals often have no other choice than to\n> conform to the societal rule that dictates obedience and avoid\n> engaging in a costly conflict. \n>\n> Obedience and conformism may sound like alarming societal\n> characteristics. Conflict avoidance also seems reprehensible from an\n> IDV perspective if it involves submission and acceptance of a lose-win\n> solution: \"lose\" for the individual, \"win\" for society. But these COLL\n> characteristics do not exist for their own sake. COLL communities\n> would have difficulty surviving without conformism and submission.\n> Libertarians whose views and behaviors are not aligned with those of\n> the mainstream could have a devastating effect on in-group cohesion.\n> \n> COLL societies cannot allow too much individual freedom, conflict, and\n> divergence from tradition lest they lose their cohesiveness and\n> harmony, and fall apart. In an economically poor environment, if\n> individuals were left to their own devices, many would not survive.\n> For the same reason, COLL societies emphasize hierarchy and power\n> distance. The social fabric must be preserved in its tightly-knit\n> original, either voluntarily or by force.

It is a complex term which we can split into 2 simpler constituents that also have the word, \"gender\" within them complicating things.\n\nLet's start with **constituent A - Social Gender Identity.** Social Gender is what feminism refers to when its proponents say, \"Gender is a social construct!\" (which i agree with). \n\nSocial gender is something arbitrary that society decided to impose upon its members based on their genitalia, sexual phenotype and/or sexual orientation.\n\nWithin social gender we can find the concepts of dress codes, acceptable emotional expressions, behaviour policing, jobs you are (not) allowed to do, your rights and duties and so forth. (Almost) All of this is arbtirary, and if you go to another culture - may change completely. Sometimes you don't even need to go far, just move from a rural village to the capital to experience a drastic change in what it means to be a woman (in my village, people consider being a scientist a male job and look at women weird for going to univ rather than having children, whereas my university in Hungary's capital is full of scholarships encouraging women to get into science).\n\nNow, Autistic people are often described in pop science articles as \"lacking\" an innate understanding of social constructs, which i can sorta identify with! Thus, if we accept this as true - then it makes sense that for those of us whose brains are wired differently, the whole arbitrary idea of social gender with all its unjustified and random rules feel wrong, alien and \"hard to understand.\"\n\nNow, this could mean autistic people have a large number of non-binary/agender individuals. Or it could just make the community gender non-conforming. The only good thing about social gender - because of how utterly random and arbitrary it is - self ID is not only valid: it's encouraged! As such, I self ID as \"Gender non-conforming woman (by standards of rural Hungary)\" It's something of a tongue-in-cheek self ID for me, as I am tired of people telling me I can't be a woman if I like sword fighting and science and maths.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut there's another component to gender I havn't mentioned yet, and something as a neuroscientist may find interesting! \nThe 2 most up to date papers I base this upon:  \nhttps://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-17352-8  (2017)  \nhttps://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-80687-2  (2021)  \n\nThere's more than these two, but these two in particular approached the question by controlling for sexual orientation and ignored social biases like maths skills or language skills. Or rather: They controlled for them. \n\nControlling for all that, these papers found that the brains of transgender individuals differed from those of cisgender individuals. *For sake of not being an unwilling advocate for transmedicalists: This paper focuses on those transgender individuals with \"Physical dysphoria\", and those trans people who are entirely based on the social gender are completely valid.* With that out of the way: \n\nThe 2017 paper found that transgender people show differences in brain regions corresponding to how the individual perceives their own body, regions that create a sense of \"Ownership\" over one's own body. The 2021 paper found that if a transgender person starts to medically transition using hormone replacement therapy, these differences reduce. Taking karyotpe-approrpiate (so estrogen for FTM, testosterone for MTF) did NOT provide improvements, in fact cisgender people taking hormones experienced neural degradation. \n\nThe 2021 paper proposed 2 mechanisms (but it was out of scope to decide which is the real one, but they admitted it could be both) as such:  \n**Mechanism 1:**    \nCross-sex hormones directly interact with neural structures, strengthening the weakened connections.  \n**Mechanism 2:**    \nBy having the body look more like, AND function more like the brain expects it to - these weakened structures strengthen in kind of a feedback loop mumbo jumbo.\n\n\nAs such, we arrive to **Constituent B - Internal Gender Identity/Neural Gender**. Neural Gender is thus defined: A particular sexual phenotype (either binary male or female, or in between) that the brain expects the body to possess after puberty finishes. This includes gonads, endocrine levels and primary & secondary sex characteristics. Any deviation from what the brain expects creates either a direct sense of distress, or a dull pain that is only recognized once eased (in other words: dysphoria). \n\nChances are, if you do not feel any acute sense of distress in regards to your sexual characteristics, and the idea of altering them (including your hormonal make up) does not make you feel you would experience an improvement of mental health, then your neural gender is aligned with your sexual phenotype. \n\nThis does NOT mean you cannot be trans. It just means that if you do not particularly feel attached to the social gender that is \"Woman\" in western (post)-Christian society, it does not mean you are not allowed to call yourself a woman.\n\n\n\nTo be transgender, one of the following must be true:\nYour Social Gender Identity differs from what society assigns to your sexual phenotype & sexual orientation   \n**INCLUSIVE OR**  \nYour Internal Gender Identity differs at least in one component (not necessarily ALL components - you are totally valid if you only feel dysphoric due to hormonal stuff and don't want beard or whatever) from the sexual phenotype your body expressed through puberty.\n\n\n\nPersonally, I have a fairly strong overlap of my internal gender identity's expectations with that of the typical human female sexual phenotype, and as such I am pursuing medical transition to achieve that. As a consequence, I identify as a woman.\n\nHowever, I also lack a particularly strong attachment towards any particular social gender identity, bar a few specifics (name, address, culturally influenced idea of how a woman must look like [Long hair, smooth skin under the neck]). I still identify as a woman though, as I place more weight (Personally) on my internal gender identity && I am a feminist, so I reject many of the things my country assigns to women in terms of duties and behaviour and whatnot.\n\n\n\n\n\nHope it helps!", "created_utc": "1664503389.0", "edited": "False", "id": "iqg4pml", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_xrj1k0", "parent_id": "t1_iqg38c1", "score": "9", "subreddit": "PublicFreakout", "subreddit_id": "t5_2yrq6"}, {"author": "Hoihe", "body": "Non binary fit perfectly.\n\nLemme grab the thing from my desktop", "created_utc": "1664503307.0", "edited": "False", "id": "iqg4iyp", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_xrj1k0", "parent_id": "t1_iqg38c1", "score": "6", "subreddit": "PublicFreakout", "subreddit_id": "t5_2yrq6"}, {"author": "Hoihe", "body": "Gender identity isnt subjective.\n\nThat is why we trans people transition.

We can witness this in various subcultures (The concept of \"tomboys\" and \"butch lesbians\", a woman who dresses and behaves as a man traditionally should) (Identity and Expression clashing). \n\nThe idea of \"I'm a man, so I don't wear a skirt\" pertains not to gender identity, but gender expression. Potentially, to your gender role as a way to advertise what role in society you fulfil by dressing the part. However, being a man does not dictate you cannot wear a skirt.\n\n\n\n**For Intrinsic gender identity itself, I'll depart from social science and onto neuropsychology.**\n\n\n\n*Burke et al (2017)* found was found that after controlling for sexual/romantic orientation, culture, etc... there exist a difference between transgender people (with physical dysphoria, before transitioning medically) and cisgender people when it comes to neural structures.\n\nThese differences manifest primarily in neuro-motor regions, regions corresponding for sensory processing. Basically, places where the brain communicates with the body. \n\nThe differences are that these regions appear \"underdeveloped\", as if not being exercised.\n\nIt's not \"male brain\" or \"female brain\", it's \"my brain doesn't get the responses from my body that it expects\" vs \"my body looks and behaves like my brain expects.\"\n\n*Khorashad et al (2021)* later investigated these findings, finding that these neural differences disappear upon taking gender-confirming cross-sex hormonal therapy. Or at the very least, minimize. \n\nMeaning, it appears that the weakened connections become exercised and reinforced.\n\nThis explains why trans people who have medically transitioned no longer exhibit these patterns, and also tracks with reports of gender dysphoria easing over time even though the person does not culturally/socially pass.\n\n**Two methods of action are proposed:**\n\na) body feels and behaves as the brain's \"internal blueprint\" expects it to: hormone levels are correct, the proper genes are expressed now, the right proteins and shape and function.\n\nJust like doing exercises reinforces neural pathways, so does the body responding like the brain expects it to does the same.\n\nb) Hormones directly bind with hormone receptors in the brain, encouraging the formation of new neural structures.\n\nB would explain what some trans people call \"hormonal/endocrine dysphoria.\" Or rather the euphoria from being on hormones even before physical changes set in.\n\nThe two mechanisms proposed are not exclusive, but yet to be determined.\n\n\nBurke, S.M., Manzouri, A.H. & Savic, I.

Sexual differentiation of the human brain in relation to gender identity and sexual orientation. Functional Neurology, 24(1), 17\u201328. https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0805542105\n\nIn this cited paper, Swaab et al studied people with a condition known as Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome. Androgen Insensitivty syndrome causes testosterone (and other androgen) hormones to have failure binding to their appropriate receptors, or for those receptors to provide a lesser signal than they should.\n\nThe consequence of AAS can range from underdeveloped testes and penis with gynecomastia to having a vagina with gonads that are neither testicles nor ovaries.\n\nIt has been found by Swaab et al that depending on which specific androgens are blocked, gender identity varies: Total AAS led to a person to become a cisgender intersex woman, whereas partial AAS led to a transgender intersex man.\n\nBy observing this, Swaab et al demonstrate that gender identity is likely controlled by how the brain interacts with hormone levels during foetal and perhaps early childhood development, independent of nurture. This can be caused by less-extreme forms of genetic disorders that affects hormone processing, and it's also possible for such disorders to be \"localized\" - the genes are there, working... but the other genes regulating the expression of the genes regulating testosterone receptor proteins might be locally dysfunctional, causing too much/too little exposure, affecting gender identity.\n\n********\n\n\n**As seen above, gender identity is intrinsic to the individual and cannot be changed. What about sex? Well - let's consider what sexual dimorphism actually is!**\n\n\n********\n\none can read any Graduate level biology textbook regarding human sexual dimorphism. There, they would learn that gonadal differentiation is initiated by the SRY gene on the Y chromosome. This singular gene determines if your gonads develop into ovaries or testicles. The rest of the Y chromosome acts to regulate the function of testicles, and to assist in its healthy development.\n\nThe rest of human sexual differentiation is initiated by the gonads themselves - gonads produce sex hormones: estrogens, androgens and progesterons. These estrogens, androgens and progesterons then bind with their respective receptors (which, barring androgen receptors - which are found on the X chromosome - are found scattered on 6 and 14 and 17 somatic chromosomes. Somatic chromosomes are the same in men and women), altering gene expression.\n\nThis altered gene expression is drawn primarily from somatic chromosomes, and is found in both men and women.\n\nHuman sexual differentiation, therefore - using graduate level biology:\n\nPresence or absence of SRY gene decides if you get testicles or ovaries\nOvaries/Testicles develop, potentially failing due to genetic disorders. Assuming they don't fail.\nOvaries/Testicles produce an abundance of either androgens, or estrogens (with progesterone becoming relevant after puberty mostly)\nThese sex hormones act on hormone receptors, which are primarily governed by somatic chromosomes (ergo: same in XX and XY)\nThese receptors alter gene expression\nThis gene expression causes healthy development of gonads, genitalia and secondary sex characteristics.\nTherefore, if you read it - you find that sexual differentiation is dictated by endocrine levels (barring things like disorders caused by doubling of X chromosome and gonadal function).\n\nTherefore, a woman, using purely biological terms - is a person whose gene expression is primarily dictated by estrogen and progesterone levels. If you care about reproduction, you add the presence of functioning testes or ovaries.

Patients completed outcomes measures preoperatively and 3 months postoperatively. This study took place across 3 institutions in a single, large metropolitan city. Patients aged 13 to 24 years who presented for gender-affirming top surgery were recruited into the treatment arm. Patients in the treatment arm were matched with individuals in the control arm based on age and duration of testosterone therapy.\n\n**Exposures**  Patients in the surgical cohort underwent gender-affirming mastectomy; surgical technique was at the discretion of the surgeon.\n\n**Main Outcomes and Measures**  Patient-reported outcomes were collected at enrollment and 3 months postoperatively or 3 months postbaseline for the control cohort. The primary outcome was the Chest Dysphoria Measure (CDM). Secondary outcomes included the Transgender Congruence Scale (TCS) and Body Image Scale (BIS). Baseline demographic and surgical variables were collected, and descriptive statistics were calculated. Inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) was used to estimate the association of top surgery with outcomes. Probability of treatment was estimated using gradient-boosted machines with the following covariates: baseline outcome score, age, gender identity, race, ethnicity, insurance type, body mass index, testosterone use duration, chest binding, and parental support.\n\n**Results**  Overall, 81 patients were enrolled (mean [SD] age, 18.6 [2.7] years); 11 were lost to follow-up. Thirty-six surgical patients and 34 matched control patients completed the outcomes measures. Weighted absolute standardized mean differences were acceptable between groups with respect to body mass index, but were not comparable with respect to the remaining demographic variables baseline outcome measures. Surgical complications were minimal. IPTW analyses suggest an association between surgery and substantial improvements in CDM (\u201325.58 points; 95% CI, \u201329.18 to \u201321.98), TCS (7.78 points; 95% CI, 6.06-9.50), and BIS (\u20137.20 points; 95% CI, \u201311.68 to \u20132.72) scores.\n\n**Conclusions and Relevance**  Top surgery in TGNB DFAB AYA is associated with low complication rates. Top surgery is associated with improved chest dysphoria, gender congruence, and body image satisfaction in this age group.\n\n\n\n**Reposted \"without sensationalised title\"**", "created_utc": "1664281864.0", "edited": "False", "id": "iq3gzt5", "is_submitter": "True", "link_id": "t3_xpfh8o", "parent_id": "t3_xpfh8o", "score": "32", "subreddit": "science", "subreddit_id": "t5_mouw"}, {"author": "Hoihe", "body": "Gender constant and permanent.\n\n***\n\n\n\n**Gender identity itself is a composite of multiple \"sub-identities\":**\n\n* Intrinsic Gender Identity\n* Gender Role\n* Gender Expression\n\nAccording to Serano, these 3 forms of gender identity exist independently of each other.\n\nHypatia , Volume 24 , Issue 3: Special Issue: Transgender Studies and Feminism: Theory, Politics, and Gendered Realities , Summer 2009 , pp. 200 - 205\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1527-2001.2009.01052_1.x\n\nWithin our daily lives, we can witness this in form of women performing traditionally male labours, while still identifying as woman (Intrinsic Identity and Gender Role clashing).

Assuming they don't fail.\nOvaries/Testicles produce an abundance of either androgens, or estrogens (with progesterone becoming relevant after puberty mostly)\nThese sex hormones act on hormone receptors, which are primarily governed by somatic chromosomes (ergo: same in XX and XY)\nThese receptors alter gene expression\nThis gene expression causes healthy development of gonads, genitalia and secondary sex characteristics.\nTherefore, if you read it - you find that sexual differentiation is dictated by endocrine levels (barring things like disorders caused by doubling of X chromosome and gonadal function).\n\nTherefore, a woman, using purely biological terms - is a person whose gene expression is primarily dictated by estrogen and progesterone levels. If you care about reproduction, you add the presence of functioning testes or ovaries. But people can live full lives without either, and many women need hysterectomy in order to survive due to cancer or genetic disorders.\n\n**Therefore, a transgender woman who is on a strict HRT regiment whose gonads were removed is functionally no different from an androgen-insensitive woman.**", "created_utc": "1664277899.0", "edited": "False", "id": "iq3a728", "is_submitter": "True", "link_id": "t3_xpdf4x", "parent_id": "t1_iq3a4np", "score": "1", "subreddit": "science", "subreddit_id": "t5_mouw"}, {"author": "Hoihe", "body": "race has no biological basis.

Surgical complications were minimal.\n\n**Meaning**  This study suggests that gender-affirming top surgery is associated with improved chest dysphoria, gender congruence, and body image in this age group.\n\n*****\n\n**Importance**  Transgender and nonbinary (TGNB) adolescents and young adults (AYA) designated female at birth (DFAB) experience chest dysphoria, which is associated with depression and anxiety. Top surgery may be performed to treat chest dysphoria.\n\n**Objective**  To determine whether top surgery improves chest dysphoria, gender congruence, and body image in TGNB DFAB AYA.\n\n**Design, Setting, and Participants**  This is a nonrandomized prospective cohort study of patients who underwent top surgery between December 2019 and April 2021 and a matched control group who did not receive surgery. Patients completed outcomes measures preoperatively and 3 months postoperatively. This study took place across 3 institutions in a single, large metropolitan city. Patients aged 13 to 24 years who presented for gender-affirming top surgery were recruited into the treatment arm. Patients in the treatment arm were matched with individuals in the control arm based on age and duration of testosterone therapy.\n\n**Exposures**  Patients in the surgical cohort underwent gender-affirming mastectomy; surgical technique was at the discretion of the surgeon.\n\n**Main Outcomes and Measures**  Patient-reported outcomes were collected at enrollment and 3 months postoperatively or 3 months postbaseline for the control cohort. The primary outcome was the Chest Dysphoria Measure (CDM). Secondary outcomes included the Transgender Congruence Scale (TCS) and Body Image Scale (BIS). Baseline demographic and surgical variables were collected, and descriptive statistics were calculated. Inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) was used to estimate the association of top surgery with outcomes. Probability of treatment was estimated using gradient-boosted machines with the following covariates: baseline outcome score, age, gender identity, race, ethnicity, insurance type, body mass index, testosterone use duration, chest binding, and parental support.\n\n**Results**  Overall, 81 patients were enrolled (mean [SD] age, 18.6 [2.7] years); 11 were lost to follow-up. Thirty-six surgical patients and 34 matched control patients completed the outcomes measures. Weighted absolute standardized mean differences were acceptable between groups with respect to body mass index, but were not comparable with respect to the remaining demographic variables baseline outcome measures. Surgical complications were minimal. IPTW analyses suggest an association between surgery and substantial improvements in CDM (\u201325.58 points; 95% CI, \u201329.18 to \u201321.98), TCS (7.78 points; 95% CI, 6.06-9.50), and BIS (\u20137.20 points; 95% CI, \u201311.68 to \u20132.72) scores.\n\n**Conclusions and Relevance**  Top surgery in TGNB DFAB AYA is associated with low complication rates.

The right of every man and woman, from birth to adulthood, to complete upkeep, clothes, food, shelter, care, guidance, education (public schools, primary, secondary, higher education, artistic, industrial, and scientific), all at the expense of society.\n> 1. The equal right of adolescents, while freely choosing their careers, to be helped and to the greatest possible extent supported by society. After this, society will exercise no authority or supervision over them except to respect, and if necessary defend, their freedom and their rights.\n> 1. The freedom of adults of both sexes must be absolute and complete, freedom to come and go, to voice all opinions, to be lazy or active, moral or immoral, in short, to dispose of one\u2019s person or possessions as one pleases, being accountable to no one. Freedom to live, be it honestly, by one\u2019s own labor, even at the expense of individuals who voluntarily tolerate one\u2019s exploitation.\n> 1. Unlimited freedom of propaganda, speech, press, public or private assembly, with no other restraint than the natural salutary power of public opinion. Absolute freedom to organize associations even for allegedly immoral purposes including even those associations which advocate the undermining (or destruction) of individual and public freedom.\n> 1. Freedom can and must be defended only by freedom: to advocate the restriction of freedom on the pretext that it is being defended is a dangerous delusion. As morality has no other source, no other object, no other stimulant than freedom, all restrictions of liberty in order to protect morality have always been to the detriment of the latter. Psychology, statistics, and all history prove that individual and social immorality are the inevitable consequences of a false private and public education, of the degeneration of public morality and the corruption of public opinion, and above all, of. the vicious organization of society. An eminent Belgian statistician [Qu\u00e9telet] points out that society opens the way for the crimes later committed by malefactors. It follows that all attempts to combat social immorality by rigorous legislation which violates individual freedom must fail. Experience, on the contrary, demonstrates that a repressive and authoritarian system, far from preventing, only increases crime; that public and private morality falls or rises to the extent that individual liberty is restricted or enlarged. It follows that in order to regenerate society, we must first completely uproot this political and social system founded on inequality, privilege, and contempt for humanity. After having reconstructed society on the basis of the most complete liberty, equality, and justice \u2014 not to mention work \u2014 for all and an enlightened education inspired by respect for man \u2014 public opinion will then reflect the new humanity and become a natural guardian of the most absolute liberty [and public order. Ed.].\n> 1. Society cannot, however, leave itself completely defenseless against vicious and parasitic individuals. Work must be the basis of all political rights. The units of society, each within its own jurisdiction, can deprive all such antisocial adults of political rights (except the old, the sick, and those dependent on private or public subsidy) and will be obliged to restore their political rights as soon as they begin to live by their own labor.\n> 1. The liberty of every human being is inalienable and society will never require any individual to surrender his liberty or to sign contracts with other individuals except on the basis of the most complete equality and reciprocity. Society cannot forcibly prevent any man or woman so devoid of personal dignity as to place him- or herself in voluntary servitude to another individual; but it can justly treat such persons as parasites, not entitled to the enjoyment of political liberty, though only for the duration of their servitude.\n> 1. Persons losing their political rights will also lose custody of their children. Persons who violate voluntary agreements, steal, inflict bodily harm, or above all, violate the freedom of any individual, native or foreigner, will be penalized according to the laws of society.\n> 1. Individuals condemned by the laws of any and every association (commune, province, region, or nation) reserve the right to escape punishment by declaring that they wish to resign from that association. But in this case, the association will have the equal right to expel him and declare him outside its guarantee and protection.\n\n\n\nThere are bits that I do not like in how the catechism is worded (the concept of social parasite is easily abused to force social conformity, to rid us of scientists, artists and people with invisible impairments (autistic, ADHD and other states of mind that limit ability to perform labour).\n\nFurthermore, I find the idea that individuals CAN put themselves into bondage through contracts problematic, as even with the Individual Rights listed as so, there can still be coercion.\n\nHowever, overall - the Revolutionary Catechism demonstrates a global implementation of anarchism with strong \"laws\" that protect people like me from abuse.", "created_utc": "1663944286.0", "edited": "False", "id": "iplofvc", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_xkxv01", "parent_id": "t1_iplo4gz", "score": "1", "subreddit": "AutismInWomen", "subreddit_id": "t5_3yx96k"}, {"author": "Hoihe", "body": "There are types of hierarchies. Some are neutral (Supplylines/distribution, mentor-student relationships, expertise), some are negative (those based upon inheritance, identity, ethnicity - circumstances of birth in short)\n\nConsider, \"Revolutionary Catechism\" - Social Anarchism work by Mikhail Bakunin.\n\n**Point K:**\n\n> The basic unit of all political organization in each country must be the completely autonomous commune, constituted by the majority vote of all adults of both sexes. No one shall have either the power or the right to interfere in the internal life of the commune. The commune elects all functionaries, law-makers, and judges. It administers the communal property and finances. Every commune should have the incontestable right to create, without superior sanction, its own constitution and legislation. But in order to join and become an integral part of the provincial federation, the commune must conform its own particular charter to the fundamental principles of the provincial constitution and be accepted by the parliament of the province. The commune must also accept the judgments of the provincial tribunal and any measures ordered by the government of the province. (All measures of the provincial government must be ratified by the provincial parliament.) Communes refusing to accept the provincial laws will not be entitled to its benefits.\n\n**point L:\n**\n> The province must be nothing but a free federation of autonomous communes. The provincial parliament could be composed either of a single chamber with representatives of each of the communes or of two chambers, the other representing the population of the province, independent of the communes. The provincial parliament, without interfering in any manner whatsoever in the internal decisions of the communes will formulate the provincial constitution (based on the principles of this catechism). This constitution must be accepted by all communes wishing to participate in the provincial parliament. The provincial parliament will enact legislation defining the rights and obligations of individuals, communes, and associations in relation to the provincial federation, and the penalties for violations of its laws. It will reserve, however, the right of the communes to diverge on secondary points, though not on fundamentals.\n> \n> The provincial parliament, in strict accordance with the Charter of the Federation of Communes, will define the rights and obligations existing between the communes, the parliament, the judicial tribunal, and the provincial administration. It will enact all laws affecting the whole province, pass on resolutions or measures of the national parliament, without, however, violating the autonomy of the communes and the province. Without interfering in the internal administration of the communes, it will allot to each commune its share of the provincial or national income, which will be used by the commune as its members decide. The provincial parliament will ratify or reject all policies and measures of the provincial administration which will, of course, be elected by universal suffrage. The provincial tribunal (also elected by universal suffrage) will adjudicate, without appeal, all disputes between communes and individuals, communes and communes, and communes and the provincial administration or parliament. [These arrangements will thus] lead not to dull, lifeless uniformity, but to a real living unity, to the enrichment of communal life. A unity will be created which reflects the needs and aspirations of the communes; in short, we will have individual and collective freedom. This unity cannot be achieved by the compulsion or violence of provincial power, for even truth and justice when coercively imposed must lead to falsehood and iniquity.\n\n**Point M thus follows:\n**\n> The nation must be nothing but a federation of autonomous provinces.\n\n**Finally, point N tells us the global structure:\n**\n> Principles of the International Federation. The union of nations comprising the International Federation will be based on the principles outlined above. It is probable, and strongly desired as well, that when the hour of the People\u2019s Revolution strikes again, every nation will unite in brotherly solidarity and forge an unbreakable alliance against the coalition of reactionary nations. This alliance will be the germ of the future Universal Federation of Peoples which will eventually embrace the entire world. The International Federation of revolutionary peoples, with a parliament, a tribunal, and an international executive committee, will naturally be based on the principles of the revolution. Applied to international polity these principles are:\n\n**The principles of international federation which ALL communes MUST follow:**\n\n> 1. Every land, every nation, every people, large or small, weak or strong, every region, province, and commune has the absolute right to self-determination, to make alliances, unite or secede as it pleases, regardless of so-called historic rights and the political, commercial, or strategic ambitions of States. The unity of the elements of society, in order to be genuine, fruitful, and durable, must be absolutely free: it can emerge only from the internal needs and mutual attractions of the respective units of society....\n> 1. Abolition of alleged historic right and the horrible right of conquest.\n> 1. Absolute rejection of the politics of aggrandizement, of the power and the glory of the State. For this is a form of politics which locks each country into a self-made fortress, shutting out the rest of humanity, organizing itself into a closed world, independent of all human solidarity, finding its glory and prosperity in the evil it can do to other countries. A country bent on conquest is necessarily a country internally enslaved.\n> 1. The glory and grandeur of a nation lie only in the development of its humanity. Its strength and inner vitality are measured by the degree of its liberty.\n> 1. The well-being and the freedom of nations as well as individuals are inextricably interwoven. Therefore, there must be free commerce, exchange, and communication among all federated countries, and abolition of frontiers, passports, and customs duties [tariffs]. Every citizen of a federated country must enjoy the same civic rights and it must be easy for him to acquire citizenship and enjoy political rights in all other countries adhering to the same federation. If liberty is the starting point, it will necessarily lead to unity. But to go from unity to liberty is difficult, if not impossible; even if it were possible, it could be done only by destroying a spurious \u201cunity\u201d imposed by force....\n> 1. No federated country shall maintain a permanent standing army or any institution separating the soldier from the civilian. Not only do permanent ,armies and professional soldiers breed internal disruption, brutalization, and financial ruin, they also menace the independence and well-being of other nations. All able-bodied citizens should, if necessary, take up arms to defend their homes and their freedom.

The International Tribunal shall have no other function than to settle, without appeal, all disputes between nations and their respective provinces. Differences between two federated countries shall be adjudicated, without appeal, only by the International Parliament, which, in the name of the entire revolutionary federation, will also formulate common policy and make war, if unavoidable, against the reactionary coalition.\n> 1. No federated nation shall make war against another federated country. If there is war and the International Tribunal has pronounced its decision, the aggressor must submit. If this doesn\u2019t occur, the other federated nations will sever relations with it and, in case of attack by the aggressor, unite to repel invasion.\n> 1. All members of the revolutionary federation must actively take part in approved wars against a nonfederated state. If a federated nation declares unjust war on an outside State against the advice of the International Tribunal, it will be notified in advance that it will have to do so alone.\n> 1. It is hoped that the federated states will eventually give up the expensive luxury of separate diplomatic representatives to foreign states and arrange for representatives to speak in the name of all the federated States.\n> 1.

Your wife can always stop consenting, and divorce you without justification.)\n> * If fulfilment of identity requires restricting another person's ability to fulfil their own in a reasonable manner. Ergo - having a transgender co-worker in a laboratory does not limit your ability to fulfil your christian identity. Not being able to get hired because you're trans or a sikh DOES limit your ability to fulfil your gender/religious identity.

Sexual differentiation of the human brain in relation to gender identity and sexual orientation. Functional Neurology, 24(1), 17\u201328. https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0805542105\n\nIn this cited paper, Swaab et al studied people with a condition known as Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome. Androgen Insensitivty syndrome causes testosterone (and other androgen) hormones to have failure binding to their appropriate receptors, or for those receptors to provide a lesser signal than they should.\n\nThe consequence of AAS can range from underdeveloped testes and penis with gynecomastia to having a vagina with gonads that are neither testicles nor ovaries.\n\nIt has been found by Swaab et al that depending on which specific androgens are blocked, gender identity varies: Total AAS led to a person to become a cisgender intersex woman, whereas partial AAS led to a transgender intersex man.\n\nBy observing this, Swaab et al demonstrate that gender identity is likely controlled by how the brain interacts with hormone levels during foetal and perhaps early childhood development, independent of nurture. This can be caused by less-extreme forms of genetic disorders that affects hormone processing, and it's also possible for such disorders to be \"localized\" - the genes are there, working... but the other genes regulating the expression of the genes regulating testosterone receptor proteins might be locally dysfunctional, causing too much/too little exposure, affecting gender identity.\n\n********\n\n\n**As seen above, gender identity is intrinsic to the individual and cannot be changed. What about sex? Well - let's consider what sexual dimorphism actually is!**\n\n\n********\n\none can read any Graduate level biology textbook regarding human sexual dimorphism. There, they would learn that gonadal differentiation is initiated by the SRY gene on the Y chromosome. This singular gene determines if your gonads develop into ovaries or testicles. The rest of the Y chromosome acts to regulate the function of testicles, and to assist in its healthy development.\n\nThe rest of human sexual differentiation is initiated by the gonads themselves - gonads produce sex hormones: estrogens, androgens and progesterons. These estrogens, androgens and progesterons then bind with their respective receptors (which, barring androgen receptors - which are found on the X chromosome - are found scattered on 6 and 14 and 17 somatic chromosomes. Somatic chromosomes are the same in men and women), altering gene expression.\n\nThis altered gene expression is drawn primarily from somatic chromosomes, and is found in both men and women.\n\nHuman sexual differentiation, therefore - using graduate level biology:\n\nPresence or absence of SRY gene decides if you get testicles or ovaries\nOvaries/Testicles develop, potentially failing due to genetic disorders. Assuming they don't fail.\nOvaries/Testicles produce an abundance of either androgens, or estrogens (with progesterone becoming relevant after puberty mostly)\nThese sex hormones act on hormone receptors, which are primarily governed by somatic chromosomes (ergo: same in XX and XY)\nThese receptors alter gene expression\nThis gene expression causes healthy development of gonads, genitalia and secondary sex characteristics.\nTherefore, if you read it - you find that sexual differentiation is dictated by endocrine levels (barring things like disorders caused by doubling of X chromosome and gonadal function).\n\nTherefore, a woman, using purely biological terms - is a person whose gene expression is primarily dictated by estrogen and progesterone levels. If you care about reproduction, you add the presence of functioning testes or ovaries. But people can live full lives without either, and many women need hysterectomy in order to survive due to cancer or genetic disorders.\n\n**Therefore, a transgender woman who is on a strict HRT regiment whose gonads were removed is functionally no different from an androgen-insensitive woman.**", "created_utc": "1663850388.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ipglsw6", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_xkuqd4", "parent_id": "t3_xkuqd4", "score": "1", "subreddit": "transgender", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qxpm"}, {"author": "Hoihe", "body": "OK, enjoy !\n\nGender constant and permanent.\n\n***\n\n\n\n**Gender identity itself is a composite of multiple \"sub-identities\":**\n\n* Intrinsic Gender Identity\n* Gender Role\n* Gender Expression\n\nAccording to Serano, these 3 forms of gender identity exist independently of each other.\n\nHypatia , Volume 24 , Issue 3: Special Issue: Transgender Studies and Feminism: Theory, Politics, and Gendered Realities , Summer 2009 , pp. 200 - 205\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1527-2001.2009.01052_1.x\n\nWithin our daily lives, we can witness this in form of women performing traditionally male labours, while still identifying as woman (Intrinsic Identity and Gender Role clashing).

Sexual differentiation of the human brain in relation to gender identity and sexual orientation. Functional Neurology, 24(1), 17\u201328. https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0805542105\n\nIn this cited paper, Swaab et al studied people with a condition known as Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome. Androgen Insensitivty syndrome causes testosterone (and other androgen) hormones to have failure binding to their appropriate receptors, or for those receptors to provide a lesser signal than they should.\n\nThe consequence of AAS can range from underdeveloped testes and penis with gynecomastia to having a vagina with gonads that are neither testicles nor ovaries.\n\nIt has been found by Swaab et al that depending on which specific androgens are blocked, gender identity varies: Total AAS led to a person to become a cisgender intersex woman, whereas partial AAS led to a transgender intersex man.\n\nBy observing this, Swaab et al demonstrate that gender identity is likely controlled by how the brain interacts with hormone levels during foetal and perhaps early childhood development, independent of nurture. This can be caused by less-extreme forms of genetic disorders that affects hormone processing, and it's also possible for such disorders to be \"localized\" - the genes are there, working... but the other genes regulating the expression of the genes regulating testosterone receptor proteins might be locally dysfunctional, causing too much/too little exposure, affecting gender identity.\n\n********\n\n\n**As seen above, gender identity is intrinsic to the individual and cannot be changed. What about sex? Well - let's consider what sexual dimorphism actually is!**\n\n\n********\n\none can read any Graduate level biology textbook regarding human sexual dimorphism. There, they would learn that gonadal differentiation is initiated by the SRY gene on the Y chromosome. This singular gene determines if your gonads develop into ovaries or testicles. The rest of the Y chromosome acts to regulate the function of testicles, and to assist in its healthy development.\n\nThe rest of human sexual differentiation is initiated by the gonads themselves - gonads produce sex hormones: estrogens, androgens and progesterons. These estrogens, androgens and progesterons then bind with their respective receptors (which, barring androgen receptors - which are found on the X chromosome - are found scattered on 6 and 14 and 17 somatic chromosomes. Somatic chromosomes are the same in men and women), altering gene expression.\n\nThis altered gene expression is drawn primarily from somatic chromosomes, and is found in both men and women.\n\nHuman sexual differentiation, therefore - using graduate level biology:\n\nPresence or absence of SRY gene decides if you get testicles or ovaries\nOvaries/Testicles develop, potentially failing due to genetic disorders. Assuming they don't fail.\nOvaries/Testicles produce an abundance of either androgens, or estrogens (with progesterone becoming relevant after puberty mostly)\nThese sex hormones act on hormone receptors, which are primarily governed by somatic chromosomes (ergo: same in XX and XY)\nThese receptors alter gene expression\nThis gene expression causes healthy development of gonads, genitalia and secondary sex characteristics.\nTherefore, if you read it - you find that sexual differentiation is dictated by endocrine levels (barring things like disorders caused by doubling of X chromosome and gonadal function).\n\nTherefore, a woman, using purely biological terms - is a person whose gene expression is primarily dictated by estrogen and progesterone levels. If you care about reproduction, you add the presence of functioning testes or ovaries. But people can live full lives without either, and many women need hysterectomy in order to survive due to cancer or genetic disorders.\n\n**Therefore, a transgender woman who is on a strict HRT regiment whose gonads were removed is functionally no different from an androgen-insensitive woman.**", "created_utc": "1663850364.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ipglr7f", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_xkuqd4", "parent_id": "t1_ipg40ma", "score": "1", "subreddit": "transgender", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qxpm"}, {"author": "Hoihe", "body": "And then your country's oligarchs/autocrats/whatever applicable go and hijack this very argument.\n\nThey start flagging all the activist groups, all the people fighting for their rights as Western plants, as agents of western imperialism, as Decadent Westerners.\n\nIt's frustrating as all hells even when you live in a country that only teeters towards this bullshit.

I also have my attention randomly fail while listening by focusing on a single word spoken and failing to hear the rest. \n\nFurthermore, if it's an environment that has a lot of sensory stimulation - lights, noise, just people in general - I at minimum end up feeling exhausted and frustrated trying to hold a conversation, at worst I'll literally stop being able to process spoken word. I hear what you say, but my brain cannot separate your words from the background noise and it all melds into a singular garbled sound (imagine watching movies with bad sound balance and being forced to use subtitles to follow the plot. Well, that's talking to people in physical space for me unless it's sufficiently quiet and focused).\n\nFinally, too much stress (simply from noise, lights, quantity of people) can and has made me lose my voice - like, I open my mouth, try and force dialogue and no sound comes. It's fun!\n\nBeyond these intrinsic difficulties borne of my sensory difficulties and verbal challenges, social ones come to top it off. I live in Eastern Europe where people who are different are highly ostracized. My peculiar body language and vocal modulation has drawn me quite a bit of bullying. Furthermore, I am LGBT - the government is actively rousing the rabble towards violence regarding people like me. Outside of my workplace/university and close friends (who have been fortunate enough to move to Western Europe already), interacting face-to-face with people is too risky for my blood. I've already faced threats of violence for simply existing on the train by my bigoted countrymen.\n\n\nWith all of the above - one wonders how I could fulfil my social need if face-to-face interaction is uncomfortable, strenuous AND dangerous at the same time. Simple! Digital means of communication: Discord, IRC, hobbyist forums and small-time subreddits. My difficulties regarding verbal communication evaporate when I have the opportunity to type - no more body language being misinterpreted by either me or my communication partner, no more weird pitch modulation or slurring words together, no more being unable to hear what someone says due to absence of competent sensory filtration or mismanagement of attention - typing and reading solves all of this! Furthermore, bigots can't stab me if I'm staying home.\n\nAnd so - I will pick being on my phone over talking to strangers or even friends in public spaces. I'll speak to friends in a shared public space over discord. I'll hang out with friends who moved abroad through digital spaces.\n\nTurns out - I'm not introverted. I'm quite social in fact!

Forming a coalition is prohibited after elections are done.\n\nSo, if fidesz has 45% of votes and opposition has 55% together, they cannot form a coalition by law to gain majority. Fidesz wins\n9.

However, being a man does not dictate you cannot wear a skirt.\n\n\n\n**For Intrinsic gender identity itself, I'll depart from social science and onto neuropsychology.**\n\n\n\n*Burke et al (2017)* found was found that after controlling for sexual/romantic orientation, culture, etc... there exist a difference between transgender people (with physical dysphoria, before transitioning medically) and cisgender people when it comes to neural structures.\n\nThese differences manifest primarily in neuro-motor regions, regions corresponding for sensory processing. Basically, places where the brain communicates with the body. \n\nThe differences are that these regions appear \"underdeveloped\", as if not being exercised.\n\nIt's not \"male brain\" or \"female brain\", it's \"my brain doesn't get the responses from my body that it expects\" vs \"my body looks and behaves like my brain expects.\"\n\n*Khorashad et al (2021)* later investigated these findings, finding that these neural differences disappear upon taking gender-confirming cross-sex hormonal therapy. Or at the very least, minimize. \n\nMeaning, it appears that the weakened connections become exercised and reinforced.\n\nThis explains why trans people who have medically transitioned no longer exhibit these patterns, and also tracks with reports of gender dysphoria easing over time even though the person does not culturally/socially pass.\n\n**Two methods of action are proposed:**\n\na) body feels and behaves as the brain's \"internal blueprint\" expects it to: hormone levels are correct, the proper genes are expressed now, the right proteins and shape and function.\n\nJust like doing exercises reinforces neural pathways, so does the body responding like the brain expects it to does the same.\n\nb) Hormones directly bind with hormone receptors in the brain, encouraging the formation of new neural structures.\n\nB would explain what some trans people call \"hormonal/endocrine dysphoria.\" Or rather the euphoria from being on hormones even before physical changes set in.\n\nThe two mechanisms proposed are not exclusive, but yet to be determined.\n\n\nBurke, S.M., Manzouri, A.H. & Savic, I.

Sexual differentiation of the human brain in relation to gender identity and sexual orientation. Functional Neurology, 24(1), 17\u201328. https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0805542105\n\nIn this cited paper, Swaab et al studied people with a condition known as Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome. Androgen Insensitivty syndrome causes testosterone (and other androgen) hormones to have failure binding to their appropriate receptors, or for those receptors to provide a lesser signal than they should.\n\nThe consequence of AAS can range from underdeveloped testes and penis with gynecomastia to having a vagina with gonads that are neither testicles nor ovaries.\n\nIt has been found by Swaab et al that depending on which specific androgens are blocked, gender identity varies: Total AAS led to a person to become a cisgender intersex woman, whereas partial AAS led to a transgender intersex man.\n\nBy observing this, Swaab et al demonstrate that gender identity is likely controlled by how the brain interacts with hormone levels during foetal and perhaps early childhood development, independent of nurture. This can be caused by less-extreme forms of genetic disorders that affects hormone processing, and it's also possible for such disorders to be \"localized\" - the genes are there, working... but the other genes regulating the expression of the genes regulating testosterone receptor proteins might be locally dysfunctional, causing too much/too little exposure, affecting gender identity.\n\n********\n\n\n**As seen above, gender identity is intrinsic to the individual and cannot be changed. What about sex? Well - let's consider what sexual dimorphism actually is!**\n\n\n********\n\none can read any Graduate level biology textbook regarding human sexual dimorphism. There, they would learn that gonadal differentiation is initiated by the SRY gene on the Y chromosome. This singular gene determines if your gonads develop into ovaries or testicles. The rest of the Y chromosome acts to regulate the function of testicles, and to assist in its healthy development.\n\nThe rest of human sexual differentiation is initiated by the gonads themselves - gonads produce sex hormones: estrogens, androgens and progesterons. These estrogens, androgens and progesterons then bind with their respective receptors (which, barring androgen receptors - which are found on the X chromosome - are found scattered on 6 and 14 and 17 somatic chromosomes. Somatic chromosomes are the same in men and women), altering gene expression.\n\nThis altered gene expression is drawn primarily from somatic chromosomes, and is found in both men and women.\n\nHuman sexual differentiation, therefore - using graduate level biology:\n\nPresence or absence of SRY gene decides if you get testicles or ovaries\nOvaries/Testicles develop, potentially failing due to genetic disorders. Assuming they don't fail.\nOvaries/Testicles produce an abundance of either androgens, or estrogens (with progesterone becoming relevant after puberty mostly)\nThese sex hormones act on hormone receptors, which are primarily governed by somatic chromosomes (ergo: same in XX and XY)\nThese receptors alter gene expression\nThis gene expression causes healthy development of gonads, genitalia and secondary sex characteristics.\nTherefore, if you read it - you find that sexual differentiation is dictated by endocrine levels (barring things like disorders caused by doubling of X chromosome and gonadal function).\n\nTherefore, a woman, using purely biological terms - is a person whose gene expression is primarily dictated by estrogen and progesterone levels. If you care about reproduction, you add the presence of functioning testes or ovaries. But people can live full lives without either, and many women need hysterectomy in order to survive due to cancer or genetic disorders.\n\n**Therefore, a transgender woman who is on a strict HRT regiment whose gonads were removed is functionally no different from an androgen-insensitive woman.**", "created_utc": "1663350363.0", "edited": "False", "id": "iooyv1v", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_xf2zgr", "parent_id": "t1_iooyifc", "score": "1", "subreddit": "ShitAmericansSay", "subreddit_id": "t5_2w57u"}, {"author": "Hoihe", "body": "The Prime Minister also said that he had already seen how effective Chinese state capitalism was in 2010, and that he would therefore like to see a similar economic model developed in Hungary, which is the basis of his so-called unorthodox economic policy.", "created_utc": "1663348256.0", "edited": "False", "id": "iooteg4", "is_submitter": "True", "link_id": "t3_xfx1ge", "parent_id": "t3_xfx1ge", "score": "15", "subreddit": "worldnews", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13"}, {"author": "Hoihe", "body": "If you abandon your British citizenship and naturalize with an indian one?

Is it to empower the individual to live a full life free of coercion, or to put them in service for some abstract concept such as \"Family\", \"Church\", \"Nation-state\" or vague ideals.\n\nThere's both capitalist and communist individualism, and likewise capitalist and communist collectivism.\n\nAs a note, often collectivism simply means individualism for the aristocracy/ruling class, collectivism for the masses. This tracks with Minkov et al (2017, https://doi.org/10.1108/CCSM-11-2016-0197).\n\n> Thus, a key element of IDV-COLL differences is general societal freedom versus general societal restriction or restrictiveness for the sake of conformism. In IDV societies, people are allowed \"to do their own thing\" (Triandis, 1993, p. 159) but in COLL ones, individuals' choices - such as selection of a spouse or a professional career - are often made for them by others, usually senior family members or community elders. Individuals often have no other choice than to conform to the societal rule that dictates obedience and avoid engaging in a costly conflict.\n> \n> Obedience and conformism may sound like alarming societal characteristics. Conflict avoidance also seems reprehensible from an IDV perspective if it involves submission and acceptance of a lose-win solution: \"lose\" for the individual, \"win\" for society. But these COLL characteristics do not exist for their own sake. COLL communities would have difficulty surviving without conformism and submission. Libertarians whose views and behaviors are not aligned with those of the mainstream could have a devastating effect on in-group cohesion.\n> \n> COLL societies cannot allow too much individual freedom, conflict, and divergence from tradition lest they lose their cohesiveness and harmony, and fall apart. In an economically poor environment, if individuals were left to their own devices, many would not survive. For the same reason, COLL societies emphasize hierarchy and power distance. The social fabric must be preserved in its tightly-knit original, either voluntarily or by force. Somebody must have unchallengeable authority to quell dissent.\n\n**Localized vs Centralized**\n\nShould power be held by local groups - local councils, local trade unions, small countries/states, counties - or should everything be dictated by a central authority like a federal government, a country-wide union ran by the state, by the capital?\n\nNaturally, this can be a split - personally I think social issues should be centrally enforced, while economic work should be distributed beyond estabilishment of obligations and rights. \n\n**Employment-based ownership vs external ownership**\n\nWho should decide the direction a company takes? Should it be the workers, the founder who works as well... or should it be members of a state-ran union, or capitalist investors?\n\nExample of employment-based ownership would be Co-operatives.\n\nA mixed example would be co-determination.\n\nAn external example would be state-owned companies in Soviet Hungary (owned by Moscow) or any typical publicly traded company with voting shares\n\n**Universal social safety nets vs Charity**\n\nThis is technically a sub-section of Individualism vs Collectivism, where universal social safety nets are individualist (as universal social safety nets liberate the individual from having to appeal to family, church or other 'moralistic' institutions for housing, food and healthcare), while charity systems empower the church and family and other 'moralistic' institutions to only enable those to survive who adhere to their principles and tenets.", "created_utc": "1663322195.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ion9csl", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_xfe5hr", "parent_id": "t1_ion6mio", "score": "4", "subreddit": "CapitalismVSocialism", "subreddit_id": "t5_3cct3"}, {"author": "Hoihe", "body": "So, in your book - a transgender woman is not a woman, but a man.\n\nA lowborn will always be lowborn no matter their wealth?\n\nCountries are nothing more than a bunch of arbitrary bullshit drawn in squiggly lines on the map.

People should be capable of fulfilling their cultural, ethnic, religious, gender, romantic/sexual identities without it negatively affecting their ability to survive.** \n> \n> Caveats:\n> \n> * If fulfilment of identity requires \"traditional gender roles\" for your wife, it can ONLY be done as long as those participating consent (where consent is NOT coerced, ACTIVELY given. Meaning, adult with adult, children cannot be forced into traditional gender roles. Your wife can always stop consenting, and divorce you without justification.)\n> * If fulfilment of identity requires restricting another person's ability to fulfil their own in a reasonable manner. Ergo - having a transgender co-worker in a laboratory does not limit your ability to fulfil your christian identity. Not being able to get hired because you're trans or a sikh DOES limit your ability to fulfil your gender/religious identity. If your religious identity requires the murder of LGBT people, then being barred from murdering them is an acceptable sacrifice of your liberty we can make.\n> \n> **\\2. People should have their basic needs (healthcare, shelter, basic nutrition, privacy) guaranteed regardless of ability to work or socialize or fit in.**\n> \n> **\\3. People MUST have an ADEQUATE access to pursuing intellectual, athletic, cultural and social activities.**\n> \n> * Adequate: Must have free time to do so. For a minimum requirement, we can achieve this through maximizing monthly working hours at 160 hours a month and minimum 25 days paid time off.\n> * Adequate: Must have a way to choose what they want. This can be labour voucher, money, whatever. It should not be decided for them\n> * Adequate: Using whatever representation of value, they should have enough working even a part time job with disabilities to seek personal fulfilment (maybe they won't be able to afford a schooner to pursue historical re-enaction and living history research as a private person, but they can buy books about boats and afford computer simulations, attend a club where they collectively own a schooner for re-enactment).\n\n\nIf anything, anarcho-capitalism is highly collectivistic as it ties survival to social conformity and serving the hirearchy - social conformity being key component of collectivism\n\n> Finally, we need to dwell on the topic of self-reliance and\n> interdependence.

We can witness this in various subcultures (The concept of \"tomboys\" and \"butch lesbians\", a woman who dresses and behaves as a man traditionally should) (Identity and Expression clashing). \n\nThe idea of \"I'm a man, so I don't wear a skirt\" pertains not to gender identity, but gender expression. Potentially, to your gender role as a way to advertise what role in society you fulfil by dressing the part. However, being a man does not dictate you cannot wear a skirt.\n\n\n\n**For Intrinsic gender identity itself, I'll depart from social science and onto neuropsychology.**\n\n\n\n*Burke et al (2017)* found was found that after controlling for sexual/romantic orientation, culture, etc... there exist a difference between transgender people (with physical dysphoria, before transitioning medically) and cisgender people when it comes to neural structures.\n\nThese differences manifest primarily in neuro-motor regions, regions corresponding for sensory processing. Basically, places where the brain communicates with the body. \n\nThe differences are that these regions appear \"underdeveloped\", as if not being exercised.\n\nIt's not \"male brain\" or \"female brain\", it's \"my brain doesn't get the responses from my body that it expects\" vs \"my body looks and behaves like my brain expects.\"\n\n*Khorashad et al (2021)* later investigated these findings, finding that these neural differences disappear upon taking gender-confirming cross-sex hormonal therapy. Or at the very least, minimize. \n\nMeaning, it appears that the weakened connections become exercised and reinforced.\n\nThis explains why trans people who have medically transitioned no longer exhibit these patterns, and also tracks with reports of gender dysphoria easing over time even though the person does not culturally/socially pass.\n\n**Two methods of action are proposed:**\n\na) body feels and behaves as the brain's \"internal blueprint\" expects it to: hormone levels are correct, the proper genes are expressed now, the right proteins and shape and function.\n\nJust like doing exercises reinforces neural pathways, so does the body responding like the brain expects it to does the same.\n\nb) Hormones directly bind with hormone receptors in the brain, encouraging the formation of new neural structures.\n\nB would explain what some trans people call \"hormonal/endocrine dysphoria.\" Or rather the euphoria from being on hormones even before physical changes set in.\n\nThe two mechanisms proposed are not exclusive, but yet to be determined.\n\n\nBurke, S.M., Manzouri, A.H. & Savic, I.

F., & Garcia-Falgueras, A. (2009). Sexual differentiation of the human brain in relation to gender identity and sexual orientation. Functional Neurology, 24(1), 17\u201328. https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0805542105\n\nIn this cited paper, Swaab et al studied people with a condition known as Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome. Androgen Insensitivty syndrome causes testosterone (and other androgen) hormones to have failure binding to their appropriate receptors, or for those receptors to provide a lesser signal than they should.\n\nThe consequence of AAS can range from underdeveloped testes and penis with gynecomastia to having a vagina with gonads that are neither testicles nor ovaries. \n\nIt has been found by Swaab et al that depending on which specific androgens are blocked, gender identity varies: Total AAS led to a person to become a cisgender intersex woman, whereas partial AAS led to a transgender intersex man.\n\nBy observing this, Swaab et al demonstrate that gender identity is likely controlled by how the brain interacts with hormone levels during foetal and perhaps early childhood development, independent of nurture. This can be caused by less-extreme forms of genetic disorders that affects hormone processing, and it's also possible for such disorders to be \"localized\" - the genes are there, working... but the other genes regulating the expression of the genes regulating testosterone receptor proteins might be locally dysfunctional, causing too much/too little exposure, affecting gender identity.\n\n\nBEYOND ALL THAT, \n\none can read any Graduate level biology textbook regarding human sexual dimorphism. There, they would learn that gonadal differentiation is initiated by the SRY gene on the Y chromosome. This singular gene determines if your gonads develop into ovaries or testicles. The rest of the Y chromosome acts to regulate the function of testicles, and to assist in its healthy development.\n\nThe rest of human sexual differentiation is initiated by the gonads themselves - gonads produce sex hormones: estrogens, androgens and progesterons. These estrogens, androgens and progesterons then bind with their respective receptors (which, barring androgen receptors - which are found on the X chromosome - are found scattered on 6 and 14 and 17 somatic chromosomes. Somatic chromosomes are the same in men and women), altering gene expression.\n\nThis altered gene expression is drawn primarily from somatic chromosomes, and is found in both men and women. \n\nHuman sexual differentiation, therefore - using graduate level biology:\n\n- Presence or absence of SRY gene decides if you get testicles or ovaries\n- Ovaries/Testicles develop, potentially failing due to genetic disorders. Assuming they don't fail.\n- Ovaries/Testicles produce an abundance of either androgens, or estrogens (with progesterone becoming relevant after puberty mostly)\n- These sex hormones act on hormone receptors, which are primarily governed by somatic chromosomes (ergo: same in XX and XY)\n- These receptors alter gene expression\n- This gene expression causes healthy development of gonads, genitalia and secondary sex characteristics.\n\n\nTherefore, if you read it - you find that sexual differentiation is dictated by endocrine levels (barring things like disorders caused by doubling of X chromosome and gonadal function). \n\nTherefore, a woman, using purely biological terms - is a person whose gene expression is primarily dictated by estrogen and progesterone levels. If you care about reproduction, you add the presence of functioning testes or ovaries. But people can live full lives without either, and many women need hysterectomy in order to survive due to cancer or genetic disorders.\n\nTherefore, a transgender woman who is on a strict HRT regiment whose gonads were removed is functionally no different from an androgen-insensitive woman.", "created_utc": "1662551846.0", "edited": "False", "id": "inftxly", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_x7xmm2", "parent_id": "t1_infoxac", "score": "3", "subreddit": "worldnews", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13"}, {"author": "Hoihe", "body": "Also because old software is very hard to update.", "created_utc": "1662547961.0", "edited": "False", "id": "infney9", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_x7xrad", "parent_id": "t1_infff4s", "score": "1", "subreddit": "AskPhysics", "subreddit_id": "t5_2sumo"}, {"author": "Hoihe", "body": "If you plan to use something like Gaussian, yes.\n\nGaussian is a software used for studying electronic structure theory.", "created_utc": "1662547930.0", "edited": "False", "id": "infnd9h", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_x7xrad", "parent_id": "t3_x7xrad", "score": "0", "subreddit": "AskPhysics", "subreddit_id": "t5_2sumo"}, {"author": "Hoihe", "body": "You know that tax funded healthcare and wducation exist?", "created_utc": "1662540936.0", "edited": "False", "id": "infea9f", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_x7xmm2", "parent_id": "t1_infdipw", "score": "1", "subreddit": "worldnews", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13"}, {"author": "Hoihe", "body": "Did you read what i wrote?", "created_utc": "1662540132.0", "edited": "False", "id": "infdcn5", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_x7xmm2", "parent_id": "t1_infd78f", "score": "6", "subreddit": "worldnews", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13"}, {"author": "Hoihe", "body": "My vountry has chinese influence.

We can witness this in various subcultures (The concept of \"tomboys\" and \"butch lesbians\", a woman who dresses and behaves as a man traditionally should) (Identity and Expression clashing). \n\nThe idea of \"I'm a man, so I don't wear a skirt\" pertains not to gender identity, but gender expression. Potentially, to your gender role as a way to advertise what role in society you fulfil by dressing the part. However, being a man does not dictate you cannot wear a skirt.\n\n\n\n**For Intrinsic gender identity itself, I'll depart from social science and onto neuropsychology.**\n\n\n\n*Burke et al (2017)* found was found that after controlling for sexual/romantic orientation, culture, etc... there exist a difference between transgender people (with physical dysphoria, before transitioning medically) and cisgender people when it comes to neural structures.\n\nThese differences manifest primarily in neuro-motor regions, regions corresponding for sensory processing. Basically, places where the brain communicates with the body. \n\nThe differences are that these regions appear \"underdeveloped\", as if not being exercised.\n\nIt's not \"male brain\" or \"female brain\", it's \"my brain doesn't get the responses from my body that it expects\" vs \"my body looks and behaves like my brain expects.\"\n\n*Khorashad et al (2021)* later investigated these findings, finding that these neural differences disappear upon taking gender-confirming cross-sex hormonal therapy. Or at the very least, minimize. \n\nMeaning, it appears that the weakened connections become exercised and reinforced.\n\nThis explains why trans people who have medically transitioned no longer exhibit these patterns, and also tracks with reports of gender dysphoria easing over time even though the person does not culturally/socially pass.\n\n**Two methods of action are proposed:**\n\na) body feels and behaves as the brain's \"internal blueprint\" expects it to: hormone levels are correct, the proper genes are expressed now, the right proteins and shape and function.\n\nJust like doing exercises reinforces neural pathways, so does the body responding like the brain expects it to does the same.\n\nb) Hormones directly bind with hormone receptors in the brain, encouraging the formation of new neural structures.\n\nB would explain what some trans people call \"hormonal/endocrine dysphoria.\" Or rather the euphoria from being on hormones even before physical changes set in.\n\nThe two mechanisms proposed are not exclusive, but yet to be determined.\n\n\nBurke, S.M., Manzouri, A.H. & Savic, I.

To ensure your new life develops similar to old one, you experience frequent dreams where you relive moments from your previous lives - giving you a very, very strong sense of who you are. As you grow older, you add to memories in your current life - which you can actually remember in your waking moment too. Upon dying and returning to Arvandor, you regain all your previous lives' memories, and your identity forms an amalgate of your previous ones.\n\nIn this world, when you love someone you know they may die.

It just means that if you do not particularly feel attached to the social gender that is \"Woman\" in western (post)-Christian society, it does not mean you are not allowed to call yourself a woman.\n\n\n\nTo be transgender, one of the following must be true:\nYour Social Gender Identity differs from what society assigns to your sexual phenotype & sexual orientation   \n**INCLUSIVE OR**  \nYour Internal Gender Identity differs at least in one component (not necessarily ALL components - you are totally valid if you only feel dysphoric due to hormonal stuff and don't want beard or whatever) from the sexual phenotype your body expressed through puberty.\n\n\n\nPersonally, I have a fairly strong overlap of my internal gender identity's expectations with that of the typical human female sexual phenotype, and as such I am pursuing medical transition to achieve that. As a consequence, I identify as a woman.\n\nHowever, I also lack a particularly strong attachment towards any particular social gender identity, bar a few specifics (name, address, culturally influenced idea of how a woman must look like [Long hair, smooth skin under the neck]). I still identify as a woman though, as I place more weight (Personally) on my internal gender identity && I am a feminist, so I reject many of the things my country assigns to women in terms of duties and behaviour and whatnot.\n\n\n\n\n\nHope it helps!", "created_utc": "1662286645.0", "edited": "False", "id": "in1dfa5", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_x52lu6", "parent_id": "t1_in0kne6", "score": "1", "subreddit": "science", "subreddit_id": "t5_mouw"}, {"author": "Hoihe", "body": "**Gender identity itself is a composite of multiple \"sub-identities\":**\n\n* Intrinsic Gender Identity\n* Gender Role\n* Gender Expression\n\nAccording to Serano, these 3 forms of gender identity exist independently of each other.\n\nHypatia , Volume 24 , Issue 3: Special Issue: Transgender Studies and Feminism: Theory, Politics, and Gendered Realities , Summer 2009 , pp. 200 - 205\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1527-2001.2009.01052_1.x\n\nWithin our daily lives, we can witness this in form of women performing traditionally male labours, while still identifying as woman (Intrinsic Identity and Gender Role clashing).

After this, society will exercise no authority or supervision over them except to respect, and if necessary defend, their freedom and their rights.\n> \n> The freedom of adults of both sexes must be absolute and complete, freedom to come and go, to voice all opinions, to be lazy or active, moral or immoral, in short, to dispose of one\u2019s person or possessions as one pleases, being accountable to no one. Freedom to live, be it honestly, by one\u2019s own labor, even at the expense of individuals who voluntarily tolerate one\u2019s exploitation.\n> \n> Unlimited freedom of propaganda, speech, press, public or private assembly, with no other restraint than the natural salutary power of public opinion. Absolute freedom to organize associations even for allegedly immoral purposes including even those associations which advocate the undermining (or destruction) of individual and public freedom.\n> \n> Freedom can and must be defended only by freedom: to advocate the restriction of freedom on the pretext that it is being defended is a dangerous delusion. As morality has no other source, no other object, no other stimulant than freedom, all restrictions of liberty in order to protect morality have always been to the detriment of the latter. Psychology, statistics, and all history prove that individual and social immorality are the inevitable consequences of a false private and public education, of the degeneration of public morality and the corruption of public opinion, and above all, of. the vicious organization of society. An eminent Belgian statistician [Qu\u00e9telet] points out that society opens the way for the crimes later committed by malefactors. It follows that all attempts to combat social immorality by rigorous legislation which violates individual freedom must fail. Experience, on the contrary, demonstrates that a repressive and authoritarian system, far from preventing, only increases crime; that public and private morality falls or rises to the extent that individual liberty is restricted or enlarged. It follows that in order to regenerate society, we must first completely uproot this political and social system founded on inequality, privilege, and contempt for humanity. After having reconstructed society on the basis of the most complete liberty, equality, and justice \u2014 not to mention work \u2014 for all and an enlightened education inspired by respect for man \u2014 public opinion will then reflect the new humanity and become a natural guardian of the most absolute liberty [and public order. Ed.].\n\nOn equality:\n\n> Social Organization. Without political equality there can be no real political liberty, but political equality will be possible only when there is social and economic equality.\n> \n> Equality does not imply the leveling of individual differences, nor that individuals should be made physically, morally, or mentally identical. Diversity in capacities and powers \u2014 those differences between races, nations, sexes, ages, and persons \u2014 far from being a social evil, constitutes, on the contrary, the abundance of humanity. Economic and social equality means the equalization of personal wealth, but not by restricting what a man may acquire by his own skill, productive energy, and thrift.\n> \n> Equality and justice demand only a society so organized that every single human being will \u2014 from birth through adolescence and maturity \u2014 find therein equal means, first for maintenance and education, and later, for the exercise of all his natural capacities and aptitudes. This equality from birth that justice demands for everyone will be impossible as long as the right of inheritance continues to exist.\n> \n> ...\n> \n> Abolition of the right of inheritance. Social inequality \u2014 inequality of classes, privileges, and wealth \u2014 not by right but in fact. will continue to exist until such time as the right of inheritance is abolished. It is an inherent social law that de facto inequality inexorably produces inequality of rights; social inequality leads to political inequality. And without political equality \u2014 in the true, universal, and libertarian sense in which we understand it \u2014 society will always remain divided into two unequal parts. The first. which comprises the great majority of mankind, the masses of the people, will be oppressed by the privileged, exploiting minority. The right of inheritance violates the principle of freedom and must be abolished.\n> \n> ...\n> \n> ...\n> \n> When inequality resulting from the right of inheritance is abolished, there will still remain inequalities [of wealth] \u2014 due to the diverse amounts of energy and skill possessed by individuals. These inequalities will never entirely disappear, but will become more and more minimized under the influence of education and of an egalitarian social organization, and, above all, when the right of inheritance no longer burdens the coming generations.\n> \n> Labor being the sole source of wealth, everyone is free to die of hunger, or to live in the deserts or the forests among savage beasts, but whoever wants to live in society must earn his living by his own labor, or be treated as a parasite who is living on the labor of others.\n> \n> Labor is the foundation of human dignity and morality. For it was only by free and intelligent labor that man, overcoming his own bestiality, attained his humanity and sense of justice, changed his environment, and created the civilized world. The stigma which, in the ancient as well as the feudal world, was attached to labor, and which to a great extent still exists today, despite all the hypocritical phrases about the \u201cdignity of labor\u201d \u2014 this stupid prejudice against labor has two sources: the first is the conviction, so characteristic of the ancient world, that in order to give one part of society the opportunity and the means to humanize itself through science, the arts, philosophy. and the enjoyment of human rights, another part of society, naturally the most numerous, must be condemned to work as slaves.

It is a complex term which we can split into 2 simpler constituents that also have the word, \"gender\" within them complicating things.\n\nLet's start with **constituent A - Social Gender Identity.** Social Gender is what feminism refers to when its proponents say, \"Gender is a social construct!\" (which i agree with). \n\nSocial gender is something arbitrary that society decided to impose upon its members based on their genitalia, sexual phenotype and/or sexual orientation.\n\nWithin social gender we can find the concepts of dress codes, acceptable emotional expressions, behaviour policing, jobs you are (not) allowed to do, your rights and duties and so forth. (Almost) All of this is arbtirary, and if you go to another culture - may change completely. Sometimes you don't even need to go far, just move from a rural village to the capital to experience a drastic change in what it means to be a woman (in my village, people consider being a scientist a male job and look at women weird for going to univ rather than having children, whereas my university in Hungary's capital is full of scholarships encouraging women to get into science).\n\nNow, Autistic people are often described in pop science articles as \"lacking\" an innate understanding of social constructs, which i can sorta identify with! Thus, if we accept this as true - then it makes sense that for those of us whose brains are wired differently, the whole arbitrary idea of social gender with all its unjustified and random rules feel wrong, alien and \"hard to understand.\"\n\nNow, this could mean autistic people have a large number of non-binary/agender individuals. Or it could just make the community gender non-conforming. The only good thing about social gender - because of how utterly random and arbitrary it is - self ID is not only valid: it's encouraged! As such, I self ID as \"Gender non-conforming woman (by standards of rural Hungary)\" It's something of a tongue-in-cheek self ID for me, as I am tired of people telling me I can't be a woman if I like sword fighting and science and maths.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut there's another component to gender I havn't mentioned yet, and something as a neuroscientist may find interesting! \nThe 2 most up to date papers I base this upon:  \nhttps://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-17352-8  (2017)  \nhttps://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-80687-2  (2021)  \n\nThere's more than these two, but these two in particular approached the question by controlling for sexual orientation and ignored social biases like maths skills or language skills. Or rather: They controlled for them. \n\nControlling for all that, these papers found that the brains of transgender individuals differed from those of cisgender individuals. *For sake of not being an unwilling advocate for transmedicalists: This paper focuses on those transgender individuals with \"Physical dysphoria\", and those trans people who are entirely based on the social gender are completely valid.* With that out of the way: \n\nThe 2017 paper found that transgender people show differences in brain regions corresponding to how the individual perceives their own body, regions that create a sense of \"Ownership\" over one's own body. The 2021 paper found that if a transgender person starts to medically transition using hormone replacement therapy, these differences reduce. Taking karyotpe-approrpiate (so estrogen for FTM, testosterone for MTF) did NOT provide improvements, in fact cisgender people taking hormones experienced neural degradation. \n\nThe 2021 paper proposed 2 mechanisms (but it was out of scope to decide which is the real one, but they admitted it could be both) as such:  \n**Mechanism 1:**    \nCross-sex hormones directly interact with neural structures, strengthening the weakened connections.  \n**Mechanism 2:**    \nBy having the body look more like, AND function more like the brain expects it to - these weakened structures strengthen in kind of a feedback loop mumbo jumbo.\n\n\nAs such, we arrive to **Constituent B - Internal Gender Identity/Neural Gender**. Neural Gender is thus defined: A particular sexual phenotype (either binary male or female, or in between) that the brain expects the body to possess after puberty finishes. This includes gonads, endocrine levels and primary & secondary sex characteristics. Any deviation from what the brain expects creates either a direct sense of distress, or a dull pain that is only recognized once eased (in other words: dysphoria). \n\nChances are, if you do not feel any acute sense of distress in regards to your sexual characteristics, and the idea of altering them (including your hormonal make up) does not make you feel you would experience an improvement of mental health, then your neural gender is aligned with your sexual phenotype. \n\nThis does NOT mean you cannot be trans. It just means that if you do not particularly feel attached to the social gender that is \"Woman\" in western (post)-Christian society, it does not mean you are not allowed to call yourself a woman.\n\n\n\nTo be transgender, one of the following must be true:\nYour Social Gender Identity differs from what society assigns to your sexual phenotype & sexual orientation   \n**INCLUSIVE OR**  \nYour Internal Gender Identity differs at least in one component (not necessarily ALL components - you are totally valid if you only feel dysphoric due to hormonal stuff and don't want beard or whatever) from the sexual phenotype your body expressed through puberty.\n\n\n\nPersonally, I have a fairly strong overlap of my internal gender identity's expectations with that of the typical human female sexual phenotype, and as such I am pursuing medical transition to achieve that. As a consequence, I identify as a woman.\n\nHowever, I also lack a particularly strong attachment towards any particular social gender identity, bar a few specifics (name, address, culturally influenced idea of how a woman must look like [Long hair, smooth skin under the neck]). I still identify as a woman though, as I place more weight (Personally) on my internal gender identity && I am a feminist, so I reject many of the things my country assigns to women in terms of duties and behaviour and whatnot.\n\n\n\n\n\nHope it helps!", "created_utc": "1662044021.0", "edited": "False", "id": "imo0haz", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_x2rdp2", "parent_id": "t3_x2rdp2", "score": "2", "subreddit": "asktransgender", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r4b9"}, {"author": "Hoihe", "body": "In the socialism I advocate for:\n\nThere is a comapny.\n\nIt has 100 seats on its executive and supervisory boards together.\n\nUnder capitalism, all 100 seats are assigned according to how many company shares you won.

This cost assumes that you can go to the\n> spellcaster and have the spell cast at his or her convenience\n> (generally at least 24 hours later, so that the spellcaster has time to\n> prepare the spell in question). If you want to bring the spellcaster\n> somewhere to cast a spell, such as into a dungeon to cast knock on a\n> secret door that you can\u2019t open, you need to negotiate with him or\n> her, and the default answer is no.\n> \n> The cost given is for a spell with no cost for a material component\n> or focus component and no XP cost. If the spell includes a material\n> component, add the cost of that component to the cost of the spell.\n> If the spell has a focus component (other than a divine focus), add\n> 1/10 the cost of that focus to the cost of the spell. If the spell has an\n> XP cost, add 5 gp per XP lost.\n> \n>  For instance, to get a 9th-level cleric to\n> cast commune for you, you need to pay 450 gp for a 5th-level spell at\n> caster level 9th, plus 500 gp for the 100 XP loss that the caster suffers, plus 25 gp for the holy water, for a total of 975 gp.\n> Furthermore, if a spell has dangerous consequences (such as\n> contact other plane), the spellcaster will certainly require proof that\n> you can and will pay for dealing with any such consequences (that\n> is, assuming that the spellcaster even agrees to cast such a spell,\n> which isn\u2019t certain).\n> \n>  In the case of spells that transport the caster and\n> characters over a distance (such as teleport), you will likely have to\n> pay for two castings of the spell, even if you aren\u2019t returning with\n> the caster.\n> \n> \n> In addition, not every town or village has a spellcaster of sufficient level to cast any spell. In general, you must travel to **a small\n> town (or larger settlement) to be reasonably assured of finding a\n> spellcaster capable of casting 1st-level spells, a large town for 2nd level spells, a small city for 3rd- or 4th-level spells, a large city for\n> 5th- or 6th-level spells, and a metropolis for 7th- or 8th-level spells.\n> Even a metropolis isn\u2019t guaranteed to have a local spellcaster able to\n> cast 9th-level spells, so seeking out such a caster may become an\n> adventure itself. (The Dungeon Master\u2019s Guide has more information\n> on settlement sizes and demographics.)**\n> \n> \n> Because you must get an actual spellcaster to cast a spell for you\n> and can\u2019t rely on a neutral broker, money is not always sufficient to\n> get a spell cast.

Equality does not imply the leveling of individual differences, nor that individuals should be made physically, morally, or mentally identical. Diversity in capacities and powers \u2014 those differences between races, nations, sexes, ages, and persons \u2014 far from being a social evil, constitutes, on the contrary, the abundance of humanity. Economic and social equality means the equalization of personal wealth, but not by restricting what a man may acquire by his own skill, productive energy, and thrift.\n\n1. Equality and justice demand only a society so organized that every single human being will \u2014 from birth through adolescence and maturity \u2014 find therein equal means, first for maintenance and education, and later, for the exercise of all his natural capacities and aptitudes. This equality from birth that justice demands for everyone will be impossible as long as the right of inheritance continues to exist.\n\n1. Abolition of the right of inheritance. Social inequality \u2014 inequality of classes, privileges, and wealth \u2014 not by right but in fact. will continue to exist until such time as the right of inheritance is abolished. It is an inherent social law that de facto inequality inexorably produces inequality of rights; social inequality leads to political inequality. And without political equality \u2014 in the true, universal, and libertarian sense in which we understand it \u2014 society will always remain divided into two unequal parts. The first. which comprises the great majority of mankind, the masses of the people, will be oppressed by the privileged, exploiting minority. The right of inheritance violates the principle of freedom and must be abolished.\n\n1. When inequality resulting from the right of inheritance is abolished, there will still remain inequalities [of wealth] \u2014 due to the diverse amounts of energy and skill possessed by individuals. These inequalities will never entirely disappear, but will become more and more minimized under the influence of education and of an egalitarian social organization, and, above all, when the right of inheritance no longer burdens the coming generations.\n\n\n1. Labor is the foundation of human dignity and morality. For it was only by free and intelligent labor that man, overcoming his own bestiality, attained his humanity and sense of justice, changed his environment, and created the civilized world. The stigma which, in the ancient as well as the feudal world, was attached to labor, and which to a great extent still exists today, despite all the hypocritical phrases about the \u201cdignity of labor\u201d \u2014 this stupid prejudice against labor has two sources: the first is the conviction, so characteristic of the ancient world, that in order to give one part of society the opportunity and the means to humanize itself through science, the arts, philosophy. and the enjoyment of human rights, another part of society, naturally the most numerous, must be condemned to work as slaves. This fundamental institution of ancient civilization was the cause of its downfall.", "created_utc": "1661256510.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ilg1zdm", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_ws2n3l", "parent_id": "t1_ilg1rke", "score": "1", "subreddit": "CapitalismVSocialism", "subreddit_id": "t5_3cct3"}, {"author": "Hoihe", "body": "You did not choose to be born.\n\nNobody chose to be born.\n\nBehold, the Anarchist's Catechism:\n\nCharter of Individual Rights:\n\n1.

The equal right of adolescents, while freely choosing their careers, to be helped and to the greatest possible extent supported by society. After this, society will exercise no authority or supervision over them except to respect, and if necessary defend, their freedom and their rights.\n\n1. The freedom of adults of both sexes must be absolute and complete, freedom to come and go, to voice all opinions, to be lazy or active, moral or immoral, in short, to dispose of one\u2019s person or possessions as one pleases, being accountable to no one. Freedom to live, be it honestly, by one\u2019s own labor, even at the expense of individuals who voluntarily tolerate one\u2019s exploitation.\n\n1. Unlimited freedom of propaganda, speech, press, public or private assembly, with no other restraint than the natural salutary power of public opinion. Absolute freedom to organize associations even for allegedly immoral purposes including even those associations which advocate the undermining (or destruction) of individual and public freedom.\n\n1. Freedom can and must be defended only by freedom: to advocate the restriction of freedom on the pretext that it is being defended is a dangerous delusion. As morality has no other source, no other object, no other stimulant than freedom, all restrictions of liberty in order to protect morality have always been to the detriment of the latter. Psychology, statistics, and all history prove that individual and social immorality are the inevitable consequences of a false private and public education, of the degeneration of public morality and the corruption of public opinion, and above all, of. the vicious organization of society. An eminent Belgian statistician [Qu\u00e9telet] points out that society opens the way for the crimes later committed by malefactors. It follows that all attempts to combat social immorality by rigorous legislation which violates individual freedom must fail. Experience, on the contrary, demonstrates that a repressive and authoritarian system, far from preventing, only increases crime; that public and private morality falls or rises to the extent that individual liberty is restricted or enlarged. It follows that in order to regenerate society, we must first completely uproot this political and social system founded on inequality, privilege, and contempt for humanity. After having reconstructed society on the basis of the most complete liberty, equality, and justice \u2014 not to mention work \u2014 for all and an enlightened education inspired by respect for man \u2014 public opinion will then reflect the new humanity and become a natural guardian of the most absolute liberty [and public order. Ed.].\n\n1. Society cannot, however, leave itself completely defenseless against vicious and parasitic individuals. Work must be the basis of all political rights. The units of society, each within its own jurisdiction, can deprive all such antisocial adults of political rights (except the old, the sick, and those dependent on private or public subsidy) and will be obliged to restore their political rights as soon as they begin to live by their own labor.\n\n1. The liberty of every human being is inalienable and society will never require any individual to surrender his liberty or to sign contracts with other individuals except on the basis of the most complete equality and reciprocity. Society cannot forcibly prevent any man or woman so devoid of personal dignity as to place him- or herself in voluntary servitude to another individual; but it can justly treat such persons as parasites, not entitled to the enjoyment of political liberty, though only for the duration of their servitude.\n1. Persons losing their political rights will also lose custody of their children. Persons who violate voluntary agreements, steal, inflict bodily harm, or above all, violate the freedom of any individual, native or foreigner, will be penalized according to the laws of society.\n\n1. Individuals condemned by the laws of any and every association (commune, province, region, or nation) reserve the right to escape punishment by declaring that they wish to resign from that association. But in this case, the association will have the equal right to expel him and declare him outside its guarantee and protection.\n\n\nFamily support:\n\n1. Abolition not of the natural family but of the legal family founded on law and property. Religious and civil marriage to be replaced by free marriage. Adult men and women have the right to unite and separate as they please, nor has society the right to hinder their union or to force them to maintain it. With the abolition of the right of inheritance and the education of children assured by society, all the legal reasons for the irrevocability of marriage will disappear. The union of a man and a woman must be free, for a free choice is the indispensable condition for moral sincerity. In marriage, man and woman must enjoy absolute liberty. Neither violence nor passion nor rights surrendered in the past can justify an invasion by one of the liberty of another, and every such invasion shall be considered a crime.\n1. From the moment of pregnancy to birth, a woman and her children shall be subsidized by the communal organization. Women who wish to nurse and wean their children shall also be subsidized.\n\n1. Parents shall have the right to care for and guide the education of their children, under the ultimate control of the commune which retains the right and the obligation to take children away from parents who, by example or by cruel and inhuman treatment, demoralize or otherwise hinder the physical and mental development of their children.\n\n1. Children belong neither to their parents nor to society. They belong to themselves and to their own future liberty. Until old enough to take care of themselves, children must be brought up under the guidance of their elders. It is true that parents are their natural tutors, but since the very future of the commune itself depends upon the intellectual and moral training it gives to children, the commune must be the tutor. The freedom of adults is possible only when the free society looks after the education of minors.\n\n1. The secular school must replace the Church, with the difference that while religious indoctrination perpetuates superstition and divine authority, the sole purpose of secular public education is the gradual, progressive initiation of children into liberty by the triple development of their physical strength, their minds, and their will. Reason, truth, justice, respect for fellowmen, the sense of personal dignity which is inseparable from the dignity of others, love of personal freedom and the freedom of all others, the conviction that work is the base and condition for rights \u2014 these must be the fundamental principles of all public education. Above all, education must make men and inculcate human values first, and then train specialized workers. As the child grows older, authority will give way to more and more liberty, so that by adolescence he will be completely free and will forget how in childhood he had to submit unavoidably to authority. Respect for human worth, the germ of freedom, must be present even while children are being severely disciplined. The essence of all moral education is this: inculcate children with respect for humanity and you will make good men....\n\n1. Having reached the age of adulthood, the adolescent will be proclaimed autonomous and free to act as he deems best. In exchange, society will expect him to fulfill only these three obligations: that he remain free, that he live by his own labor, and that he respect the freedom of others. And, as the crimes and vices infecting present society are due to the evil organization of society, it is certain that in a society based on reason, justice, and freedom, on respect for humanity and on complete equality, the good will prevail and the evil will be a morbid exception, which will diminish more and more under the pervasive influence of an enlightened and humanized public opinion.\n\n1. The old, sick, and infirm will enjoy all political and social rights and be bountifully supported at the expense of society.\n\n\nEquality as a form of Individualism:\n\n1. The freedom of each is therefore realizable only in the equality of all. The realization of freedom through equality, in principle and in fact, is justice.\n\n1. If there is one fundamental principle of human morality, it is freedom. To respect the freedom of your fellowman is duty; to love, help, and serve him is virtue.\n\nSocial organization: (continued in child)", "created_utc": "1661256394.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ilg1rke", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_ws2n3l", "parent_id": "t1_ilg0a3z", "score": "1", "subreddit": "CapitalismVSocialism", "subreddit_id": "t5_3cct3"}, {"author": "Hoihe", "body": "Tgstorytime\n\n\nHas fetish and cute stories alike.\n\nI normally like shadow dragon's.\n\nMost of them are found family stories about eggs", "created_utc": "1661237686.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ilfcnhh", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_wur8lq", "parent_id": "t1_ileimwb", "score": "2", "subreddit": "traaaaaaannnnnnnnnns", "subreddit_id": "t5_2uog0"}, {"author": "Hoihe", "body": "If you have to choose between employment and transitioning.\n\nHonelessness and transitioning...\n\nDo you have freedom?", "created_utc": "1661237647.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ilfclq5", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_ws2n3l", "parent_id": "t1_ilenaza", "score": "1", "subreddit": "CapitalismVSocialism", "subreddit_id": "t5_3cct3"}, {"author": "Hoihe", "body": "Gift of the sea by maybe mergirl fits.", "created_utc": "1661201124.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ildbsym", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_wur8lq", "parent_id": "t1_ilc9xs5", "score": "8", "subreddit": "traaaaaaannnnnnnnnns", "subreddit_id": "t5_2uog0"}, {"author": "Hoihe", "body": "At 0:24 and after\nAt 0:50 and after", "created_utc": "1661198866.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ild66ip", "is_submitter": "True", "link_id": "t3_wv2xz0", "parent_id": "t1_ild4qhj", "score": "1", "subreddit": "NoStupidQuestions", "subreddit_id": "t5_2w844"}, {"author": "Hoihe", "body": "The one that goes \"Tiririririrrirri.\"", "created_utc": "1661198184.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ild4hq7", "is_submitter": "True", "link_id": "t3_wv2xz0", "parent_id": "t1_ild47f4", "score": "2", "subreddit": "NoStupidQuestions", "subreddit_id": "t5_2w844"}, {"author": "Hoihe", "body": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSFgwVwOGDY\n\nRipped it from the game.", "created_utc": "1661197843.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ild3mhq", "is_submitter": "True", "link_id": "t3_wv2xz0", "parent_id": "t1_ild1qly", "score": "1", "subreddit": "NoStupidQuestions", "subreddit_id": "t5_2w844"}, {"author": "Hoihe", "body": "Here it is! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSFgwVwOGDY", "created_utc": "1661197833.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ild3lje", "is_submitter": "True", "link_id": "t3_wv2xz0", "parent_id": "t1_ild2752", "score": "1", "subreddit": "NoStupidQuestions", "subreddit_id": "t5_2w844"}, {"author": "Hoihe", "body": "It's absurd news.", "created_utc": "1661196726.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ild0snw", "is_submitter": "True", "link_id": "t3_wuzrte", "parent_id": "t1_ild01kn", "score": "4", "subreddit": "offbeat", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh11"}, {"author": "Hoihe", "body": "What is propaganda?\n\nIt reports that the Hungarian government is actively buying out media companies, including cell carriers.\n\nThis is concerning news for independent media.", "created_utc": "1661193302.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ilcs47n", "is_submitter": "True", "link_id": "t3_wuzmkj", "parent_id": "t1_ilcqs63", "score": "8", "subreddit": "worldnews", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13"}, {"author": "Hoihe", "body": "Yes.\n\nKatalin Nov\u00e1k is the president of Hungary.

(2017), \"A revision of Hofstede\u2019s individualism-collectivism dimension: A new national index from a 56-country study\", Cross Cultural & Strategic Management, Vol. 24 No. 3, pp. 386-404. https://doi.org/10.1108/CCSM-11-2016-0197\n\n\nTell me, who do you recognize in the above quote? That side is the collectivist\n\nLibertarian in this case includes people who advocate for reproductive rights, LGBT rights, minority rights.\n\n> For individualism to exist, the following must be true:\n> \n> **\\0. The circumstances of birth are minimized, ideally removed. One's nationality, ethnicity, parentage/pedigree, neurotype, gender, sex, sexual/romantic orientation should NOT determine one's opportunities in life.** \n> \n> This is achieved through \n> \n> * opening borders (ethnicity, nationality)\n> * free access to quality education, extra-curricular programs, food and shelter as children (welfare, public healthcare, public education (my preferred form is the Austrian, where the child can decide on what they wish to study and attend any school anywhere regardless of parental wealth) (parentage/pedigree)\n> * Abolishment of gender roles (gender/sex circumstances)\n> * Anti-discrimination laws (gender, sex, orientation circumstances)\n> * Screening for neurodivergences, and resources dedicated to accomodate people's impairments so they do not become disabilities while recognizing they are just as intelligent and capable (ADHD kids allowed to have the right amount of stimulation, autistic folk allowed to study through reading over sitting in lectures with consultations, that kind of thing)\n> \n> **\\1. People should be capable of fulfilling their cultural, ethnic, religious, gender, romantic/sexual identities without it negatively affecting their ability to survive.** \n> \n> Caveats:\n> \n> * If fulfilment of identity requires \"traditional gender roles\" for your wife, it can ONLY be done as long as those participating consent (where consent is NOT coerced, ACTIVELY given. Meaning, adult with adult, children cannot be forced into traditional gender roles. Your wife can always stop consenting, and divorce you without justification.)\n> * If fulfilment of identity requires restricting another person's ability to fulfil their own in a reasonable manner. Ergo - having a transgender co-worker in a laboratory does not limit your ability to fulfil your christian identity. Not being able to get hired because you're trans or a sikh DOES limit your ability to fulfil your gender/religious identity. If your religious identity requires the murder of LGBT people, then being barred from murdering them is an acceptable sacrifice of your liberty we can make.\n> \n> **\\2. People should have their basic needs (healthcare, shelter, basic nutrition, privacy) guaranteed regardless of ability to work or socialize or fit in.**\n> \n> **\\3. People MUST have an ADEQUATE access to pursuing intellectual, athletic, cultural and social activities.**\n> \n> * Adequate: Must have free time to do so. For a minimum requirement, we can achieve this through maximizing monthly working hours at 160 hours a month and minimum 25 days paid time off.\n> * Adequate: Must have a way to choose what they want. This can be labour voucher, money, whatever. It should not be decided for them\n> * Adequate: Using whatever representation of value, they should have enough working even a part time job with disabilities to seek personal fulfilment (maybe they won't be able to afford a schooner to pursue historical re-enaction and living history research as a private person, but they can buy books about boats and afford computer simulations, attend a club where they collectively own a schooner for re-enactment).\n\n\nIf you wanna read more about this branch of individualism - I recommend Mikhail Bakunin's \"Revolutionary Catechism\" (Social Anarchism) and John Rawls \"Theory of Justice\" (Social Democracy)", "created_utc": "1660978544.0", "edited": "False", "id": "il1eypf", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_wsgk3x", "parent_id": "t1_il03101", "score": "-1", "subreddit": "OutOfTheLoop", "subreddit_id": "t5_2xinb"}, {"author": "Hoihe", "body": "I havn't had orchieoctomy, yet after 4 years on cypro and estradiol, I can go months without my testosterone going over treshold 2 nmol/l.\n\nSo\n\n*confusion*", "created_utc": "1660977485.0", "edited": "False", "id": "il1dlqm", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_wsr0sg", "parent_id": "t1_il0a7n3", "score": "17", "subreddit": "AreTheCisOk", "subreddit_id": "t5_2g8yh6"}, {"author": "Hoihe", "body": "Yes, in some countries.\n\nBut we alsonhave people actively campaigning against this.

I do not trust such a system, as it relies on a person's ability to influence the community, which naturally forces conformity and punishes those who cannot (for instance: autistic people who lack the ability to employ body language in a way that doesn't have an uncanny effect).\n\nBut as said, it's close enough.", "created_utc": "1660926436.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ikyauhi", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_ws2n3l", "parent_id": "t1_iky8ewo", "score": "1", "subreddit": "CapitalismVSocialism", "subreddit_id": "t5_3cct3"}, {"author": "Hoihe", "body": "High school is NOT exclusively your own degree -\n\nWe have 3 variants:\n\nTrade School, Gymnasium and Trade Gymnasium.\n\nGymnasium is equivalent to U.S H.S.

Religious and civil marriage to be replaced by free marriage. Adult men and women have the right to unite and separate as they please, nor has society the right to hinder their union or to force them to maintain it. With the abolition of the right of inheritance and the education of children assured by society, all the legal reasons for the irrevocability of marriage will disappear. The union of a man and a woman must be free, for a free choice is the indispensable condition for moral sincerity. In marriage, man and woman must enjoy absolute liberty. Neither violence nor passion nor rights surrendered in the past can justify an invasion by one of the liberty of another, and every such invasion shall be considered a crime.\n\n> From the moment of pregnancy to birth, a woman and her children shall be subsidized by the communal organization. Women who wish to nurse and wean their children shall also be subsidized.\n> \n> Parents shall have the right to care for and guide the education of their children, under the ultimate control of the commune which retains the right and the obligation to take children away from parents who, by example or by cruel and inhuman treatment, demoralize or otherwise hinder the physical and mental development of their children.\n> \n> **Children belong neither to their parents nor to society.** They belong to themselves and to their own future liberty. Until old enough to take care of themselves, children must be brought up under the guidance of their elders. It is true that parents are their natural tutors, but since the very future of the commune itself depends upon the intellectual and moral training it gives to children, the commune must be the tutor. The freedom of adults is possible only when the free society looks after the education of minors.\n> \n> The secular school must replace the Church, with the difference that while religious indoctrination perpetuates superstition and divine authority, the sole purpose of secular public education is the gradual, progressive initiation of children into liberty by the triple development of their physical strength, their minds, and their will. Reason, truth, justice, respect for fellowmen, the sense of personal dignity which is inseparable from the dignity of others, love of personal freedom and the freedom of all others, the conviction that work is the base and condition for rights \u2014 these must be the fundamental principles of all public education. Above all, education must make men and inculcate human values first, and then train specialized workers. As the child grows older, authority will give way to more and more liberty, so that by adolescence he will be completely free and will forget how in childhood he had to submit unavoidably to authority. Respect for human worth, the germ of freedom, must be present even while children are being severely disciplined. The essence of all moral education is this: inculcate children with respect for humanity and you will make good men....\n> \n> Having reached the age of adulthood, the adolescent will be proclaimed autonomous and free to act as he deems best. In exchange, society will expect him to fulfill only these three obligations: that he remain free, that he live by his own labor, and that he respect the freedom of others. And, as the crimes and vices infecting present society are due to the evil organization of society, it is certain that in a society based on reason, justice, and freedom, on respect for humanity and on complete equality, the good will prevail and the evil will be a morbid exception, which will diminish more and more under the pervasive influence of an enlightened and humanized public opinion.\n> \n> The old, sick, and infirm will enjoy all political and social rights and be bountifully supported at the expense of society.\n\n\nKey takeway: **Children belong neither to their parents nor to society.** They belong to themselves and to their own future liberty.", "created_utc": "1660925011.0", "edited": "False", "id": "iky749n", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_ws2n3l", "parent_id": "t1_iky2rq6", "score": "1", "subreddit": "CapitalismVSocialism", "subreddit_id": "t5_3cct3"}, {"author": "Hoihe", "body": "For one, I'm infertile.\n\nFor two, we're already way over-populated.\n\nFor three, those children did not choose to be born.

In IDV societies, people are allowed \"to do their own thing\" (Triandis, 1993, p. 159) but in COLL ones, individuals' choices - such as selection of a spouse or a professional career - are often made for them by others, usually senior family members or community elders. Individuals often have no other choice than to conform to the societal rule that dictates obedience and avoid engaging in a costly conflict.\n> \n> Obedience and conformism may sound like alarming societal characteristics.
