Systemic inflammation can wear you down, big time! I\u2019m thinking gluten, but it could be dairy (lactose), or eggs (casein), or even nuts, spinach (oxylates), or beans (saponins), or nightshades (onions, garlic, peppers, eggplant). These are all common allergens / gut irritants.\n\nA constantly annoyed, irritated gut can drain your energy, and you have no idea what\u2019s going on.\n\nSo you need to find out what\u2019s at the root of your systemic inflammation and fatigue.\n\nHere\u2019s how you do it:\n\n1. Pare down your diet *entirely* to this: fatty beef (ground or steak), beef liver 2-3x per week, salt, water, and coffee. No one reacts negatively to red meat (unless you have a tick-borne illness), liver 2-3x per week is super nutritious in terms of vitamins, and you\u2019re used to coffee, otherwise I\u2019d say get rid of that, too. Do that for about 1-3 weeks, *strictly*, and see how you do. If you get the runs (which happens sometimes while adapting to zero carb), add a small bit of avocado to regulate your bowels.\n\n2. If you\u2019re feeling pretty good and you\u2019re adapted to it, add in simple fruit. Bananas. Then berries. Then melons. Then citrus. Then honey. Do this for a week, minimum (2 weeks better). See how your energy levels are. \n\n3. Still feelin\u2019 good? Add eggs. Fry them in tallow, or hard boiled.\n\n4. Not bothered by eggs? Great! Add back in simple non-fruit starches, like *white* rice and potatoes.\n\n5. Still good? Add some chicken into the mix.\n\n6. Still good? Add the fish.\n\n7. Still good? Add the dairy back in. Milk, butter, and cheese. This one might get ya.\n\n8. Still good? Not bothered by milk? Add the gluten. Oatmeal and bread.\n\n9. Still good? Cook your eggs with peppers and garlic.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nI put money on gluten as being problematic culprit for you, but only you can run this experiment and see for yourself.\n\nThe reason strict elimination diets work, is they allow your body to recover for awhile from whatever was bothering it. When you then reintroduce that thing, **WHAM**, you\u2019ll know it and feel it *right away*! \u201cHoly shit! 20 minutes after drinking that glass of milk, my heart rate jumped 20 bpm, *and* I felt like taking a nap! I could barely keep my eyes open! And I started farting a lot! Huh, I haven\u2019t farted at all these past few weeks, and I used to fart all the time!

That\u2019s enough time to deep dive and scratch the itch; then, after those few months, you can decide whether to drop it, back burner it for later, or keep going, without any guilt or FOMO. It also allows you to keep newer interests \u201cin the queue\u201d for the future, without fear that you\u2019ll never get to \u2018em.\n\n2. Keep two \u201cexperiments\u201d running at a time. That way, when you get \u201cbored\u201d with working on one, you can momentarily flip back to the other, and back again, without losing pace or momentum on either. Two at-a-time.\n\n3. Create artificial accountability. For example, I\u2019m currently learning Latin (and it\u2019s become a \u201cpermanent\u201d hobby, lasting more than the span of a single \u201cexperiment\u201d phase). The way I\u2019ve stuck with it, is I do a weekly call on iTalki with a tutor. I don\u2019t *have* to do this in theory, since I can read books and do exercises by myself; but in practice it actually really helps me, because I know that I will feel like an idiot talking to him if I didn\u2019t do my reading and exercises for the week.

There are three general types of people:\n\nAbout 15% of people are GOOD, and will do their best to be honest, make mutually beneficial deals, and do the right thing even when it\u2019s hard to do so. These are the people who are constantly striving to become better people. They are genuine, humble, honest, and kind. They always try to give more than they receive, and leave every place better than how they found it. They have empathy, and integrity.\n\nAbout 15% of people are PERSONALITY DISORDERED, and their only goal in life is to \u201cwin,\u201d at the expense of others if necessary, and they will hurt you in a second if they think they can get away with it. They always, always, always lie, and are constantly curating their public image, while behaving like beasts in private. They are Machiavellian to their core. They can be charming, and they can display cognitive empathy, but have no actual empathy. They don\u2019t care about truth, facts, or evidence, *at all*, only \u201cwinning.\u201d Language for them is just a tool for manipulating others as they navigate life, feeding off of others (energetically, materially, reputationally, &c.) They are vampires. Treat them like you\u2019d handle venomous snakes - only when absolutely necessary, and with EXTREME CAUTION!\n\nAnd the remaining 70% of people are good when times are good, but are sometimes prone to violate their own values when they get scared. They have no real moral center, and are often going with the flow of culture and their surroundings. Sometimes they feel the pain of a lack of an \u201cidentity,\u201d and so they will glom on to some label or another so that they can become a \u201csomebody,\u201d and so they bristle if something they\u2019ve linked their identity to is challenged in any way. This is a gradient, and no one is perfect.\n\nSo my advice to you, is this:\n\n1. Surround yourself with as many people of the first variety as you possibly can! They are hard to find, and they\u2019re a real treasure when you do! *Character matters.* The quality of your life is the sum of the people with whom you spend the most time. This is your primary objective with every type of relationship in your life. \n\n2. Learn to recognize the signs of personality disorders. There are many red flags that, once recognized, can protect you from entering into relationships with lizard people; and strategies you can employ to protect yourself if you must deal with them (e.g., BIFF communication, Grey Rock technique, written documentation, etc.). Google about personality disorders (NPD, BPD, APD) and you\u2019ll begin to learn the red flags and terms used to describe them (e.g., triangulation, narcissistic supply, narcissistic rage, projection, darvo, blame deflection, lack of personal accountability, victimhood narrative, constant gossip, etc.). This new vocabulary will give you fresh insight into manipulative people when you encounter them. If you have someone like this in your life, cut them out of your life completely if you can, and minimize interaction if you cannot. \n\n3. Most people will be in the third category. Treat them with kindness by default, but don\u2019t depend on them too much. A bad turn, and they may lie to you or betray you to save themselves (while feeling genuinely bad about it, but still). Keep one eye open, trust is hard-earned and easily broken. Be kind to them, have fun with them, but don\u2019t divulge too much, too fast, since they\u2019re not first category people.

There\u2019s an infographic out there that shows the relative %-age of linoleic acid / omega 6 in various plant and animal fats (grass-fed tallow the lowest, safflower oil the highest), and lard has a higher percentage of linoleic acid on average than coconut oil, for example (because pigs are monogastric animals, and most are fed corn and soy - pastured lard is hard to find and super expensive, but it has a better omega 3 profile), but lard is still far lower in linoleic acid than safflower oil and peanut oil.

The *unhappiest* couples were the *moderate* couples that existed somewhere in the middle of this spectrum.\n\nThe reason for this, the authors speculated, is that with both very progressive and very traditional homes, task and chore delegation *is very clear and precise*, so there\u2019s very little conflict over \u201cwhat to do\u201d or \u201cwho does what\u201d and \u201cwhen.\u201d In other words, no decisions have to be made when one is feeling tired or stressed - everyone knows what their responsibilities are (\u201cfloor\u2019s dirty, and I\u2019m the vacuum person.

The only way to truly avoid them is to make everything yourself at home, from fresh ingredients, and throw away the bottle of canola oil and crisco. Plus, we\u2019re so trained to fear eggs, tallow, lard, and whatnot. Eek! It completely inverts our notions of what \u201chealthy fats\u201d are. Scary. \n\nThe easiest way to do a metabolic reset is to live entirely on beef, butter, and bananas for a month or two, but only weirdos like myself actually enjoy that sort of minimalism!\n\nFor what it\u2019s worth, going pure carnivore, it took two weeks for my blood pressure to fully normalize. But then it was stable!\n\nBefore carnivore, managing my blood pressure was a constant battle with salt! And it was never fully effective.

That part is awesome, actually.\n\nMy dad suffered from blood pressure issues, and he was on medicine for it, and battled with salt his entire adult life.

Because my blood pressure has been good for so long, it takes two full days of for-real cheating to notice an upward trend, then two days of clean living to correct it! As such, I avoid seed oils altogether, except a few times a year (birthdays, Thanksgiving, Christmas). I do well on that. I don\u2019t want to slip up and let it creep up, because once it\u2019s bad, it\u2019s hard to correct, like I said, two full weeks of beef and water only is what it took for me the first time (and I didn\u2019t know why it worked at first).\n\nI wish y\u2019all the best with this!

Eliminating them eliminated my problem. All variables were adjusted one-at-a-time. Seed oils is what works, consistently. Add them back in, blood pressure goes up. Remove them, blood pressure goes down.\n\nI first stumbled upon this by doing pure carnivore. A diet of only meat fixed my blood pressure. But keto did not. Weird. If it\u2019s not carbs, what could it be, then? Salt? Food sensitivity?\u2026 added back fruit, no change. Added potatoes, no change. Added rice, no change. Added restaurant French fries, uh oh. Hmm\u2026 and I worked it out from there.\n\nAs for seed oils, I mean removing literally any and all pressed industrial oils from the diet: canola oil, cotton seed oil, safflower oil, sunflower oil, corn oil, soybean oil, peanut oil, sesame oil, etc. or anything made from them (margarine, shortening), made with them (crackers, cookies, chips, almond butter, cashew butter, etc.), or fried in them (fast food french fries, restaurant tortilla chips, etc.).\n\nWhat to use instead? *animal fats*, and a few certain select plant-based fruit oils. So my allowed list of fats is as such: tallow, butter, cream, lard, bacon fat, duck fat, schmaltz, fish oil, and a bit of olive oil (*if* not adulterated with canola oil!!!), coconut oil, avocado oil. Palm oil I don\u2019t know about yet. I think it might be ok (environmental impact aside).\n\nMy hypothesis is that a reason that many vegetarians and paleo people with lots of meat both see an improvement in health, is that by removing processed factory snack foods, and replacing them with mostly whole, fresh foods (both groups lay off the Doritos, potato chips, and fast food French fries), one reduces the total amount of industrial seed oils one takes in. Same with a low carb deal, until one starts taking in all the packaged keto snack foods.\n\nWhy does this work? Why are seed oils \u201cbad\u201d? Others can speak to this all better than I can, but, industrial seed oils were not featured *AT ALL* in the human diet until the 20th century, when they were looking for other potential marketable uses for excess cotton seed oil, used as an industrial lubricant at the time.\n\nOver the course of the 20th century, industrial seed oils have comprised a larger and larger portion of a Western diet. Today, for the standard American, seed oils high in omega six comprise the majority of lipid calories. Obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease have increased proportionally in time, nearly 1-to-1. Correlation doesn\u2019t equal causation, but it does merit investigation, I think.\n\nOne hypothesis is that the fats found in nuts and seeds, high in omega six and linoleic acid, acts as a metabolic signal to the body to slow down the metabolism and *store up fat*. When do nuts and seeds usually appear in the wild in large number? Autumn, as mammals are preparing for winter. Linoleic acid could be a \u201cget fat\u201d chemical signal, and normal diets are now flush with it (and traditional diets were not). And we\u2019re all getting fatter and fatter.\n\nFor most of human existence, dietary fat came mostly in the form of saturated fats, higher in omega threes (were not talking CAFOd grain fed cattle, but grass fed wild game, so the omega 3/6 ratio was better), high in stearic acid, very low in linoleic acid. Hunter gatherers get very little dietary linoleic acid. But they *treasure* animal fat!!! Injury, infectious disease, and parasites aside, they\u2019re in WAY better metabolic condition than we are!\n\nEat a few walnuts, fine. Compress and extract the oil out of 100 walnuts into a single snack, and eat the equivalent of that daily, for years, and maybe that leads to metabolic problems in humans? It\u2019s an idea.\n\nIf you want more technical data about all this, Google for \u201cROS hypothesis of obesity\u201d. Fireinabottle.net is a good place to start. A guy was looking for an answer to the French Paradox (\u201cwhy can the French eat rich, fatty, sugary foods and not get fat!?\u201d), and decided to try living entirely on croissants with butter and stearic acid, keeping total calories equal. Body fat was shed quickly. Not just calories in, calories out. Metabolisms are more complex than a single-variable formula!\n\nAnyway, it\u2019s a bit of a rabbit hole, but the science is changing, and one day medicine will catch up (it takes about 20 years I guess). The American Heart Association, in the meantime, has quietly dropped the recommendation to avoid saturated fat as a contributor to cardiovascular disease on their website, promoting weight and blood sugar management as the intervention of choice now. But, regular family doctors are unaware, because change takes time. To them, cholesterol still bad. But, the science today shows little direct association of cholesterol to cardiovascular disease, and tons of association with diabetes and high fasting blood sugar! Metabolism stuff. \n\nMy challenge to you: watch a video on YouTube about how canola oil is made. Then watch a video on how olive oil is made.

So, I\u2019m going at a slow pace.\n\nI got older all of the sudden, so I decided I\u2019d better jump in and tackle it now, before I get older still! It\u2019s always been on my someday to-do list, to be able to read Cicero, Seneca, Tacitus, and such in the original. Plus, I thought it would also be cool to teach the kids (9 and 12) a little bit of Latin as well, just for fun; so we\u2019ve been practicing the basics, and they\u2019ve been having fun with that (it\u2019s a low pressure situation). They know how to conjugate the indicative present tense (ambulo, ambulas, ambulat), and use the first declension accusative and possessive genitive (\u201cPuella lunam spectat\u201d). They love it when they recognize an English word with a Latin root they learned earlier (i.e., \u201cspectator\u201d\u2026, \u201cspecto\u201d Hey!).\n\nI\u2019d like to practice \u201cconversational\u201d Latin with them, but I\u2019m not anywhere near that sort of capability myself, yet. Faaar from it. That\u2019s why I think conversational Latin YouTube videos are so cool. But, hey, I can do little things like \u201cEcce! Vaccae in horto sunt!\u201d and such with them, so that\u2019s a start.\n\nIt\u2019ll take me years to get to where y\u2019all legit folks are at (if I ever manage it at all), but it\u2019s inspiring to see people use it conversationally and so *casually* like that.

And it\u2019s nobody\u2019s business.\n\nSo, on Monero, we\u2019re able to see how many transactions flow through the blockchain, easily. \n\nSpoiler alert: far more than the price reflects right now. XMR is way undervalued, IMO, because it is proving utility by means of consistent everyday use, *as money* (not \u201cstore of value,\u201d or whatever).\n\nIf you read the original Bitcoin whitepaper, and then read Satoshi\u2019s messages from the beginning, it\u2019s pretty obvious that creating an anonymous digital cash was the original desired outcome for Bitcoin, but they just didn\u2019t have the ability or know-how yet to put every feature into Bitcoin in the beginning.

And protecting people\u2019s fundamental rights to privacy and security in personal papers and such requires that sometimes bad guys get away with stuff.\n\nAlso, Monero is private *by default*, but transactions *can* be shared with specific parties, or even publicly, if one wants to (for example, addresses belonging to charities can be public record, just like Bitcoin). I can envision a future whereby a judge issues a warrant (on probable cause with sufficient evidence warranting a probe), and a defendant is required to share their Monero transactions with the court, or face stiffer penalties upon refusal to do so.

In New Testament Greek, for example, the word \u201csin\u201d simply means \u201cmissing the mark,\u201d as in literally an archery term: taking aim at the wrong targets, or taking aim at the right targets and doing the wrong things when pulling the string or firing, or using a crappy bow or shitty arrows, or whatever.\n\nUnder the second definition, sin and evil are merely ignorance, be it true dumb ignorance, or willful \u201cignorance.\u201d So, for example, if someone is selfish and cruel, and they try to \u201cget ahead\u201d by lying, conniving, stepping on others, or even murdering, it may work for them in the short term (they \u201cwin,\u201d and therefore for them it is \u201cgood\u201d), but in the long run it *will* catch up to them, they\u2019ll be destroyed, and they\u2019ll leave a lot of destruction in their wake. They may believe that their Machiavellian approach to life \u201cworks,\u201d but it doesn\u2019t pan out forever, nor does it make them feel fulfilled and happy. They die very miserable and empty. They have \u201csinned,\u201d not because they made God mad and he\u2019s punishing them, or because karma punishes bad and rewards good; but simply because *actions ultimately have consequences,* (action/reaction) and they\u2019ve therefore punished themselves through incorrect (not helpful, to self or others) action, compounding negative interest over time.\n\nStories that are Tragedies (everything from Greek tragedies, to Shakespeare, to *Breaking Bad* or *Ozark*) simply tell the tale of the winding staircase to the bottomless Abyss of Hell. The protagonist doesn\u2019t set out to go to Hell, they set out to solve a difficult problem by violating their values, \u201cjust this one time,\u201d hoping they can \u201cget away\u201d with it.

That\u2019s the nature of \u201csin.\u201d It leads one to Hell through a cascading descending staircase of unwise choices, stacked on top of one another. And the deeper one descends, the more difficult it becomes to fess up and break the cycle. No punishing God directly involved to make Hell happen, no Devil necessary to talk someone into entering - Walter White created his own Hell, by his own choices.\n\nAnd this is what I believe Socrates (or was it Plato?) meant when he said \u201c*to know the good is to do the good*.\u201d Do you think Walter White would have made that first batch of meth in a van if he could have had the wisdom to foresee the ultimate consequences of that pivotal decision?

Whether it\u2019s to prevent them catching disease or parasites from us, or whether it\u2019s to help them feel at ease and more comfortable around us, or even feel like they can more easily trust us, because our clothing and style can signal to them that we share the same basic values.

Instead, they rely on fast legs, hooves, horns, and teeth. I\u2019ll take my chances with that, rather than rolling the dice with strange chemicals, gut irritants, indigestible fibers, and neurotoxins.\n\nAnd even if you do manage to find and process edible or semi-edible plants, you likely won\u2019t be able to extract sufficient nutrition from them to last very long. Meager calories, sparse micronutrients.\n\nBut you can subsist on meat, fat, and organs indefinitely, and they\u2019re very nutrient-dense.\n\nSpend your few remaining calories wisely: sharpen a spear, build some simple traps, make a sling, and hurl some rocks, or fashion yourself an atlatl, and hurl your spear. Or try to grab some fish from a river. This is what all of our ancestors did, and it\u2019s the reason we\u2019re all here now. Even a rabbit - which is small and far too lean on fat to live on solely forever - can sustain you for longer than a few sparse non-toxic or semi-toxic berries or leaves can. Even bugs and grubs are a better bet for your energetic expenditure.\n\nEdit: fun fact, all of the edible plants we buy and consume from grocery stores are from but a small handful of related genuses and species. For example, did you know that kale, spinach, broccoli, cauliflower, asparagus, cabbage, etc. are all cousins and varieties of effectively the same plant ancestor? 99.999% of plant species in the wild are inedible to humans, at various degrees of toxicity. And even grains and beans have to be processed, roasted, and/or boiled in order to not irritate our guts (or, in the case of kidney beans, almonds, \u2019n such, not kill us).\n\nBasically, if you walk out into your yard, or the woods behind your house, you\u2019ll see hundreds or even thousands of varieties of plants, but very little, if anything at all, that you can actually eat. That\u2019s why most of us still rely on animals to filter plant defense chemicals, and convert cellulose and fibers into to the proteins and fats that we can easily process.\n\nWhether we still need to / should rely on animals for food in a modern agricultural civilization is a topic worthy of consideration.

But here are some of the positives:\n\n1. As learning languages go, it\u2019s fucking easy to learn! Basically, the easiest full language there is. As in, you can get a fully-fledged, usable, expressive language under your belt in < 1/5 the time it\u2019s take you to master another language!\n\n2. The grammar is stupid simple. You can learn the entire grammar in an afternoon. The rest is just practice, training the ear, and learning vocab. \n\n3. Word construction in Esperanto is systematic and quite a lot of fun! Don\u2019t know the Esperanto word for something? Chances are, you\u2019ll be able to build it by stacking together the Lego bricks of Esperanto affixes. Your constructed word is always understandable, and, 9 times out of 10, *it happens to be the correct one*.\n\n4. The Esperanto community is quirky and eccentric. The type of person who bothers to learn Esperanto is usually a pretty cool and interesting person.\n\n5. Esperanto has a weird and quirky history. Did you know that Stalin was an Esperantist, years before he sent Esperantists to the gulag? Did you know Hitler targeted Esperanto by name in *Mein Kampf*, and Nazis also murdered Zamenhof\u2019s children? If both Stalin and Hitler are after you, that tells me you\u2019re on to something good. Did you know that Esperanto was almost ratified by the League of Nations as its official language of international diplomacy, short by only one single vote? (Spoiler alert: it was France.) Did you know that Esperanto was briefly the official language of Neutral Moresnet, a.k.a. \u201cAmikejo\u201d (Friendship) before being annexed by Belgium before WWI? Did you know that there are native Esperanto speakers, and that George Soros is one of them? (His father was a famous Esperanto author). And so on!\n\nCool, weird shit!\n\nEsperanto will no longer one day be the world\u2019s official second language (\u201cfina venko,\u201d or, \u201cfinal victory,\u201d is a long-dead utopian dream). But, at this point, that scarcely matters. It\u2019s still fun and ridiculously easy to learn.\n\nIn my opinion, anyone who is a legit polyglot should absolutely learn Esperanto, because, if you know at least one Germanic language, one Romance language, some English, and a smattering of Latin, you\u2019ve effectively got Esperanto for free anyway! Six months and you\u2019ll be very competent with it.

Those are two separate questions which are often confounded and blended).\n\nVegetarianism was sub-optimal for my health, but that\u2019s a different question than animal ethics, isn\u2019t it?\n\nAnyway, I now eat meat, mostly meat, in fact; but I try never to consume factory farmed meat (pastured only) as much as possible, and I want animals to be treated well and kindly while alive, and harvested humanely and with deep respect when the time comes.\n\nAnd I have no problem with hunting, so long as the animal\u2019s body is used (not just decorating your wall), and there\u2019s a \u201cspiritual\u201d sense of gratitude for the animal giving its life for our sustenance, so the skilled hunter aims to kill cleanly and quickly, to minimize the creature\u2019s fear and suffering.\n\n(For example, in Ancient Greece, hunters used to, as I understand it, pray to the goddess Artemis to help steady their hands before taking a shot at a deer, because they wanted a clean, quick kill, and she was the goddess of the hunt, the forest, and guardian of the animals therein. Cruelty or sloppy kills were not valued. I think that\u2019s beautiful, man.)\n\nSo, my current ethic is this: since I\u2019m harvesting a cow, I must treat the cow with respect, and also *strive to make my life better*, more meaningful, more enriching, more kind, more loving, and deeper than the life of a cow. If I don\u2019t do that - if I fritter away my time being a worthless, resentful twat - then I\u2019ve totally wasted that cow\u2019s life. And waste of life, even animal life, is sad. If I understand it correctly, plains Indians in the American West would offer a prayer of thanksgiving to the spirit of Buffalo or Elk, when taking down an animal for use as food, shelter, and clothing. That\u2019s what I\u2019m talking about, more or less.\n\nSo, having (ostensibly) made an unsteady peace with all that, and having adopted an \u201canimistic\u201d / \u201chunter-gatherer spiritual ethic\u201d regarding food animals (they are to be valued and treated with respect), but doing so as a cheeseball privileged American white guy\u2026 being sensitive as I am, I still struggle when I see stuff like this (draining goats and drinking their blood), if I\u2019m perfectly honest.\n\nSeeing videos of people gutting goats, drinking the blood, hunting monkeys, shit like that does still bother me, and forces me to re-examine my choices. Maybe I\u2019m squeamish, maybe I need to become a vegan Buddhist, or maybe I\u2019m just a pussy. But I don\u2019t like hearing animals scream when their throats are cut. For example, I love Liver King (he seems like a cool weird dude and I totally want to be friends with him IRL), but when in one of his videos (I think it was him), the tribal folks he was with in Africa drained the blood of a living animal, I felt pain on the animal\u2019s behalf. Shit hurts your heart when you see and hear that. Was that really necessary? Life is both beautiful and cruel. \n\nI\u2019m still a Saladino-style hunter-gatherer \u201ccarnivore\u201d (meat, organs, fruit, occasional honey), but, I\u2019m also a softie, and I wish I could be as healthy (look, feel, and perform) as well on plant foods as I do on mostly animal foods. I really do. I tried to. But carnivore / ketovore / hard-core Paleo is where it\u2019s at, for human health. Still\u2026\n\nAnyway, just my 2\u00a2.", "created_utc": "1660315650.0", "edited": "1660317393.0", "id": "ik01rb0", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_wmiisb", "parent_id": "t1_ijzmyya", "score": "6", "subreddit": "carnivorediet", "subreddit_id": "t5_hpayg"}, {"author": "be_bo_i_am_robot", "body": "Life pro tip for the future, from a fellow pee-shy man: hold your breath.\n\nBasically, what you do is, you hold your breath, and say to yourself \u201cI will *not* inhale until I\u2019ve peed, *even* if it means I *pass out first*!\u201d.

The point was to create a model that people could use to grow and mature. To become more complete human beings.\n\nYou have certain tendencies and temperaments (introversion, thinking, perceiving, etc.). These represent how you process incoming information about the world and problem solve by default.\n\nBut you are a human being. You have all qualities inside of you.\n\nBut, by having a default temperament, some qualities are underdeveloped. In MBTI terms, the undeveloped aspects of you are your *shadow self* (in your case, ESFJ).\n\nYour shadow self isn\u2019t just an ESFJ, though. Lots of wonderful ESFJs out there. Your shadow self is an *extremely immature, volatile, underdeveloped* ESFJ. Basically, a toddler. Think temper-tantrums.\n\nA \u201cshadow self\u201d tends to come out during periods of high stress. That\u2019s because, when your normal functioning strategies aren\u2019t working, in desperation, your personality sometimes tries the opposite approach. And poorly, because you don\u2019t know how to operate as a mature, effective ESFJ *while under stress.* Remember, your shadow self is a toddler.\n\nThe point of MBTI was to not only show us what our default modes are, but show us what our complementary, underdeveloped qualities are, *so we can develop them*.\n\nThe point of MBTI is to develop ourselves into more balanced human beings. e.g., you may have a natural affinity for introversion, but you can stretch yourself to an extroverted mode of being when necessary, with little problem. Or, you have an perceptive mode of being by default, but you can make yourself process information using a judging mode, when needed.\n\nThe idea, is that with training, self-awareness, and discipline, we can develop our shadow selves during times of no stress, and in the process, over time, move the needle on our temperament towards balance and maturity.

So it sounds like we have a scalability problem. So, we can either try scaling up our hardware, which will probably work, but we'd just run into this problem again in six months, and our resources are expensive because they have to be on-prem (because of HIPAA regulations, we can't go cloud with our architecture in the near future, so AWS, GCP, and Azure are out\u2026); or, we could try refactoring our schemas and offload some of the most frequently-queried data - the results that also doesn\u2019t need real-time updates pushed down to users immediately - into NOSQL databases. But what percentage of our queries fall into that category? I\u2019d have to ask Tim to do an analysis before we could determine if that\u2019s worth it; or we could even just do some cheap hacks with a caching mechanism atop our database - even just some stored procedures that run nightly and store these data types into a static table in the database, or maybe use a separate caching engine. I\u2019m not sure which approach is best, so lessee: a. Scaling up our hardware would work for now, and be relatively simple to do, but it doesn\u2019t solve the problem long-term, because we keep getting more and more traffic over time. So this is just kicking the can down the road, but that might be ok for now. b. Pushing some of our schema to NOSQL or an application cache requires much more development time, and that would be time we\u2019re not focusing on building new features and attacking our back-log of bugs and enhancements. Plus, no one on our team is a NOSQL maven, so we\u2019ll be dipping into new territory, which adds time and complexity, and we don\u2019t have the budget for new hires right now, given our company\u2019s current hiring freeze. c. Adding a caching mechanism between the middleware and the database layer would work, but it\u2019s not elegant, and might not solve our problems long-term, either, and it just adds extra parts to our Goldberg device - the more parts we add, the more stuff can break and more maintenance we have to do\u2026\u201d*\n\nHow would one think about things like *that* without words?! Does one just \"picture\" these things somehow? How?! Mental flowcharts with images instead of words? Feelings about databases and application caches? Weird metaphors? I don\u2019t get it.

In a more strict religious setting, they might be required to read it in its entirety, then quizzed on the facts of the story and told it\u2019s literally true (the Bible is the inerrant word of God), so, believe it, kid.\n\nA young Jew is required to sit down and read the book of Job start to finish, which is difficult material to contend with, and is then asked to think about what it *means*. Why was Job made to suffer like that? What good did it do, if any? Was it senseless suffering, without purpose? Was God cruel, even evil? Is life simply a set of cruel, meaningless tests for the amusement of a capricious, fickle God? Should people worship an unjust God? Does God value blind obedience and loyalty over goodness and justness? Was Job wrong or way out of line to pray and call out to GOD with such earnesty? Was God\u2019s response a just one? Was Satan the bad guy in the story? Who was this \u201cSatan\u201d in the story, exactly, and why did he challenge God regarding humanity\u2019s piety? What did we learn from the story? What does it say about the human condition?\n\nThere\u2019s a reason why young Jews disproportionately grow up to pursue careers in law (medicine also, but that\u2019s another discussion). They\u2019re raised with this sort of literacy and intellectual rigor. It\u2019s baked into the culture.\n\nNot so fun fact: because Jews, generally, had this bad habit of *asking questions of and debating their own scripture*, rather than simply believing it blindly and literally, Christians in the Middle Ages found that cultural propensity to be troublesome. So, the Inquisition was intended to put them in line and set them straight. Martin Luther also found this free-thinking troubling, so he wrote a little book called *\u201dThe Jews and Their Lies\u201d* - a favorite among Nazi acolytes centuries later.\n\nSummary: I\u2019m not Jewish, nor particularly religious. But Jewish literary culture is admirable, and Jews are some of my favorite people. Having been raised mainstream Christian, we weren\u2019t taught to *read* the Bible rigorously so much (encouraged, but not required - as kids, encouragement to read a book doesn\u2019t yield much compliance), as we were asked to listen to and read summaries and snippets, and then simply to *believe* it, because faith is what earns us Gods\u2019s Grace. And logical questions in Sunday school were often hand-waved away with a barely-masked annoyance (\u201cso, like, just how did they get *all* those animal species on an Ark that\u2019s only 400 cubits long and 200 cubits wide?\u2026\u201d).

My first marriage was horrible and abusive. I won\u2019t go into details, but think Amber Heard, to give you a sort of a picture. A real personality disorder abuse situation. Smear campaign, threats, assault, false accusations, the whole nine.\n\nWhen I got out, holed up in my tiny bachelor apartment (where I could have a full night\u2019s sleep *in peace* without being woken up to be screamed at!), I resigned myself to accept always being alone, and I made peace with it. Like, not just intellectual peace, or a theoretical peace tinted with sadness and regret, but a deep, visceral inner peace with it. In my bones. I am cool with this. I\u2019m just gonna focus on what I love to do, and do that.\n\nAnd (at the risk of sounding flakey, woo-woo, or magickal), one day I told the \u201cUniverse,\u201d out-loud, with earnest and intent, that there are certain things I will simply *not* put up with from another person, ever. I had a list. Controlling behavior, drama, lies, neediness, etc. I am done. I will be alone, *happily*, rather than have that in my life ever again, and that\u2019s ok. In fact, that\u2019s **GOOD**. At that moment, when I made my statement of intent, I felt something \u201cclick\u201d inside, like I\u2019d flipped a switch. I was genuinely content, not just content with the idea, but for real. I shed all clinging desire and hole-filling *need* for a relationship. So, I went about my day.\n\nShortly thereafter, out of nowhere, :poof: a relationship with a woman (INFP) just \u201chappened.\u201d Like, there ya go, here\u2019s the perfect woman for you. I, feel, truly, as goofy as it sounds, that I \u201cattracted\u201d the relationship with my *intention* and resolve to not accept anything less, and my \u201cletting go\u201d of clinging to any outcome (I\u2019m cool without it), and *meaning it*.

A person self-actualized like that, not seeking a relationship from anybody, becomes 10,000x sexier overnight.\n\nAnyway, my point is, good things can happen, if you know yourself and go about your business, just living your values, and are clear with yourself what you will accept, and what you will not. Woo-woo stuff aside, I think we\u2019re best suited to have a relationship *when we no longer desire or need one*, if that makes sense. Then, you\u2019re free to meet someone who\u2019s also not needy at all, and you can simply add positivity to each others\u2019 lives if you want, no weird vampire energy or silent contracts or whatever.\n\nIf you\u2019re *genuinely happy by yourself*, you can be happy with someone who\u2019s also happy by themselves, if that makes sense.

They\u2019re attracted to heroes, monsters, swords, robots, spacemen, cars, and laser guns, with no prodding from me.

Obviously, this would sound weird in Esperanto, with *karto* being pronounced \u201ckahtow\u201d as an Englishman might - it sounds similar to *kato* (but the \u201ca\u201d sound here is more open and resonates towards the back of the mouth - alas, EO has only five discreet vowel sounds, so we don\u2019t get this \u201ca\u201d distinction).\n\nWith an American accent, the \u201cr\u201d sound is basically like a *vowel* here, it\u2019s own vowel sound, without any fricative at all; so \u201crd\u201d becomes \u201crrrd,\u201d \u201crt\u201d is \u201crrrrrt,\u201d and so on. Tongue doesn\u2019t flap against or hit anything, just curled up a bit, and vowel-like, \u201crrrrrrrr.\u201d\n\nMany Indian languages, for example, use a vowel \u201cr,\u201d like the word *prak\u1e5bti* in Sanskrit (there\u2019s a bunch of these, but my memory isn\u2019t serving me at the moment). The American pronunciation of the word \u201cchurch\u201d is like this - it\u2019s basically just three sounds, with the \u201cr\u201d being a vowel: \u201c\u0109\u201d \u201c\u1e5b\u201d \u201c\u0109\u201d. No fricatives here - it\u2019s not \u201c\u0109\u201d \u201cuh\u201d \u201cr\u201d \u201c\u0109\u201d or something. Just \u0109\u1e5b\u0109. \n\nAs for \u201ctr\u201d and \u201cdr,\u201d in an American accent \u201cr\u201d is still like a non-fricative vowel, and the preceding consonant can sometimes change a bit (depending on regional accent). So: \u201ctr\u201d in *try* becomes \u201cchrrrrr\u201d as in \u201c\u0109\u201d \u201c\u1e5b\u201d \u201cahy\u201d. and \u201cdr\u201d becomes \u201cjrrrr\u201d as in \u201cj\u201d \u201c\u1e5b\u201d \u201cahy\u201d.\n\nIn an English accent, these two beginning consonant sounds are more clearly annunciated and correct, but the following \u201cr\u201d is still often somewhat non-fricative and \u201cvowel-like,\u201d but a bit more fricative than in American English.", "created_utc": "1656680030.0", "edited": "1656680978.0", "id": "ieg2pei", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_vowif2", "parent_id": "t3_vowif2", "score": "6", "subreddit": "Esperanto", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qo5v"}, {"author": "be_bo_i_am_robot", "body": "Price it into the membership, then.\n\nGet on that.

A lot of them. Maybe even most of them.\n\nOccasionally, though, if I try *real hard*, and raise my awareness and intention to a peak, it seems like I can overcome my biological programming with focused intention. At least a little bit.\n\nSo, then I start buying into Eastern ideas - in a nutshell, that humans are *mostly* driven by impulse and programming (\u201ckarma,\u201d \u201cv\u0101san\u0101\u201d), but with enough determination, practice, and intense focus, one can learn to make more and more conscious, intentional decisions, rather than reactive, instinctual ones.\n\nSo, my guess is that, by default, we\u2019re like 95% meat-robot, 5% free will \u201cminds/spirits,\u201d and that 5% value can go up for the rare few of us who are *really* mindful, intentional, and disciplined, and have our shit together.\n\nI\u2019m working to become one of those intentional people.

The illusion of free will is baked into me anyway, and so was the desire to create more free will by overcoming my programming!\n\nAnd if, by means of my intense discipline, focused intention, mindfulness, and radical overriding of my biological programming, I do eventually become a more a conscious and intentional individual, and a better and more well-rounded, less-reactive human being; well, perhaps those intents, purposes, and beliefs were programmed into me in the first place, but\u2026 it doesn\u2019t matter, because they still \u201cworked,\u201d whether \u201cI\u201d did it, or \u201cnature\u201d did it through the illusion that I call \u201cme.\u201d It still worked, so\u2026\n\nIf that\u2019s the case, that my free will is illusory, even my default 5%, well, ain\u2019t nothing I can do about it anyway.

This is due to a change in gut microbiome, adapting to sodium balance / water retention, all that. \n\nIt might not, but, if this happens to you, the following can help:\n\n1. Avoid excess really hot beef fat (e.g. hamburger grease) in the beginning. That seems to run right through some people until they adapt. Strain it off a bit at first. Ground lamb is even worse. Avoid ground lamb burger until you\u2019re fully adapted, and/or cut it with a leaner meat (like bison) as well.\n\n2. Weirdly, cooler fats (not so hot off the skillet) seem to run a bit slower through a person, for some reason. I don\u2019t know why. If you need more dietary fat, but hot beef fat blasts through you, try adding butter (if you can tolerate dairy), or letting the beef fat cool a bit before eating it. Slightly warm fat is easier on the tummy than hot fat it seems. At least it was for me (I\u2019m fully adapted now, though).\n\n3. If you\u2019re really struggling, and you don\u2019t want to rely on daily Imodium while your gut microbiome adapts to the change in macronutrients and salts, a bit of avocado can help. Animals are food, plants are medicine. Avocado is relatively high fat and low carb (for a fruit), and has juuuust enough fiber to slow down the poop train a bit. It helped me a great deal during the first couple weeks. Honestly that\u2019s what helped me stick with it.\n\nAnd finally: Eat liver (and heart), because it\u2019s so fucking good for you! If you don\u2019t like the taste, serve it mixed with cubed streak or\u2026 blend it with hamburger (80% meat / 20% organs) and you won\u2019t even know it\u2019s there.", "created_utc": "1655737097.0", "edited": "1655737328.0", "id": "id2ddtt", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_vg1zgd", "parent_id": "t3_vg1zgd", "score": "2", "subreddit": "carnivorediet", "subreddit_id": "t5_hpayg"}, {"author": "be_bo_i_am_robot", "body": "He also has downloadables on his website: a comprehensive spreadsheet and audio files for tables memorization, and he\u2019s very careful and precise about pronunciation.

I don\u2019t share my problems and feelings \u201cjust because.\u201d I keep that shit close to the chest unless I\u2019m stuck and have run out of ideas.\n\nOne of the most annoying things, for example, of going to a therapist (many moons ago during a difficult time in life), was the fact that all he did was *listen to me*. Even when I asked directly, he offered no potential solutions: no exercises to try, no workbooks to read, no models to consider, no techniques to experiment with, nothing. Just \u201cuh huh, yeah, that must feel terrible.\u201d What a waste of time and money!\n\nAlas, everyone isn\u2019t like me, and so I\u2019ve learned and accepted that not everyone wants solutions right away, and some people just want an empathetic audience at first, and that simply listening *is* often times a partial solution for them (salving emotional tension and overwhelm). Often times the problem-solving can happen only after the emotions are cooled off a bit, and listening is the tool to help with that preliminary process.\n\nSo, when helping others, I try to first be in strictly \u201clistening mode,\u201d and then, when the time is right (when the simply listening has done it\u2019s job), try to switch over to \u201cproblem solving mode,\u201d when they\u2019re open to it, so I can actually help them fix a problem.\n\nOf course, if they *never* want to switch to problem-solving mode, then they\u2019re just complainers and perpetual victims, and that\u2019s a waste of everyone\u2019s time and energy.\n\nThe trick is in discerning the difference between someone who needs to \u201cvent\u201d to release excess emotional pressure before they can problem-solve, vs those who just want to complain and always remain a victim forever because it gets them attention.

Because, there\u2019s another factor: *self-control*. I often don\u2019t have the ability to take in a moderate amount of carbs regularly, because my brain sucks at producing enough dopamine. I tend to binge hyper-palatable foods.\n\nMy wife, for example, can eat *a* cookie. I cannot. I eat *all* the cookies.\n\nSo now I don\u2019t eat cookies.\n\nFor example, paleo wasn\u2019t as successful for me as it could have been, because I gorged myself on figs, dates, bananas, berries, dried apples, sweet potatoes, cashews, almonds, almond butter, etc. I could put away a pound or two of trail mix in one sitting, easily, or throw back four or five bananas just because, or gobble up an entire box of figs. Figs have a *ton* of sugar. I love sugar, and it\u2019s a problem. I\u2019d binge on the \u201chealthy\u201d sugars, then would creep out from there to the junk. \u201cOh, these gluten-free potato chips are made with avocado oil, so they\u2019re paleo. I\u2019ll eat *all* of them, right now. Oh, these Oreo-like cookies are gluten-free. Ok, they\u2019re almost paleo, and now they\u2019re gone. Welp, I slipped up, so I\u2019m having these donuts then. Shit, there\u2019s a large bag of hard candy life savers. They\u2019re gone now.\u201d\n\nMy only slip-up on carnivore was eating an entire bag of dried apple chips. Because I\u2019d set out to try just one.\n\nI\u2019ve done drugs, and drugs don\u2019t \u201cdo\u201d it for me, at all. Sugar is where it\u2019s at.\n\nKeeping my food *boring*, constant, and high-satiety most of the time seems to help a LOT. Just meat, and 1 tbsp honey 2x per week as a treat. Ground beef and egg yolk for lunch, every single day. So maybe a lot of this is just using fat and protein to bypass reward mechanisms that are usually hyper-triggered by sweets and starches.\n\nMaybe it\u2019s ketones, I dunno. Keto did better for me than paleo, but not as well as this. Maybe all the sweet \u201cketo\u201d treats were fucking me up. Maybe it was the sugar alcohols, or the seed oils (tons of almond butter and so on). I don\u2019t know.\n\nThe trick for me is, to not be eating any of that shit. It\u2019s like crack, one hit and I can be gone. Even playing around with honey feels dangerous. And sliding up past the 50-100g per day point 2 days in a row or more seems like it could be an \u201cactivator.\u201d So I\u2019m scared to titrate the carbs up, as you can see.\n\nIf I stick to fatty meat and organs, I tend not to attack sweets, even if they be blueberries and bananas. And that\u2019s good. Because I will destroy blueberries. \n\nI\u2019m also allowing myself a diet soda (sugar-free Monster) every once in a while, when the sugar craving really hits, and that feels like playing dice with Satan; but, so far, so good.

(I tried this for blood pressure, not weight control).\n\nI throw in a bit of carbs one meal 2x per week (e.g., some honey, some fruit, maybe a bit of rice or v8 juice - still \u201clow carb\u201d by mainstream standards\u2026), and my blood pressure remains steady and healthy! No meds necessary.\n\nIt took about 2 weeks of this diet for my blood pressure to stabilize, but now it\u2019s golden and picture-perfect.\n\nIt\u2019s always normal range now, but, weirdly, it creeps up ever-so-slightly on zero-carb days, and then is at it\u2019s lowest the morning after a carb \u201cre-feed.\u201d These results are consistent and repeatable, which is why I have a few carbs 2x per week.

Effectively zero carbs (occasionally I\u2019ll have honey, seasonal berries, or a tuber to replenish my glycogen).\n\nMy body feels, looks, and performs *much* better now than it ever has in my entire life! Body fat has melted away, fast. My biomarkers are superb. My strength, alertness, and mood are all up. ADHD symptoms are way down. My systemic inflammation is way down. My sleep is better. My cardiovascular fitness is better. My blood pressure is now normal. Etc etc. This is how our ancestors (when they could) ate, for a reason. \n\nBut yes, I don\u2019t like killing animals, even though, as food, they treat me far better than plants (and certainly processed foods) ever did. So how do I square that circle?\n\nI\u2019ve just made peace with the fact that:\n\n1. Plants do not \u201cwant\u201d us to eat them. That\u2019s why they make tons of chemicals as a defense mechanism. 99.9% of plants on planet earth are inedible to humans, due to their chemical warfare. And many of the ones that are edible for us, have to be prepared in a specific way in order to be edible, by destroying certain compounds (i.e., roasted, boiled, fermented, etc.). Try eating a raw cashew, or raw potatoes, or raw beans, for example.\n\n2. Animals (mostly) don\u2019t use chemical defenses, but claws, teeth, horns, and hooves to avoid being eaten. The meat inside (the organs especially) are the most nutrient-dense food substances on planet earth. This is why hunter-gatherers go for the liver, heart, spleen, marrow, etc. *first*.\n\n3. Every animal that lives here on planet Earth *has* to take a life, in some form, from something else in order to live. That\u2019s just how it is, as ugly and awful as it is. It\u2019s the reality of life here.\n\n4. I acknowledge that taking the life of a carrot, a potato, or even a shrimp, feels *way* different than taking the life of a cow or an elk. Man, I get it.\n\n5. After a successful hunt, in a traditional hunter-gatherer setting, there are powerful emotions that set in - a simultaneous sense of momentary sadness, but also an immense sense of immediacy (being 100% in-the-moment), and **GRATITUDE**. When the beast is brought down, you understand that the animal gave its life in order to give life to you and your family/tribe. One feels an outpouring of gratitude and love for the animals. This is why hunter-gatherers honor and venerate the spirit of these animals - it\u2019s not like industrial meat industries where you\u2019re so disconnected from your source of food. There is zero real gratitude when a burger ends up on your plate from a fast food restaurant or store shelf seemingly by magic. We\u2019re so disconnected from everything that happens on our planet. That is why I don\u2019t eat animals from industrial farming operations - local regenerative agriculture only, or ethically hunted animals, wherever possible.\n\n6. I eat mostly animals, and when I do, I feel a deep sense of gratitude. It sounds ridiculous and spiritual, but I thank the animal, every time. I also feel that, since an animal sacrificed its life to sustain mine, that I *must* resolve to live my life as best, as courageously, and an honorably as I possibly can! I cannot waste this life. It is my responsibility to squeeze the most juice out of it as i can. I must do *everything* that I can to make sure that my life, and the lives of my family, are far better than the life of a cow. It imbues my meals with a deep existential sense of purpose, intention, meaning, and seriousness. Something that\u2019s completely missing from modern life.\n\nI don\u2019t know if any of this makes sense. And maybe I\u2019m a bit of a nutter.

They can use the bathroom any time they want without asking permission.\n\n4. Reading counts for time! I tell my kids that \u201cnobody actually \u2018teaches\u2019 you anything - you teach yourself anything you want or need to know! Good teachers are coaches - they help, but you\u2019re doing the work.\u201d So, when they\u2019re interested in something, we head to the library! Right now, my oldest is reading Norse myths, and my youngest about astronomy, because that\u2019s their jam right now. They actually *like* learning!\n\n5. We drill math in the evenings. Math is always the biggest challenge, but they\u2019re crushing it.\n\n6. Learning time can consist of any number of activities. If we go to a museum or watch a documentary on the weekend, it counts.\n\n7. I subscribe to an online self-paced school thing for them as well. We treat it as supplemental. If we get too busy to teach effectively, they do their computer school. I\u2019ll say \u201cI\u2019m busy today. This morning, do one math session and one science session online. If you finish before lunch, you can monkey around or do Minecraft after that.\u201d And they do. They\u2019re really good about it.

Honestly reading a book is better than a classroom much of the time.\n\n9. All they have to do, is a) meet the time requirements (but it\u2019s just an affidavit, with checkboxes for each day), and b) they have to pass the state proficiency exam at the end of the year at certain ages. My boys crush that exam (99th percentile in reading, language, history, etc., respectable in math and science). Also, they\u2019re the only kids around here who can name every single (non-tiny-island) country on an unlabeled world map, know much of the periodic table, read WELL beyond their \u201cgrade level,\u201d have a vocabulary larger than many adults, know a pinch of Python, and can read a wee bit of Latin. Homeschool is awesome.\n\n10. Work from home means I\u2019m not tied to a strict schedule either. If I want to take 2 hours midday to drill math with them, I do it!

The Latin course there is short, but ok. Don\u2019t expect miracles.\n\n6. When you\u2019re ready, buy a few hours of coaching time on iTalki.

MBTI is just a model. All models are wrong, but some models are useful, & can even approximate reality as we experience it, in certain circumstances. Objective reality is far greater and more nuanced than our tiny models can ever account for. But they do help us navigate the world more easily and effectively. Good models tend to *work*. That\u2019s what makes them \u201cgood\u201d models.\n\n2. The traits & qualities described by MBTI are not binary (e.g., \u201cyou\u2019re either a Thinker or a Feeler\u201d), but each exist on a spectrum.\n\nNo one is a pure Introvert or pure Extrovert, although a few people do linger at the extremes.\n\nSame with T/F.\n\nAnecdote: My wife is INFP, and I\u2019m INTP. We share many of the same core values, and ways of thinking. We get along extremely well! We vibe. We also differ in a few key but notable ways.\n\nBut, I\u2019d estimate, that on the T/F spectrum, she\u2019s probably hanging around at 30/70, and I at 70/30, *most of the time*. But also, these values adjust depending on context and circumstances. She turns up her T at work, for example, and her J, and I turn up my E and J. Compared to how we are at home.\n\nJung taught that these qualities are *flexible*. We\u2019re capable of embodying *an*y way of being, if we choose and/or need to: but, like rubber bands, we tend to \u201csnap back\u201d to our \u201cdefault settings\u201d most of the time, when circumstances are baseline. Pulling ourselves away from our baseline is a *stretch*, VERY uncomfortable when imposed upon us; but, if we do it slowly, regularly, and intentionally ourselves, expanding our comfort zone as a conscious *exercise*, we grow *bigger* and *more capable* as people. We can stretch more, and for longer, when circumstances demand it of us.\n\n3. The primary *goal* of MBTI wasn\u2019t just to help us understand people (although it is great at that, although Big 5 might arguable be a better model); MBTI was designed to help people learn to recognize, embrace, and **intentionally** *embody* our *opposite* traits (when appropriate to do so), so we can all become more balanced, mature, whole human-beings. More capable, more empathetic, more adaptable to different circumstances (e.g., a natural introvert can learn to consciously \u201cturn on\u201d his extroversion at a dinner party without breaking himself emotionally while doing so, or whatever).\n\nA \u201cperfect\u201d person would be infinitely adaptable, wouldn\u2019t they? We can never be perfect, of course, but we can grow, and become more conscious and intentional, and less instinctive and reactive. We can become less \u201canimal\u201d and more \u201cspirit\u201d over time. That\u2019s the point.\n\nI don\u2019t know if I described this well or not.", "created_utc": "1650909777.0", "edited": "1650910514.0", "id": "i65ra4d", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_ubmlab", "parent_id": "t3_ubmlab", "score": "1", "subreddit": "mbti", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s90r"}, {"author": "be_bo_i_am_robot", "body": "YES SQL OMG", "created_utc": "1650901598.0", "edited": "False", "id": "i655rvi", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_ubj77x", "parent_id": "t1_i64wsmx", "score": "4", "subreddit": "ProgrammerHumor", "subreddit_id": "t5_2tex6"}, {"author": "be_bo_i_am_robot", "body": "I don\u2019t know if the following is a good metaphor or not, but here it goes:\n\nWhen learning something new, I have found that abstract intellectual skills (science, history, coding, writing, math, chess) are picked up and acquired a lot faster than purely physical skills, or combination physical/intellectual skills (soccer, jiu jitsu, basketball, guitar, drums, needlecraft, carpentry, &c.).\n\nThis is because, at least for me, the body learns stuff *far slower* than the mind does. The mind understands things right away, and remembers quickly. The body is stubborn, and requires repetition and *drilling, drilling, drilling*. But then, one day, with enough persistence, it just \u201cclicks,\u201d and the body now knows it, on a deep cellular and visceral level, pretty much forever. Instinct and physical memory take over.\n\nBut to get to that point is a difficult slog.\n\nHere\u2019s where it gets weird: I thought language learning would be a purely intellectual exercise. Learn grammar, learn words, memorize, practice, boom. But I feel the same difficult, stubborn \u201cresistance\u201d in retaining a language skill as I do from learning physical endeavors.\n\nI think, although it\u2019s not obvious, that language learning is a combination physical/mental skill, much like Brazilian jiu jitsu. Mind and body.\n\nI think the part of language learning that\u2019s supposed to eventually become \u201cinstinctual\u201d and \u201cautomatic\u201d is a **physical** skill that requires incessant and lengthy drilling, until the body takes over, so the mind doesn\u2019t have to \u201cthink\u201d about it anymore. Kinda like riding a bike (but much harder). You can think about other things while riding a bike, because your feet and hands know what to do already. But it wasn\u2019t that way when you were starting out!\n\nWhich, if you think about it, reading (eyes), listening (ears), and speaking (mouth) are all physical activities. They\u2019re our body interacting with the physical world (like riding a bike, grappling, or playing music).\n\nAnyway, I don\u2019t know if I expressed this idea very clearly.
