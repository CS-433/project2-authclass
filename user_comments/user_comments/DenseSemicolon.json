I absolutely agree that being rude is no way to make a bond and improve in your target language. I think there are kinder ways of looking at it and managing it and a lot of nuances:\n\n* Even if people switch, you made the effort! Take it as a learning experience and move on. It takes practice and learning to be able to keep going past the switch.\n* Sometimes it is the hint of an accent that gets people excited, combined with maybe an awkward phrase/atypical word choice/tinge of anxiety. I have a tiny accent (vaguely Anglophone) that pops up in French (it embarrasses the hell out of me) and when that happens, Francophones will sometimes do their best in English. I'll reply in French, the conversation goes on in both French-English, we're both pretty happy.\n* My students often fear that a language switch could indicate that they're \"too stupid\" in the language and that they'll never get the opportunity. Everything takes time and practice, but I also tell them to use a polite phrase in the TL: \"I'm studying TL and would really like to practice as much as I can. Do you mind if I continue in the TL or is it easier if I speak English?\" The TL speaker can then respond with their comfort level.\n* Like others said, some people are HYPED to practice their own language skills, e.g. a French person hearing a US accent and being excited to speak English. \"If you'd like, I can speak my TL and you can speak your TL, do you want to do that?\" I've done this exchange several times and it really allows people to connect and learn from each other.\n* \\[I switch one nasty phrase around for another. Accents are like vital organs - we've all got them. While we can work on them to the best of our ability, there's nothing inherently shameful in having an accent!\\]\n* Unfortunately, linguistic switches can also be a matter of exclusion, whether it's conscious or unconscious. I'm thinking for example of the \"No em canvi\u00efs la llengua\" movement \\[Don't switch languages with me\\] in Catalonia. People who are judged to be \"foreign\" or \"outsiders\" sometimes have native Catalan speakers switch to Castilian. The implication is that someone who looks or sounds \"foreign\" (and especially someone who isn't light-skinned) is inherently unable to speak Catalan well. This switch happens even if the supposed \"outsider\" is a citizen or born and raised in Catalonia and even if they're a proficient speaker of Catalan. This is a matter of politics, of choosing who \"belongs\" and who doesn't - a lot of complexity beyond how proficient you are in speaking.", "created_utc": "1663352466.0", "edited": "False", "id": "iop48e2", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_xfuajm", "parent_id": "t3_xfuajm", "score": "33", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "DenseSemicolon", "body": "Depends on the pill!

If you aren't already supplementing with a grammar book or with an instructor, this is a good time to do that. And if Anki works for you and you see a recurring grammar mistake, I'd set up a question like \"is it *je bois le th\u00e9* or *je bois du th\u00e9* and why is that choice better?\" You could reinforce it with small changes like, \"How would I say *in the morning I usually drink hot chocolate? coffee? water?*\"\n\nYou can do this for any grammar structure, whether or not you've had trouble with it. Time and practice will make errors less recurrent.\n\n\\*This is a common trait in speaking in French for novice learners. You can use the partitive DU TH\u00c9 to say you are having SOME TEA; *le th\u00e9* means a very specific tea or the concept of tea itself.", "created_utc": "1662747953.0", "edited": "False", "id": "inrb0xr", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_xa1hp8", "parent_id": "t3_xa1hp8", "score": "5", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "DenseSemicolon", "body": "uj/ the damage the CEFR scale has done to language learning boards \ud83d\ude29", "created_utc": "1662653530.0", "edited": "False", "id": "inlsnjv", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_x89oot", "parent_id": "t3_x89oot", "score": "4", "subreddit": "languagelearningjerk", "subreddit_id": "t5_37rt5"}, {"author": "DenseSemicolon", "body": "Getting through day 5 of VLCD and finally feeling my energy come back, thank you sodium horse pills!

Keep seeking out TL material in videos, podcasts, etc. See how much you can follow without using a dictionary or trying to translate into your native language, and look up words or ideas you don't know. It's especially helpful at the mid/high beginner stage to have subtitles or transcripts, or even transcripts in the TL and your own language side by side. As you continue to learn grammar, structure, and vocab, you'll be able to see how speakers build sentences, express ideas or opinions, or why they used one structure and not another, etc.\n\nOne thing that helped me was to pick videos/audio on topics that were related to my own interests. So that could be sports, or baking, or basket weaving, up to you! Sometimes you can find videos designed for learners at your specific level, but it's also fun to find \"authentic input\" from native speakers of the TL. In the latter case this can sometimes help you push through to the next level. Pay close attention to how they build ideas and sentences, word choice, etc. - it might help to repeat after the speaker or sub in your own vocab or ideas.\n\nLet's say in a video for example the speaker said \"Usually I don't like tomatoes, but in this salad they were really good.\" Once you understand what the speaker is trying to express, you might try your own sentences. \"Usually I don't like blueberries, but in this cake they were really good.\"  (The output might not be accurate - but you can always try it out when you're actually talking to someone, and then see if they suggest a better way to phrase your idea.)\n\nI don't know if there is \"too much output,\" just output that you might not be ready for just yet. You might not be ready to give an academic talk in your TL, but you could definitely seek out a tutor, try to meet TL speakers, or travel to areas where the TL is spoken.

There are a couple of simple compositions.\n\n\\-  French 2: introduces the past tense (pass\u00e9 compos\u00e9 and imparfait), more vocabulary, some more complicated grammar. This is when we start IPAs which involve reading (simplified) French articles and listening to short videos. There are a couple of compositions in the exams and one that you complete during the course.\n\n\\- French 3: introduces future, conditional, subjunctive, more phrases.

He seems to be better now, but he's always going to need a carer of some kind - I don't know that he'll be able to go back to school or follow his dreams of being a musician.\n\nAlso, as a grad student I can relate to a lot of what you're describing. When you are trying to compete, be the best, stay alive in an institution that doesn't care about you, you'll do or take anything. Something to help you focus and something to push away the constant anxiety of your existence. We are all caught in our worlds - faculty in theirs - that we sometimes forget to check in on each other and take care of one another (or even ourselves). I've seen friends, and I've seen professors, sacrifice their physical and mental health for the sake of their research. I wish we could do better. I wish the humanities, in my case, were more humane. But it's going to take much more work on all of our parts to make that possible. Particularly from faculty and admin, particularly in terms of the \"grindset\" and exhaustion of existing at the margins. I don't know if this \"awareness\" would've prevented this situation, but I just wish things were different.

It's hard to be on the grind all the time and in the end, that shouldn't be the only thing you're doing for yourself. Like others said, the idea of what \"happiness\" is might leave you feeling unfulfilled - there isn't really a point where you're like \"yup, this is the pinnacle, I got all the achievements in life.\" Not when you win something, not when you get into grad school, not when you get all your degrees, not when you hit any milestone. You also have to remember to take care of yourself and nourish your mind - outside of the grind and outside of the schedule.\n\nMake sure to do something for yourself that has nothing to do with workouts, class, or your job. Productivity alone isn't gonna make you feel fulfilled. A lot of times it feels like you're working just to work. Volunteer in a capacity that works for you. Find a hobby that makes you explore - maybe you need to meet with a group to talk about a project, maybe you need to go to a special grocery store to get the ingredients for your newest recipe. Go for a walk in a part of LA you've never explored before. Read about something that interests you that isn't related to homework. Get into it, like way into it. It doesn't even have to be a social thing with student friends. If your friends are anything like mine, sometimes you're waiting for everybody to agree and organize themselves enough to get out. Just do things for **you** and the folks you care about and want to help, not just for your r\u00e9sum\u00e9 or your transcripts or your work experience or your stats or whatever measures we all put up for ourselves.\n\nI kind of started to feel like this in undergrad, around my sophomore year. I'm editing this to be blunt. I was not taking care of myself. I always felt like I wasn't doing enough, I always felt unfulfilled, I always felt alone and stuck in my schedule between classes, work, organization activities, socializing that wasn't fulfilling. There was no time for me to take care of **myself** because I wasn't making that time - there was too much work in my mind to allow myself that luxury. With all the grinding I was doing, I was making no time to **be myself** and enjoy things in a way that was authentic to me. My room was a mess. I was a mess.\n\nI had really dark thoughts and I ended up taking myself to my campus' CAPS. I was diagnosed with high-functioning depression. But I think a lot of us feel like this, whether we're diagnosable or not. If you talk to somebody or get referred out, a counselor or therapist might also help you talk through what you're feeling and move you to the next step. If it helps you at all to know this, I was able to learn different coping skills and self-care skills, and I decided against meds for the time being. However you learn to live with yourself, know you're the one in control - and you can make life meaningful, even if it isn't \"fulfilling\" or \"happy\" the way society makes us feel we need to aspire to.\n\nOr maybe I'm just writing this to keep myself accountable for my own wellness, lol.
