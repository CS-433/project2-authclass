The majority white ones? Because I know for sure dog meat is a thing amongst some native American tribes, African communities and of course, Pacific Asia.\n\nSee here's the interesting thing: Civilizations whose development was based on hunting and especially herding sees dogs as companions, because dogs help them move sheep herds and hunt other animals.\n\nOur society isn't like that though. We are farmers who grow rice. We don't need dogs to get food the way hunters and herders do. We have the climate to just grow our main source of food since a long long time ago already.\n\ntldr:\n\ncold dry weather -> crops don't grow well in winter -> hunt big animals/heard animals -> need dog companion -> dog meat bad.\n\nhot humid climate ->  rice field -> grow your food and feed yourself with the help of buffaloes/cows instead of dogs -> dog meat ok, steak not ok (looking at you India)\n\nAlso:\n\ncold climate -> melanin not needed because sun not too hot -> white people\n\nhot climate -> melanin needed or else the sun kills you -> non-white people\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou see how this is a cultural/racial issue and that your culture/race's view towards dog meat is not shared by many other cultures/race?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Do you see people leash a pig and take a walk in a prak?\n\nI actually have, not in a park but I have seen pet pigs. Pigs are literally smarter than dogs actually and [they could be trained for so many different task the way dogs are.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHOfUBJyLrQ&ab_channel=America%27sGotTalent) It's just that pigs are smart, but also easy to put on weight. So it's decided that they have to be slaughtered instead of being loved, just because they are fat.\n\nSo again, why do you think it's ok to eat pigs and not dogs? They are both intelligent creatures capable of forming bonds with humans. Do you see the hypocrisy now?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit:\n\nI want to add that for most of Vietnamese dynastic history, it was illegal to eat beef/buffaloes, as they are pivotal in the production of rice. That's why most Viet food don't include beef until French colonial times, when beef Pho got invented. And even at the time, the focus on bone broth in Pho stem from the fact that butchers would sell the actual cow meat to the rich French who can afford it, while the natives got left with bones.", "created_utc": "1666650784.0", "edited": "1666665705.0", "id": "itndrvx", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_yc7s2x", "parent_id": "t1_itn3qq5", "score": "13", "subreddit": "VietNam", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qkcr"}, {"author": "RemoteAnalysis3809", "body": ">It is absolutely a privilege to be able to care for animal rights.  \n>  \n>That's why there's such a stark difference between official policies regarding animal rights in developed and developing countries.

In the US, when you eat out, you pay for service, sanitization and amount.\n\nThat's why people tip servers in the US, while in Vietnam, if you even tip at all, the person you tip is the main cook, who usually sits at the front of the store.

Their only job is to facilitate the relationship between guests and kitchen, ie get your order fast and correctly, then deliver the food to you. So no \"checkups\" while you're eating, no refills, no small talk. If you want their attention then you raise your hands/call for them.\n\nSo when I first came to the US, I felt weirded out by American serving style.

Everything will always seem ok at the start of your journey in a new country. For me it was things like \"Oh it's so freeing to have this level of independence\".\n\n The mental drop happens when you start to notice the negative aspects of this social value mismatch between the society you grew up in and the society you are now part of.

I didn't even know the importance of chosing a health insurance, let alone that your healthcare is attached to your employer when I first came, and I certainly didn't know what therapy is or why so many Redditors (majority American social media platform) seek it.

They are native English speaker because they grow up with **naturally-occurring** social environment that enable language acquisition at a young age, since Singapore's official language includes English. \n\nThis is like my example with native Viet speakers who are native because they grow up in Viet town. It's not the parents, it's the **holistic social interactions with many members of society, in different social context, starting at a young age**, that determines your native level. That's why generally, kids immigrating at a young age can easily learn the new language of the place they just moved to, while their parents don't.

I'm not sure that makes much sense.\n\nThe homeschool scenario is not a good one, as schooling implies there's reading materials, videos, lectures, etc. all of which requires you to interact with materials written/spoken in a language that isn't \"homely\", even if it's with your parents teaching you.

Actively study Vietnamese through tutors and classes the way I study English as a second language.\n\n2. Were born and raised in a *community* of Vietnamese speakers (Little Saigon, Viet town, Orange County, etc.) where they use Vietnamese to communicate with other Viet people to trade, buy groceries, order food, read newspapers, visit dentists, etc. \n\nMost times it's even both, since living in a community of Viet people allow you to organize language classes much better. \n\nImagine a textbook containing all the scenarios in which your TL is used.

Most English native speakers learn languages for fun, for cultural appreciation, consume media etc. Most other people learn languages for professional development, immigration, etc. not just \"casual\" motivations like most English native speakers I know do. \n\nSo the learning attitude is entirely different. Imagine if you can at least tripple your pay if you know a language to a B2 level. That's how a lot of people where I'm from sees it. For example, my Chinese tutor day job is to be an accountant in a import-export business between Chinese and Vietnamese companies. He makes great money by being able to read Chinese documents for his work.\n\nAnother example is, my father is a Vietnamese man working for a Japanese company in Vietnam. He knows if he gets his Japanese to a high level, he can actually talk to his Japanese boss, and gain better opportunity to advance in his career. Japan is the biggest investor in Vietnamese infrastructure right now, so many people in Vietnam are learning Japanese online and in language center for this reason. \n\nOthers also do it for a chance to work in Japan. Many people know Japan has an aging population, but I think most don't know it has imported millions of legal foreign workers from Vietnam and other SEA countries for manual labor. These workers often need some level of language proficiency to do their work, so that's where the interest is. \n\nSimilar things can be said about the interest in Korean from Vietnamese women in particular. \\~4% of marriages in the past 10 years in Korea is between Korean men and Vietnamese women. It's a weirdly high ratio because these older Korean men could pay their way to get a bride from Vietnam \"shipped\" to them. Before they leave Vietnam, the women are often getting some form of language education from their \"match-making agency\", or straight from the Korean Embassy. There are lots of problem with these kinds of situations, because it is human trafficking imo. At the same time, it's pretty common in poorer areas of my country. Young girls there love K-pop and K-drama because it's a common fantasy for teenage girls from impoverished background. You can imagine how match-making agencies can take advantage of that. \n\nIn my personal case, it's English. \n\n80% of academic journals are written entirely in English.\n\n55% of the internet's content is in English.\n\nMost programming tutorials and books are written in English. \n\nI was born and raised in Vietnam and currently work in tech in the US. When I was a 6yo child in Vietnam, my mom taught me English grammar, while paying for native speakers to talk to me on a weekly basis so I have a more North American accent. I hated language learning as a kid because it was forced on me. \n\nBut then I became really good at it. And now I do it voluntarily in my own time because I have reaped the benefit of knowing this language really well. I make more money than most people on Earth now largely because I was forced to spent my childhood learning English to an extremely high level while benefiting from the education system at home in Vietnam where Math was highly prioritized. \n\nAnyways, that's a long-winded explanation of how a difference in motivation can create vastly different experience learning languages for different people from different background.", "created_utc": "1661303909.0", "edited": "False", "id": "iljaso6", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_wvwcq2", "parent_id": "t3_wvwcq2", "score": "13", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "RemoteAnalysis3809", "body": "&#x200B;\n\n>Wrong again.

The first one was about python and general coding knowledge. The later two were 100% leetcode. Each interview is an hour long where they ask 2 easy/medium problems since it was a new grad position. Your best bet at this time is to probably to look up online what topic your company tends to focus on in interviews and review accordingly. Don't forget to review time complexity as well when you study common algorithms. \n\nThe thing about testing positions is that how swe-like the interview is entirely dependent on how much the job they want you to do is swe-like and how much is configuration/ops work. If they want you to build a testing framework, then it is literally a software engineering position. If they want you to implement tests that are already well-defined using a common/stable framework, then they are expecting a bit less swe from you. If they want you to run, monitor and maintain the tests they already have, then even less engineering work you need to do. All of these tasks are under the umbrella of an SDET position though.

Apparently their Republican mind is still stuck in the 80s and they think the only way you can be rich Northerners is by being a dirty commie that takes bribery. \n\nYes my parents are rich as fuck. They belong in the first generation of professional investment bankers in Vietnam. My mother is a VP at a Japanese financial institution that specializes in lending money for foreign east asian investors who would like to set up factories and business in Vietnam. They are literal capitalists in every sense of the word.\n\nEssentially, my parents are business people whose job is assisting international corporations to exploit the cheap labor in Vietnam. Dirty ones at that since I know damn sure how little some of their clients are paying their Vietnamese workers. \n\nAnd yet in the small minds of these old  Republican Vietnamese Americans, somehow that's still better than being a commie.\n\nAnyways lmao I find it hilarious that you mention that pecking order. You do realize why such a thing exists right? It's because the old people coming up with that pecking order can communicate (literally in Vietnamese) and relate the most to the full blooded fully cultural Vietnamese person compare to the American-born zero-cultural-awareness American. \n\nIf you compare your American experience to my Vietnamese experience in this country, I wonder if it would make you feel more secure in your American identity.\n\nI have been denied job opportunities because of my citizenship and visa status. I have taken jobs that pays significantly less than market rates because of my citizenship and visa status. \n\nI have had significant health problems that stem from my body not adjusting well to the climate and fauna in the part of the US I moved to. Problems that are costly as fuck because I didn't realize the importance of having health insurance in the US when I moved here. \n\nI have been made fun of for being an adult in the US who don't know what a social security number is, or why you need a credit card. Needless to say, not knowing what a ssn is also turns you into prime target for conmen. \n\nAll of this happen because I'm a Vietnamese person who grew up in Vietnam and moved to the US as an adult. Probably like your mom and dad. If so, they could probably relate to my struggles better than yours. I wonder how much you can feel that generational, linguistic and cultural barriers between you and them. \n\nLet's contrast my situation to a good friend of mine who has been in the US since she was a kid and lost the ability to speak Vietnamese (I guess it never developed in the first place). She retain good comprehension though. \n\nHer mom would speak to her in Vietnamese, but she would reply back in English. Her mom's English is not that good, so she struggled to understand her daughter's reply. Consequently, their conversation were very \"shallow\" due to this language barrier. \n\nWhat I remember most about my friend's mom is how painful her face looked whenever her daughter replied to her Vietnamese questions/comments in English. And then there's the silence that comes after as she struggle to think of her response in Vietnamese, then translates herself. It's all so long, so complicated, and **I sometimes wonder how much is lost in translation.**\n\nAnyways, I'm in a fucking limbo with the Vietnamese American community. Only older Vietnamese people here can relate to my struggle as an adult immigrant. But then they see me as a Northern commie. \n\nBesides, I'm a 23yo woman. Can't be on board with their Republican, Trump-supporting bs (I'm super proud of myself now for being able to somewhat understand native's conversation regarding American political topics. These things don't come naturally when you're raised in Vietnam at all). \n\nOn the other hand, I can't relate to the young Vietnamese Americans like you. You guys feel offended when other Americans tell you your English is great. When Americans tell me that, I feel fucking flattered dude. I worked so hard to get to C1 and be able to type this wall of text out to you and have it be understood. You know how hard it is to learn by heart all 3 forms of 350 irregular verbs in English? You know how hard it is to spell all these words when you learn them as a second language side by side your Vietnamese native language? English grammar and spelling are FUCKING CRAZY compare to Vietnamese!\n\nAnyways, you get the idea. I'm lonely as fuck here in the Midwest with my white husband. Can't wait to get back home next lunar new year. \n\n\u0110\u00e2m lao ph\u1ea3i theo lao they say. At least I make good money now.

Some of them, inevitably, can be very boastful talking about robotics projects and cool stuff that they did but you didn't do because you're a literal teenage girl and teenage girls aren't exactly known to be techies. \n\nYou get intimidated because you don't have this guy's personality or knowlegde of 5 different programming languages. **If this is what a good programmer looks like, then you probably won't ever be a good programmer.** So you drop the class and that's the end of your SWE dream.\n\n**Solution:** Understand that the field is about problem-solving at its core, not shiny tools. You will catch up with that guy when it comes to tooling at some point (usually your sophomore year), and you will know yourself better than to be afraid of fluff. Be patient with yourself and you will get there.\n\n**Scenario 2:**\n\nYou get to experience some misogyny here and there, because that's just there sometimes. Whether is a professor who pays \"special\" attention to you because you're the girl in class, or lab partners who thinks you're stupid/unmotivated because you don't know 5 programming languages like him, you might feel discouraged from the field.\n\nMy first internship is at a game company where all the devs are part of this softcore porn group chat called \"Sexy pics for breakfast\". Needless to say, the internship was in my home country, where there's less laws about these things. It makes me wonder sometimes though, if it's not so easy to sue a company for discrimination like it is in the US, how many teams will have a group chat like that, considering the prevalence of tech bro culture here?\n\n**Solution:** idk man \n\n**Scenario 3:**\n\nYou got problems with job search because you do [this shit](https://hbr.org/2014/08/why-women-dont-apply-for-jobs-unless-theyre-100-qualified).\n\n**Solution:** \n\n1. If you can say two sentences about a technology, WRITE THAT SHIT DOWN IN YOUR RESUME.  My stupidest mistake when I started searching for jobs is my resume only list technologies I have done extensive work on. Your strat should be the other way around. **Write what you want to know down in your resume. Then fucking learn it.** \n2. Don't even read the job description, just the title, then apply. If you don't even know the rules, you won't be afraid to break/overstep them. \n\ntldr: Most of the problem with women in our field is because of a lacking in confidence in our ability/lacking in the ability to convince others around that we are competent.\n\nThe good thing is most tech-focused companies are aware of this psychological difference and will make sure all their job description contains no fluff and a big focus on problem-solving, which encourage more women to apply for their positions. \n\nThe bad thing is many other companies with less of an emphasis on problem-solving skills and more of an emphasis on tooling might demand 8 years of experience on Flutter, thinking that if most candidates (who tend to be guys) are bluffing already, then the bar needs to be raised to match the bluff.

The vast majority of us are not \"Abrahamically religious\", so our cultural traditions have never specified that gayness is immoral or wrong because of that.\n\nThe problem is our family culture does place high importance on having biological kids and \"fitting in\".

On a family level, I'll say coming out to your parents is like telling them you hate them, since filial piety dictates that the best way to express love to your parents is having children yourself. People don't say \"I love you\" to our parents since words of love are considered fake and holds little value in the culture. We are to make children (and other actionable items) to show that love. So saying that you're gay is often taken by parents as you saying that you don't love them.

One guy in 60 people graduating my year with a CS degree. Dude grew up in the South side of Chicago.

If your cousin/uncle is a permanent resident only, it's 20+ years if you start now.\n\nGood luck.

The owner who's an older Vietnamese-American man realized I'm from modern Vietnam through my accent and decided I'm a \"commie\" who needs a \"lecture\".  As someone who was a Vietnamese international student, sentiments like what you displayed are exactly why I have trouble hanging around most Asian Americans in general and Vietnamese Americans specifically. \n\nI think you're assuming so much without actually asking these international students about themselves and why they are in your school and where their parents' wealth came from. I can guarantee you that hearing them talk about what their parents do might surprises you.\n\nMy parents are finance-industry professionals woking for Japanese banks in Vietnam. Their wealth only exist because Vietnam (like China) decided to open our economy and became factories to the world. They are bankers, aka the literal definition of capitalism, not bureaucrats in the government making money off of taxpayers. But so many Vietnamese Americans I met simply assume my parents' wealth came from being dirty politicians for the Vietnamese Communist Party. My parents are probably dirty as fuck, but they are dirty capitalists, not communists. My dad hated that he has to pay so much taxes and my mom hated that she has to bribe officials. They both hate the Vietnamese government with a passion. \n\nThe creepy part is somehow that they are dirty bankers instead of dirty bureaucrats makes it better to some people?\n\nAnyways, the reality is the vast majority of the development that my country was able to do only started when we opened our economy, not when it was a centralized economy run by the government. Same with China. Therefore, working in private entities are how the vast majority of people acquire their wealth and send their kids to the US for studying. Yes there are sons and daughters of bureaucrats studying in the US, but they are definitely a minority of the international students by this point in time.  \n\nI think the problem is most Vietnamese-Americans left Vietnam when it was a poor war-torn country run by the VCP with a shitty economy run by the gov and zero ways to work for private entities. Combining that with the trauma that goes with being an immigrant/refugee and you're gonna see people hate not just the Vietnamese government, but also the people who chose to stay back. And then the hatred gets passed to the next generation of Asian-Americans, and you have people going around with these assumptions about the modern economies and the people of a country many second-gen AAPI haven't even been to.  \n\nMeanwhile, I grew up in Vietnam when it was the fastest-growing economy in the entire Asia Pacific. We are still very much a developing country with developing-country-problems like pollution, corruption, low standard of living, etc. However, I can guarantee you that the poorest Vietnamese person eats much more nutritious food than the poorest Americans, the worst public schools in Vietnam give much better STEM education than the average public school in the US, and the cost of going to a family/primary care doctor in Vietnam is actually much more affordable to the average person, despite specialized medicine being very lackluster. \n\nI personally benefited so much from the public education system in Vietnam. The level of Math and Science that I went through was unimaginable for most kids here. It prepared me so well for my CS degree in the US. Meanwhile, my parents wealth made it possible for me to learn English at night at a young age, something that public schools in VN couldn't give me. \n\nNow that I'm a software engineer in the US, making more money than most people at my age, I look back at my upbringing with pride, which makes my attitude the opposite of many of the older Vietnamese-American first gen here who came as refugees. \n\nVietnam to them is trauma, while Vietnam to me is my home. The US to Asian-Americans is their home, while the US to me is my workplace where I build my career.\n\nI guess what I'm saying is I understand the prejudice of the previous generations, but I'm just so fucking tired of being scapegoated for things that happened decades before I was even born.", "created_utc": "1648077226.0", "edited": "False", "id": "i1v1b8w", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_tkyrms", "parent_id": "t1_i1ufm5e", "score": "5", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i"}, {"author": "RemoteAnalysis3809", "body": "/uj Exactly.

The weird part is, most of these \"Chinese-borrowed\" words are actually coined by Japanese scholars. \n\nSo you have this super interesting phenomenon where 150-200 years ago, Japanese students were sent to Europe to study the sciences and economics.

So when they came back to Vietnam and started opening their own schools, they started translating Japanese textbooks into Vietnamese using these Japanese terms coined using Chinese components. That's why early Vietnamese terminologies of these fields are so heavily influenced by Japanese Kanji. \n\nSo now in Vietnamese we have 50% of our words being called t\u1eeb H\u00e1n Vi\u1ec7t aka Han words.

Additionally, the use of \"high\" or \"low\" pronouns can be ironic, such as when you call your best friend \"it\" because it's endearing. Therefore, it's actually pretty hard for new learners to fully fathom how they are perceived by native speakers, as well as what pronoun to use when speaking with different social groups at the start of their studying. \n\nI'm a native speaker of Vietnamese and I find the most glaring difference between native speakers, heritage speakers and new learners of the language is our use of pronouns. \n\nHeritage speakers can use familial pronouns naturally, but since they only speak Vietnamese at home with parents and not necessarily in other social  and professional contexts, many are not comfortable with \"non-familial\" pronouns. \n\nNew learners will just straight suck at it, doing things like calling a grandma \"young sister\", or refer to themselves as \"it\". My boyfriend is American, I taught him some Vietnamese. He used the pronoun for young women and girls when he first met  my mom. She found it hilarious.

The problem is the vast majority of people on earth don't think of race the way most Americans do. Let me show you an example:\n\nI grew up in Vietnam (pretty racially homogenous) and moved to the US to study a few years ago as an adult. As a result, I grew up with zero concept of race as a social construct. What that means is, if you ask me, or any Vietnamese person in Vietnam if they know what a black person looks like, yes we can describe the skin color of a black person. But if you show me a picture of a black person and the picture of a watermelon, I will not be able to mentally connect the two images together the way someone who's born and raised in the US can.\n\nIt actually took me years of living in the US before I fully realized that when an American person sees me for the first time, they first see an Asian-American, with all the biases that goes with what is conventionally associated with this racial group in the US. Before that realization, I just thought oh this kid was asking me to try for her sorority because she's nice (without realizing it's a sorority for Asian-American girls), or those shitty lab partners just don't do their part of the group assignment because they are shitty lab partners, etc.\n\nMy LAC was in the Midwest with a majority white population. It offered me a great financial aid package and that was the reason I came in the first place. I did not understand the logic of why they gave me all that money to enroll until years down the road.\n\nEventually, too many instances like that made me question my own sanity. Obviously, there was no race-based sororities and fraternities in Vietnam, there was no one banking on me to do their CS project for them either.\n\nIt was only after I got closer to this friend of mine who's born and raised in the South side of Chicago and received the same scholarship as I did to attend my institution that I started to grasp the depth of what race means to the Americans around me.\n\nBut anyways, my point is, a big part of \"culture shock\" for me moving to the US is learning about race, in the American sense of that term. Of course everyone knows that racism is wrong, but the manifestation of American-style racism is not something global. It's not something you're inherently born with. It's something you have to learn as you integrate into American society. And it's so subtle that it took me years to start seeing it. And I can guarantee you that I will never be able to see it fully the way actual Americans born and raised in the US can.\n\nSo next time you talk to someone who's born and raised in a homogenous society, I hope you can understand that we simply don't think of race as frequently as you guys. We don't encounter racial problems as often as you guys do. Our \"racial\" awareness simply do not get developed the way people from more racially diverse society do.\n\nAs for \"Japanese and Korean police aren't baselessly killing ethnic minorities\", if your country is so racially homogenous you don't have ethnic minorities in the first place, of course the police aren't killing them. If your country is super strict with immigration in the first place, of course the police aren't deporting people. Like I said, being in an ethnically homogenous society, you simply do not encounter these problems as much.\n\n**It's literally a different reality.** \n\nAnd I have to travel in between those realities all the time as someone who's a racial and ethnic minority where I live now, and more importantly, someone who's in a serious interracial intercultural relationship.", "created_utc": "1642565000.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ht9wff5", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_s72f3t", "parent_id": "t1_ht9evvw", "score": "10", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i"}, {"author": "RemoteAnalysis3809", "body": "Then you should see half the shit Japanese and Korean media have made that features Black people.

But evidence of ethnic cleansing is a totally different thing. I 100% believe there is a separatist movement going on in Xinjiang that the CCP is threatened by. I 100% believe the leaders of such a movement had to seek refuge in Turkey and Pakistan. I have seen plenty of documents and first-hand accounts from them talking about their experience in the facilities. I wholeheartedly believe Uyghur people are discriminated against in China by the Han ethnic majority. \n\nThe problem is claiming that torture and ethnic cleansing is the reality for all the dozens of millions of people in Xinjiang instead of a small political group.\n\nThe Uyghur population in Xinjiang has been increasing, albeit at a much slower rate since contraception was made available in the region, giving people there the power to control when and how they get pregnant. Birth control is not haram in Islam btw. \n\nAs people gain a higher standard of living, every single community goes through this process where access to medical facilities and food becomes common enough that child mortality is significantly lowered, while women are still bearing 8 kids, leading to a significant increase in population. After that, children and especially girl's education access becomes a norm, which means there are more incentives to limit the number of kids you have and invest more in each of them. Combining that with access to birth control, and a declining rate of birth is very much expected. It happened in Europe and the US in the 60s, it happened in my developing country during the 80s and 90s. \n\nMy own maternal grandmother gave birth to 5 kids in the 80s. Then immediately after our government made IUD available for free, she got one and never looked back. Had my grandmother kept having more children, I can assure you that my mom and her sisters would not have been able to get the education that they got. \n\nI also want to point out that using an IUD has a much higher risk of causing infertility afterward than other kinds of contraception, and I have read sources claiming that the widespread use of IUDs could be a \"mechanism\" by the CCP to ultimately make Uyghur women infertile. The problem with this logic is that it fails to take into account the demographics of women using IUD and how this demographic is not young or rich. For young, rich women who can afford a refill of pills every month and plan to have kids at some point in time later in life, daily pills are the perfect option. But for older women who has had enough kids in her life but can still get pregnant, doesn't have access to hysterectomy, wants a cheap method that works up to 10 years with little intervention after the initial insert, the IUD is the better option. Do you think women from a developing region is more likely to be young female professionals wanting to focus on their careers, or moms in their 30s and 40s who have had enough kids for their whole life?\n\nSo with all that in mind, why assume there's something more to declining birth rates in Xinjiang specifically when that has been the trend in every other place in the world as people become more developed in a society? \n\nAs for the actual prisons in Xinjiang, like I said, I wholeheartedly believe Uyghur people are discriminated against in China. I would not be surprised is the incarceration rate of Uyghur men is higher than that of Han Chinese men. The problem is this:\n\nTwo years ago, within the context of an outreach program in my university, I was able to take a class with inmates inside a prison in Ohio for a semester. It was a super interesting class. Even more interesting of classmates. They are inmates.\n\nAnd most of them are black. \n\nIf I were to take a picture of that prison I went to for class, post it on the most common social network in Vietnam with a caption in Vietnamese saying \"Black Americans are getting genocided, the women are being forcibly sterilized through abortion availability, the men are thrown into big facilities for no reason\". I bet there will be people who believe that. people who can't read English and has no idea what's going on in the US specifically. \n\nBut all Americans know race relations in the US is incredibly complicated and despite widespread discrimination, no one seriously thinks black people in the US are being genocided. But not everyone in the world is American. Not everyone knows all the context. I didn't. Disney Channel doesn't talk about racism in Totally Spies. \n\nSo imagine if there's a question posted on Voz (Vietnamese equivalent of Reddit/4chan), asking what the world should do to the US for genociding black people, how will you as an American react? Are you gonna be able to type out 3000 words to explain the context of race relations in the US to all these foreigners who don't know much about American history? Imagine if people in the comment section are all calling for a boycott of Americans by not selling any products to the US anymore.

When I'm in downtown Seattle at night after a flight or have a late bus in NYC, there is always that feeling of \"there's some drugged homeless people around who's probably willing to do some violent shit to get their next hit\". And that's where the fear comes from. \n\nMeanwhile, drug on the street is extremely uncommon in the urban areas in Hanoi, as well as homelessness, so you simply don't develope that fear as a child.

I speak English fluently despite being born and raised in Vietnam and went to public schools my entire life. The reason why I became so motivated to learn English at a young age is because of Disney Channel and Cartoon network. Vietnam in the 1990s and 2000s didn't have an entertainment industry and those American channels was my favorite thing because everything is so interesting. I remember enjoying Totally Spies and The Powerpuff Girls, etc. despite not understanding a single word of English.\n\nAnd there lies the problem. I became interested in the US and I learned English because of **American media.** \n\nLater on, my decision to move to the US and attend college here is also because of mainstream American media. Because Americans look so happy on screen, so rich with their big house and nice backyard, so full of energy. Everything is so cool. \n\nBut then when I actually spent 4 years of my life in the US, well, obviously Hollywood didn't prepare you well for reality.\n\nThe first time I have ever seen a homeless person is in the US. Mind you, I grew up in the most populous city in Vietnam, and we do not have a homeless problem.\n\nThe first time I have ever felt unsafe as a woman at night is in an American city. Mind you, I was traveling alone on buses in my city as a 14yo girl frequently at night for extra English classes. My parents suggested it because public transport is for everyone where I'm from, not just poor criminals like it is in American cities.\n\nOf course the US has its own greatness. I made more money in this country now than I could ever imagine as a child in Vietnam. The Americans I have made friends with are awesome and the education I got here is incredibly personalized and I love that. \n\nBut here's the funny thing. Everything that I find awesome about the US when I'm actually here is not something that I had expected growing up in Vietnam watching American news and shows. \n\nAnd all the things that I expected would be cool about the US turned into something I hate. \n\nFor example, Freedom! That sounds great right? But then I'm here and my university got school shooting drill, and my boyfriend was worried when some fireworks were going off a few days ago before the new year, thinking it might be gunshots in the neighborhood. \n\nThat's when I realized that the individual freedom that Americans enjoy means people are also free to destroy themselves and other people with fewer consequences. It also means people are encouraged to be entitled, to be selfish, to be inconsiderate to others in society because, well, freedom. \n\nNot that there's nothing fun and awesome about being free, it just also means you gotta expect more violence around you compared to growing up in a less free, but more harmonious society, as people have much bigger egos here than they do at home. \n\nSo anyways, what I'm saying is, more than anyone, I know what it is like to find things in a foreign country different in reality from what you see on the media. I know what it is like to have a reality check when I choose to move across the Earth because I have an American fantasy that is created from watching Disney Channel and browsing Youtube.\n\nMy question for you is, after Vietnam, Iraq, Afghanistan, when will you guys finally realize that the American superhero fantasy is just that? fantasy.", "created_utc": "1641525481.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hrl5ekm", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_rxqhy1", "parent_id": "t1_hrkyvub", "score": "11", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i"}, {"author": "RemoteAnalysis3809", "body": "Feel free to look through my account if you any doubt anything I said is fake.

For example, rice and pretty much most of Agriculture. Food is cheaper than most things in life because there is a low barrier of entry within the industry and all the products generally are replaceable by different competitors. That's why farmers tend to make little without intervention by the government through subsidies and taxing imported goods.\n\nOn the other hand you have stuff like chip production, where yes the final product tend to be \"somewhat\" similar in function across different suppliers, but the barrier of entry to become a supplier in the first place is extremely high. That's why consumers have little choice over the price of these things. \n\nAnd then you have things like oil, where supply is finite and the barrier of entry is super high, which is why OPEC is a thing. If you don't know what that is, it's an oligarchy consisting of most suppliers from this few oil producing countries in the whole world that dictates the price of crude oil on a global scale. The actual consumers cannot simply just lower the price of oil by going to a different supplier because all suppliers participate in this pact of circlejerking that results in more profit for them overall. \n\nAnd then finally you got things like clothes and games. Barrier of entry is not that high, but the products created by different suppliers are very different from each other. That's why there's such a different range in price where a Target shirt is 30usd while a Gucci shirt is 3000usd.

They download the game and 80% of them leaves within a day. But there will be this 1% that don't leave and become a whale. \n\nYour whale is somewhat random in most hypercasuals. Could be an American woman in her 30s. Could be this dude in his 20s. Could be the old Asian lady in her 60s. I have seen a hypercasual game that makes money from these 10 whales that spent literally hundreds of thousands of dollars per year. All those whales live somewhere in the Middle East and that's all we knew about them. The point I'm getting at is hypercasuals is somewhat a marketing game. You get more people to look at your game, it's more likely that one of them becomes a whale. So you need ads everywhere to keep your game going. Because you know the quality of the gameplay will be somewhat shit and you need to churn through people. And when you run out of people to churn through, you make a new game with the exact same gameplay but different visuals and repeat the whole process again.\n\nOn the other hand of this is hard-core games with high \"hook\". In these games, the goal is to keep the current playerbase happy. People come and generally stays for a long long time by industry standard. Your goal is not just to get them to pay, it's to keep them paying, through continuous release of content. League falls into this side of the spectrum for obvious reasons. The downside of having a loyal playerbase if you gotta do some fucked up shit for them to leave. If it's just minor inconvenience, most of the playerbase are addicted enough to keep coming back. \n\nAnyways, long rant but my point is, the  power of choice by consumers is limited by factors such as distinctiveness of the goods, and barrier of entry for suppliers. It's not so simple as \"competition drives bad suppliers out\", because competition is not always available. Within the gaming industry in general and lol specifically, we are the equivalent of Apple customers, which means we are willing to pay more because we are loyal/addicted, even if the product has been the exact same shit for years.", "created_utc": "1641395807.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hrd1ulb", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_rwdz2y", "parent_id": "t1_hrcv3p8", "score": "5", "subreddit": "leagueoflegends", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rfxx"}, {"author": "RemoteAnalysis3809", "body": "Watch anything released by Julian Assage and Edward Snowden regarding the treatment of locals in Syria and Afghanistan by the US military and I think you might find your assumption that the US does not terrify innocent civilians a bit inaccurate to say the least.", "created_utc": "1641327110.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hr98niz", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_rvoqym", "parent_id": "t1_hr8q8fu", "score": "6", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i"}, {"author": "RemoteAnalysis3809", "body": "The description reminds me of an African man I know.

Are they gonna turn to rebel against their government, or are they going to develop a special hatred towards the US government for implementing a policy that guarantees no local business can survive the economic downturn that will happen if all big companies decide to pull away from the region. It's always easier to hate the people living on the other side of Earth for taking your jobs away, and I'm sure Americans are more aware of this than anyone.", "created_utc": "1639881785.0", "edited": "1639939529.0", "id": "hp4f8ab", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_rjc266", "parent_id": "t1_hp3a1zg", "score": "25", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i"}, {"author": "RemoteAnalysis3809", "body": "The reason why I have to explain why and how everyone got into their major is precisely because it's not \"we all got into our school and pick our major\", it's \"we want to study with the best kids at this specific subject in the city so we took exams and a few of us got in\".

Each major has a hard cap at 40 or 80 students per major depending on the major (example: Math's cap is 80 while Chinese cap is 40). \n\nAdmission is decided by three entrance exams, one for Math, one for Literature, and one for the target subject of specialization (English, Physics, Biology, etc.) The target subject score is weighed stronger than the other two subjects to guarantee that only the best candidates of said subject got in. \n\nThe English test that I took was like the IELTS. There were speaking, listening, essay writing and reading sections. Admission rate into the English program is at 5% generally.\n\nI got in to that program, and of the 80 students who was at the top of the ladder in the English language exam, only 9 are guys. \n\nAnd that's not just my year, it's every year since the English concentration was added in the 1980s that the number of guys who got in is less than 15% of the whole English sub-class. And it was not just English, Chinese and Russian also have always had at least 80% of their classes being female students.\n\nHere's an even crazier thing, I got friends from schools similar to mine in other districts and even other cities in my country. We were all in specialized public schools with different subject concentrations, some of which are languages. The only way to get in is to take proficiency tests in your tl. And ALL of their schools language programs have a lot more female students than male ones. Whether the language is Japanese, Korean, German or English, there seems to be much more female students at that highest level for high-school students.\n\nGoing to that high school made me think a lot about the relationship among sex, gender and academic subjects. Bear in mind that my high school offers specialization in Math, Literature, Biology, Physics, etc. apart from languages. So I also get to see this sex imbalance, or the lacking of it, in other sub-classes as well. The math, chemistry and biology sub-classes got a surprisingly fine balance at around 40% students identifying as female for each class my year. Physics and History got A LOT more dudes. And then there's Literature and the Foreign Languages, all of which has way more girls than guys. \n\nNote that what I'm saying here isn't that dudes can't or don't want to learn languages. I'm saying that assuming there is an equal number of males and females who learn languages, and assuming that everyone works their asses off to learn those languages, girls tend to be the top performers when there's an attempt to score everyone's language capabilities. \n\nI'm not sure why this is the case, but as someone who's been learning languages my entire life and has been part of so many different language learning communities, I cannot help but notice the sex imbalance at the top level when it comes to language proficiency for non-native learners.", "created_utc": "1639814656.0", "edited": "1639815404.0", "id": "hp0z2t2", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_riqkr5", "parent_id": "t1_hp0vj05", "score": "-1", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "RemoteAnalysis3809", "body": "I learn my English because of pure utility, my Japanese because of more utility than passion, my Mandarin because of more passion than utility and my Arabic out of pure passion. \n\nI say at this point as a language learner, the act of studying itself is what I enjoy as a hobby, like someone who bakes because she mainly enjoys mixing powders, not just because she likes eating cookies.

I felt closer on a cultural level to them more than any other groups on campus, whether it's other international student groups or domestic American students, or even second gen Vietnamese-Americans.

Meanwhile, Kdrama and Anime are quite some big chunks of my childhood. Same for most other kids in Vietnam specifically and SEA in general. Half the girls in my Vietnamese primary school 15 years ago were 8yo Kpop stans and that's completely normal. The boys were all reading Naruto/Onepiece and argue about Kamen Rider action figures. It's very normalized to enjoy that style of pop culture.\n\nMeanwhile, when I came to the US as an adult a few years ago for college, it's very different. Kdrama only recently got its big break into the minds of the American public through Parasite (and now Squid Game) and Kpop is still quite \"fringe\". So I'm not surprised that people (even in the language learning communities) here would look down on Kpop stans and weebs.\n\nThe other thing I notice is most people (who aren't legacy speakers) learning Chinese, Korean and Japanese in the US don't learn these languages for \"practical purposes\" like getting a job in translation/interpretation work, or work for a Chinese/Japanese company. So people are more likely to feel prideful/boastful about their learning journey since language learning is intimate/personal to them.\n\nOn the other hand, a good chunk of Vietnamese people I know learn Japanese to immigrate to Japan. My dad learned Japanese years ago because he works for a Japanese company (Japan is the biggest foreign investor in my country). My friends learn Korean because half of Samsung's factories are based in Vietnam and there are good jobs there if you know Korean. My Chinese tutor's day job is to be an interpreter for a Chinese import/export company in Vietnam. These people view the languages they learn as a tool for career advancement rather than personal fulfillment. When I learned English to be a better programmer/student, I feel the same way.\n\nBecause these people learn EA languages for non-personal reasons, I think they are less likely to feel \"egoistical\" about their accomplishment in the language. If it's all for the sake of talking with native speakers and doing businesses, people don't try to one-up another on being good at the language itself, but rather treat it as a tool like any other professional skillsets.\n\nSo in a way, I think the bad attitude you mentioned comes from a place of genuine care for the language.

I can't protest here just like you can't protest in China. I can't change my employer freely, nor can I apply for positions in the government. USCIS knows exactly where I live, how much I make, my thumbprints, etc. They know all my social media as well as who my parents are and where they live in Vietnam too. You should take a look at the forms that aliens have to file to acquire even just a student visa in the US. You're gonna see how much of a privilege you have as an American with few barriers to travel internationally due to the strength of your passport. Bare in mind that even the whitest trash pedophile ever existed in Alabama is also granted the same privilege as you do in that regard just because he's also American.\n\nAnd I'm totally fine with all that.

The many investors who invest in our local populations and build businesses in Vietnam. They could be Chinese Japanese American or Taiwanese, and they have been and always will be welcomed. I think we both know more than anyone how businesspeople, engineers and professionals of different races and ethnicities are welcomed everywhere including China, while people with little skills to offer but their \"perfect English\" will slowly become a thing of the past.\n\nAgain, China doesn't ban foreigners to come. China decides it no longer wants foreigners with no other skillsets other than good English to stay in their country.\n\nIf one day the US changes their curriculum so that kids learn to actually do math and they no longer feel the need to import engineers, I will happily leave this country. Because I don't expect locals to cater to me when I'm in their country, unlike you.\n\nThe fact that you think you're being discriminated against because you're a white American dude while talking bout the social and economic dynamics of being a white guy in Asia is just the most funny thing ever. You earn more than the average locals. You get more pussy than the average locals. You get a lot more freedom than the average locals considering you aren't culturally and financially tied to your family and the government the way most people there do (I assume). And you cry discrimination? Bias and stereotyping, sure, but actual racial discrimination? Have you ever gotten racial insults thrown at you in public because of the color of your skin, or because you speak your native language in public? Because I have.\n\nAlso I'm a woman if you ever think I'm jealous with your white dick. I have my own problem with fetishization to deal with as an Asian woman in the US. And unlike most dudes of any ethnicity, I'm not interested in getting as many dicks as possible, so the fetishization is a lot more creepy than cool.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>I think it is hypocritical that you hate white people in Asia but you would consider a white American who hated Asians as racist.\n\nDo you consider yourself a racist/xenophobe? Consider you have quite a negative bias against Chinese people from your post. And you call me a hypocrite? Like I said, i don't hate white people in Asia, I hate ungrateful white people in Asia who take advantage of locals' ignorance of what a native English speaker looks like and then go on Reddit to talk shit about the host country that allows them to do something other than flipping burgers in McDonald's.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>You can afford to care less about the xenophobia in the US because it does not impact your ability to live there. If the xenophobia was built in the law and prevented you from owning a home, settling, marrying, etc., you would feel differently.\n\nYou think my work visa in the US just fall from the sky? You think I can jut buy a plane ticket to China and start working the way you did? If I don't have the education and skillsets that I do, I would be an illegal alien in the US, or someone on a tourist/student visa. As an illegal alien, I would have the exact same problem as you described. I could try working under the table and get raided by the ICE then deported, like any other immigrant. And yes all of that is built into US law.\n\nDon't think systemic xenophobia is exclusive to China. Read your own country's current immigration policies. You can clearly see what ethnic groups they are targeting with each type of visa granted. It's so detailed and systemic that you have to admire the dedication that goes into crafting it while still maintaining a neutral vocab for all the official documentations.\n\nAs for my personal situation, there are only 60,000 H1B visas granted for foreigners who want to work in the US every year. Last year there were 300,000 applicants. And you have to have an employer who is willing to sponsor you (aka spend thousands of dollars to process your immigration record). It's a matter of luck too whether you get your visa or not. Next year I will have to leave the US if I belong to the 240,000 people who were unlucky. That's just the way it is and I can't blame my host country for kicking me out if they no longer need me.\n\n**I'm telling you all this because I feel like you're so caught up with your situation in China that you don't realize most of your problems aren't Chinese-specific, but immigrant/expat-specific.** If you go to any subreddit or first-gen immigrant communities that speak English, I'm sure you will find a lot of similar sentiment whether you're an Algerian immigrant in France, a Malay immigrant in New Zealand or a South African immigrant in China.\n\nTo be honest with you, I feel a lot for you from reading your post. But I think your problem isn't China, your problem is that you're a foreigner in a foreign land. And I really do feel you in that aspect as a foreigner in a foreign land as well.I felt super great in the US within the first 4 months but then spent 3 years in depression due to cultural shock. It's just the way it is. I was able to stick through with it because I make good money here. And if you can't do that, leave. But also knows the problem isn't your host country, or yourself for all that matter, the problem is you fail to integrate, whether financially or culturally. And that's fine, especially when you're home country is developed and even flipping burgers in McDonald's pay more than owning a small business in Asia.", "created_utc": "1633464137.0", "edited": "1633464641.0", "id": "hfiprh8", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_q1llz5", "parent_id": "t1_hfi6ctj", "score": "1", "subreddit": "ChineseLanguage", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qyz1"}, {"author": "RemoteAnalysis3809", "body": "What do you mean arbitrary detention of foreigners?", "created_utc": "1633453202.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hfhznva", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_q1llz5", "parent_id": "t1_hfh70qu", "score": "1", "subreddit": "ChineseLanguage", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qyz1"}, {"author": "RemoteAnalysis3809", "body": "This post reeks of (white American) entitlement.

I speak English fluently even before moving to the US. And yet it still took me years before I could adjust on a mental level to the culture here.

It's because they gave their all to us as well (obviously generally speaking here).\n\nParents are expected to give their all, and children are also expected the same thing. That's the core of family interdependence. \n\nObviously no one wants to be abuse, and every human being wants to stay away from abuse. The complicated part is that in American culture, the abuse is seemingly all it takes for people to give up on their family members and disregard everything they ever helped you with.\n\nWhereas at least with my case, my mom beat me up regularly when I was a child and forbid me from doing many things with the intention to discipline me, but I never hated her for it because again, she gave me everything she has. \n\nIt's like if someone beat you up but also created you, give you all their money and actually cooks and cares for you from the moment you're born until when you're an adult. A few beatings here and there doesn't make me want to not ever see her again.

Made the decision to join the military despite his parents wanting him to try college. Now he's in his 30s managing a kitchen at a restaurant and regretted his entire 20s. \n\nI don't want that for myself and I don't want that for my kids. He agrees.\n\nAnd that's why the family-loyalty models work: your parents can be assholes, but as long as they are giving it their all towards your future, you will still be loyal to them. You may not like your parents, but you love them. And vice versa from the parents too. And that's the essence of why this works and why people all around the world does it. \n\nThe key is you can be assholes to your kids/parents, but you cannot be negligent/absent. \n\nSo I think the reason why in the US the family loyalty model doesn't work is because abusive parents here are probably more of the  negligent type instead of the asshole ones.

So the point stands.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>**you** don't have much of a choice to spend the ridiculous amount if you want a diploma\n\nMy parents paid for my American degree out of pocket. In fact, they bet their entire life savings on it. As international students in the US, we cannot legally get loans since we can easily default by leaving the US, so the vast majority of international students in the US pay out-of-pocket tuition.\n\nAnd yet it's very common for people to spend their whole life saving on their children's education where I'm from. If your family is simply farmers in a remote area with no money, you still invest your life savings to pay for local college tuition for your kids. Some of them even borrow money to send their kids abroad for work. If you're well off in a big city like my family, it's common to pull the entire savings on your oldest child's education abroad in places like Australia, Canada or the US.\n\nThere are millions of students from Asia to Africa who are students like me in the US right now. We carry the investments of our parents in our education. Our parents know it's expensive, they have zero (not even federal loans) support from any government. In my personal case, 1 USD = 23000vnd so the tuition cost is even more fucked up. And yet they do it anyway.\n\nSo no, I don't spend a ridiculous amount on my American tuition.

I don't feel like I'm faking myself in front of them, since how I treat them, how I act in front of them and my feeling towards them is real. It's simply that there are other aspects of myself that they don't know of and that's completely fine.\n\nObviously this is opening a whole can of worms about cultural differences regarding which things do you often not tell your parents to maintain \"harmony\" within the family, such as coming out, cheating, etc. For example, I know so many people who are openly gay/lesbian elsewhere but refuse to come out to their family officially, despite their family obviously understand that they aren't straight after sharing the same household for their entire life. Regarding cheating, it's very common for people to be ok with their partner cheating as long as they don't have to hear about it. Which means even when wives discover their husband is cheating on them, they just keep it low unless there's an actual problem like an out-of-wedlock child that's taking away resource from her children.  [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEosfpqDaKc) about cheating is in Japan, but I feel that the sentiment rings true in other places as well.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>I always wanted to experience a tight knit family, but without the cultural pressure of family importance I wonder if other parts of the world will develop similarly.\n\nI think the culture pressure isn't just simply \"family important blah bloh\" but the idea is all about **interdependence**, and that's why it sticks so deep. Because people it's not ideological/cultural/noble to prioritize family, but practical.\n\nYoung adults stay with their parents when they are young, dumb and poor, so that later on when the parents become old, senile and can't work anymore, they can live with their children and have someone take care of them.\n\nMy own parents paid 100k for me to go to the US and study as an investment into my future (international students cannot take out private/public loans in the US, so every cent for us is out of pocket). I know that's their retirement funds and I have the responsibility to pay it back for them even when they don't tell me to.\n\nWhen you're a child growing up in this environment and you see your parents going all out for your future, you tend to feel **indebted** to them. So it's not a \"cultural authority\" of some sort that tells you to respect your parents, love them and take care of them, but you just have to because they have already done so much for you. And you're gonna do the same to your own children, because you're aware how much it helped you when you were just a teenagers.\n\nSo anyways, I think that's the reality about Asian family expectations: it stem from thinking of children as investments.

Where I'm from, it's completely normal for people to live with their parents until their marriage. The idea is you have a gradual transfer of responsibility within a household, where parents offer guidance on how to \"adult responsibly\" as the kids go to college/work in jobs at the start of their adulthood. Meanwhile, since the kids are actively paying bills/contribute in other ways to the household, they have a chance to actually see how their parents handle adult life.\n\nEssentially young adults won't be left high and dry on their own the moment they turn 18. So it's much less likely that they will spend their young adult years on drug use or acquiring consumer debt.\n\nWhen I was an economics major, I used to wonder how credit card and student debt is such an American phenomenon.

I was born and raised in Vietnam. And so many empires have told people in my country throughout our history that all they wanted to do was trying to \"help\". And then they proceed to help us by bombing our country to the ashes because they \"perceive\" that as helping. The people in those countries felt the responsibility to act when they perceive suffering. And I'm not saying that the intention is not noble, but it's so **arrogant** to think you as someone born and raised on the other side of Earth know enough bout the culture, history the social context that created the current situations more than the locals themselves, so much so that you think you of all people have the solution to their problems.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"Still, I do think humanity would be better off if our system was adapted in more places, especially places that are lacking individuality like China or nuance like the US' political system does.\"\n\nBut that's the problem though. You're assuming that China wants individuality, or the US wants nuance, when in my **general** experience, Chinese people are proud of their collectivism, while Americans are proud of their extremity. I don't think the majority of people in both these places want to change to your country's political system, simply because if they want to, they would have to give up those attributes that they are proud of. As someone who is born and raised in Vietnam, which is a country with heavy Chinese influence in our culture, and currently works and studies in the US, I have lived with and worked with many Chinese and American people in my life. I speak both English and Mandarin. Believe me when I say the 400 million Americans aren't stupid, and the 1 billions of Chinese people in China aren't either. The majority of them are simply prioritizing different cultural values compare to, say, people from Switzerland. And if that means less democracy, then so be it.\n\nI don't think the question is whether people should have democracy or not, but what we are willing to give for the potential of (not even a guaranteed) democracy. As someone whose family members have suffered greatly due to political turmoil, like most other Vietnamese people, I don't think democracy is worth it for us. We are currently one of the fastest developing economies in the world. If political instability becomes a reality, we won't just take a few days off, go protest a bit and have some fun doing the protesting. We could die. Our economies would tank. There would be no public schools nor public healthcare. And I'm sure many Chinese people feel the same about the potential of not having a government. Many of us looked at the Arab Spring and Syria and asked ourselves if that would be us someday if we choose revolution. And the people collectively said no by far, by not doing anything.\n\nYou could spread awareness all you want but you can only spread it to non-Chinese people on Reddit. Obviously, by your own standard of democracy, foreigners on Reddit can't vote, nor should try to impose their laws and cultures on the people in China. So non-Chinese, including you, should not be able to change anything in China by your standard of democracy, no matter how much you talk about it. So if you still want to impose your system on another country, you could only do it the American way, which obviously isn't the most democratic way to do it. And that, I think, is the biggest dilemma of foreign intervention: it is, by definition, undemocratic. \n\n\bFurthermore and as a Vietnamese person, I'm really glad that China isn't democratic. If it had been, I'm pretty sure the majority of Chinese people would vote to attack the South China Sea, Taiwan, and we would have World War 3 by that point.\n\nThe US got the most freedom of speech I have ever experienced. Doesn't make the people there less brainwashed by their own brand of fake news and conspiracy theories. You can say more freedom of speech, more truth, but I notice there are also more lies, more scams, more slurs that goes unchecked. At least China bans anti-vax content on their internet. On the other hand, the US chooses to prioritize their freedom of speech above all else even if that means accepting misinformation, promoting of ideology-based violence or just good-old racism/xenophobia, and I can respect that dedication to their values. \n\nSorry I started rambling there. But I think all countries are the way they are because that's what they want to be, right up until the moment everything changes. As a foreigner to both China and the US but have my personal life intertwined heavily with both, all I can do is sit back and watch everything unfolds.\n\nPS: I wish my country could take a bit of that neutrality from yours.

Meanwhile for students coming from India or Europe, it's much easier for them to understand English because of the shared linguistics. East and South East asian languages, as well as African ones are simply vastly different languages that aren't in the Indo-European linguistic category. The fact that there are people who are born and raised in East Asia yet can speak fluent English at all is a miracle already and they should have dedicated videos about them on YouTube the way people marvel at those \"white guy speak fluent Japanese\" videos.\n\nIt is racist however, to say we don't have critical thinking instead of understanding that most of us don't share your priorities as international students instead of domestic ones.\n\nYou know what people can do with 6.5 IELTS (baseline for US institutions)? Have you ever learned a foreign language in your life to that upper intermediate level? Then you will know exactly what it is like to know what \"existentialism\" means while having no clue what \"Netflix and chill\" means. Academic English is NOT conversational English and most international students know much more academic English than social English precisely because those exams we pass for college in the US test academic English first and foremost. That's why we can all reasonably manage studying in the US but not necessarily socializing with Americans. \n\nTry and explain Politics, American football, White Culture, Black Culture to people who don't even know what a Budlight is. Of course it's gonna take years. It took me years to fully get there. \n\nOf course we international students are capable of making meaningful communication. I myself was the prime example of someone who did a lot to integrate. I did my fair share of partying and smoking, occasionally doing shrooms with some local hippies. Bonfires are always nice for the occasion. I'm a big nerd who's into board games so DnD campaigns with some of the local nerds were my favorite way to spend the weekend. My boyfriend of the past 3 years is a white dude from rural Ohio. I go shoot in gun range sometimes because it's fun. I have done road trips around the East Coast. I integrated the fuck out of my experience. And it was great!\n\nBut believe me when I say I regret all of that and felt that I should spend more time with the Vietnamese community, talking to my parents and studying. \n\nHere's the thing, the visa restrictions on students mean everyone got 1-3year after graduation to either be so good with their skill to land a job in FAANG where you get sponsorship and 100k+ in salary, or you go home.

OP's interested in this as a CS student, not fucking around. If he's an art major or business major, of course I agree with you. But he's not. *He's a CS student.* And as a CS student myself, I felt that I definitely should have been more keen on my Math skills than becoming Americanized.\n\nInternational students cannot takeout student loans.

I don't care if it's street food or in a restaurant, whether you eat while sitting down or standing up, eat where you can see how your food is made. The best places always show how their food is made because the smell is how you attract customers on the street and your technique is always shown best that way, not to mention less heat in your business.\n\nEvery local got their favorite places to eat, depending on which neighborhood in Hanoi you're in. People in Hoan Kiem will have a vastly different preference in comparison to people in Cau Giay or people on the other side of the Red river. Just know that generally you can divide Hanoian food into 3 categories:\n\n1. M\u00f3n qu\u00ea/\u0111\u1eb7c s\u1ea3n. directly translated to specialized/countryside-style. Tend to be exotic-by-western-standard. I'm talking cobra-soaked rice moonshine, frog legs and chicken feet. Within this group I recommend ch\u1ea3 c\u00e1 l\u00e3 v\u1ecdng. Very edible for Westerners for something also very authentic and universally loved by us locals. Check out the OG restaurant that made the dish in 14 Ch\u1ea3 C\u00e1 H\u00e0ng B\u1ed3, H\u00e0 N\u1ed9i. There are places with better taste imo but this one is the OG taste.\n2. Streetfood. As the name suggests, these are the extremely healthy local fast food options that McDonalds literally [cannot compete with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9pthhpd7So&ab_channel=CNBC). B\u00e1nh M\u00ec, Ph\u1edf, and B\u00fan Ch\u1ea3 are some standard options in this group. Everyone eats them for lunch and breakfast. If you see places on the street where there are many motorbikes in the front, go eat there. They are literally everywhere on every street so I feel like I should give a top 10 for each type of dish. But one place you can start with is [B\u00fan Ch\u1ea3 H\u01b0\u01a1ng Li\u00ean](https://www.facebook.com/bunchahuonglienobama/), where Obama and Anthony Bourdain had their meal when they came to Hanoi. Very affordable too.\n3. Vietnamized foreign dish. If you want some weird take on traditionally western food, Hanoi also has plenty of that. [Pizza4p](https://pizza4ps.com/) is the best-rated restaurant in Hanoi. They sell salmon pizza and other fusion pizza options. Highly recommend if you want to be pleasantly surprised by non-standard recipes.\n\nDrinks: Arguably more diverse than food. Egg coffee in Cafe \u0110inh, 1000 types of bubble tea everywhere, etc.\n\n\bHave fun dude.

In VN, a big chunk, if not the vast majority of care facilities are for kids/adults that look like [this](https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/09/gettyimages-119284263.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1286).\n\nThere are around 250,000-500,000 people like them and they are the 2nd and 3rd generation victims of agent orange. What that means is their parent or grandparents lived in places where agent orange were sprayed, or drink water from rivers that flow through those places.\n\nMost people who were originally exposed didn't develop symptoms right away, but their kids have deformities that ranged from enlarged/deformed skulls to deformed spine and some heart conditions. Many kids were born without limbs and others without eyes. All of them born from either Vietnamese soldiers or people in regions that were previously sprayed with agent orange. There are American soldiers whose sons and daughters were affected by this too.\n\nAnyways, the problem is the US government refused to have anything to do with this until very very recently. They ignored the whole thing because it's actually extremely hard to prove a chemical \"used for deforestation only\" caused something that showed up only in the next generations of people who inhaled/drink it. So by the time scientists were able to conclusively found the link, we have already gotten to the third generation of people being affected.\n\nOnly very recently do American soldiers in the Vietnam war became eligible for compensation for Agent Orange-related deformities in their sons and daughters, and the US government has not given a single dime to the Vietnamese families affected by this. What they did do, is pay for the \"cleaning\" of areas that were sprayed, vast areas where after 50 years, no crops could grow on because that's how much the soil was fucked.\n\nI highly suggest this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMzJvwG2rsQ&t=6s&ab_channel=UnreportedWorld) made by a disabled British guy about his time in Vietnam.

I also lived my entire life in an urban setting.\n\nHowever, my mom (who's multilingual and is super keen on making sure all her children are also multilingual) made a point to hire American tutors to talk to me in English since I was a 5yo, so I speak fluent English with an American midwestern accent by the time I was in my teenage years.\n\nA few years earlier, I moved to the US for college as an international student and quickly realize **I don't know shit about American/Midwestern culture at all**. Note that when I came to the US for college, it was also the first time I have ever even travelled to an English-speaking country. I was clueless about church culture, lawns, car culture, and all the small nitty-gritty things that made up life in Ohio. The worst part was I had been absolutely clueless about the racial aspects of the US, both when it comes to how people perceive me as an asian-looking person and how I'm supposed to act towards the black and white people around me. Looking back, it's insane how much etiquette there is amongst different racial groups in the US, and how subtle they can be, which makes it even harder for someone who was young and coming from a very racially homogenous society to notice and adapt to. \n\nI'm not saying that the concept of race doesn't exist in Vietnam, I'm saying that if anyone had made a joke to teenage me linking watermelon/fried chicken to black people, I would have just been so confused because I wouldn't even understand how black people and watermelon have anything to do with each other (I still don't get it tbh). \n\nAt the same time, I speak fluent English with the most generic Midwestern accent, so many Americans around me assumed I grew up in the US or at least have spent a good chunk of my childhood here, and hence, assumed I understand the common subtext in daily social interactions that I absolutely did not. For example, when I was a first-year student, I used to wonder why my American friends were so \"excited\" about drinking. I did not understand that in the US, people can't drink until they're 21, so what my friends did was considered illegal, freeing, part of the college experience, etc. while to me it's just alcohol.\n\nSo for years, I had to actively explain to people around me that I'm not American, so please excuse me if I don't understand something so simple as what \"charades\" is, while still be able to explain myself perfectly fine in English.\n\nIf anything, my first few years in the US made me realize that there's a surprisingly big gap between language and culture!", "created_utc": "1624938731.0", "edited": "1624953094.0", "id": "h3eig53", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_o9x5wr", "parent_id": "t3_o9x5wr", "score": "34", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "RemoteAnalysis3809", "body": "\nOr we might just end up like Lybia, Egypt or Iran, or the Philippines, or some Latin American countries back then with a dictatorship backed by the CIA.

The idea is you can be Han as long as you can read Han characters and subscribe to Confucius values, doesn't matter if you're born Korean or American, or what you look like. Under this lens, you actually don't even need to be Chinese to be Han, so modern Chinese people claiming Korea culturally appropriating Han culture is actually misunderstanding the historical context, and so are the Koreans who claim those intangible cultural artifacts that should belong to everyone subscribing to Confucius values, not just people from Korea.\n\nTldr: The ethnicity/nationality concepts we have now does not match that old philosophy of Han at all, causing so much hatred in the process.", "created_utc": "1623551577.0", "edited": "1623611044.0", "id": "h1kwqi0", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_ny3rap", "parent_id": "t1_h1jeq7r", "score": "14", "subreddit": "leagueoflegends", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rfxx"}, {"author": "RemoteAnalysis3809", "body": "I think many Americans don't understand that a lot of Chinese \"problems\" aren't 100% due to its politics, but are consequences of this combination of overpopulation and deeply collectivist cultural values.

But what most Americans don't realize is the sex imbalance in babies, which is the result of deliberately aborting female fetuses, is also a problem in Taiwan, Korea and Vietnam, countries with no one-child policy. Many Americans also don't understand that the reason why people want to have male babies so bad in these cultures is that men are culturally expected to take care of their elderly, dying parents, while women don't have to bear this responsibility. And no, the government in all these countries don't bear the responsibility of care for the elderly because CULTURALLY that's part of the filial piety practices that their families are supposed to adhere to.\n\nI'm a woman, and it pains me to see the sex-imbalance issue (that my country is also experiencing) being painted as sexism against women, when the cultural reality is much deeper and more complicated. I could also give you more examples of \"problems\" that are rampant in so many places with similar culture, but only China is being called out for (exotic endangered-animal food consumption, dog meat, long working hours in bad working conditions, face/high-conformity societal expectations, etc.). \n\nAll of this is to say, China is being so heavily politicized in US media, that all of its social problems are being painted as a result of the CCP being an oppressive political entity, instead of the 1000 other deeper cutural reasons that has been there since before the CCP even existed. The problem with that kind of thinking is the same as saying racism against black people in the US is a purely legislative/political problem, and if the federal government will just stop being so racist, there would be no racism in the US. Obviously, that's bullshit. \n\nI'm not saying that the CCP is some saint organization, what I am saying is that **the US has this tradition of simplifying a foreign country's culture and religious problems down to a political problem, so they think a change in regime will solve everything**.

Believe me when I say the anti-Chinese sentiment I see in the US is nowhere near the kind of flag-burning, protesting Chinese-owned-factory smashing sentiment I have seen at home in Vietnam. \n\n At the age of 18, I moved to the US for college and that's when I got to know actual Chinese people who were students from mainland China. I felt closer on a cultural level to them more than any other groups on campus, whether it's other international student groups or domestic American students, or even second gen Vietnamese-Americans. We all celebrate the Lunar New Year together, have lots of Confucius/Laozi/Buddhist influence in our values and basically all don't get why Americans wear shoes in their house.\n\nStrangely enough, it's exactly their nationalism/patriotism that I find myself connecting with most. It's like looking at my own sense of nationalism to my own country from the outside and realizing that it's all bullshit. But still acknowledge that the propaganda is so deep in you already that to separate it from your familial connection, childhood events and personal identity is quite impossible.\n\nBeyond that, so many of us students from either Islamic countries or Socialist-in-name ones like China and Vietnam have had Americans trying to tell us that we are oppressed and are in need of saving by either Jesus (my university is in the Bible belt) or some political ideology depending on the kind of American who's talking. \n\nLike I have lived here long enough to see where these Americans come from, but I really do wish people understand that international students are pretty much your worst audiences for these types of convincing.

People do value Vietnamese literature in public education here. \"beautiful writing\" in Vietnamese has a lot to do with *subtlety, metaphor and literary devices of such types*.\n\nVietnamese literature can be divided by genres/topics, forms or time period.\n\nGenres/topics: nationalistic works (some of them are genuinely good even if most of the ones featured in K12 textbooks are literal communist propaganda), feminist works, familial works, romance, poverty-depictions, royalty depictions, historical, etc.\n\nForms: poems or long form. Within poems you got l\u1ee5c b\u00e1t (6/8) form, th\u1ea5t ng\u00f4n b\u00e1t c\u00fa (7/8) form, t\u1ef1 do (free) form. *This is very different from English poetry.* Some of the classic names here are H\u1ed3 Xu\u00e2n H\u01b0\u01a1ng (feminist poet in the 1700s/1800s who was most famous for her sexual poems, yet her works are still featured in middle school and highschool textbooks), Nguy\u1ec5n Du (Tale of Kieu's author), H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh (a surprisingly humorous poet who has written about both his politics and how to take a shit in a Chinese prison before), etc.\n\n I think if you can *feel* Vietnamese poems and understand why the rhythms and tones go the way they do, you have reached native-level Vietnamese fluency. It's because to all native Viets I know, l\u1ee5c b\u00e1t poems are like songs. Understanding their form comes very naturally, even for young kids who just learned to read. \n\nAnd then you have long-form. These are novels, short stories, etc. If you want some social insights into Vietnamese society throughout the time, I highly recommend these. V\u0169 Tr\u1ecdng Ph\u1ee5ng (S\u1ed1 \u0110\u1ecf author), Nam Cao (Ch\u00ed Ph\u00e8o, M\u1ed9t B\u1eefa No, L\u00e3o H\u1ea1c author), Th\u1ea1ch Lam, etc. are some of the big writers whose works are frequently featured in Vietnamese literature textbooks. There works are often sobering in tone, and often depict themes of poverty, descend into madness, etc. \n\nFor example, L\u00e3o H\u1ea1c is the story of an old man and his dog during the great 1945 famine. This old man has a son who's a slave at a coffee plantation far away, so he lives alone with his dog who he loves so much. During the famine, the old man got nothing to eat and considered selling his dog to the local dog meat shop in exchange for food. Eventually he did sell his dog, then killed himself the day after. This story is quite a Vietnamese classics. \n\nAnd then you got division by time. This is because Old Vietnamese were not written in Latin alphabet form, but in Chinese (H\u00e1n) and logographic Vietnamese (N\u00f4m) characters. This means there are significant differences in how you can read the words.\n\nFor example, the first declaration of Independence in Vietnam is (ironically) written in Chinese (H\u00e1n) characters. When we learned this work in 7th grade, they had to print out three different versions of the text for students to fully grasp the meaning of the work:\n\nThe first version is he original version (Ch\u1eef H\u00e1n). Trying to read that shit as a Vi\u1ec7t native speaker is like reading Shakespeare as an American. But you still need to read it to understand the poetic/rhythmic/tonal aspect of the work. \n\nThe second version is the translation to modern Vietnamese (D\u1ecbch Ngh\u0129a). This is where you read to understand the meaning of the text. Easy to understand but not poetic at all to read.\n\nThe third version combines both through a modern poetic translation of the work (D\u1ecbch Th\u01a1). This is basically some modern translator's attempt to capture both the poetry and the meaning of the original text, but written through a modern Vietnamese lens. \n\nI'm usually bored reading these ancient works so I can't remember any authors. Most of their works are not online and is only available in Vietnamese national libraries anyways. \n\nSo there you have it.

It's the difference between saying \"interNAtional\" and \" inTERnational\" in English, or the difference between \"HAshi\" (chopstick) and \"haSHI\" (bridge) in Japanese. One definitely feels more native than the other. So I treat learning these stress patterns in English and Japanese the same way I treat learning words with different tones in Mandarin. You get it so wrong at the start and nobody can understand you, but later on you acquire the ability to get it right naturally.\n\nAnd then there's the monotone/non-tonal confusion. No English native speakers I know speak in a monotone. People go up at the end of a sentence, go down after they say \"but\", etc. But I found myself speaking in a monotone at the beginning of my English studying because I didn't know the \"flow\" of an English sentence yet. I assumed **no tone means monotone**. \n\nSo I guess being a tonal-language-native-speaker makes me more prone to being emotionless when I speak non-tonal languages. \n\nI notice the opposite thing happening with English native speakers trying to learn Vietnamese: Their intonation goes up at the end of a question even when the tones say to go down. When they want to express uncertainty, their intonation goes up even when the tones don't tell them to. Basically, they tend to apply English sentence-level intonation to individual Vietnamese words without realizing they are doing it. And in that process, they bypass what the tones tell them to do. \n\nP.S: It's nice you notice the economic relationship with the languages I choose.

I'm a Vietnamese native speaker who studied English, Mandarin and Japanese in that order, and I definitely do notice the difference in information rate transferred.\n\nEdit: Especially by syllable. Japanese is the worst since there is no ending consonants in most syllables and no tones. On the other hand, Vietnamese has 6 tones and 80% of all one-syllable words have ending consonants. \n\nEnglish and Mandarin fall somewhere in the middle. Each English word is made up of multiple syllables like Japanese words does, but each syllable is more likely to have ending/starting consonants than Japanese words do. Mandarin words are like Vietnamese ones (except less tones) in that most words are made up of one to two syllables, but that syllable has ending consonants and tones, so the meaning delivered in one syllable is denser than English words do.\n\nFor example, the word in-ter-na\b-tion-al has 5 syllables, but only two of those syllables have both starting and ending consonants.

With the second poem, only one version is needed as the work is very similar to modern Vietnamese.\n\nClassical Chinese evolution in Vietnam into Sino-Vietnamese elements and ch\u1eef N\u00f4m reflects the history of the country a lot. Vietnam was part of some Chinese kingdoms and dynasties for almost 1000 years as [\u4ea4\u8dbe](https://hvdic.thivien.net/whv/%E4%BA%A4%E8%B6%BE), then broke away in 938 though maintained a vassal state status for quite some time after that.

It's not close to any modern Chinese speaking language at all. The idea is if a 17th-century Vietnamese guy looks at my name in Classical Chinese, he will be able to say my name is \\*insert Vietnamese pronunciation of my name\\*, even if he cannot speak Chinese. Almost all modern Vietnamese names can be \bwritten in Classical Chinese, and about 60% of modern Vietnamese vocab is what we called Sino-Vietnamese words.\n\nBut then the further back you go, the more Chinese influence there is in my language (or at least the formal textual version of it).
