For my other ear which had a virus attack (or a burst blood vessel - the doctors don't know which) a hearing aid improves my life enormously but I try to get people to sit on my other side, where I can hear better.\n\nMy aids are [Phonak](https://www.hearingdirect.com/collections/receiver-in-canal-hearing-aids?constraint=brand_phonak&utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=17341985900&gclid=Cj0KCQjw1bqZBhDXARIsANTjCPIsdWY2j2WgfYdWKWeXr1dzHSzQvjN2hl07pF43hCausJxo9WLgY4kaAqqBEALw_wcB) ones, where the speaker is in the ear and I have an open dome. If she has more severe hearing loss she may need moulds, which fill the ear more fully to avoid feedback.\n\nAs a HOH person, I hear best in quiet rooms, when people face me, and when I can see people's faces. I sometimes need to ask people to repeat things. I prefer people to repeat their exact same words but louder and clearer whereas other HOH people prefer a paraphrase - so you could go either way with that.\n\nSometimes I mishear and I find that amusing, a bit like misreading 'shopfitters' as 'shoplifters' and I can have a laugh about it. Other people find it more irritating when they mishear especially if people make a joke of it. \n\nMy husband won't wear an aid and I never know if he has heard or not because he doesn't always acknowledge what he has heard. So silence might mean he has nothing to say in reply, or it might mean he hasn't heard at all.\n\nIt's easy to feel excluded if you're in a noisy place and friends are laughing and joking but you can't hear the jokes. Having to have everything repeated or explained can slow things up and spoil everyone's fun. The temptation can be to withdraw. (I deal with it by arriving early while it's quiet, and leaving when I stop being able to hear. That way I get a decent bit of socialising in.)\n\nWithout my aids I can hear people talking but not make out what they are saying, although I can tell if they are laughing, arguing, happy, sad, etc, but it's like everyone is mumbling. So I really love my aids! But many HOH people find that they are tiring or irritating to wear, so you have a lot of choice about how your MC sees hers.\n\nI think it makes a difference at what age you lose some or all of your hearing. Mine started to go when I was around 40; you might want to talk to people who lost theirs earlier.\n\nI have a fairly robust attitude to my hearing loss. I usually tell people when I meet them so that they can make allowances, and I'll often take out my aids to show people how good they look! Other people may be embarrassed about it, or shy. Again, you can realistically choose from a range of options.\n\nAs it's fantasy, you can also afford to do a bit of handwaving if you feel like it. It's really very open for you to decide how you want it to be.\n\nIf you want to ask me any questions you can do that here or in PMs. Hope some of this helps!", "created_utc": "1664021927.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ippjhj7", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_xmpom6", "parent_id": "t3_xmpom6", "score": "6", "subreddit": "hardofhearing", "subreddit_id": "t5_2ukr5"}, {"author": "fairyhedgehog", "body": "That really helps.

Swabs are weighted, and you turn the clarinet upside down, drop the weight through it, catch the weight and turn the clarinet right side up to pull the swab through. Make sure the string and cloth aren't in any way tangled - it's quite scary if the swab gets stuck and you have to separate the clarinet parts to free it.\n\nRemove and dry the reed and store it safely.

I didn't find the information on resources on the page that u/astronoutos linked to - I'm sure it's there but I couldn't find it. So here's my personal list:\n\n[Duolingo](https://www.duolingo.com) is great for getting a lot of practice. It doesn't start where you need to start for getting around in Germany and has a few really daft sentences but bear with it, it can be very helpful. Do always read the \"tips\" for each lesson - that's where the actual lessons are! It is good for reading, listening, and speaking and to some extent for writing. It's probably the easiest place to start.\n\n[Nicos Weg](https://learngerman.dw.com/en/beginners/c-36519789) is a course on the Deutsche Welle site that should take you from A1 to I think B1. I find it a bit daunting because it uses a lot of German at natural language speed. It is very good on grammar though and I do often make use of it.\n\n[Clozemaster](https://www.clozemaster.com) is great for vocabulary. It will teach you the most frequent words more or less in order and in context. Like Duolingo you can chop and change between using a word bank or typing in the words. I find it fun and often use it.\n\nThose are all free resources and probably enough to get you started!\n\nWhen you've got a bit more German under your belt, you might like to read [Angelika Bohm's books](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Angelika-Bohn/e/B00L7F0QLA?ref=sr_ntt_srch_lnk_1&qid=1618560516&sr=1-1). They are specifically for learners, and take you from A1 to B2, but they are just a supplement to give you some pleasure in reading. I really like them.\n\nI've also got a lot of use from a print book: [Collins Easy Learning Complete German](https://www.waterstones.com/book/easy-learning-german-complete-grammar-verbs-and-vocabulary-3-books-in-1/collins-dictionaries/9780008141783). I thought the vocabulary section was pretty useless, but the parts on grammar and verbs have been a great resource to refer to.\n\nI also bought a German/English dictionary but in these days of Google Translate and DeepL (an alternative to Google Translate) I haven't made much use of it.\n\nI hope some of this helps, and good luck with your language learning!", "created_utc": "1618561041.0", "edited": "False", "id": "gupanrm", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_mru7mf", "parent_id": "t3_mru7mf", "score": "3", "subreddit": "German", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qq51"}, {"author": "fairyhedgehog", "body": "If they don't make notes of your number (which I'm guessing they won't) the chances of them remembering it have to be pretty much non-existent.\n\nAlthough I'd have thought they'd have your contact details anyway.\n\nIt sounds like a scary thing to do - I've not had to take any exams in German - so good luck and I hope it goes well.", "created_utc": "1618559641.0", "edited": "False", "id": "gup9647", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_mrxv85", "parent_id": "t1_gup6he7", "score": "2", "subreddit": "German", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qq51"}, {"author": "fairyhedgehog", "body": "Great game!
