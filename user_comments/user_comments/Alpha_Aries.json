Everyone else seems to be worried about their plans for after university, who they\u2019ll invite to their parties, or what IKEA furniture to buy. I\u2019m so envious.\n\nYou're speaking to my soul, here. I was you, just 8 years ago.\n\nOCD is rare. So before I was diagnosed, I would ask people, \"is it normal to have thoughts like this?\", \"am I struggling more than others?\", \"what's wrong with me?\", and the one I kept puzzling over for too long: **\"is it normal to suffer this much at this age?\"**\n\nAnd I thought, god damn! I am suffering a *lot!* My brain will not let up on me. I have constant distressing thoughts. So if this is normal... I'm not sure how much more I can take.\n\nSo you know, I'm sure, just how dark this illness can get. \n\nAnd the answer to those questions is: *You ARE suffering more than the average person.* \n\nI had to (painfully) accept that I was going to be impaired for a while. And I was going to have different needs compared to my peers. \n\nBut also, that my peers are suffering with other issues that they hide.\n\nMental illnesses tend to show up in our early 20s. Some of your peers haven't gotten struck yet. Some of them are masking it with alcohol or other substances. And some of them are hiding it very, very well.\n\nI know this because I knew these people. And in our late 20s, we've managed to crawl our way out. \n\nSo while your peers struggle with their own demons, I want you to focus on you. What are you going to do to make this easier for yourself? I'd recommend setting boundaries with yourself. So maybe you're not someone who can handle going out with friends every weekend because you need to recover from the week. So maybe you're someone who needs to go to bed at 9 p.m. on the dot every night, and needs 10 hours of sleep to function. There's absolutely nothing wrong with that.\n\nI made it out of my early 20s - I almost didn't. I *see* you and I know that you are suffering. And yes, probably more than the average person.

We hope to provide a space for you to feel heard and understood, no matter what your OCD theme is. \n\nIn this group, know that you\u2019ll never have to disclose what you\u2019re struggling with if you\u2019re not comfortable. Please know you're not alone - others with OCD in the group understand you, and may even be experiencing a similar debilitating and embarrassing OCD theme. \n\nThe Workshop will not be recorded, and all cameras will be off for the duration of the event. During the Workshop, you will complete an activity centered around granting yourself self-compassion on your OCD recovery journey.\n\n**While this event will NOT be recorded, but if you register for the Workshop, we will send you the worksheet and instructions for the activity after if you cannot attend**\n\nAfter registering, you will receive a confirmation email about joining the webinar.\u201d", "created_utc": "1666153445.0", "edited": "False", "id": "iswcm7p", "is_submitter": "True", "link_id": "t3_y7snxl", "parent_id": "t3_y7snxl", "score": "2", "subreddit": "OCDRecovery", "subreddit_id": "t5_47xlol"}, {"author": "Alpha_Aries", "body": "Fry is so cute. \ud83d\ude0d", "created_utc": "1665860415.0", "edited": "False", "id": "isg66bi", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_y3km6p", "parent_id": "t3_y3km6p", "score": "2", "subreddit": "OCDRecovery", "subreddit_id": "t5_47xlol"}, {"author": "Alpha_Aries", "body": "Did the same thing.

If I get reassurance from someone, the anxiety will disappear again.*\n\nThus begins the thought/reassurance loop, or the **obsession/compulsion loop**.\n\nSometimes, your original reassurance may be enough for the OCD sufferer to feel okay.

If my checking didn't sufficiently reassure me that my food was clean, I'd throw it away and order takeout.\n* Researching online... I'd say the biggest difference between \"\"normal\"\" Googling and my OCD fearful Googling was the *level* of fear I felt while Googling, and just how *long* I used to Google for. I spent 2-3 hours at a time just Googling, lying in bed, rubbing my feet together in discomfort.\n\nI spent a combined 5+ hours of doing compulsions a day. Exhausting.\n\n**Now that I'm in recovery:**\n\nI noticed there are still things that make me anxious, but not to the emergency levels I used to feel. I've gotten so much better at being mindful. However, I noticed I can succumb to these compulsions sometimes, if I'm not being mindful:\n\n* Re-reading what I write. I am a writer by day, and have been writing my whole life, but I still read and re-read what I write just to make myself \"feel good?\" Really weird to explain unless you have OCD. I will do this repeatedly throughout the day if I'm having a stressful day, but I seem to catch it after about 5 minutes of re-reading.\n* Replaying scenarios, overthinking. These are harder to pull my brain away from. I can at least notice that they're unhealthy, now. I used to identify with these bouts of overthinking, assuming that I was doing myself a favor by \"solving the problem.\" Now I recognize I don't solve anything. I just make myself upset. On stressful days, I can do this for 20-30 minutes.\n* I am extremely vigilant about anything contamination-related, so I spend zero time doing my old compulsions. I really don't want to be as bad as I was before!\n\nI will now spend 30 minutes a day or less doing compulsions, roughly. This subreddit really helps me focus on recovery.

I think you\u2019re going the right route of doing your ERP, trying to be mindful, meditating, and taking medication. Those are all going to go a long way, though they may take some time. \n\nSecond, how long have you been on medication, what is it, and what dose? If you don\u2019t mind me asking\n\nThird, the thing I\u2019d like to add is that it\u2019s really important to have your self-care on lock for these next couple of months. If possible, cut down to part-time work/school. Really make sure your basic needs are taken care of:\n- 3 meals a day, and a snack or two\n- 8-10 hours of sleep (sounds like a lot, but anxiety is draining)\n- daily walks, breathing exercises, stepping away from screens to be in nature. Pet animals if that helps with your mood. (My cats really make me laugh with their silliness). \n- something YOU ENJOY, doesn\u2019t matter what, to get your mind off anything to do with OCD. a couple hours a day of this. \n- talk to someone who cares about you. Doesn\u2019t have to be about OCD. In fact, I recommend talking about anything but OCD. A sense of normalcy is extremely important, and you don\u2019t want to get caught in a rumination cycle with your (well-meaning) friend. \n\nAfter that, really get to the bottom of what scares you, and write it all down. Give it to your ERP therapist to begin exposures together. \n\nIf he seems unhelpful, check out NOCD.

Moreover, the repetitive behaviors of OCD seem to weaken memory trust (Van den Hout and Kindt 2004). However, the cause of the initial low confidence of OCD patients in their own memory capacities is unclear. **Our findings of inattention and attention switch problems in OCD patients raise an interesting possibility, i.e. that these problems may, at least partially, be responsible for the low confidence of OCD patients in their cognitive processes.** Difficulties in the management of attention may serve as a common factor between OCD, ADHD and ASD symptoms and explain the pathological doubt/uncertainty that seems to characterize these disorders \u2026 \n\nIn conclusion: OCD patients exhibit increased rates of ADHD, and autism symptoms. Problems with attention switching seems to be a strong predictor of OC severity and OC symptom dimensions, and might explain the lack of confidence in ones\u2019 own cognitive processes that are typical for OCD.

Big or small, doesn\u2019t matter. Here\u2019s some ideas I did in therapy:\n\n- write words and phrases I\u2019m scared of on sticky notes. Stick them around my house. \n\n- write those words and phrases ten times each, then say them aloud ten times each. \n\n- write \u201cI may or may not\u2026\u201d in front of each word/phrase. Write that sentence ten times for each word/phrase. Example: \u201cI may or may not turn gay out of nowhere. I may or may not be turned on by gay porn. I may or may not see a man I find sexually attractive.\u201d (Adjust these sentences according to your theme - maybe: \u201cI may or may not be spat on if people find out my secret. I may or may not be disowned by everyone if they find out. People may or may not find out.\u201d). \n\n- say that sentence aloud ten times each. \n\n- if a \u201cwhat if\u201d enters your head, you have to say, \u201cyep, that could possibly happen. I\u2019m going to continue on with my life anyways.\u201d Avoid researching online or asking others for reassurance. \n\n- read an article online about someone finding out a secret about someone and disowning them. Avoid compulsions afterwards. (When my therapist made me do this one, it was so scary! It really stuck in my head for a few days afterwards. Maybe this could be a 9/10 on the anxiety scale for you?)\n\n- attack \u201cwhat if\u201d thoughts with sarcasm and exaggeration. \u201cYep. If people find out, I bet they will all rally around and burn me at the stake lol. I\u2019m sure everyone will be SOOO interested in my life to point and laugh at me. I bet it\u2019ll be broadcast all over the news!\u201d\n\n- write down my absolute worst case scenario and be very descriptive. Let the what ifs reach their final conclusion. Mine involved food being contaminated, I have to call 911, no one helps me, and I die by suicide even though I love my life. Read it aloud several times. Really feel the anxiety. After about a week or so of doing this, the worst case scenario sounded so dramatic and ridiculous that I roll my eyes now just thinking about it. You want to get to the point where your worst case scenario sounds boring/ridiculous. \n\n- bonus if you deal with panic attacks: notice a panic attack about to come on (shaking, dizziness, heavy chest, etc).
