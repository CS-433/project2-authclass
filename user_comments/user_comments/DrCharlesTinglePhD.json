And because I might not need to use those structures or words very often, it's easy to forget them by the time I actually need them.\n\nThis sounds like you're not drilling with a spaced-repetition system (SRS). I strongly recommend you start doing this. Take a Hindi movie, get the Hindi captions, and chop it up into sentences. Put each sentence into a card. The audio will be the question side, and the text will be the answer side. For each card, you listen to the audio (multiple times when necessary), and then try to write out the text.\n\nDo it in reverse, too. Put the text on the question side and the speech on the answer side. Read the text and try to pronounce it. Then play the speech back, and a recording of your voice back. Do they match? If not, you failed the card, so try again.\n\nAnother way you can do this is to extract dialogues. Take a conversation from a movie between two people. Then, on the question side of the card, put the audio of one of the people, with silent pauses in place of the second person (the pauses should be a little longer than the original audio, but only a little). On the answer side of the card, you put the full dialogue, with both sides of the conversation. When you do the card, play the audio, and try to respond as the second person does. Record yourself responding. Then play back the full conversation, and then your performance of the conversation, and compare them.\n\n> I try to review vocab a lot, but even with vocab it's hard to know how to correctly use it in a sentence\n\nHow are you studying grammar and vocabulary? What I do and recommend is to study through example sentences. In your SRS, on the answer side of the card should be a complete sentence in your target language. The question side can be anything that will remind you of the target language sentence: either an English sentence that means something close to the target sentence (you can take these from a textbook or a Hindi-English dictionary with example sentences), or an audio recording of a native speaker saying the sentence.

You can learn a new script, if it is simple enough, in a month or so. The Korean, Thai, and Khmer scripts, for example, are not especially difficult, as I understand it. \n\nI don't have much experience with tonal languages, but tonality does not actually seem to be a big barrier in practice. I have not heard of intermediate students of Chinese struggling with tones the way intermediate (and advanced... and even native) students of Japanese struggle with kanji.\n\nI have some familiarity with Japanese and Khmer. I would say Japanese is much harder than Khmer, because Khmer grammar is simpler, and the vocabulary is smaller. Why? Well, until quite recently (around 1950), Cambodia was 99% composed of illiterate farmers. There is no large corpus of Khmer literature. Khmer does have a social hierarchy that is encoded into the language, much like Korean and Japanese, but as I understand it, it was greatly simplified because of the Pol Pot government.\n\nAnd that's all aside from the writing system. I'm convinced at this point that Japanese has the most difficult writing system of any major language. It's not just that Japanese uses Chinese characters. It's that they are used so inconsistently. In Chinese, each character has one pronunciation. In Japanese, nearly every Chinese character has at least two pronunciations, one based on Chinese and one based on native Japanese, but often more. The Chinese-originated pronunciations are based on borrowing from different stages of Chinese-language development, from disparate periods of history, and so are inconsistent with each other. The pronunciation that you need depends on the context, and in the case of proper names, it's often impossible to actually guess the pronunciation.\n\nAnd then there is the way that they have another phonetic script, and you can write anything in the phonetic script - but should you? There's a delicate balance between using too many Chinese characters and too few, which depends on the situation. Does your audience know this character? Do they know that this word can be written in Chinese characters? Should I put the pronunciation on the side? If I write it in the phonetic script, is there a homonym that could be easily confused with it (Japanese has a lot of homonyms)? And if you're bold and inventive enough, you can just take a character and invent your own pronunciation for it. The Chinese language has none of this.\n\nThe Khmer writing system is comparatively easy. It is very consistent - what you see is what you say (except that final consonants are usually silent, like in French). The hardest part about learning Khmer is that there's hardly anything to read.\n\nAnyway, my guess is that because China independently invented writing, and Korea and Japan adopted that writing system, they have a longer history of writing, and larger vocabularies and grammars. All of the Southeast Asian languages adopted writing (except for Vietnamese, originating, ultimately, from Phoenician, like European languages) later on, they have a somewhat shorter history of writing, and their languages are not quite as complicated as a result.", "created_utc": "1649735494.0", "edited": "False", "id": "i4dvqvp", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_u0rcnu", "parent_id": "t3_u0rcnu", "score": "2", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "DrCharlesTinglePhD", "body": "I think it's possible with [this](http://wiibrew.org/wiki/AnyRegion_Changer).

So I'd avoid this one.\n\nOtherwise I think they're all fine. Basically every game on the Wii is better than the previous game. The later games are also a bit more tolerant with the timing windows. Each game can unlock all the tracks in the previous game. There's a save file on GameFAQs for unlocking everything in the last game, DDR II.

Almost everything in the menus is in plain English, or English in katakana, so it takes only a very low level of Japanese ability to play the Japanese Wii games. And the menus are the same as the NA/EU games anyway, so once you familiarize yourself with the English versions, you can probably play the Japanese versions with zero Japanese ability.

Seattle itself is mostly pretty suburban, to be honest. And as far as actual suburbs go, going either north or south is going to be cheaper than going east. I'd suggest checking out some northern suburbs, like Shoreline or Lynnwood.", "created_utc": "1643098504.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hu4oef1", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_sba6yz", "parent_id": "t1_hu3jj8m", "score": "0", "subreddit": "eastside", "subreddit_id": "t5_2sazx"}, {"author": "DrCharlesTinglePhD", "body": "I use Mint, and I'm very happy with them.\n\nThe only place I seem to not get a good signal is at my own house.

We get people asking here about the best games every day, but they're usually starting from already having a Wii. So I have more than five games I can recommend.\n\nThe first thing that comes to mind for playing best on the Wii are shooting games:\n\n* **Sin and Punishment: Star Successor** - a rail shooter, but you have a character to move around on the screen, dodging attacks; some of the best graphics on the Wii\n* **Zombie Panic in Wonderland** - thematically a cross between medieval Japan and The Wizard of Oz, with zombies; a two-player gallery shooter where you must also dodge attacks\n* **Dead Space: Extraction** - rail shooter; actually kind of a scary game\n* **Resident Evil: Umbrella Chronicles** and **Resident Evil: Darkside Chronicles** - the Resident Evil story, adapted into a rail shooter\n* **Ghost Squad** - port of 4-player arcade rail shooter\n* **Dino Strike** - 4-player (or 2-player dual-wield) rail shooter; shoot dinosaurs\n* **GoldenEye 007** - first-person shooter inspired by the N64 classic, supports 4-player split-screen (supposedly you can still play online, although I have not tried this yet)\n* **Water Warfare** - first-person shooter with water guns; good for kids; supports split-screen play and online play (although not at the same time, sadly)\n\nSome games which make good use of the motion control (and haven't been ported to the Switch, last I checked):\n\n* **de Blob 1 and 2** - paint the town, because some evil entity stole all the color\n* **Trauma Center: Second Opinion** - perform surgery (I am too squeamish to play this actually, but my brother loves it); sequel of DS game Trauma Center: Under the Knife\n* **Trauma Center: New Blood** - remake of DS game Trauma Center: Under the Knife\n* **Trauma Team** - sequel to Second Opinion; now it's not just surgery\n* **Super Monkey Ball: Banana Blitz** - guide a monkey inside a ball through courses, collecting bananas along the way\n* **Kororinpa: Marble Mania** - guide a marble through courses\n* **Marble Saga: Kororinpa** - sequel to the above game\n* **Mercury Meltdown Revolution** - guide a blob of mercury through courses\n\nOtherwise, (and this is a controversial opinion on this sub) the motion controls on the Wii are really too primitive to bother with most of the games that rely on them. The major exception is games that can use (or require) the MotionPlus, which works really well:\n\n* **Grand Slam Tennis** - best tennis game on the Wii\n* **Tiger Woods PGA Tour** (10, 11, and 12 support MotionPlus) - good golf games\n* **Zelda: Skyward Sword** - 3D Zelda, where you swing the remote to attack\n* **Red Steel 2** - you're some kind of futuristic samurai with both a sword and gun\n* **Wii Sports Resort** - skip the highly overrated Wii Sports and get this, which has some minigames with excellent gameplay\n\nOther than that are some good games that only saw releases on the Wii, for whatever reason:\n\n* **Tatsunoko versus Capcom** - Capcom-versus fighting games, this time with obscure-to-the-West Japanese animation studio Tatsunoko's characters (Classic Controller recommended)\n* **MadWorld** - super-violent beat-em-up set in an off-brand Manhattan, with a sort of noir look reminiscent of the Sin City comic books\n* **Muramasa: The Demon Blade** - side-scrolling RPG with phenomenal graphics (Classic Controller recommended)\n* **The Last Story** - pretty good role-playing game that will probably remind you of the Final Fantasy series, as it was directed by the creator of Final Fantasy (Classic Controller recommended)\n* **Rune Factory Frontier** - a cross between Harvest Moon and a dungeon crawler (Classic Controller recommended)\n* **Rabbids Go Home** - you play a bunch of crazy rabbits who have decided to grab enough garbage to build a pile to reach their home, the moon\n* **Battalion Wars 2** - solid tactics game; you can supposedly still play this online\n* **Epic Mickey 1 and 2** - 3D platformer in a noir Disney setting; second game is for two players\n* **Deadly Creatures** - platformer (sort of - you can walk on walls and ceilings), where you're alternately a tarantula or a scorpion, killing other animals\n* **Fire Emblem: Radian Dawn** - direct sequel to Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance on the Gamecube; a (very difficult) tactical role-playing game", "created_utc": "1641105584.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hqwoajc", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_rtvetb", "parent_id": "t3_rtvetb", "score": "4", "subreddit": "wii", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qi9g"}, {"author": "DrCharlesTinglePhD", "body": "Gamecube memory cards are just SD cards with gratuitous incompatibility, so it's possible to make your own adapter by harvesting the memory card port from a Gamecube or Wii.

The PS2 has more DDR releases and seems to be the most popular, but the Wii is going to be cheaper. I've never had a PS2, so I can't say much about it. But I play on the Wii every day.\n\nPlaying on a mat is obviously inferior to playing on an arcade machine. It's possible to get a hard pad hooked up to a console, but they are all USB these days, so it requires some hardware modifications to plug into an old console. It should in theory be possible to patch the games so that you can use a USB-connected pad on a Wii, and I might try to figure that out someday...\n\nI bought everything from Ebay. The console itself, plus the sensor bar, remote, video cable, and power supply will run about $50 usually, but possibly as little as $30. The mat will be about $20. I'm still on my first mat, but apparently they wear out periodically. Maybe 1-3 times a year, if you're playing at higher difficulty levels (which I am not, yet).\n\nThere were five main releases for the Wii:\n\n* Dance Dance Revolution Hottest Party\n* Dance Dance Revolution Hottest Party 2\n* Dance Dance Revolution Hottest Party 3\n* Dance Dance Revolution (US) or Dance Dance Revolution Hottest Party 4 (Europe)\n* Dance Dance Revolution II (US) or Dance Dance Revolution Hottest Party 5 (Europe)\n\nI find the first one to be hard to play, as the arrow speed can't be changed on that one. Aside from that, every release is better than the last, and the last one is the best - mostly because it has the most songs. The last release also supports doubles mode.\n\nYou can use later games to unlock all the songs on the previous game. So for example, you can create a save in Hottest Party, then load Hottest Party 2, and you can unlock all the songs in Hottest Party. Some of the games will automatically detect the old game's data on startup and unlock them, and for some of them you have to go into the options menu to do it. For the last game, you can find save data to download on GameFAQs which will unlock all the songs.\n\nIn the earlier games, they had a misfeature where you had to shake the remote or nunchuk in addition to stepping on the arrows. I actually destroyed a couple nunchuks trying to do this (the cables are too short for my arms, and I ripped them into two pieces). So... I'd just turn that feature off.\n\nThere were also a few releases using licensed themes:\n\n* Dance Dance Revolution Mario Mix (a Gamecube game, but the Wii is backward-compatible)\n* Dance Dance Revolution Disney Grooves\n* Dance Dance Revolution Winx Club (Europe only)\n\nI tried Mario Mix and Disney Grooves once or twice, and didn't like the music. I haven't tried Winx Club, but I understand that in addition to songs from the Winx TV show, it also includes some songs from the main series.\n\nI'd recommend [hacking your Wii](https://wii.guide), so you can dump the games to an SD card or hard drive, and save your disc drive all the wear and tear.", "created_utc": "1639504939.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hoje4kv", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_rfytre", "parent_id": "t3_rfytre", "score": "4", "subreddit": "DanceDanceRevolution", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s3qp"}, {"author": "DrCharlesTinglePhD", "body": "My 5 favorite games to play on the Wii:\n\n* **Dance Dance Revolution II** - step on arrows in time to the music\n* **Phantasy Star Online** - science fiction-themed role-playing game that you can still play online with private servers\n* **Rune Factory Frontier** - cross between farming simulation and role-playing game\n* **Muramasa: The Demon Blade** - medieval Japan-themed platforming role-playing game\n* **Baroque** - surreal psychological horror, in the form of a first-person Roguelike", "created_utc": "1639501533.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hoj5bih", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_rfrf0x", "parent_id": "t3_rfrf0x", "score": "3", "subreddit": "wii", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qi9g"}, {"author": "DrCharlesTinglePhD", "body": "The best source of information I've found is the [WiiBrew wiki](https://wiibrew.org/wiki/Main_Page).

These just use the remote; no extra hardware required.\n\nFor Dance Dance Revolution, the best game in the series is the last one, Dance Dance Revolution II, which is the most polished and has the most tracks. But all of the games are good. You'll need a mat, which can found on Ebay for $20 or so, and plugs into a Gamecube port.

The best game in the series is probably Explorer. You also need a mat for this. The mat for this series can also be found on Ebay for $20 or so, and plugs into the Gamecube port, but it's not compatible with the DDR mat.\n\nThe best tennis game on the Wii is Grand Slam Tennis, which can utilize (but does not require) MotionPlus. Next best is Mario Power Tennis, then the tennis mini-game in Wii Sports. At least for me, these seem to be much lower intensity than the above games.

I will do my best.\n\nThe Eastside is not, in general, very walkable. But neither is Seattle, to be honest. 80 or 90% of both places are low-density suburbia. You can not walk most places. That said, I have lived in both Seattle and the Eastside for years without a car, and it's doable.\n\nYou'll want to mostly stick to (and ideally live in) the most walkable areas with the best transit, which are:\n\n* Downtown Seattle (including Belltown, Pioneer Square, International District) and adjacent neighborhoods (First Hill, Capitol Hill, South Lake Union [aka Cascade], Queen Anne)\n* University District (in Seattle)\n* Downtown Bellevue\n* Crossroads (in Bellevue)\n* Downtown Redmond\n\nThere are other areas that people like to recommend like Downtown Kirkland, Spring District (in Bellevue), Central District (in Seattle), Columbia City (in Seattle), etc. but in my experience they only get recommended by people who drive, or people who are impressed by better-than-average walkability, rather than good walkability. I mean, they're easy to visit by bus, but I wouldn't want to live there.\n\nEast Link construction is a bit ahead of schedule at the moment. It might open December 2022. Current bus service on the Eastside is adequate. Several routes on the Eastside (550 Seattle to Bellevue, 545 Seattle Redmond, B Bellevue to Redmond, 271 University District to Issaquah, 245 Downtown Kirkland to Factoria) run every 15 minutes during most of the day. Or I should say: they used to run every 15 minutes, and they've been cut back temporarily because of covid. There are several other less frequent routes that go almost anywhere you might want to go.\n\nTaxis are sometimes easy to find in and around Downtown Seattle, sometimes not so easy. I wouldn't rely on them anywhere else. I have used Lyft on the Eastside a couple times, and it worked OK, but as both they and Uber are losing money hand over fist, I wouldn't rely on them.\n\nIf you're working on the Eastside, I would be wary of living in Seattle. Buses between Seattle and the Eastside are more reliable than you might expect, as they mostly run in HOV lanes, but they can still be subject to horrendous delays on local streets.\n\nEastside cities don't have any bus lanes on local streets, so during peak times, local buses are usually slow and unreliable. Seattle has some bus lanes, but it's very piecemeal, and the buses are unreliable there as well. Seattle buses are more frequent than Eastside buses, and usually much more crowded.\n\nIf I was you, I'd probably look into living in either Downtown Bellevue or Downtown Redmond, depending on where exactly I was working. Both places you will be able to do most errands by walking. I'd make sure my workplace was near a frequent bus route.

There are several different games for the Wii in this series. If you're not familiar with this style of game, basically you have a floor mat with four directional arrows on it, and you have to step on the arrows to match the beat of the music. If you like energetic J-pop, get a \"Hottest Party\" game, if you like American/European music more, get something from the later series (simply titled \"Dance Dance Revolution\" and \"Dance Dance Revolution II\"). There are also \"Dance Dance Revolution Disney Grooves\" (North America only) and \"Dance Dance Revolution Winx Club\" (Europe only), if you're into that. The mat can be found on Ebay for $20 or so including shipping, and plugs into a Gamecube port. For multiple players, you'll need a mat for each player.\n\nThe other series to check out is Active Life. This is a series of four games which use a mat that is similar to (but incompatible with) the DDR mat, also plugging into the Gamecube port. The mat is also $20 or so. It has the buttons laid out so that two players can play on the same mat. Rather than trying to match the beat of a song in these games, you're playing a series of minigames, some where you simply pump your feet as fast as possible, some where you have to get the right timing, etc. The games are really aimed at younger children, but if you're just trying to get some exercise, I think they're alright. Explorer is generally considered to be the best in the series, but if you're coming to the series as a grownup, Outdoor Challenge or Extreme Challenge might be better. I'd give Magical Carnival a miss.\n\nI might also mention: research (and my own experience!) has shown that diet is more important than exercise in losing and maintaining weight. The amount of calories you can burn through exercise - unless you are at it all day, every day - is rather small compared to the amount you can cut from your diet.

The pay is terrible, and the methodology is hopeless, so you probably won't even feel like your job is worthwhile. I met a lot of English teachers in Japan, and every last one of them hated it. But getting almost any other job will require a high level of ability with the Japanese language. And pretty much any job (well, except for unskilled jobs) will pay less in Japan than it will in the US. Otherwise, I'm personally of the opinion that it's a very nice place to live.\n\nI've been learning Japanese on and off for over a decade. Learning this language is tough. Living in Japan doesn't actually make it any easier to learn, in my experience. You need to study, a lot. Starting from zero, getting to JLPT N1 (necessary but not sufficient for a lot of jobs) takes about 2-3 years, if you're studying full time. Best if you start now and commit to spending at least two, and preferably more, hours every single day studying. A lot of people slack on some part of the language (used to be kanji, but lately SRS has made that easier so now it's usually listening/speaking), but you need to work on all of it. Speaking of which - learn how to use an SRS like Anki or Mnemosyne.\n\nAnyway, I would really recommend not teaching English at all. If you want to go that route, South Korea and Taiwan have similar cultures, similar standards of living, and pay English teachers better, especially compared to the cost of living. And, if you're majoring in English and sociology, I don't know if you're going to be qualified for anything else.\n\nMaybe look into grad school - many Japanese universities have programs for foreign students which don't require much (if any) Japanese language proficiency, which are not terribly hard to get into, and there's a special government scholarship program for foreigners. One other option you might consider is going to a Japanese language school for a couple years after college. This is a bit pricey, though, and there are no loans available for it. But a student visa will allow you to work part-time, with certain restrictions.\n\nOn the other hand, if you only want to stay for a short time, JET is fine. It's just not the start of a rewarding career, is all.\n\nAbout racism... If you are white, Japan is one of the few places in the world where your race actually works against you sometimes. If you are East Asian, people will look down on you for either not speaking Japanese well, or just having a foreign accent. There's some anti-Korean and anti-Chinese sentiment. If you're black or you look like you're from Southeast Asia, that will tend to work against you too. And racism is totally legal in Japan. Landlords are not shy about saying they don't want foreigners for tenants. Though the Tokyo area is considerably less racist than the rest of Japan, even Kansai.\n\nSexism. It's nothing like Saudi Arabia of course, but feminism is basically unknown in Japan. Women are often expected to quit their jobs when they get pregnant, which is expected after they get married. Single mothers are almost unheard of (nearly 100% of out-of-wedlock pregnancies result in abortion), and childcare is very hard to find, because working women are looked down on. So... many employers are unwilling to hire women, because they'll expect that as soon as you get married, you'll get pregnant and quit. Sexual harassment and sexual assault are more common than in the US. If you are looking for a non-English teaching job, you might want to focus your search on foreign companies for all these reasons.\n\nOne thing that I'm going to mention, since you're female: men are short in Japan.  I noticed that most of the white men were shorter than average... but not in Japan, which I think might be part of the reason they were there. And foreign women in Japan generally either learned to accept that men that were shorter than they were, or, as most of them did, eventually left.\n\nOn the other hand, if you're into women, that shouldn't be a huge problem. Japanese people are largely irreligious, and there isn't much discrimination in that area, although marriage is still not allowed.", "created_utc": "1610359035.0", "edited": "False", "id": "giv193u", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_kuwkdo", "parent_id": "t3_kuwkdo", "score": "0", "subreddit": "IWantOut", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r5hw"}, {"author": "DrCharlesTinglePhD", "body": "I agree with you and I wish the powers that be would take this a bit more seriously. But maybe I can offer a little perspective.\n\nI moved back here from Philadelphia last year. As far as crime goes, Seattle actually is in pretty good shape, believe it or not. It's standard practice in many parts of Philadelphia to never store anything in your car, and always leave the car unlocked so thieves won't break the windows. And of course, shootings, assaults, muggings, home invasions, and burglaries are an everyday occurrence in most parts of Philadelphia. Not that they happen to everyone on a daily basis (none of them ever happened to me in Philadelphia, and actually most of them have happened to me in Seattle), but for most people they generally happen in their neighborhood on a daily basis. In Seattle all these things are comparatively rare.\n\nThere are two things that are less optimal in Seattle, though. One is that in Seattle, the main drug market is right in the middle of downtown, right next to the most prominent retail area, and literally right next to the most important transit connection point. In Philadelphia, the main drug market (probably the biggest in the US) is easily accessible if you really want to go there, but if you aren't interested, you'll never come across it.\n\nThe other less optimal thing is that while housing is very cheap in Philadelphia, it's gotten to be somewhat expensive in Seattle. Homelessness is consequently a lot worse here. In Philadelphia, it's reasonably common for people to invest in a vacant house for $20k or so (and then work hard at preventing people from squatting in it). Here, we're long past the point where most anyone with a steady job could afford a house, and really, there is nothing we can do about that in particular; there's only so much land.\n\nSingle-family housing aside, we haven't really kept up with apartment construction. The zoning here, while not nearly as bad as in California, is still too strict, and we should be spending much more on subsidized housing (keeping in mind that merely allocating more money for housing subsidies without making it easier to build housing is not going to work!). And I know it seems like Seattle is building tons of housing, and we are compared to most US cities, but it's still a lot less than it could be.\n\nBuilding more housing is really the only thing we can do about the homeless camps. We can't deport the homeless; very few of them are immigrants. We could try to lock them all up, but that's really just another form of (more expensive!) housing.\n\nWhat to do about the crime is a more difficult problem. Personally, I think we need more police. Seattle has far fewer police per capita than other cities of its size, and I think that lately this is really crippling their ability to do a good job. Unfortunately these days, due to ongoing problems with racism and rampant unprofessionalism, police have lost a lot of their credibility, so hiring more police is going to have to wait until we solve those problems.\n\nOne thing we should consider is - seriously - providing free heroin to addicts. Most of the problems caused by drug use are caused by 1) addicts doing whatever they have to to feed their habit, 2) dealers doing whatever they have to to protect their business, and 3) the variable quality of the heroin causing all sorts of health problems. Provide quality heroin for free and most of the problems go away.\n\nUnfortunately all these policies, besides being unpopular, would cost money, and our backward constitution prohibits the obvious ways to raise more tax revenue. On top of that, revenue is in the toilet due to the coronavirus recession. But it could be worse! Thanks to Amazon, Microsoft, et al, our economy is more solid than most, and we're doing better than most other cities.", "created_utc": "1601583577.0", "edited": "False", "id": "g7brbnb", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_j3esfc", "parent_id": "t3_j3esfc", "score": "3", "subreddit": "Seattle", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhad"}, {"author": "DrCharlesTinglePhD", "body": "What's the name of the school?

It took her until 3rd grade before her English (especially reading and writing) was really at grade level. Her Cambodian is stagnating, despite the best efforts of her mother (who taught Cambodian history at a junior high school). She can't read or write Cambodian, and well, she just has no interest. She wants to start learning Spanish, actually, because she has some friends from school that know it.\n\nThe younger child, now 4, doesn't speak any Cambodian at all. Her mother tries to teach her some phrases, like \"Hello\", \"Good-bye\", etc. but she's not into it. Her English ability is far above what her sister's ability was at this age.\n\nSo... their mother tries to do this same thing where she will refuse to use English with our children, but honestly I don't see how it can work. I think it takes more than conversations with your parents to really be any good at a language. Cambodian-American kids all speak English, so even back when we were living in a Cambodian neighborhood, they got no practice speaking with other kids, only with (some) adults.\n\nCambodian television is terrible. Cambodian books are very few in number. If there are any video games at all in Cambodian, I'm unaware of them. So all the media my kids consume is in English (the younger one is not averse to watching stuff in other languages sometimes, but it's never Cambodian). I suppose this problem is not nearly so bad in Spanish or German, and this is subjective, but still, I expect that your child will gravitate toward English-language media as well.\n\nSo... I believe that if you want your child to learn three languages, well... I have found it hard enough to get my oldest kid to learn English to a decent level.

There are a lot of things to memorize: the pronunciation, writing system, vocabulary, and grammar are all different. Spanish is much easier: the pronunciation has a lot more overlap with English, the writing system is nearly the same, due to the Norman invasion of England the vocabulary has a lot of overlap, and the grammar is much closer to English than Japanese is. It usually takes at least two years, and usually more like four, five, or even longer, for most people to reach a high level of proficiency with Japanese. Spanish is easy: it can be learned in a year.\n\nBut on the other hand, there is more reward for knowing Japanese. Not to put too fine a point on this, but while many more people speak Spanish, most of them are poor and uneducated. Japan is one of the richest places on Earth, with an extremely high literacy level. They are obviously well-known for their cartoons, video games, and comic books. But just in general, Japanese people read a lot: the highest-circulation newspaper in the world is Japanese, and their book publishing industry is one of the world's largest, with a centuries-long history of literature (they literally invented the novel).\n\nAnd since it is so hard to learn Japanese, a lot of Japanese stuff doesn't get translated into English. There are many millions of people who know both English and Spanish, so I would bet most of the good stuff in Spanish gets translated to English. In a way, the fact that Japanese is hard just makes it that much more worthwhile to learn.\n\nNow personally, before I started learning Japanese, my work ethic when it came to studying was essentially zero. I was the kind of person who routinely got near-perfect scores on tests in school without any studying at all, so I never needed to do it, and didn't even know how to. My Japanese is still honestly kind of bad, but I've actually learned how to deliberately memorize large amounts of information and I've become disciplined enough to do it on consistent basis. I feel like if I tried to learn e.g. Spanish or French, I could have blundered around and achieved fluency without even trying very hard, as many people seem to do.\n\nSo I would say: go for it.

There have been a couple more standards since then, C++14 and C++17, but they weren't such big changes.\n\nThe most helpful resources for me so far have been Bjarne Stroustrup's The C++ Programming Language, and Scott Meyers's Effective C++ (third edition, and maybe the second too, if you're a completionist) and Effective Modern C++. (\"Modern C++\" is what people often say to talk about C++ after C++11.) The \"Effective\" books cover a lot of dark corners in the language that people tend to get wrong, and C++ easily has more dark corners than any other language. People often recommend Stroustrup's A Tour of C++, but I found that it skips over a lot of essential detail.\n\nMake sure to look through the standard library reference. Most languages have little more than standard algorithms, data structures, and system interfaces in their standard library, but C++ has a lot of things that are basically language features in the standard library (and strangely, not covered in any C++ \"language manual\" that I could find).", "created_utc": "1598399169.0", "edited": "False", "id": "g2uuuzg", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_igcdoo", "parent_id": "t3_igcdoo", "score": "3", "subreddit": "Cplusplus", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh6x"}, {"author": "DrCharlesTinglePhD", "body": "This is not the most important thing in the world, really - back when most people learned using romaji, typical accents used to be a lot worse.\n\nAnyway, you just need lots of practice.

My primary concern about Seattle is the shitty transit, with a secondary concern being the shitty conditions for walking and biking. I don't really care about anything else. My list would be:\n\n1. McGinn - good ideas about transportation\n2. Nickels - sometimes good ideas about transportation\n3. Schell - in over his head, but not actually evil\n4. Murray, Durkan - bad ideas about transportation\n\nMcGinn had his priorities straight on transportation and zoning, which no other mayor did. I will admit he was ineffective in executing the job, although the biggest problem he had was that almost everyone else in Seattle politics hated his priorities.\n\nThere were two things that Nickels screwed up. First was the idiotic highway tunnel. It is incomprehensible to me how any self-professed environmentalist could support spending that much money on infrastructure for cars. But that is American environmentalism for you - the environment is important, but not as important as being able to drive whereever you want. It was really a bit much that he had just killed the monorail for being too expensive.\n\nThe second thing that Nickels screwed up was the redevelopment of Cascade - oh sorry, we call it South Lake Union now. There there was no preexisting infrastructure to handle the influx of jobs, and a stupid mixed-traffic streetcar was never going to solve it. Nothing is ever really going to solve it, because it's between downtown and a lake, so it will never be on the way to anything else.\n\nSodo, which is actually now served by a shiny new light rail line, should have been redeveloped instead. But people are nostalgic for manufacturing jobs, and manufacturing jobs used to be there. So we can't possibly redevelop all the low-density warehouses and retail there (the manufacturing is all but gone), right next to the highest capacity transit corridor in the city. But I digress.\n\nTo be honest, what I mostly remember about Schell was that some insane \"activist\" hit him in the head with a bullhorn. He was kind of wishy-washy on light rail. Considering how shitty it turned out, that was kind of justified.\n\nMurray was basically the mayor that Seattle wants: totally in tune with the Seattle pro-car consensus (while willing to spend money on ineffective transit to appease our conscience), and also gay. But then he had some kind of personal scandal. I can't even remember the details, except that it was unproven.\n\nDurkan is pro-car and gay, so on paper she should be popular.

But it doesn't usually work out that way. Visiting New York is a big hassle. Although you can make a day trip without staying overnight, which you can't really do from, say, DC or Boston.\n\nOne big warning I will give you, as a programmer myself, the job market is not good here. Probably worse than Denver. Most of the jobs are in the suburbs. I am contacted by recruiters all the time for jobs in King Prussia, Wilmington, Cherry Hill, New York, everywhere but Philadelphia itself. Even after putting \"I will not accept any position outside Center City Philadelphia\" at the top of my resume. I do exclusively remote work now, because it pays better than anything here.\n\nIf you can handle the crowds (my wife cannot) and the cost of living, New York just has a higher quality of life in general. Better transit, more walkability, less litter, less violence. People in New York are better about following the rules and not being an asshole.\n\nThe primary advantage Philadelphia has over New York is that housing is very cheap here. You can rent an entire 3-bedroom house here for the cost of a studio apartment there. Also, compared to New York, there are virtually no tourists.
