I read a fair bit on this a couple years ago because depersonalization describes so well an experience I've had since childhood (though not frequently enough to qualify as a mental disorder). In my understanding, derealization is about feeling your environment and the world isn't real, and depersonalization is about feeling you aren't real - and most of the time these co-occur (though I've only experienced the latter). I've heard many descriptions of both and depersonalization is usually described as being separated from your body and whatever it is doing, as if you're a different entity observing the world through this physical thing, without being that physical thing itself. It doesn't necessarily have anything to do with masking, playing a role, or lying to anyone. I think what you described in your comment sounds like an experience that most people have, not necessarily connected to whatever disorder you might have. If you actually think you might have DDD, you should probably talk to someone and get a diagnosis so it can be treated.

If you want to learn lucid dreaming, dream journaling and reality checks are a good place to start. Writing down your dreams first thing each morning helps you start remembering them more clearly, and helps you notice any interesting patterns. Reality checks are little things you do throughout the day to find out if you're dreaming. The one that works best for me is counting my fingers, for some reason, but there are plenty of other ones you can do. For example, you could look at a clock and see if the time makes sense and is moving at a normal speed. Or you could just check out your surroundings and question if everything around you makes sense and is possible in real life. Do your RC a few times a day, or whenever you see something strange. Make it a habit and eventually you're going to start doing it in your dreams too. These are the two most important things imo, and they're easy to start with.

Atheism and Christianity aren't the only possibilities. \n\nAtheism has no such rules, since it isn't a religion. It has no rules. It doesn't prevent anyone from exploring. I have always been an atheist, but I enjoy learning about different religions and looking at things from a different point of view. I especially like Paganism and Buddhism. At no point did atheism tell me \"no, you can't do that, you can't learn about these gods\". \n\nI wouldn't say disbelief is objectively preferable. Neither is belief. It's completely up to the person. To me, disbelief is preferable, because I simply don't think there is a god and I don't need one either. I don't need proof because it is impossible to prove that something doesn't exist. I could tell you I believe in unicorns and there would be no way to prove me wrong. That's why there will never be a way to prove god doesn't exist. I have no reason to believe in a god, so I don't, and I'm perfectly content with that. Someone else might prefer believing, for whatever reason, and I see no issue with that. You do what you want, and as long as you're not doing anything harmful, I respect that.", "created_utc": "1655988065.0", "edited": "False", "id": "idf9v0k", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_vikxum", "parent_id": "t1_idetjd8", "score": "2", "subreddit": "satanism", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qqve"}, {"author": "_peikko_", "body": "I was raised Christian.

I'm neither a Christian or a Satanist, so I don't really have a horse in this. \n\nSaying that atheists are going to hell will not bother atheists directly, but it is the reason why religious people keep annoying us about it. It also prevents religious people from exploring other ideas, because they aren't allowed to question it. That contradicts the 5th tenet of TST. I also think trying to convert people to Satanism is stupid. You can educate them about it, sure, but if you're actually trying to make them satanists, that is a big nope. I don't see why any religion needs to do that. Satanism is an individual thing. I believe atheism is the truth, but I've never tried to make anyone an atheist. \n\nA story that's often brought up is the one about Adam and Eve in the beginning. I'm sure you in what I mean. By not letting them eat the fruit, God is against both truth and freedom, despite saying he's not. Actions matter more than words. \n\nCompassion and love is at the core of nearly every religion in the world. That doesn't make anyone Christian.

It is definitely the better option if you're going for historical accuracy, and probably what most people here would recommend, but it's your choice in the end, so use whichever you like!

There are multiple meanings to the word ego. To my understanding, in Buddhism, for example, you don't consider the ego to be you. Viewing the ego as the only you limits your view of what actually is you, and what you are deep down. If you think you are your ego, your life will be more difficult, because your ego always wants things, and desire is ultimately the source of most, if not all suffering. Now, if you are able to detach from your ego, you will feel much more present and connected to everything, and be able to see things as they really are. Only by forgetting what you think you are can you understand what you really are. This is not science. It's philosophy, and maybe to some extent, religion. \n\nI don't actually know much about Buddhism. I'm just your ordinary European metalhead.
