This is known as the [critical theory hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_period_hypothesis). However there are many independent studies and experiments that rebut this theory. As someone who is past this age myself, I am also a big skeptic of this theory. In fact, I believe that the more experienced with studying in general you are the more efficiently you can learn a new language.\n\nYoung kids can easily pick up a new language because they are put in situations in which mostly basic words with short sentences are spoken around them, which facilitates them to pick up words and structures of a language through constant exposure only. Teens or adults however cannot be put into such situations as we live in rather professional settings. Words of low frequency and long & complex sentences are used everywhere, which makes it difficult to naturally pick up a new language through exposure only. More importantly, at this stage, unlike children we are already equipped with a fluent mother tongue, which forces us to learn a new language through the medium of textbooks and classes written and conducted in our mother tongue.\n\nMany studies have proved that adults preform far better than kids when they are taught a new language with this method thanks to years of studying experiences in high school and college. In this case, we take the general path of learning a new language through classes and books. This method can be used by young and senior adults alike.\n\nHowever, considering the difference in lifestyle between seniors and young adults, seniors might want to take a look into these differences.\n\nLanguage learning requires the learner to be constantly exposed to the target language. The **internet** is the most ideal medium for this effort. People can read articles, watch videos or TV shows of foreign media outlets with the help of the internet. We can also communicate with native speakers of our target languages through the internet. Considering the fact that senior adults might not be very familiar with these platforms, they can try reaching out for help to young people to introduce themselves to these websites or apps such as YouTube, Tandem or Discord. On the other hand, if utilizing the internet is not an ideal option, they can also look for community services or social clubs which help them with classes or language exchanges.\n\nApart from these specific advice for senior adults, everyone can ask for general advice for language learning on this subreddit, in which many users would be happy to reach out and help.\n\nedit: typo and a few words", "created_utc": "1663596996.0", "edited": "1663599102.0", "id": "ip2evb3", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_xicpqi", "parent_id": "t3_xicpqi", "score": "155", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "Hedgehog-Moist", "body": "I have never used materials that solely target enhancing speaking skills, since ordinary textbooks did the job for me.
