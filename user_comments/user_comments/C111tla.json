I wouldn't put him in my Top 20 best players of all time, perhaps, but it's hard to argue against him being an all-time great. I am fairly certain I am still going to remember his name 60 years from now, assuming I am still alive and don't get Alzeheimer's.

One of the major ones is that the CGI has simply not aged very well. It looks like a video game at times. Overall, it's certainly aged better than with some other films of the era, but it does stand out. Secondly, the films are, in many ways, not faithful to the books.\n\nI would have liked to see someone like Stanley Kubrick or David Lean direct the Lord if the Rings. Imagine that. LotR as an epic like 2001 or Lawrence of Arabia. Shot and projected on 70mm, no CGI. Faithful to the novels. Wouldn't this have been glorious?\n\nI have recently been discovering David Lean's works. First the Bridge on the River Kwai, then Lawrence of Arabia, then Zhivago. Imagine if he could have directed LotR! My gosh, that would have been something to behold.
