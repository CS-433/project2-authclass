To think that you can learn a language essentially \"for free\" or without effort the same way you acquired your native language is very tempting, similar to buying expensive exercise equipment because it seems to give you pre-paved road directly to getting ripped, ignoring the fact that a strict diet and intense commitment is required to make that exercise equipment work. However, the misunderstanding of immersion is even more insidious than Bowflex, because at least the layman understands they need to work out hard and frequently to get in shape, but the person who hears they can learn Japanese like their native language might not even register how much effort it is.\n\nYou say it's a strawman, but to me it's very rare for someone to suggest immersion with the explicit warning attached that you *must* learn from some sort of traditional source to build up enough of a base for it to be effective. Now, that may not seem a fair standard because let's say I suggest someone use Genki to start learning, I wouldn't want to be accused of misleading someone because that's the same as telling them to use *nothing but* Genki, right?\n\nAnd yeah I agree it's not a fair standard to try to hold people to who are just trying to help, but nonetheless this exact problem had already been happening for years with textbooks. Tt's why \"Learn without those stuffy textbooks!\" became a huge selling point of literally every advertised language learning tool and method. The cultural knowledge simply corrected and pushed for a solution for the person who spends a year with their nose in textbooks and never learns the real language. Now that solution has become widespread and misinterpreted, and you're seeing a pushback against the misinterpretation to help the similarly unfortunate person who tries to listen to Japanese for hours daily for a year hoping it will \"sink in\" and never learns the language either.\n\nIt's certainly reaching a point where there's some *over-correction*, which is what you're accurately criticizing in your post.

Are you trying to say with this example that when you call piracy stealing, you mean the pirates are copying the idea of the game and not giving credit?\n\nAnd before you laser-focus on the word \"copy\", do note that there are two meanings or at least connotations of copy - to reproduce an idea from another place, and to duplicate data. To prove this, consider the phrase \"I copied the file to another hard drive.\" This clearly doesn't mean \"I took the idea of the file without crediting the person who created it\". The action under the microscope is not taking ideas without permission (like joke theft), it's the moral harm of duplicating data you don't have permission to duplicate (piracy).\n\nPeople tend to think joke theft and idea theft is bad because someone is profiting off of someone else's work by receiving money or accolades - if Amy Schumer is stealing jokes, then she's not sharing them with others for free, she's making money off of telling them in clubs and on specials.\n\nI think anyone who is soft on piracy would be more judgmental if a scene group was for example charging access to pirated copies by running their own storefront where people bought the pirated games at a discount. I know that does happen, but that's more of a situation in 3rd world countries with bootleggers selling USBs of pirated games because the games are not released there or wages are so low as to make any game unaffordable.

The first time through the reading was much slower, but then I went through the vocab and grammar and analyzed pieces of the text I didn't understand. To cap it off I'd listen to it with the audio one last time.\n\nDay 2-3 of a new chapter: I listened to the audio for the readings again, then wrote the answers to all the reading-based questions in a notebook. Then I went back and read the readings out loud to myself once or twice, attempting to get my reading speed and speaking to a natural, confident speed.\n\nDay 3-4 of a new chapter: I listened to the audio for the readings again, then read them out loud myself again. Sometimes I would also review the example sentences from the grammar section and read those out loud. Then I would do the speaking activities either by speaking to myself, or I would write them out as dialogues and have them corrected by my tutor.\n\nDay 4-8: More re-reading and reading aloud, and I would start putting any words into anki that I either was not retaining from this daily practice, or any words with new kanji or kanji readings. During this time I would be doing the practice questions in the grammar exercises book and writing them down in my notebook or just saying them out loud. I would also have a meeting with my tutor once a week and around this time I would sometimes ask him to do the speaking/conversation exercises again with me so I could do them properly.\n\nDay 9-10: I would do writing activities for the chapter in the grammar book and send those to my tutor for corrections. (So we ended up alternating 1 week writing corrections and discussion on writing natural Japanese, and 1 week conversation practice).\n\nDay 11-ish: By this time I was about done with the chapter, but I would read the passages aloud again, this time challenging myself to keep the same pace as the book audio.

Is this a key word in one of my hobbies/some topic I'd want to talk or read about on a regular basis?\n3. Is this the sort of word or phrase I needed before when speaking but I didn't know it at the time?\n4. Have I seen this same word more than 3-4 times in the past month without having made a card for it yet, and I still had to look it up?\n\nIf I could answer yes to one of those, it was an automatic add.

If I forget, I forget, I'll see it again.\n\nWhen I got tired of struggling to understand every sentence, I would take a break from any immersion for a week and go back to exclusive learning from my textbook (Genki) which required much less effort to learn from, even if it wasn't quite as \"real\". Then I'd switch back to using the textbook less and start butting my head up against real Japanese again...\n\nRepeating this process over months and years simply led to me seeing everything I need to get by reading most everyday material so many times it's trivial at this point. I went back recently and looked at the notebook I kept with pages of words from Pokemon Gold in Japanese. I remember sweating as I carefully wrote all the kanji and definitions, swearing I'd never be able to remember all this in a million years. Except now I look down the list and all the words are easy... even \"hard\" words like \u56f3\u9451 are obvious in both meaning and reading by looking at the kanji.

As I understand it colloquially, literacy describes simply the ability to read words and numbers, while functional literacy is the ability to apply this skill in every day life. The NCES classifies literacy into 4 categories:\n\n* Below Basic - This runs the gamut from \"doesn't know the alphabet\" to \"can read some words\", and represents 14% of American adults.  \n* Basic - This means someone capable of reading signs and labels to the point they can function in everyday life, and understand enough of small texts to extract basic ideas and information. 29% fall into this category.  \n* Intermediate - This means someone who is able to digest basic prose and draw conclusions from, summarize, and otherwise meaningfully analyze the contents. 44% fall into this category.  \n* Proficient - This is someone who can do all the things the Intermediate level can, but while analyzing more dense and complex texts. 13% fall into this category.\n\nIf that data seems old, I'll note the link above shows the average scale score out of 500 for their literacy assessment in 2003 was 275 in Prose. [In 2017 that scale score was 271](https://nces.ed.gov/surveys/piaac/current_results.asp), so not a big change, and I would expect the categorical breakdown would remain much the same.\n\nThe following is a recreation of the kinds of questions I remember seeing on state-issued English proficiency tests I took in 4th or 5th grade.\n\n> Mary had always wanted a pet. She begged her parents for a puppy every chance she got, but her parents would not let her have one. They said it was much too hard to take care of a pet. Still, Mary kept asking for a pet puppy, because she wanted one very badly. Then one day, Mary's parents came home and brought with them a box full of holes, and the name of a pet store stamped on the side. Mary smiled as wide as could be. But she stopped smiling, and began to frown when her parents opened the box and it let out a meow. \"Say hello to Mr. Whiskers!\" her parents said.\n\nWhy did Mary stop smiling?  \nA) Her parents opened the box with her new pet  \nB) She wanted a puppy, but her parents got her a cat  \nC) She realized a pet would be too hard to take care of after all  \nD) She hates cats  \n\nWhat I'm about to describe is anecdotal based on real people I've met and interacted with in not just online, but in real life - this may seem very strawmannish (inventing dumb people to then knock down) if you haven't known people like this, but hopefully this rings true and not too apocryphal for many of you.\n\nThere are people that will swear to their dying day, for various reasons, that A, C, or D are the correct answer, and can even fully justify themselves.\n\n**The A-Answerer** will argue something like, opening the box would have let Mary see the cat before hearing the meow, so really it was opening the box that made her smile turn to a frown.

This person does not know how to extract likely cause and effect from a text when it is not stated in extremely explicit terms.\n\n**The C-Answerer** will cite the sentence where the parents said it would be too hard to take care of a pet. When it's pointed out there's more evidence for Mary wanting a puppy, they'll argue maybe both B and C are right, or that the story makes no sense because first the parents said it was too hard to take care of a pet, then got Mary a pet anyway with no explanation. This person cannot determine what written details are relevant, nor understand the intent of a passage of text.\n\n**The D-Answerer** might justify themselves by the fact that puppies and cats are both fine pets, and even if she wants a puppy more, for Mary to be sad about getting such a nice and cuddly gift from her parents, she must hate cats, and there is simply no other explanation. This person is unable to put themselves in the shoes of someone who appears in a text, and instead fills those shoes with their own biases (to use the local jargon, typical-minding).\n\nI've long since given up internet debates, but I see these archetypes appear again and again as arguments explode across comment sections. It's easy to commit the fallacy of thinking just because someone is reading what you wrote and responding to it, that they actually understood the content. Someone who is functionally illiterate would not be filtered by a website like reddit, which has no more barrier to entry in literacy terms than the local supermarket.\n\nNext time someone answers a comment in a way that makes you think \"Are they intentionally misinterpreting what I said?\", consider framing your comment as a 5th grade literacy test question. Did they fail the test? And I don't even mean it as a signal to demean or dismiss the person either - surely you'd react differently to someone who could not correctly answer the question about Mary above. This framing has helped me, so maybe it can help you too, to better choose when and whether to engage, and to respectfully \"meet people where they are\".", "created_utc": "1629127853.0", "edited": "1629128068.0", "id": "h961pgf", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_p5acum", "parent_id": "t3_p5acum", "score": "173", "subreddit": "TheMotte", "subreddit_id": "t5_vkedk"}, {"author": "edlolington", "body": "For a more full translation of what he said (very hard to translate this way of speaking into natural English, keep in mind) it would be:\n\n > I get the same thing out of playing Goldlewis as I did Zato, but instead of drip feeding me fun, behemoth typhoon drowns me in it\n\nLiterally, he's saying, \"While feeling what is expected from Zato, I'm drowning in the enjoyment of the behemoth (typhoon)\"", "created_utc": "1628868655.0", "edited": "False", "id": "h8sk08u", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_p3ktum", "parent_id": "t3_p3ktum", "score": "19", "subreddit": "Guiltygear", "subreddit_id": "t5_2tiga"}, {"author": "edlolington", "body": "I seem to remember learning an adverb that I now can't remember for the life of me.

This turned into a long answer so the tl;dr is at the bottom.\n\nYou probably can't tell since you're just starting, but a lot of grammar questions that are posted here are absolute, barebones basics that are explained in about 1-2 sentences in the first few chapters of any beginner learner's resource (be it a textbook or any other grammar study material).\n\nThey'll say something like, \"I was reading a manga and saw [\u9ad8](#fg \"\u305f\u304b\")\u304f\u306a\u3044 (not expensive) but I don't understand why it's not [\u9ad8](#fg \"\u305f\u304b\")\u3044\u3058\u3083\u306a\u3044?\" You'll have to take my word for it but this question is so fundamentally basic that the chance someone asking that kind of question is understanding even 1% of what they're reading in that manga is basically 0. It's like someone learning English reading Lord of the Rings and asking \"The character said 'I have seen Minas Tirith', but why are there two verbs 'have' and 'seen' right next to each other?\"\n\nPeople who recommend early immersion are probably coming from Matt vs. Japan, a youtuber who's a major public face of an early immersion approach, but what they sometimes leave unclear (and which Matt left out until he amended his opinion awhile back) is that you need to spend a few months working on basic grammar before you are equipped to learn *anything* from immersion. Matt started the immersion approach after taking Japanese classes for a few years and then going on a homestay program in Japan, realizing he couldn't speak Japanese despite studying it for awhile, and getting depressed. He later tried the immersion approach and it worked wonders - by listening and imitating he could learn and speak. The reason this worked for him is because he literally spent years being taught grammar concepts and basic vocab that gave him a base to work off of - someone starting from 0 cannot make immersion work for them in that way, with the efficiency someone who combines immersion with traditional resources can.\n\nIMO a better path is this - you should be working on a balance between immersion and grammar/textook/textbook-like resources (Tae-kim for example). Week 1, you are at 1% immersion, 99% textbook. Then you gradually ramp that up as you learn. Maybe after a year you're at 50/50, after 3 years you're at 99% immersion and 1% references (for looking up vocab you can't figure out from context, rare grammar forms, set phrases, etc.) This ramp-up can happen as fast or slow as you're mastering the fundamentals, and retaining what you've learned so don't think 50/50 after a year is a roadmap or anything - you might go faster or slower. One thing I do appreciate about the aggressive immersion people, and I think you should take to heart, is to always attack native material you feel is slightly out of your grasp, and don't be afraid to feel lost. It's like exercising - you gain muscle when you push yourself a little further than you're comfortable with.\n\ntl;dr - If you only do immersion early, or go too heavily into it, you're missing out on the benefits of having concepts explained to you like a grammar guide or textbook will do.

An indirect object is acted upon by the verb using a connector.\n\nEx 1: I walk to the store.

There are no Anki setup instructions, but there are three Google Drive links to the versions of the addon compatible with different Anki versions and a \"legacy user's guide\". I hold off for now on downloading the old guide, expecting some incorrect screenshots/instructions might just distract me and hoping the process is straightforward enough. There are no instructions on installing the local Anki add-on, but thankfully I already know how to do this.\n\nAfter installing, Anki gives me a warning that there is no Migaku dictionary set. It tells me I should refer to the user guide in the settings for instructions. When I go there, it tells me the user guide has been removed due to being outdated. I go into the other settings and there is nowhere to a set up a \"dictionary\" in any of the options, but there is a line called \"Browser Downloads\" which lets me choose a \"directory\". That's the closest thing to what I expected, so I click it. It wants me to pick a directory, not a dictionary file. No idea what to do and the Patreon page says nothing on this, so time to return to the \"legacy\" instructions.\n\nThe instructions are a browser page you download and open locally. The table of contents at the top does not use relative URLs, so when I click them it takes me off the local help page and to massimmersionapproach.com. The page looks the same but I figure I'm probably safer referencing exactly what was linked to on the Patreon post, so I hit back and start scrolling to the Dictionaries section. On the way, I see completely different installation instructions for the add-on, using an addon code to download from the internet. Maybe this is the proper path. I go to uninstall the extension, it can't uninstall unless you restart Anki in safe mode. So I do, uninstall, try the download code - oops, of course, it's a broken, outdated version. It's the legacy manual, after all. I reinstall from the local addon file and decide to ignore anything that isn't about getting the dictionary set up.\n\nI'm given a link to a Mega folder and told to download the *entire* folder for my target language. The Japanese folder has several subfolders with German, French, etc. dictionaries, but I download the whole thing anyway. It turns out a single file is corrupt, and the .zip download from Mega fails at 99%. I have Mega download them all individually at once. This works, and when one file fails I can identify which one is corrupt - the English term_bank_10.json. Chrome puts the rest of the file in one folder without any structure, so all the languages are mixed together. I reference the Mega folder and manually remake all the folders and move all the files. I try to redownload the file, no dice. I try to preview the file in the browser and copy the text locally, but it fails in multiple browsers on multiple machines (all other files are previewable). So I make a blank term_bank_10.json and place all the files where the manual tells me (the path is wrong, but I figure it out anyway)\n\nI restart Anki as per the instructions. It starts to load all the dictionaries. When I gets to English, it crashes. I'm a software engineer so looking at the error I can immediately tell it crashed because it wasn't expecting a json file with 0 bytes. I delete the empty file and reload, and thankfully it doesn't crash, and no longer complains the dictionary is missing. I try the dictionary search inside Anki, the shortcuts are great and I can set the font up to my favorite one, excellent. I get results for Dutch, French, Bulgarian... no English. Bummer. The manual says if the folder structure changes, it will reload the dictionaries, but I deleted that file and nothing changed. Maybe I can get it to reload them by deleting the database file it made. No, that causes it to crash on startup. Safe mode, uninstall, reinstall. Reloads the dictionaries, including English, now it works. I'm just missing some 900kb of definitions somewhere but at least it's a start.\n\nBack to the Patreon page to set up the browser extension. I minimize the dictionary window and Anki hard crashes... We'll have to address that later. For the extension, there's a Google Drive link and instructions for upgrading an existing installation, but not installing from scratch. Thankfully I know how to set up local Chrome extensions already so I hope that's good enough. I get it installed, and start exploring the settings. \"Import Words from Anki\" - I like looking at all the words I know, so let's start there. I export a .apkg file form Anki, and click the import button. It wants a \".anki2\" file. I go back to the export settings in Anki, and there's no option to export as .anki2. I search through my Anki user data - no .anki2 file. I make a note to look that up later since I guess I'm a little more ignorant on Anki than I thought. Again, the addon's menus and the Patreon page provide no help.\n\nI do see two more links on Patreon though - a Mediafire link to download \"The Audio for the Extension\" (pronunciation files I guess?) Over 600mb of audio and no instructions on what to do with it. I hunt through the legacy instructions and they say to put the audio in the folder with the add-on. Fair enough. Next is \"Windows ffmpeg installation\". No explanation again, just a Google Drive link and a Youtube video. Thankfully I know what ffmpeg is and what it's for; I already have ffmpeg installed and in my system path meaning any application should be able to see it. I ignore this for now but make a note to come back to it if something seems broken.\n\nSo let's test this out on Youtube. I turn on the toolbar and I get some beautifully formatted subtitles - neat! I try to export a subtitle to Anki, and it says I need to enable \"Allow Recording\". I didn't do that at first because I thought it was optional to capture audio but apparently you must capture audio with every card. Maybe there's a way to turn that off, but I'll enable it for now. I try again, nothing happens. I go back to Anki and notice a warning has popped up below the browser window, saying I don't have a dictionary set... But this time it tells me that I need to pick the folder in that Browser Downloads setting from earlier. The same folder that the addon automatically loaded the dictionaries from when it started up? I put it in and try to export a card again. Nothing happens.\n\nI restart Anki, the browser, and try again. It plays the video through the subtitle and stops after, just like the video in the OP demoed. I assume this worked, but still nothing. There must be some settings still wrong.\n\nWhat's this \"Export 1T\" button? I click it and it says \"Only Japanese subtitles that have already been parsed are valid for automatic 1T card creation. If you have Japanese selected please parse the text then try again\". There's a \"Parse\" button on the toolbar, so I click it. Nothing happens. I return to the Youtube video in the OP and he explains 1T is the \"one target\" button. From context I assume it means it finds sentences with one unknown word. That makes sense why it didn't work then - I couldn't import my known words after all. I would've never been able to figure that out from the error popup though.\n\nWhat about the in-browser player that can load your own subs? I get an anime I have on my SSD with subtitles. It's an .mkv, which the extension doesn't support, bummer. I have some .mp4s with subs too... except those are .ssa files, and the extension only supports .srt files.\n\nI return to the Patreon page hopeful for more guidance. On a whim I click on that ffmpeg Youtube video. It's a private video showing to drop ffmpeg into the Anki addon folder. So it was listed with the Chrome add-on instructions, but it was actually for the Anki add-on after all... So something is probably broken with that. He advises to follow the steps in the \"first guide that [he] put out\". I notice the ffmpeg video is private. I glance through his other videos for a guide that might've cleared all this up, but I just see his normal Youtube content. I assume that other guide is private as well and I need to hunt for it in some past Patreon post. I'm definitely not doing that at this point, so I uninstall everything and come here to write this post.\n\nIn summary, a lot of this is hard to directly blame on the creator - the corrupt file on Mega, my getting confused at a few points, etc. I'll even give him the benefit of the doubt and assume the addon is not straight up broken even though I couldn't get it to work. However, the whole process as you can see is basically fully jank - it's not well documented and it's not discoverable. The typical user is not going to want to hunt through a Discord and many Patreon posts to figure out how to set this up, which is where I would've had to go next if I didn't tap out when I did. I progressed through this because I'm more of a power user, with a decent amount of patience. I would expect the average person to tap out after the first Anki error. In the end, I hope he puts my $5 to good use and refines this into something more user friendly.

If I go back and read an article that I could only barely struggle through a month ago, I'm always surprised by how easy it seems now, even if I haven't been studying this text specifically. My Japanese can't have improved massively in one month, and yet just knowing a few more words and being more comfortable with a bit more grammar than before is enough to make it seem easy now.\n\nAnother example of this: before I started learning Japanese, I'd listen to foreigners on Youtube speaking Japanese and be amazed by how fluent and perfect they were. Now I can go back and fully understand many of them, and tell which ones really are fluent and which ones are actually close to the level I'm at now. Some of the best on Youtube like Dogen and Matt vs. Japan still feel impossibly above my level, but I know that'll only be true until I put in enough work to reach where they got.\n\nLooking back it may seem like grammar was wasted time because it wasn't much effort compared to the massive task of learning how to read Japanese, but it only seems that way because it's behind you now and you're good at it. If you had instead focused on kanji, you might make a similar post saying how you know all these words but you're not comfortable using them or understanding them in a Japanese sentence because of how daunting Japanese grammar is.

I ended up writing a bit too much I think but I wanted to get all my thoughts out there.\n\nAs for studying - there is certainly a limit to how long you can make meaningful progress in a day. This limit can change a lot in my experience, varying from person to person, and even from day to day. Some days I study for 15 minutes and I feel like I'm done. There have been a few weekend days where I get into [a flow state](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iUsOCR1KKms) and sit down for 6 hours doing nothing but studying and retaining all of it. And there are frustrating days where I feel extremely motivated but I know I'm not retaining what I'm looking at and shouldn't push it even if I want to.\n\nThe important thing I find is to break up what you're doing so you can maintain concentration for one, and also be introspective. In contrast to that \"flow state\", I think we've all had moments where we realize everything we're trying to remember is going in one ear and out the other within 30 seconds. In those moments, just let yourself take a break and get back to it later.\n\nIf you have those days where after 20 minutes you're just out of gas, don't sweat it or feel like because you have 5 hours of free time you should use all of it on Japanese. I think this is a cliched saying by now, but language learning is a marathon, not a sprint.", "created_utc": "1586224607.0", "edited": "False", "id": "fmnf2nk", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_fw2z4l", "parent_id": "t1_fmmxtko", "score": "3", "subreddit": "LearnJapanese", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qyls"}, {"author": "edlolington", "body": "I don't see anything wrong with making your own flashcards in Anki or something. In fact, you get \"free\" practice for the words by completing the Genki activities. It forces you to recall and produce the words, which will help you learn them better than just using flashcard-related activities. The reason I say this is because of what I'd like to discuss below -- I want to point out a pitfall you may be falling into that you should be careful of:\n\n> My focus right now is the reading aspect of japanese, then after I can read confidently, I can focus on the other parts. \n\nHere is a problem I can see with this and it may be why you're finding it difficult to pin down the right resource besides WaniKani - when learning a language you can't focus on \"just\" one thing and still learn efficiently. You can certainly have a focus on reading and vocabulary, but if you don't invest a lot of time in the other skills you will have a problem. This is because out of the \"Big 4\" of reading, writing, speaking, and listening, each single aspect feeds into all the others.\n\nWhen flashcards make up a significant portion of your studies, you are mastering the act of recognizing things on flashcards, and not mastering the words themselves. Think about it this way - if you use flashcards to study for a history test, and you read a question and can get the answer in 1 second, you can say you really have mastery of the material. Languages are way harder than this. Imagine you are reading a short sentence with 10 words. That sentence I wrote just had 10 words in it - did it take you 10 seconds to read it? Think of how long that is. The appropriate time to recall the majority of your vocabulary is approximately **0 seconds** if you want to read confidently. And I hope you understand all the grammar perfectly as well - otherwise it took you 10 seconds to get a list of words whose meaning together you don't understand. How to get your 1 second \"flashcard mastery\" down to 0 second \"language proficiency\"? This is what I mean by the 4 skills of languages \"feeding into each other\".\n\nIf you speak well, you can develop a better ear for how people talk and predict how sentences will be worded, speeding up accuracy when reading and listening.  \nIf you are good at listening, you will find it easier to reproduce Japanese when you speak and write, and you will have another axis to connect your reading knowledge to which will help you read faster and more naturally.  \nWhen you are good at writing, you make a greater connection with written Japanese and improve your character recognition, which likewise improves your reading, and helps you connect characters to meaning so that you recognize them in contexts you don't expect -- in new words, or even when people are speaking.\n\nManga is also exceedingly written exactly mimicking how people talk, so it will make understanding the verbal ticks and abbreviations much easier if you listen to and try yourself to speak Japanese while learning how to read. And on the flip side, reading these ticks and casual speech forms will help you then recognize them when people use them in anime or in real life.\n\nA small example of this: Because I've been seeing and hearing [\u65b0\u578b](#fg \"\u3057\u3093\u304c\u305f\")\u30b3\u30ed\u30ca\u30a6\u30a4\u30eb\u30b9 a lot lately, I decided to practice writing \u578b. Those few extra minutes focusing on that one kanji, and the strong mental connection to coronavirus gave me a memory to associate with, and when I heard the word [\u5927\u578b](#fg \"\u304a\u304a\u304c\u305f\")\u30c6\u30ec\u30d3, I understood it instantly and knew how it was written despite never hearing or seeing \u5927\u578b before. Because of this chain of experiences, if I see \u5927\u578b written in the future, I will not even have to think about its meaning or how to read it.\n\nThis is a mini-story of how I got one kanji \u578b and one word \u5927\u578b down to 0 seconds. When you are engaging all four skills, and switching between them, you will have dozens of chapters of these mini-stories flying by each minute. In the beginning you can't \"read\" all these chapters, there's just too much you don't know yet. But someone who can read native level texts at a reasonable speed is someone who has gone through 10's of thousands of these stories, not someone who has done 10's of thousands of flashcards.\n\n**In Summary**: I hope you will consider taking your time with Genki and other sources, because while it may feel like it's distracting you from learning vocabulary and improving your reading, it will likely end up speeding up your abilities in those areas in addition to making it easier when you decide to put a heavier emphasis on them later as you progress in Japanese.", "created_utc": "1586199589.0", "edited": "1586199831.0", "id": "fmm6bwy", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_fw2z4l", "parent_id": "t3_fw2z4l", "score": "12", "subreddit": "LearnJapanese", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qyls"}, {"author": "edlolington", "body": "I've always practiced by myself like this and it's been mostly a non-issue.

That said, to achieve a more natural English meaning I'd translate it as something like:\n\n> Mr. Inoue was working in Kobe giving musical performances where he sang along with the audience.\n\nSo customer becomes audience (because that is our word for \"customers\" of musical performances), and \"match up with what the audience sings\" becomes \"sing along\", which has the same meaning but is more natural to say.", "created_utc": "1584763967.0", "edited": "False", "id": "fl2zals", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_flug7i", "parent_id": "t1_fl2rp6c", "score": "2", "subreddit": "LearnJapanese", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qyls"}, {"author": "edlolington", "body": "Since you can look up \u6b4c\u3046 and \u5408\u308f\u305b\u308b in any dictionary, I'll assume you're having some trouble with interpreting the \u306e\u306b portion. When I first read it it tripped me up too because I usually automatically think of \u306e\u306b in the sense of \"despite/even though\". In a vacuum, \u6b4c\u3046\u306e\u306b would mean \"despite singing\", but in this case it's actually different.\n\n> [\u6b4c\u3046\u306e]\u306b[\u5408\u308f\u305b\u308b]\n\nMaybe you know that saying something like \u79c1\u306e\u3067\u3059 means \"It's mine\" -- it's a similar situation here where \u306e is being used to stand in for something. It's like a short form of \u79c1\u306e[X]\u3067\u3059 - \"It's my [something unstated]\".\n\nWhen you add \u306e to the short form of a verb, it's like saying \u6b4c\u3046[X] - \"[something unstated] that [someone] sings\" which more naturally in English would be \"what someone sings\" or \"the thing someone sings\".  In this case we have the singer included (the \u304c particle tells us \u5ba2 is doing the verb \u6b4c\u3046).\n\n> \u5ba2\u304c\u6b4c\u3046 = customer sings\n\n> \u5ba2\u304c\u6b4c\u3046\u306e = what the customer sings\n\nHopefully it makes sense how we can treat this as a noun. Since we can treat it as a noun, the form follows from the fact that \u5408\u308f\u305b\u308b (meaning generally \"to match up with\") takes an indirect object to describe what it matches with. Indirect objects use the \u306b particle, so X\u306b\u5408\u308f\u305b\u308b means \"to match up with X\". What are we matching up with? \u5ba2\u304c\u6b4c\u3046\u306e - \"what the customer sings\". The final meaning is: \"match up with what the customer sings\".\n\nI could break the whole sentence down in this way but it's a bit long-winded so I just focused on the portion you mentioned.

The way he got his head injury was especially suspicious.\n\nDuring the entire vacation the two friends he went with, Tim and Paul, noticed he was hardly eating the entire time. He'd have a small salad or some bread for lunch and dinner and would always skip breakfast, which they thought was unusual. Maybe he was trying to offset the calories from drinking every night or something, but his friends considered it out of character.\n\nOne night they were out at a sports bar that had these soccer team flags on each table that people would wave around to support their team while the game was on. Lars thought it would be funny to switch people's flags to tables supporting rival teams when they weren't looking, but this got one drunk guy who was with a group of Bayern fans (all fellow German tourists) really pissed off. Lars managed to talk it out of coming to blows.\n\nAfter the bar closes early that morning, Tim and Paul want some drunk food so they go to the only thing open between there and the hotel, a McDonald's. Lars predictably says he's not hungry and waits outside. When his friends come back out, he's gone. They look for him nearby and can't find him, so they give up and figure he got tired of waiting and went back to his room.\n\nThe next morning they meet up with him and ask him what happened, and he told them that the Bayern fans he pissed off at the bar paid some Bulgarians to beat him up (they were vacationing in Varna, Bulgaria). He said one of them hit him across the ear and he took off running.\n\nAt the time Tim and Paul were basically like \"Woah, that's messed up, glad you got away\", but after he disappeared it became clear that unless the guys punching him literally told him they were hired by some Germans to beat him, this was almost certainly some kind of confabulation.\n\nHe stayed behind to get a doctor's go ahead to fly because he didn't want to cause permanent damage to his hearing if his torn eardrum fully ruptured due to the inflight pressure changes. From there on he does all sorts of paranoid things. He gets antibiotics and texts his mom asking what they are, implying he believes they're unsafe. He checks into a small motel near the airport and then calls his mom saying something is \"weird\" about the place and asks his mom to freeze his credit cards, then calls her later and says he \"escaped\" and was hiding somewhere not in his hotel room.\n\nHe makes it to the airport and plans to have his ear checked by the airport doctor. He calls his mom to let her know he's ok, and she offers to buy him a plane ticket and a bus ticket in advance in case they say he shouldn't fly. But he tells her it's no good because they won't let him fly or be driven back. Later she finds out he told her this before he even spoke with the airport doctor.\n\nThe question is then, was Lars showing signs of mental illness and paranoia before he hit his head? In retrospect one could interpret his lack of appetite as avoiding eating because he was afraid it was poisoned or something.\n\nHowever, if he was already paranoid and his explanation for his ear was a fabrication, how did he get the ruptured eardrum in the first place?\n\nMy theory is that Lars was starting to suffer from some adult onset mental illness like schizophrenia before he hit his head and his injury wasn't what caused the paranoid behavior, rather the other way around. I wouldn't be surprised if some drunk Bulgarians came up to him while he was all alone outside McDonald's and said something in Bulgarian he didn't understand, and he was paranoid and scared enough to \"defend\" himself, leading to a fight and the ear injury. That would explain why he thought he knew their reason for \"attacking\" him.", "created_utc": "1535383074.0", "edited": "1535383383.0", "id": "e4x4q6f", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_9ahcoz", "parent_id": "t1_e4vy2jq", "score": "32", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i"}, {"author": "edlolington", "body": "That's what I like to do.", "created_utc": "1533054856.0", "edited": "False", "id": "e3cxbu8", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_93drm3", "parent_id": "t1_e3cotet", "score": "2", "subreddit": "NormMacdonald", "subreddit_id": "t5_2um0a"}, {"author": "edlolington", "body": "> Ich wusste nicht mal, dass Er krank war.\n\n-- Nietzche", "created_utc": "1531268635.0", "edited": "False", "id": "e25ven3", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_8xthlb", "parent_id": "t3_8xthlb", "score": "4", "subreddit": "NormMacdonald", "subreddit_id": "t5_2um0a"}, {"author": "edlolington", "body": "Has anyone in that thread ever even talked with a black person at length? \"Female\" is used way more often in AAVE and doesn't have the same connotation as it does in neckbeard circles.

Among the principles are technical things like fail-safe defaults, open design, separation of privilege, and so on. Obviously Microsoft has great engineers and I trust them completely on these technical points. But there is one essential point that is sorely lacking in Windows 10 updates, principle #8:\n\n**Psychological Acceptability**\n\nThis is the idea that, no matter how secure a system is in a technical sense, if the security is not conducive to system usability, it will become less secure. Think of the classic example of strict password requirements leading someone to write their passwords on a sticky note taped to their monitor.\n\nNo matter how objectively true it is that updating keeps you safe, the first time an unwanted update kicks someone out of their CS:Go match, they're going to want some control. The first time a user's carefully applied settings are reverted, they're going to be rightfully frustrated. The user frantically working against a deadline who reboots their computer and sees 30 minutes of updates are being applied will be infuriated and want it to never happen again. When that obscure 3rd party driver that Microsoft can't realistically be expected to perfectly accomodate stops working after an update, that user is going to pissed that updates \"broke\" their system. They're going to want to know how to stop that update from going through.\n\nThey were having a fine experience going about their business, Windows updated, and then they weren't.\n\nMicrosoft does not provide enough control or granularity to give these users what they want to have a good experience, perhaps in the hope that if they make stopping updates \"unsupported\", it will provide enough friction to get more users to just accept it. Undoubtedly this works, and these users grumble, move on, and hate their operating system. But at least they're secure.\n\nSome don't, and googling leads them to insecure registry hacks, taking control of system DLLs and all manner of things just to take back some measure of control. This group may objectively be making themselves less secure, but it's not their fault -- Microsoft is not adhering to the principle of acceptability and making their OS less secure in doing so.\n\nFor what it's worth, I am aware they are taking steps to fix this and hope a more mature Windows 10 does not have this problem.

Dies betrifft etwa 90 Prozent der Taten. Propagandadelikte machten den gr\u00f6\u00dften Anteil der F\u00e4lle aus. Bei den Gewaltdelikten \u00fcberwiegen teilweise die der Kategorie \u201eAusl\u00e4nder\u201c zugerechneten F\u00e4lle diejenigen mit rechtsradikalem Hintergrund. Da es insgesamt pro Jahr in Berlin laut Polizeizahlen nur zu etwa drei bis sechs Gewaltdelikten kommt, sind Schlussfolgerungen jedoch schwierig.\n\n\"According to police statistics, antisemitic crimes in Berlin are \"overwhelmingly of a far-right background\", as scientists also confirm. This comprises about 90% of cases. Defamation incidents make up the largest portion of cases. As far as violent crimes are concerned, those that can be attributed to the \"foreigner\" category outweigh in part those with a far-right background. However, because according to the police's numbers only around 3-6 such violent crimes occur a year in Berlin, it is difficult to draw any solid conclusions.\" \n\nThe articles goes on to state anti-semitic crimes have risen between 2010 and 2013 to 192 per year in 2013, and then:\n\n> Tats\u00e4chlich gibt es allerdings wohl deutlich mehr antisemitische Angriffe und Beleidigungen, als aus den Statistiken hervorgeht.  \n\n\"There are certainly more antisemitic attacks and defamation incidents than these statistics suggest.\"\n\nSo what could be the reason for this? Police and private institutions say there's a considerable unknown amount going on. But why do they go unreported? Also in the article:\n\n> Opfer antisemitischer \u00dcbergriffe w\u00fcrden teils bewusst auf Anzeigen verzichten. So w\u00fcrden beispielsweise Drohungen der T\u00e4ter Betroffene vom Gang zur Polizei abhalten. Opfer antisemitischer \u00dcbergriffe wenden sich statt an Opferberatungsstellen oder Sicherheitsorgane eher an die j\u00fcdische Gemeinde, wie die Interviews der Forscher ergaben. Wie gro\u00df das Dunkelfeld ist, k\u00f6nnen die Wissenschaftler jedoch nicht einsch\u00e4tzen.\n\n\"Victims of antisemitic incidents have at times intentionally forgone reporting them. Threats from the perpetrators are one example of an element that would keep victims from going to the police. Victims of anti-semitic abuses turn to Jewish civic organizations [or simply: the Jewish community] rather than to victim centers or public safety institutions, according to interviews with researchers. Scientists cannot say for sure how large this unreported unknown is.\"\n\nNow, if someone is afraid to go to report a crime I have to imagine physical intimidation is involved, which makes me lean on saying there is more violent anti-semitic crime than reported. On the other hand, the fact that Jewish people would prefer keeping the issue to themselves makes me think these issues must be more speech-related than violence, since surely a violent crime would be something you'd first turn to the police to rectify.\n\nMy point in all this is that while you would seem to like to be able to say that anti-semitism is cut and dry 90% white, far-right radicals, these types do tend towards non-violent defamation offenses, whilst Islamic individuals tend to commit more violent offenses. However, even this is unclear since the number of violent offenses is so low. Is it better if Muslims theoretically commit 5 out of 6 violent hate crimes against Jews in Berlin per year, while neo-nazis commit 90/100 incidents of hateful speech? Is it even relevant when the numbers are known to be deflated from the reality, and we're unaware which types are missing?\n\nIt would seem your own article is much less conclusive than you'd like to present it.\n\n", "created_utc": "1503033257.0", "edited": "False", "id": "dlscg27", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_6u19yl", "parent_id": "t1_dlrkdyq", "score": "1", "subreddit": "PublicFreakout", "subreddit_id": "t5_2yrq6"}, {"author": "edlolington", "body": "Pour moi, des sous-titres en fran\u00e7ais seraient plus utiles pour garder ma compr\u00e9hension orale en bon \u00e9tat.", "created_utc": "1502712066.0", "edited": "False", "id": "dlln9j3", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_6teyjr", "parent_id": "t3_6teyjr", "score": "5", "subreddit": "French", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rd5t"}, {"author": "edlolington", "body": "Glad to help!

The pronunciation nowadays sounds like someone speaking French with a slow, Louisiana English accent.\n\nAs for Haitian creole, when I have looked over the basics of grammar and expressions in the past, I've found that it doesn't even look French to me, and I can only barely make out what the French origins of a few words once were.

Charge characters like Guile and Deejay are balanced around the idea that you have to hold a charge to do their specials. You can \"downback\" (block, back- and downcharge, and not move) to get access to these specials, making the characters more defensive by nature. This also allows them to have better specials, with less recovery or other advantages because they can't use them on a whim. Guile's fireball is the best in Street Fighter, and is allowed to be because it's harder to spam it. Contrary to what you said, you certainly *can* do it, by throwing a fireball and immediately charging again. However, you can't do it while moving forward at the same time. The charge is a design/balance element.\n\nIt's the same with the dragon punch. The motion is harder to do because the move is better - it's the best anti-air and reversal move in every Street Fighter game (even SF5, though reversal was restricted to EX versions). It's allowed to be, because you can't do it on a whim by tapping one direction and a button.\n\nAnd I think there's more consistency to the moves than you realize. Fireballs and advancing moves have a back, forward motion for charge characters, a quarter circle forward for execution characters. Uppercuts (anti-airs, invincible reversals) have either a charge down, up motion or dragon punch motion. Moves that take to the air are either charge down, up or dragon punch. Whether the move is executed with punches are kicks depends on whether the character uses their arm/fist or their leg/foot to perform the move. There are of course some inconsistencies in this that you identified, and those are mostly cases where a character breaks the mold like Boxer or Sagat, or because another move fits better into a slot, like how Abel's roll is QCF+K, meaning his overhead kick is QCB+K even though it is also an advancing kick move. I don't think there's that much \"fucking around\" to figure out a character's moves - they are not secret. Every game gives a full movelist, and you just need to remember \"quarter circle forward punch\" instead of \"forward smash punch\". Plus, once the mnemonics of the controls sink in, it's even easier - you only have to remember the exceptions, like Sagat or Boxer.\n\nThough your system does not address things like Sagat or Abel or Boxer any better than the current system, so it does not achieve consistency unless you rework the characters' movesets. It does not achieve parity with Street Fighter's strategic balance. And it's not just a matter of reworking the dragon punch, if you remove the disparity between charge and motion/execution characters, you remove an entire class of character with their own strategic strengths and weaknesses.\n\nYou correctly identified that this control change is impossible in the current philosophy of Street Fighter, and it would require a new game and complete rework and rebalance. You can either make things inconsistent, or you can take away one of Sagat's fireballs. You can either leave the awkward-at-first dragon punch motion, or take away the strength of the tool (or allow it to become overpowered and skew the risk-reward relationship of the game). If you take these things away, you don't have Street Fighter anymore.\n\nAnd I understand that you don't really want Street Fighter - you want \"Smashfighter\" because you consider SF's controls an insurmountable or unreasonable obstacle.

I'll call your attention to the latter three bullet points and the two middle paragraphs that begin with \"Now, about special moves\" and \"That seems fairly simple\" respectively.\n\n> If blocking is automated\n\nIt most certainly is, otherwise holding back to block wouldn't even work.\n\n>  it also means that you have to press back to block, which means if they don't attack you you back up, which isn't necessarily desirable.\n\nAll Street Fighter games allow you to hold down and back at the same time, meaning you crouch, block and stay stationary.\n\n> I don't think any SSF character has more than 56 attacks.\n\nI'm not sure you're familiar enough with Street Fighter to be making the claims you're making. When you said this, I had the feeling it was a bit of a naive statement in regards to SF, though of course I couldn't be sure since I don't have the numbers memorized. I did however go into Ultra Street Fighter 4 to check my suspicion, and perhaps this will give you some further perspective on what I'm talking about in those 2 paragraphs.\n\nIn Ultra Street Fighter 4, every character needs to be capable of **39 universal moves**: 6 grounded normals, 6 crouching normals, 6 close normals, 6 neutral jump normals, 6 angled jump normals, 2 normal throws, 1 focus attack, 1 taunt, 2 directional dashes, 1 super attack, and 2 ultra combos.  Some characters have one or multiple air throws, or one or multiple special taunts.\n\nEach character has special moves. Each special move is input with either a kick or punch button, and has 3 different versions (one for each kick or punch button), plus 1 EX (powered up) version, input by pressing 2 or more buttons after doing the special motion. Some EX moves change based on which combination of 2 buttons you press, but this is not too common.\n\nEach character may have any number of command normals, attacks input by pressing one specific normal attack and a direction. \n\nWith all this in mind here are the totals for some of the more well-known SF characters:  \n\n* Ryu: 57 moves\n\n* Akuma: 69 moves\n\n* Zangief: 59 moves\n\n* Blanka: 59 moves\n\nRemember, we need 6 buttons for normal attacks, and a button + a direction is a command normal, or a crouching normal if pressing the down directinos. If we mix specials with command normals, we are mixing classes of moves. That would be like putting some characters' smashes on A, and some characters' on B. \n\nIf we want to map a single button to our specials, with the shoulder buttons, that leaves 2 buttons to dedicate to specials. If we dedicate one button + directions to one special, we can only have 2 special moves. If we make one button + one direction a special, we still don't have enough to handle different move strengths and EX moves.\n\nWe can hold 1 special button, press a normal button (or multiple for EX moves), and that will give us 4 specials with all the strengths. Hold both special buttons, and we can get 2 more. Add in forward tilt/smash and back tilt/smash and hey, now we finally have enough specials for most any SF character!\n\nBut now we have developed a system that is at best, slightly easier than the SF system. Instead of doing one sliding motion and hitting one or two buttons, you have to hold one to two buttons, hit one to two buttons, and either tilt or smash in some direction. We're still memorizing combinations of buttons and arbitrary sequences. You have replaced a well-known, working method for a completely new one that executionally is maybe a bit easier for some, but is actually *more* complex. How can I say that?\n\nThe \"Smashfighter\" system: 8 directions, 8 buttons.  \nStreet Fighter: 8 directions, 6 buttons.\n\nStreet Fighter has fewer inputs :)", "created_utc": "1487729494.0", "edited": "1487729869.0", "id": "de1rfdw", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_5s2ymy", "parent_id": "t1_ddzyiy1", "score": "2", "subreddit": "truegaming", "subreddit_id": "t5_2sgq6"}, {"author": "edlolington", "body": "Well qcf stands for quarter circle forward, so I think you were saying the same thing twice.\n\nBut regardless, which is simplest? \\[Direction + button\\], or \\[direction (slow) + button & direction (fast) + button\\]? Now you may say that it's needed for the characters to have a moveset with 8 grounded moves, but why do you need 8? If inputs should always be as simple as possible, isn't it the case that you should always sacrifice the amount of moves you have access to? By that maxim, the choice between having more diverse moves and having simpler inputs is no choice at all: to follow it you have to say it's always better to have fewer moves whenever possible if it allows for simpler inputs. Since this can be reduced to absurd levels (is it simpler to have 2 moves and 2 buttons, or 1 move and 1 button?), you can't literally mean \"always be as simple as possible\".\n\nSo let's assume you mean \"inputs should always be as simple as possible given the design objectives of the game\". Now let's examine the design objectives of Street Fighter:\n\n* An exclusively 1v1 fighting game \n\n* On the ground: 6 standing moves, 6 crouching moves (with 2 \"classes\": 3 kicks and 3 punches, ostensibly)\n\n* A variant (based on character) number of \"command moves\" (direction+attack)\n\n* A variant (based on character) number of special moves that can vary based on what strength button you press\n\n* Specials have certain properties that make them \"better\": just activating them builds meter for a super attack that is stronger than all other attacks, and if the opponent blocks them, they still take a small amount of damage (chip damage).\n\nSo let's look at how Street Fighter does from a simplicity perspective, given those design goals in mind.\n\nHolding back to block holds to the simplicity principle, because it's reusing the same input for movement and blocking and 1 input for 2 actions is better than 2 inputs for 2 actions. Unlike in Melee, we don't need to accommodate multiple players on screen, so we can have the engine recognize what direction \"back\" truly is for each character.\n\nNow, about special moves. We want to have this class of special moves, so what's the simplest way? Can we map them to a single direction + input? Some characters need those inputs for command moves. We could do that for only directions and inputs that aren't mapped to command moves, but then we have an inconsistency: sometimes pressing a direction + input gives one class of move (command normal) and sometimes it gives a special move, depending on the character. That seems like adding complexity instead of simplicity. What about inputting two directions? Like forward and back? Or down and down-forward? Well, every time you shift your direction of movement you are doing two directions, so that would lead to a lot of special moves coming out accidentally. How about three directions, such that they would have to be input intentionally? How about a simple sliding motion from forward to back, or down to forward?\n\nThat seems fairly simple, but how about we just add dedicated buttons? Surely that would be simpler. Well, how many buttons do we need? We would need as many as the character with the most special attacks. But wait, then we have buttons that will go unused on a per-character basis. Is that maybe more complex? How about pressing combinations of multiples of the 6 main buttons? Well, any more than 2-3 is going to be awkward to impossible, and 3 might even be pushing it. Street Fighter 4 did this for throws, focus attacks, and taunts. But it still needed space for its specials. How about one extra button that you could press with a direction to activate a special? That would give plenty of options. But wait, didn't we want the strength of each special move to vary based on what button we press? If there's only one button, we have to throw away one of our design goals. It's beginning to look like quarter circles aren't so complex after all.\n\nAnd remember, we want simplicity *given the design goals of the game*. As soon as someone says, \"Just get rid of the different special move strengths in Street Fighter\", then I get to say \"Just get rid of tilt moves in Smash\". Now, if you think the complexity of the design choices in Street Fighter isn't to your taste, that's perfectly fine. The whole concept of \"knock your opponent off the platform\" in a fighting game doesn't appeal to me personally in a competitive sense. But I think there's plenty of room in the gaming world for all sorts of design, and I wouldn't call either \"plain old bad design\".", "created_utc": "1487610419.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ddze8r9", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_5s2ymy", "parent_id": "t1_dduurvs", "score": "2", "subreddit": "truegaming", "subreddit_id": "t5_2sgq6"}, {"author": "edlolington", "body": "I do this thing that I'd describe as \"soft fumbles\", where rolling a 1 *which results in a failure* elicits a somewhat more severe, but consequentially identical outcome.\n\nFor example, failing to bribe a guard normally might have me saying, \"He seems unconvinced as he replies, 'Nice try, but I'd get in a lot of trouble.

After that, you can have the game designer arbitrarily put the brakes on your play, or in the case of a motion input, the only limitation is your physical ability (speed+precision).

Then why is it so hard to hit down, slide the stick to forward, and then press the button? You said you can do it yourself, actually. Well how about hitting forward, then hitting down? Anyone can do that. How about you hit forward, then down and slide forward like in the quarter circle (which you can already do)? These movements are far from complicated, they simply require a particular fine motor skill you haven't yet fully developed. At one point, holding a controller in your hands was new. Your motor skills were not there. But eventually you adapted, learned, and now you can express yourself in the gamespace via the controller. When suddenly you can't do that anymore (you run into an input requirement you're not used to), that's jarring and frustrating. But anyone who plays games is more than capable of handling it.

Here are some points that address your question:\n\n**1. Historical and Technical Reasons**  \n2D fighting games mostly differentiate themselves by how they vary from the basic ruleset pioneered in Street Fighter 2. Back in the days of SF2, everything was on arcade cabinets. Street Fighter had (and still has) 6 buttons for normal movies: light, medium, and heavy punches/kicks. If we want each character to have more than just 6 possible attacks, we need more buttons on the cabinet (not feasible) or we need some modifier to change the attack properties. The only other control was the directional stick, so if we use that we can get more \"normals\": forward/back jump, neutral jump, crouching, and \"command normals\", like Ryu's solar plexus strike (Foward+HP). So now you've got the concept of pressing one direction + an attack button. Seems pretty easy. Why not take it further to add more variation? Three directions + an attack button. Now you've added room for all sorts of \"specials\" with only six basic buttons and an 8-directional stick. Fighting games since then have always been built for cabinets and consoles, where buttons are limited but moves ought to be diverse. Keeping this historical decision lets fighters keep depth in their character movesets.\n\n**2. Balance**  \nThings like fireballs and invincible moves can be pretty powerful. We would nerf them down so they are only as strong as normal attacks, but where's the fun in that? How about we limit them by other ways. Impose a physical imitation, like forcing the player to pause their movement to do a half or quarter circle first. Think of what's required of a player who wants to throw a fireball as they walk back and forth, vying for position on the screen: to input the quarter circle forward, this forces them to first stop moving and then stop blocking by pressing down, then down forward, and finally moving towards the opponent slightly. This forces the player to slow down and make themselves vulnerable when executing the move and gives the opponent a chance to react and perhaps jump over the fireball to punish it. Imagine though if I could just sit there, blocking, and then throw a random fireball by pressing a single button. If the fireball was a very strong tool already, this makes it even stronger by decreasing how vulnerable I must make myself to use it.\n\n**3. Ultimately, Room For Error Is More Fun**  \nEvery competitive game needs to have an element of unpredictability. If similar situations play out exactly the same every time, it gets boring for players and spectators. There needs to be that X-factor, that makes you go \"Oh my god, I can't believe he/she messed that up/pulled that off!\" By giving players more of a chance to mess things up, it makes those who can pull things off and rarely if ever make a mistake even more impressive to watch. The fact that something can go wrong, that a player might mess up that combo needed to finish off his opponent or accidentally input a punishable uppercut when they meant to throw a fireball, that allows for unexpected comebacks and keeps things nailbiting. And the best part about these kinds of mistakes is that they're completely fair: there's no RNG involved, and each player has the capability to make or avoid the exact same types of input errors.\n\n**4. Variety Is the Spice of Life**  \nBuilding off of point 3, the fact that there is more room for error means that there is more room for different playstyles and choices. Do you want to be the safe, solid player that only executes simple strategies and minimizes risk? Or do you want to be the flashy player that goes for those impractical combos whenever you can, consequences be damned? Famous fighting game players like Sakonoko, known for his execution and for having several combos named after him due to their difficulty, would not be famous if there was not room for error in execution. If there is one easy, optimal solution for every situation, the game is less fun to play and watch. If there are a half dozen options, all of varying complexity, the game becomes unpredictable and allows players to feel accomplished by expressing their abilities through the charchter they're playing.\n\n**One Final Thought**  \nYou describe special moves as \"difficult timing challenges\". But... are they *actually* difficult? I have no more than an hour in Guilty Gear (bought it on a Steam sale and only messed around with it a bit), and I had never seriously played a fighting game until about 4-5 years ago. Yet, I guarantee you I could jump into Guilty Gear and within 5 minutes execute all the special moves for any character.  \nTrying anything for the first time is hard. Using fine motor skills you've never developed is going to be difficult. But once you practice it, it becomes easy like anything else. If you want to \"git gud\", focus less on how annoying the inputs are now, and more on how you can practice until they're not annoying.\n\n**tl;dr** - Special move inputs are like that for 4 reasons: they let you execute a larger variety of moves with fewer buttons, which is useful on a cabinet or console controller. They force you to slow down in order to balance how often a move can be used. They leave more room for error, allowing for unexpected comebacks and nailbiting moments. And they add variety to player skill. The inputs seem hard now, but with practice they will become easier. \n\nEDIT: Just a small clarification on my intent with this post. These are my reasons answering *why* these control schemes exist and why they continue to exist. I spend a lot of time detailing the positives, but that's not to imply there are no negatives.

To say the most direct equivalent of \"Le lion mange jusqu'\u00e0 la nuit\", in German would be like:\n\n> \"Der L\u00f6we frisst, bis es nacht wird.\"  \n> The lion eats until it's night /  The lion eats until nightfall\n\nThe thing is, if you word it that way, there's a *more direct French version* that fits that even better:\n\n> Le lion mange jusqu'\u00e0 ce qu'il fasse nuit.  \n> The lion eats until it's night /  The lion eats until nightfall\n\nI imagine they wanted to avoid that wording since it uses \"jusqu'\u00e0 ce que\" and the subjonctif, which are things you may not have learned yet.

This does however present an opportunity for us to come back better than ever in 2018.\n\n> The 2016 event and the ones before it have been a series of successes for all the participants, for us, the organizers, the speakers, and the volunteers. We have absolutely no doubts about the quality and legitimacy of our projects.\n\n> **Each year's event has had its share of challenges, notably human and structural, since the festival has grown and expanded each year.** We are taking a break today to better prepare for the future. To propel the festival forward, without forgetting the ties to our partners. Keeping the balance is important for this kind of human-centric venture. **Many of the festival's participants have long been forced to weather a storm of difficulties. These situations have led some to gleefully denounce this venture and its future. With this context in mind, we have realized that we will not be able to run the festival in the proper conditions in the coming year.** We need to do a better job of organizing our complex team while maintaining the trust you have built in us.\n\n> **We need this break to rethink some things, organize ourselves, and better forge ahead in a sustainable way.** We understand this news is tough for those close to Stunfest to hear. Each year, the festival is a unique occasion to have an exchange of common interests, to share emotions, and form friendships... We are aware of the social and cultural riches Stunfest provides. For some, the festival means their only opportunity to see each other during the year, one of those rare highlights in their video gaming lives that they cherish. For others, it means the tournament they play in just as much for the competition as for the thrill of going up against players from all over the world. For still others, it's a place where their work as a team, as creators, as researchers, is recognized and valued. We know how much participants and spectators will feel let down by our decision.\n\n> That said, you know that we're gamers too! We know the rules: pausing in the middle of a match is not cool unless it's an absolute emergency. **Trust us, we'll be here to press that START button again very soon and get back into the game bigger and better than ever before!**\n\n> We are certainly active in other forms outside of the festival, in Rennes and elsewhere. We would be delighted to see you around. You, the DNA of the festival, the players, creators, and contributors. We are always looking to you for new ways to create and build initiatives to foster the existence of new mediums. We are counting on you to keep the association's projects alive, the festival included.

And I would definitely agree that, in some imaginary situation where, to produce my next burger, every cow on earth would have to be tortured at length and then finally killed, I would refuse to have anyone make that burger. So no matter how happy that 1 burger would make me, there is certainly a line somewhere that says my  happiness must stop when too much animal suffering and loss of life begins. \n\nThe difference is that if I look at all the burgers (and all the animal products I consume over my lifespan) and I'm told thousands of animals must be killed in that time period, I am willing to accept that, just like you are willing to accept that the choice between 1 person and 1 dog will result in the death of the dog. The difference here is the extent to which an individual finds animal suffering and death compelling enough to change their habits.

Serial killers enjoy what they do but nobody would argue they should pursue happiness in that way. Ensuring people live peacefully, unmolested by violent killers, is obviously way more important than the satisfaction a killer gets from his actions.\n\nHowever, if we assume as you do that there are people who are brought genuine happiness from eating meat and animal products, and you argue that the downsides are too much to condone allowing this happiness, you are arguing that ensuring the happiness of animals is a greater imperative than ensuring the happiness of a large amount of people. \n\nAbove, you used the example of placing a carrot (plant) and a dog in front of a person and telling them they must kill one, and you posed the question, \"Which would most people choose?\" Well I ask you that same question, but with a human and a dog.\n\nObviously, most people would choose the dog.

I wouldn't worry about learning every single one of those. To explain why, think of this:\n\nYou are an English learner and want to look up the most basic word for \"to change\" in English. Imagine you got back these results:\n\n> to change out  \nto change up  \nto change around  \nto swap  \nto swap in  \nto transform  \nto switch  \nto switch out  \nto switch in  \nto exchange  \nto transmit  \nto develop  \nto convert  \nto pervert  \nto distort  \nto alter\n\nNow, you as an English speaker know immediately that while these can all mean \"change\", they are absolutely not all interchangeable and they don't *just* mean \"change\". You have to learn these words and their meanings individually.\n\nHowever to help you out, I'll give you a starting point and say that the most direct ways to say change are \u00e4ndern and ver\u00e4ndern. They are basically the same, but they have some subtle differences. \u00c4ndern mostly refers to changes of parts of things, but not the whole. When you're talking about people, it's generally aspects of their lives or personality traits. Ver\u00e4ndern is to completely change something. Examples:\n\n> Der Unfall hat leider nichts an seiner Unaufmerksamkeit am Steuer ge\u00e4ndert.\n\nThe crash sadly changed nothing about his inattentiveness behind the wheel - he is still the same person, and that aspect of him did not change.\n\n> Neue Antriebsentwicklungen haben das Auto ver\u00e4ndert.\n\nNew developments in ignition technology have changed the car - The idea of the car has transformed into something which it was not before\n\nThis can get confusing because sometimes, based on interpretation, they are interchangeable:\n\n> Die Bl\u00e4tterfarben werden im Herbst ge\u00e4ndert.  \nDie Bl\u00e4tterfarben werden im Herbst ver\u00e4ndert.\n\nThe leaves' colors are changed in the fall. Is it \u00e4ndern because the colors are just shifting for the season as they do every year, while the leaves remain leaves? Or it is ver\u00e4ndern because the new color is completely wiping away the old one? Some probably will argue one is \"more correct\" than the other, but the point is there's a little bit of wiggle room.\n\nHopefully this long-winded post was helpful to you.

For that reason, there is no other game I was more excited for this year than No Man\u2019s Sky. At the same time, I tend to look upon procedurally generated games critically; they can work out great (Rogue and co.) or not so great (Elite Dangerous).\n\n> When you generate content procedurally, please try to make it convincing. At first glance, No Man\u2019s Sky\u2019s planets look beautiful and diverse. They even hold up to a second glance. But once you get over the odd curious color combination, the colored sky (red or green), the yellow plants, and the blue crystal formations, the mostly similar plants and animals begin to reveal their astounding lack of variation. Remove the thin alien veneer and what remains are worlds that have less variation than our earthly continent of North America, for example. And let\u2019s be clear: putting a different topping on a pizza does not transform it into a grilled chicken or eggplant salad. In terms of food I find this comforting, but in a universe exploration game it\u2019s a turn-off. I wish the game had a lot more on the menu in terms of visual stimulation. Maybe some ice planets. Canyons that reach all the way to the planet core. Rivers of mercury. Or just 9km high mountains.\n\n> Countless games all the way from Rogue to Civilization, even open world titles, show how you can tease exciting situations out of interacting game systems and procedural mechanics, situations that no designer could have predicted. Even in the equally soulless Elite Dangerous, these moments can arise from dealing with contraband, or accidents at stations. In Minecraft you certainly get these in the form of mobs, lava, chain reactions, and most of all from creative building.\n\n> In No Man\u2019s Sky however, hardly any game systems interact with each other. Nothing unexpected ever happens so I can\u2019t be creative. In the end, the only thing to do is harvest resources to complete pre-made blueprints. No matter how much I destroy, I change nothing. There will always be the same types of buildings, each with one \u201cinhabitant\u201d, or sometimes none. No Man\u2019s Sky is like a GTA without pedestrians, without cars, without crashes, without missions, where the police only attack me if I pick up too many of the rocks lying around. Although unlike in GTA, there are no chases, I can\u2019t shoot out of my vehicle, and all I have to do to lose the cops is leave my engine running.\n\n> Elite Dangerous offers, despite all its procedural masturbation, the piloting of completely different types of space ships as its central content. In No Man\u2019s Sky, flying is a joke: when near to the ground it\u2019s unsatisfying and there\u2019s no sense of danger. Everything is easy, everything can be reached in seconds, or if not, in 2 minutes max. Outside of space battles, it is very hard to die. Some planets are certainly worthless, but are any awe-inspiring? Or so dangerous and exotic that I need special equipment to survive longer than a minute? Oh, no: No Man\u2019s Sky\u2019s \u201cUSK 6\u201d doesn\u2019t even bother to show a danger level. Elite Dangerous on the other hand gives you hard numbers that let you decide which missions and operations to take on. In No Man\u2019s Sky, people don\u2019t fight each other; random pirate attacks on deep space ships are completely player-centered and utterly phony.\n\n> I can admit that the resource collection does speak to me and it can easily get me in the mood for some hoarding. Being able to say, \u201cNow I\u2019ll hop back into my ship and take 30 seconds to cruise on up to the moon\u201d is cool, and despite my criticism the procedural formula does conjure some stunning combinations of planets, colors, and life forms on my screen fairly consistently. The aliens look amazing: no two members of the same species look identical. Learning my first few words felt great, so did getting my first new spaceship and making my first visit to an Atlas Interface. For the first five hours, No Man\u2019s Sky was fun because it still had all these \u201cfirsts\u201d to offer. But as they became fewer and fewer, the annoyances began to mount: Basically no physics. The inventory. The graphical pop-in. The repetitive activities. The purposelessness. The procedurally generated mundanity. Eternally killing time. After 40 hours, I wished I had stopped at 10.\n", "created_utc": "1471008811.0", "edited": "False", "id": "d6ei208", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_4x921r", "parent_id": "t3_4x921r", "score": "12", "subreddit": "Games", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhwp"}, {"author": "edlolington", "body": "I see what Norm is getting at here but in the end I think it's an argument over semantics. He's saying that comedy = funny, while anti or meta-comedy must be, by definition, unfunny. Since his jokes have punchlines that people laugh at, it's comedy.\n\nBut the way I understand it, is that while anti-comedy can be intentionally bad to shock, disgust, or make the audience think about something in a different way without laughing (which is obviously the kind Norm despises), even in the wikipedia article itself it says that this \"surprise factor\" can be the funny part, where the joke by itself isn't funny but the context makes it funny.\n\nHis moth joke, as far as I can tell, really *is* a shaggy dog story. The shaggy dog joke would not be funny if it went, \"There once was a very shaggy dog. He entered a shaggy dog contest and the judge said, 'Meh, he's not that shaggy.'\" But it is funny when you spend a long time building up how shaggy the dog is, then suddenly subvert the expectation. It's the same with the moth joke. \"A moth goes into a podiatrist's office and says he's having trouble at home with his family. The podiatrist asks him why he came here instead of seeing a psychiatrist, and the moth says 'Because the light was on.'\" By itself it's a cheap punchline and a weak joke, but when you build up the expectation with the huge setup, it hits way harder.\n\nNow, of course Norm knows way more about comedy than probably any of us, and I'm sure he'd argue that building up expectations and subverting them is the very essence of comedy, which is true. And so I think the misunderstanding is a semantic one, since anti-comedy is kind of poorly named. It sounds like \"the opposite of comedy\" (which is not getting laughs), when in reality it's more another way of getting laughs, and thus is not \"non-comedy\", but really a subgenre or type of comedy.\n\nBut in the end, Norm is just Norm, and he's funny whatever classification you give him. It's even very possible he's not misunderstanding the terms at all and is making a meta-joke about his own comedy or about commentary on comedy in general.

I wasn't even aware there was backlash or hate for them for a very long time.\n\nBut I had a turning point. There was a period in like 2006 where Blockbuster had the entire series on DVD, so I thought it would be cool to finally watch the original trilogy for the first time one week, and follow it up with the prequels next week, so I could get the experience so many other people had. Remember, at this time I had no idea about the greater fandom of Star Wars or the prequels' critical reception.\n\nI watched the originals and found them very engaging, if a bit outdated, though I was surprised how well the effects held up. I kind of laughed to myself and at the more primitive fight choreography (in my mind that was what I cared about most at the time - cool fights).\n\nThen next week I got the prequels and watched through them, expecting to feel like they were a breath of fresh air with all their modernity and better fights but... suddenly they just felt hollow. I was bored while watching them. I had no idea why, or how that had happened. I didn't think the originals were insanely amazing when I first saw them, but now in comparison the prequels were just... nothing.\n\nIt was mindblowing for me when I got linked to the Phantom Menace review years later and heard exactly the feeling I got back then distilled into an extremely clearly worded essay format.

If you've ever watched experienced people playing fighting games (not necessarily pros, just any intermediate and above players), you'll see both fighters jockeying for position with these little micromovements, ducking in and out of certain ranges. This is where most of the entire game is won or lost.\n\nPlayer 1 knows Player 2 has a move that hits fast and at a certain range, so they're strong just inside that range, in that exact position on the screen. So Player 1 will try to stay just outside of that position, so that strong move will whiff and he can punish it as it recovers. Player 2 is trying to get into that position, but he knows his opponent is trying to avoid it, so he whiffs short range attacks to bait the opponent into trying to whiff punish the wrong thing, so he will be punished himself.  \nPlayer 1 doesn't take the bait, and holds his ground, dancing in and out. Now, because he's so focused on the ground, Player 2 can bet on jumping in and catching him off guard. But Player 1 knows they've been in this position for just shy of 10 seconds now, and after about that timing last round, Player 2 seemed to get frustrated and tried this exact same thing. So Player 1 stops moving and waits, ready to anti-air. Player 2 however has noticed his opponent's sudden stop in movements and predicts that he's been read, so he now knows Player 1's focus is on the air and not on the ground.  \nPlayer 2 walks into Player 1's space, putting him in range of an attack. Player 1 knows now he's lost positioning and the opponent could hit him faster than he could react, so he's afraid to challenge, instead taking the safe option and blocking. Player 2 senses his opponent's movements have shifted to being very defensive, so instead merely walks directly into Player 1's face and throws him, doing damage and defeating the block.\n\nThat is how fighting game players think, and how fighting game fans see high level matches.

By using a reset, you're giving up the guaranteed damage of finishing a combo to go for more damage by resetting combo scaling, or by getting a knockdown and better positioning.\n\nResets generally work because, even while you're being comboed on, you want to hold block in case they mess up the combo. People will use resets to take advantage of this to catch you off guard by resetting into a throw or overhead. Here's examples where you'd want to use it:\n\n1. Playing Alex, you hit a standing Medium Punch when your opponent is close to stun. You know you can link into st.LP xx Light Flash Chop to get guaranteed damage, but instead you link st.LP and go for an overhead and extra stun. The opponent is holding down-back, expecting the full combo, and thus gets hit by the reset overhead and stunned.\n\n2. As Karin, you just did a sweet V-Trigger combo that pushed your opponent to the corner and stunned them. Their combo counter is at 8, which means combo scaling will be fairly high. So you jump in with j.HK > s.HP xx Light Dash. Then, instead of finishing the combo with the launcher, you wait and throw them instead. This does more damage than the combo would've done, since it reset the combo counter and thus combo scaling. Again, the opponent gets hit because he was focused on blocking and did not react in time to tech.\n\nNote that just because both my examples relate stun and resetting combo scaling as the main motivators for resets, they can be used whenever you want. Mika uses them in the corner to keep her positioning, or mid-screen to set up for more corner carry.

As someone who considers himself slightly right-leaning and who supports Sanders, let me frame it for you with two points:\n\n1. Election finance is corrupt. I hope we can agree on this. How can a politician on any side consistently represent the values of the people who elected them when they have to play politics to get the office in the first place by taking money from lobbyists and special interests? I wasn't even registered to vote because this fact was so discouraging. One of Sanders' main pillars is election reform, and he walks the walk. He has no big money donors and refuses help from SuperPACs. Let me stress this: **Social and economic policy can and will be debated. But the will of the people will not shine through until the system by which elected officials are chosen is fixed.**\n\n2. If Sanders gets the Democratic nomination, it means Clinton doesn't get it. I **despise** the Clintons and I think putting HRC in the White House would reinforce and compound everything that was bad about Obama's presidency.\n\n3. This is a bonus one. I don't think Bernie will get a lot of the sweeping reform he wants, but it's good to start from a high level and negotiate down for one, and I don't think someone who is so honest and consistent, no matter how much I disagree with his other policies, will irrevocably harm the country by being overly idealistic or uninformed.\n\nMy support of Bernie is pragmatic, not idealistic.

I still feel slightly behind where I should be for my level, despite grammar being about 95% automatic and second nature for me at this point.\n\nAs for how to learn the grammar, my approach was to take a subset of the grammar (for example, strong nominative declensions) and focus on that with a combination of rote memorization and coming up with a lot of simple example sentences that would use it until I felt it was mostly automatic.

The separable prefixes and post-order verb placement was deeply satisfying to hear, almost like ASMR. I also loved how repeated vowels and phonemes sounded, in things like \"anz\u00fcnd**e**t**e**\". And in that One Piece opening, at 0:26 this line is said:\n\n> Damit brach das gro\u00dfe Piratenzeit**a**lter **a**n.\n\nIt means \"Thus dawned the great age of pirates\". And it hit all those audio cues that I loved hearing in the language so well that it gave me goosebumps (it still kind of does), even though I didn't even know what the words meant at the time. This one line essentially convinced me to spend well over 1000 hours over the last 4 years of my life learning German.", "created_utc": "1451396523.0", "edited": "False", "id": "cyexawb", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_3ykzgb", "parent_id": "t3_3ykzgb", "score": "2", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "edlolington", "body": "> qualvolles Sch\u00e4chten von Tieren\n\nZumindest interessiert er sich f\u00fcr Tierrechte...

Tim and Eric are comedians that operate on this level.\n\nBeyond this level, the irony wraps around further. At this level, the humor also relies on the context and the fact that it is a tonal non-sequitur. However, the content of the humor is portrayed as highly serious. It may come in the form of seemingly legitimate attempts to steer the conversation in an abrasive direction. This can come in many forms, but it will tend to appear as a seemingly legitimate attempt to espouse radical SJW, right-wing, or religious opinions. This is the type of humor prevalent on 4chan's /pol/ board, where users appear to frequently espouse Nazism and holocaust denial. For a good example of this type of humor, check out Sam Hyde of Milliondollarextreme (/r/milliondollarextreme). The humor here comes from the absurdity of taking a post about decorating cakes, for example, and turning it into a post railing against white privilege. There can also be a lot of humor from the reactions of people who aren't in on the joke.\n\nBeyond this level, you have posts like the image from the OP.

But to be honest, in practice there's no meaning lost. As an English speaker, you have the knowledge that \"literally\" means \"in the exact sense of the word(s)\", and can be used to mean an exaggeration of \"figuratively\". If I said, \"Tim got so mad in the store that he literally lost his head and went off at the clerk\", there is absolutely no confusion about whether Tim has been decapitated. If I say \"Something went wrong with the engines and the flight crashed and burned - literally\", the context makes it obvious that literally crashing and burning is something that could very well happen here.\n\nAs for \"all intents and purposes\" and \"couldn't care less\", these are set phrases. Set phrases don't have to make sense. When have you ever heard anything like \"I'd consider the idea sound for all intents.\" Or even \"...for all purposes and intents\"? You don't hear that, because it sounds wrong, because \"intents and purposes\" is just a set phrase. What about \"long time no see\"? Where's the grammar in that? It's a Chinese phrase translated directly into English. Enough people used it to where this \"wrong\" grammar is now a part of the English language in a set phrase.\n\nFor \"I couldn't care less\", when will someone ever say \"I could care less\" and mean \"I'm capable of caring less, but I do indeed care a lot\"? Nobody expresses an idea like that. If you hear somebody say \"I could care less\", they're just using a (misheard) set phrase to express an idea that should be obvious to any English speaker in context: they simply don't care. If somebody means \"I am capable of caring less but I don't\", they will phrase it in a different way just because it's so similar to this expression.\n\nLogic is not necessarily the biggest factor in how a language works in practice, and English does not have a monopoly on nonsensical expressions or set phrases, take it from someone who's proficient in three languages. For me, the beauty in language is inherent in its infinitely varying structure and its fluidity. Consider this: Shakespeare is considered to have written some of the most beautiful English ever, but if someone today spoke to you in Shakespearean English, would you understand them? English has evolved beyond that point (note evolved doesn't mean \"become better\" necessarily, simply changed). In fact, if there existed someone today who only spoke and understood Shakespearean-era English, I would argue he should not be considered a proficient English speaker because his skills do not function in modern spoken and written communication.\n\nI guess I should amend my stance to say this: Getting your point across accurately is one of the most important things, the second being the ability to do so articulately. You can say \"Me want go store\" and you would be understood, but it would be beyond the pale for modern English. Certainly each person must decide for themselves what's \"beyond the pale\", but I certainly don't think a few slightly modified set phrases or repurposed adjectives that are clear in context qualify. \n\nHowever, if in 500 years \"me want go store\" is how everyone talks, then guess what? That's English. It's not degraded just because it sounds dumb to us now, it's just evolved. The way you say \"I want to go to the store\" in Japanese is literally \"Store to going\" (changing the verb to a noun implies \"want\", the \"I\" is also implied). And the Japanese are doing just fine.\n\nSo for all intensive purposes, I could care less ;)\n\nEDIT: that last line isn't meant to be a jab at you or anyone else, I was just being cheeky is all :)  \nEDIT2: Typos", "created_utc": "1447453694.0", "edited": "1447455261.0", "id": "cwze0ca", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_3so18a", "parent_id": "t1_cwzc9hs", "score": "22", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i"}, {"author": "edlolington", "body": "> A supply of thos beans he;s always thinking about would sure be a nice gesture as well.\n\nI lost it.", "created_utc": "1447438704.0", "edited": "False", "id": "cwz4fmk", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_3slw4n", "parent_id": "t1_cwyl86i", "score": "19", "subreddit": "me_irl", "subreddit_id": "t5_2vegg"}, {"author": "edlolington", "body": "Here's the thing, I used to be this way too.

That said, if this is the first time you've learned another language there will be obstacles to overcome. \n\nFor me, in middle school everyone had to start taking a minimum of 3 years of a foreign language, either French or Spanish. I chose French, realized I liked it, and after my first year decided to start studying it on my own. The next year I blew past all my classmates and from then on I took French up until my senior year of high school but I was always ahead of the class. Despite this, I had no idea how to study. I read French, watched French shows, looked up vocabulary when I didn't know a word and tried to memorize it, and so on. And of course I followed the curriculum we had in class. But my efforts were all meandering, I didn't have a clear strategy in mind or an end goal besides learning more and being the best in my class.\n\nAfter three years, I took a trip to Montreal. I could understand most signs and things, but I was completely lost. I'd say one thing in French and be completely lost by the time the other person got through the third word of their response. This was only partially my fault because I didn't realize at the time how unprepared I was for the accent and slang in Quebec.\n\nRegardless, I took this as a challenge. 2 years later I took a trip to France and I was able to understand everyone and communicate with ease. I guess at that point I was conversational, getting close to fluent. Now, several years later, I look back and I still feel like I'm miles ahead of where I was back then, but I still feel like I could be way better.\n\nSo the point of my rambling is that it took me about 5 years studying outside a French speaking environment just to get conversational. But if I knew then what I knew now, it would've been a lot faster. I've since studied German, and it took about 3 years in the same circumstances to get where I was after 5 in French. If I was immersed in French, it would've been even faster. But everyone is different and fluency is something every language learner is chasing all the time, there's never a point where you're simply \"fluent and done\" with a language.

And now I hear people saying things like \"Wow he just DP'd out of my pressure, I can't wait until SF5 comes around and that gets punished harder.\"   \n\"Stupid chip setups, I can't wait until you can't chip kill so easily in SF5.\"  \n\"I can't hit any of these dumb 1 frame links, I can't wait until SF5 when my execution will be way better.\"  \n\"Everyone frame traps me to death so easily, I can't wait until SF5 when you can't hit confirm and combo out of light attacks anymore.\"  \n\"Every time I knock someone down they just backdash out of it! I can't wait until SF5 when there's no more backdash invincibility.\"\n\nSure, some of this is definitely just blowing off steam. But I fear people are expecting SF5 to be the answer to all their personal woes in SF4 and using it as an excuse to mentally check out and stop improving. I guarantee you're still going to get reversal DP'd, chipped with inescapable supers, you'll drop links even if they're easier, you'll get frame trapped and tick thrown to death, and people will escape your knockdown pressure. And if you're making excuses now, you're going to be all the more discouraged when SF5 comes around.\n\nI'm looking forward to SF5 because it looks really fun, and a departure from the type of game we've been playing for the last few years. So I recommend, for the sake of everyone's mental health, to just take SF5 as it is and not expect it to solve everything in one fell swoop. Sorry for the long post.\n\n**tl;dr:** SF5 is what it is, it can't and won't \"fix\" SF4, and won't instantly make you better than you are at SF4 currently.", "created_utc": "1440595798.0", "edited": "1440596286.0", "id": "cug7th6", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_3ifg08", "parent_id": "t3_3ifg08", "score": "28", "subreddit": "StreetFighter", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qnu5"}, {"author": "edlolington", "body": "Ironically this post would fit right in on 4chan", "created_utc": "1440461963.0", "edited": "False", "id": "cueiqs4", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_3i92oj", "parent_id": "t1_cueilb7", "score": "4", "subreddit": "RedLetterMedia", "subreddit_id": "t5_2tuot"}, {"author": "edlolington", "body": "Why would people downvote this?

You can beat the delayed timing by delaying your reversal, but then you have to react to which side Abel ends up on and block if Abel decides to do a meaty attack instead (like cr. HP). And blocking won't work at all if he decides to do a command throw. So there's a back and forth guessing game, this is what's meant by the term \"okizeme\", or wake-up game.

This was achieved through a process of public surveys. Content creators would build parts of the game and then the community would provide input and make their own suggestions, modifications, and improvements in an ongoing discussion thread. \n\nWhat was ultimately placed in the game was decided on by putting it to a public survey, and after a certain percentage of consensus was reached on any one thing, that asset would be locked in to be implemented in the final game. Assets include every aspect of the game: everything from tilesets, pokemon, movesets, dialogue, trainer teams, map layouts, storylines, and so on, literally every little detail.\n\nRecently, there's been a lot of infighting, drama, and calls for redoing surveys that has bogged down progress on the game. The general impression was that people who contributed very little concretely to the project were hampering the members who actually did the most work: the comparatively few talented spriters, programmers, etc.\n\nThis core group of members, who have long since been organized in a group on Skype began to feel the community consensus requirement was hurting the game more than it was helping, and since they did most of the discussion off the board anyway, they decided they would stage a sort of \"coup\" and separate most of the process from the board's discussion threads.\n\nNow only the main content creators are in control of the project, only creating surveys for the general population as part of an arbitration process if they can't agree on something.

Based on my personal experience, it seems to be a fair generalization to make. Of course, being a generalization in the first place means it's not 100% accurate, but I'll concede that I've probably only had this conversation a few dozen times, while the combined populations of British and Americans are several hundred million unique people. It's quite possible my impression is completely wrong. It would be fairly asinine to assume a personal conclusion is 100% a fact and that anyone claiming the contrary was automatically full of bullshit or \"bluffing\". \n\nNow, on to how you personally concluded I cannot have a source on the home invasion statistics and must have made them up. [This is the paper I was recalling when I brought that up.](http://home.uchicago.edu/~ludwigj/papers/Brookings-Burglary-Policing-Ch3-2003.pdf)\n\nThe relevant information is on pg 79 under the heading \"International Comparisons\". This discusses \"hot burglaries\", home invasions where the occupants were in the residence at the time. This paper cites two more papers (Kleck and Kopel) that concluded Britain experiences these hot burglaries at a rate of 4 to 5 times that of the US. They also state this number is likely incorrect; British and American crime statistics are frequently compared incorrectly because the classifications of things like burglary, violent crime, etc. differ, and the reporting methods differ as well. The paper attempts to correct Kleck and Kopel's conclusions by comparing hot burglaries from the year 1998, a year when both countries collected statistics on them. In this case, it seemed Britain only experiences 2 times as many hot burglaries as the United States. The exact extent is therefore difficult to conclude, but it seems correct to say Britain experiences more occupied home invasions than the US on average.\n\nThere's more info in that paper that might interest somebody looking to understand the effects of gun ownership on crime as well.

In the US there is a culture of gun ownership and self-defense that's been around since the beginning, so an outright ban of firearms tomorrow would not go over the same way. Your response to someone breaking into your house to take your Xbox is \"Yes sir, feel free to take my Xbox, just please don't hurt me\".

We understand the attraction batween them is something deeper. It's the same with Korra and Asami, and it's the exact reason too why, as you said, it's perfect that they didn't end it on a kiss.

You really give Bryke absolutely no credit or respect by saying that.

Some people latched onto this and hoped for something romantic, others were fine with it being a friendship. Plus, these things are planned and written a long, long time in advance.

They took that limitation and turned it into a way to make the moment even more appropriate and poignant. The build-up to Korrasami was slow and very subtle (nigh undetectable for those who weren't paying close attention or who weren't already invested in the ship). If they came straight out with such an open display of affection, to many people it would come off as too sudden, or overreaching. We went from 0 to Korrasami in the two final minutes of the entire series, remember. What we got was a display of affection that fit with the tone of their growing relationship over course of the show: it was restrained, but as unambiguous as it could be.\n\nIf there was to be a \"kiss the girl\" ending, it would have to be built up differently throughout the series. Korra's blush was the closest we got to blatantly more-than-friends territory. In my opinion, we'd need more moments like that to make the kiss work.

The fact that Korra wrote only to Asami, and then it was brought up in episode 7 without anything coming from it besides recognition from Mako makes it feel unresolved. LoK is a series with extremely tight writing, mainly because Bryke want to do a lot of stuff but only have on the order of a dozen or so episodes to do it (which has been one of the main sources of criticism of the series compared to ATLA, but that's neither here nor there). There's rarely a scene which isn't rigidly focused on either progressing the plot towards the finale, or evolving relationships between characters. ATLA had the luxury of slower, \"filler\" episodes at times, but Korra simply does not.\n\nAnd so Korra writing only to Asami feels a lot like a plot thread. And while sometimes characters in LoK do get left behind or pushed to the side, plot threads never are. That's why I think that Korra and Asami's relationship will be addressed again, sometime within the tight 3 episode window we have left.

I started learning French 6 years ago. It was the first time I started learning a language and I took it slow, making a lot of mistakes along the way. And while I speak it very well now, *I'm still learning*. It would go much faster if I had ever lived in France, but not everybody can afford to move to another country.\n\nSo that said, you need to really *want* to learn the language. If you can get over that part, there are tons of resources online to get started for the actual learning part. I would recommend a good old fashioned textbook, to be honest, though. At least to start. There are plenty of used or earlier edition textbooks that you can get for cheap, some you can download for free online, and some you can \"obtain\" for \"free\" (if you catch my drift...) Use the textbook for grammar and basic vocabulary. Find a good textbook and read it cover to cover. Learn everything it has to offer.\n\nAlong the way, once you get a foothold in the language (not necessarily after you've finished the textbook), you need to supplement your materials. Look up lists of common vocabulary or useful vocab on a subject and use Anki to study. Go to places online that speak that language and read. After awhile, start to write. Write about your day in your new language. Write to someone on the internet. There needs to be constant input, output, and feedback in language learning. You can't learn it in a vacuum. Talk to someone. *Talk to yourself.* (Yes, I do this often) When you want to say something but don't know how, look it up and add it to Anki. When you speak with someone, ask them to correct you. Write everything down and study all the time.\n\nSpeaking of which, you need to be constantly using your language in some way. Should you study for 30 minutes to 1 hour every day? Yes. Will you? Well... Let's put it this way: I fucking love language. You've seen the long replies I've been typing out here, and in real life I could drone on for hours about grammar and syntax and all sorts of shit like that. Do I even study my languages that long every single day? HELL NO. That would get boring as hell. But I do *think about* my languages every single day. Even if it's just a passing thought that I think in German instead of English, even if it's just ordering at a cafe and wondering afterwards how I would've ordered the same thing in French. Whenever I think about something like this and I'm not sure of the answer, I look it up. And I write it down. And I study it later. \n\nHonestly I could probably write an entire book on all this stuff so I'll cut myself off here.

Translating songs and poetry is much less an exact science, so all the elements don't always come through perfectly, but I feel like I do a fairly good job of it.\n\nHere's the example I was talking about, first in French and then with my English translation:\n\nAccourez maintenant, amis, \u00e9pouses, m\u00e8res !  \nVenez compter vos fils, vos amants et vos fr\u00e8res !  \nVenez sur ces d\u00e9bris disputer aux vautours  \nL'espoir de vos vieux ans, le fruit de vos amours !  \nQue de larmes sans fin sur eux vont se r\u00e9pandre !  \nMais au sort des humains la nature insensible  \nSur leurs d\u00e9bris \u00e9pars suivra son cours paisible :   \nEt le sol, engraiss\u00e9 de leurs restes fumants,  \nCachera sous des fleurs leurs p\u00e2les ossements !   \n\nGather round widows, wives, and mothers!  \nCome count your sons, lovers, and brothers;  \nFight against the vultures at the foot of the rubble,  \nYou loved and raised them, now see the fruits of your trouble...  \nOnly your tears now remain!  \nAs human flesh prepares to return to its source,  \nDispassionate nature will again take its course...  \nIn the fertilized ground flowers soon will have grown,  \nWho would guess that below them hide fields of bleached bone!\n\nEDIT: Looking back, I'm a little disappointed that I wasn't able to capture the gory imagery from the original...

You need to jump through hoops Google Translate to get the right tense and form in anything beyond the most trivial.\n\nOne example would be the verb h\u00e4ngen, where it doesn't distinguish between the transitive and intransitive forms:\n\nEnglish|German|Google Translate German\n:--------------------------------------|:--------------------------------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nHe hung the shirt                      |Er hat das Hemd geh\u00e4ngt                      |Er legte das Hemd\nShe hung the shirt                     |Sie hat das Hemd geh\u00e4ngt                     |Sie h\u00e4ngte das Hemd (not wrong, but let's try to get the perfect...)\nShe has hung the shirt                 |Sie hat das Hemd geh\u00e4ngt                     |Sie hat das Hemd hing (???)\nShe has hung the shirt on the hanger   |Sie hat das Hemd auf den Kleiderb\u00fcgel geh\u00e4ngt|Sie hat das Hemd auf den Kleiderb\u00fcgel geh\u00e4ngt (Yay!)\nShe was hanging the shirt on the hanger|Sie h\u00e4ngte das Hemd auf den Kleiderb\u00fcgel     |Sie hing das Hemd auf dem B\u00fcgel (used the intransitive form instead of transitive)\nThe shirt was hung there               |Das Hemd wurde dort geh\u00e4ngt                  |Das Shirt wurde dort h\u00e4ngen (???)\nThe shirt hung there                   |Das Hemd hat dort gehangen                   |Das Hemd hing (wtf? let's try something else...)\nThere hung the shirt                   |Da hing das Hemd                             |Da hing das Hemd (ding ding ding!)\n\nSo I know h\u00e4ngen is a particularly tricky word, but first of all, if this was the first time you encountered it, the difference between transitive and intransitive would be baffling and most likely used incorrectly.

Werden is a very widely-used verb that has meaning both as a grammatical part of a sentence and as a verb by itself. I'll give you a brief overview but I'll suggest you look to a dedicated textbook for the more in-depth answer. I simply can't cover every detail: Your question is a bit like if somebody asked you: \"What are the words \"do\", \"doing\", \"did\" and \"done\"  in English and when can I use them? Keeping that in mind...\n\nWerden is both the infinitive form and one of its conjugations (for plural 'sie' and 'wir'). Its direct meaning is \"to become\". Ich werde, du wirst, er/sie/es wird, wir werden, ihr werdet, sie/Sie werden. I become, you become, etc. As an example: \"Water conservation is becoming ever more important.\" => Die Wasserversorgung wird immer wichtiger.\n\nGrammatically, it can help form the future tense by conjugating for the subject and placing an infinitive at the end of the clause. \"I will/am going to watch this video.\" => Ich werde dieses Video ansehen.\n\nIt can also function as a grammatical part of the passive voice. In English, the passive voice comprises things like: \"The book is being read.\" This passive is formed by conjugating werden for the subject (in this case Das Buch, es) and placing the past participle at the end of the clause: Das Buch wird gelesen.\n\nAll the examples you provided are different tenses of werden. W\u00fcrden is the conditional form, it translates in most cases to \"would\". Sometimes you should use it to agree with another conditional verb in in a connected clause, but sometimes it stands alone. Two examples for this:\n\n\"If if I were you, I would take the subway.\" => \"Wenn ich an deiner Stelle w\u00e4re, w\u00fcrde ich mit dem U-Bahn fahren.\"\n\"I would take the subway, but I don't know my way around the city yet.\" => \"Ich w\u00fcrde mit dem U-Bahn fahren, aber ich kenne mich in der Stadt noch nicht aus.\"\n\nWurde is one of the two possible past tense forms of werden. It can be used either to mean \"became\" or to use the passive voice in the past tense. Remember \"Das Buch wird gelesen\" from before? What if we wanted to say \"it was read\" or \"it was being read\"? Now it's: \"Das Buch wurde gelesen.\" Or... \"Das Buch ist gelesen worden\". I won't get into that second construction, though.\n\nDas war ja nur die Oberfl\u00e4che! Read up on the specifics of these things in more detail... All the uses of werden are essential to speaking German and there is much more detailed information you should become familiar with that I can't cover in one post. Speaking of covering everything, here are two more important things that I wasn't sure where to mention:\n\nMini-Tip #1: Werden is like sein in that its direct objects will always take the Nominative Case.\n\nMini-Tip #2: The passive voice can describe \"goings-on\", or general activities/events when used as follows:\n\n> \"Es wird getanzt.\" => There's dancing.\n\n> \"Es wird geklopft.\" => There's [a] knocking.\n\n> \"Hier wird laute Musik nicht gespielt.\" => There's no loud music playing [allowed] here.", "created_utc": "1392068370.0", "edited": "False", "id": "cfc04rv", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_1xihqn", "parent_id": "t1_cfbvn3k", "score": "3", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "edlolington", "body": "Someone may beat me to it, but here's my take.\n\n1. I call it a smokestack. Smoke comes out of it.\n\n2. I'm pretty sure \"in future\" is completely incorrect. I can't think of a context where it would sound correct. All those examples you used should use \"in the future\".\n\n3. \"I put all my stuff inside and velcroed the container shut.\" \"My four year old hasn't learned to tie his shoes yet, so I got him a pair that he can velcro.\" - You can use it as a verb to replace the phrase \"to attach/close via velcro\".\n\n4. Both sound fine to me, even though I personally would never say \"sneaked\". \n\n5. Your first suggestion is exactly how I would word it. \"out of\" or \"out from\". To say he's dumping them would indicate he's doing it intentionally (though that's only my personal take on it, it wouldn't sound particularly wrong to use your second suggestion).\n\nSource: American English.\n\nEdit: Answered question five.", "created_utc": "1392047239.0", "edited": "1392048297.0", "id": "cfbq5ke", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_1xihqn", "parent_id": "t1_cfbpqjx", "score": "5", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "edlolington", "body": "> We made some [obligatory] meme references\n\nOuch.", "created_utc": "1392042688.0", "edited": "False", "id": "cfbom3c", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_1xbuzu", "parent_id": "t3_1xbuzu", "score": "1", "subreddit": "rit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3x"}]
