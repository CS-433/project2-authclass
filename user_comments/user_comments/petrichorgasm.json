I don't have the link to the og post, but I still have the recipe:\n\n****\n\nBlack Beans \n\nOh my friend, it's called Cuban Black Beans. REAL Cuban black beans, not that shit they serve in restaurants.\n\nYou get a lot of diced sweet onions and peppers (red is best balance of sweetness to price) and you cook them over medium heat in a lot of olive oil. How much olive oil? Say you have one big onion and two decent sized peppers, then I say at least a half a cup. Once the onions are softening up, you add garlic. How much garlic? ALL THE FUCKING GARLIC.\n\nThen you cool it down with some white wine (not too sweet, something middling). Let it steam off for a minute. What you're doing is killing the rest of that raw garlic taste and letting the alcohol in the wine bring out the rest of the flavors.\n\nThen you add black beans. I use canned, un-drained straight beans (don't get the kind that's labeled \"black bean soup\"). Some will tell you canned isn't as good. I say bullshit. I use one and a half times as much by volume as I have of the onion/pepper/garlic mixture.\n\nSimmer the beans for a bit, low-medium. Then you will add an ounce of ground cumin, a shot glass' worth of oregano, and a packet or three of Goya Sazon (if you don't know what that is, look in the Mexican/Spanish/Ethnic section and look for little boxes that say Goya). If you want to be a boss, add three or four bay leaves, but don't forget to pull them out later -- no one wants to eat a bay leaf. Mix it in well.\n\nEither move it to a crock pot or put it in a 225* oven. Check it every once in a while -- you want the beans to be soft. You do not want this to burn, so scrape the bottom. I'd sooner eat your shit than burnt black beans, and so would you.\n\nNow after a few hours taste it. More flavor? Add more cumin and Goya. Needs a kick? Add some lime. You know what? FUCK YOU, ADD LIME ANYWAY.\n\nTraditionally, this is served over rice. FUCK THAT. I serve it in a bowl. Maybe throw some shredded pork on that bitch. FUCK ME.\n\nIf you use enough onions, peppers, and wine, these will be surprisingly sweet. (My Abuelita accused me of adding sugar, that bitch.) The beans, cumin, and oregano will give it a rich, earthy flavor. Goya is just magic. And the wine and lime will give just a hint of tartness. The beans, slow-cooked, are almost meaty (in a braised meat sort of way, not in a fuck-yeah-cow-meat kind of way). Once they cool down a bit, it will have a thicker texture, so let it sit for a little bit.\n\n\n---\n\nForever a favorite, vegetarian-friendly.", "created_utc": "1665697678.0", "edited": "False", "id": "is7lpu1", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_y2d2nu", "parent_id": "t3_y2d2nu", "score": "2", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i"}, {"author": "petrichorgasm", "body": ".....listen, I'm a CNA.

I was to go to Germany next month for my annual trip, but with this injury, the 12 hour flight was out of the question.

Not as big a crowd as it used to be and the shops aren't as good, but what's there is good enough. A lot of the quirky things that made the market good has almost all but disappeared or hiked up in price, though. Idk, once the news stand disappeared, it lost a part of its personality.

With that, you'll have to deal with all the mentally ill homeless and addicts that come through my hospital while they're out in the wild, before they set fire to a garbage can and are detained.

He has two really precocious, deeply intelligent and thinky children. I love them to the ends of the earth. Yeah, they didn't come out of me, it's that my love for their father naturally extends to them. They're good kids. I know my role is not to be a stepmom, since I'm only the girlfriend, and I'm not trying to be, my role, as I understand, is to be there for them, praise when praise is warranted, and support when they are needing it.\n\n\nI'm glad this is where I am with them. But, this year, it feels like the closer I bond with them, the further away he pulls. I cry almost every week, but that's another story.\n\n\nMy boyfriend tries his very best at being a single parent. I won't go into details, just that he's divorced. The kids adore him and I can see they are very secure with him. \n\n\nHe is a very good dad, but he's not a very good partner. That's something that blew my mind when I realized it today, sitting in my car at the parking lot near his house because I was so drained at all the emotional labor I was expending.\n\n\nI admire his tenacity, steadfastness, intelligence, nurture towards his children and everybody else. I see it and only now did I realize he has none left for me. He used to warn me that he's not an affectionate guy, but he will  try harder with me.\n\n\nHe's affectionate to the children, as he should be. Now that he's working from home, I notice he's supportive and nurturing when I hear him talk to his intern who was just starting out. Very fatherly.\n\nBut with me, he just doesn't pay attention. I've tried bringing it up in all manners of emotion, but it's as if I'm not important.\n\n\nI moved in after 2 years of dating.

My story: first one, lexapro; worked very well, but my insurance didn't cover it, so I got put on celexa, which didn't work at all. So I went cold turkey for a few years. It was hard and I was fighting depression, anxiety, and suicidal thoughts every day.\n\nI changed jobs and my insurance improved. So I got a new doctor and ask to be put on lexapro. This time, it fucked with me. I was foggy, hazy, sad, crying, and lost all interest in EVERYTHING. I wanted to keep going because I knew that it takes at least three weeks and up to six months for it to work. But it was so bad I swore I'll never go on medications again. \n\nA couple of months later, the suicidal thoughts, the depression, and the anxiety got so bad I didn't know what to do. I wanted to go back to school and finish my degree and I know that I can't do that with the severe depression and anxiety. \n\nI tamped down the negative thoughts and worked up the courage to tell my doctor and asked to be put on something else. She is very supportive of mental health and is the most knowledgeable PCP regarding depression and the medications I've ever had. She also knew about my depression and always does a check on with me when I see her for something else.  First PCP I've had to do that.\n\nAnyway, I'm 29 days into my current medication, got my first refill and I feel great. No fog, no, despair, no overanxiety. If I had known I can feel this normal and good, I would've done it a hell of a lot sooner. \n\nThis is my own experience. Take from that what you will. I'm glad I made the hard decision to try one more medication. If I hadn't, I never would have discovered this other me. The me who isn't doomy and gloomy, the me who is relaxed, the me who can plan and construct a future not bound by fear and limits.\n\nCheers and hugs to you, u/sans_peur.

It was so difficult to make those phone calls, to open up, to ignore the inner voice telling me it won't work.\n\nI started with therapy, and it helped immensely, unfortunately, it got really expensive so I had to stop. Then I decided to open up to my doctor. The first medication had me crying all the time. The second medication my doctor put me on fared much better.

I don't have daily suicidal thoughts anymore, work is bearable, and best of all, I can focus.\n\nI realize everyone is different and I realize that in the US, mental health is not well understood.
