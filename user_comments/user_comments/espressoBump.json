The only difference is the language itself, which is the vessel to think in.\n\nHe could have been talking about the structure of the sentence, which is different and a slightly inaccurate choice of words on his part. Then he should have said you have to understand the strucute of *an* Asian language before you speak it. He classified all Asian languages as the same and thinks all of the people from Asia \"think conceptually.\" This is where I'm making my generalization on him, because he is making a generalization on Asians. Russian, Japanese, Hindi, Vietnamese, and Chinese are all very different. In any combination you use to group Asians based on their language and say \"these people\" think conceptually is a generalization to me. It's just a way of saying they're different, they don't think like us. I find this surprising from a man who claims to be a polyglot. I get there are cultural differences but they also doesn't hinder the language learning process.\n\nThe only other way I can take it is, you have to think conceptually to understand Asian languages. Meaning, I have to think in abstract thoughts to speak an Asian language. In my case this is not true at all. I can quite literally find words to translate and convey everyone of my ideas.\n\nAsian discrimination is a silent one and I don't think they get enough support. I know because, I do everything I can to make sure I understand how my wife feels. I clarify things all of the time. These situations, are common for her and she puts up with it.

I need the vocabulary, grammatical structure, and words to act as a vessel to get my ideas out.\n\n\ubd88\ucee4 in Korean is turn on the light. \ubd88 is light, \ucee4 is to turn on. I have this concept and use these words to express it in two different ways \"turn on the light\" and \"\ubd88 \ucee4\".\n\nSo the issue I have with him isn't thinking in concepts, but rather, pointing Asians out as different for having to do so. I have to assume he thinks he can't learn an Asian language without thinking in *their* concepts.\n\nThe other naive point is that he wrapped all Asian languages into one. I just wonder if his same rules apply to all Asian languages. Why don't Germanic and Romance language speakers think concepts?\n\nI think he was just intimidated by such an extremely different language and thought, \"wow, I can't do this without thinking like them\".
