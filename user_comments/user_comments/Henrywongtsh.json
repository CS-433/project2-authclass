Its presence in the province can be reasonably dated back 200+ years ealier but the massive and extensive population replacement throughout the Southern dynasty, especially around the Lower Yangtze Plains has likely erased all Para-Min/Para-Middle Chinese varieties spoken outside the mountainous province.\n\nNow as the Qieyun\u2019s preface tells us, the idea of Qieyun was conceived when during a gathering, *L\u00f9* and a few of his friends got into an argument over sounds and character readings, ending with *L\u00f9* drawing an outline of the eventual Qieyun after much discussion between the friends.\n\nWhat this preface tells us is that the Qieyun\u2019s system is based on the speech of *L\u00f9* friend group that night. Other than *L\u00f9*, from modern H\u00e9be\u030ci, they are : *Li\u00fa J\u012bn*, *Y\u00e1n Zh\u012btu\u012b*, *L\u00fa S\u012bd\u00e0o*, *Li\u030c Ru\u00f2*, *Xi\u0101o G\u0101i*, *X\u012bn D\u00e9yu\u00e1n*, *Xu\u0113 D\u00e0oh\u00e9ng* and *W\u00e8i Y\u00e0nyu\u0101n*.

Yet, no Pre-Qieyun rhyme dictionary that we know of was compiled by someone from F\u00faji\u00e0n.\n\nThe Qieyun\u2019s preface also name-drops a few locations of mergers in them, implying some knowledge of their speeches.

Beijing won with 52 votes but Southwestern (which Sichuanese is part of) came second with 51. Third and fourth were Wu with 46 votes and Yue with 25 votes\n\nMin substrate in Wu languages :\n\nWu shares some unique features with Min varieites, leading to some to propose that modern Wu had a substrate from some sort of Min variety. Evidence for it mainly stems from similar words for \u201cfoot\u201d and \u201cman\u201d\n\nYue-Gan hypothesis :\n\nHypothesis linking the Yue and Gan branches, I don\u2019t think anyone really accepts this tho\n\nSuzhou numerals :\n\nAlso known as \u82b1\u78bc \u201cflower numerals\u201d, they are basically a unique way of writing numbers, which you can see [here](https://zh.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Huama_numerals.svg)\n\nRealisation of Null initial :\n\nBased on who you ask, null initials in Sinitic languages can be transcribed as either \u00d8- or \u0294-.

Whilst most topolects do palatalise them before Middle Chinese division III words (eg \u9152), Mandarin topolects (most, not all) is notable in that it also targets division II words (eg \u8766, \u87f9), one of the main evidences for a Mandarin classification of Hangzhou.

Old Xiang is notable as being a really conservative variety with preservation of voiced obstruents, checked tone and more. Mew Xiang is more Mandarin influenced and has thus lost most of it\n\nPara-Sinitic :\n\n\u201cMainstream Sinitic\u201d (ie Min + the big seven) is not the only Sinitic found on the tree.

They generally corresponde to different generations with Old usually the 1920s or older, Middle dates to around the 1940s to 1960s and New is everything after that.

In the original 1987 \u4e2d\u570b\u8a9e\u8a00\u5730\u5716\u96c6, Yuexi Hakka is listed as unclassified though the 2012 version reclassified it as Hakka\n\nGan-Hakka hypothesis :\n\nThis hypothesis aims to unite to two branches of Hakka and Gan into a common node descended from Middle Chinese.

Basically to describe a character two characters are written in the format XX\u5207. The former has the same initial as the transcribed character and the latter has the same rhyme (and usually tone). Using standard Mandarin as an example :\n\n\u770b (k\u0101n/k\u00e0n) could be Fanqie\u2019d as \u82e6(**k**u\u030c)\u809d(g**\u0101n**)\u5207. This is especially helpful in a character has no or only esoteric/rare homophones.\n\nQieyun :\n\n the year 601, a bunch of scholar came together for a sleepover. During which they got into an argument over how to pronounce old texts and poetry as you do. So they set out to make a golden standard for pronunciational and rhyming purposes, and thus birthed the Qieyun, which became the de facto standard for the rest of the Tang Dynasty.\n\nStrata :\n\nIn their long history, Sinitic language shave accumulated multiple layers of strata. Most generally have three layers, a substrate from the language spoken there before them, their native inherited layer and a literary layer composed of Mandarin character reading loans\n\nMinjiangese :\n\nMinjiang is a variety of Chinese spoken in Sichuan.

They can be pretty much any sequence of tones and they don\u2019t need to be able to be realised on a single syllable.\n\nIf a melody is disallowed from associated onto a single syllable, usually extra tones are associated onto syllables further right. So if your languages **disallow** rising tones, a LH melody might be associated onto words like *maka* as m\u00e0k\u00e1\n\n> So, does this mean that in such a language, the words in a sentence would alternate between high and low tone only?\n\nThe section gets into quite dense Register Theory stuff so beware :\n\nOne key idea of tone is that each tone is underlying composed of two distinct components, the \u201cregister\u201d that sets the general base line and the actual tone with defines where the tone is **relative** to the baseline.\n\nSo even though we only have two underlying tones H and L, when combined with registers, we can get  a maximum of four allowed combinations : *Hl, Ll, Hh, Lh*. Though many languages conflate *Lh* and *Hl* as \u201cMid\u201d tone\n\nIn many Bantu languages, a L drags the **register** of a following H lower. So you can have a phonological phrase of the tone level 5144413122 with a continuous lowering of the relative register on the high tone\n\n> How would tone sandhi work? If I had a word /masa/ with a low tone, and attached the suffix /ku/ to it, /ku/ would probably also take a low tone, though if it had a high tone, then that high tone could spread to the stem.\n\nIt depends on two things : one, is the low tone in /masa/ underlying a L melody or \u00d8 melody? And two, how does tone spread\n\nFor question one : null associated syllables have a tendency to be realised as L (assuming no other tones attach on) though some languages like Bora instead have default \u00d8 = H\n\nFor question two : if your tones spread left, H could spread onto \u00d8 syllables where as L might block such expansion.

The most common is nominative-accusative where S and A are treated the same and P is marked differently such as English or Japanese\n\nAlternatively, there are languages that treat S and P the same and marks A differently such as most Mayan languages or Basque, these are called [ergative-absolutive languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ergative\u2013absolutive_alignment)\n\nThe above two are the most common but there are also others like Active-Stative where S gets treated like A or P depending on certain contexts; direct alignment, where S A P are all treated the same; tripartite, where S A P are all marked differently and others\n\n[Noun cases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_case) marks the role of the noun in a clause/sentence, ie if the noun is the subject, object, location, possessor, destination or others\n\n[Tense, Aspect and Mood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tense\u2013aspect\u2013mood) are three closely linked yet fundamentally different concepts. Tense describes when the action happened, aspects how it happened and mood how the speaker feels about it/how it relates to reality. So taking from English,\n\nthe present and past are tenses as they describe when the event happens,\n\nthe progressive and perfect are aspects as they describe how an event relates to the flow of time\n\nthe imperative and subjunctive are moods as they describe how the speakers feels about the event/how it relates to reality\n\nAnalytic vs synthetic refers to in general how many [inflectional morphemes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflection) a language can have per word. On one end of the spectrum are isolating languages that basically don't have any inflectional morphemes and rely on word order, particles and other strategies. Some examples include Hmong. Moving up, we have analytic, where the might be some inflectional morpheme but it is still minimal. Some examples include English or Hawaiian. Continuing up are synthetic languages where there is a decent number of inflections per word. Some examples might include Korean or Latin. And on the other extreme is polysynthetic where they is a large amount of inflectional morphemes per word. Some examples might be Halkomelem or Classical Tiwi\n\nAs for fusional and agglutinative, it basically refers to, in general, how many meanings each non-root morpheme can have. Some languages have a rather strict one meaning per morpheme rule like Japanese where as others can have inflectional morphemes have two, three or four meanings like Latin or Ancient Greek. However, many languages do show a mix between these two and many linguists don't actually subscribe to these categories (isolating<->polysynthetic, agglutinative<->fusional) so think of these as guidelines or railings for your language than any concrete hard rule\n\nIn English, we tend to distinguish between \"here (close to the speaker)\" and \"there (far from the speaker)\".

Triggered by a following *i, it affected all non-high front vowels, leading to alternations like \n\n> *foot (< f\u014dt < \\*f\u014dts)*  \n*feet (< f\u0113t < f\u00f8\u0304t < \\*f\u014dtiz)*\n\nOther than i-mutation, there were also other mutations that only affecting some languages like : a-mutation (*horn* < *hurn\u0105) as well as u-mutation (OE seofon \u201cseven\u201d < \\*sebun)\n\nMoving on, we arrive in Northern Vanuatu. (Ignoring length,) Northern Vanuatu languages have notably larger vowel inventories than than other Oceanic languages. Some languages such as Lemerig can have as much as 10 phonemic monophthongs. These additional vowels general developed from sound changes similar to umlaut where post-tonic vowels led to more stressed distinctions. \n\nA good example to illustrate this is with the reflexes of the near homonymous Proto-Oceanic pair *paRu \u201csea hibiscus\u201d and *paRi \u201cstingray\u201d in Lo-Toga, Lakon and M\u0101ori\n\nProto-Oceanic | Lo-Toga | Lakon | M\u0101ori\n:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:\n*paRu | \u03b2\u0254r | \u03b2a\u02d0 | whau\n*paRi | \u03b2\u025br | \u03b2\u0153\u02d0 | whai\n\nNext up in the Caucasus are Nakh languages. They notably have way more vocalic distinctions (> 10) than other Caucasian languages, which usually only have five or six.

Whilst phonetics wasn\u2019t exactly good in Ancient Times, we can still glean a lot from how people described the language. For example, contemporary Latin scholars described *C* as \u201cstanding strong before all vowels\u201d, implying the hard/soft C distinction was not present during Classical Latin and *C* was uniformly /k/.\n\n\nTwo, Reconstruction based on modern (or historical ones where the phonology is well understood) descendants.

For example, even though most modern Romance languages have /b~\u03b2~v/ as a reflex for Latin *v*, we are reasonably certain that it was originally /w/.

This is somewhat correlated with functional load but not necessarily (tho I can\u2019t think of a counter example just yet)\n\n> All of this to say that I would interested to compare the poetry in the regions.\n\nI am more familiar with post-Qin Chinese poetry, so I will be focusing on it :\n\nChinese poetry can be divided into those that were sung and those that were not^[Note]\n\nStarting all the way back in the Han dynasty (-206-200), there were two main types of poetry, \u6a02\u5e9c yu\u00e8fu\u030c \u201cmusic residence\u201d and \u53e4\u9ad4\u8a69 gu\u030cti\u030csh\u012b \u201cold-type poetry\u201d. Yuefu are generally those that were sung and guti were those that were not. Since tone was likely not as prominent as it would be, there wasn\u2019t yet a emphasis on tone categories. Rhyming was also more lax, words from different tone categories (mainly the Sh\u00e0ng and Q\u00f9 tones) can be rhymed though it is rare and words from different finals can be rhymed if they are similar. The restriction of how many syllables per line wasn\u2019t as strict so lines can have differing amount of syllables but same-syllable poetry is more common.\n\nYuefu and Guti would persist as the dominant form of poetry throughout the Three Kingdoms and Northern & Southern dynasties periods. However, this situation would change during the Tang Dynasty (618-907).\n\nThe Tang Dynasty saw the rise of two new types of poetry : \u8fd1\u9ad4\u8a69 j\u00ecnti\u030csh\u012b \u201crecent-type poem\u201d and \u8a5e c\u00ed \u201clyrics\u201d. Jintishi are not usually sung whilst ci are. Ci are also characterised by the \u8a5e\u724c c\u00edp\u00e1i, the music it is set to as ci are essentially people writing lyrics.\n\nJinti are also divided into \u7d55\u53e5 ju\u00e9j\u00f9 and \u5f8b\u8a69 lu\u0308\u0300sh\u012b with jueju having 4 lines and having 8 or more. \n\nBoth types are characterised with stricter rules. The four tones at the time were divided into two categories \u5e73, which includes the Pi\u0301ng tone, and \u4ec4 which includes the other three. Since tones had become a prominent part of Chinese, both styles started to require a set template for which tone categories can go where.\n\nFor Jinti, rhyming also became more strict, oftentimes requiring the rhyming words to be the same in both tone and final and changing rhymes mid-poem became a no-no. The vast majority of rhymes are in the Ping tone but Zhe rhymes can be found. Where the rhyming appeared was also restricted with the odd lines (other than the 1st) never allowed to rhyme and even lines requiring to be rhymed. The line structure can only allow 5 or 7 syllables per line. Couplets that were common in Guti also became mandatory in Jinti.\n\nAs for ci, its structure is heavily dependent on its music with each cipai having a set template of syllable number per line and tone categories. Usually the lines have odd syllables but even ones can be found. How and where the rhyming can go is also more complicated and usually dependent on the specific cipai.\n\nCi would eventually develop into \u66f2 q\u01d4 \u201ctune\u201d during the Mongol Yuan dynasty. Qu are mostly similar to Ci with some differences on rhyming patterns as the tone categories in the vernacular continued to evolve.\n\nWrapping things up, we have \u65b0\u8a69 X\u012bnsh\u012b \u201cnew poem\u201d, characterised as poems written after 1912. They represent a break from the rigid rules of the post-Tang poetry and put a heavy emphasis on rhythmic feel, oftentimes not even requiring rhyming nor fixed syllables per line.\n\nTldr : pre-Tang poetry is characterised by a strictening of rules until the Tang when the rules basically became set in stone. This changed in the 19th and 20th century due to a combination of Western influence and rebellion against the old system.\n\n[Note] : since most of the music has been lost, in modern times, none of them can be sung", "created_utc": "1650883289.0", "edited": "1650883668.0", "id": "i6448r7", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_uaok1t", "parent_id": "t1_i63ye4n", "score": "1", "subreddit": "asklinguistics", "subreddit_id": "t5_2u7nj"}, {"author": "Henrywongtsh", "body": "Each has their own reasons :\n\nFor \u201cai\u201d and \u201cay\u201d, they originally represented /ai/ but  the vein-vain merger in the 14th century raised the main vowel to /e/\n\nFor aCe, it was originally pronounced something like /aCe/.

(thanks for the correction u/Jeketi)\n\nIn Germanic, this root first got affixed with the suffix -t\u00f3s, becoming *k\u0301unt\u00f3s. Here, the root under went ablaut when the suffix got added, shortening the -wo- > -u-. \n\nIn the transition to proto-Germanic, a few major changes occurred.\n\n1. Centumisation. The basically means *k\u0301 becomes normal *k (as opposes to what we will see in Sanskrit)\n\n2. Grimm\u2019s + Verner\u2019s law. The traditional \u201cvoiceless\u201d sounds of PIE (*p *t *k *k\u02b7) lenitied in Proto-Germanic to become *f *\u03b8 *h *h\u02b7 (Grimm\u2019s law) excepted if the previous syllable is unstressed (lacking the acute marker), in which case it will voice to *b *d *g *g\u02b7 (Verner\u2019s law)\n\n3. Proto-Indo-European *o became *a\n\n4. Final *-s becomes *-z in the nominative, not sure why. I guess it is possibly due to analogy with other words that shifted to *z due to Verner\u2019s law\n\n5. The stress shifted to the first syllable\n\nThis results in Proto-Germanic *hundaz.\n\nIn becoming modern English, there were mainly three sound shifts involved.\n\n1. Loss of unstressed syllables. Basically the final *-az was lost due to it not carrying any stress and being word final, common in all of Germanic (*hundaz > *hund)\n\n3. Homorganic lengthening. The resulted in the main vowel *u to be lengthened to *\u016b due to the following cluster *nd. (*hund > h\u016bnd)\n\n4. The Great Vowel Shift. One of the main English defining shifts. Seriously messed up the vowel system and for our purposes shifted *\u016b > /a\u028a/, hence modern *hound*\n\nSanskrit is much more simple.\n\nSanskrit inherited PIE *k\u0301w\u00f3n without any suffixes like Germanic did.\n\nIndo-Iranian underwent Satemisation as opposed to centumisation like Germanic. So it shifted PIE *k\u0301 to *\u0107 (/t\u0283/?). Proto-Indo-Iranian also merges PIE *e *a *o into a single *a vowel. So *k\u0301w\u00f3n > *\u0107w\u00e1n.\n\nThe shift to Sanskrit only involves two more changes : the softening of *\u0107 to *\u015b* and shifting *w to *v* ~~and seemingly irregular shortening of *\u0101~~.\n\nHence *\u0107w\u00e1n > *\u015bv\u00e1n*.", "created_utc": "1645234003.0", "edited": "1645272502.0", "id": "hxivfp6", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_svqveu", "parent_id": "t3_svqveu", "score": "19", "subreddit": "etymology", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qspe"}, {"author": "Henrywongtsh", "body": "Natively Trilingual Hong Kong-er here.

During which they got into an argument over how to pronounce old texts and poetry as you do. So they set out to make a golden standard for pronunciational and rhyming purposes, and thus birthed the Qieyun, which became the de facto standard for the rest of the Tang Dynasty.\n\n**Gendered pronouns**  \nSinitic languages tend to not distinguish between genders in their pronouns unlike European langs. However, during the New Cultural Movement (I think) in the Republican era, many intellects sought to emanate Western languages and created distinct gendered forms in the standard written form \u4ed6 and \u5979 (along with others like \u7942 for deities \u7260 for animals \u5b83 for inanimate things as well as second person variants) tho they remain homophones. Many modern local topolects also don\u2019t have this distinction, even in their written forms (see Cantonese \u4f62)\n\n**Fanqie**  \nA method for detonating how a character is pronounced like pioneered by Qieyun. Basically to describe a character two characters are written in the format XX\u5207. The former has the same initial as the transcribed character and the latter has the same rhyme (and usually tone). Using standard Mandarin as an example :\n\u770b (k\u0101n/k\u00e0n) could be Fanqie\u2019d as \u82e6(**k**u\u030c)\u809d(g**\u0101n**)\u5207. This is especially helpful in a character has no or only esoteric/rare homophones.\n\n**Huai checked tone**  \nI assume this is referring to Jianghuai Mandarin. Basically this is one of the only Mandarin varieties (if you don\u2019t count Jin) to preserve the coda stop on checked tones we talked about above, all others have lost the coda merged it into other tones\n\n**Literary/Vernacular**  \nFor many Sinitic languages, characters can sometimes have two distinct layers readings for colloquial (ie used in isolation or everyday situations) and literary (compounds, educated speak etc) situations. This is called Literary/Colloquial readings. In general, the Colloquial reading is what we will expect if we apply sound laws onto it, basically the native forms. The literary varieties are usually loaned from the prestige variety, mostly a type pf Mandarin (Hangzhou, Yangzhou, Nanjing, Beijing etc)\n\n**New Xiang**  \nXiang is usually divided into two types, new Xiang (in cities like Changsha) and old Xiang. Old Xiang is notable in being way more conservative with full blown Middle Chinese voiced stops and preserved checked codas. New Xiang, under heavy influence from Mandarin have lost most of these features.\n\n**New Period varieties**  \nNo idea\n\n**Old Chinese**  \nBasically the collective name for the hypothetical \u201cChinese\u201d of the Pre-Qieyun era, spoken from the Shang (~1000BC) all the Three Kingdoms (~250AD). Divided into a few periods and with many competing reconstructions and transcriptions like Schussler\u2019s, Zhengzhang\u2019s, Baxter-Sargart\u2019s etc.\n\n##Midnight zone\n\n**Northern Wu tone sandhi**\nNorthern Wu is very famous for its crazy and abhorrent sandhi system. Shanghainese, one of the tamer ones, full on deletes all non-phrase initial tones and spreads the first tone based on some patterns (OVERSIMPLIFICATION ALERT). Suzhou, on the other end of the complexity spectrum, cares about all tones in a phrase an thus have ridiculously complex systems where changing one tone in any word can change the surface realisation pf the whole phrase.\n\n**Min written in Latin**  \nI only know about Hokkien\u2019s Pe\u030dh-\u014de-j\u012b, used semi-commonly as an alternate to Chinese characters.\n\n**Para-Sinitic**  \n\u201cMainstream Sinitic\u201d (ie the big seven) is not the only Sinitic found on the tree. There is also Waxiang, Caijia and even Bai depending on your opinion (personally I agree with this classification after reading [Gong (2015)](https://www.soas.ac.uk/south-asia-institute/events/asia-beyond-boundaries/file125224.pdf#page94)) not to mention the extinct varieties like the Pre-Qieyun Centeal Old Chinese that forms the oldest Sinitic layer in Bai.\n\n**Language enclaves**  \nI think this means the many enclaving among Sinitic languages and with other non-Sinitic ones leading to very intense interations.\n\n**Wu-Min, Yue-Gan**  \nGotta love that Sinitic internal classifications.I know some have suggested a Min substrate in Wu and Yue (along with Hakka) is also decently commonly grouped with Gan.\n\n##The Abyss\n\n**Minjiang checked tone**  \nMinjiang is a variety of Chinese spoken in Sichuan. Traditionally classification as Mandarin , it is notable for its whacky checked tone stuff. Basically, the checked tone, despite losing the coda, not only has a distinct contour, but it also causes the preceding vowel to tense (so *a\u0294 > \u00e6\u02e7)\n\n**Proto-Min**  \nMin is generally accepted as the first major branching of Sinitic (sorry Waxiang and Caijia). Therefore there have been attempts to reconstruct this hypothetical Proto-language, most famously by Jerry Norman. Similar attempts have also been applied to other branches (most notably Northern Wu and Yue).\n\n**Old Shu**  \nAn extinct Sinitic languages spoken in Sichuan. It\u2019s speakers wained as the chaos of the Ming collapse led to pretty severe death in Sichuan followed by assimilation from Hubei, Hunan and Guangxi migrants as a repopulation strategy by the Qing emperor leading to mixing with Xiang and Southwest Mandarin to become modern Sichuanese. Some proposals do exist suggesting the aforementioned Minjiang is the last remanent of it.\n\n**Old Chu**  \nThe language of the Eastern Zhou (~700BC - 200BC) kingdom *Chu* located in the South of the Yangtze and the hypothetical language of *Chuci* a contemporary poetry/song complications to the more famous *Shijing*. Basically extinct, [some rebus gone wild tho](https://www.reddit.com/r/linguistics/comments/qd3u4u/how_to_write_%E4%B8%80_one_in_ancient_warring_states_chu/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)\n\n***q\u02b0la:\u0294**  \n\u864e \u201ctiger\u201d is commonly suggested to be an Austroasiatic loanword, reconstructed as above in Zhengzhang\u2019s system, it does bear resemblance to AA *kla\u0294 \u201ctiger\u201d.\n\n**Substrates**  \nCore China, particularly in the South, was not always Han inhabited and Sinitic speaking. During their Sinicisation, the various \u201cYue\u201d people, so they are called, left their marks on the Southern Sinitic languages, mainly on vocabulary but also on phonology (looking at you Yue/Ping checked tones) and even syntax. These substrate languages are commonly suggested to be Kra-Dai (specifically Tai), Austroasiatic and Hmong-Mien. There are also some evidence for particularly HM and AA substrate in Mainstream Sinitic, most notably \u6c5f, a loan from AA originally referring to the Yangtze river.\n\n**History of Gan**  \nMainly referring to the fact that it is the only branch to have dedicated [article to its History on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Gan_Chinese?wprov=sfti1)", "created_utc": "1644943732.0", "edited": "1644990829.0", "id": "hx1ys8j", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_st38n5", "parent_id": "t1_hx1you4", "score": "30", "subreddit": "linguisticshumor", "subreddit_id": "t5_2vwiq"}, {"author": "Henrywongtsh", "body": "##Surface level\n\n**Standard chinese and different varieties :**  \nPretty self explanatory, most things people know about Chinese\n\n##Top of the iceberg\n**Famous varieites**  :  \nMost Sinitic varieites people know about, also pretty self explanatory.\n\n**dialect vs language :**  \nAh, the classic Sinitic topolect question basically it is an argument on how to translate the term \u65b9\u8a00 \u201cregional speech\u201d which has been used to describe the Sinitic topolects.\n\n**South vs North :**  \nMost Sinitic branches are located south of the Yangtze with the entire North only occupied by one (or two depending on your position on Jin) branches.\n\n**Sinitic language :**  \nThe branch of Sino-tibetan\n\n##Transitional layer:\n\n**Liushu**\nThis is a classification scheme of Chinese characters.

The most famous example is definitely /\u027f/, detonating an apical vowel.\n\n**Seven languages**  \nTraditionally, Sinitic is divided into seven groups of **Fangyan**, often called languages despite many \u201cdialects\u201d being mutally unintelligible. Guan/Mandarin, Wu, Xiang, Gan, Min, Hakka and Yue.\n\n**\u8a9e\u7247**  \nTranslated as \u201cLanguage slice\u201d, basically an alternate name for the above seven (with some others depending on your opinion) that does not call them languages but clusters of languages.\n\n**Auish**  \nOther name for Southern Wu, also known as the \u201cdevil\u2019s language\u201d with the fun idiom of \u5929\u4e0d\u6015\u5730\u4e0d\u6015\u5c31\u6015\u6eab\u5dde\u4eba\u8b1b\u6eab\u5dde\u8a71 \u201cI fear no man, But that thing\u2026 *points to Wenzhou speaking Wenzhounese. It scares me\u201d. This is mainly due to its weird tone development along with standard Wu tone sandhi BS which includes : completely losing all evidence of checked codas and randomly inserting a glottal stop in \u201crising\u201d category of tones.\n\n**Topolectal vocabulary**  \nOther than pronunciational differences, topolects often have many differences in vocabulary. For example, the third person pronoun in Cantonese :  \n\u4f62 koey \u201che\u201d vs Mandarin \u4ed6 t\u0101\n\n**t\u00ea vs caa4, ch\u00e1**  \nAh, the good ol\u2019 *T/TS-* divide. Essentially, other than Min which generally shows an alveolar stop, most topolects reflect \u8336 \u201ctea\u201d with an affricate, showing how Min escaped the Middle Chinese palatalisation\n\n**Sino-Xenic pronunciation**  \nBack when China was THE cultural powerhouse of East Asia, nearby Japan, Korea and Vietnam (and to a lesser extent Zhuang and Bai) imported a lot of cultural stuff from China, including their logographic script. Oftentimes, the Chinese pronunciation will be rendered systematically into the language (ie there are regular correspondence between their character pronunciation(s) and Middle Chinese), called Sino-Xenic pronunciation.\n\n**Language Atlas of China :**  \nThis is the holy grail of Sinitic linguistics, a two-parter documenting the distribution of all Sinitic topolects (and other minority languages) across the Mainland and providing a classification scheme\n\n##Twilight zone\n\n**Mandarin k > t\u0255**  \nMost Mandarin varieties (along with Xiang, Jin, Hui and Wu) palatalise Middle Chinese *k before i-type rhymes into an affricate. Some, but not all also do the same with *ts, merging the two phonemes before i-type rhymesz\n\n**Dungan**  \nA variety of Mandarin spoken by Huis spread throughout Central Asia. It is notable as one of the few Sinitic languages to be primarily written in an alphabetical scripts, namely Cyrillic.\n\n**Jin, Ping, Hui**  \nOther than the big seven, there are many more proposed branches, these three are the most popular, separating them from Guan, Yue and Wu respectively.\n\n**d-type vs g-type possessives**  \nSinitic languages are divided in what their possessive start with, on one side, there are the ones that start with a dental stop (Mandarin and Xiang\u2019s \u7684); on the other, ones that start with a velar stop (Wu\u2019s \u500b; Yue\u2019s \u5605 etc)\n\n**Middle Chinese**  \nThis is the hypothetical language of the Qieyun-Guangyun tradition (we\u2019ll get to it later), also hailed to be the ancestor of all non-Min, Waxiang Sinitic.\n\n**Tuipu**  \nI assume this is \u63a8\u666e, which is the promotion of Standard Mandarin at the cost of local topolects, basically a classic case of standard forms snuffing out local languages.\n\n**Checked tone**  \nTraditional descriptions of Chinese tone divide them into four tone classes \u5e73\u4e0a\u53bb\u5165. The last on \u5165, often translated as \u201cchecked or entering\u201d is unusual because it is defined by the presence of the stop codas -*p -*t -*k in contrast to the null/glide/nasal codas of other tone categories. This situation is paralleled throughout Southeast Asia due to sprachbund. In modern Sinitic, basically only Yue, Hakka and Min actually somewhat preserve the distinction between the three codas (tho there are defo mergers and other development).

Modern Chinese topolects can also supply a pretty decent understanding of precise pronunciations tho the vowels can get muddy.", "created_utc": "1642084855.0", "edited": "1642085731.0", "id": "hshongm", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_s25g12", "parent_id": "t1_hsdf6mi", "score": "3", "subreddit": "etymology", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qspe"}, {"author": "Henrywongtsh", "body": "Even then you could include the root \u201ciron\u201d such as Chinese \u92fc\u9435 \u201chard iron\u201d", "created_utc": "1642050950.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hsg8znt", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_ruy91l", "parent_id": "t1_hsf9uyo", "score": "3", "subreddit": "conlangs", "subreddit_id": "t5_2red7"}, {"author": "Henrywongtsh", "body": "For specifically the North Eurasian type (ie Uralic, \u201cAltaic\u201d etc), it is likely that it is due to extreme strong initial stress bleaching subsequent vowel of all but one or two qualities.

Yup, usually it\u2019s mainly we can instantly recognise characters but recalling how to write them can be hard\n\n2. Usually, character inputs use one of three methods : Romanisation (including Pinyin, Yutping etc), Cangjie and Simplified Cangjie. Neither of them requires to remember the full form of the character. Romanisation systems only the pronunciation and character recognition. Cangjie requires I think memorisation of key strokes/radicals and Simplified only the first and last iirc. I mainly use IOS Pinyin, so I\u2019ll say from that POV. Again, Pinyin only requires remembering (approximate) the pronunciation and being able to recognise the character. Moreover, it has other helpful features like being able to guess compounds or idioms from only initials and yes, predictive text.\n\nHandwritten is available tho relatively rare. Handwritten can usually recognise a character if you have the general \u201cshape\u201d, it also has predictive text.\n\nMoreover, other than Cangjie, all of the methods show all possible characters/compounds that fit what you have imputed. If I type say \u201cshi zi\u201d into Pinyin, it will show me both \u7345\u5b50 \u77f3\u5b50 and other words that fit the bill.\n\n\n3. Are they really that common? Think of the last time you had to write \u201ctoothpaste\u201d or \u201cthumb\u201d in a piece of writing. \n\nAs for the words themselves :  \nToothpaste \u7259\u818f literally means \u201ctooth paste\u201d. The first character \u7259 \u201cteeth\u201d is fairly common and east to recognise so no problem with it. The second one, \u818f is much rarer, usually only found in compounds like \u77f3\u818f \u201cgypsum; plaster, lit. rock paste\u201d; \u6f64\u5507\u818f \u201clip balm, lit. moist lip paste\u201d; \u85e5\u818f \u201cointment; lit. medicine paste\u201d. Most of them are not terribly common, especially writing, so recalling \u818f can be hard.\n\nThumb \u62c7\u6307\u2019s second character \u6307 is reasonably common, meaning \u201cto point\u201d in addition to \u201cfinger\u201d. The first character on the other hand, is pretty much found in this context. \u201cThumb\u201d isn\u2019t something you write very often so recalling it can be hard.", "created_utc": "1641739565.0", "edited": "1641739875.0", "id": "hrx2tqb", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_rzstbg", "parent_id": "t3_rzstbg", "score": "28", "subreddit": "ChineseLanguage", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qyz1"}, {"author": "Henrywongtsh", "body": "Esa?

Rice, or more specifically rice porridge, turned out to be a big hit among the highland nobles.

All other unassigned segments gets low\n\nTo see it in action, let\u2019s take the words h\u00e1shi \u201cchopsticks\u201d, hash\u00ed \u201cbridge\u201d and hashi \u201cedge\u201d in conjunction to the clitic \u201cga\u201d whose tonal behaviour acts as if it belongs to the preceding word.\n\n> h\u00e1shi-ga  \nh\u00e1shiga  \nh\u00e1sh\u00ecg\u00e0\n\n> hash\u00ed-ga  \nhash\u00edga  \nh\u00e0sh\u00edg\u00e0\n\n> hashi-ga  \nhashiga \u0301  \nhash\u00edg\u00e1  \nh\u00e0sh\u00edg\u00e1\n\nThe main thing here is to not think that Southeast Asian tone = tone in general. Southeast Asian tones like those of Mandarin, Vietnamese and Thai are in general quite atypical in the wider tone world and very rare outside SEA as well as being very different from the autosegmental Subsaharan African, Papuan and Amerind tones.", "created_utc": "1634020476.0", "edited": "1634022281.0", "id": "hgbraii", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_q62gyw", "parent_id": "t1_hgbiwku", "score": "9", "subreddit": "asklinguistics", "subreddit_id": "t5_2u7nj"}, {"author": "Henrywongtsh", "body": "/t\u0255/", "created_utc": "1633993833.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hgacju5", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_q6156n", "parent_id": "t3_q6156n", "score": "12", "subreddit": "linguisticshumor", "subreddit_id": "t5_2vwiq"}, {"author": "Henrywongtsh", "body": "Is Proto-Tungusic still considered to be palatal-harmony or has ATR gained the upper hand?", "created_utc": "1633961476.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hg8ao11", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_q5tdep", "parent_id": "t3_q5tdep", "score": "1", "subreddit": "linguistics", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhos"}, {"author": "Henrywongtsh", "body": "Not sure if I understand the prompt but :\n\n##Proto-form\n\n###*ul\u00e6\u0301\u03c7i\n\n\u00e6 > a; \u03c7 > h  \n- u\u02c8lahi  \nUnstressed i > \u026a  \n   - ulah\u026a\n\nV- > \u00d8-; \u00e6 > e\n- \u02c8le\u03c7i  \nstressed e > je > j\u0259; unstressed i > e  \n   - \u02c8lj\u0259\u03c7e  \nlj > \u028e > d\u0292  \n       - d\u0292\u0259\u03c7e\n\nReconstruction notes : the acute marker is stress", "created_utc": "1633960069.0", "edited": "1633961334.0", "id": "hg87ps2", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_q5uyjr", "parent_id": "t3_q5uyjr", "score": "2", "subreddit": "conlangs", "subreddit_id": "t5_2red7"}, {"author": "Henrywongtsh", "body": "Agglutinative and fusional languages are ultimately about how many meanings does one morpheme have.
