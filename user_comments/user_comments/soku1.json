I think my Anki % was hovering aeound 30%, which made me hate anki even more because I had to go through so many failed reviews. Incredibly frustrating. Korean has so many sound hat sound the same to the untrained ear. Luckily, I got through this. 4 months later I'm at a comfortable 81% for mature cards and 85% in general. Thank God. \n\n2. Grammmar complexity - Personally, I hate doing grammar exercises and studying grammar. Part of the reason I chose Korean is because it has similar grammar to Japanese (i.e. I wouldn't gave to study it too much.) Well, that's true (somewhat). I very rarely don't understand the grammar of a sentence in Korean, but like you said - there's more moving parts so it's harder for me to reproduce on my own.\n\n3. Studying vs Immersion - I did all my hard studying in the first 3 - 4 months and I hated every moment of it. I've been comfortable with Japanese so long I forgot it was HELL learning in the beginning, so I forgot how much starting a new language you don't understand much in sucks. In the first months I was looking up almost every grammar point or vocab I encountered in my immersion. (I was using frequency lists, but still, when you're kevel is that low you're still looking up so many words.) It was around month 5 - 6 that my listenining, grammar and vocab started being good enough to where I don't have to pause a video every 2 seconds to look something up and where the fun immersion begun.

For me, I used the \u541b\u306e\u540d\u306f book, and then an unabridged audiobook of it in Korean. I decided to use Japanese to learn from because the sentence structure with Korean is similar so I don't have to scramble too much to match the written meaning to spoken Korean; it's already in a similar order. \n\n1. Read the book in your NL (if you already know the book well you can skip this part). \n2. Read the text along with the audio in your TL (this gets you used to how the audio sounds spoken at native speed snd match that with your TL text). \n3. Read the text in your NL while listening to your TL\n (Do this step as many times as you need to, or until you get bored, then move on to the next book)\n\nStep 3 is where most of the learning happens. I've been able to pick up an insane amount of Korean in a relatively short amount if time  using this method. And my listening comprehension has shot through the roof. If you do this with enough books, you can listen to audiobooks in your TL that you've never read or listened to and still have pretty good comprehension without any text to look at. It's intensive but it works. And ofc if you can listen to audiobooks without text you are well on your way to understanding most tv shows, YouTube videos etc \n\n\nOne interesting result is: you know how people say subvocalizing while reading  in a language you don't have strong listening comprehension in will mess up your accent? This doesnt really happen. Because I'm reading in a different language then the audio. Theres no Korean text for me to mispronounce in my head. Or if there is Korean text, I'm listening to the Korean audio as well.\n\nImo, this really boosts readings benefits (vocab and grammar structures are easier to check and internalize) and mimics readings' weaknesses for a beginner.

I get a lot input; I read a lot, I listen a lot. I don\u2019t do a lot of output. I have relatively little speaking experience (to other people that is). I wish I could speak a lot better, and I need tons more speaking practice, but I surprise myself sometimes at the things I\u2019m able to produce spontaneously and I owe a lot of this to shadowing. I don\u2019t talk to other people in Japanese too often but I have done the full unit of Glossika Japanese (3k sentences) and the Shadowing: Let\u2019s Speak Japanese series. These really helped with my intonation, accent, and fluency at saying the things I know how to say (i.e. I don\u2019t trip up and get tongue tied as much I used to). And they really help in internalizing collocations that I can readily use in conversation.\n\nI\u2019ll tell you about some experiences I had speaking last year:\n\nIn October I was in Taiwan with my girlfriend. We went to this place known for inspiring the setting for Miyazaki\u2019s movie \u201cSpirited Away\u201d. Naturally, there are TONS of Japanese tourists (well, they\u2019re all over Taiwan, really, but they concentrate there heavily). I heard a lot of Japanese, so I was able to strike up a conversation with a few people. And what surprised me is that many of the phrases and collocations I had been practicing just flowed out of my mouth very smoothly. I actually thought shadowing wasn\u2019t helping too much beforehand, but then I got there and something just switched on. I was able to carry on a 10 minute conversation about more than just the weather and the food with one older woman. We were talking about why we came to Taiwan and the popularity of Taiwan as destination for Japanese tourists and what not. I didn\u2019t speak perfectly, but it was pretty adequate. \n\n\nNext, we were hiking on this little island off the south coast of Taiwan and I heard some Japanese, which surprised me. I told my gf (who does not speak Japanese; she\u2019s Taiwanese) what they were saying. Then she was talking to me in Chinese, and I wasn\u2019t quite getting all of it so I was like \u201cUhh, yeah I\u2019m not really getting you.\u201d The guy speaking Japanese said in Chinese to my girlfriend \u201cHe looks like he\u2019s not getting what you were saying.\u201d So long story short, the guy was a Taiwanese photographer who went to Japan as an exchange student and he often flies back and forth between the two countries. It ended up as a funny group conversation where him and I would talk in Japanese, my gf would jokingly ask him what we were talking about in Chinese, they would speak in Chinese, and I would jokingly ask him what they were talking about in Japanese, and then me and my gf would speak in English. I was able to carry on my side of the conversation pretty well (with mistakes obviously). \n\nThe last is my nephew (who is half American and half Japanese) who lives in Japan came over for Christmas. We basically spoke Japanese the whole time and I was able too, eventually, explain the process of entering esl classes in college to him. He\u2019s graduating high school over there and wants to come to college here in America. I know I wasn\u2019t speaking in the most natural way, and probably sounded a bit like baby talk in some places, but he got what I was saying. That was probably the hardest time I\u2019ve ever had speaking Japanese\n\nSo...yeah.
