At the beginning, the grammar is fairly simple, and vocab is completely foreign but fairly straightforward. The characters take some getting used to, but that's about the only thing that's really difficult at the beginning.\n\nBy the time you get to an intermediate level, the grammar is completely foreign. It's typologically similar to English, but that's about it. Even something as basic as marking time and aspect with verbs correctly is something people generally don't get a handle on until they're moving well toward upper intermediate.\n\nReading is a challenge. Even in a language like Hungarian (studied for a year and lived there, probably my next best non-indo-european language), encountering a new word isn't nearly the issue it is in Chinese. You know how to say it, you know what it sounds like. If you can get it from context, you've learned a new word. If it's composed of parts you know, you know that right off the bat. With Chinese, you can make some guesses about pronunciation or meaning from character components. You might be right, but you can't count on it. You have to look it up. It's a little easier now because you can just write it on your smartphone, but it's still more finnicky than looking up a word written in an alphabet. If it's unfamiliar, you might not even know where the word boundaries are. If half the sentence doesn't make sense, it might just be some classical Chinese thrown in for good measure. Imagine English if every literary reference were in a different language, and it were way more common. Or maybe you know all the words and are hitting the cultural idiot barrier, because western influence is a lot more recent and less extensive than in a language like Turkish or Hungarian or Indonesian. Loan words are rare, and loan translations aren't always obvious. And that's assuming you've learned the 5000 or so characters you need to read something like a newspaper. That's about as many as a high school senior knows. Good luck reading academic papers.\n\nMore informal language is a bit easier. The fellas probably won't be throwing too much classical chinese at you in wechat, but you know how Chinese has a lot of homophones? If the ime doesn't pick the right one for them, they're probably writing the wrong character. Now those imes are getting a lot better, but it's still an issue. Native speakers will read it like you read me misusing they're and their. As a learner in a language where the writing system has limited phonetic content, you might not have such an easy time. Also, they will use set phrases from classical chinese, chengyu, and you probably need to be familiar with a couple hundred of them.\n\nFormal spoken Chinese has most of those issues that aren't character related, and informal spoken Chinese has huge dialectical variation, and that's just within Mandarin. Tones are one of the things western learners struggle with the most, and they're also one of the features that change the most between different areas. Remember sh/x/s and ch/q/c? Now that you're no longer a beginner, turns out half the people you interact with don't make those distinctions, at least not all of them. They might merge -ai and -ei. For a language that's already very context-dependent, the added ambiguity is just fuel on the fire.\n\nI probably disagree with you less than my rant makes it sound. Most of those things are not unique to Chinese, and none of them are insurmountable. I wouldn't even go so far as to call Chinese hard.  It's just a lot to learn, and it's a lot harder to wing it than it is with a language where you have an alphabet, recognize more words, and have more in common culturally with the speakers. The kind of challenges you have with Chinese are a lot more like the challenges you have with the other very difficult languages like Japanese, Chinese, Korean, or Arabic than something like Hungarian where the biggest challenge is the linguistic dissimilarity.\n\nAnd ultimately, it's mostly about motivation. Pretty much no source would say that German is easier than Spanish, but I learned it way faster, because I had a pressing reason to. I can certainly imagine someone finding Chinese as easy or learning it as quickly as a language they begrudgingly learned, but generally speaking, I think the FSI's got it pretty close to right in comparison to other unrelated languages.", "created_utc": "1640922899.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hqn1fz0", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_rs66ky", "parent_id": "t1_hqm9v7q", "score": "2", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "nonneb", "body": "I found it took me about four times as long to make equivalent progress in Chinese to what I had made in Spanish or German, and I had more language learning experience by that point.

Not necessarily, but it certainly takes longer to learn for most people.\n\nI suppose it also depends on what you mean by outside of your language family, as Chinese is one of the few non-indo-european languages that is fairly widely studied so comparisons are limited, but it's definitely up there with Japanese, Korean, and the other languages that take the longest for an English speaker.
