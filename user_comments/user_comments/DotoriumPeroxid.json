If you lock up into a corner and hit a guy, your fate shouldn't be determined by whether you cost them a front wing, or DNF'ed them.\n\nThe actual offending incident is you causing the collision, not the consequences of the collision. As a general rule, this is more fair to me than anything else. Your punishment is decided by the severity of your mistake, not by the severity of whatever outside factors exacerbate the incident. Say you knock someone into sausage kerbs and their car gets fucked up, if you took them out *exactly* the same way into a place without any kerbs, their car won't get fucked up as bad. In either case, your actual fuck-up was *colliding and knocking the other driver off track*, not the consequences of that.\n\nProvided you are acting in good faith, i.e. you aren't deliberately causing collisions. Even a dickhead like George, in that case, is acting in \"good faith\" in that, while he's a prick who causes collisions and shoves the blame, he doesn't deliberately set out to crash others, he just has genuine lapses of judgement/driver errors that cause the collisions, more than maybe other drivers.\n\nAnd of course there can be edge cases, like if Max deliberately took out Lewis in Abu Dhabi to cause a double DNF and secure the championship that way (or if Lewis crashed Max out to secure it for himself), you can argue that the aggressor should be punished outside just the race because reasons *beyond* that one race went into it, and it wasn't just an incident inside the race, but one with overarching motifs for the championship.\n\nBut that'd be an edge case, not the rule.\n\nThe rule, to me, is fairer as is than if you decided to penalize cars worse depending on how big the damages are.\n\n>I use lock up because that is just something easy to point out that isn't usually a racing incident.\n\nAs for the lock ups, I still kinda don't get it. Drivers are penalized on the regular for collisions caused by locking up. That is one of the ways in which collisions happen the most. F1 drivers won't just start deliberately taking others out with malicious intent after taking so many years to get into F1, so obviously, if a collision happens, it is due to a genuine mistake or lapse in judgement by one of the parties. That can be a mistake like a lockup, it can be an error in racecraft (like Stroll), or anything like that. It doesn't detract from the actual punishable incident of causing a collision.

Fuck off. 13/50 is bullshit from the ground up, and if you had a single genuine bone in your body, you would have done the proper research and applying a critical outlook to actually dissect that statistic for what it *really* shows.\n\nBut since I currently have nothing better to do on my Tuesday night:\n\nFirst of all, most people will claim that statistic says something along the lines of \"Despite accounting for 13% of the population, black people account for 50% of crime\", that sentence alone contains multiple mistakes attributed to a deliberate misrepresentation [*of the actual FBI crime study referenced*](https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2018/crime-in-the-u.s.-2018/tables/table-43)\n\nIt doesn't state anything about *commited* crime, the study shows *arrests made*. That includes false arrests, it excludes crimes commited for which there were no arrests. So, at face value, it doesn't say black people commit x% of crime, it shows how many *arrests* they constitute. And the total percentage comes to ~27%, not 50 or 52. Already quite a big drop from what racists claim. But, of course, you're gonna see that and still think \"well, 13% of people and 27% of arrests still shows something\", and you're right. Except it doesn't show that black people are predisposed to crime. It shows that black people are targeted more when it comes to police activity. And we *know* that to be true, because we know that police activity is higher in low income areas, and in more ethnic areas.\n\nIf you have 10 cops driving around a black neighbourhood, and 2 cops in a white one, if 4 crimes happen in each of them, the cops in the ethnic neighbourhood are much more likely to be making 4 arrests while the other cops will at most be making 2, and that is assuming that every arrest actually corresponds to a crime commited, so when you factor in false arrests and false guilty pleas by the disportortionately more arrested population, it will make quite the big difference.\n\nThat statistic also excludes about a third of the data that went into it based on \"unidentifiable race\", remember, that statistic is comprised of data that was *voluntarily* submitted by individual police departments, who are not obligated to submit all data truthfully. So there is ample room for manipulation, or if we assume incompetence over malice, there is room for omission by sheer ignorance, which makes the actual findings in the FBI study laughable at best for anyone who intends to earnestly use it to make a statement about racial dynamics.\n\nAlso: There are plenty of resources out there that critically deal with this study to dissect what it means, many of them probably better than I am doing here, so if you are invested, go look them up.\n\nAnd, lastly, most importantly, even if all these magical assumptions were true, and black people *did* commit disproportionately more crime, that would still not be an indicator that they are genetically or culturally predisposed to it.\n\nCrime is mostly a socio-economic issue; in most cases crime is a recourse taken by people out of socio-economic circumstances, and not like people love to believe purely a consequence of evil moral character, so you need to bring in the socio-economic dimension into the entire thing as well.\n\nWhich parts of the population are statistically in worse position socio-economically? Ethnic areas are predominantly more affected than white neighbourhoods. Which means crime will naturally congregate more in those neighbourhoods, not out of some genetic predisposition or anything like that, but because in those areas, crime is more likely to be a necessity for people who struggle to make a living.\n\nThis also feeds into a very nasty feedback loop, like I said above, higher police activity in these areas means they will detect more crime there, which gives them more reason for higher police activity, which makes them detect more crime, rinse and repeat, it's a self-affirming loop. A self-affirming loop that completely forgoes trying to reform the system to work on the systemic issues that *cause* these people to resort to crime.\n\nInstead, crime is considered a moral failure of the individual (Which I'm not saying is always wrong, a lot of crime *is* moral failure of a person who chooses wrongly)  but any systemic component that goes into that is completely ignored. Crime is not just a failure of an individual, it is also a consequence of environmental factors, which includes the countless systemic injustices.\n\nPulling a 13/50 is the quickest way to tell the entire audience that you have the critical thinking skills of a sloth, or are gullible and lazy enough to take what people tell you as gospel without questioning. Be better. Or go back to /pol/ if you wanna peddle that shit.\n\nEdit: Bonus: The national registry of exonerations of the US recently published findings that show that black people are erroneously convicted at a rate of about *seven times* more than white people. And that's *convictions*, not arrests.

FF14 is great when it comes to that, honestly, you just need to get through the entire fucking story if you want to reach the current endgame raids. That is a significant time sink, even if you were to skip most of the story. There are jump potions and story skips you can buy in the cash shop, but that would be a huge investment for a game you don't know if you're gonna like.\n\nThat said, if you do reach the endgame, the raiding is really fun, and provides a good enough challenge to the average player. Disregard some of the comments here talking about how \"hard\" it is to find people to do it with, that's fucking BS. Yeah, if you were Pugging raids with people from party finder, you will have plenty of situations where people will be dragging the whole party down, and make you want to throw your screen at them, but pugging isn't always bad. And getting a static or a community to raid with that is actually determined to improve is relatively easy. A raid consists of 8 people, I figure it's significantly easier to put 8 competent people together than the amount you need for a WoW raid.\n\nWhen it comes to dungeons, FF has honestly degraded in quality. There are fewer dungeons coming per patch, so fewer per expansion, and they became increasingly more linear over time. They're fun to run the first 2-3 times, and then they become very stale for most of them.\n\nIf you're looking for a good story, I think FF14 offers an *amazing* story, with the major caveat that it's held back by ARR. In ARR, the base game, so levels 1-50, the story is being told *ridiculously* badly. Cutscenes are bland and static, barely anything is voiced, and the quests are unengaging. There is a big slog of quests to sit through before you hit Heavensward, the first expansion. From HW on out, the story gets really good. But of course that means you will have to sink a significant amount of time into the first part to even get there. Some people don't have that time, and some don't want to put that much time in just to maybe have the pay-off after. Plus, class gameplay is equally stale and boring in the early levels. Because the maximum amount of buttons you have at max level doesn't change a lot across expansions (old skills get removed or revamped and such, to prevent button bloat), it means you now have ~30 skills spread across 90 levels, where a few years ago it would have been 30 skills spread out across 60 levels. The difference is noticeable, and most classes take a lot of time to really start feeling good.\n\nMy verdict is just... see for yourself, you can play the entire base game and Heavensward as part of the free trial, so you can always give it a go and quit if it's not to your liking.", "created_utc": "1664884034.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ir069je", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_xvau9v", "parent_id": "t3_xvau9v", "score": "36", "subreddit": "MMORPG", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qlxw"}, {"author": "DotoriumPeroxid", "body": "> every fight devolves into mashing the same 3 or 4 buttons with very little strategy or variety\n\n>If you find the early game skill rotation/GCD unengaging, then you probably won't have much fun in the rest of the game.\n\nTo be fair, I think most players who ended up enjoying the game found the early game slow GCD unengaging.\n\n\"If you don't like x, you will not like when it completely stops being x\" is kind of a weird criticism. The game absolutely evolves out of being 3-4 button mashing. Well, unless you play Healer in non-savage content, but I am assuming you mean DPS classes? The combat goes way up in engagement, in skill expression, and in complexity.\n\nThe early game is absolute boring and repetitive, it borders on unbearable depending on what class you are leveling. But the way you worded it makes me think you never got past that early hurdle, where the classes actually get the whole kit at their disposal.\n\nDon't get me wrong, the fact that you even have to endure the early game slog is definitely a big drawback of FF14, but saying that OP won't enjoy the rest?

When the movies came out, people were basically always gonna dislike Garfield because he wasn't Tobey-Spidey, and he was judged not by his ability to play Spider-Man, but by whether he could be like Tobey Maguire, which... duh, he couldn't.\n\nSince then, people have gone back and found new appreciation for Garfield in the role, without looking at him as a Tobey Maguire stand-in.", "created_utc": "1663969875.0", "edited": "1664013183.0", "id": "ipn9zoq", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_xltf9m", "parent_id": "t1_ipkzv2b", "score": "4", "subreddit": "moviescirclejerk", "subreddit_id": "t5_2tfdo"}, {"author": "DotoriumPeroxid", "body": "Unnamed, or Unarmed?

Jimmy always chose the easy way, he skips therapy because it would be work and emotional labour. He skips processing the grief of Chuck's death, and instead develops an entire identity as a coping mechanism. He never processes being responsible for Howard's death.\n\nYes, he condemns himself to life in prison, but he does the one thing that the entire show shows time and time again he couldn't do: He actually deals with his grief, he actually grows a conscience and chooses to do the right thing, even if it's very late to do so. He addresses the wrongdoings he's done, and so does the one thing he can to get the only person in the entire world who might have a little faith in him to not give up on him. It's not about redeeming himself, it's about him acknowledging that he can still do the right thing, and he doesn't have to con himself into even more mistakes.\n\nHe's by no means redeemed, but it shows Kim that a part of Jimmy still remains, and it isn't all taken over by Saul Goodman, a husk of an identity, with no personality and no conscience. The Gene scenes this season made it plenty obvious that he was an absolute scumbag with no moral compass.\n\nYou can dislike the ending, that's fine, part of me was disappointed he didn't con his way out one last time, but calling what he does \"random\" is a clear admission that you *don't* get what any of it was about. There were clear character motivations going into the finale, and there is clear setup all throughout the episode + the season that shape that motivation.\n\n*Surely* a film character with a good core deep down, but a history of egocentrism and self-serving life, choosing self-sacrifice to do the right thing isn't a foreign concept to you, right?

You'll notice people want to be called Black Americans more than African Americans, because the former describes the situation they experience more accurately.\n\nBlack Americans share a certain culture due to a shared experience they make because of being black, not because of being of African descent or any sort of traditions. Of course, there are also many black people in America who still have a connection to their country of origin, and also connect to that culture, but that would then be Nigerian American culture, for example, or Ghanaian American culture. Things like that. And the person of Nigerian ancestry and of Ghanaian will still share a cultural experience they made as black people in the US.\n\nAlso, \"culture\" is not an insular thing with clearly defined borders. There can be a Black American culture and a XYZ-heritage culture at the same time - so two Black Americans can share cultural aspects pertaining to being black, but also diverge in aspects such as different upbringing, state, or other things. \n\n> that culture is derived from the place of origin\n\nAnd don't conflate the terms culture and ethnicity - it can get a bit confusing when one doesn't know exactly how to differentiate the terms, but what you describe there in the other reply, is ethnicity. Ethnicity is based on origin and shared history. Culture can be related to *anything*. Culture also comes from things like sexuality, class, region, and many other things. Culture is an extremely broad term, pinning culture down to \"place of origin\" is plain wrong. Internet culture is a thing, for example (with many subcultures, even), and \"Internet\" is certainly not a place of origin. Golfing culture probably exists among golfers, and I dare say that \"Golf Course\" is only a place of origin for the few unlucky people to be born on a golf course.\n\nIf a black person is born in Germany and grows up as a German, they're ethnically German.\n\nEthnicity also impacts culture, of course. But their cultural experience will differ from a white German's, so you can still say that there is a Black German culture comprised of unique experiences that only a black person in Germany would understand, which white Germans wouldn't. There can be a pan-German culture as an overarching term *and* a black German culture pertaining specifically to black people's unique cultural experience. *And* you can also add other cultures that a person can be part of, like what state in Germany or what region they are from.\n\nIMO thinking of someone as being *a* culture is thinking in the wrong direction - a person isn't *of* black culture. Culture is a shared experience, and you can share many distinct experiences with many different groups of people.

It mischaracterizes DID by implying Elliot is the \"real\" personality, because yeah, in a DID system, every alter is a full personality, no one is more real than another.\n\nSure, the host personality is often the 'original' one before the dissociation, but that's like trying to say which shard in a fragmented plate (a common analogy to understanding DID is the shattered plate as a personality that fragments in result to trauma) is the \"original\" piece. It doesn't matter.\n\nYou can say it's almost a coincidence that the host gets to have the name of the system in most cases, and thus be the perceived \"real\" persona.\n\nAs for how the show ends: I think it can be seen both as the alters taking a backseat to let the Elliot persona front, because he's supposed to be the one who represents the system the most, and the other alters are still around to step in when their role becomes important. So Mr. Robot to be the protector, or MM to be Elliot's rage if something happened again to the body that needs one of them to resurface.\n\nOr, and this is my speculation, perhaps the Mastermind alter integrated with the host personality. Maybe some of the other alters also integrated, but we can't know. But I think it's not too far-fetched that the MM and Elliot alters ended up fusing in the end of the show - since it seems MM split and was born sometime around the start of the show, during or around the rage incident that got Elliot his court mandated therapy in the first place. I can see that the culmination of the show also features a re-integration of those alters into one. Maybe only MM integrated, maybe they all did, either way, I can see the finale as a process of integration now that Elliot, and the alters, are willing to embrace life much more healthily.\n\nBut: This means the idea that the \"real\" Elliot who regains control at the end would be the same as the \"real\" Elliot the alter, is very misleading. A fusion of alters is, as far as I am aware, an entirely new alter, an entirely new person, just based on a merge of two previously existing alters. So if the host integrated with the other alters again, it created a \"new\" version of an alter, who is conveniently also named Elliot.\n\nThe language used for DID is often very prone to misunderstandings, and the way identity works in society doesn't help that.", "created_utc": "1657232027.0", "edited": "1657235135.0", "id": "if9kufs", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_vsx94n", "parent_id": "t3_vsx94n", "score": "1", "subreddit": "MrRobot", "subreddit_id": "t5_37dnc"}, {"author": "DotoriumPeroxid", "body": "He dead", "created_utc": "1657228145.0", "edited": "False", "id": "if9bn7m", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_vtq925", "parent_id": "t3_vtq925", "score": "58", "subreddit": "MrRobot", "subreddit_id": "t5_37dnc"}, {"author": "DotoriumPeroxid", "body": "People really want every media they enjoy to be run into the ground with unnecessary sequels and what-not\n\nSometimes the consumer really doesn't know what they want", "created_utc": "1657222648.0", "edited": "False", "id": "if8x84n", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_vti3j2", "parent_id": "t1_if7wyph", "score": "4", "subreddit": "DarlingInTheFranxx", "subreddit_id": "t5_3obo9"}, {"author": "DotoriumPeroxid", "body": "Because why would we need any of those in a complete story?", "created_utc": "1657208521.0", "edited": "False", "id": "if7wmdx", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_vti3j2", "parent_id": "t3_vti3j2", "score": "22", "subreddit": "DarlingInTheFranxx", "subreddit_id": "t5_3obo9"}, {"author": "DotoriumPeroxid", "body": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/comments/vrkfu4/when_you_see_scams_that_have_been_posted_here_ten/", "created_utc": "1657193844.0", "edited": "False", "id": "if713d9", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_vt4k7y", "parent_id": "t1_if6z5ev", "score": "11", "subreddit": "Scams", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qrt0"}, {"author": "DotoriumPeroxid", "body": "> Where this game is a lot weaker than other titles in the series is story and characters.\n\nWhich tbh has always been arguable.\n\nI love how Square tackles political themes in most FF titles, and FF12's entire story *is* a political drama.

The entire game engine is a broken mess that I am honestly surprised that it even holds together most days.\n\n> Now you can not like the story and not like the game but pretty much everything that just objectively sucks about other MMOs isn't in FFXIV their not trying to keep you logged in for metrics\n\nIdk about you, but I would call \"becoming increasingly more formulaic in your content release structures and the way the content itself is designed\" something that objectively sucks about many MMOs, and FFXIV is very guilty of that. Ever since Stormblood, every major patch has followed exactly the same scheme across the expansions, and while it may have its benefits, it's also extremely boring, the formulaic nature really gets to you after 3 expansions of suffering through it.\n\nAnother thing that unquestionably sucks about FF, and again, I say that as someone who loves the game, is that job design is becoming more and more dull. The PvP reworked jobs have more class identity than the jobs do in PvE. I understand how hard balancing was in ARR/Heavensward with classes like Warrior pulling 30% ahead of every other tank in DPS charts, (and how difficult it is to provide a balanced experience for both casual and hardcore players) but the current approach to class design of reducing classes down into reskins of one another with minor flavor additions is insulting.\n\nHealers' kits and tanks' kits are so cookie cutter between each other that it just feels like you're playing a class with no identity, and in the case of healers, no difficulty either. Cause that's another sore point: Healer in non-savage content is the most boring thing imaginable; Healer in savage is like playing a different game (same goes for tanks tbh), *and even then*, your goal is just \"how do I use my 1 single dps spell as often as possible without letting someone die\". Healer design has taken steps back every expansion after HW, and the same goes for tank design, and lately for DPS design too. Melee DPS are becoming increasingly more dull.\n\nAnd that's not all the flaws the game has. I think it's by far one of the best MMOs we've had, especially at its peak, but I would absolutely understand why someone refrains from calling it \"objectively the best\" *because* of the issues it has, that may be better in other games.", "created_utc": "1656444007.0", "edited": "1656461027.0", "id": "ie3cb5b", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_vmpccr", "parent_id": "t1_ie33e7o", "score": "0", "subreddit": "MMORPG", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qlxw"}, {"author": "DotoriumPeroxid", "body": "Tbh it's one of the most unproductive questions in the MMO community.\n\nThere is no *the* best.
