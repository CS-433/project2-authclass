Sure, it's not as good as the first game, but I think it has a lot of merits as well. It has an amazing soundtrack, for starters. The ability to quickly switch between two weapons was also very welcome. I also really like the level design overall. It has just so many different levels, such as the insanity of The Freakshow, the creepy atmosphere of Greenwich Observatory or Wulfrum Hall. And are the bosses really hard? Only the Count and the final boss is hard if you don't know what to do.\n\nPerhaps I'm biased because I grew up playing this game, but I really like it. The only thing I dislike is the story, since I think it's just really stupid at times. There's also the fact that I know this game so well that I rarely even get hit, so the fact that the healing pools don't respawn doesn't matter to me anymore. However, I do remember it being a bit annoying when I was worse at playing this game.\n\nStill, there are a lot of hidden healing pools if you come back to earlier levels with the Dan Hand ability, so it's really not that bad. The Museum has a secret area accessible only with the Dan Hand ability, and it has like two healing pools and various energy vials, allowing you to fill up around six life bottles or so.

If he's not the only one, then I suppose the eligible seers will have to discuss among themselves and somehow vote on how they want magic to change. \n\nSecondly, as stated at various times by Tedd, he wants magic to be available to everyone, but that runs counter to the Will of Magic, which wants magic to be known only by a select few.

He might be selfish and think only about how magic would work best for *him* and his immediate entourage, but not for others.

Basically, there are historic reasons for why Swiss German isn't considered a separate language. Despite some Swiss German dialects being possibly more difficult to understand for Germans (especially from the North of Germany) than Dutch, which is indeed a separate language that happens to be close to German, Swiss Germans learn High German (or Standard German) in school and are exposed to it through media. \n\nThis unique situation is often described as a \"medial diglossia\". A diglossia is a society that uses two languages for different purposes. In a diglossia there is a high variety (Standard German in this case) and a low variety (Swiss German in this case). What this means is that all Swiss Germans understand and speak Standard German. But they speak their dialect among themselves in everyday situations, but in formal settings such as schools and certain news broadcasts on TV, Standard German is spoken. However, there have been some people who argued for Swiss German being a separate language. It's just not very widely accepted. And there's also the fact that only German is one of the official languages of Switzerland, not Swiss German. \n\nAs a speaker of Swiss German, I can also tell you that while the pronunciation is vastly different from Standard German, most of its vocabulary is shared with Standard German, with only a few exceptions. The grammar is also somewhat different from Standard German, but whether it is different enough for it to be considered a different language is highly debatable. The main problem is that \"Swiss German\" as a dialect doesn't really exist, since it actually consists of a huge variety of dialects that just happen to be spoken in the German part of Switzerland and be (mostly) mutually intelligible with each other. Unlike with English or Standard German, there is no standardized writing system, which once again makes it more difficult for it to be recognized as a \"language\". \n\nThis stands in stark contrast to Portuguese and Spanish. They are spoken by completely different populations and just happen to be somewhat mutually intelligible because of them closely related linguistically speaking. Their written languages are mostly mutually intelligible, although there maybe a few words that are either unfamiliar or mean something else in the other language. The spoken languages, however, are very different. They are not really mutually intelligible, unless you speak very slowly and even then speaking slowly will not help if they use a different word for the same concept. A Portuguese speaker will not understand what the Spanish word \"despacio\" (slow) means because in Portuguese the corresponding word is \"devagar\". However, I cannot say that it is necessarily harder to understand Portuguese as Spanish speaker than for a German to understand Swiss German. \n\nUltimately, what is a language or not often comes down to official recognition more than mutual intelligibility. Luxembourgish is a language, despite possibly being easier to understand for Germans than Swiss German. Why is it a language? Because the Luxembourgish people chose to make it one. It's all about official recognition in the end. In linguistic terms, Swiss German might just as well be considered a separate language. But officially, it is not. Spanish and Portuguese have had their own distinct literary cultures for centuries, which is not the case for Swiss German and Standard German. Spanish is the official language of Spain, while Portuguese is the official language of Portugal. And that's why they're really different languages. Because they are completely separated and have been separated for centuries, unlike Swiss German and Standard German, where everyone who speaks the former also speaks the latter.
