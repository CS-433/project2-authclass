There's a collection out there of millions of games free to download from the fox go server, and the computer would analyze each one for 'critical' positions.\n\nA 'critical' position, as I'm using it, means there is a large group of stones that could die if the wrong move is made. You would find this position with katago in a few steps for each position:\n\n* check the life/death status of all the groups on the board\n* the player whos turn it is passes\n* check the life/death status of all the groups on the board\n* the groups which could theoretically be saved are the ones that are alive in the first step, but dead after the player passes (because the opponent supposedly has a move that can kill the group after the pass)\n\nIf this happens to the same group many times in a row, just take the first one. We don't want to create a bunch of duplicate problems.\n\nsave all these positions into a separate folder for further processing. These aren't problems just yet, just situations of interest.\n\nFrom here, take each board position and simplify the board as much as possible:\n\n1. remove a random stone from the board\n2. check the variation (or maybe just the key points) which saves the group\n3. if the solution changes for the group we are interested in, put the stone back.\n4. shrink the board if possible (make sure steps 2-3 still pass after shrinkage)\n5. repeat steps 1-4 until all the stones left on the board are contributing to the life or death of the group (can't be removed). Save this board position into a new folder\n\nFinally, we can loop through all the simplified positions and hash them somehow (as well as all their rotations and reflections). Using the hashes, we can detect when two problems are duplicates. Throw away all duplicates.\n\nNow we are left with a bunch of go problems taken from real games! It may be possible to generate the solutions and the wrong variations for all these problems so we can put them on the OGS server to interact with, but that seems relatively easy if we can create the problems in the first place.\n\nI have no idea if this would work at all but I might try it someday", "created_utc": "1662090541.0", "edited": "1662091271.0", "id": "imr5f4m", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_x3ldng", "parent_id": "t3_x3ldng", "score": "4", "subreddit": "baduk", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhqe"}, {"author": "fishybird", "body": "sweet. we should make an open source version", "created_utc": "1662089195.0", "edited": "False", "id": "imr2sm9", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_x3b2wd", "parent_id": "t3_x3b2wd", "score": "1", "subreddit": "InternetIsBeautiful", "subreddit_id": "t5_2ul7u"}, {"author": "fishybird", "body": "Reading is proven to be the best way to aquire vocab and you don't even need to study/review.

(If you don't like the book in english, you sure as hell won't like it in a language where you have to work 10x as hard to understand it, so spend some time picking out the right book!)\n\nRead a paragraph in the spanish book, then the same paragraph in the english book, and then in the spanish book again. Only then can you use a dictionary to look up any words you want, but skip the words that you haven't seen before and don't recognize. Do this for each paragraph of the book. If a paragraph is too hard, just do one sentence at a time. I think when I started, I did once sentence at a time for the whole first and second chapter. But after that, I was able to do whole paragraphs and then eventually two paragraphs at a time.\n\nThe reason it is important to skip looking up words you don't recognize is because a large portion of the book, maybe 15%, is words that only show up 2 or 3 times in the whole book. They are usually words that no one even uses in regular conversations. Words like \"governance\", \"burlap\", \"velvet\", or \"toupee\". You probably don't need to know these words right now; just focus on whatever words make you think \"hey, I've seen that word a couple times in the last few paragraphs but I still can't tell what it means even after reading the english translation\"\n\nIt will be slow, but as long as you keep the dictionary closed as much as possible it's only about 3-4x as slow as reading normally. If you enjoy the book enough you'll actually stick with it. Maybe pick a book with enough action and suspense to make up for the slow pace. Get the audiobook if you can and read along.\n\nThe part of the process where you'll actually learn stuff is when you read the passage in spanish after knowing what it says in english; your brain will automatically fill in all the meanings of the words without you having to touch a dictionary. That's what makes learning words so fast!\n\nFor me, I did this with 'The Hunger Games' and 'Los Juegos Del Hambre'.

Start at the top of the list and keep scrolling down until you only understand \\~50% the words. That's about how many words you know.

Something like twitch streaming, youtube, or a blog. This does three things:\n\n* people who want to contribute can watch past videos to learn how the code works, reducing the learning curve and barrier of entry on contributions. Reading the code base is one thing, but hearing you talk about your vision and your reasoning for all the design decisions will help people understand what you're doing. \n* it has a side effect of being educational content for people wanting to learn how to do what you're doing. If the quality of the content is good, you are contributing more than just code to the community. It also spreads the word about the project\n* If you stop working on the project, there's a pool of people who can pick up right where you left off and understand every decision you made from the very beginning. No more \"I want to make a change but I'm afraid I might break something\" \n\nConsider that some of the most starred projects on github are things like \"Create X from scratch\". Think about all the people who never understood on a deeper level how to use a particular technology or algorithm until they implemented it themselves. If people who understand your code don't exist, you can create them.\n\nCheck out [https://www.youtube.com/c/TheChernoProject](https://www.youtube.com/c/TheChernoProject) for an example of exactly what I'm talking about. Every time he adds a feature to his game engine, all he has to do is record it and BOOM he has a tutorial he can publish as well (albeit with some editing magic). He also provides other services to the community like code review.\n\nI also think that seeing his passion for what he is doing is a huge factor in getting others excited about it as well.

The problem is that 'learning' a word takes so much time that there are not enough hours in the day to learn 50 of them.\n\nYou can do 50 anki cards easily, but\n\n1) each word has multiple definitions AND multiple forms. When linguists count the number of 'words' in a language, they are actually counting lemmas which means they count all forms of a word as one lemma (for example, \"be, was, am\" would all be one lemma). so to have a card for each definition would probably mean you need 30,000 cards, not 5,000. Think you can handle 300 new anki cards a day?\n\n2) there are lots of rules associated with the use of each word, and not just grammar rules. sometimes a word might be correct according to the definition you memorized but would sound WEIRD if you actually used it. For instance, you can \"go to bed\" but you can't \"go to chair\". You can \"go for a walk\" but you can't \"go for a shop\". You \"drive a car\" but don't  \"drive a bike\" unless it's a motorcycle. Memorizing definitions rarely captures the nuance of even simple words that we use in our every day lives.\n\nLearning each word means encountering it in a hundred different situations.

They were in the background rather than something I was 'serious' about. I'm not sure if it was worth the extra stress but at least I have less loans than I would have otherwise.\n\nIf you're really serious about education and you also want a social life, I would recommend just focusing on school and friends. Just those two alone will be quite the handful. I had absolutely no social life outside of my roommates and nearly no memory of my time during the last two semesters.\n\nIdk if you've worked really hard for extended periods of time before, but my memory of those moments don't seem continuous. More like scattered periods of time in which I was either on the grind or sitting under a tree trying to relax.\n\nAlso, being that busy will make you much more prone to picking up poor habits. I never had time to cook so I basically ate out all the time. Taco Bell every day for lunch on my way from work to class. A redbull every morning to wake me up for work. Skipping meals because of bad traffic. Always moving, never making friends or pursuing relationships. Time was so blurry. I would wake up from naps in a panic, unsure of the time and whether or not I had class or work next. Did I go to work already today? Is today a wednesday or a tuesday? Don't I have something due tonight? No, it's a Saturday.\n\nAnd just like classes began, they passed overhead like a bird I only caught a glimpse of out the corner of my eye. Semesters really do pass quickly. Work isn't that interesting, either. It pays well, but every day is the same. Much like the students at UTA, I find that my coworkers aren't much for conversation. Everyone mostly keeps to themselves. Head down, clock in, clock out. Eat in your car alone for lunch. Maybe there's something good on YouTube today. Try not to make eye contact with the people in the cars next to you; they are doing the same thing.\n\n...\n\nAnyway, tldr: if you wanna social life you gotta put effort into it. I would recommend focusing on friendships instead of work *or* school, if you can afford it. Delete social media if you can. If you can get out of the habit of checking your phone all the time, you'll realize how often everyone else is on theirs. It's like waking up from the matrix. You'll start feeling awkward when you can't just pull out your phone to avoid looking 'out of place'. also r/fuckcars.

Or in other words, young kids would never understand the jokes that adults would make because it required a level of language understanding that the kids just didn't have yet.\n\nHe explained that the languages that developed in small tribes like this had no real limit to how complex they could evolve to become. Because of the small population, new words, phrases, slang and grammar could spread easily and become 'standardized' much quicker than something like English or Mandarin. \n\nIn large languages you can't really use slang with a stranger and expect them to understand. Another factor is that many large languages become large because of colonization. If you force a bunch of foreigners to learn your language, they won't learn it perfectly and the language as a whole will tend towards simplification. That is why Latin has way more conjugations than the romance languages. Mandarin is another example, which almost has no grammar at all. English has simplified quite a bit too, since it used to have lots of conjugations and gender like the other PIE languages.\n\nSo in conclusion, the languages of small tribes become more complex over time and the languages of large colonizer societies become more simple over time.

I would personally recommend Dr. K the healthy gamer, who teaches meditation and mental health. He also has lots of good stuff on addiction, including porn addiction. I think he is primarily an addiction psychiatrist in his professional life so I have found many of his talks extremely useful.\n\nAny advice I would give on meditation would be to dispell some common myths about it. Lots of people think meditation is about quieting your mind. Stopping your thoughts. Except for people who are very very skilled at meditation, like people who have been doing it for weeks, months, years or even decades, this is impossible. I can only 'stop' my thoughts for 5 to 20 seconds before I get distracted by them again.\n\nSo, many people will try meditation, realize how difficult it is for them to stop their thoughts, and they will assume that they just can't meditate. They won't try again either. But really, the point of meditation is to allow your mind to wander, and then remind yourself that you are meditating. This might happen 5 or 500 times during a 20 minute session, and that's all ok. Remembering that you are meditating is like a muscle you are exercising. Each time you remember, you are doing a rep.\n\nJust like exercising your muscles at the gym, your body will get stronger and healthier and you will have benefits in your day to day life outside of the gym.\n\nMeditation is the same way. Practicing presence for 20 minutes a day will improve every aspect of your life because you are raising your base level of awareness. Your thoughts will transform from \"I am horny\" to \"I am having horny thoughts\". When hornyness is no longer who you are (I 'am' horny), and is just something you temporarily have (I 'have' these urges), it's much easier to let go of them.\n\nBut yeah feeling the positive effects of meditation does take time and effort.

Unless it's on a video game or a book lol. For me, when I meditate for 20 minutes, I am sure as hell not focused for the whole time. But that's the point. You gotta let your mind wander. The skill meditation builds is not to quiet the mind, it's to spontaneously become aware of your thoughts. Thoughts naturally quiet down when you become aware of them, and then 20 seconds later the mind will wander again.\n\nIn other words, mind wandering is an important step of the process. The practice is how often you remember that your meditating.\n\nThat's how I do it anyways!

Slightly more than four which makes groups harder to capture, but not as much as six which I believe would be too much (though I haven't tried).\n\nAnother interesting feature is that both ladders and ko are impossible, so in a way, it's less about tactics and more about 'surrounding' than regular go. The extra liberty makes it easier for groups to 'slip' away from your enemies talons, since groups have more directions to run. That helps your groups stay alive, and maybe you can focus on territory and position rather than on complex fighting and tactics.\n\nI haven't ever played a whole game through, just played against myself and these are the hypotheses I came up with. Would love to test it someday.\n\nEdit: Also, something I forgot to mention is that your groups cant form straight lines on a pentagonal board like they can on the grid.

I have a conspiracy theory that it is mostly useless and the only reason anyone uses it is because they rely on the dopamine hit they receive while watching the number of words they \"know\" slowly inch up over time to feel like it's worth it to continue. That was certainly the case for me.\n\nMost, if not all, language acquisition happens subconsciously so it's easy to convince ourselves nothing is happening, and we all want a way to measure our progress so that we don't feel like we are wasting our efforts. That's all Anki does: measure how many words you \"know\" so that you can feel a little better about yourself. Except, at least in my case, none of my Anki words were actually \"known\" and it was a massive waste of time.\n\nI understand that making your own Anki cards and including example sentences with each vocab word (two things I definitely did not do) is probably more effective, but that's still a massive amount of time to spend on just making the cards. I have found that reading in TL with a copy of the text in English for reference is way more time efficient and way less painful. (It's fun, actually)\n\nFor repeating media, I only do it for TV shows that I really love, typically things I have seen in English first. And, I only re-watch them every once and a while, just for fun. I do find it helpful actually. It helped my ear adjust to the sounds of the language early on, and hearing the voice actors have fun with their lines really increased my motivation for language learning and caused me to start taking it way more seriously. Because of those cartoons, I'm getting into other more difficult medias like books, which I wouldn't have dreamed of doing just two months ago. \n\nAt first my only motivation for learning my TL was that I thought it would be cool to be bilingual, the same way it would be cool to juggle or do magic tricks, but deep down I didn't actually enjoy how TL sounded.

Really, I've dabbled in many things. I fantasize about someday having all the knowledge required to create a whole system from scratch. Programming language, kernel, gui framework, and all. I'll certainly never have the time to actually build all that, but it'd be cool to know I can.\n\nWhat excites me about jai, and I assume this is the case for many fans, is actually less about the language itself and more about the philosophy of it. Jon Blow is pretty cynical about the current state of the industry and the quality of software we accept. And of course, this is something we all experience in our day to day lives. Software is constantly failing or is slowing down, but we are all ok with it because it's just so normal.\n\nBeing a game developer, he understands what modern computers are capable of so he doesn't really accept that the tools we have are the best we can have. It's like a breath of fresh air hearing someone acknowledge the lunacy we accept so blindingly as reality.\n\nSo if that guy makes a programming language, it just has to be good, right?\n\nOh yeah but to answer your question on C++, I once had a school assignment where I had to use the gtk library. Compile times were two minutes for about  5000 lines of code. Turns out my makefile wasn't that great, and it was compiling the whole thing from scratch each time. I spent about an hour on my makefile to fix comp times, and could only get it down to 30 seconds. Now, that was a lot better, but when doing GUI work, fast iterations are super important. You need to try something, see how it looks, and repeat many many times until the gui feels right. It was unbearable.\n\nAdditionally, I despised working with object oriented code. Every time I added a button or some shit to the gui, I had to implement that button in like 4 different files. It's gotta be in the glade file, the h file, the constructor, and then you gotta bind the button press event to a function. (Most my bugs were caused by misspelling the name of the button in one of those four places. So, as you can imagine, most of my bug fixing wasn't doing anything particularly interesting, it was double checking all the files to make sure spelling was right) Refactoring was a nightmare. OO code has always seemed to be \"write once\" to me.\n\n(Compare this to languages built around gui coding, like html. All those things can be accomplished in one line <button onclick=alert(\"click\")>Click me!<\\\\button> or something like that. It'd be nice to have a low level language that concise with gui stuff)\n\nSo I guess what initially sold me on jai is how fast compilation was and the absence of h files...

It will only get better with time.\n\nAs far as scripts go, only actors can make a script feel truly \"natural\". By script I mean writing out every word and reading from it exactly as it's written. Reading straight from a script almost always sounds terrible, even for native speakers. \n\nInstead you should try an outline. If you don't know what an outline is, instead of writing down what you're going to say word for word, you write down what you're going to talk about as bullet points. For instance, an outline for explaining the different parts of a computer might be:\n\nParts of a computer\n    - CPU\n        - stands for central processing unit\n        - executes the machine code of your programs\n            - machine code is represented as 1's and 0's\n    - Memory (RAM)\n        - a place for the CPU to quickly write lots of 1's and 0's\n        - the data here is used to store information about programs running\n        - the CPU doesn't hold that much info so it needs memory to run bigger programs\n        - memory is only temporary and will go away once the computer is powered off\n    - Storage\n        - memory but permanent/persistent\n\n... And so on and so on\n\nThe outline can be as detailed as you want it to be (the one above can be either a 1 minute speech or a 10 minute speech), but you should not be reading it word for word. Think of it as a gentle guide so you don't forget what the main points should be and you don't forget to talk about something important.\n\nTake a look at TED talks on youtube. Most the time, the speakers done memorize a whole speech word for word. Almost no one can do that and practically no one does. Instead, they all memorize an outline of the speech and each time they give the speech it's a little different.\n\nOutlines are much more flexible and you can record many different takes of the same outline and pick which one you like the best. \n\nYou're at the point with your English where regular English is no longer a problem for you, it's the art of writing and giving speeches which even native speakers have to practice to master.\n\nThere are lots of good videos on YouTube about how to write/speak for an audience.

Psychs, along with other methods for achieving higher states of consciousness like meditation, running, love, and so on, can ultimately hold you back if you become so reliant on them that they are the ONLY way you can be here now. Ultimately, you don't want to need psychs to have a good time. You don't want to meditate hours every day. You just want to be.\n\nSo the argument I've heard thrown around a lot is psychs are extremely useful for making you aware of alternate states of being, which might be the only way you would have found out in the first place, but it shouldn't be seen as a spiritual cure all. Buddhists believe that spending time on a spiritual practice is the only way to 100% ensure long term spiritual progression. When you take a drug, you may be high for a while but you eventually come back down. Reaching those states without drugs is possible but takes practice.\n\nTldr: psychs are fine but they're only temporary. Making progress spiritually takes a lot more work and time. Taking psychs is like taking the helicopter to the top of a mountain to see the view, but you've got to land eventually. Spiritual practice is like climbing the mountain and then living up there\n\nEdit: to be clear I am in no way qualified to speak on behalf of buddhists, because I am not one. \n\nPersonally I suspect that psychs might help progress someone's spirituality, particularly with the healing of past traumas which is the vital first step of any spiritual path. I have no idea about after that though. Maybe after that point they really can't play a bigger role\n\nEdit 2: also worth noting that the average psychedelic user and the average buddhist just have different goals, so they obviously have different opinions on the value of psychs on achieving those goals. The average person taking a psychedelic might just be having fun or trying to heal trauma. No buddhist would say they're against fun or healing.

I was flabbergasted.\n\nThen they put signs up everywhere and they flood your email trying to get you to renew your lease. They'll say shit like \"renew now for a $100 gift card!\" Or \"renew now and get $3 off per month!\" Like yeah right is that supposed to convince anyone? Clean the damn stairwells and fix the broken doors, air conditioning, ovens ect. and then maybe we can talk.\n\nAnd you gotta be careful if you move there because they will do sneaky things to cheat you out of your money... If you pay your rent with card it's a $20 fine. They were charging me near $70 for the move out process, but after I asked WHY I owed that much they said (after three weeks of trying to contact them, mind you) \"oops sorry\" and lowered it to $20. Then, on top of all that, they send you emails which say \"you still have unsigned documents pending\" so of course you click on them because it sounds important, but it's just another damn lease they want you to sign up for. My old roommate was tricked into another 6 months there because of this. He didn't read what he was signing up for, it just seemed like a required document.\n\nCampus Edge is evil and sleazy.

There are other active cacti but those are the most common. You could also grow some peyote but peyote is illegal and grows so slowly that those who do cultivate it do it for the preservation of the species rather than for it's mescaline. \n\nYou may be able to find trichocereus cuttings online, like through Reddit (r/magicplantsexchange) or through ebay. There are also various other online vendors but I am not familiar with any. \n\nIf you want a challenge, you could grow from seed and then graft the seedlings onto a leafy fast growing cacti called pereskiopsis which speeds up the growth of the seedlings drastically, and then you'd have all the cacti you'll ever need.\n\nI'd personally recommend starting from seed because it's way cheaper. You'd get hundreds of cacti for the price of a few cuttings and some time. Thankfully trichocereus grow fairly fast compared to other cacti, and that speed is even greater if you graft.\n\nThere are a few downsides to grafting, however. The pereskiopsis pumps so much water into the seedling that it can look somewhat bloated, potentially changing or ruining the natural beauty of the cactus. Also, if it's mescaline you care about, the pereskiopsis will not speed up the production of mescaline, it will just give you a bigger less potent cactus. For these reasons, it's common to eventually de-graft the trichocereus, plant it, and let it grow on its own roots for a year or so. \n\nIt may seem counter productive, but I believe this is still the fastest way to mescaline, if that's what you are looking for.\n\nEither way, if you plan on keeping the cacti outside, make sure they don't get too cold! I'm not sure what the weather in Denver is like, but if it's too cold in the winter for cacti then keep all of your cacti in pots so you can bring them inside, or find another way to keep them warm.\n\nEdit: Oh also there's no rule saying you have to graft to pereskiopsis. It's just the most popular grafting stock because it makes the seedling grow insanely fast. There are other cacti you can use as grafting stock which will still speed up the growth but not as much, so you may be able to avoid some of the issues with pereskiopsis.", "created_utc": "1576659043.0", "edited": "1576659343.0", "id": "fba15hm", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_ec99ca", "parent_id": "t3_ec99ca", "score": "3", "subreddit": "druggardening", "subreddit_id": "t5_2uggx"}, {"author": "fishybird", "body": "The Earth's surface is rotating at 1000 miles per hour, which may seem fast compared to the moon, but the moon actually rotates around earth at 2288 miles per hour!\n\nAlso it has a lot to do with conservation of angular momentum, which is\n\nAngular Momentum = mass \u00d7 velocity \u00d7 radius\n\nVelocity can be like the speed of the spacecraft, mass is it's mass, and radius is it's distance from the center of Earth's mass. \n\nThe amount of angular momentum you have always has to stay constant, and if you are in a spaceship, then your mass is staying constant too as you move in towards earth.\n\nSo, in the above equation, if angular momentum and mass are not changing, and your radius is getting smaller (getting closer to Earth), then velocity MUST go up to keep angular momentum from changing.

You can grow, buy, and sell San Pedro cactus legally. It's an ornamental cactus, you can buy it online or at some nurseries if you're lucky. If you're unfamiliar with mescaline, it's what \"the doors of perception\" was written about.\n\nIt's just as powerful as the other psychs and it's the favorite pych for many people. It's not as popular as the other pychs because it's a lot more work to prepare.\n\nIt grows a foot a year, and a dose is roughly one foot. If a microdose is 1/10th of a dose, you'll need to grow one foot for each month you microdose. So if you want to microdose every month of the year, you'd need at least 12 cacti. Buying that many cacti would be pretty expensive. You could start from seed and have hundreds of cacti but you'd also have to wait several years before they are big enough to take.\n\nTo speed up growth from seed you could graft to pereskiopsis.", "created_utc": "1572012061.0", "edited": "False", "id": "f55qjqv", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_dmndt4", "parent_id": "t3_dmndt4", "score": "2", "subreddit": "microdosing", "subreddit_id": "t5_2yt3g"}, {"author": "fishybird", "body": "San Pedro and it's other psychedelic relatives generally grow a foot a year, which is faster than most cacti. So 6-7 cacti will get you 6-7 feet per year, if the conditions are right. You just have to wait until they are old enough to be growing that fast. But if that's still not fast enough, you can graft seedlings to pereskiopsis and it accelerates that growth like crazy. Pereskiopsis are insanely cool. They are some of the only cactus with leaves and their water loving roots are actually more like the roots you'd see on a tropical plant rather than a typical cactus. They grow a stunning one inch per week! I'm not sure how much exactly it speeds up the growth on San Pedros, so if someone could get me that info I'd love to hear it. Regardless of what you do, It wouldn't be hard to be self sufficient on mescaline.\n\nAnd like someone else mentioned, you could also be self sufficient on DMT. Many plants contain it.\n\nAnother plant you may be interested in is Morning Glory and Hawaiian Baby Wood Rose (not sure I spelled it right, it's typically just referred to as it's acronym HBWR). The seeds are psychedelic and they have similar effect to LSD if you can get passed the nausea (Some people don't feel it at all, and for others, it's the worst pain they've ever felt). It's completely legal (to grow and own, but not to eat) and you can get the morning Glory seeds from Home Depot. Just don't eat the seeds you get from the store because they are supposedly coated with toxins to deter you from eating them. I am suspicious that those who had terrible experiences from the seeds simply ate the ones they got from the store. Somebody correct me if your experience says otherwise. Also, you can prepare or extract the magic from the seeds to either lessen or completely get rid of the negative side effects.\n\nSo with a little botanical knowledge, you can supply your own mushrooms, mescaline, DMT, and LSDish.
