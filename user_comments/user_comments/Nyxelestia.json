The exact degree didn't matter like it does today, in the world of copyright law.\n\nNow, what constitutes original fiction is largely a lot of gatekeeping by institutions (i.e. publishing houses or production companies, copyright law, intellectual property, etc.) And who has historically run these institutions?

And because there's no gatekeeping, there wasn't this domination of the niche by people in economic power as there was for original fiction. It was, in essence, the perfect place for women who wanted to tell stories that would not be popular with cishet male audiences, nor *enough* cishet female audiences to overcome that gender disparity.\n\nA lot of that gatekeeping still exists at a very cultural level - look at the backlash every female-lead addition to the MCU gets in comparison to all the male-lead stories that no one bats an eye at, or ask female sci-fi and fantsy fans about the amount of misogyny we're expected to tolerate just to participate, which male fans never even have to think about if they don't want to.

I took a class in college for one semester, but that was a time I sucked at school in general and this class was just no exception.\n\nA few years ago, I started to get really into danmei - Chinese media focused on \"male friendship\" (frequently with gay subtext, or based off of less-censored books with explicit gay text). There were more and more book translations and resources built around these books and shows, so diving in seemed like a great idea.\n\nBut I've been really soured on the Chinese media industry over the last year and the last few months especially. Starting from things like the government blaming celebrities for their *fan's* behavior (i.e. [like actor Xiao Zhan being blamed for his fans writing sexually explicit stories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boycott_against_Xiao_Zhan_Incident#Background)), to political smear campaigns [like 813](https://medium.com/@1000snow/the-crucifixion-of-zhang-zhehan-in-the-age-of-misinformation-5b08b0d06e40), which took the Chinese equivalent of a couple edited Wikipedia entries and a few innocuous vacation photos to annihilate a rising star's career), to the vitriolic internal fandom wars ([that are very cult-like](https://medium.com/@1000snow/i-was-part-of-a-conspiracy-cult-on-twitter-c12d768981a4)), and which are apparently the norm for Chinese entertainment.\n\nChina's \"entertainment industry\" is really more of an endorsement industry made up of entertainment. The cultural and industry fixation on \"idols\"/celebrities, rather than the art and music they actually make, has left me really disinterested in engaging with Chinese media any further. It's full of celebrity back-stabbing, since a lot of the above scandals I linked to were most likely started by co-stars who financially benefited from their co-stars' careers' fall. Being a fan engaged in Chinese media basically requires being a part-time private investigator, showing appreciation predominantly through spending money, and hanging up your (fandom) identity on strangers. None of this is what I get into a movie or a show for.\n\nThe CCP used all of this to justify a crack-down on the industry which will likely do nothing to stop any of these actual problems but will go a long way to tighten censorship, which had been loosening for over a decade until last year. So a lot of the stories I was getting interested in, is less likely going forward.\n\nThe fandom for the show I was really invested in descended into lots of cult-like division and behavior (the third hyperlink above). I've lost many of the friends I've made through it, because they insist on clinging to their conspiracy theories instead of admitting that an actor they liked might not live up to their fantasy of him. The friends I've kept, we're less and less focused on Chinese media and branching out to media from other countries, i.e. similar genres from Thailand. (Or already have been; I never got into K-Pop but a lot of my friends from Chinese fandom were super into it).\n\n**tl;dr - My professional life is unlikely to involve enough interaction with China to make knowing Chinese worthwhile, and my primary personal reason for learning Chinese has also imploded over the last few months, and after over a year of decline.**\n\nThai is drawing my attention, now. Some of what drew me to Chinese linguistically is also in Thai, the country's entertainment industry seems much less toxic, and it's linguistically closer to Bengali (which I'm avoiding right now for emotional reasons, but do intend to learn one day).", "created_utc": "1658809990.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ihobwz1", "is_submitter": "True", "link_id": "t3_w821wt", "parent_id": "t1_ihnhmtp", "score": "8", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "Nyxelestia", "body": "What are you doing different this time around compared to your previous false starts?", "created_utc": "1658806981.0", "edited": "False", "id": "iho6hob", "is_submitter": "True", "link_id": "t3_w821wt", "parent_id": "t1_ihnqnj4", "score": "1", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "Nyxelestia", "body": "My Immortal was a satire.", "created_utc": "1658794778.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ihnfy7c", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_w7v8gi", "parent_id": "t1_ihly2f9", "score": "0", "subreddit": "CuratedTumblr", "subreddit_id": "t5_3x5kfw"}, {"author": "Nyxelestia", "body": "Doesn't one of the Anne Rice novels basically open this way as well?", "created_utc": "1658794718.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ihnftbo", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_w7v8gi", "parent_id": "t3_w7v8gi", "score": "1", "subreddit": "CuratedTumblr", "subreddit_id": "t5_3x5kfw"}, {"author": "Nyxelestia", "body": "Thank you.", "created_utc": "1658794103.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ihneg6s", "is_submitter": "True", "link_id": "t3_w821wt", "parent_id": "t1_ihn3n84", "score": "1", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "Nyxelestia", "body": "It does, thank you!\n\nAnd funny enough, the target language I'm thinking of dropping is Chinese.

I'm Indian, and while I was born and raised in the U.S. to somewhat non-religious parents, I do still come from a culturally Hindu background.\n\nIndia has a tradition of polygyny - and historically, had at various times had traditions of true polygamy, in that women could have multiple husbands (though almost always all brothers/sons of the same patrilineal family), while men could marry multiple women (and sisters if they wanted, though that was rare).\n\nWhile there is abuse, there is also plenty of abuse in monogamous societies. Meanwhile, women often viewed polygyny as *beneficial for them*. It was a type of protection (there would be other women who had your back against a husband if he turned out to be abusive), and supportive (share the load of marriage and childrearing), etc.\n\nNot to say there haven't also been situations where wives were pitted against each other or in competition with each other, just that it wasn't inherently so. Even if a husband wasn't abusive and was perfectly fine, it was still seen as an opportunity for a type of sisterhood. With varying degrees of veracity and anecdata, women might see this as \"sharing a man with\" the other women, or even actively seek men who already had wives for its benefits.\n\nAll of that is with the massive caveat that I'm talking about a society spanning dozens of cultures, hundreds of languages and traditions, and thousands of years.\n\nBut no, polygamy is not inherently bad or abusive. Cults are abusive, underage marriages are abusive, and social isolation are abusive (not to mention, of course, actual abuse itself).

But the tl;dr is that it's extremely unlikely to be constitutional, but with SCOTUS being what it is, that might not matter.\n\n**Armchair Legalese:**\n\nFor the most part, no, states cannot prohibit travel between states or mandate another state send someone back. There is one exception that anti-choice states are hoping to take advantage of.\n\nBoth of that protection and that exception are in [Section 2 of Article 4 of the Constitution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_Four_of_the_United_States_Constitution#Section_2:_Rights_of_state_citizens;_rights_of_extradition).\n\nClause 1 says that when a person travels to another state, they are given the privileges and immunities of the state they traveled to. In effect, you are treated legally as if you were a resident.\n\nClause 2 is the exception, which is that if someone is charged with a crime in their home state and trying to flee justice from their home state, the state they travel to is obligated to send this person back.\n\nThe catch is that the person *has to be charged with a crime* - and they have to have already committed the thing that's illegal in their home state, and they have to have done it *in* their own state. So if someone is traveling to another state to terminate a pregnancy, then by default they have not committed an abortion in their own state, and therefore committed no crime.\n\nThe catch to that catch, though, is that conspiring to commit a crime can also be a charge - i.e. even if you are stopped before you kill someone, you can still be charged with conspiring to murder. So states might try to charge a woman with *conspiring to terminate a pregnancy*.\n\nHowever, based on precedent, you would have to conspire to commit that crime *in the place that it is illegal* in order to be charged with that crime. It's the reason why you can plan a vacation to Las Vegas to enjoy the casinos without being charged for \"conspiring to gamble\" in your own state where it's illegal. It's why business owners can plan to do business in other states that might have different regulations from their own. It's why women are currently, legally able to travel to other states for an abortion, even if it's illegal in their own.\n\nSo far, based on precedent and the constitution, you cannot legally stop someone from going to another state for an abortion for the same reasons you cannot stop your residents from planning a vacation to Las Vegas to go to casinos that are illegal in your own state. You cannot stop a person from taking advantage of another state's different laws for the same reasons businesses cannot be stopped from conducting parts of their business in other states whose industry regulations might be different from your own.\n\nIt's possible that this could be overturned, as SCOTUS has been doing a *lot* lately. But if they did, they would effectively tank interstate commerce with it. That would be a massive economic blow to the country, and devastate businesses small and large, which in turn would have ripple effects on the global economy.\n\nThe fear is that right now, **there are a lot of people in power who are absolutely misogynistic enough to be willing to burn down the American economy in order to control women's bodies**.", "created_utc": "1656789381.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ielzr4z", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_vpqeg3", "parent_id": "t1_iekiv9i", "score": "1", "subreddit": "WhitePeopleTwitter", "subreddit_id": "t5_35n7t"}, {"author": "Nyxelestia", "body": "Given how many people are now looking into sterilization due to lack of abortion access, this might actually backfire.", "created_utc": "1656786963.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ielue38", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_vppsy5", "parent_id": "t1_iel0rb5", "score": "7", "subreddit": "WhitePeopleTwitter", "subreddit_id": "t5_35n7t"}, {"author": "Nyxelestia", "body": "> Can't the doctors just lie?\n\nSome probably do, but we certainly wouldn't hear about it if they did - which is a good thing, as it leaves them in a position to continue protecting women.\n\nBut yes, as others have pointed out, anti-choice doctors can also lie, and fellow staff (many of whom will also be anti-choice) may rat out pro-choice doctors trying to protect their patients.", "created_utc": "1656786870.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ielu6h1", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_vppsy5", "parent_id": "t1_iel0mch", "score": "1", "subreddit": "WhitePeopleTwitter", "subreddit_id": "t5_35n7t"}, {"author": "Nyxelestia", "body": "A lot of Indians make an effort to make them look different now when we do use them (typically putting them at an angle and putting in dots).

Some of the older antisemitic imagery in Western media are Indian/South Asian archetypes repurposed.\n\nSo like, merchantilism has historically been a source of suspicion in Europe, and haggling became viewed as a mechanism for duplicity and exploitation - so the Happy Merchant stereotype is both a shorthand implication that the character is Jewish or supposed to be Jewish, but also comes with the connotation that this merchant is suspicious or duplicitous, and is \"haggling\" in order to cheat you. In contrast, respect for merchantilism goes *much* farther back in India, and haggling is viewed more positively, so the Happy Merchant archetype exists there without the immediate implication that the figure is supposed to be Jewish, and with connotations closer to the American Industrialist Businessman^(TM) (\"he\" - and it's usually a he - \"worked hard and is well educated and successful\"), and haggling is viewed as two individuals pushing for economic equilibrium between themselves (as opposed to the *system* generating equilibrium as modern capitalism does).\n\nOr, big noses! British colonialism influenced South Asian beauty standards towards Euro-centric features quite a bit. My mother used to lament to my face that she wished she could afford to pay for me to get a nose job, and has been since I was a child. She basically thought that should be my big young adult expense after college. Now, as de-colonial sentiment gains steam in Indian/South Asian media, so too does push back against those white-centric beauty standards. Among other things, that means Indian body positivity can include taking pride in a large nose - whereas in the West, a large nose is an antisemitic caricature.\n\nThe imagery of a middle-aged or older woman with large glasses, hair in a tight bun, stern face, etc.? Meant to shit on older Jewish women, but I grew up with that same imagery indicating a woman was probably a teacher or school marm of some kind (and thus someone respected in her community).\n\nAnd of course, most infamously, the swastika. My mother's household even here in the U.S. was somewhat insulated wrt American culture, so I didn't really learn about WWII or the Holocaust until 5th grade...a few weeks ahead of my classmates, when my teacher told me to never, ever doodle a swastika on my assignment again, because in the western world it is *not* a good luck symbol like it is in India and like it was in my home.\n\n**tl;dr - a lot of anti-semitic media imagery and caricatures are actually Indian archetypes repurposed out of their positive connotations in South Asian media and into negative connotations in Western media.**", "created_utc": "1656739048.0", "edited": "False", "id": "iejlyj4", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_vp30wy", "parent_id": "t1_iegz5zd", "score": "3", "subreddit": "CuratedTumblr", "subreddit_id": "t5_3x5kfw"}, {"author": "Nyxelestia", "body": "Congratulations!\n\nAnd I just want to say that if you are able to read and write coherently enough to write out this post title/caption, you *do* have an education.

Among American students, they were far, far fewer in number (and it was having one too many of these that made me decide to stop and go straight again).", "created_utc": "1655428244.0", "edited": "False", "id": "icniwwd", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_vdsp3v", "parent_id": "t1_icmg3sa", "score": "29", "subreddit": "AskAnAmerican", "subreddit_id": "t5_2uah7"}, {"author": "Nyxelestia", "body": "idk how many other countries have this issue but for the love of all that is holy and unholy *don't chew with your mouth open*\n\nMy parents were born and raised in India and I have to remind my mother to chew with her mouth closed all the damn time.

Yes, the fans' attention is a big part of what dictated the pay - and the fans' racism is *why* they paid more attention to white characters and male characters, and less attention to non-white characters and female characters. Fans and creators are coming from the same population, they have the same subconscious biases.\n\nRacism isn't about the individuals - it's about the groups they are in and the systems and communities they are participating in. It also frequently is not about the choices you personally make. When you say you stayed on Teen Wolf for Stiles and Lydia, I believe you. I also know them to both be white. This does *not* mean you are racist, nor that I think you are. This could just be a coincidence - but it's a might big coincidence that *so many* people \"just like\" the white characters more, no matter how well or poorly written they are or how well or poorly acted they are.\n\nThis is not about you, as an individual fan.

The rest of the characters who got less and less screentime or narrative are overwhelmingly the characters of color (Scott, Boyd, Danny, Mason) and female characters (Allison, Lydia, Malia), or both (Kira - whose actor Arden Cho [turned down a return to Teen Wolf due to getting offered less than half as much pay as her white colleagues](https://www.thecut.com/2022/05/arden-cho-talks-turning-down-teen-wolf-and-her-new-show.html)).\n\nThere has been a lot of progress in Hollywood over the last decade or two, and Teen Wolf *was* exceptionally diverse - but racism and sexism all still exist, and all still have an outsized impact on how characters and actors are chosen for and treated in the media industry.\n\nJohn Boyega has spoken extensively on this phenomena when it happened on a much larger scale in the latest Star Wars trilogy. The Star Wars fandom's infamous racism was just a much larger and more concentrated version of what happened in the Teen Wolf fandom.\n\nThis happened in Star Wars, in Teen Wolf, and in many other fandoms - I can't find it now but a while back I made a post about double standards in Teen Wolf fandom, but I forgot to put the fandom it was about in the text of the post itself. As it got reblogged further and further away from my corner of Tumblr, it kept getting tagged with more and more fandoms where that phenomena happened, Star Wars being the most common one but nowhere near the only one.\n\nThere is a lot of variance in writing quality across the show and across the characters - but there is also a lot of variance in [reception of low-quality writing](https://diversehighfantasy.tumblr.com/post/173162581601/airagorncharda-fans-need-to-stop-using-the) in the fandom based on the characters - underwritten characters of color and female characters are dismissed by fans due to lack of development, while underwritten white male characters are latched by fans onto as blank slates for further development. And that's before the malicious double standards, i.e. the fans who thought Stiles doing detective work and investigating in police matters was cute...then turn around and insist [Scott should be stoned at dawn](https://nyxelestia.tumblr.com/post/189131464142/poseyslegtattoo-poebrey-poseyslegtattoo) for helping that dog brought to the veterinary office he worked in. So even when Scott and Stiles *were* written similarly, they were treated very, very differently for it.\n\nDOB was a great actor, don't get me wrong - but so were Posey, Holland, and Reed, yet they faced *way* more dismissal, harassment, and hate from the fandom than he ever did. This trend built up over the years, which led to the writers giving Stiles more attention, and thus the fandom ignoring Scott and other characters more, which created a feedback loop that led to, as you put it, Stiles feeling like the main character.\n\nEdit: lmao literally the first thing I saw once I went back to my homepage after posting this comment: https://i.imgur.com/mIkMDSc.png", "created_utc": "1654117748.0", "edited": "False", "id": "iau1jo8", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_v2nt7j", "parent_id": "t3_v2nt7j", "score": "4", "subreddit": "TeenWolf", "subreddit_id": "t5_2sjll"}, {"author": "Nyxelestia", "body": "A bit of both.

The first Iron Man movie removed Tony Stark making a snide remark about people killing themselves for his level of opportunity, because the DoD didn't want *any* reference to suicide at a time when veteran suicides were making headlines. On the flipside, the first Avengers movie ultimately rejected the DoD aid when they disliked the implication an American pilot might take orders from an international body, or the imagery of an American nuking New York City.\n\n*On the other hand*, Disney and even just MCU aren't monoliths. Lots of individual creators are trying to get some kind of message or criticism out even through the perils of censorship. Art and fiction have long been challenges to authority, and Defense Department production support is just another obstacle.\n\nSo you get films like Captain America 2, where on the one hand the bad guys in the end are ultimately HYDRA/super-Nazis who infiltrated the American government, not the actual government itself...but, the plot they were fighting against was basically a sci-fi Patriot Act. So arguably, the movie is also saying \"this thing that the actual U.S. government sorta did irl 10-15 years ago is super shitty and only something a Nazi would want\". Captain America 3 shows both Tony and Steve making very valid points regarding superhero accountability and collateral damage vs institutionalization; they are both upset but both have valid reasons, and towards the end are willing to work together to find a good diplomatic solution - which is why they shoehorned in that (sub)plot with Baron Zemo wanting to destroy the Avengers, to generate the cinematic conflict when the original conflict was both nuanced and actually being handled in a nuanced manner. The Falcon and the Winter Soldier glorify Captain America and the military, but it also made the military's racism and shitty treatment of veterans central to the story, and criticized government inaction in the face of tragedy.\n\n**tl;dr MCU as a whole and Disney as a company gets a lot of production support from the DoD and thus lets the military influence the movies. But, individual creators often still find their own ways to slip in criticism or deconstruction while still getting through this implicit censorship, and some movies have rejected the military support (and thus censorship) entirely.**", "created_utc": "1653853869.0", "edited": "False", "id": "iagoerb", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_v0ad7u", "parent_id": "t1_iafvt8d", "score": "5", "subreddit": "WhitePeopleTwitter", "subreddit_id": "t5_35n7t"}, {"author": "Nyxelestia", "body": "Part of why I like Behind the Bastards is because I have low attention span and often listen to it while I'm doing something else.

The federal Department of Education's main job is to manage funding for schools, collect data about students and learning, and often study and analyze education itself. The Department of Education does not mandate curricula, nor can it make universities change how they do or don't administer exams or practice their applications process.\n\nThey can advise and guide, and set some parameters. So the Common Core is not mandatory - it is up to the states to choose whether they adopt that curriculum standard or not. *If* they do, then it will come with much more resources and support, but they can choose not to, and many states do exactly that. Similarly, they can set a few limitations - i.e. schools that receive federal funding cannot discriminate based on race, sex, etc. - but apart from some limits, they cannot otherwise tell schools what to do.\n\nEven the individual states often have limited power over the various districts within their state boundaries. So the state of Texas might reject the Common Core, but some individual districts might still follow along or copy it anyway.\n\nNone of this is to say the department is power*less* - it is tremendously influential, and the funding issue is no joke. Just that it is not as power*ful* as most other nations, or rather it is not a centralized authority like most other nations. So even though the President appoints who leads the department, in practice this doesn't give them that much power over the education system.\n\nThis extends to *all* the departments and administrative offices of the executive branch. **The president can have a big say in who leads these various departments - and thus, in turn, can help shape the overall direction/the priorities of the departments - but then has very little power beyond that.

If I were to publish a screenplay or a script, none of those would be up to me anyway, but obviously they are in a novel. I also have some mild aphantasia (inability to visually inside my head), so often even what description I do come up with is focused on sound (i.e. what a character's shoes sound like on the floor vs whatever they actually look like).\n\nThis style has given me some advantages, though: the most consistent and common praise I get on my writing is my characters' voices and personalities. When I'm not relying on it as an expository tool, my dialogue is usually pretty strong, and I'm good at making various characters distinct from one another purely through dialogue. I write 3rd person limited POVs, so I've gotten handy at using the descriptions themselves to convey a lot about a character (i.e. who looks around a room and notices the interior decoration vs who looks around a room and notices sightlines and exits, or a character who might describe something as \"blue\" vs the character who would differentiate between shades of blue, etc.)\n\nIronically, my \"screenplay\" leaning was the result of me going a little too far in my efforts to get away from *another* bad habit. Back when I was a teenager, I was quite guilty of my writing living in my characters' heads - focusing on introspection and characters *thinking* things. I realized this so I kinda thought \"okay, well we still learn all this stuff about characters in TV shows and movies, so I'll go learn how to do that!\" And it worked out well - just a little too well, as evidenced by all the aforementioned description problems I now have.

[This comparison](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsIQa7sH5_Y) between two Star Wars movies might be especially helpful in how to use action to build up character.
