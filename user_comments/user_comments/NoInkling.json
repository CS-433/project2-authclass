Also testing cookies using its cookie jar implementation is painful.\n\nIt *is* possible to test by calling the app directly, but that's done by using request/response mocks (for example, using [node-mocks-http](https://github.com/howardabrams/node-mocks-http)), and probably doesn't save that much overhead (over testing locally with real requests).

Some examples:\n\n- Playstation Studios stuff (God of War, Horizon, Ghost of Tsushima, Last of Us, Uncharted, Spiderman, etc.)\n- Assassin's Creed series\n- Destiny games\n- Borderlands series\n- Darksiders series (Genesis is an ARPG)\n- XCOM series (also Gears Tactics)\n- Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor/War\n- Bioshock series\n- Guardians of the Galaxy\n- Sekiro\n- Death Stranding\n- The newer Deus Ex games\n- Ghostwire Tokyo\n- Jedi Fallen Order\n- Beyond Good and Evil\n- Breath of the Wild (minimal voice acting)\n- Child of Light (minimal voice acting?)\n\nAlso I'm going to recommend Grim Fandango just because I can. There are a number of other point-and-click games with Spanish dubs, it's a good genre for this purpose.\n\nFew links that might be useful:\n\n- [PC games (all genres) with Spanish audio](https://www.pcgamingwiki.com/w/index.php?title=Special:Drilldown/L10n&limit=500&offset=0&Language%5B0%5D=Latin+American+Spanish&Language%5B1%5D=Spanish&Interface%5B0%5D=hackable&Interface%5B1%5D=true&Audio%5B0%5D=hackable&Audio%5B1%5D=true) (notice there are multiple pages)\n- [Games that have a Latin American dub](https://doblaje.fandom.com/es/wiki/Categor%C3%ADa:Videojuegos) (again, multiple pages)\n- [Database of Spain Spanish game dubs](https://www.doblajevideojuegos.es/)", "created_utc": "1660394689.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ik4enl4", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_wmv0jc", "parent_id": "t3_wmv0jc", "score": "1", "subreddit": "rpg_gamers", "subreddit_id": "t5_2su0w"}, {"author": "NoInkling", "body": "> Not sure if resemblance include that meaning in English or it's only related to appearance.\n\nIt can refer to other aspects in English too.", "created_utc": "1660371160.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ik3jhx9", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_wmz3gb", "parent_id": "t1_ik3ff6o", "score": "3", "subreddit": "Spanish", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qtt1"}, {"author": "NoInkling", "body": "> I think the beauty of the node ecosystem is using the power of the language itself and small libraries to create flexible, robust systems\n\nThe downside of this is the overhead of dealing with many disparate packages.

If I *modify* package.json so that a dependency's version range is incompatible with what's currently in package-lock.json, then a plain `npm install` will actually give package.json precedence and indeed change the \"locked\" version of the dependency in package-lock.json, [as described here](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/17979#issuecomment-332701215). I mean it makes some sense when you consider that there needs to be a way to \"sync up\" the lockfile when package.json is manually edited, that package.json was the authoritative source before lockfiles were introduced, and that `npm install` already generates a lockfile when one doesn't exist. But now I wish we didn't end up with a compromise where it respects the lockfile in some situations but not others, that's unnecessarily confusing.

While there are times when this makes sense, like in external authentication flows where you have to visit a webpage that you don't control, it shouldn't be necessary when you control both the client and the server. If your mobile client can remain in control by simply making an Ajax-style request, then that's generally preferable.\n\nIf however your server *does* need to control the flow at some point (i.e. you need to make a full webview/browser page request), then there are other options to return data to the client.\n\n- You can issue a redirect, but use the URL hash fragment to return the token instead. Unlike a query string, it doesn't get sent back to the server (at least not by any sane web browser/client) and therefore won't appear in server request logs. And it's easy to remove it from the URL on the client from JS by doing `location.hash = ''` (which is advised as a precaution, where it makes sense). Basically using the hash is strictly better than a query string in this situation. Actually this is the mechanism that authentication providers use when doing the so-called \"implicit\" flow.\n\nThe following options can just use the direct response, they don't require a redirect (and therefore won't show up in server request logs either). It's more ideal from a user experience perspective at least (one request instead of two), but that's a relatively minor point.\n\n- Return the token in a custom HTTP response header. The problem with this is that it only works if your mobile framework has some way to read it, because normal browser-based JS can't.\n\n- Return the token in a cookie. This can be read from JS, but it would need to be non-HttpOnly, and you would want to delete it after retrieving it. But seriously, if you're at the point of considering this, it's better to just use a cookie normally if that's workable.\n\n- Return the token embedded in the HTML.

It's possibly less of a problem with Maori as you've probably been hearing at least bits and pieces your whole life. Not speaking at all can make things less fun (or practical, if you're living in a country where it's necessary) though, so if you do want to try and speak at an early stage, the best thing you can do to work on your pronunciation is to mimic native audio as exactly as you can, accent and all. Duolingo isn't very good for this as it mostly uses TTS, however there's an audio course called Pimsleur that does it well - it's known for being expensive, but sometimes libraries carry it (either digitally or physically), and these days they have an app with a much cheaper subscription plan.\n\nIf you're serious about learning a language to fluency and want a roadmap with a methodology that has a strong theoretical basis (the so-called [input hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Input_hypothesis)), check out [refold.la](https://refold.la/).

To do a \"reset\" and go back over the fundamental stuff (using a different source to change up the perspective a bit). I don't know anything about Greek, but assuming that [Language Transfer's Greek course](https://www.languagetransfer.org/free-courses-1#greek) is anywhere near as good as the Spanish one (it should be, the dude is a Cypriot), then I'd recommend going through that (if you haven't already).\n\n2. (Most importantly) to find some sources of *comprehensible* (i.e. beginner/intermediate level) input, preferably in the form of video (for the added context), and consume it regularly. e.g: [Greek Peppa Pig](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkiXi3X7fGie4Now_0a5vtA). Even if material at that level is hard to find, you can look into doing crosstalk, or just getting a tutor who can tell you stories, chat (in Greek), etc. Apps like Duolingo and other courses shouldn't be automatically written off either, sometimes it's good just to have that progressive structure, as long as there are plenty of full sentences/examples/dialog. The point is that any grammar and vocab study you do won't really become cemented in your mind (at least not in a way where it's intuitive) until you hear/read it in various contexts, each time reinforcing your understanding a little.\n\nIf output at this stage is important to you, my recommendation would be to start with Pimsleur.", "created_utc": "1624949394.0", "edited": "1624963647.0", "id": "h3ex42f", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_oa00tr", "parent_id": "t3_oa00tr", "score": "3", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "NoInkling", "body": "> wrote memorization\n\n*rote, just FYI", "created_utc": "1624937049.0", "edited": "False", "id": "h3effno", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_o9qlk9", "parent_id": "t1_h3cqt99", "score": "15", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "NoInkling", "body": "I just remember those making the edges too hard because it clamped them so tight.", "created_utc": "1624775090.0", "edited": "False", "id": "h36qzgn", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_o8l2mn", "parent_id": "t1_h35q7a3", "score": "3", "subreddit": "newzealand", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhma"}, {"author": "NoInkling", "body": "Commander is probably going to be overkill when something like [`rl.question` will do](https://nodejs.org/api/readline.html#readline_rl_question_query_options_callback).", "created_utc": "1624766008.0", "edited": "False", "id": "h36em3w", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_o8m3ix", "parent_id": "t1_h35vitp", "score": "1", "subreddit": "node", "subreddit_id": "t5_2reca"}, {"author": "NoInkling", "body": "The cinnamon roll one seemed like an afterthought, it didn't look more appetizing at all.", "created_utc": "1624591974.0", "edited": "False", "id": "h2ygjvd", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_o77m6f", "parent_id": "t1_h2y0ses", "score": "1", "subreddit": "oddlysatisfying", "subreddit_id": "t5_2x93b"}, {"author": "NoInkling", "body": "A????-7J7ZM-5D3EG\n\n???? = if KYLE was spelled with a Q", "created_utc": "1624576880.0", "edited": "False", "id": "h2xomeh", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_o74guh", "parent_id": "t3_o74guh", "score": "1", "subreddit": "FreeGameFindings", "subreddit_id": "t5_30mv3"}, {"author": "NoInkling", "body": "Both/either.\n\nHere's a very informative video about it that I recommend you watch: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2ji9fiz_QU (the latter two-thirds is most relevant)", "created_utc": "1624575085.0", "edited": "False", "id": "h2xleul", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_o771us", "parent_id": "t3_o771us", "score": "11", "subreddit": "learnspanish", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rd6d"}, {"author": "NoInkling", "body": "I think it kinda is?

Even if you use something like Lingopie (or a [free alternative](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/language-learning-with-ne/hoombieeljmmljlkjmnheibnpciblicm?hl=en)) you're likely going to spend way too much time checking and rechecking the translations for words and being confused at the grammar. Don't be tempted to fall back on English subtitles either, they don't help you learn as much as it feels like. In order to make efficient use of your time, you need to already understand a decent proportion of what you're watching/reading/listening to - such material is termed \"comprehensible input\" (or \"CI\"), and is what you should be looking for (as you've intuitively realized).\n\nA good starting point for that is [Dreaming Spanish](https://www.dreamingspanish.com/) (superbeginner/beginner). It's Spain Spanish but don't let that turn you off. Watch at least one video a day, whatever other resources you may be using. Don't worry about understanding the dictionary meaning of every single word, the point is learning through context and building intuition - the theory people call this \"acquiring\" the language as opposed to \"learning\" it.\n\nLots of input over time is a prerequisite for eventual fluency, but outside of that you're kinda free to choose where to spend the rest of your effort. Some diehard input people will say not to study grammar or vocab, and to not even try and speak at this point, because bad habits and wrong ideas may become fossilized (hard to change later) and affect your accent, your mental models, etc. There's probably some truth to that, but it's a hard thing to ask of people who are excited to learn and develop a new skill. Often learning a grammar point even at just the very surface level can go a long way to helping your comprehension when you encounter it, and therefore facilitates acquiring a deeper intuitive understanding. Similar with looking up an unknown word in the dictionary. I'm guessing you're not here to subscribe wholesale to an ideology anyway, so if you want to use more \"active learning\" resources my opinion is to go for it - almost everyone does.\n\nSo with that out of the way, some beginner resources that are commonly recommended:\n\n- Pimsleur (which you're already using) is a good way to kickstart conversational practice before doing so with real people becomes practical. Because you're trying to mimic the native speakers exactly, it helps develop a good accent in the formative stages of speaking. The hardest part is when the novelty wears off and you have to retain interest through half an hour of pretty dry material every day. If you start to find it a slog, it's probably not worth forcing yourself to complete additional levels. Overall it's kinda hit-or-miss, depending on the learner.\n\n- [Language Transfer Spanish](https://www.languagetransfer.org/free-courses-1#complete-spanish) - Highly regarded intro course to the language, covering basic grammar and vocab.\n\n- Duolingo - It's fun and its gamification provides some external motivation. Spanish course has a decent amount of content, main strength is vocabulary building. Sentence discussions can be very helpful sometimes (but there can also be misinformation). Main lesson voices are TTS which isn't ideal. \"Stories\" serve as good beginner/intermediate input - you can even make use of them while avoiding the main lessons, if you want.\n\n- Assimil - If you want a workbook this is usually what's recommended. Comes with audio.\n\nThe following offer input for learners, but are probably better suited to a high beginner/low intermediate level:  \n\n- Destinos - Story and acting are alright (for a production intended for the classroom), the settings are varied, but in many places it's slow and repetitive. The workbook likely isn't worth it as there are better options (see above).\n\n- extr@ (extra) Spanish - Major cheese. Can be found on Youtube.\n\n- [Mi Vida Loca](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcxCtNrk-cy3afCz7taNj3w) - There used to be an interactive version on the BBC site with extra footage, but that's defunct since Flash died. Relatively short but quality production.\n\nSince you're in California I'm sure you can find plenty of other sources of input, whether that be media or people IRL. Even something that's low-comprehensibility is better than nothing.\n\nBuena suerte.", "created_utc": "1621864693.0", "edited": "False", "id": "gz9udzl", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_njntdi", "parent_id": "t3_njntdi", "score": "4", "subreddit": "Spanish", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qtt1"}, {"author": "NoInkling", "body": "> if it's a movie I haven't seen before, I put on captions in English\n\nAvoid doing this as much as possible\\*, your brain will subconsciously use it as a shortcut and you won't learn much (there have been studies done).

So if you subscribe to that premise, then you're not necessarily looking for a jump in difficulty (at least not a big one), you just kinda need material close to that level.\n\nI feel you though, it's hard to find intermediate resources to bridge the gap. Here are a some Youtube channels/videos (entirely in Spanish) that might help, if you weren't already aware of them:\n\n- [A couple of programs from the BBC](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcxCtNrk-cy3afCz7taNj3w) - Mi Vida Loca is great (watch the version with Spanish commentary). Unfortunately it cuts out some bits that were in the original interactive version (which died when Flash did), but no biggie.\n- [Dreaming Spanish](https://www.dreamingspanish.com/?level=intermediate.advanced) - Highly recommended. I've linked to the \"intermediate\" + \"advanced\" videos here, but you can likely get value out of the beginner ones too. Covers enough topics that at least *some* of them should be interesting to you.\n- [Linguriosa](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoT2EhKDzP6kjTdIMD1vInw) - Topics about the language itself, but actually interesting and well-presented.\n- [Espa\u00f1ol con Juan](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoHJ7PkM6T92LwgJgrnDhWA)\n- [Deliberate Spanish](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzr7FsXkETYaaHTySIeJsjQ) (formerly NachoTime Spanish)\n- [WhyNotSpanish](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIdFcLCIJQ_YMrormG_nU8w)\n- [Spanish After Hours](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfG2VhlQgy5bHGmkpeKcjVA) (not sure why, but her voice/style makes me feel sleepy - I guess the channel name is apt)\n- [SOL School of Language](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoodrxEfqxYH3zhB9l5dwkg)\n- [Spanish Input](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9F6LoCQQrnRlwMwBMkdhyQ)\n- [Easy Spanish](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAL4AMMMXKxHDu3FqZV6CbQ) (only if you can find a way to block out the English subs)\n- [How to Learn Spanish](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmSElpplqOqmAHi1N0z42AQ) - A lot of the videos are grammar/vocab explanations, but there are others too, and they also have a [podcast channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCB48D9vFzR2OKW53uI4q5Aw) where the topics may be more interesting.\n- [No Hay Tos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCY08wLn8NUT8KEdFAV83JWw) podcast - Again mostly explanations.\n- [Spanish with Lex](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTyaTexqROZ_v1hWXXbwHEA) - Mostly explanations.\n- [Destinos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWILG6WW1sl-xk1BX4pSbPLdGve9mefit) - There's also an [official site](https://www.learner.org/series/destinos-an-introduction-to-spanish/) but I can't get the videos to play. A kinda infamous series made for classrooms. Very slow, boring, and repetitive in places, but the story and acting are okish, and location variety is decent. Contains English narration at first, but it disappears as the episodes progress.\n- Sol y Viento [1](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0b-YLCpIh5YM9RGmLXrGOa_OJxSY8GYe) [2](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1y_3OTCxPtXdZYpZI8ntzg) - Film divided into episodes that's in the same vein as the above, except more terrible (at least I believe - I've only seen snippets). Contains some English. Not sure if it's worth anyone's time but I'm throwing it in anyway.\n\nAimed at native speakers, but clear and relatively easy to understand (little-to-no slang):\n\n- [Kurzgesagt Spanish](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZcvCpFcLxOKGbMocVgLjEA)\n- [CuriosaMente](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCX16cLWl6dCjlZMgUBxgGkA)\n- [BBC Mundo](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUBIrDsIVzRpKsClMlSlTpQ)\n\nIf you want proper TV programming or movies aimed at natives: animation and comedies aimed at adults or older teens are difficult because they tend to have quite a lot of fast speech, slang, and wordplay. If you can tolerate it, you'll probably want to be looking for stuff where children are the primary audience for a little while. As far as Youtube goes, you can try:\n\n- [Peppa Pig](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrreHSUa5rnuCVDeO8dX4eA) - With [24/7 stream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hl_nACnH42w). Holds some universal charm and episodes are short bites, so easy to consume. Vocab isn't dumbed-down to the point that it's useless.\n\nBut for something a bit more compelling (and difficult) you could look for dubs of stuff like Dragon Ball (Latino dub recommended), Avatar (La leyenda de Aang), Spongebob, etc. Whatever floats your boat, the most important thing is that it holds your interest at least somewhat.\n\nIf you're looking for an adult film that's *relatively* easy to understand, you can try [El Hoyo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Platform_(film\\)) and see how you go. Be warned that it's very dark. You should be able to find it on Netflix.\n\nIf anyone else has any other channels or resources/recommendations to add for (pure Spanish) comprehensible input at an intermediate level, I'd appreciate them too.", "created_utc": "1621820738.0", "edited": "1621824213.0", "id": "gz87cnv", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_nj9let", "parent_id": "t1_gz7f5rp", "score": "12", "subreddit": "Spanish", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qtt1"}, {"author": "NoInkling", "body": "It's an old API, I very much doubt they'd go with a bitmask design these days.\n\nTechnically, if we're trying to be less verbose, `133` (or `0b10000101`) is even shorter!

Some (like Ruby on Rails) can encrypt them for you too. There's nothing really stopping you from storing data in them just like you would a JWT. In fact, frameworks and session libraries often use this cookie storage by default (even in the Node ecosystem, e.g: [koa-session](https://github.com/koajs/session), [express cookie-session](https://github.com/expressjs/cookie-session)); this is arguably a better default than an in-memory store since that can grow to an arbitrary size. Of course, you can also just store a JWT in a cookie, which has the advantage of being standardized in terms of claims and signing algorithms etc.\n\n>     Cookie: USER_ID=123\n> But this is very insecure. The information lives in the browser, which means users can change USER_ID and be identified as a different user.\n\nNot if the cookie is signed, which it should be regardless of whether you're using a user ID or an opaque session ID.\n\n> Instead of a predictable user id, we\u2019re sending the client a completely random session id that is impossibly hard to guess.\n\nThat shouldn't be your primary defense against tampered cookies though, that's what signing is for. The fact that the token is not easily guessable does serve as defense in depth, but that property just happens to be complementary to that of being opaque. The other, probably more important reasons you might want an opaque token instead of a user ID are:\n\n1. You consider a permanent identifier like the user ID sensitive, and want to avoid exposing it on the client in any way (although this is also where encryption could potentially come in). Of course this ties back into the predictability thing.\n\n2.

You have password (`md5`) authentication enabled for TCP/IP (`host`) connections from localhost, but also from any IPv4 address because you're specifying `/0` for the bit mask in the last two lines (bad idea, but leave it for now because it helps diagnose). If you have any user **with a password already set** (once again, you can check the `pg_shadow` table), you should be able to run `psql -U <username> -h localhost <dbname>` and it should prompt you for a password for that user. The `-h localhost` part forces a connection via TCP/IP, because unix socket is the default for psql (run `psql --help` to show the default host/port/username/dbname it tries to use). If that works, then MikroORM should work when using that username, password and dbname. If it doesn't, then restart the Postgres server to ensure the current configuration has been applied (`sudo service postgresql restart`), and if it still doesn't work, then it's almost definitely a connectivity problem.\n\n2. You also have password authentication enabled for the `postgres` user when connecting via unix socket (`local`). **If** `postgres` **has a password set**, then you should be able to connect with `psql -U postgres <dbname>`. If not then it shouldn't work. Not really relevant to MikroORM as it seems to connect over TCP/IP by default, so you can just use #1 instead.\n\n3. You have `peer` authentication enabled. This has basically the same effect as I was previously describing with `ident`, but only works over unix socket. This is what allows you to run `psql <dbname>`. If there's a way to make MikroORM connect over unix socket instead of TCP/IP, then it could use this, assuming Node.JS is running on the Linux side under the same Ubuntu user. It's impossible if it's running on the Windows side though. Usually this method would also enable `sudo -u postgres psql` to work (runs psql as `postgres` Ubuntu user), but I think in this case it would match #2 instead (because it's higher in the list) - you can try it though, or else uncomment the top line in pg_hba.conf.\n\nSo if you've determined it's a connectivity problem, I can only assume that you're running Node.js from the Windows side rather than the Linux side (it would be nice if you actually confirmed), because I see no reason for it to happen with the latter. WSL2 is apparently supposed to have localhost forwarding, but it's not available in older builds and I think sometimes people have issues with it. You can try following the instructions here to see if MikroORM works when using the VMs actual IP instead: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/compare-versions#accessing-network-applications    \nThere are some other considerations there that are worth reading. It looks like the connection from the host may indeed be considered external, which you already accounted for. As a last-ditch effort you could try `0.0.0.0/32` instead of the addresses you currently have in the bottom lines of pg_hba.conf (again, remember to restart the Postgres server after changes).\n\nIf you happen to be using Docker or something then I can't offer any advice.\n\nr/bashonubuntuonwindows might be able to offer advice if all this fails.\n\nPersonally, this is one of the reasons I stick to WSL1 and just use a Windows install of Postgres in development.", "created_utc": "1620439760.0", "edited": "1620444385.0", "id": "gxcfmyt", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_n61121", "parent_id": "t1_gxb9zot", "score": "1", "subreddit": "PostgreSQL", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qvw7"}, {"author": "NoInkling", "body": "> There is literally no mechanism you could implement to void a token that doesn't lead you back to keeping state somewhere you can delete / void.\n\nThere are single value nuclear options though, the most obvious being invalidating the signing key. Other than that you're right of course (no need to repeat yourself), hence the typical compromise of a refresh token scheme. The short-lived JWT is stateless, the longer-lived refresh token isn't. This kind of scheme is generally assumed.\n\n> How? It doesn't even let you change the user state. To update profile information for the user you would need to login again (passing credentials again, so bad) just to obtain a new profile encoded in the token.\n\nWith a valid refresh token, a new JWT can be issued at any time without reentering credentials. I'll admit the benefit of this one is a little dubious because if you need to call a dedicated endpoint to be issued a JWT, then that's no better than having to call an endpoint for profile information with cookies. So this is moreso an advantage over opaque tokens. However there are alternative ways of issuing a JWT that may be appropriate in certain circumstances, and in those you might be able to save a request compared to cookies.\n\n> It does nothing to protect against CSRF as I could compromise your token and pass it to the server to impersonate you, and the most your server could say is \"Yup, this token originated from the authentication server\"\n\nYou're not describing a CSRF attack though. Yes, obtaining the token via XSS or another means makes CSRF moot, but that's not the point being made, which is that if you're not using cookies, no CSRF mitigation is needed for authenticated requests.\n\n> How? Non browser clients are able to pass tokens of any kind (JWT or otherwise).\n\nYes I already pointed that out myself. The comparison is to cookies.\n\n> I don't think your users are going to care your database is being hammered, but they are going to care if they want to logout and can't.\n\nAre you talking about logging out remotely? Because locally it's trivial. Remotely you invalidate the refresh token on the server, but you would indeed have to wait for the last-issued JWT to expire to be sure (which is why it's short-lived).\n\nAnyway, don't shoot the messenger. I'm not suggesting that the reasoning for using stateless JWTs is particularly good or worth the downsides, which I'm well aware of personally (as well as that article and its followup).

If you want, since this is presumably just for development, you should just be able to provide this username to your ORM and have it work (you can use `process.env.USER` instead of hardcoding it).\n\nThere's also the `postgres` user and role that gets created, which [according to the documentation](https://mikro-orm.io/docs/configuration#connection) is what your ORM tries to use by default (although usually it's best to reserve it for administrative operations). The reason it can't connect is because you're not running your program under that user account, so it can't use ident authentication, and also the role has no password set by default, so password authentication won't work even if `pg_hba.conf` is set up to use it.
