than enough to make it clear that you are not consenting to sex. even if you didn't say anything, she has no right to have sex with you unless you enthusiastically say yes. sometimes people freeze out of fear, or go along with it because of pressure, but it's 100% still rape. my heart goes out to you. i don't have kids yet, but i know to never stay in an unhappy relationship/marriage for kids. lots of parents do better living apart than together and their kids are happier as a result. no kid wants to see their parents unhappy together. i think you know what happened was absolutely unacceptable and that you deserve someone who respects your body and boundaries. this woman is a rapist. stay strong and trust in yourself to make the right decision.", "created_utc": "1620429603.0", "edited":

It was completely online and I never got to go to Toronto or York campuses, unfortunately.

It\u2019s possible that this Fall semester will be mostly online too, but we will have to see how everything ends up.\n\nMy advice:\n- join Facebook groups for York students (Incoming class of 2021, Current York Students etc.) and read through the posts by other students + interact with posts\n\n- join WhatsApp groups for each of your classes. this is honestly something that really helped me, if i have a question i can ask it in the group chat and someone is bound to answer. also, you\u2019ll become familiar with certain people that way. it\u2019s not easy to make online friends for me because i\u2019d much rather hang out in person, but it\u2019s a start\n\n- there\u2019s also a discord server for York if you\u2019re more into that, but it can be kinda overwhelming in my opinion\n\n- most profs and TA are good at their job and will help you if you reach out. there\u2019s always shitty profs and TAs (such as the Myanmar incident) but there\u2019s honestly plenty of lovely staff at York, so don\u2019t worry, someone will help you\n\n- as for managing time and coursework, you\u2019ll find out a schedule that works for you as the semester unfolds (for me it\u2019s literally do everything the night before, don\u2019t recommend btw)\n\n- follow other students you see in group chats on social media, they typically follow back and try interacting with them here and there, even if it\u2019s harder online, it still helps to try and socialize\n\nThat\u2019s all I can think of for now, but now you got me thinking I should make a post about some advice so every new-comer can read it.
