The \"three-wing theory\" holds that there are three main branches of politics: Liberals (classical liberals, neoliberals, libertarians) Conservatives (monarchists, fascists and theocrats) and Leftists (anarchists, communists, socialists). In terms of economics, there are three wings of politics, not two.\n\nThe dominant cultural ideology in our modern era is liberalism, so it would make sense that over-socialized people would become liberals. In school and TV, we are constantly propagandized with liberal messages (LGBT, Feminism, antiRacism).\n\nActual leftism (which advocates worker control of the means of production) is not the social norm, thus it is mostly impossible for someone to be \"socialized\" into leftism.\n\nLiberals (such as AOC) are almost certainly over-socialized into the current value system. Leftists (such as Subcomandante Marcos) are not.\n\nStrange enough, Ted Kaczynski himself is a leftist. He opposes the accumulation of capital (a \"surrogate activity\") and derives much of his ideas from leftist texts.

Kaczynski's idea that people are removed from the power process is a direct parallel to the Marxist theory of alienation. The concept of \"Surrogate activities\" is a strikingly similar to Guy Debord's writing on commodity and spectacle. Ted's anxieties about reduced freedom due to technology is in a similar vein to early anarchist modes of thought.\n\nKaczynski also engages in armchair psychology, lumping liberals and leftists together and claiming that anyone who is not right wing was \"oversocialized\".

Many of the founding fathers had large agricultural plots farmed by slaves. America had a slave underclass that was somewhat similar to serfdom Wealthy whites at the top (akin to the lords) and black slaves were at the bottom (akin to serfs).\n\nThis quasi-feudal hierarchy persisted for decades. It wasn't until the spread of the industrial revolution in the early 1800s that the economic structure of the country began to change. Middle-class free whites and European immigrants became extraordinarily wealthy by purchasing industrial machinery and starting businesses. These nouveau-riche industrialists grew their wealth and power and eventually began to rival the established agricultural lords. To this day, much of the \"american elites\" are descended from these northern industrial dynasties.\n\nThe south was slow to industrialize for a variety of reasons, and the large-scale shift away from feudal-style agriculture to industry did not come until after the civil war. By the 1860s, there was a clear economic divide between the north and the south. This division is apparent in [maps of railway](http://gorhistory.com/hist110/MapRR1860.png) from the era.\n\nAt the start of the civil war, there was a tangible  division between the upper classes of the north and the south. The bourgeois landholders of the south began to drift away from the industrialised north. It seemed as if the  north and the south were two different countries. A manifestation of this difference was the two different moral policies regarding slavery. The slavery-dependent south justified their economic status through pro-slavery ideology. The northern industrialists did not rely on slavery and instead used on immigrant wage workers. Northern elites espoused classical liberal anti-slavery pro-industry ideology. The dispute over slavery was a symbol for the economic divides in the United States.\n\nSome of the southern elite did not want to pay tax and owe loyalty to the vastly different north. The southern Slave-owning bourgeois feared that their power in government would be displaced by the new northern industrial tycoons. The southern ruling class believed that the federal government was weak and that any potential war against the north would be won quickly and easily.\n\nThe reality of the civil war was much different. The Southern rebellion was defeated after a crushing four year blockade. The war ended with a strengthened federal government and slaveowners being let go unpunished. After the war, the US went through the second industrial revolution and became the sole power in the Western hemisphere.\n\nThis is not taught in American schools for many reasons. The economic analysis is longer and more complex, and would take more resources to fully explore. Analyzing the civil war through an economic lens might also encourage students to economically analyze current conflicts and struggles as well\n\nEDIT: this was an extremely short summary of a very complex historical-economic situation.
