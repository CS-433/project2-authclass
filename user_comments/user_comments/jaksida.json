Development and balance is hard for fighting games so the base roster of a new game is usually a mix of fan favourites and new characters. There aren\u2019t many fighting games out there with every legacy character unfortunately!\n\nGG AC+R is the final edition of an older game, so it doesn\u2019t have any DLC and is very cheap. Strive is a game currently being developed, and like many modern fighting games, updates are added for free and new characters are sold in seasons. Bridget was made for the game after it launched, she wasn\u2019t excluded just to make more money. It works out to be less expensive than buying a new Guilty Gear Strive every time the game gets updated with new mechanics or characters.\n\nYou can always wait for the game\u2019s price to go down, especially when the game stops receiving season passes but the unfortunate trade-off is the game will likely be harder to find online matches.", "created_utc": "1660121261.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ijp1a2k", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_wkr2is", "parent_id": "t3_wkr2is", "score": "13", "subreddit": "Guiltygear", "subreddit_id": "t5_2tiga"}, {"author": "jaksida", "body": "I like to imagine that there are people online in Japan going \u201cbut-but it\u2019s the Japanese lore writers forcing their own politics into a character!!

MensLib views feminism isn't something that's directely opposed to men getting treated properly. MensLib people would identify as feminists. Your average MensLib person wants to critically examine masculinity and find ways of address the toxic aspects while celebrating what they find good about masculinity. You'd get downvoting for suggesting toxic masculinity isn't a thing. Your average MensLib member thinks that women are the more oppressed gender but men still issues of their own.\n\nIf MensRights people believe high suicide rates are something that can be solved by reverting to a more traditional standard of masculinity, MensLib believes in redefining masculinity to allow men to be more emotionally open and providing support for them as a solution.", "created_utc": "1616171263.0", "edited": "1616193609.0", "id": "grhudtg", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_lqkee1", "parent_id": "t3_lqkee1", "score": "1", "subreddit": "MensRights", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhk3"}, {"author": "jaksida", "body": "Any community that builds their own netcode and has no issue hosting their events in the most bizarre of venues gets all of our respect.", "created_utc": "1616145104.0", "edited": "False", "id": "grgnjjh", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_m808nc", "parent_id": "t1_grfq2tu", "score": "33", "subreddit": "Fighters", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s5rz"}, {"author": "jaksida", "body": "Toxic masculinity is just as harmful to men as it is to women.

Although I understand that the wording of \u201cunreported\u201d sounds vague, it explains how it reaches that figure. Essentially in cases of rapes/sexual assaults reported to crisis lines and other resources, victims decline more often than not to have it filed as a police report. More depressingly you can fall down the rabbit hole of how many of these rape cases garner an actual conviction. Sexual assault notoriously difficult to prosecute someone for.\n\nProtecting your daughters is very much just treating the symptoms of a larger illness. Giving victims the ability to protect themselves should they need it is helpful but that\u2019s not addressing the source of the problem itself, the perpetrators. Like I said, education and speaking out against shitty behaviour plays an important role in this. The importance of consent and how you should treat sexual partners is something that should be better emphasised when taught. Education is very much the long term solution we should be aiming for.\n\nWe can deal with issues within our own masculinity even if you think these sorts of problems exist in femininity too. Anecdotally I know far more men who objectify women as sex objects to be conquered than the other way around. These sorts of negative aspects that we need to be critical about masculinity harm other men just as much as they do women.\n\nI would also like to clarify that I\u2019m not trying to be hostile though I understand my initial comment comes off as a bit standoffish.
