I said:\n\n>Modern linguistics show that *a natural accelerator to getting reading fluency is by getting spoken fluency first (although there's a lot of debate on how important it is that you actually speak, what's crucial is that you hear tons of comprehensible input)*.\n\n**I at no point said, suggested or implied that there's any evidence that getting the speaking ability is a** ***sine qua non condition*** **for getting reading fluency**.\n\nI profoundly apologize for not being precise here, as I said, there's a tremendous amount of debate about what parts of the brain work in the process of developing and using listening and speaking skills and exactly how they interact with one another. On the one hand there's actual evidence of people that cannot speak (physically cannot speak) are still able to learn languages (see [Lenneberg](https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Fh0041906)) on the other hand there's a lot of academics (mainly [Swain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merrill_Swain) but also people like [Izumi](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/288260459), [Panell](https://www.hpu.edu/research-publications/tesol-working-papers/2017/2017-new-with-metadata/06pannellpartschfuller_output.pdf) and [Liming](https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ420159.pdf)) that show a lot of data that strongly suggests that it's very important to speak, but even that data is hard to interpret.\n\nIn a significant number of cases of people that for whatever reason are not able or willing to speak, their brain still works in an incredibly similar way it works in those people that actually speak once they reached a significant level of fluency. So, it's really complicated and, as counter-intuitive as it sounds, \"spoken fluency\" (understood what your brain is doing while speaking/listening) without speaking might not be as meaningless as you think. \\[And it's not really that weird, people that have lost an arm or foot still experience pain or pleasure in those non-existent members, their brain simply operates as if their arm or foot still existed\\].\n\nThat's the reason why I, imprudently (I admit) used the wording \"spoken fluency\" as a catch-all-term for both listening and spoken skills. I apologize for that, the misunderstanding is on me.\n\n>I'm suggesting that whenever someone so confidently places emphasis on the **need** to attain spoken fluency first, particularly in the context of Latin,\n\nOnce again, I did not emphasise the **need** of spoken fluency, but it's desirability in ideal situations. Something that I stand firmly behind (after having admitted the imprudence of not nuancing what I meant by \"spoken fluency\", let us here better speak of the \"listening fluency that is comes from constant exposure to the quantity and quality of input that usually comes from a fluent speaker EDIT: and that appears to be aided or enhanced by  speaking\").\n\n>may deter folks without the necessary opportunities or resources from developing perfectly adequate pleasure and ability in reading Latin purely from a book.\n\nThat is a risk that we must live with and be honest about it. In my school the piano teacher faces the dire situation that there's no piano in the school and none of the students has access to a piano at home. They have to take the bus to a nearby town where a retired pianist kindly allows them to use his two pianos once a month. So each student has an average of 15min actual practice time a month. They usually practice using a piece of cardboard with they keys painted on them.\n\nI don't really need to tell you how inefficient that is. But it would be an act of dereliction of duty not to be honest with the students and tell them that their performance will be the same as of those students that do have access to a piano. It is in fact a good idea to tell them how hard and inefficient it will be, it will not be impossible, but it will be far from the ideal situation.\n\nIn order try and palliate the inequality of opportunities I and many of the teachers in the discord give free classes every once in a while, and there's a lot of voluntary tutors that aid all self-learners, also for free.\n\n>Is it also a barrier which people simply do not need to surmount in order to enjoy reading Latin? Yup.\n\nI agree that, technically, it may not be needed, just like having a piano is not needed to learn to play the piano. But just as you can see having a piano as a barrier you can also see it as an ideal accelerator that makes everything faster, funnier and more interactive.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nRegarding AVN. I know what their webpage says, and it's not the only thing that is stated in their webpage that does not really reflect the reality.

There are many other factors that affect these things. The example you mention is actually perfect, French pronunciation is indeed an obstacle (for some people, notably Anglophones) that has been analyzed over and over (at least since [Clark 1967](https://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED016426) all the way to [Sturm 2019](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/flan.12376?casa_token=LGjzP1etLnsAAAAA%3A6lIZM__0nl5I_zw16aAXsxlvtO7msenH4zqhXbhU-Xuqnp00V0Ld07_UECzUJg26ey42y8dvDm6KewY)) the resources to this topic are immense so I won't bother giving the details, my point is: You have here an extra factor that complicates things, it moreover it combines with other non measurable factors that are the emotional reactions from the learners. Of course if you're an insecure student that has difficulties pronouncing French you will not develop the speaking skills needed to speak fluently; that does not mean that you won't understand. It is perfectly reasonable that you will focus on other skills like listening or writing and that you will be far better at those than in merely speaking. That is perfectly normal, but it does not invalidate the observed principle that getting you brain fluent listening proficiency will naturally accelerate the reading proficiency.\n\n>\"what's crucial is that you hear tons of comprehensible input\" - seriously? For Latin?\n\nYes, seriously. The best way to combat dehydration is by drinking liquids, just because you happen to be short on liquids, does not invalidate the truth that that would be the best way to go about it.\n\n>The only way you're gonna get that is to board for a year at the Accademia Vivarium Novum. Let's hope you're male, and a fan of a fairly conservative lifestyle. Oh, and you have to know Latin already.\n\nTurns out that I am a former Vivarium Student, that's were I learned. (And no I do not like or live a \"conservative lifestyle\" hence my personal difficulties while in there, but that's beside the point). And no, you do not have to know Latin already to go there, I went in there as a complete novice, I did not even know what a declension was. As a matter of fact most of my classmates were also complete novices, that's precisely why I was able to observe in the years I was there that despite any previous knowledge of Latin (we got usually many BA students, but also MAs or even an occasional PhD student), after six to eight months we were all on the same level, the same thing happened over an over with the next generations I could observe.\n\nAlso, we live in the fantastic world were access to Latin has become increasingly easy, there's an ever growing number of podcasts and schools (with online classes) often very affordable (like Like [Paideia Institute](https://www.paideiainstitute.org), [Polis](https://www.polisjerusalem.org/), [Vivarium Novum](https://vivariumnovum.net/), [Schola Latina](https://scholalatina.it/), [Classics at Home](https://classicsathome.com/), [Grecolatinovivo](https://www.grecolatinovivo.it/), [Schola Nova](https://www.scholanova.be/index.php/en), [Schola Humanistica](https://www.scholahumanistica.com/),  [Collegium Latinitatis](https://collegiumlatinitatis.com/), [Schola Classica](https://www.scholaclassica.com/), [Studium Angelopolitanum](https://studiumangelopolitanum.wordpress.com/), [Kantonsschule Solothurn](https://ksso.so.ch/bildungsangebot/gymnasium/schwerpunktfaecher/latein/), [Am\u00e1rantos](https://www.facebook.com/circulus.mexicopolitanus), [La Academia](https://sites.google.com/site/latinvivoenmadrid/la-academia), [GraecoLatinum](https://www.facebook.com/GraecoLatinumCursos), [Schola Sorbonae](https://www.facebook.com/ScholaSorbonae/), [Schola Latina II](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrilvywYbcc),  [St. Theresa Catholic School](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6pER6empz8), etc.), we have the two discord channels, and a lot of high quality YouTube material which you can consult in lieu of a local Latin speaker. (See the FAQ for a small list of these resources).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>If I (for yes, I am one of the people I'm speaking about) had waited to gain \"spoken fluency first\" before reading extensively,\n\nNobody claimed that you necessarily had to wait to get spoken fluency first before beginning an extensive reading. This is science, not religion, of course if you're on an island and you have no access to other resources but a single book, that single book will be (in those circumstances) the best resource.\n\nWhat the science has shown is that: In ideal, lab tested situations, people that in the beginners to intermediate stages were exposed to spoken comprehensible input and developed listening/speaking proficiency were able to archive reading/writing proficiency way faster than the people who were only exposed to written material.\n\nThat does not mean that focusing on reading is bad in any way, just that it is not (ironically) the most effective way to acquire reading fluency. As counter-intuitive as that may sound, that's what the experiments (see the Burth video and handout) show.\n\n>when I say 'extensive reading', I am referring to the type of reading that can only be done once some form of reading fluency has been achieved.\n\nTurns out that [Extensive reading](http://indwellinglanguage.com/the-inescapable-case-for-extensive-reading/) is already a technical term, it means reading a great amount of easy texts (aka text whose content you already know at 90%). And it is one of the aspects pretty much everyone advocates for. The fact remains that the most effective way to get that reading fluency that you say it's needed to do \"intensive reading\" is getting spoken fluency (or at the very least hearing fluency; again, there's a lot of very technical debate on the role of actually speaking, but there's no real argument against it). Of course if you have no access to the necessary material, the next best thing will be what's at hand.

Yes (specially in an academic context), but it's not an immediate necessity for the purposes of getting reading fluency at a beginner/ lower intermediate level.

My hypothesis are: \n\n1) Usually self-learners are very bad at self-evaluating so they probably believe they've mastered the content of FR, but they have not.\n\n1.2) Usually people that present problems confess that they have not done neither the pensa nor the exercitia, so there's no real testing of the acquired skills.\n\n2) Usually the people that present problems are monolingual, it is a well known fact that breaking monolingualism is very hard, Latin is probably not the easiest option to start as a second language, specially without professional guidance.  \n\n3) Probably the most important: comprehensible input. The fact that my students get to hear me speaking Latin all time and that I force them to speak in real-life situations (thus they get to hear each other speak) and are forced to react to real meaningful interactions must be the most important factor, as reacting appropriately is in itself a sort of test. This is in keeping with my observation that the self-learners in the Discord channels that learn the most effectively, are the ones that actively participate in the conversations and begin receiving feedback from the very beginning.\n\n4) I don't believe that \"grammar explanations\" (aka an English explicit explanation of what's going on) is a missing factor as I never provide those; what I usually do is ask questions or give synonyms or paraphrases without explanations until the students \"get it\" and begin imitating the desired structure: \n\n\\-Habetne Marcus unam sororem? \n\n\\-Ita, Marcus habet unam sororem.\n\n\\-Quid? Estne Marco una soror?\n\n\\-Ita, Marcus habet unam sororem.\n\n\\-Quid? Estne Marco una soror?\n\n\\-Ita, Marco est una soror.\n\n\\-Estne Iulio una filia?\n\n\\-Ita, Iulio est una filia.\n\nAnd so on. Only when I'm satisfied that the student has on his own internalized the new vocabulary/structure do I provide an explanation (in Latin), but only as a confirmation, never as a first step. This is up for debate, but I suspect that the average monolingual self-learner does not realize the importance of this step in the learning process (which honestly it can be hard enough with a teacher, it is probably even more complicated, but not impossible, as a self-learner) and excessively relies on the Companion or the Latine disco, which is why I discourage them; they are there as a confirmation step, not as a first-aid kit. [Llewellyn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adv_lbelCJk) has also concluded that this is a problem which is why she banned both the Companion and the Latine disco in her classes. I don't believe that as a self learner you should never consult them, but I would recommend the Latine disco over the Companion and to do so only as a confirmation step (or in extremely dire situations).\n\nIt a well known fact in SLA that recourse to one's native language gives explicit conscious certainty and thus a bias of security, but that explicit knowledge is not causal to real acquisition, the same way that explicit knowledge of the engineering behind a combustion motor is not causal to learning how to drive, thus excessive reliance on explicit grammar explanations contributes to point 1 (aka: just because you know and understood the rule in English does not mean that you have developed the subconscious skill of applying it in an appropriate situation).\n\nThere's also no memorization of tables in my class, but there is memorization of dialogues, sentences and paragraphs that I have them recite or perform. It is not from the table that they'll get the information but from the memory of an analogous situation in which a particular form, structure or ending was required.\n\n5) I don't really believe supplementary resources to be a contributing factor on themselves because what I use is what, probably, self-learners use: books like Fabulae Faciles, Ad Alpes, Ora maritima, Nutting's Reader, etc. \n\n\\*An important point in here, the self-learner is exposed to low quality novellas that have all sort of imprecisions or mistakes that can go from bad style to outright basic grammar errors. Even teachers knowledgeable of SLA that are, I think, doing a good faith effort to provide material for learners do not always have the necessary knowledge of Latin to provide a minimum of quality (Aka: just because they know that you need to practice driving and not engineering to learn how to drive, does not mean that they themselves know how to drive). \n\n6) Other imponderable factors: How disciplined or diligent is the student? Can he study without being hungry, tired or stressed? There's just to many variables on the personal situations of each individual that can significantly impact the learning progress. Just the fact of having a single study-room or access to a library will have make a tremendous difference in contrast to having to study next to your living room while someone watches TV or plays videogames. Even with a teacher the kid that's worried because his has three jobs or because his mom has cancer will simply not be able to perform as well as he would like. Self-learners are not an homogeneous group, thus there are likely other factors involved.\n\n7) When doing the transition from FA to RA any and all of the above mentioned factors may combine, or it could simply be that having a teacher help with the transition (see point 4) is in itself a factor.", "created_utc": "1657031659.0", "edited": "False", "id": "iey39f7", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_vrknd9", "parent_id": "t1_iewsrib", "score": "3", "subreddit": "latin", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qloa"}, {"author": "Indeclinable", "body": "Indeed, [AVN.it](https://AVN.it) is down, no idea why.", "created_utc": "1657026654.0", "edited": "False", "id": "iexsfx5", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_vrknd9", "parent_id": "t1_iexi024", "score": "1", "subreddit": "latin", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qloa"}, {"author": "Indeclinable", "body": "Latin teacher here, it is a popular misconception that LLPSI is made for speaking or composition, it is not.

Yes, you may argue that there's a bubble of well-off people in Buenos Aires, Santiago or Mexico City that is more interested in culture than in the rest of the provinces, but here you deal with the historical/cultural problem.\n\nLatinamerican history is basically civil war/coups between a Liberal and a Conservative faction (with different motives, shades and local power struggles in each specific country). In most countries the Liberal faction ended up winning (eventually) and decided that it was not a good idea to allow the Church to have influence on the education programs so they eliminated Greek and Latin as official courses; in the few unfortunate countries that had a conservative dictator or military junta, Latin became associated with it and it never got rid of the whole Latin=Church=Conservative government/dictatorship aura. Those elites that are interested in culture are usually very liberal are very suspicious of the whole Latin thing; they follow a tradition of a love/hate relationship with the USA and an almost mystic admiration for Europe, so they are more interested in English, French or Italian (or German if you're from Paraguay or Argentina, for... reasons... no comment there). Most of the people that are really into Latin do so out of a deeply religious conviction that clashes with the liberal mentality of the big cities. There's no tradition of \"secular Latin\" like in Germany, France or the UK, where Latin is just one subject more in the curriculum, it can quickly become political.\n\nIf you add the fact the the enormous bibliographic production in Latin made in the Americas was done during Spanish rule (usually with a heavy pro-Spanish message) and that there's usually a latent yet potent Anti-Spanish sentiment hidden between pretty much everybody, you'll see that it's not really a subject you can approach casually. The tendency of the academics circles is to focus their efforts to investigate their national, independent history/literature and leave their colonial past untouched unless you're using it as a source of nationalistic propaganda. \n\nThe good news is that there's a constant flow of students that go to institutions like AVN or Schola Latina, become excellently trained teachers and come back and teach privately (we have to deal with the fact the a significant number of students have an incredibly strong religious sentiment that is simply not shared by the teachers); so I expect the number of people learning Latin to increase, but I would not count on a change in the institutional status of Latin in the school curricula any time soon.", "created_utc": "1655668349.0", "edited": "False", "id": "icz9lqy", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_vfskzp", "parent_id": "t1_icz635r", "score": "5", "subreddit": "latin", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qloa"}, {"author": "Indeclinable", "body": "Short answer: No, it is not common at all in high-school or middle schools to teach Latin or Greek, at all.

Even then the quality and quantity of the teachers they produced is laughable when compared to Europe. It is not until the late 60's that you see European-trained teachers coming into take the role (today AVN is actually the biggest provider of Latin teachers in Latinamerica); but they still face the challenge that neither Greek nor Latin is officially a school subject.\n\nSpain is the odd one out, they had their conservative pro-Church dictator keep the institutions alive, so now that they too have benefited from (mostly) AVN trained teachers occupying those institutional positions and a growing market of Latinamerican private schools demanding more content.

The lack of interest in \"Western Culture\" is indeed a problem, but it's not for the Language teachers alone to address, there are the parents, the history teachers, the literature teachers, and the students themselves (and their socio-economic-cultural context) that have a greater impact on their interest on literature.\n\nPersonally I believe that by getting students to a fluent level (in any language) is already complex enough and that alone leaves them with the tool they need to approach Literature if they so wish.", "created_utc": "1653674356.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ia7y76w", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_uyu7yh", "parent_id": "t1_ia7wp7u", "score": "5", "subreddit": "latin", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qloa"}, {"author": "Indeclinable", "body": "Because it has been proven to be scientifically ineffective (see my answer above).

What factors are involved? Can we improve the process? (The answer is basically \"Comprehensible Input\", you can see the discussions we've had in the past [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/latin/comments/8rp222/is_the_wheelock_latin_textbook_good_for_beginners/), [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/latin/comments/gvqjfh/grammartranslation_vs_reading_method_which_is_the/), [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/latin/comments/n7y6up/do_some_latin_teachers_actually_discourage/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/latin/comments/gca8mq/has_any_of_you_completed_both_lingua_latina_and/))\n\nI'm not exaggerating when I say that Second Language Acquisition theory is to Language teachers what the Theory of Evolution is to biologists, is an incredibly solid and reliable theory that explains pretty much all practical phenomena and allows us to improve (in a practical way) our lives and those of our students.\n\nAnother, completely separate subject, is why we learn languages at all. It has nothing (or very little) to do with how we learn them. As far as I'm aware nobody, not even the most staunch and devote reformists that want to take down Grammar-Translation at all costs (and I count myself as one of them), learns or teaches Latin for the mere pleasure of talking in Latin with others (that's just a very happy side effect). We all learn Latin for the strict and sole purpose of reading what the people of the past wrote (be it Virgil, or Melanchton, or Erasmus or Cicero).\n\nYour concern could be better applied at people that learn modern languages where it is incredibly common to learn English or French for simple communicative purposes, regardless of whatever value French or English culture may have. That simply is not the case with Latin, at all.\n\nNot only a Comprehensible-Input based method allows you to be able to read and understand the Vulgate or Virgil or Cicero or Erasmus, faster and more enjoyably than the alternative. But if you were to torture a student with brute memorization of anything, no matter how valuable or aesthetically beautiful, not only would it take the student longer to learn (if he learns at all) but chances are that the student will end up hating the author in question (it happens very frequently with Caesar and Virgil).\n\nTL,DR: There are two different and unrelated problems. 1) How do we learn a language? 2) Why do we learn a language? The answer to the first question comes from science and it's objective. The answer to the second question is entirely subjective and is not affected at all by the answer to the first question. You can memorize the Vulgate and still not have any \"humanistic values\" (or still not know Latin for that matter).", "created_utc": "1653667481.0", "edited": "1653667950.0", "id": "ia7hkzk", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_uyu7yh", "parent_id": "t3_uyu7yh", "score": "14", "subreddit": "latin", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qloa"}, {"author": "Indeclinable", "body": "u/anglicea I can only endorse wholeheartedly the response Raffaelle has given you.

You will notice that what you wrote is infinitely more specific and nuanced than abstract allegations of the FAQ being \"aggressive\" or \"misleading\", points which OP has yet to defend.\n\nRegarding your 1st point: I cannot argue against your *perception* of things, so I won't, I can only say that a judgement call was made.  The situation of the study of Greek being as it is (with all is many variables across countries worldwide), priority was given to two things: 1) What is the academic consensus among specialists that can be proved via the scientific method regarding language teaching? 2) What variable(s) is determinant in getting a prospective student (often a self-learner) to succeed in acquiring reading fluency as fast as possible with as little difficulties as feasible? All other considerations (including the perception of the FAQ itself) became secondary, hence even if the most asked question were to be \"How do I type Greek in my PC?\" or \"What is an inflected language?\" any of them being, real, relevant and legitimate questions, they did not fit the two criteria mentioned. So while we're open to expanding the resources page, the FAQ has that extra filter of not only gathering the most popular questions, they also have to pass that extra filter. I'll restate so that's clear: it is not a popularity contest, I have no idea what the \"nature of the sub in general\" is but it is not a criteria that was adopted for the FAQ.\n\nYou can of course say that I or any of the other mods are fallible and that our judgement maybe wrong, that is something that only time will decide, for the moment that judgement call stands. As fallible human beings that we are, we are well aware of that the bias of our own personal experiences may cloud our judgement, we're not machines, nor we pretend to be, nobody here is claiming to be omniscient or above human error; but the tipping point is and will remain: Is what's in the FAQ factually and demonstrably wrong? Is it of such decisive importance that could make or brake a student's learning journey?\n\nRegarding your 2nd point: Let us return to the r/Science example, I'm sure that many flatearthers feel rejected and targeted by the very strict regulations in there, but they happen to have the disadvantage of being wrong, as was said, you cannot correct somebody that claims 2+2=5 without sounding at least confrontational.\n\nThe same goes for the r/AcademicBiblical, I'm 100% sure that if you made a survey, less than 10% of Bible readers worldwide care what the Alexandrian text-type of the NT is or how it compares with the  Byzantine text-type; and they can genuinely and legitimately claim that their interest and priorities are not taken into account in that sub; in a sense they are right, but judgements calls were made.\n\nTaking into account the enormous popularity of GT in the Classics departments and how little SLA research is a subject of conversation among teachers and students that usually gravitate around Greek, the conscious and deliberate decision was taken of a confrontational approach. I'm really sorry that you interpret the FAQ as an attack against any particular group of people, that is simply not what it says, it is states the facts as well as could be ascertained; if the facts happen to disprove any particular method then it is just so. It wasn't we that ran those experiments, it is perfectly normal in any serious academic endeavour to test hypothesis, since GT was a very prominent hypothesis even among modern languages it is normal that it would be tested, it was and those are the results.\n\nRegarding the \"us\" vs \"they\", I have no idea if there's an \"us\", but there definitively is a \"they\": there are people that teach using GT, those people have yet to offer any rationale or justification for doing so, they have yet to answer to the many studies that repeatedly show that it is ineffective. Nobody is saying that they are bad people, or incompetent or in anyway inferior to anybody else,  it just happens that their adopted method is in all likelihood very, very ineffective to achieve their stated goal.\n\nIn summary, the very two points that you raise can be raised in identical terms against all the subs that establish any coherent hierarchy of priorities, I really wish there was a way to address your reticence without compromising the criteria that were chosen for what's to be included in the FAQ.

We purposefully chose to link to freely accessible material or material with free preview that summarizes the state of affairs and quotes from reputable peer reviewed articles and/or books (sometimes the only resources we found that fit that description happen to be blogs). Turns out that many of our visitors are relatively young and do not always have access to articles or books (or the time or interest to read the full papers/books) so we looked for the most layman friendly material. If you find something that's factually wrong and have the proof of it, please let us know so that we may make the necessary adjustments. This is a public forum, we're happy to be corrected but we need the proof of any mistake or misrepresentation.\n\n>The goal of which is frankly not fluency for most students, but to read and deeply comprehend certain specific texts.\n\nSLA research has shown that in order to gain the ability to read and deeply comprehend any text, the most effective way is to reach spoken fluency. I find it baffling that even in this day and age people claim to be able to read a language (any language) without being fluent in it, either you're fluent or you're decoding (nothing against decoding). Our good friends at r/Latin are years a head of us and have discussed this many times with thoroughness, [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/latin/comments/uchh07/scientific_papers_on_the_effectiveness_and/) for instance.\n\n>don't say anything at all about ancient greek.\n\nIt turns out that many GT teachers are unwilling to conduct experiments so the studies available are primarily concerned with modern languages. But since one of the fundamental claims of SLA theory is that all languages (even if they are learned with different objectives in mind, aka reading vs speaking) are acquired by the brain the exact same way, then there's no reason not to extrapolate the results we have available to Greek or Latin.\n\n>Mastronarde\n\nThere's a rumour going around that a professor said about him something along the lines of \"Oh, yeah, he's a genius and he's written a book by which a genius might learn Greek\". No idea if it's true or not, but I find it accurate. There's also the urban legend that Borges learned German by memorizing a dictionary, I'm ready to believe that he did, but that does not mean that I'll encourage people to follow his steps. If somebody can memorize abstract grammar rules and begin reading Greek good for him, the vast majority of prospective students are normal human beings and we recommend to follow a standard, scientifically proven method to teach them Greek (or any other language).\n\n>So this argument against this methodology seems strangely out of touch with ancient greek pedagogy\n\nIf the SLA theory is correct, then it is Ancient Greek Pedagogy (as commonly practised in most institutions) that's out of touch with reality.\n\n>This sidebar really unfairly represent the case for grammar translation\n\nAll right, I'll quote, again, the standard reference works on the matter:\n\n>\\[...\\] Grammar  Translation \\[...\\] is a method for which there is no literature that  offers a rational or justification for it or that attempts to relate it  to issues in linguistics, psychology, or educational theory.

Unless you mean to portrait a school that explicitly and systematically tried to teach mere grammar terminology and avoided at all costs that the students actually learned Latin even by accident.  Only then would time be wasted by spending time on oral exercises. In any other case, no matter how counter-intuitive it may seem, the students gain the real life equivalent of a videogame upgrade that allows them to pass through even the most difficult curriculum with the same easiness as an average guy who learns French by immersion is able to pass a French test better than somebody that has only memorized French grammar and parsed a few (or many) French texts.\n\n>perhaps get more out of the grammar-translation method because it covers far more than ground than would be covered using the natural-method.\n\nI can only speak from my personal anecdotal experience and that of my former classmates, now themselves teachers or professors. But it's the exact same thing as in the bicycle example. Somebody that has not been in a really immersive institution will definitively get the felling the first year that we've lost time or have fallen behind, but by the second year the students taught by any CI-based method or technique will be able to read faster and more accurately than the average grammar-translation pupil, ultimately not only we have been able to cover the curriculum faster but we've even had time to discuss explicit grammar in Latin and to begin reading out of mere pleasure.\n\n>as I pointed out elsewhere, reading is not handled cognitively the same way as spoken language,\n\nI have no idea what exactly do you mean by that (or what your sources are), but if you had taken time to read the previous discussions you would have found:\n\n>Randall Buth (look at [his conference from 0:00 to 15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWOjBulEyrs)), [here](https://www.biblicallanguagecenter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Role-Greek-Pronunciation-Buth-Handout-2019-SEBTS.pdf) is the handout from where he quotes.

Moreover, all human beings gain input primarily and overwhelmingly via oral expression as all languages are primarily oral communicative tools. All human brains are designed to learn using this approach, you can of course seek to improve the process but taking away the most vital aspect of with will not help.\n\nThe evidence is indisputable on this in all languages in which experiments have been conducted. You would really need to give a reason to even consider going the trouble of ruining a specific experiment again (as I said, none of the ones you mentioned are convincing). Think it this way: We know that botulinum toxin is incredibly deadly, we know the science behind it, we are 100% sure that any living organism that for any reason needs neurotransmitter acetylcholine will die if it comes into contact with it. Here comes somebody and says hey: there's this particular human that for institutional reasons has a different background, yes he stills need the acetylcholine, but we really need to be sure and run another experiment, maybe his particular bureaucratic context or his personal interests provoke a different reaction.\n\n>there are many more contingencies that favor a reading-only approach to learning dead languages over a more rounded oral and reading approach.\n\nNot a single on of those you mentioned I found convincing. A person less naive than  me might call them excuses instead of reasons.\n\nI would find more reasonable if some grammar-translation advocate were to be honest and simply say: \"I can't speak Latin, I don't know how to do it, I feel insecure, I don't want to embarrass myself, I'm afraid I'll lose my job if a change is implemented, I don't want to lose the respect of my students; my dean does not allow me to change\" or some other real reason.\n\nI would completely understand that somebody has to look after himself or his own self-esteem, but they need to be honest about it, to themselves at least.\n\nu/lingworec is an specialist of SLA and has tried many times to actually conduct those experiments you want and he has been flatly refused by GT teachers (from three USA universities, last time I spoke to him), I suspect for some or all of the reasons I mentioned above.\n\nI completely understand the difficulties of reforming a system (great success is happening in many places such a [Oxford](https://medium.com/in-medias-res/greek-and-latin-are-finding-a-voice-at-oxford-8c96adfaed87), Princeton and [Western Washington](https://www.theodysseyonline.com/princeton-living-latin-wwu-latin)), my personal position is: If someone really thinks GT is the way, let history decide.

If we were to add the number of students that have graduated from programs like the one in Kentucky or the many private schools like Paideia or Schola Latina or Polis (plus the many people that learned from the late Reggie Foster), the number should at least be triple and that's not taking into account the people that have learned in from professors in Universities like Stroh or von Albrecht or the self-learners like Rainieri.

First I recommend to take a look at [Koutropoulos](https://www.okcir.com/product/journal-article-modernizing-classical-language-education-communicative-language-teaching-educational-technology-integration-in-classical-greek-by-apostolos-koutropoulos/) and the many discussions we've had in the past ([here](https://www.reddit.com/r/latin/comments/gvqjfh/grammartranslation_vs_reading_method_which_is_the/), [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/latin/comments/8rp222/is_the_wheelock_latin_textbook_good_for_beginners/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/latin/comments/gca8mq/has_any_of_you_completed_both_lingua_latina_and/), for instance).\n\nFirst let us break it down by parts: We all agree that the end goal is to read Vergil and Cicero and Tacitus, nobody questions this, nobody has a different end-goal, but there are very different proposals as to how we reach that same goal. How can we get there effectively?\n\n1. All existent evidence made in multiple experiments in many languages have shown that the grammar-translation approach simply does not work (see the references quoted in the many discussions above). So, unless you want to argue that the human brain somehow process those two languages differently than it would any other language, no matter how obscure and rare, the conclusion is that we simply cannot keep teaching neither Greek nor Latin nor any other language with grammar translation. (Yes, there's relatively few of those experiments that have been done specifically in Latin or Greek, mainly because the teachers themselves refuse to be evaluated or for their students to be evaluated that way; but even then, there's no reason we could not extrapolate the results of the experiments done on German, Russian, English or Spanish to Latin and Greek).\n2. Second, we want our students to become fluent readers. How have students of all languages across time become fluent readers? The answer is: By first learning to hear and speak, aka: By first becoming fluent speakers. [Buth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWOjBulEyrs) makes an excellent summary of the state of the art (the papers that he quotes are linked in the discussions I mentioned above). So, yes: Even if it seems counter-intuitive to you (and according to Koutropoulos it only seems counter-intuitive to you because you were taught that the opposite was true) if you spend a lot of time getting your students to speak and hear and understand Latin on the spot (no parsing, no grammar analysis, no syntax trees, and no dictionary) that skill is precisely what will allow them to read fluently Vergil and Tacitus. Let's put it another way: How might you catch more fish: By jumping in the water with your bare hands and see what you can get hold of? Or by spending some time to make a fishing net? How might you best move a bunch of rocks, by pushing them or by building a CAT?\n\n[Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMKcBl2e-os&list=PLfku8EBM-vSJngxGnxpiFS1t4eKPwoFG1&index=51&t=29s), [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ku2ApYHb4Ac&list=PLfku8EBM-vSJngxGnxpiFS1t4eKPwoFG1&index=79), [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp0fZ4LrU_c&list=PLfku8EBM-vSJngxGnxpiFS1t4eKPwoFG1&index=133) and [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhy77Mng_NY&list=PLfku8EBM-vSJngxGnxpiFS1t4eKPwoFG1&index=148) are examples of some classes that show how a student and a teacher (that have dedicated time to first getting spoken fluency) approach Latin texts.\n\nTL:DR: You first become a fluent speaker so that you can then read fluently (faster and more effectively).", "created_utc": "1649441278.0", "edited": "1649441873.0", "id": "i3xji5p", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_tyc0jg", "parent_id": "t1_i3w8qg5", "score": "3", "subreddit": "latin", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qloa"}, {"author": "Indeclinable", "body": "Take a look at the FAQ in r/AncientGreek and r/Latin", "created_utc": "1649072715.0", "edited": "False", "id": "i3ca6bb", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_tvzsvo", "parent_id": "t3_tvzsvo", "score": "9", "subreddit": "classics", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qk88"}, {"author": "Indeclinable", "body": "Yes, you can get it in Librer\u00eda Aurea https://libreriaaurea.com/es/16146-via-latina.html\n\nIt\u2019ll reach Amazon in the next few weeks.", "created_utc": "1649031741.0", "edited": "False", "id": "i3ah34b", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_tvj8qz", "parent_id": "t1_i3abhta", "score": "8", "subreddit": "latin", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qloa"}, {"author": "Indeclinable", "body": ">Not that I've seen...\n\nIt's perfectly fine to disagree, but it would be better to state why you do so.\n\n>Pronunciation of Latin does tend to vary a bit depending on the country where it's being taught, but not to the degree you seem to imply.\n\nThere are well attested [regional pronunciations of Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_regional_pronunciation) (most of them still used, notably outside the Classics departments).

Reading hundreds of lines of poetry a day seems like someone who is fairly fluent to me..\n\nYou would need to define what you mean by \"read\". I do not speak a word of Russian, but if you give a dictionary a grammar and a translation I can by brute force decipher War and Peace, like several pages in relatively short time. But at the end of the day I still would not speak a word of Russian, perhaps if I keep up many years (or decades) I would eventually reach a level skill that could in all honesty be called fluency. But it's incredibly ineffective, boring, arid, tedious and unsustainable as a generalized practice.\n\nA good rule of thumb to measure fluency with little resources is what professor Buth mentions in his [conference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWOjBulEyrs): If you're a fluent English speaker and you, by chance, see for less than a second a sign-post or a writing of any kind, you cannot not read it: your brain automatically identifies the message written and forms an image in your head without you being able to stop it or interfere with it. That's fluency. The moment someone randomly sees a few lines of Caesar and without any thinking or concentration he automatically gets the message. The weird thing is, it is something that's relatively easy to achieve, all human beings are designed to communicate fluently and to learn languages, you just need to use an appropriate method and be disciplined about it.\n\n>So I'm not surprised that people comment their ma/phd didn't really improve their Latin or whatever since it's up to the individual if they want to improve.\n\nI can assure you that both Rico and Beard were excellent and dedicated students and did their very best to improve their language skills for many years but they hit the wall that are the objective, scientifically demonstrated limits of grammar-translation.

Christophe Rico [openly admits that all his education (BA, MA, PhD) was essentially useless in getting him to learn Greek (see 17:02 of the conference)](https://youtu.be/1n4LLBG2hgs?t=1022). You don't really need to dig very deep in most classics departments to verify the very sad state of affairs in which they find themselves.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>most of academia for the last 200 years has learned with this method \\[...\\] this has pretty much always been the method of learning the ropes.\n\nThis is demonstrably false. You can look at [Musumeci](https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/007138836) or [Kelly](https://archive.org/details/25centuriesoflan00kell) for instance. The best summary of the historical development of Latin teaching is Miraglia ([in Spanish](https://www.culturaclasica.com/lingualatina/03_La_ensenanza_del_latin_a_lo_largo_de_los_siglos.pdf), the original Italian is found in the [Latine doceo](https://www.worldcat.org/title/nova-via-latine-doceo-guida-per-glinsegnanti/oclc/912499585)). Books worth consulting are [Communicative Approaches for Ancient Languages](https://www.bloomsbury.com/uk/communicative-approaches-for-ancient-languages-9781350157354/) and [A Strange Odyssey: Confessions of a Classicist](https://classicsathome.com/odyssey/). Good articles to consult are [this](https://www.okcir.com/product/journal-article-modernizing-classical-language-education-communicative-language-teaching-educational-technology-integration-in-classical-greek-by-apostolos-koutropoulos/?doing_wp_cron=1646933931.9537959098815917968750) and [this](https://muse.jhu.edu/article/755533). A very good debate about the causes of the decline of Latin teaching is to be found in YouTube: [Miraglia](https://youtu.be/a61Dc_EFuI4) vs [Van Bommel](https://youtu.be/hFWpo905yAU). Again, you can find all the detailed references and quotations of why Wheelock (and the whole grammar-translation \"method\") does not work in the discussions I quoted above.\n\n>But based on my students abilities after 6 months with Wheelock I can say they are further along than I was at this point.\n\nI cannot judge you or your students without having some objective measurable standards. But you can look at little kids that learn Latin effectively ([here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6pER6empz8)) and decide for yourself what are your criteria for measurement.", "created_utc": "1646935428.0", "edited": "1646938025.0", "id": "i04uxsa", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_taxm6z", "parent_id": "t1_i04nayz", "score": "7", "subreddit": "latin", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qloa"}, {"author": "Indeclinable", "body": "OP.

For the coining of new words there have been some discussions in the past ([here](https://www.reddit.com/r/latin/comments/md7z6v/how_do_modern_users_of_latin_deal_with_loan_words/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/latin/comments/q0uvux/latin_and_our_nonbinary_friends/), for example).\n\nThere's no single individual or institution that decides what words to include or not. There's not even a general consensus on who a credible authority should be or whose opinion should be taken into account and on what grounds.\n\nI exaggerate a little but there's basically two tendencies (and a lot of in between): 1) Those who try to make as few changes as possible to Latin as a language, prefer to look for months or years to see of there's a precedent or an analogy that could fit before resorting to neologisms, try their best to preserve Latin with as little changes as possible and would rather not change it at all if it can be helped; this does not mean that they won't come up with a way to say \"computer\" or \"internet\", it just means that they will take longer to decide and their proposal might not be transparent to those who speak a modern language. \\[I ascribe to this group\\]. 2) Those who don't mind latinizing English (or French, or German or Spanish) words just to get across a subject and are willing to even go against basic presuppositions and patterns that have been a constant in Latin the last 2,000 years as long as they can get to express their ideas in \"Latin\" \\[often, but not always they end up basically making up a new romance language that would be hardly understood by any Latin speaker, be it from Rome, the Renaissance or today's Latin speaking community\\].\n\nTo put a minor anecdotal example: People from the second group proposed the term \"pellicula\" for films or videos. People from the first group prefer a term such a \"taenia\".\n\nRegarding the debate about Latin pronunciation see [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/latin/comments/sykz28/whats_with_the_dislike_of_the_calabrese_vowel/).", "created_utc": "1645581648.0", "edited": "1645582316.0", "id": "hy1oo23", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_sz31k4", "parent_id": "t3_sz31k4", "score": "1", "subreddit": "latin", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qloa"}, {"author": "Indeclinable", "body": "Dear user, there is a misunderstanding implied in your question.\n\nIn order to translate from any language into another you must first know the language that you want to translate: You cannot translate from Chinese if you don't know Chinese, you cannot translate from Latin if you don't know Latin.\n\nThe next question to be asked is how you can effectively learn Latin. For that you can see the FAQ on sidebar. Once you can read and understand Latin spontaneously then the translation comes in easily to your mind.\n\nAnother possibility is to rephrase your question as follows: If you're not interested in learning Latin (aka, you do not want to eventually be able to read Latin fluently the same way you read English, or you don't mind waiting decades of gruelling, boring, inefficient grammar-analysis to reach a level of fluency that you could archive faster and more effectively by the means described in the FAQ), and you only want to learn some paradigms and parsing techniques that are requested by your school/teacher in order to pass a class, almost any random book is as good as the others.

I'm very happy to hear your thoughts:\n\nIn principle, I'm also sceptical of this \"Answer Key culture\" that seems to be a thing in most anglophone countries and on the internet. The first reason is what you mention, we're giving away answers to potential students. Second, I have never understood the need for an answer key in any classroom setting, the student has his teacher to correct him and any teacher that's worth his salt should at the bare minimum be able to answer the questions of a beginner's book.  \n\nThere are however, three circumstances that have made me reconsider: 1) Many of our redditors are self learners and have no access to a teacher, in the past I've taken the position that, even then, they should be able to slowly work their way through either of those books and ask for feedback here or on the Latin discord. Even though I've seen a number of successful examples that have followed this path, the vast majority is either too embarrassed to ask for feedback or is blocked out of some (to me) unexplainable psychological fear of simply not having an answer key. I have no idea why this happens, in my home country none of the books used in the public education system from kindergarten to college has an answer key. In any case the problem is there. \n\n2) Neither the Italian Athenaze nor Zuntz is widely used in schools or colleges, and the teachers that use them never (or rarely) grade the exercises books, basically all grades go to class participation and exams. In the exchanges I've had with most teachers and professors that are reluctant to adopt either book, the lack of an answer key is a prominent factor.\n\n3) I've not ceased to be surprised at the serious lack of basic proficiency among some of my colleagues, I certainly hope it's not a generalized problem worldwide, but I've encountered many Greek teachers these past few years (some of them with a PhD and some of them teaching at university level) that had significant problems in answering correctly (any book) without an answer key. I don't want to pass judgement on them, but if I were a student of them I would certainly prefer to have an answer key at hand.\n\nA fourth reason (and a personal one): I simply want to do away as quickly as possible with the old grammar-translation books, for that I need the better books to gain in popularity, if I need to give away an answer key (for free), I'm convinced that in the long run all students, even the lazy ones that will simply copy the answers, will learn more from using Athenaze or Zuntz than any alternative, and even in a worst case scenario, those will be the books they will know and recommend.\n\nWhat do you think?", "created_utc": "1643118101.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hu5gfbu", "is_submitter": "True", "link_id": "t3_sc17a9", "parent_id": "t1_hu4so8z", "score": "5", "subreddit": "AncientGreek", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qwux"}, {"author": "Indeclinable", "body": "If you take a very detailed look at the [guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PB5HPz2wBDgqWXPnn5ONgZicOPv8P7LbODvkCxjpI3w/edit) in the FAQ you will find all the info you need.

He would always pull out an example of an inscription or an MSS reading in which the same or an analogous mistake was made to demonstrate that it was normal and that that was the reason why we might encounter such phenomena doing \"real philology\". These situations occurred mostly in the \"open conversation\" sections in which we would try (and fail) to improvise a conversation without preparation, on dictations, or on oral examinations of past or mixed subjects where we did not know before hand if we were being asked to use a specific tense or a specific word. But with time and a lot of practice we managed to get a very good grasp of it, we had out own gesticulation, for instance we would use the \"yes\" sign (move your extended finger up and down) to signal a subscribed iota, a hand wave frontwards to indicate subjunctive or a hand wave upwards to indicate optative and emphasizing the conjunction (if there was one) while doing the gesticulation.\n\nIn retrospect I believe the old man made the right choice, I can think of a number of languages, Japanese for instance, where the number of identical homophones is mindblowing, without context it is impossible to know what \"shi\" or \"go\" mean unless you look at the character, and yet the Japanese get by very well.

You would never accuse a NASA scientist of being in a heliocentric cult if he provides evidence that backs up his claims. So please refrain to use ad hominem arguments in here. We would all be very happy to learn from you if you can provide some quotable evidence to support your claims, the same way the guys at r/latin provide scientific research that supports their claims. Here and there all debates and rebuttals are welcome and appreciated provided there's scientific evidence to prove or disprove a claim.\n\nSecond, while it is true that there are some differences between the way an adult and a child learns, the matter is still very much on debate.\n\n>There is considerable debate over the explanation for these age-related effects with much of it focusing on the question of whether there is a critical or sensitive period for second language acquisition, as there is for first language acquisition, after which time access to innate language learning capacities is unavailable (for reviews and positions, see Birdsong 2004, 2005; DeKeyser 2000; DeKeyser & Larson-Hall 2005; Hyltenstam & Abrahamsson 2003; Ioup 2005; Marinova-Todd, Marshall, & Snow 2000). Views supporting a critical period hypothesis (and some views of an innate language acquisition device, to be discussed below) suggest that child SLA is qualitatively different from adult SLA, although age limits are somewhat fluid and variable across different areas of language (age 7 is sometimes identified as a cut-off in phonology, whereas puberty has often been proposed as a cut-off in other domains, such as morphosyntax). Alternatively, the competition model (e.g., Bates & MacWhinney 1989; MacWhinney 2005) suggests that L1 and L2 acquisition processes are inherently similar, yet differ according to the learners\u2019 experience with another language. Both of these views, of course, leave room for differences between child and adult SLA. ([PHILP, OLIVER & MACKEY p. 9](https://benjamins.com/catalog/lllt.23))\n\nBut\n\n>There is ample evidence that the human brain is experience *expectant*, biologically programmed to seek the necessary linguistic input (Bruer 1999) to learn a first language. \\[...\\]  For subsequent languages, the human brain is experience *dependent*, biologically capable of learning another language, but not necessarily destined to do so. The L2 will, like the L1, show concomitant deficits if sufficient input is not received within an appropriate time frame. \\[...\\] The range of evidence presented in this chapter indicates that childhood is indeed a more sensitive period for acquiring a post-maternal language, but the period is not a critical one; it does not have a categorical terminus and its dimensions vary individually due to a number of additional external and internal factors. ([HERSCHENSOHN & YOUNG-SCHOLTEN p. 337](https://www.cambridge.org/us/academic/subjects/languages-linguistics/applied-linguistics-and-second-language-acquisition/cambridge-handbook-second-language-acquisition?format=HB&isbn=9781107007710))\n\nGoing back to the nuance point you make. Neither LLPSI nor Athenaze, nor JACT not even Polis, renounces explicit grammar entirely, they just relegate it to a less important position in the learning process. Nobody, not in here nor in r/Latin is advocating a grammarless instruction. All scientific evidence suggests that the decisive factor in the learning process is comprehensible input, and it has been proved beyond doubt in countless experiments that people can learn a language even if they are not 24/7 immersed and even if they are not surrounded by natives. (Of course the amount of time required, the quantity and quality of CI required and even the results of the many different combinations leave much room for debate).\n\nNone if this however can even remotely suggest that the grammar-translation method as practised by 98% of Greek and Latin teachers is NOT fundamentally flawed and ineffective if the objective is to get the student to acquire quickly any measure of fluency (be it written or spoken) in the target language. This has been discussed abundantly in r/Latin [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/latin/comments/gvqjfh/grammartranslation_vs_reading_method_which_is_the/), [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/latin/comments/8rp222/is_the_wheelock_latin_textbook_good_for_beginners/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/latin/comments/gca8mq/has_any_of_you_completed_both_lingua_latina_and/).\n\nWe can of course debate the order or presentation of grammatical concepts in any given book, the quality of the CI present, they excess or lack of explicit explanations, the need or lack of need of those explanations depending on age, education, context, etc.\n\nAlso, I happen to be a mod of r/Latin, if I missed any user that is advancing dubious claims without providing evidence, please point it out to me so that I can take the proper measures.", "created_utc": "1640357690.0", "edited": "1640616298.0", "id": "hpta8yj", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_rna4fn", "parent_id": "t1_hpt0kwe", "score": "5", "subreddit": "AncientGreek", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qwux"}, {"author": "Indeclinable", "body": "You are aware that the whole nomenclature (\"first aorist\" vs \"second aorist\") is just as arbitrary as any alternative, right?

I find it completely untenable that people try to come up with excuses not to do precisely that. I cannot for the life of me think of anyone telling an expert on Cervantes that his department is doing it wrong and that his students should \"learn\" in a way that makes them unable to speak and read Spanish fluently. Why would you want to translate Cervantes when you can read it in the original? Why would you translate Virgil if you can just read it?\n\n>you don't need to speak Greek or Latin anyway.\n\nDefine \"need\". Modern linguistics actually has proven that you do need to speak a language in order to actually learn the language effectively.

Then, no. The article speaks about a phenomenon that runs parallel (and at times overlaps) with what you've described. You see, until the late 18th Century, the \"method\" used to teach both Greek and Latin in all Europe and the Americas was essentially the same that was used for any other language: the main focus was to teach the children the ability to speak and converse fluently in the target language, only after that was the emphasis changed to drills, reading and composition exercises. \n\nIn the late 18th and early 19th Centuries a combination of multiple factors (Enlightenment ideas about the supposed rationality of languages, the advent of nationalisms that priced the mother national tongue over any Paneuropean tongue like Latin or Greek, Romantic ideas about the purity of the \"Volk\" or the people and the inner strength of the sincere spirit of the \"Volk\" traditions and songs over the \"artificial\" and \"imitative\" traditional poets like Virgil and Horace, and the death of Latin as a common everyday tongue, etc.) led to the disappearance of that method. The result was the \"Grammar-Translation\" method that most people know as the \"Traditional method\" to learning classical languages. In a nutshell: memorization of paradigms, grammar analysis of sentences, translation of Latin into English, etc. \n\nThe Grammar-Translation method has been disproved beyond doubt by linguists but it remains the most common approach used by Greek and Latin teachers (Specially in the German and the Anglophone countries). Since the early 90's various groups of Latin teachers and researches have coalesced around the idea of returning to the true traditional method (one that happens to be validated by the research of linguists and the whole discipline of Second Language Acquisition) of putting the focus of learning to speak fluently, learning by steps and Comprehensible Input, and relegating the grammar drills until the very end (and banishing translation). In a nutshell: the idea is to teach Latin or Greek the exact same way people teach French or Italian or German. That's what's meant in \"finding a voice\" in the article, of course, here it should also be \"reclaiming a voice\" as you rightly said.\n\nMore info about this can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/latin/comments/gvqjfh/grammartranslation_vs_reading_method_which_is_the/), [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/latin/comments/8rp222/is_the_wheelock_latin_textbook_good_for_beginners/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/latin/comments/gca8mq/has_any_of_you_completed_both_lingua_latina_and/).

So unless you go to a place with a really good program/teachers, most Classics departments are really not worth the money you'll be investing. But if you're rich you can experiment and not risk going into eternal debt/bankruptcy. If you live in a civilized country where education is financed by the collective, then make use of the services that your taxes helped to finance.\n\nSecond, take into account that the University as a whole is in a crisis (at least in the anglophone countries), polemical but good books to read are [Who Killed Homer?](https://www.amazon.com/Who-Killed-Homer-Classical-Education/dp/1893554260/) and [The Coddling of the American Mind](https://www.amazon.com/Coddling-American-Mind-Intentions-Generation/dp/0735224897). (I say this because there's the strong possibility that you could end up in a course about some fancy literary theory where you \"deconstruct\" the classics or even outright reject them, I know of a guy that got his BA in Classics without ever reading Homer or Virgil, even in translation; this will of course, depend on where you go and who teaches there).\n\nIf we speak about how good are the language teaching methods in most Classics departments, the picture is even worse. Private schools like the [Paideia Institute](https://www.paideiainstitute.org), [Polis](https://www.polisjerusalem.org/), [Vivarium Novum](https://vivariumnovum.net/), [Schola Latina](https://scholalatina.it/), [Classics at Home](https://classicsathome.com/), [Grecolatinovivo](https://www.grecolatinovivo.it/), [Schola Nova](https://www.scholanova.be/index.php/en), [Schola Humanistica](https://www.scholahumanistica.com/),  [Collegium Latinitatis](https://collegiumlatinitatis.com/), [Schola Classica](https://www.scholaclassica.com/), [Studium Angelopolitanum](https://studiumangelopolitanum.wordpress.com/), [Am\u00e1rantos](https://www.facebook.com/circulus.mexicopolitanus), [La Academia](https://sites.google.com/site/latinvivoenmadrid/la-academia), [GraecoLatinum](https://www.facebook.com/GraecoLatinumCursos), [Schola Sorbonae](https://www.facebook.com/ScholaSorbonae/), [Societas Sanctus Hieronymus](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100007379476768), [Schola Latina II](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrilvywYbcc) are infinitely much cheaper and much more effective than an average language course in an average classics department.\n\nThe big advantages of going to University are things like access to libraries, socialization with like minded people with whom you can study and debate; and the wisdom and guidance that only a true professor-scholar can provide if you aim to dedicate your life to this wonderful field, even as a hobby. All of this, whoever, depends on choosing a good program with good teachers.\n\nMy suggestion would be: Study Greek and Latin for two years (or until you get reading fluency), read some general books, like the ones recommended [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/classics/comments/h93yt1/comment/fuvbab2/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3); then pick one author that interest you and try to read it in the original (don't be afraid to turn to a translation at the beginning), if necessary read an introduction/commentary of that author. If at the end you feel that you understood what it was all about, then you can probably go solo about it, or at the very least you'll have some very good foundations with which to go back into the Uni. If you feel completely lost and disoriented then the structured approach of a Classics program might be what you need.\n\nPd. If you speak German, there are books dedicated to teaching the basics of what every Classics program should cover ([Einf\u00fchrung in das Studium der Latinistik](https://www.chbeck.de/riemer-weissenberger-zimmermann-c-h-beck-studium-einfuehrung-studium-latinistik/product/17011628), [Einf\u00fchrung in das Studium der Gr\u00e4zistik](https://www.chbeck.de/riemer-weissenberger-zimmermann-einfuehrung-studium-graezistik/product/12247), [Einleitung in die griechische Philologie](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-663-12074-2), [Einleitung in die lateinische Philologie](https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/9783110962390/html); the closest thing in English is [Schaps](https://www.routledge.com/Handbook-for-Classical-Research/Schaps/p/book/9780415425230)).", "created_utc": "1633409695.0", "edited": "1633410280.0", "id": "hfg1uer", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_q1macr", "parent_id": "t3_q1macr", "score": "9", "subreddit": "latin", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qloa"}, {"author": "Indeclinable", "body": "I see no abusive language nor any ad hominem or any explicit attack on anyone.

I personally studied in one of those institutions that actively promote spoken Latin and let me tell you, the last thing in their minds is making Latin more inclusive, most of them are actually opposed at the idea of \"reviving the language\" (aka making it a normal everyday tongue with which I could order at a McDonalds) (I find very ironic that the best and most competent Latin speakers I've met happen to have serious issues with their sexuality, they just choose not to address it). Yes they promote the spoken aspect of it, but with with a very heavy and strict emphasis of preserving the language as attested, I remember having endless discussions about how to justify (based on texts or analogies) the way to call a USB-Stick or a pizza.\n\nAlso, do keep in mind that all the interest in addressing issues surrounding sexuality and sexual identity, is first and foremost an urban phenomenon and a very anglophone urban phenomenon, if you go out of your bubble of USA+Canada+Parts of Europe (and some very internationally-connected urban centres) you'll find nobody addressing these issues, so statistically you're not likely to find many people interested in Latin for starters and even less that are interested in Latin and issues of sexual identity. Outside a couple of friends from the USA I've met nobody who is seriously interested in Latin and whose identity is so important an issue for him/her/it to bother them to try to look for alternatives in Latin about it. Even they admit that their experiments make them incomprehensible to the rest of their speaking circle and just turn back to \"standard Latin\" in practice.\n\nI am aware of the existence of a couple of small communities in the USA that have their \"inclusive Latin\" but even they use it only among themselves (and they are such a minuscule minority that I'm not even sure that \"community\" is an appropriate word to describe them), I would be hard pressed to call what they do \"Latin\", if they continue to be isolated they'll just end up with their own conlang. Yes it will be inclusive and satisfying to their psychological/emotional needs, but it won't be Latin.\n\nIn sum, I believe that the answer of the modern Latin speaking community is: \"we don't care about the changes and conditions of modern society, we are only interested in reconstruction of a specific historical period's use of this language\" as u/qed1 said.", "created_utc": "1630074994.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hak7uk9", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_pcfd0q", "parent_id": "t1_haj5c1t", "score": "6", "subreddit": "latin", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qloa"}, {"author": "Indeclinable", "body": "Both, there are a lot of medieval or renaissance settings that are obviously  in the public domain, in those last two videos I linked (Honos alit artes) the teacher, Eusebius, makes ample reference to them.

You have no idea how much time is dedicated to pronunciation in most schools and colleges. Ironically, the people that often are the most picky about pronunciation are often the ones that can't speak Greek or Latin and refuse categorically and dogmatically to even attempt it or to incorporate it to their classroom activities. \n\nIt's the same sort of desire one finds among polyglots (see YouTube), they are all obsessed about sounding \"like a native\" or being \"indistinguishable from a native\", I never understood that. I'm a more practical guy, as long as I can get myself understood (English is not my native language by the way) I really don't care if I have an accent or if people can tell right away where I come from.

A summary:\n\n1) Easiness: Experience has shown that one can get a student to speak and read faster and more confidently if he can follow and imitate a clear and attested pattern (and get lots of easily available input). Just like I would teach modern English pronunciation to someone interested only in Shakespeare that wants to learn English, or modern Spanish to someone interested only in Cervantes. They can learn those respective restored pronunciations later on (Dillon's argument).\n\n2) Relevance: In most high-school or school settings (and even in most college settings) the vast majority of students will probably never deal with Ancient Greek again in their lives, it is more useful for them to learn the modern pronunciation so as to at least be able to pick up a few words of Modern Greek (it is far more likely that one day they might encounter a Greek or travel to Greece).\n\n3) Avoiding uncertainty: As shown in the articles, despite the efforts of Allen's fans and successors we're still very much unsure about the exact sound of Greek as actually spoken in a fluent manner (and at times even the individual sound of letters is contested). Even if we were to ignore those doubts, most Ancient Greek teachers never bother to speak (if they can) and if they do, they butcher their pronunciation with their native accents; they don't respect vocal length, accents or rhythm and have no natural cadence. So the whole \"respect the meter and euphony\" falls apart in practice. (I myself don't care at all about meter or euphony, even less if in practice is more of a cacophony, see Rainieri's videos for examples of these \"practices\"; modern pronunciation ends up sounding better).\n\n\\*This for me is the strongest reason, dad always said that I learned like a monkey: only by imitation. So unless someone can provide me with a recording of Homer himself that I can hear and imitate, no matter the effort or time spent I will only produce drunken banshee screams, so I don't even bother.\n\n4. Respect of tradition: People have an Italian pronunciation of Latin or a German pronunciation of Latin, or even a Spanish one and use that one to speak it. Wyoming English or Indian English are still valid and legitimate forms of English. I see no reason to impose a model (based often in educated guesses and in practice not respected by their own advocates) when we have an oven-ready solution that is historically attested.\n\n5. Which Ancient Greek pronunciation? Do we use attic reconstruction for Homer or Pindar? Why don't we try a Beocian pronunciation for Plutarch? Or a Doric/Spartan one for Tyrtaeus? If respecting the original euphony and cadence is our main priority, surely we must strive to have an accurate Ionian pronunciation for Herodotus. What about tragedy? It is an endless unsolvable puzzle that inevitably leads to contradictions and it's a waste of precious time, instead we could just ignore (at least temporarily) these questions and use a pronunciation that has been in use since at least the 5th century CE.", "created_utc": "1629932972.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hacsyi4", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_pakg2c", "parent_id": "t1_haclj75", "score": "7", "subreddit": "AncientGreek", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qwux"}, {"author": "Indeclinable", "body": "In the resources are only explained the reasons why one might chose one or many pronunciations, which was the question.

All languages, whether dead or alive are primarily and essentially a spoken phenomenon with communicative purposes. Yes, the *goals* are different, but the essential nature of a language and the way that humans learn it does not change. See [Burth's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWOjBulEyrs) for more info on this.\n\nThere are people (and institutions) trying to revive [extinct languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extinct_language) (or save [endangered languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lists_of_endangered_languages)) based on writings (not on Native speakers) and teaching them using CI. How is Latin or Greek any different from [Livonian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livonian_language) or [Yurok](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yurok_language)?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Everyone I\u2019ve known who has attained a solid level of competence in Ancient Greek, and Latin, too, has mastered the grammar in the traditional way and then gone on to solidify their grasp by reading.\n\nNot only is this anecdotal evidence, it can actually be explained by the Comprehensible Input theory. Basically what those people did was to force feed themselves grammar until the message (texts) became comprehensible, if you repeat this for many years, eventually you might get a level of reading fluency (in the end is the Comprehensible Input that got the job done). Or you might never get it like [Rico](https://youtu.be/1n4LLBG2hgs?t=1022) or [Beard](http://blogicarian.blogspot.com/2019/03/argumentum-ad-ignorantiam.html). OP, ask around in any Classics department and you'll meet people (even professors like Beard) that will confess that despite decades of learning and teaching the language they are incapable of reading a random paragraph fluently and accurately the same way that a below-average student of French can read the a French newspaper in a year or even less. With the exception of the Classics departments that cling to that old method like a dogma, everyone else (French department, Spanish department, Linguistics department) has long moved on to methods that are actually effective (and can prove their effectiveness in replicable experiments).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Those who don\u2019t learn the grammar flounder.\n\nAgain this is a fallacy. Nobody is advocating a grammar-less course. Nobody is trying to suggest that you should ignore the grammar. The evidence simply shows that the best way to internalize the grammar is by graded, beginner friendly Comprehensible Input. A simple look at the books recommended like Athenaze or Polis (see the resources page) will dispel this accusation, they are full of grammar, they simply advocate a different way to internalize it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>I wonder how far the advocates of ignoring the grammar have gone in reading.\n\nLike I said, nobody is advocating ignoring grammar. And those people have gotten very far indeed, they do almost nothing but read texts. Here's an example of a [class on Thucydides](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rq_cTWsiKs) or [another one on Herodotus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2q6aSCRpvs) or another one [on Homer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy3270CAi54) or another [one about Dionysius of Halicarnassus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZun7KCC2l0&list=PLbtTxDpCIJ5JsEWH6G6Jz8tOHcfZvHjQ7&index=16), or one about [Greek Dialects](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0buxKVgJz84), there are even classes on how to teach Greek like [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xY1uc5XKTb8) or [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a3ZbJJBDr4).

Ep. 10.96](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Plin.+Ep.+10.96&fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0139), translation [here](https://faculty.georgetown.edu/jod/texts/pliny.html)).\n\nDo note that there are good reasons to believe that this whole episode is false or an interpolation (see [this](https://brill.com/view/journals/vc/68/3/article-p264_2.xml?language=en) and [this](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-roman-studies/article/myth-of-the-neronian-persecution/73AC9F872D273C643F4E910B87B1A234)). You can borrow Koestermann's [commentary](https://archive.org/details/corneliustacitus0004koes) on Archive (pages 253-4) where he cites all the scholarly bibliography relevant to this passage. A more student friendly commentary is [Miller's](https://www.bloomsbury.com/uk/tacitus-annals-xv-9781853994340/) or [Owen & Hildenhard's](https://www.openbookpublishers.com/product/215/).\n\nAlso, while there may have been circumstantial evidence to suspect the jews (or the christians living among them) of having something to do with the fire (they lived very close to where the fire started and most of their houses were not burned), the fact that the passage is suspicious and the fact that (as mentioned in the articles) the information that Tacitus should have had on the christians based on what he most probably knew from Pliny (and viceversa) does not match, make this whole christian mention very problematic.\n\nMore importantly, there is now a consensus that Tacitus (or whomever wrote this passage) most probably did not write \"christians\" (christianos) but (chrestianos), probably in reference to the followers of an agitator named Chrestus (mentioned in [Suet. Cl. 25.4](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Suet.+Cl.+25.4&fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0061)), evidence of this is pretty strong (see [here](http://www.textexcavation.com/documents/zaratacituschrestianos.pdf)), however, as [Lichtenberger](https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/9783110813579-005/html) rightly argues, there is no doubt that the christians were meant and not the chrestians. The point is that there was probably not a very clear idea of what christians were so all the accusations against them are very likely the product of rumours, prejudice and confusion of them with other gruops like the jews, other small sects and agitators like the chrestians.\n\nSo, supposing this whole \"neronian persecution\" actually happened, it was based on falsehoods.", "created_utc": "1621186621.0", "edited": "1621187074.0", "id": "gycgzz0", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_ndpzw7", "parent_id": "t3_ndpzw7", "score": "2", "subreddit": "latin", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qloa"}, {"author": "Indeclinable", "body": "Hi!

Von Albrecht's [De Simia Heidelbergensi](https://www.amazon.de/Simia-Heidelbergensi-Michael-von-Albrecht/dp/392928023X) is a monument to scholarship and style, Cicero himself would approve (there's a [recording available of the prefaces](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lq3p3-8a0pc)); he also has edited an anthology of poetry written by him and his students in Heidelberg called [Scripta Latina](https://books.google.com/books/about/Scripta_Latina.html?id=NEh6wgEACAAJ&); I have heard good things about Stephen Berard's [Capti](https://www.amazon.com/CAPTI-Fabula-Menippeo-Hoffmanniana-Americana-Latin/dp/1456759744). Take a look at [Korenjak](https://www.chbeck.de/korenjak-geschichte-neulateinischen-literatur/product/16037995) and [Knight & Tilg](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-oxford-handbook-of-neo-latin-9780199948178?cc=mx&lang=en&), perhaps they are aware if things that I don't know. Good databases are to be found [here](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/arts/ren/snls/neolatintexts).\n\nDo keep in mind that von Albrecht is probably the most accomplished Latinist alive, I have heard Miraglia and the late Reggie Foster say that his Latin is the most elegant they've seen written by a modern scholar; so his standard is pretty high. Don't expect to find many people that can write at his level.\n\nThat said, the late [Francisco Jose\u0301 Cabrera](http://worldcat.org/identities/lccn-nb2009002180/) published a variety of poetry of very high quality. I personally recommend his Joann\u00e6 virginis laudes and Quahunahuac. A good anthology of his work is [this one](https://www.worldcat.org/title/homerico-poeta-francisco-jose-cabrera-sus-once-poemas-heroicos-en-latin-clasico/oclc/1121642665).\n\nI don't know if this counts but my former teacher once wrote a Star Wars poem called [De Bello Sidereo](https://medium.com/in-medias-res/de-bello-sidereo-200c66f6de6c). Another friend once wrote a [Latin version of the new Sappho fragment](http://ephemeris.alcuinus.net/poesis.php?id=4762). Until July 2017, Miraglia even had a [column in a newspaper in Latin](https://www.avvenire.it/Archivio/rubriche/mercurius/2019/7).\n\nThough [Pascoli](https://la.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ioannes_Pascoli) published most of his work before 1900, there are some poems or anthologies that were published after 1900, he is also one of the most renowned Neo-latin poets. I highly recommend his [Corda Fratres](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oZ5q_qAJt0) (which should be the European Union anthem).\n\nLastly, I know you don't want translations, but Paoli's [Pinoculus Latinus](https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/007347193) is just so beautifully translated that it deserves a mention. He also published the famous [Ciceronis filius](https://www.worldcat.org/title/ciceronis-filius/oclc/156740326).\n\nNutting's [Ad Alpes](https://archive.org/details/nuttingadalpes/mode/2up) was also published after 1900, as was his [Latin reader](https://archive.org/details/afirstlatinread02nuttgoog/page/n4/mode/2up), but those things fall into the category of \"Latin for learners\" that is very good, but they don't have aesthetic pretensions.

They even have a Latin fan club called [Academia Latinitati Fovendae](https://academialatinitatifovendae.com/sodales).\n\nAnd you have been given more than \"enthusiasts\", you have been quoted scientific evidence, papers, books that demonstrate that Grammar Translation does not work.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>IIRC, it'd be B2 ON PAPER, meaning most students will struggle to reach B1.

([Richards & Rodgers 2014: 7](https://books.google.com/books?id=HrhkAwAAQBAJ&lpg=PP1&dq=Approaches%20and%20Methods%20in%20Language%20Teaching&hl=es&pg=PA7#v=onepage&q&f=false))Very  few, if any of the elements hypothesized to contribute to the development of proficiency are present in the grammar-translation method. ... Grammar-translation methodology is not necessarily conducive to building toward proficiency and may, in fact, be quite   counterproductive. ([Omaggio Hadley 2001: 106-107](https://books.google.com.mx/books?id=OtnCQgAACAAJ&dq))It  is remarkable, in one sense, that this method has been so stalwart   among many competing models.  It does virtually nothing to enhance a student\u2019s communicative ability in the language. ... As we continue to examine theoretical principles in this book, I think we will understand more fully the \u2018theorylessness\u2019 of the Grammar Translation Method.  ([Brown 2007: 16-17](https://books.google.com.mx/books?id=jUF0QgAACAAJ&dq))\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Then it's kinda preposterous to claim that Pontano & co didn't know  what grammar structures were. Maybe they didn't use the \"labels\" we use  nowadays, but surely they could master *consecutio temporum* or dative of possession.\n\nMy point exactly, they didn't need, nobody needs to use modern labels and tables to master a language, it's comprehensible input. Yes in certain circumstances a table might be a good support for clarification or for the awareness of a process but the process itself is unconscious, like in all languages.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Because medieval Latin is kind of a bastardized language with plenty of  influxes from vulgar, with increasingly inconsistent grammar, simplified  syntax etc exactly becauase it was written by non-native speakers who  were trying their best.\n\nAgain, denigrating your object of study is not conductive to proving a point. Erasmus and Valla and Melanchton and Pascoli and Sepulveda and Vives and pretty much everyone born after the 6th Century is a non-native that's trying his best, that does not mean that one cannot reach a very high degree of fluency in a language, hell [Georges Pompidou](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georges_Pompidou) could talk to his minsters in Ancient Greek about agricultural policy.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Learning to translate dead languages is \"a waste of time\" to many, how  is learning to SPEAK them (or their approximation) an improvement?\n\nLearning to speak a language is not only a logical requisite to translating, but it also seems to me a more defensible goal than translating. If you go to any school that proposes living Latin or Greek (Kentucky, Polis, Vivarium Novum, Schola Latina, Schola Humanistica, etc), you'll see that the matriculation never ceases to grow.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>the goal is NOT to teach students how to converse in Greek or Latin, but  to give them the tools to do something with existing texts.\n\nAgree, it's not the end goal but its the tool required so that they can do something with the existing texts (in an attractive and fruitful manner, while having fun).", "created_utc": "1619454512.0", "edited": "1619455898.0", "id": "gvy24qt", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_my55ro", "parent_id": "t1_gvwpgx8", "score": "3", "subreddit": "latin", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qloa"}, {"author": "Indeclinable", "body": "RESPONSE PART 1.\n\nI hear what you're saying and I conclude that you're wrong.

The technical definition of a dead language is having no native speakers, but that in no way impedes or prohibits it being used (and taught and learned) to fluency levels by other people. Just think of all the millions of Asians and Latin Americans that learn English taught by non-native teachers and achieve very high degrees of proficiency. The whole purpose of Second Language Acquisition as a discipline was to explain why sometimes this fails or succeeds and the conclusion was that [Comprehensible Input is the deciding factor](https://www.sk.com.br/sk-krash.html).\n\nNo language is like maths, languages are languages and all of them should be treated like languages.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>I see the reasoning behind CI, it's just I don't see why it'd matter about dead languages!\n\nThat's because you have literally been trained not to see (see Koutropoulos' article).

A good history of how we got where we are is [Miraglia's](http://www.culturaclasica.com/lingualatina/03_La_ensenanza_del_latin_a_lo_largo_de_los_siglos.pdf).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>It's up to you, but would you trust people with academic creds or a  bunch of YouTube enthusiasts who are studying Greek and Latin as if it  were Klingon or Dothraki for kicks?\n\nFirst of all, I don't think that it's becoming of an MA in Classics to use appeal-to-authority fallacies to try to fool your interlocutor. Second, all the people that study Greek or Latin (or the humanities in general) do it for the kicks, I've never met a scholar worthy of his name that does not love his subject passionately, nobody is getting rich lecturing about Cicero. Third, it's also unbecoming of a serious academic to try and denigrate their colleagues and their work with personal disqualifications that do not engage with the argument at hand, specially if the accusation is false. The people that you refer to as \"YouTube enthusiasts\" (implying that a YouTube enthusiast could never compete with someone in a Classics department, as a matter of fact not only they can, they often win) are people like: [Michael von Albrecht](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_von_Albrecht) PhD ([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRFd5pfszT4)); [Terence Tunberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terence_Tunberg) PhD ([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VA4dW8h8ZGU&t=95s)) who teaches his [University lectures in Latin](https://mcl.as.uky.edu/latin-institute#latine) and [often publishes his research in Latin](https://lup.be/products/100285); [Wilfried Stroh](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilfried_Stroh) PhD ([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shC9XR_qFrs)) who also [often teaches in Latin](http://stroh.userweb.mwn.de/scholaelatinae.html) and also [publishes in Latin](https://www.jstor.org/stable/26315611); [Andreas Fritsch](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andreas_Fritsch_(Altphilologe)) PhD ([video](https://youtu.be/MeBLS5zAhBc)) who happens to be quite an expert on the [history of Latin pedagogy](https://www.klassphil.hu-berlin.de/de/personen/fritsch) and also publishes in Latin; [Milena Minkova](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milena_Minkova) PhD ([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=120yrY2ySEg)); [Kurt Smolak](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_Smolak) PhD ([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6IMOkj-kA8)), Luigi Miraglia PhD ([this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_OyhWKTmJBo) of his is conveniently exactly about this discussion), until July 2017 the guy even had a [column in a newspaper in Latin](https://www.avvenire.it/Archivio/rubriche/mercurius/2019/7) and [Daniel Gallagher](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Gallagher) ([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh0vjaUdcDE)) among many many others that I won't bother to mention, take a look at the [Global Latinists](https://medium.com/in-medias-res/global-latinists-3e089959fad1) article for further info.\n\nAll of them have the methodological evidence to support a CI-based teaching and the palpable evidence of their students being able to read, fluently any Latin text you put in front of them (for example a [class of Virgil](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMKcBl2e-os&list=PLfku8EBM-vSJngxGnxpiFS1t4eKPwoFG1&index=51) and a[nother one of Lucretius](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhy77Mng_NY&list=PLfku8EBM-vSJngxGnxpiFS1t4eKPwoFG1&index=155)). \n\nIn sum, people like them or [Christophe Rico](https://www.ebaf.edu/les-enseignants/christophe-rico-2/) PhD, also a [youtube enthusiast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJrGaOF-bOw) if you will, are right and the rest of the Classics departments that are wrong. Fortunately this is slowly changing and soon the Classics departments will go through a much needed update like [Princeton](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfnw6oBq9w) is doing or like [Western Washington University](https://www.theodysseyonline.com/princeton-living-latin-wwu-latin) has already done.

Do you come from a monolingual culture (aka, France, USA, UK, Spain)? Will you be learning with a teacher or on your own? Will you be taking part in a conversation club/study group or not? How many hours can you effectively study each day? (emphasis on effectively, having an hour a day where you are relaxed out of worries and full of energy is way better than stealing three hours a day from your sleep after working 16 hour shifts in a coal mine). Will you be also solving the [Exercitia](https://exercitia-latina.netlify.app/chapters) or just the pensa?\n\nAll of these factors can influence the time it will take you to get your brain used to Latin, but none of them are deterministic in anyway. I have seen everything from the obsessive maniac that does it all in less than six months to the distracted guys that do everything slowly and take three years. None of it should matter to you, you know best how you learn and your personal, material or social circumstances are known only to you, only you can determine what's reasonable and possible.\n\nThat said, as in everything, consistency and discipline is the key. Think of it as going to the gym, it's simply no use to break your arms on the first day, this is a marathon not a sprint.\n\nThere are some general recommendations [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/latin/comments/fah7mp/function_over_form_why_llpsi_works/), [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/latin/comments/i8imrn/why_youre_frustrated_with_llpsi_and_how_to_use_it/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/latin/comments/fkw2zz/functional_pedagogy_teachlearn_relative_pronouns/).\n\nIn general I'd recommend to read twice each chapter, one normally and one very slowly (both out loud). If there's anything that simply you don't get, write with down and read it out loud many times then read the whole paragraph a couple of times *before* you take a look at the student's manual or the Companion. Take a break and relax. Then try to do the pensa (specially the C or open questions) or the exercitia.\n\nAre you capable of answering those questions? If not. Is it because of the grammar, the vocabulary or because of you simply forgot what happened in the chapter? Ideally you will have consulted the manual, the companion or the discord if the problem is the grammar. Once you've determined that, you can read the chapter a third time. You should at the very minimum have understood enough to answer the open questions. Under normal circumstances you should have archived this by the third read, don't be afraid to ask for help and guidance (with specific questions) here or in the [LLPSI discord](https://discord.gg/Ubd58Wk).\n\nNo need to memorize everything, though I recommend to memorize just the sentences that cause difficulty.", "created_utc": "1619292670.0", "edited": "1619292889.0", "id": "gvqovfw", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_mxq5dr", "parent_id": "t3_mxq5dr", "score": "12", "subreddit": "latin", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qloa"}, {"author": "Indeclinable", "body": "This [exact question](https://www.reddit.com/r/latin/comments/g78egf/what_happened_to_people_who_actually_read_latin/) was made a year ago.", "created_utc": "1619272825.0", "edited": "False", "id": "gvp7zu9", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_mxj4kd", "parent_id": "t3_mxj4kd", "score": "1", "subreddit": "latin", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qloa"}, {"author": "Indeclinable", "body": "Hi!

Another book that you must consult as and example is [Forum](https://www.amazon.com/Forum-Lectiones-Latinitatis-Speaking-Language/dp/9657698073/) (if you have the time, do take a look at the other \"[Nature method books](https://vivariumnovum.it/risorse-didattiche/propria-formazione/metodo-diretto-applicato-alle-lingue-moderne)\").\n\nIf you want to optimize your time I'd recommend to just take the basic structure of Familia Romana (*if possible, try to get you department to adapt to the grammar as presented by \u00d8rberg and not the other way around*) and just make the minor adjustments that Llewellyn suggests (I have the [list of grammar content per chapter](https://ibb.co/mvCLxYX) (in Spanish) and I can share it with you if you send me a PM, another one is free [here](http://www.culturaclasica.com/lingualatina/07_Contenidos_y_secuenciacion_temporal_del_curso.pdf)).\n\nFor the content itself, you can do it yourself *ab ovo*, or you can take ideas from other [out-of-copyright material](https://vivariumnovum.it/risorse-didattiche/pratica-didattica/libri-scolastici).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>How often should words repeat?

Try to follow \u00d8rberg's structure as much as you possibly can, with the exception of the points mentioned by Llewellyn and the vocabulary necessary for dialogue (as *Forum* does way better, in my opinion).\n\nThe most important thing to keep in mind is that your chapters **must** be a connected narrative **supported by images**, aka what happens in chapter 1 must be the prequel to what happens in chapter 2, and the vocabulary form chapter 1 must be somehow present in chapter 2 and so until it is learned.\n\nThe two worst mistakes to avoid is a) having chapters with vocabulary that never or seldom is repeated and b) using \"weird\" vocabulary that is not common in the corpus (for this I'd also recommend to just use the vocabulary that \u00d8rberg uses but with minor adjustments like dividing long chapters into smaller chapters).\n\nAlso, I do have to say that people like [Lance](https://magisterp.com/ci-materials/) who teach pre-high school students and who advocate sacrificing a high (I'd say minimum) standard of *Latinitas* or correctness of style and word-choice in order to make your text more comprehensible using cognates present in English (even if that word is almost never used in real Latin) are questionable, specially if your target audience is college-level students.\n\nLastly, don't just stop with the development of the \"alternative \u00d8rberg\", make also an alternative \"Colloquia personarum\" that supports and reinforces what you present in your reader, you can take ideas from [other colloquies](https://vivariumnovum.it/risorse-didattiche/pratica-didattica/colloquia-scholastica).", "created_utc": "1618955671.0", "edited": "1618956075.0", "id": "gv96ekn", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_muzqjh", "parent_id": "t3_muzqjh", "score": "10", "subreddit": "latin", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qloa"}, {"author": "Indeclinable", "body": "I've only read a couple of pages out of curiosity, it seemed to me significantly more elegant than say Euler, but it's still really simple Latin, it is after all the work of a mathematician trying to convey ideas to other mathematicians as straightforwardly as possible. \n\nPerhaps u/sjgallagher2 has an expert's opinion on the subject.", "created_utc": "1618938359.0", "edited": "False", "id": "gv80o5t", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_mut6dj", "parent_id": "t3_mut6dj", "score": "6", "subreddit": "latin", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qloa"}, {"author": "Indeclinable", "body": ">I see nothing wrong with including conversational Latin (even if about  modern concepts that would've made no sense to Romans) to get students  to think in Latin.\n\nNeither do I, but conversational Latin for the purposes of teaching the actual attested Latin (from Rome until the 21st Century) is not the same as trying to revive the language. Only if you're trying to do the second (like, to get your local McDonalds employee to speak to you in Latin) would I understand the need to *systematically* breach a basic principle of grammar that's been a constant from the earliest inhabitants of Latium until today (though I would question the whole enterprise).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>this assumes that Latin only belonged/belongs to the Romans\n\nNo, it most certainly does not.

Even a guy as tame and amiable as Erasmus would be considered questionable by today's standards.  My point is, even if you take into account the whole of bibliographic production in Latin until yesterday, it all fundamentally represents a worldview that in many essential aspects (the use of gender being just one of them) conflicts with our own. I think, that's precisely why it's important to teach it as it is.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>If you're willing to accept the semantic variation of these words in a  Christian context, why not new uses of pronouns in a modern sociological  context?\n\nThere is an enormous difference between semantic variation (a phenomenon very common an attested even between Caesar and Cicero) and changes in grammar.

They all stem from the basic fundamental problem of teaching Latin: Why do you learn/teach Latin? Depending on the answer it may or may not be justified to use Latin neuter to refer to people that wish to be addressed that way.\n\nIf your objective is to revive Latin as a common everyday language (aka, you want Latin to be used just like French or Spanish is used) I could see your point. But then the problem arises. Is it sensible to have such an objective? If one is concerned about how minority groups are treated or represented in today's society and language, what is the purpose of revivifying a language that's part and parcel of a culture that's essentially incompatible with our modern values and ideas? (Think of all the positive connotations that being male and virility have in Latin, the very positive connotation of all things war-like and aggressive, and the blatantly patriarchal and hierarchical underlying presuppositions of all vocabulary related to law, religion and morals) You would have to completely mutilate Latin out of its essential semantic and cultural presuppositions to more or less arrive at something that could perhaps match your standards. Then you will have two problems, someone that has been taught this \"inclusive Latin\" (basically a new language) would have severe problems understanding something written in Latin by anyone who is not from the 21st Century. Also, would it then not make sense to just skip Latin altogether and learn a new conlang?\n\nTo put it in another way, imagine that you're inspired by the work of [Victor Klemperer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_Klemperer) and want to study how Nazis used language to instil in people their cultural biases and values and how their ideology and life-style is reflected on their language (basically what all philologists aim to do with the Greek and Roman culture). Would it make sense to try to make the phraseology and vocabulary used by the Nazis more inclusive? Isn't the purpose of the academic to take things as they are and to understand them in their context?\n\nThat is the other possibility, you try to teach your students Latin as has been left to us and explain it in its historical and cultural context. I myself am a very staunch supporter of using Latin actively in a classroom but not with the purpose of having it become the new English, only with the purpose of understanding what Latin speaking people have left us (in this I agree with [Miraglia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_OyhWKTmJBo) 100%). If I did otherwise I'd eventually end up with a new romance language and unable to archive my primary purpose: reading texts written by people that lived before me.\n\nEven common \"neutral\" words like \"yes\" have no direct equivalent to Latin and the point of there being no direct translations for \"yes\" is not just to re-lexify your English-speaking brain with Latinate terms but to *learn to think in Latin*. I always recommend Owen's [Barbarisms at the Gate](https://muse.jhu.edu/article/628829), for this type of discussion.\n\nAnother misunderstanding is the term \"Church Latin\" that can mean everything and nothing, you can have something like Alegre's [Iliad](https://books.google.com/books?id=QvJ5yaW_Qk0C), de Jouvancy's [Ratio discendi et docendi](https://books.google.com/books?id=CZNgwBnM2sQC) or Landivar's [Rusticatio Mexicana](https://books.google.com/books?id=VzYDEAAAQBAJ) all of which can be considered \"Church Latin\" but are written in the most elegant and strict style of Virgil and Cicero; on the other hand you have horrible and heinous monstrosities like the Vulgate (remember that Jerome supposedly was writing a normal \"Ciceronian\" Latin translation and was reprimanded in a dream, he was accused of being \"Ciceronianus non Christianus\" and apparently the guy was so scared that he vowed never to read the classics again); which can and is considered by people, even deeply religious people, \"bad Latin\", read for example the works of Emilio Springhetti or Cletus Pavanetto or even at times Reggie Foster.\n\nAnd even in the case of the most adventurous and purposefully rule-breaking of modern or early modern Latin writers you never see the breaking of the elemental grammar rules because they are immediately condemned, and rightly so. So, yes the Romans have in many ways the final authority on how Latin should and shouldn't be used even in modern contexts (if your objective is to teach the Latin that has been the [World Language of the West](https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674058071)).", "created_utc": "1618852357.0", "edited": "False", "id": "gv3pgpy", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_mtwqpu", "parent_id": "t1_gv39fzm", "score": "9", "subreddit": "latin", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qloa"}, {"author": "Indeclinable", "body": ">You will find quickly that there is a cult of LLPSI in this sub.\n\nThis is false.

Do you need to translate it into any other language? Of course not, and of course there might be a few moments of uncertainty and doubt, but at the end, all parents are capable of explaining their children relatively complex subjects in just their native language. As has been said [before](https://www.reddit.com/r/latin/comments/a422r4/in_or_out_of_orberg_nancy_llewellyn_explains_the/), the student needs to \"struggle\" to develop the observational skills necessary. \n\nThe benefits of translation that Kingshorsey speaks about I've seen only in intermediate or advanced students.

I've several friends in Germany, France and Poland whose students also have the same average time.\n\nIn a self-learning setting all bets are off and it depends entirely on the student.

Whatever useful and practical information any book may provide, it is not Latin. My main purpose is to teach Latin, once my students are capable of understanding my explanations and stories in Latin I tell them those kind of things, in Latin (they enjoy it very much). There's actually many books that teach that sort of things (in Latin) like Paoli's [Ciceronis filius](https://vivariumnovum.it/edizioni/libri/fuori-commercio/Paoli%20-%20Ciceronis%20filius.pdf) or Millard's [Ecce Roma. De vita cottidiana Romanorum](https://archive.org/details/millard-anne-ecce-roma-de-vita-cottidiana-romanorum). There's even a [LLPSI book (in Italian)](https://vivariumnovum.it/catalogo/vita-moresque) made specifically to teach those kind of interesting facts, obviously it is not very popular precisely because is not in Latin.\n\nI understand that other teachers like Lance argue against this Latin only approach. And with good reason, as he teaches primary school kids that may never even have the opportunity or interest to read real Latin, so he tries his best to teach \"English-cognate based Latin\" so as to give them a feel of what Latin was like and get them to understand basic grammar (He explicitly argues against any consideration for style or elegance or even \"standard\" forms of Latin in favour of made up Latin that's transparent via cognates for monolingual anglophones). Despite this limitation he does a very good job, I think. In his particular context (primary school kids, monolingual Anglophones, very limited amount of time) I agree with him, some English might be necessary. But even then I consider that his argument has limits. As the example of [St. Theresa Catholic School](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6pER6empz8) and [Schola Nova](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzqlBYp_Xr8) have shown it is perfectly possible to teach little kids with only Latin, even to teach other subjects like History, Greek or Music in Latin, but it does require a very knowledgeable and dedicated teacher.\n\nIf, however, you're trying to teach a student that's mentally mature enough and your purpose is to get them to read real Latin, I'm convinced that a Latin only approach is not only possible, but necessary and, in the long run, more fruitful. I understand that there are cultural problems (specially among monolingual cultures, like the one in the USA), but it is the responsibility of ANY language teacher to break his students' monolingualism and their almost pathological recourse to their native language. This is how I was taught and how I've been teaching with success for many years. It is also the method sponsored in the [Vivarium Novum](https://vivariumnovum.net) and [Polis](https://www.polisjerusalem.org/), among other reputable schools.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>having a section after every lesson that's called *Applicability to English* would certainly be *desirable* for those same students that learn best through parallel and analogy\n\nIs it really desirable? Maybe to an Anglophone culture and country. LLPSI aims to be universal or as universal as possible, it is used in at least three different continents.\n\nYou can of course say I'm biased, and I am. I firmly and unquestionably believe that Latin is valuable in and of itself and I don't need to look for any real or alleged \"secondary benefits\", most of them are fallacious or false and the parents and the students themselves can tell. I have to respect their intelligence, their time, their effort and their money. Also providing a section of \"Applicability to English\" kinda suggest that your main interest is English (in which case, you should study English) or that languages and cultures are justified if they are relevant to other cultures or languages (in this case anglophone ones) something which is self-evidently false.\n\nI have a taught a lot of future STEM geniuses and other than a general lack of interest in languages in general, I have never met any problem with my \"target language only policy\" as it is in accordance to modern scientific consensus. See [Krashen](https://www.sk.com.br/sk-krash.html), for example. [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_EQDtpYSNM) is also very educative.", "created_utc": "1614015382.0", "edited": "1614016437.0", "id": "god0w6l", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_lp3xmm", "parent_id": "t1_goctu19", "score": "2", "subreddit": "latin", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qloa"}, {"author": "Indeclinable", "body": ">it does not explain to the student, in clear English, **why** he should want to study Latin.\n\nIf this is a problem, it is a cultural problem, not a method problem. While I have seen anglophone books of math trying to explain or justify why it is important to study math. I gather that pretty much every student that studies math seriously knows its importance and does not need to be reminded of it. In any case is the responsibility of the teacher, not the bookmaker to explain this.\n\nAs for the justification that Gray and Jenkins offer, it is basically: Latin helps you know English, helps you know Romance languages, study law and sciences, and helps you know the Romans. Let's go through it one by one (I'm going to play the devil's advocate here, suppose I'm a STEM-minded, money-driven, materialist parent whose only objective is to make sure his kid earns a ton of money, everything else is useless).\n\n1. Latin helps you know English. Undoubtedly knowing Latin can help you better understand etymologies and help out if you're reading Literature, but you can perfectly find that information in a dictionary, a Google search or consulting any good encyclopaedia. So while something that could be desired, it is, strictly speaking, not necessary.\n2. It can help you understand technical terms of the law and the sciences. Again, true. But if we're trying to optimize time and resources, all of that info comes in a dictionary or a Google search. (Here I speak from first hand experience, I taught many years Latin to law students and have given etymology courses to physics students, both of those people hated and loathed my courses, mainly because they were mandatory and, I believe they are right, they were not necessary, even the dean did not take my courses seriously and basically forced me to pass everyone just because. All of my students, even the ones who I know learned nothing from Latin or Greek or etymologies, have gone on to become very successful and competent physicists and lawyers).\n3. Latin can help you better learn Romance languages. Again, true, but not necessary. This argument I find particularly harmful, because there are tons of students that have a genuine interest in learning French, Spanish or Italian. I also, happen to teach French or Spanish occasionally, and I would never sabotage their efforts by putting Latin in between their true and sincere interest. It's Occam's razor, pure and simple, you should not put extra elements when they are not needed.\n4. Latin helps you know the Romans. This is the one true argument, as no real or deep understanding of the history, language and culture of the Romans is possible without Latin. But even then, most students' interests in Rome is superficial enough so as not to require it or as to make them less diligent than necessary. Just take a look at /r/classics or r/ancientrome (and this is not a pejorative or dismissive or condescending comment) most of what they talk about or are interested in, can be solved with a good translation, of which many are available. This argument also presupposes that the student has an interest in the Romans at all.\n\nIn my humble opinion, the only reason for studying Latin is because of its cultural and historical value, not only in regards to the Romans but concerning the whole Western Culture. For that there are good books like [Leonhardt](https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674058071), [Waquet](https://blackwells.co.uk/bookshop/product/Latin-or-The-Empire-of-a-Sign-by-Francoise-Waquet-John-Howe-translator/9781859846155) and [Stroh](https://www.perlentaucher.de/buch/wilfried-stroh/latein-ist-tot-es-lebe-latein.html).\n\n>The French, Italians, and Germans have the Assimil Method, but for  Anglophones who prefer English as the language of instruction, there's  nothing really comparable, either for love or for money.\n\nThis is completely false. LLPSI does offer the possibility of English instruction, even if it's rightly recommended not to do so (this has been discussed [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/latin/comments/a422r4/in_or_out_of_orberg_nancy_llewellyn_explains_the/)). There's the [Latine disco](https://www.hackettpublishing.com/lingua-latina-per-se-illustrata-series/familia-romana-part-i/lingua-latina-pars-i-latine-disco-student-s-manual-in-english), the [Companion](https://www.hackettpublishing.com/lingua-latina-per-se-illustrata-series/familia-romana-part-i/lingua-latina-a-companion-to-familia-romana-second-edition) and even a [teacher's guide](https://www.hackettpublishing.com/lingua-latina-per-se-illustrata-series/lingua-latina-latine-doceo-a-companion-for-instructors).

The case system is not what's difficult but what comes after. The case system can be referred generally as \"grammar and/or morphology\" in layman's parlance.\n\nWhat people mean by syntax is basically \"complex sentence structure\", most commonly what causes trouble is the famous \"*consecutio temporum*\" and \"clauses\", the many uses and possible meanings of subordinate clauses and subjunctive mood. So it's more the verb and it's \"correct\" and/or \"elegant\" use what's problematic not the nouns or adjectives.\n\nBut if you are interested in *only* \"ecclesiastical Latin\" (generally people tend to limit that to just the Vulgate and common prayers and liturgy, like the Missale Romanum, or even Augustine or Aquinas or some other popular scholastics) then you most probably will never encounter much problems with Latin syntax (understood as a \"correct\"/elegant ciceronian stylistics) as that almost doesn't exist in those writings.\n\nIf, however, you enlarge the meaning of \"ecclesiastical Latin\" to include things like Jerome's rhetorical exercises or the typical Jesuit baroque prose that basically tries to outcicero Cicero, then you will struggle. Or if you ever try to read Renaissance/Humanist writers or Classical authors.\n\nIf you are on the second case, there's good books that you could use as reference.\n\nThe most user-friendly and self-learner friendly and accessible introduction to Latin syntax is the chapter \"Syntaxis\" of LLPSI's [Grammatica di consultazione](https://vivariumnovum.it/catalogo/grammatica-consultazione) (which is now also included in the [Italian Latine disco](https://vivariumnovum.it/catalogo/latine-disco)), but it is in Italian. \\[By the way. I would also recommend to replace Collins with LLPSI which is made for the self-learners.

Overall a good reference book to have.\n\nDo avoid the famous [Oxford Latin Syntax](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/oxford-latin-syntax-9780199283613?cc=mx&lang=en&) as it is not user-friendly or beginner-friendly at all, but has the academic linguist as its target audience.

That is a truism of SLA research. But it is far much complex than that. See DeKeyser's chapter *Age effects in second language learning* in the [The Routledge Handbook of Second Language Acquisition](https://www.routledge.com/The-Routledge-Handbook-of-Second-Language-Acquisition/Gass-Mackey/p/book/9780415709811). I quote:    \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>what does the empirical literature show? Nobody doubts that a strong negative correlation between AoA and ultimate attainment is found for many aspects of both grammar and pronunciation; nobody doubts either that some individuals often pass for native speakers in everyday interaction, even though they learned a language as an adult. Neither of these two observations have much to say about the existence of a critical period; the second one not even about age effects. In fact, **a strong negative correlation between age of acquisition and ultimate attainment throughout the lifespan (or even from birth through middle age),** **the only age effect documented in many earlier studies, is** ***not*** **evidence for a critical period**. As pointed out above, the critical period concept implies a break in the AoA-proficiency function, i.e., an age (somewhat variable from individual to individual, of course, and therefore an age range in the aggregate) after which the decline of success rate in one or more areas of language is much less pronounced and/or clearly due to different reasons. \\[...\\]   (445)   \n>  \n>In summary, the core questions are whether there is a specific period of decline in the ability for implicit language learning, and whether any such decline is due to maturational factors. These questions sometimes lead to unnecessary confusion because of the **failure to distinguish between implicit and explicit learning**, between speed of learning and ultimate attainment, and between various aspects of language; not all aspects of grammar or even phonology are equally sensitive to age effects \\[...\\]  (p 446)      \n>  \n>Research on age effects has only begun. We need much more documentation of what aspects of language become harder to learn at what age, and much more research on the immediate and ultimate causes. One avenue to pursue is a wider variety of more sophisticated measures, whether they be of the neurophysiological or neuro-imaging kind or \u201csimply\u201d involve clever use of behavioral measures elicited under laboratory conditions, involving reaction time measurements, priming conditions, eye tracking, and so on.  (p 456)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat in no way means or implies that using a Comprehensible Input based method of language teaching ceases to become effective or *the* most effective way to teach and learn languages. You just miss out on certain level of mastery that you wouldn't get with other approaches anyway. \n\nSee also the conclusion of Herschensohn's *Age-related effects* chapter on [Cambridge Handbook of Second Language Acquisition](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/cambridge-handbook-of-second-language-acquisition/C2EEC3E576CE742479072423050F3A51):\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Deficits in endstate L2 include phonology, morphosyntax and processing differences from native monolingual performance. Pronunciation may deviate from the native profile in vowel space, consonant features and suprasegmentals. Morphosyntax is less vulnerable than phonology, but often reveals problems with features non-existent in the L1 and morphological performance errors. *Comprehension and production in real-time processing also show deficits in slowed reaction time, lower accuracy and non-native processing strategies*. Finally, as Abrahamsson and Hyltenstam emphasize, **proficiency is not a monolithic and homogeneous ability comparable in all learners \u2013 individuals show different areas of expertise or deficit in L2 sub- domains**. So is there a sensitive period for L2A and what are its dimensions? The range of evidence presented in this chapter indicates that **childhood is indeed a more sensitive period for acquiring a post-maternal language, but the period is not a critical one; it does not have a categorical terminus and its dimensions vary individually due to a number of additional external and internal factors.**  (p. 337)\n\nIn short: You're making the perfect the enemy of the good, and have yet to provide any evidence that grammar-translation has a direct causal effect on language acquisition.  \n\nI'll just quote again the standard bibliography.\n\n>\\[...\\]  Grammar Translation \\[...\\] is a method for which there is no literature  that  offers a rational or justification for it or that attempts to relate it to issues in linguistics, psychology, or educational theory.

And while it is true that there is contention among specialists about how to measure proficiency, it most definitively is not what grammar-translation provides.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>After decades I have gotten pretty good at it.\n\nI believe you.

This has been discussed before ([here](https://www.reddit.com/r/latin/comments/fah7mp/function_over_form_why_llpsi_works/), [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/latin/comments/i8imrn/why_youre_frustrated_with_llpsi_and_how_to_use_it/), [here](https://eidolon.pub/teaching-latin-to-humans-4e6b489b4e17) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/latin/comments/gvqjfh/grammartranslation_vs_reading_method_which_is_the/)), but that's beside the point.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>It's a great resource, but it does have its flaws\n\nYes, indeed it does. But lack of proper grammar explanations is not definitively not one of them, all of the points you mention are covered. This is like when the [court musicians criticize Mozart's music as having \"too many notes\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCud8H7z7vU).", "created_utc": "1601149183.0", "edited": "False", "id": "g6pqhrz", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_j08h8k", "parent_id": "t1_g6pkc4s", "score": "4", "subreddit": "latin", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qloa"}, {"author": "Indeclinable", "body": "1. Reeditions of \"\u00f8rbergeized\" beginner-aimed reading material and colloquies (with pre-coocked Q&A): The examples of free of copyright material that could very easily be adapted are endless, see [this](https://vivariumnovum.it/risorse-didattiche/propria-formazione/colloquia-scholastica), [this](https://vivariumnovum.it/risorse-didattiche/propria-formazione/fabulae-scaenicae), [this](https://archive.org/details/den-kbd-pil-130018162653-001/page/n8/mode/2up). Ideally with pictures or Latin-Latin vocabulary that clearly states which words are new and which are present in FR. \n2. New reading material based on LLPSI (or at least following the pace and order of presentation of grammar and vocabulary) that breaks down the vocabulary and grammar into smaller reading sections. Particularly necessary candidates are the \"Great Divides\" that [Nancy Llewellyn mentions in her presentation](https://youtu.be/adv_lbelCJk). For example chapter 6 could and should be divided into at least three smaller chapters, the same goes for chapter 8 that also requires a lot of dialogues and *realia* based live conversations to properly exemplify the demonstratives. \n3. The same but applied to Roma Aeterna, which I believe is more urgent. I'm sure that small booklets that introduced bit by bit the new vocabulary would be a most welcome aid for students. A good idea would be to introduce that new vocabulary through colloquies that made reference to a live school-like situation or through videos like those [Jessie Craft](https://www.magistercraft.com/) does. \n4. If you can take the heat of over-sensitive \"pronunciation pundits\", audio books of the material mentioned in point 1 would also be welcomed.   \n\nI genuinely do not understand this complain about the alleged lack of grammar in LLPSI, as the book contains a grammar section at the end of each chapter and there's two grammar books ([Latine disco](https://www.hackettpublishing.com/lingua-latina-per-se-illustrata-series/lingua-latina-pars-i-latine-disco-student-s-manual-in-english) and [Companion](https://www.hackettpublishing.com/lingua-latina-per-se-illustrata-series/lingua-latina-a-companion-to-familia-romana-second-edition)) specifically made to explain the grammar in each chapter. Each of those offer a more than clear explanation of the grammar. Unless you want to make a reference guide that points to an authoritative grammar (say, to put in chapter 9 a little note that says, for more info in the third declension see [K\u00fchner \u00a762](https://archive.org/details/ausfhrlichegra01khuoft/page/296/mode/2up)) I do not understand what you could possible explain that's not already explained.\n\nEven if the learner in question does not care that the whole point of LLPSI is to *familiarize* yourself with the grammar *through* the text. The matter is quickly solved by a quick glance in either the *Latine disco* or *the Companion*.\n\nIf you want to make your own independent material the example to follow is [Forum](https://www.polisjerusalem.org/resource/forum-lectiones-latinitatis-vivae-audio/).

And not only that, a lot of background knowledge under your belt (aka you have read at the very least the Latin prose canon) so that you may know what [Haacke](https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=hvd.hw2spa&view=1up&seq=5) or [Menge](https://archive.org/details/RepetitoriumDerLateinischenSyntaxUndStilistik) or [N\u00e4gelsbach](https://archive.org/details/lateinischestili00ng/page/n3/mode/2up) are talking about when discussing about the different options to express in Latin foreign ideas or modes of expression.\n\nFor a student that is just beginning, or even one that has already finished FR, that sort of knowledge is usually lacking, so English to Latin exercises will have to be incredibly simple or evident so that they will not be any more useful than the open questions of LLPSI or [Laplana's exercises](https://archive.org/details/summasyntaxicacu00lapl/page/n7/mode/2up) that have the advantage of keeping the learning monolingual.\n\nMiraglia and \u010cepel\u00e1k always preferred to go through the following procedure:\n\n1. Variation, based on LLPSI and the open questions (see pages 26-8 of \u010cepel\u00e1k\u2019s [*Adumbratio*](https://www.academia.edu/8845691/Lingua_Latina_per_se_illustrata_methodi_qua_tirones_doceantur_adumbratio_n%C3%A1stin_metody_pro_v%C3%BDuku_za%C4%8D%C3%A1te%C4%8Dn%C3%ADk%C5%AF) for the more advanced examples of this, also see [Miraglia's example at 01:05:17](https://youtu.be/Igviyxf6qks?t=3917)).\n2. Amplificatio (see pages 29-34 of the Adumbratio).\n3. Creative [Storytelling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TPR_Storytelling) (See Paolo's [excellent demonstration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBZDUef6cdM) of this or [Jones' book](https://www.worldcat.org/title/latin-picture-stories-being-a-new-method-of-teaching-composition-edited-by-whs-jones-twelve-cards-etc/oclc/562222772)).\n4. Free composition.\n\nOf course by then the student will be already done with RA and most (if not all) of the supplements. So there is little to no room in the curriculum for English to Latin translation in the LLPSI course, but there's more than a considerable amount of time to be dedicated to composition, be it oral or written.\n\nThat said, English to Latin translation begins to make sense when reading authors, once the students are fully independent sight readers and can write full (even if simple) ideas on their own without dictionary or other aids, specially if they really want to delve into that specific author's style. For example when reading Caesar or Livy, Sargent's [book](https://archive.org/details/easypassagesfort00sargrich/page/n5/mode/2up) (or [books](https://archive.org/details/materialsmodelsf00sargrich/page/n49/mode/2up)) can be very fruitful, as [Gandino](https://vivariumnovum.it/risorse-didattiche/propria-formazione/composizione-e-versione-nelle-lingue-classiche)'s books will be for those reading Cicero. Right here a 5th step (imitation or use of an author's style as instrument for free composition) makes sense. But even then, the use of Minkova & Tunberg's book can work better in a school environment where a panoramic view of many authors is expected instead of a focus on a single one, or with students that are not really into a single author.\n\nBut even in most of the exceptional cases where a book like Sargent's or Gandino's makes sense, argues Miraglia, (and I agree with him), it is usually far more fruitful (and interesting) to read [what Erasmus or Dolet or Valla wrote about Latin style and composition](https://vivariumnovum.it/risorse-didattiche/propria-formazione/stile) and follow their composition exercises instead of doing English to Latin translation.\n\nThe only place where English to Latin composition seems to be indispensable is poetry. For that [Lupton](https://archive.org/details/latinlyricversec00lupt), [Walford](https://archive.org/details/seriesofprogress00walfrich), [Granville](https://archive.org/details/progressiveexerc00geppuoft) and [Rouse](https://archive.org/details/demonstrationsla00rousuoft) are invaluable. Why is translation here necessary here and not with prose? Because it's very easy to prompt students into writing prose stories and then build up from whatever they come up with. Poetry on the other hand is something that most students shy away from, so it's much more easy to give them \"pre-coocked\" things to translate. Also, forcing the student to write something following the metric rules, learning prosody, and showing how the poetic vocabulary provides many \"chuncks\" that can be used as lego blocks is a process that is hard enough so as not to be worth the putting the extra burden on students of actually coming up with the subject themselves.\n\nDoes that mean that there should be no place in a beginner to intermediate course for English to Latin translation ever? No, of course not, the problem is that the existing material is either extremely easy, then it's no better than LLPSI or Laplana, or, it is so prescriptive and conceptually arid so as to require a very advanced level of Latin, if a student already has that much Latin, he does not need the manual to learn, just to rehearse (think of Menge or N\u00e4gelsbach) or to look for very specific solutions for very specific problems.\n\nI personally think that if one were to make a \"translation manual\" with limited, clear and sensible objectives (teaching a specific vocabulary or phraseology) it could be very productive, for example a manual (or manuals) that is (are) based on the content of [Meissner's phraseology](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/50280) and adapted to the vocabulary of LLPSI (Mainly of Roma Aeterna), could be a very useful tool for students that want to quickly learn the phraseology in Meissner without having to \"hunt\" it down one by one \"in the wild\" or do blind memorization.

There's no established path. If you do pursue this, you will be making pioneering work. The only thing necessary is to know Latin and some basic but firm notions of textual criticism.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Do I go to graduate school for Latin American, Renaissance, East Asian Studies and simply focus on Latin?\n\nThat's a possibility, and in fact a necessity if you want to dedicate yourself to things that are not 100% European.\n\nIf what you want is to enrol in an M.A. that's more or less firm and fixed with a Neo-Latin focus, the following are most pre-eminent: [Kentucky](https://mcl.as.uky.edu/latin-institute), [Bonn](https://www.uni-bonn.de/studium/vor-dem-studium/faecher/renaissance-studien/renaissance-studien-master-of-arts),  [Innsbruck](https://www.uibk.ac.at/latinistik-graezistik/), [Leuven](https://www.arts.kuleuven.be/sph), [K\u00f6ln](https://ifa.phil-fak.uni-koeln.de/abteilungen-einrichtungen/mittellateinische-philologie) and [Jerusalem](https://www.polisjerusalem.org/program/ma-in-ancient-philology/) (other good options you can find [here](https://www.uni-goettingen.de/de/mittel-+und+neulateinische+einrichtungen/118272.html) and [here](https://www.uni-muenster.de/Mittellatein/links/index.html)). There you'll find all the institutional support and the best teachers in the world to guide you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>It seems like the language is strictly in the domain of Classics.\n\nYes, this is one structural problem. Neo-latin needs scientists, biologists, botanists, demographers, linguists, historians, theologians,  engineers, architects, medics, anthropologists, etc. It will be a long time before the discipline has enough scholars versed in these subjects if the main pool of human resources are the Classics departments.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>I'm curious about the role of Latin during the age of European exploration and the colonization of Latin America\n\nNow this is an area that I happen to be very familiar with, and there's bad news. You'll have to chop stones and open a path almost all by yourself as there is practically zero institutional support for Neo-latin in Latin America.\n\nFor example I know of no one (alive) that does serious work in Neo-Latin in Peru, Chile or Bolivia.\n\nIn Colombia there is the [Caro Cuervo Institute](https://www.caroycuervo.gov.co/) but all of its great scholars are dead and I have not heard of anyone doing serious work there (nor of anyone who could be considered fluent in Latin).\n\nIn Mexico all the work done by the late [Ignacio Osorio Romero](http://ru.ffyl.unam.mx/handle/10391/3237) at the UNAM has pretty much been abandoned by everyone except by [Ra\u00fal Torres](http://clasicas.filos.unam.mx/dr-raul-torres-martinez/) and he has no institutional support to speak of in regards to Neo-latin, I would say that there is even an open opposition from the Classics department there and from other universities.\n\nIf you really want to study Neo-latin produced in Latin America your best bet would be to do so from an overseas university and go there just to consult archives.\n\nIf you really want to enrol in a Latin American University your best option would be the Colmex either a [PhD in History](https://ceh.colmex.mx/index.php/doctorado-en-historia/acerca-de) or [Hispanic Literature](https://cell.colmex.mx/index.php/posgrados/doctorado/literatura-hispanica), there you'll find the best institutional support for innovative research but I can't think of anyone there who has enough Latin to properly guide you, you will need to do some convincing for a professor to agree to \"supervise\" you. You'll have first to do an MA on one of the places I've recommended (to get the necessary skills) and then go to Mexico to work pretty much on your own, or with the unofficial supervision of someone like professor Torres.\n\nThere is a reason for this poor state of affairs. Latin American academics in general have an anti-spanish bias (for historic reasons) and pretty much resent dedicating time or effort their colonial past, they much prefer to focus on their independence movements, their post-independent civil wars or revolutions. The Mexican example is interesting.\n\nAfter the victory of the liberal party against the conservatives and the franco-austrian invasion, president Ju\u00e1rez and his education minister decided that anything that was even closely related with the church had to be suppressed, so Latin and Greek were wiped out. After the revolution there was a catholic uprising that was also suppressed and marked the spirit of the modern Mexican state. Also there's a very strong line of marxism in most Mexican universities specially in the history faculties. Add to that the nationalist ethos of most governments and you have the perfect recipe for there not to be an interest in Neo-latin.\n\nThe good news is that there's an exponential growth of young Latin-fluent scholars in Mexico, Argentina and Brazil, the number of private Latin schools keeps growing, so it is to be hopped that in a few years this situation may change, Spain has the fastest growing numbers of competent Latin teachers.

I could write a whole book on it and still not answer it fully or adequately.\n\nFor starters I will point you to the most relevant bibliography. The best summarily introduction is [de Smet's four-page review](http://www.jstor.org/stable/300741). IJsewijn's Companion ([vol 1](https://lup.be/products/99312) [vol2](https://lup.be/products/99639)) is indispensable. The best introductions to the subject are [Helander](https://www.cems.ox.ac.uk/documents/helander.pdf) (also [here](https://doi.org/10.1080/003976701753387950)), [Verbeke](https://lirias.kuleuven.be/retrieve/293907) (most recent version [here](http://dx.doi.org/10.1163/9789004271296_enlo_B9789004271012_0066)), [Hankins](https://scholar.harvard.edu/jameshankins/publications/lost-continent-neo-latin-literature-and-birth-european-vernacular-literatu), [Ludwig](http://www.rhm.uni-koeln.de/146/Ludwig.pdf) and [Thurn](https://journals.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/index.php/pegasus/article/download/35506/29155).\n\nThe only attempt to make a history of Neo-Latin is [Korenjak](https://www.chbeck.de/korenjak-geschichte-neulateinischen-literatur/product/16037995), but is still very much a work in progress since he is almost only focused on Europe.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>What particular fields of knowledge is Neo-Latin usually explored in?\n\nFor obvious reasons much of the focus and much of the progress has been done in Europe with focus on Neo-latin works produced on Europe. Say... Petrarch, Erasmus, Valla, etc (things like [this](https://www.degruyter.com/view/title/504000) or [this](https://brill.com/view/title/24268)). Even those works that have so far looked at other parts of the world are very much focused on European heritage (aka Literature). For example, my mentor and his students have researched a lot the Neo-latin Literature made in Latin America like [Alegre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francisco_Javier_Alegre)'s Iliad or his Batrachiomachia (which one of my *senpais* believe to be a sort of justification for the Spanish conquest).\n\nBut even so, it is still pretty much focused on Literature, as is to be expected since most of the people who have sufficient command of Latin have a background in Literature. But Neo-Latin is much more than Literature, there are scientific or proto-scientific works written in Latin, there's works of botanic, history, biography, diaries, travel guides, you name it. So there's a lot of debate on how all this should be approached, undoubtedly we need an inter-disciplinary approach but it is still pretty much a matter to be solved.\n\nThe whole Neo-latin discipline is still in underpants, there is no scholarly consensus on how we should work or what methods to use, see [van Hal's excellent article](http://www.jstor.org/stable/23974123) on the subject.\n\nFor example, (and again returning to Literature), how should we approach the [Latin translations of Goethe and Schiller's poems](https://books.google.com/books/about/Carmina_aliquot_Goethii_et_Schilleri_lat.html?id=c0U4AQAAIAAJ&redir_esc=y)? Undoubtedly some cooperation with our Germanists friends is necessary but the details are still to be worked out (nobody to my knowledge has treated this particular subject yet). It is an undeniable fact that many people knew Goethe only though Latin, not German. The same can be said about Hobbes' *Leviathan* or Machiavelli's *Prince*, so you could do a very interesting history of reception with this.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>How rare/common is it for scholars of modernity to know Latin?\n\nVery rare, but those that do, happen to be exceptionally good. Think of Tunberg, Sacr\u00e9, Watanabe, Malcolm. Korenjak is a monster, his post-doctoral dissertation was supervised by Michael von Albrecht and Glenn W. Most, that's like having your divinity degree supervised by Saint Peter and Aquinas.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>what insights can we gain through it that we can't gain by means of vernacular languages?\n\nMany, look at Helander's article for some examples. For starters there is an infinite number of books and documents that have never been translated or even edited, and there's books that were only relevant at the time because of the Latin translation. I recently read an [excellent book](https://www.degruyter.com/view/title/6947) on the diffusion of Natural Law and it underscores constantly the importance if books that were only available in Latin even in the 19th Century.\n\nI'm currently researching Latin works published in Japan in the 16th Century, mostly by the Jesuits. It was the first encounter between European intellectuals and a culture that they regarded as equal, it was related to the evangelization process but it was much more, it was about learning new concepts and coming to terms with a foreign religion that had as much prestige and antiquity as christianity. Since the early christianity no European christian had ever had to face a culture with another religion that it could not simply conquer and destroy or decry as barbarian. There were an infinite number of debates on how to translate \"god\", and an herculean effort to compare the native idea of divinity and if (and how) it could be adapted to suit christian needs, not only in Japan but in China.\n\nIn short, you could approach just this problem from an anthropological, historical, linguistic, theological or philosophical perspective. And of course a historical one, the failiure of the Jesuit endeavour in China to [adapt confucianism to christianity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Rites_controversy) marked the beginning of the end for the Jesuit enterprise. But the mark they left in those cultures in terms of the introduction of medicine, astronomy and commerce changed forever the way we see they and we saw the world. The Latin-Japanese or the Latin-Chinese dictionaries and grammars that were made at the time are today the most important pieces of evidence of historical linguistic and cultural research made about old Japanese or old Chinese.\n\nThe impact of the Jesuit descriptions of China and of Confucianism divulged in Europe (in Latin) [on the Enlightenment](https://www.uni-hildesheim.de/media/fb2/philosophie/J\u00e4ger_AZP-Artikel.pdf) or in the thought of people like [Leibnitz](http://www.jstor.org/stable/2707344), [Voltaire](https://doi.org/10.1016/0191-6599(92)90168-C) or [Montesquieu](http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10848770.2014.898927) is just being researched. For example, Nietzsche's much critiqued misrepresentation of Buddhism as promoting \"nothingness\" and nihilism is a cultural heritage that he got from Schopenhauer that traces back to the Jesuit reports and descriptions of Buddhism.\n\nMaffei's [history of the \"Indies\"](https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=ucm.5325288396&view=1up&seq=5) was an example and model for historians of Latin America like [Juan Luis Maneiro](https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_CpbhvkvXkSkC/page/n9/mode/2up) and is to be suspected that all Latin-american Jesuits knew it very well. How much of an influence or impact had the Japanese or the Chinese in the world through the Neo-Latin works of the Jesuits will be hopefully my subject of doctoral research one day.\n\nHow would you approach an [book on psychology](https://archive.org/details/Psychologia7/mode/2up)? Or [on astronomy](https://archive.org/details/COSMOLOGIA_201704/page/n1/mode/2up)?

A model based on experiments (including brain scans aka MRI like [this](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S091160441400061X) and [this](http://csjarchive.cogsci.rpi.edu/Proceedings/2006/docs/p2293.pdf)) made on different languages that show the exact same result on all languages. There actually is a \"right way\" to learn languages aka Comprehensible Input. If you take a look at the bibliography that's already been quoted you'll find the evidence to support it.\n\nThere are in fact two whole disciplines called [Cognitive Linguistics](https://books.google.com.mx/books/about/Cognitive_Linguistics.html?id=vrafVlXvFmcC) and [Neurolinguistics](https://www.cambridge.org/mx/academic/subjects/languages-linguistics/psycholinguistics-and-neurolinguistics/neurolinguistics-introduction-spoken-language-processing-and-its-disorders?format=PB) that deal with this stuff.

There's also plenty of people around the world that use Latin as an every day communicative language (see [here](https://medium.com/in-medias-res/global-latinists-3e089959fad1?fbclid=IwAR2a5-wU-2BvoZx8Ejul1fzXNCsJGnKjO5hk5rR48Dac5umUJZH2GJpnkMI), [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/latin/comments/9aamb7/the_latin_speakers_of_west_virginia/), [here](https://medium.com/in-medias-res/the-vaticans-latinist-92451bdb5dec), and above all [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eGDrlpaImCk&t=48s)). [Even little kids can speak Latin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6pER6empz8). I have friends with whom I have never spoken or written with in any language but Latin. Just last week a friend of mine published an [article about this very topic](https://www.reddit.com/r/latin/comments/gsz5xo/en_symbola_quam_nuper_aloisia_aguilar_scripsit/) *in Latin* in a very prestigious academic journal.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Ancient and classical languages are very different from modern languages.\n\nThis is also false. All languages essentially are the same. This is one of the basic presuppositions of modern linguistics. Look at any, literally any introduction to linguistics, like Lyon's [Language and\u00a0Linguistics](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/language-and-linguistics/C97B6760F31512BDF99DFB4C72E82A1F) (p. 1-33). The books about Cognitive Linguistics and Neurolinguistics I've already quoted demonstrate this in a much more precise (arid) manner.\n\nThe error is that we must not look at how the languages look like in regards to grammar, phonetics and syntax but how our brain process them. There's nothing about the structure or the grammar of a language that makes it harder or simpler to learn, it's just about the availability of sufficient understandable messages (Comprehensible Input) that are interesting or appealing to the learner and graded. This is what [Krashen](https://www.sk.com.br/sk-krash.html) demonstrated in the 80's.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>by giving the student reading proficiency and the grammar basics of a  foreign language, the teacher prepares him to develop speaking  proficiency should the opportunity arise.\n\nThis is a fallacy, it implies that using grammar-translation actually gives the student \"reading proficiency\", when there's no evidence that supports this. Also it presupposes that giving someone \"the grammar basics of a  foreign language\" will \"prepare him to develop speaking  proficiency should the opportunity arise\" and while this is *technically* true, it's very unlikely that the average Latin student will ever want to gain speaking proficiency or even encounter the opportunity to do so. There's actually evidence to the contrary, just look at the already quoted [Koutropoulos' article](https://scholarworks.umb.edu/humanarchitecture/vol9/iss3/6/), he shows that by the very fact that students are introduced to the grammar-translation their world-view is distorted so much that they they begin to treat Latin and Greek as an anomaly that's different to all other languages in the world, if they don't quit first.\n\nI'll just quote again the standard bibliography.\n\n>\\[...\\] Grammar  Translation \\[...\\] is a method for which there is no literature that  offers a rational or justification for it or that attempts to relate it  to issues in linguistics, psychology, or educational theory. ([Richards & Rodgers 2014: 7](https://books.google.com/books?id=HrhkAwAAQBAJ&lpg=PP1&dq=Approaches%20and%20Methods%20in%20Language%20Teaching&hl=es&pg=PA7#v=onepage&q&f=false))  \n>  \n>Very few, if any of the elements hypothesized to contribute to the  development of proficiency are present in the grammar-translation  method. ... Grammar-translation methodology is not necessarily conducive  to building toward proficiency and may, in fact, be quite  counterproductive. ([Omaggio Hadley 2001: 106-107](https://books.google.com.mx/books?id=OtnCQgAACAAJ&dq))  \n>  \n>It is remarkable, in one sense, that this method has been so stalwart  among many competing models.  It does virtually nothing to enhance a  student\u2019s communicative ability in the language. ... As we continue to  examine theoretical principles in this book, I think we will understand  more fully the \u2018theorylessness\u2019 of the Grammar Translation Method.  ([Brown 2007: 16-17](https://books.google.com.mx/books?id=jUF0QgAACAAJ&dq))\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is going to sound aggressive, it is not, please take no offence. But so far we've quoted (with the exception of the divulgatory YouTube videos that are nonetheless explaining what scientific research tells us) only academic bibliography, papers based on experiments and published by peer-reviewed respectable journals.\n\nThe only thing you came up with was the **opinion** of Cheryl Lowe. She wasn't even a Latinist, she was a chemistry major. She was no linguist, she was no scientist, she published no academic research. As far as I can tell she was completely ignorant of even the most basic introductory notions of linguistics or neurolinguistics. And I'm positive that she never heard anything about [Second Language Acquistion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second-language_acquisition), or Krashen's research. What papers does she quote to support her statements? What experiments did she conduct to demonstrate her hypothesis? Everything she claims goes against the academic consensus regarding languages and language pedagogy and there's not a single shred of evidence that supports her **opinion**, published by her own publishing house. Worst of all, she has an economical interest in preserving the status quo. Any high-school teacher would have failed her if she had presented her **opinion** as a final paper.\n\nSo, there's no conundrum. No reason at all not to apply modern SLA research to Latin. And to be fair. Mrs Lowe is right about the difficulty of implementing a reasonable teaching environment when you only have 1 hour a week, but that's all I'll give her.\n\nOf course, I'm open to debate, so if you have any real article, based on actual experiments, or at least quoting the academic literature that's based on experiments, let's compare and if necessary re-run the experiments.

There's a [discord](https://discord.gg/5ZGqZWG) group where you can ask for help and guidance. \n\nThe words that today we use in scientific terminology come from a wide variety of authors, some classical, some medieval, some of the Renaissance, some from the Early Modern Period (see: [Neolatin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Latin)) and often they are a mixture of Greek and Latin. \n\nYou might want to read Leonhardt's [Latin: Story of a World Language](https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674058071), Waquet's [Latin: Or the Empire of a Sign](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1859846157/) to get a rough idea of what I'm talking about.", "created_utc": "1591289879.0", "edited": "False", "id": "fsvlso5", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_gwkfe9", "parent_id": "t3_gwkfe9", "score": "3", "subreddit": "latin", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qloa"}, {"author": "Indeclinable", "body": "Like FireyArc said, you can logic your way into comprehension but is very time-consuming and frustrating. [Most people fail in the attempt](https://scholarworks.umb.edu/humanarchitecture/vol9/iss3/6/). OP asked for what's most effective. Places like the Polis Institute or the Paideia Institute have shown that a single summer can be enough to get sufficient CI to become an independent reader.  \n\n>Latin texts were composed to be read slowly, authors deliberately made  decisions so that the reader has to consciously reprocess what they have  read.\n\nTrue, but I see no contradiction in first getting fluency and then learning the intricacies of a deeper analysis. Just like it makes sense first to learn English and then tackle Shakespeare. Doing first what's easy and then what's difficult is common sense. \n\nThose texts were composed to be reflected upon by people who used the language as an everyday communicative tool, so getting that ability gives us insights that otherwise would be lost. Also, most of what we have was meant to be singed, recited or read aloud.   \n\nAs dhammapada186 [mentioned](https://www.reddit.com/r/latin/comments/gfe1ex/justinians_institutas_on_proper_education/), the ancients themselves thought that even their laws could best be taught by teaching the easy stuff first.\n\n>Another point is, that communicating is not the goal of latin classes.\n\nNo, it is not. But SLA demonstrates that communication speeds up the process of acquiring fluency dramatically, that's how all languages are learned, plus it's fun. If you can teach something to someone without boring him, why would you go out of your way just to bore someone unnecessarily? Why make artificially difficult something that is natural and easy? We are not [the first ones](https://scholaeinterretiales.wordpress.com/) that have proposed a better way to teach Greek and Latin.\n\n>if it were, it would compete with better suited languages, which would render latin and greek absolutely useless.\n\nI disagree. Both Greek and Latin have a cultural value, so even if the objective was communication, they would remain valuable in and of themselves.", "created_utc": "1591252754.0", "edited": "False", "id": "fsu2ful", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_gvqjfh", "parent_id": "t1_fstytxn", "score": "6", "subreddit": "latin", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qloa"}, {"author": "Indeclinable", "body": ">If you want to read, read.\n\nPartially agree. As Dr. Buth explains in the [conference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWOjBulEyrs) I quoted in the other comment. Scientific research has shown that even if the objective is merely to read, the best way to archive reading fluency is by hearing the target language at least 90% of the time, he quotes [Walter (2011)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/j.1545-7249.2008.tb00141.x) and [August & Shanahan (2006)](http://www.standardsinstitutes.org/sites/default/files/material/developing-literacy-in-second-language-learners-executive-summary_2.pdf) on this.

Students do not learn English: They learn grammar, at the expense of other things that matter as much or more. They know the main rules, can pass tests, and may have the illusion that they know the language well. However, when it comes to using the language in practice, they discover that they lack vital elements, typically vocabulary and fluency: They can recite irregular verbs but cannot sustain a conversation. (As J. K. Jerome put it a century ago, few people care to listen to their own irregular verbs recited by young foreigners.) Such an approach is also psychologically counterproductive, in that it tends to make students nervous of making mistakes, undermining their confidence and destroying their motivation. \\[...\\]  \n>  \n>What points of grammar we choose to teach will therefore depend on our circumstances and our learners\u2019 aims. Whatever the situation, though, we must make sure that we are teaching only the points of grammar that we need to in the light of these factors, and \u2013 of course \u2013 that we are teaching them well. If we can manage to focus clearly on these principles, we have a better chance of teaching *English* instead of just teaching grammar.   \n>  \n>[Richards & Renandya (2002: 151-52)](https://books.google.com.mx/books?id=VxnGXusQlI8C&lpg=PA151&ots=qhxmndczoK&dq=Where%20grammar%20is%20given%20too%20much%20priority%20the%20result%20is%20predictable%20and%20well%20known.%20%E2%80%98Course%20books%E2%80%99%20become%20little%20more%20than%20grammar%20courses.%20Students%20do%20not%20learn%20English%3A%20They%20learn%20grammar%2C%20at%20the%20expense%20of%20other%20things%20that%20matter%20as%20much%20or%20more.%20They%20know%20the%20main%20rules%2C%20can%20pass%20tests%2C%20and%20may%20have%20the%20illusion%20that%20they%20know%20the%20language%20well.%20However%2C%20when%20it%20comes%20to%20using%20the%20language%20in%20practice%2C%20they%20discover%20that%20they%20lack%20vital%20elements%2C%20typically%20vocabulary%20and%20fluency%3A%20They%20can%20recite%20irregular%20verbs%20but%20cannot%20sustain%20a%20conversation.%20(As%20J.%20K.%20Jerome%20put%20it%20a%20century%20ago%2C%20few%20people%20care%20to%20listen%20to%20their%20own%20irregular%20verbs%20recited%20by%20young%20foreigners.)%20Such%20an%20approach%20is%20also%20psychologically%20counterproductive%2C%20in%20that%20it%20tends%20to%20make%20students%20nervous%20of%20making%20mistakes%2C%20undermining%20their%20confidence%20and%20destroying%20their%20motivation.&pg=PA151#v=onepage&q&f=false)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>The advantage of the grammar approach is that from the very beginning  you're trained to justify the text as it is and trained to get every nuance, not just the broad sense.\n\nActually, it is the opposite. SLA research suggests that humans learn languages by getting \"the broad sense\" of messages and then working it down into nuances, not the other way around. That would lead to no learning at all at best, or to confusion and frustration at worst:\n\n>Very few, if any of the elements hypothesized to contribute to the development of proficiency are present in the grammar-translation method. ... Grammar-translation methodology is not necessarily conducive to building toward proficiency and may, in fact, be quite counterproductive. ([Omaggio Hadley 2001: 106-107](https://books.google.com.mx/books?id=OtnCQgAACAAJ&dq))\n\nSo, if in fact GT were capable of getting the student to \"justify the text\" that he is not understanding and to \"get every nuance\" of a message whose general meaning has eluded him, it would be a disadvantage not an advantage. \n\nOf course, no analysis or grammar explanation can ever replace true (aka unconscious) understanding of a message as Dr. Burth demonstrates in his conference. \n\n>For the last 20 or so years the commentaries/editions especially from younger scholars got worse. Some problems aren't even addressed to the point where I have to ask myself, how did he understand the text \\[...\\]\n\nI agree, my hypothesis is that it is because they never learned (better yet, never *acquired* the target language), most probably because of the grammar-translation method [imposed](https://scholarworks.umb.edu/humanarchitecture/vol9/iss3/6/) on them. \n\n>It is remarkable, in one sense, that this method has been so stalwart among many competing models.  It does virtually nothing to enhance a student\u2019s communicative ability in the language. ...
