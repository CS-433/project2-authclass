Not a pro, I just really love this silly little game\n\n1- Without going into much detail there are 4 main types of weapons, Snipers, Rollers, Splattershots, and Blasters. Snipers usually do well in defense, not ideal for ranked mode since those are usually more fast paced, but I\u2019ve seen pretty good ones in high ranks. \nRollers, pretty solid, have more of a complementary role, good to turf in turf war, and good in splatzones. \nSplattershots, I call these your classical shooter weapons, there are a ton of types but they are usually good for covering turf in turf war and playing offense in any other mode, I main the Splatter shot, and even the \u2018beginner\u2019 splattershots are pretty solid.\nLastly blasters, these are more of strategic weapons, they\u2019re not as fast as splattershots (some of them, the Clash Blaster is fast) but not as slow as snipers, they usually get the target with one or two hits at close range, and have a gigantic blast radius, perfect for ranked battles not so much for turf wars.\n\n\n2- I wouldn\u2019t worry much about gold medals, but if you get more you can level up in rank more faster. That is, don\u2019t be afraid to get \u2018carried\u2019 we all start somewhere anyway.\n\n\n3- Splatfests are pretty casual, since they\u2019re turf war it doesn\u2019t involve rank so people just don\u2019t mind it. You just rank up with the titles, and independently if your team wins or not, you still get rewarded for it.\n\n\n4- Take a break and come back, I\u2019ve been playing salmon run mainly for this reason, if I loose two battles I quit.. and come back other day when I have better spirits. Also you can find a mode in which you feel much more confident.. I mainly play splatzones to rank up really.\n\n\n5- Yeah! Don\u2019t worry about it, if you get gold even though you lost, they reward you for it.\n\n\n6- I do 2~3 hours a day, or around two rotations when I\u2019m really bored. I\u2019ve been playing since 1 so I don\u2019t know how it has made me improve, but my sister who barely plays usually adapts well in a month.\n\n\n7- I have no experience with this so I can\u2019t tell, but when I\u2019ve played with friends I\u2019ve done it trough Discord.\n\n\n8- I suggest switching, you\u2019d be surprised at how many weapons can become fun once you master them, or just pick one that suits your fancy. \n\n\n9- I have no experience, so I bail on this one\u2026\n\n\n10- It\u2019s not at all, as I said it all takes it\u2019s pace, even though I was rank X in 2, Im still stuck at S+0 lol. Everyone is trying to rank up at the moment, so I expect next year to be less hard on the first ranks.\n\n\n11- Can\u2019t tell.. I just use pic editors like phonto.\n\n\n12- I mainly use them in splatzones, but I just suggest putting two consecutively in places you think are most likely for the enemy team to fall in. i.e. the tower, near the rainkmaker checkpoints\n\n\n13- If you are not using them: Motion Controls, if you are by chance using them, I suggest always reassuring there\u2019s no enemy team on your side of the turf and when you are inside enemy turf just constantly be aware and looking at your sides constantly. \n\n\n14- Go for It! Im a missiles fan, and besides, it gets good points\n\n\n15- I don\u2019t really watch much Splatoon YouTubers but I casually watch GG Gabriel Gaming, Viantastic and OctoBoy\n\n\n16- It\u2019s actually good, it keeps your mind cool when returning to either of them and it doesn\u2019t get repetitive.\n\n\n17- It depends on how many points you accumulate inking with that weapon, in Splatoon 2 you got badges even, I haven\u2019t played much turf war, so I can\u2019t tell with Splatoon 3.\n\n\n18- Depends on how much you play, the catalog is an easy grab and can complete it under a month if you grind hard enough. Leveling up depends on your wins and points you get, but even then you can grab food tickets and double the points you get, leveling up faster. Either way, levels aren\u2019t really visible this time around, so unless you want a bigger locker you shouldn\u2019t worry too much.\n\n\nI see a few people answered by now, but I leave this around~", "created_utc": "1666586715.0", "edited": "False", "id": "itjx4kc", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_ybh3zp", "parent_id": "t1_itjqm6p", "score": "3", "subreddit": "splatoon", "subreddit_id": "t5_324q4"}, {"author": "m4imaimai", "body": "It really depends on what you like, since it\u2019s a new game there still has to be more maps and things added.
