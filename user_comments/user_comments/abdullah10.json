Personally, though I haven't used either, I would tend towards Wanikani. In my view, the merits of Genki don't extend beyond an introduction to Japanese and learning simple sentence structure and basic grammar. I think once you have that nailed, as you seem to have done, you ought to move on to a more input-based approach. Of course I appreciate that Genki is one of the best books for learning Japanese. I just don't believe in a book-based approach in the long term.  Granted, books can be a great supplementary resource, but they should not guide your learning strategy.\n\nThis is just my opinion, but the \"learn a sentence structure -> try to use it\" approach is ineffective and unnatural, in the long term. Your brain does a lot of subconscious processing when it comes to language, analysing its patterns and subtleties. So while you might find it easy to reproduce the simpler sentence structures, I believe that it will become too difficult at some point to produce, without absorbing a lot of the language patterns and learning a lot of vocabulary.\n\nIn terms of Wanikani, it seems like we both have similar reservations, which is its inflexibility. Yes, you can't skip words you don't want to learn. In this case, I recommend Anki. It offers all the flexibility you (we) want while still being an extremely effective memorisation tool.\n\nAs for your question about kanji. I'm sorry I'm not sure I understand the question. Are you asking if it's better to learn Kanji as vocabularly, e.g. \u6708\u66dc\u65e5 is moon/weekday/sun = sunday, or to learn them piecemeal, as in \u6708 is moon/month, \u65e5, is sun/day ?", "created_utc": "1660697418.0", "edited": "False", "id": "iklgk40", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_wpvzgu", "parent_id": "t1_ikjof88", "score": "0", "subreddit": "LearnJapanese", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qyls"}, {"author": "abdullah10", "body": "Thank you, yeah that was definitely encouraging to read.

The thing is, language is not systematic, it is fluent and abstract, you can't dismiss a word because \"you dont need to know it yet\".   \nIf your ultimate goal is to engage with the language in a meaningful way, then you have no way of knowing which words you will need and which you won't, especially when it comes to watching media and/or reading books. These words are not \"taking up brain power\", you are learning.

But I mean, that's only natural considering how abstract Kanji can be. I think that tying Kanji to one, general meaning, from which you can derive the other meanings of the Kanji, within the context of the vocab in which it is used, is quite useful.\n\nA good example for me is \u5206 - \u3075\u3093. RTK gives it the keyword of \"part\" which makes sense in the 2 most prominent uses of the Kanji: 1) \u5206\u304b\u308b - to undersand - \u308f\u3051\u308b; and 2) \u5206 - \u3075\u3093 as in \"minute\".\n\n1. Is to 'pick apart' a topic/break it down to 'parts' in order to make it more digestible - i.e. to understand it.\n2. Is a small unit of time, a 'part'\n\nThis example might be overly simplistic but it works with most of the Kanji I've encountered in Vocab form.

I got through a significant amount of the Japanese tree on duolingo before I branched out to additional sources, but I would say that was when my Japanese learning truly kicked off.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I think duolingo is great: it's fun, well-designed, and inviting. But ultimately I think it's not good enough by itself. I prefer to use it as a supplemental tool to more rigorous resources, such as anki. \n\nI still use duolingo every day (gotta keep up the streak!) but I've learnt to use it as a 'means' rather than an 'end'. What I mean by that is that I tend to go on it when I'm too fatigued to do my anki reps or read manga, in other words, if I'm just not in the mood to learn Japanese; since using duolingo is easy and fun, it's like a kiddie pool of Japanese in which I can dip my toes a bit. That's usually enough to inspire me to do my japanese learning. I do have the goal of finishing the Japanese tree but if your fiance intends on completing the whole tree before moving to other resources, I actually think he would be under-utilising duolingo. The additional resources I have been using (such as anki) have actually significantly improved my duolingo experience and I've found them to be quite synergetic.\n\nFor example, I would say that duolingo does a relatively poor job of teaching Kanji; so when I used an anki deck that taught me kanji really well (Recognition RTK), I was able to read the more complex sentences in duolingo, even when the app didn't really require me to do so, in order to answer the question. In other words, I was able to gain a deeper meaning of each question, more than duolingo was requiring. That's actually one of my main problems with duolingo, it can be too easy. You can infer the translation without necessarily understanding too much of the target language sentence. It would be really cool if they somehow incorporated a difficulty gauge where you can opt not to see the english translation at all..Idk \n\nAnyway, TLDR: duolingo is great and underrated (especially on this sub). It's true that it can be too easy and more of a game than a learning tool. But imo it varies a lot from user to user, and it's entirely possible to be challenged massively by duolingo, as well as use it as a valuable resource to supplement your learning. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI would advise your partner to start using some tool to learn Kanji, it will help him a lot with duolingo. My personal recommendation is Anki but WaniKani is really good too (check out the 'Refold' channel on YouTube, as well as MattvsJapan). If your partner continues to use duolingo as his main resource, I'd challenge him to not rely on the english translation to \"guess\" the meaning, but truly focus on the Japanese sentence, and to understand it through the lens of Japanese, rather than English.", "created_utc": "1624486956.0", "edited": "False", "id": "h2tj63g", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_o5apdn", "parent_id": "t1_h2ndnjr", "score": "4", "subreddit": "LearnJapanese", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qyls"}, {"author": "abdullah10", "body": "It absolutely does reduce the rate of transmission.\n\n[https://khub.net/documents/135939561/390853656/Impact+of+vaccination+on+household+transmission+of+SARS-COV-2+in+England.pdf/35bf4bb1-6ade-d3eb-a39e-9c9b25a8122a?t=1619601878136](https://khub.net/documents/135939561/390853656/Impact+of+vaccination+on+household+transmission+of+SARS-COV-2+in+England.pdf/35bf4bb1-6ade-d3eb-a39e-9c9b25a8122a?t=1619601878136)", "created_utc": "1624466017.0", "edited": "False", "id": "h2s8jv0", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_o6bxh2", "parent_id": "t1_h2s1qpl", "score": "6", "subreddit": "conspiracy", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh4r"}, {"author": "abdullah10", "body": "I applied on the 3rd of June and it was processed by the 17th.

As for Inter not winning the treble without him, well that's impossible to know. They had been dominating the league for the previous 4 years so a league title was surely on the cards as they had no actual competition. The cup is kind of a trinket that just completes the set, not much thought should go into it, imo. As for the CL, the standouts in my eyes were Milito and the defence. Again, not undervaluing Sneijder's influence, I'm just putting it in context.\n\nI guess here is how I think of it: Modric can recreate Sneijder's Inter role, whereas Sneijder does not have the skill set to do what Modric does for Madrid\n\n", "created_utc": "1536056153.0", "edited": "False", "id": "e5d9vpu", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_9ctw6s", "parent_id": "t1_e5d9my8", "score": "1", "subreddit": "soccer", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qi58"}, {"author": "abdullah10", "body": "\\> had it not been for the world cup, he wouldn't have made the top 3 at all.\n\nI agree with that, and I don't deny the importance of the world cup either.

That was a horrible final, I felt so bad for the french players.\n\n\n> They didn\u2019t play shit football they played defensive and controlled the game\n\n I said they played defensive and pragmatic football, that is shit in my opinion. I hate that type of football (it's subjective)\n\nTo be honest, I thought that was unfair on all the talent that this french team has, it was unfair on them and it was unfair on the viewers (at least those like me) who had to sit and watch France sit back and defend against teams with worse players. It was embarrassing, imho. I understand that this is a valid way of winning, but just because I understand that, doesn't mean I have to like it. Neither Germany 2014 nor Spain 2010 played defensive football yet they still won the world cup.\n\n> it hurts to hear you have so much hate just because they didn\u2019t play super flashy crazy football\n\nI wasn't asking for super flashy crazy football. But the aspect of football I hate the most is \"parking the bus\". Pogba spent most of this tournament defending rather than attacking, and that to me, sums up this french team. \n\n\n> They played safe because in the modern game currently that\u2019s what it\u2019s taking to win.\n\nI guess that's why I find it so sad, they sold out. They did what they had to do to win, but they sold out and I find that sad.\n\n> That game is the example of why the Joga Bonito isn\u2019t working right now\n\nLike what Hazard said after the France game (paraphrasing): I'd rather lose beautifully than win ugly.\n\nThat's how I view it, I don't expect you to agree\n\n> Look what happened to Brazil for trying to do that\n\nBrazil were not the best team in the World Cup, a lot of their players failed to perform. And if they had played pragmatic and defensive football, and won the world cup, then you better believe that I would be on /r/soccer saying the exact same thing I'm saying now. If you are the best team in the world, then you can play beautifully and win, like Spain 2010, and even Germany 2014.\n\n> it\u2019s what the Italians have been doing to us since the beginning of the sport yet they somehow get admired for it..\n\nWho said I admire it? I don't like it... but at least with the Italians, they are not blessed with the wealth of attacking talent that France have. I mean, this entire tournament, Deschamps has opted to play Matuidi instead of Dembele..\n\nLook, I respect the fact that you love France and support the team and I'm happy for you that they won. But, I'm sorry, I can't help in being disappointed in that French team...Playing defensively-minded football when you have a shit team is one thing, but having the most stacked attack in the entire world, with insane depth and unbelievably talented, young forwards, and yet parking them all in their team's side of the pitch to defend, is just ugly to me.
