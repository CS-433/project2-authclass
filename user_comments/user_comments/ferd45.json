Abandonment such as this, versus a \"stray\" walking around loose, qualifies as animal cruelty/neglect. You can't just chain your pet to a fence and split. It's likely nothing will come of it unless the dog is chipped, and even then the person will claim they gave the dog to a friend or make up other lies because they are a scumbag.\n\nHad this dog been found much earlier in the day, it could have been a case for NYC Animal Care Centers to pick up. But the NYPD is the only agency with the resources and the manpower to deal with animal cruelty 24/7. ACC only has a few employees working in field services and they are not able to cover 24 hours.\n\nWhat *should* have happened is that the police should have responded much more quickly to a 911 call, and upon seeing the dog intentionally abandoned they should have called the ASPCA hotline as they are trained to do. The ASPCA has an entire department devoted to assisting the police with investigations of animal cruelty and treating/caring for the animals while their legal case is resolved. In the case of abandoned animals, they often end up in the ASPCA's Adoption Center.\n\nOP you definitely did the right thing here. It sucks that the cops made it so difficult for you. It will be interesting to see whether they do start to follow procedure and call the ASPCA about this dog. Most cops lack the initiative and judgment to do anything other than what is easiest for them, so they will probably treat this abandonment case as a stray and take it to ACC in Manhattan.", "created_utc": "1662558180.0", "edited": "1662573241.0", "id": "ing72p7", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_x7preb", "parent_id": "t3_x7preb", "score": "5", "subreddit": "nyc", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhu2"}, {"author": "ferd45", "body": "Q.E.D.

There\u00b4s tons of stations and it\u00b4s a good way to see the city and get from A to B quickly. We ended up riding them out to Phoenix Park, which is really nice, though we didn\u00b4t see any deer.\n\nDublin Castle was interesting and I think it\u00b4s free through the end of the year, though I understand that you only get to tour the State Apartments area. And it\u00b4s all self-guided. They currently have an exhibit on the wives of viceroys taking up most of the rooms, but the interiors and architecture are wonderful. St. Patrick\u00b4s Hall is particularly impressive--and not only because my family crest is up there among the flags. We were also lucky in that we wandered through the rooms behind a set of grandparents who were teaching their grandson all about Irish history.\n\nIf you really want to get outdoorsy, take the train or bus to Howth. There\u00b4s miles of cliffside walking trails to hike and the views are the best we\u00b4ve seen near Dublin. It\u00b4s like half an hour by DART; more like 50 minutes by bus. The DART drops you near the small (touristy) fishing village while the bus takes you to the middle of the trail area. You can search Howth cliffside walks to see what you want to do.\n\nBe sure to fill out an Ireland Passenger Locator Form before leaving. We learned about this last-minute and decided better safe than sorry even though it did\u00b4nt seem like a requirement. Well it is. You\u00b4ll need proof of vaccination in order to eat or drink indoors.\n\nI don\u00b4t know if this is your first time to Dublin, but be aware that a lot of places--even pubs--close early even during non-COVID times.
