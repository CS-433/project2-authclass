Ransacked by pirates and merchants and eaten alive trust me. Same thing with the Twin Cord islands since they're canibals and necromancers.\n\nBUT if they got to the suspended spine, they'd be taken in by any of the societies there and introduced to the culture as well, if willing to learn.

But it's not necessary to have a war-filled world where everyone is constantly in conflict, SPECIALLY if your species don't resemble humans at all.\n\nFollowing the philosophy \"I think, therefore I exist\" for example. We'll take it literally for a second, and say if a being is considered alive, it has the ability to make conscious decisions. That opens up to personal beliefs, culture, values, etc really quick, and that's where the 'problem' lies.\n\nIt's hard not to be afraid of things that are different from yours, and fear might turn into hatred as time goes on. Some cultures may have values that completely contradict other cultures values, that also can turn into hatred and conflict. And even when culture is similar, other differences like esthetic and appearance, architecture, etc can cause trouble. It's hard to have ANY developed civilization who is 100% a pacifist, not impossible, just hard. For that they'd have to be especially civilized and educated in tolerance, culture appreciation and social matters! Wich sometimes may involve them having had wars in the past, and learning with them.\n\nBut all of that of course, is based on what can be observed in our world. If you're working with aliens for example, beasts or any other lifeform who diverts too much from humans, it may get easier OR harder to make them pacifists, end even then, the basics of this thinking still apply.\nFor example, if you have a communist hive-like society of small aliens, they may be pacifists because THEIR nature is to work, and work togheter, making it way easier and more natural to overlook differences between them and other societies because they'll see everyone as a peer.\n\nIn general, it just depends really on what you wanna do with your Worldbuilding.

And thus why it shouldn't be one single person deciding what is fair, because their definition may be different. \nAbout the parental leave, I again understand where you're coming from and agree with the fact that fathers should get at least more than they get now, and that it would help with hiring descrimination. But I also can't help but think of the people in less fortunate economic situations, where 1 year is FAR too little; what are they gonna do with the kid once the one year is over? A 1yo cannot deal with itself, but both parents need to work to support the family. So what happens now? I know in europe daycare is affordable, but in most of the world (and most of the countries who have that reoccurring problem) childcare is one of the most expensive things there is, exactly because it is indispensable. Honestly, I think 1 year is too little; but now that is a question that would have to be discussed more in depth and we're not here for that today.\n\n6 - I won't get on the \"I don't think you do\" part, because that would cause an unnecessary discussion. But that is exactly the point, we are INDIVIDUALS. DIFFERENT. And treating everyone equally would cause for LESS opportunities for the majority of the people involved in a fundamental level. How could you expect a blind person to read and write? I mean, you expect it from everyone else in the education system so expecting it from them is treating them equally; but it is absolutely not fair. Of course, we're not talking about disabilities right now, we're talking about gender equality; but I wanted to give you another example and make it clear that not everyone SHOULD be treated equally. The right thing is to treat everyone as individuals, and take into account their individualities.

It isn't a problem by any means, and I think picking on that is kinda pointless tbh. It is just an example of where the idea was rooted.

Both are equally infuriating. Everyone deserves their justice, both man and woman, and laws that say rape was deserved because of what she was wearing and laws that say that he couldn't possibly have been raped are both equally awfull and shouldn't exist. But they both have roots on the same place: the idea that woman are submissive and dumb, and that men are strong and smart; because the woman is dumb, she must've just done it in the moment and regreted it, she's exagerating, she's dramatic. Because the man is strong and smart he cannot possibly expect us to believe he let himself be raped by a woman. Both are wrong, and outrageous assumptions.\n\n2- I don't think so, but again, I may be wrong. It is right that you have to be a certain age, but having children or being married aren't a requirement, much less having a document signed by them allowing you to have a vasectomy.\n\n3- Sometimes equality doesn't mean both are treated the same way, it means both are treated fairly. It's like throwing a chicken and a parrot off a hill and expecting the chicken to fly because it's a bird as well. There should be a ramp or stair for the chicken so both could get to the bottom: fair, not equal. In this case, a woman cannot be expected to be fit for work after dislocating a bone or having a surgery! If people who go trough other surgeries take leave, they should too; it is a health issue. Meanwhile, being a father is more...well, congrats!! But you didn't do much. You don't need recovery. In my country man get a week or even month off parental leave still, to help their wives with their babies until they're better fit to do it themselves, and then the mother is well enough to use the rest of the maternal leave to take care of the baby (because surprise surprise, it cannot feed itself and it wouldn't be productive to bring a crying wobly project of a human being to work).\n\nI do understand where you're coming from with these, but sometimes answers aren't as straight forward as both groups (feminists and MR activists) think they are.

Hi, I'm a feminist (at the core of the word, not just for fun) and I am also a woman, just to make it clear. \n\nI understand where some of your arguments come from, since after feminism became mainstream it just got fucked over by extremists and ppl using it as a buzzword, arguments like; Some woman think they're superior, they just hate man for no reason, etc. That's true, some woman do think that way, but then it's a them problem, not the whole movement's. Thinking this way is just like the argument you most hate \"all men are potentially dangerous\" because, yes, some men are dangerous, very dangerous, but that doesn't mean all of them are. Words I've heard coming from men's rights activist might I add.\n\nThis movement was supposed to deal with the actual problems and stigmas society still holds to this day due to our patriarchal past. A most common example is the unbalanced wages. The stigma with rape and how man most of the time get away with it while woman are prosecuted. And one of the less known ones, but one I take very seriously, the fact that in the majority of the countries a surgery to get a vasectomy can be done with no problems, but for uterus removal you need to be above a certain age, have a certain amount of children and have the permission of your husband (a lesbian? Too bad. Not married? Too bad, your body doesn't belong to you in this department). It's just outrageous that man hold this much power above WOMANS MEDICAL TREATMENT. Above woman at all! Nor man or woman should have privileges, the exceptions being very specific, like woman getting parental leave off their jobs to GIVE BIRTH while most man don't get to (being a father is very awesome and you should get to experience it but you're not the one who just dilated a whole bone and blurted out a child the size of an overgrown melon yk? Nor are the person feeding that baby 5 times a day).\n\nBeing an actual feminist isn't about womans rights, it's about rights period. We should re-level all of them. I personally hate the fact that woman always priority of custody when I know many fathers who are much better than the mothers and are doing so so well for their kid; but that's just something else the movement is trying to fix. Equal rights, everyone. And when we say EQUAL we mean it.\n\nBtw, I do wanna add I agree with the guy who said many feminists make exceptions for the draft. Death is scary, scary AS FUCK. War in itself is very scary, and in the US I bet it's much scarier cuz you guys like to get into conflicts ALOT. And to that is only two options: either the draft stops being compulsory, or the government rewrites the protocol so more people get turned down from the military (in the eventual case of higher influx of people joining, because woman) so the country still has people taking care of things home and on bussiness, and THEN makes it compulsory for both genders. But if it isn't a necessary exception, it shouldn't be made.\n\n(I also wanna note that, the title of the post is \"to feminists who shit on men\". I do not wish to shit on men, actually this post got recommended out of godamn nowhere and I just felt like putting this out there. I have many awesome men in my life and I wouldn't dare disrespect anyone for their gender or political stances coming from a very divided family myself.
