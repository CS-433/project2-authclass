That will definitely help with motivation and with enjoyment, since you already said you listen to a lot of music from this dialect (which you then have an excuse to continue doing by learning it).   \n\n\nI'm sure you're aware, but the challenge with Maghrebi as opposed to Egyptian, Levantine, etc. is that it isn't quite as adaptable as the other dialects to communicate with Arabic speakers from other regions. So I guess it comes down to what's more important to you: the ability to communicate with the widest range of Arabic speakers as possible, or personal passion/interest?   \n\n\nTo answer some of your other questions, there's tons of Arabic music not in the Egyptian dialect, and I'd imagine that most Arab artists sing in their dialect rather than switching to Egyptian. In some cases maybe they do so for a wider reach (can't speak on how common that is), but there's an abundance of music/content/media/shows/movies in any dialect you may choose. So those Algerian artists you are listening to are unlikely to be singing in the Egyptian dialect.   \n\n\nAlready knowing one dialect before learning another will definitely give you a leg up as there's lots of overlap when you dive in.   \nHave you considered the Levantine dialect as an option as well?

It was extremely helpful, and I don't honestly know if I would have passed otherwise.\n\n2: I also signed up for The Portuguese Lab course (https://portugueselabacademy.com/). As I had never studied PT grammar formally, I had to \"go back to basics\" a little bit and this course was helpful. You can pay for a monthly membership, and I believe I just did 1 or 2 months...just enough time for me to review the parts of the language I knew I needed to practice/hadn't ever learned.   \n\n3: I did a loooot of practice tests (which, as I said, I reviewed and corrected with my private tutor afterwards. And if there were certain grammatical points that I kept getting wrong, we'd review them as well).

Honestly, I also feel like I missed on a lot of friendships in high school and college. Most of my closest friends now are ones that I've met as an adult...so it is possible! \n\nOnce major thing is just knowing that it takes patience. You can put yourself out there all your want, but I've found that is often just a matter of being in the right place at the right time that gets you to meet someone you \"click\" with. And that you realistically won't \"click\" with most people you meet. \n\nFor example, I lived in Sweden for two years and for the first year and a half, I had nothing but shallow relationships just because I didn't really meet anyone I could properly connect with despite my efforts. By chance, I met a girl at a meetup I was at, we just instantly \"clicked\" and now she's one of my best friends although we live halfway across the world from each other. \n\nAnyway, here's a pre-pandemic write-up I did a while ago of all the ways I've made new friends. Although I find it pretty exhausting and don't exactly like making new friends (though I do love having them!), I move a lot so learning how to do it has been kind of essential for my sanity. \n\n1) Meetup.com - has meetups for just about any interest/hobby, etc. you can imagine. You can also create your own group or set up an event if what you're looking for isn't there.\n\n2) Clubs for hobbies you have/sports you like - personally, I usually try to join a local running club and a local hiking club. But there are clubs for just about anything out there! Either Google or find them on meetup.com\n\n3) Join Facebook groups for people new to the city and make a post seeing if people want to meet for a coffee/beer sometime\n\n4) Go to expat/foreigner meetups - not sure where you are or where you are from, but I think this still stands even if you are living in your home country (like an American living in the U.S.) In general, I've found foreigners (particularly if they are new to the city) tend to be much more receptive to meeting new people and building friendships given that most of their friends/family are still back home or spread throughout other places. I usually find these through Facebook groups, meetup.com or couchsurfing events\n\n5) Go to Couchsurfing events\n\n6) Take the initiative when the opportunity presents itself - I don't always do this as often as I should, but if you find someone you click with, invite them out to do something else even if it feels a bit forward. Sure, sometimes it won't work out (the person sounds interested but when you try to make plans it just keeps falling through), but you can't take it personally. Some people, particularly if they are kind of established in the city already, don't necessarily have the time/energy for new friends beyond their current social circle (this also probably explains why it can be easier to befriend foreigners/expats).\n\nBut a bit of initiative can go a long way. I can think of two really wonderful friendships I've developed because the other person (not me, unfortunately haha) took initiative right away. One of them we a girl who I met one day at a group run and then invited me to go to her neighborhood picnic two days later. The other was a girl I met at a yoga class who then invited me to go hiking with her the next day even though we hadn't had more than a 15-minute conversation. Their initiative might have seemed a bit forward at the time, but I myself was really looking for friends and I very much appreciated them having the courage to ask.

Plus, she took on distinctly non-slimy approach to it (wayyy different from anyone else in her industry). \n\nIn certain circumstances, you may be able to try the product/service yourself. For example, if they are selling a course you can go through the course yourself and see if you think it's useful and worth the selling price. \n\nBut above all, probably the absolute best thing you can do is look to testimonials, case studies, or other 3rd-party reviews they might have. After all, if the clients/customers are saying they've been helped and received value from working with your client, this is much better proof of the quality of the service than the client simply telling you about it. \n\nIn the best case scenario, you'd actually be able to interview a few of your client's clients directly (I do this often before I begin writing to get insights) and hear how they talk about the product/service. For example, I did this with the clients of the breakup coach above, and I was honestly blown away by how much my client had impacted their lives. In which case, I knew I made the right choice by working with her because I was 110% sold on her skills and my work would ultimately help her help more people. \n\nI've also conducted these client interviews for a small business IT company (whose services were saving the poor overworked office managers who got stuck dealing with IT issues 5+ hours each week....so clearly a genuinely good service) and for a succession planner (a field a usually stay away from, but he brought incredible piece of mind to his clients and really helped them navigate familial issues that they wouldn't have gotten through otherwise, so I took him on). \n\nUnfortunately, you probably won't be able to do these interviews until after you've already taken the job (seems highly unlikely a client would allow you to interview their client when you're not yet working for them). But definitely see if you can get some insight on what their clients are saying elsewhere before you make your decision.", "created_utc": "1595443458.0", "edited": "False", "id": "fywe1pf", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_hvjl01", "parent_id": "t1_fyu1rgk", "score": "1", "subreddit": "copywriting", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qq49"}, {"author": "HiThereFellowHumans", "body": "Just tried as well and same here", "created_utc": "1595435522.0", "edited": "False", "id": "fyvx6y8", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_hvsces", "parent_id": "t1_fyvu7g8", "score": "5", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "HiThereFellowHumans", "body": "I felt this way as well when I first got into copywriting. \n\nWhat I've found the solution to be is simple: only work with clients who actually sell a good service/product that will genuinely help their clients.", "created_utc": "1595383532.0", "edited": "False", "id": "fytx7vw", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_hvjl01", "parent_id": "t3_hvjl01", "score": "7", "subreddit": "copywriting", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qq49"}, {"author": "HiThereFellowHumans", "body": "Right?

Or perhaps you just focus on improving your level of Portuguese now and, once you're at a strong level, head back to focusing on Spanish for a while. \n \nAlternatively, one of the most useful things for me was to learn Portuguese through Spanish. At least for me, something about seeing how one works through the other and connects actually helped me keep them separate in my mind and helped me keep my Spanish fresh (ex. I'd translate new words from Portuguese to Spanish rather than Portuguese to English and also got a book in Spanish for learning Portuguese).", "created_utc": "1586255200.0", "edited": "False", "id": "fmodphz", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_fw4q41", "parent_id": "t3_fw4q41", "score": "2", "subreddit": "Portuguese", "subreddit_id": "t5_2sqn7"}, {"author": "HiThereFellowHumans", "body": "Have you tried looking into refurbished iPods?
