So if you end up working in a shop, and aren't focused on their 'required areas' you wont end up getting the points to stay permanently. \n\nFirstly, it's relatively easy for a UK national to get a two-year IEC working visa for Canada; check out [https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/work-canada/iec.html](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/work-canada/iec.html)\n\nSecondly, you can also go through express entry (the point system is the same for PR) check out; [https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/express-entry.html](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/express-entry.html)\n\nYou can see the point-pool here as well as recent invitations; [https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/express-entry/submit-profile/rounds-invitations.html](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/express-entry/submit-profile/rounds-invitations.html) to get PR relatively easily you're going to need a minimum of 450 points.\n\nThis means you will need to do an English exam (even if you're British), be medically fit (as they perform a medical test), have atleast a degree (MINIMUM) but prefer a Masters Degree, work in a field that is required (such as a software developer)  and having the two years of IEC visa will boost your points.\n\nWhile I only pay $30/month on energy, the COL in some parts of Canada (Toronto/Vancouver) is very high, but the pay is also higher.

How I did it was securing a job before and coming over on a LIMA visa. However, this is a harder approach if you have a lack of experience or there are not many jobs in Canada. I'm not familiar with the Civil Engineering field and the differences between UK/Canada, but if your skills are in demand you can apply for Express Entry.\n\nThis is a point-based-system as I'm sure you have heard of being discussed in UK politics and often Australia is used as an example.\n\nYou can check the latest point call here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/ImmigrationCanada/comments/vsw8ie/express\\_entry\\_draw\\_all\\_programs\\_invited/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ImmigrationCanada/comments/vsw8ie/express_entry_draw_all_programs_invited/) and you can see how many points you will have from your own skills here: [https://www.cic.gc.ca/english/immigrate/skilled/crs-tool.asp](https://www.cic.gc.ca/english/immigrate/skilled/crs-tool.asp)\n\nEven though you're from the UK and will have a good understanding of the English language, you will still need to complete an English test. It's super easy for native speakers, you're looking for 8+ without any revision, especially if you have a Masters degree. You will likely need a medical too, so keep in mind the costs that start adding up, so start saving now.\n\nOnce you have done the express calculator you can judge if you will have enough points to move. IF you do not you should look at an IEC visa. This is a temporary visa that is 2 years (a lot easier to get), you can then get two years work experience under your belt in Canada to increase your points before you apply for another VISA or Permanent Residency (PR).", "created_utc": "1657225074.0", "edited": "False", "id": "if93ji2", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_vs6zzo", "parent_id": "t3_vs6zzo", "score": "1", "subreddit": "ImmigrationCanada", "subreddit_id": "t5_2w94s"}, {"author": "AllMuckNoPuck", "body": "VISA years count as well they're just half the time (0.5 days rather than 1), you do have to be PR though", "created_utc": "1657223772.0", "edited": "False", "id": "if904wh", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_rtdusd", "parent_id": "t1_iegjxuo", "score": "1", "subreddit": "ImmigrationCanada", "subreddit_id": "t5_2w94s"}, {"author": "AllMuckNoPuck", "body": "This.

You also will not be able to buy a house as you will not be granted a mortgage, so you will initially be renting, therefore you will also have issues with the pets as many places do not allow animals.\n\nFirst steps: Use the Express Entry calculator to see if you even qualify; [https://www.cic.gc.ca/english/immigrate/skilled/crs-tool.asp](https://www.cic.gc.ca/english/immigrate/skilled/crs-tool.asp) and then try that route (you can see the current draw numbers at: [https://www.reddit.com/r/ImmigrationCanada/comments/vsw8ie/express\\_entry\\_draw\\_all\\_programs\\_invited/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ImmigrationCanada/comments/vsw8ie/express_entry_draw_all_programs_invited/)), but in my opinion, I'd find a job in the US with a Canadian subsidiarity and ask to be transferred after working there a year. If you decide to go the express route, I'd recommend hiring an immigration lawyer to do it for you as you seem to earn enough to make your life a lot easier with their services.\n\nAs for timelines you're looking at over a year.\n\nOnce in Canada, you will need to then apply for Permanent Residency after you have been here working and paying taxes for some time.
