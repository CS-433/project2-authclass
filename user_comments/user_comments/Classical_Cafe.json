Planning to go into higher education, where we were taught more advanced sciences, calculus, philosophy, and generally the classes that seem more \u201cdisconnected\u201d from reality. These are geared more to teach kids critical thinking and btw these subjects ARE relevant to whatever area kids were planning to study and eventually get careers in. We didn\u2019t learn taxes or workshop or anything, but tbh you can teach those things to yourself when you\u2019ve learned the base foundation for how to study and pick up new skills and subjects.\n\n2. Planning to drop out of high school/work right out of graduation. These were classes that were \u201ceasier\u201d in terms of academics but DID teach the essentials for daily life. The math class was literally called Math in the Workplace & Everyday Life, the science class was called Environmental Science, and you took mechanics, woodworking, and cooking classes. These were NECESSARY, not just in the basic life skills that were taught but even just giving kids a look into how scientists make studies and come to conclusions from the results, in a digestible format.

You could test it by being in a dim room, closing all the holes, and shining a light through your headjoint. If any light escapes through the closed keys, it means you need to get your flute tuned up at an instrument repair shop.\n\nIf that's not the problem, then try just playing long tones on those three notes you're having trouble with. It'll get boring and tedious, but think of it like meditation or yoga. Just take the biggest breath you can, and let all your air out holding that note for as long as you can. Repeat 10x for every note.\n\nIf you have good tone while just holding the note, then you will need to work on fingering and emboucher transitions. Play the note below for a few seconds until you have a good tone, then switch to the note you're having trouble with. Hold that note until the airiness goes away and you're satisfied with the tone you got. Flute emboucher is so specific it changes slightly with every note. Until your mouth is making those changes subconsciously, practice switching between notes extremely slowly and adjusting your emboucher after every change for a few seconds.\n\nHope some of this helps.
