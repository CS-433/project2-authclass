As I said, I'm not familiar with everyday english, so vocabulary was different there (I dropped it almost immediately).\n\nWhy, though? It sounds like this is where you need to focus your efforts and where something like Anki would really be helpful. \n\nAnki is a useful tool at any level. The things that you need to keep in mind is that the material and even the card types that you use in A levels will be very different form those at the B levels. And I would argue that the cards you are making when you start to reach C1 should be even more carefully crafted and planned. When you are studying at the C level (i.e. you have achieved a B2) the amount of time you should be spending on passive input (if you wish to improve) is really high. Depending on how you create cards this can mean you end up with a huge number of cards which will take away time from getting active learning. \n\nLearn how to use Anki well and get it set up so that you are not killing yourself with reviews. \n\nGet rid of old cards that don't make sense to keep around. You may be at a point where you just abandon your old deck and create a new one where you almost exclusively sentence mine and do so for very low but useful frequency vocab. \n\nAt your level of comprehension, it's time to really think about what you are doing when you are not getting passive input. If you are reading a lot and actively watching shows like Friends, Anki will still be useful. But is that really where you want to be spending most of your time?

Here are some premises to the logic that reading is better.\n\n1. All language learners must learn to tolerate ambiguity. You cannot always look things up, you cannot always ask for an explanation. Sometimes you must wait for the meaning of a word or expression to be made clear by context.\n2. People who learn a language will enjoy consuming content in that language more than they will enjoy doing 50 flashcards + flashcard reviews every day.\n3. The learner who gets a sufficient amount of input and trusts the process will eventually learn the top 5000 words in their target language with very little effort. When you get to that point will depend on the amount of comprehensible immersion you get on a daily basis.\n\nI have always favored a hybrid approach. I will do a top \\~2000 words deck while doing some learners content and graded readers. Once I master the top 2000 (nouns, adj, verbs adv), I drop the deck entirely and start reading adding any words that I feel like should be outside of the top \\~7000 words. I trust the process for learning the basics. I still use flashcards, I just do not need a flashcard for mother, father, car, dog, etc. once I have finished the top 2000 deck. I will see those words enough in my reading and listening to never forget them once I have learned them.\n\nOnce the foundation is laid and you can understand a book without having to look up tons of new words all the time, it's time to start enjoying the language you have learned. You don't have to give up Anki or whatever you use. But you should always keep in mind WHY you are doing this in the first place. I bet you are not learning a language because you love flashcards. People have been learning new languages for thousands of years without flashcards. Do more of what attracted you to the language in the first place.

Being compassionate to others is far easier, most of the time, than being compassionate to ourselves. And many times those who are the least willing to be compassionate to others are that way because they cannot extend it to themselves. One of my favorite quotes of any book comes from the *Stormlight Archive*:\n\n>I will protect those I hate, even if the one I hate most is... myself\n\nNo one *deservers* compassion from others. We, as individuals, have to choose to be compassionate for our own sakes. The only other choice is cruelty even if it is cruelty from indifference; and we will eventually turn that in on ourselves. \n\nAnd just to clarify, I recognize there are people in this world who do horrible things.

We can see ourselves and others as monsters and be cruel or we can always try to heal what was broken. These are Steven's gifts, right?

They are taught to be studied. There is a general culture in academic circles regarding medieval languages that sees people who actually wish to speak these languages as \"cosplayers\" or LARPers. These attitudes range from \"isn't that cute\" to \"what a bunch of fucking idiots\" and is rarely positive. Keep that in mind.\n\nMy suggestion would be the following.\n\n1. Start to learn the basics of linguistics and historical linguistics. In addition to this it might be a good idea to learn about paleography. \n2. Read the the texts that are available to you and start to look at how they differ from the modern versions of the languages. Make your own comparisons, learn, ask questions, and figure out where the academics who study this stuff congregate online.\n3.

Production cards should be embedded in some sort of context like a sentence or have a photo as their prompt or with a TL definition. I will even sometimes list TL synonyms to avoid ambiguity of what is intended as the answer. All production cards need to have only 1 possible answer. You can argue the pavlovian association for nearly any type of card that has more than one word. Recognition card with an image? Are you associating the word with the idea or with that specific picture? Sentence cloze? Are you understanding the meaning and why that specific word is required or are you just associating something about the sentence with the word to fill in like a dog with \"Wanna' go for a walk?\" When I feel like I am doing this, I make other cards for that same word. But I only do this for things that I am not using productively that I absolutely should be using. I see it and hear it regularly because it's a common part of native speech but for some reason I have not integrated it into my own speech patterns.\n\n> I don't care if there's a big gap between my active and passive vocabulary, that's not something that can be reasonably avoided anyways.\n\nThis is absolutely true in our native languages as well. But we generally don't recognize the gap for being as large as it is. \n\n>To be clear, there are valid reasons why one might want to mostly or entirely use production-cards, but I think blanket-recommending that to everyone is a mistake. I'm learning Japanese just so I can consume media, using only production-cards would be self-sabotage in my case.\n\nI think this is true. And, IMO, production cards should make up a microscopic part of a beginners strategy. Get yourself up to a B1 level in comprehension and then start hammering away at lower frequency words. If your focus is on speaking and writing well, make them production cards. Or if your focus is really just consuming media, as is yours, what would the point even be? Those same cards can later be transformed into cloze if your priorities change.\n\nWhat I am seeing as the most important point between your comment and OP's article is that not only do different objectives (I want to watch TV but don't care too much about talking) require different strategies but different learning phases require different strategies. The decks I have for my two C-level languages should look VERY different in their ratios of card types from those of someone learning those same languages at an A level.", "created_utc": "1661265020.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ilgkvv7", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_wt6kwv", "parent_id": "t1_il43fh2", "score": "1", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "Luguaedos", "body": "I have a C1 certificate in Italian and I am currently working on obtaining a C2. I still use Anki. \n\nI suggest that you start a new deck and you only add sentences that contain words that are in the lower range of frequency. You can move any existing cards that you want to retain from the old deck into the new one. I had to do this at a point because my old deck just got too large.\n\nI only add new cards a few times a month but I do it in bulk. Using Migaku, I have started to break this rule but that is another story. I still keep my reviews low. But in order for this to work you really need to think about what you are adding and what you are not. Do not add words you are likely to encounter repeatedly even if you do not know the word now. Trust that you will learn it via exposure. If you see it repeatedly and you still don't know the meaning or you feel you cannot use it productively and should be able to, then make a cloze card. Ever since I was intermediate I have made mostly cards for low frequency words and avoided cards  for any vocab I knew I would end up seeing repeatedly in a year.\n\nI have customized my settings so that when I am learning a word I see it more frequently but once the card is mature, the spaces between reviews are fairly large. This helps keep my reviews down. With as much media as I consume, this works for me.\n\nIMO, you should favor sentence cards over simple vocab only cards. And you should think of your deck as a living, changing artifact. Suspend cards that are easy and that you see a lot while consuming media. If you find there are words that you have a hard time learning, add new cards with sentences that contain that word but that test something else like a grammar point or another word.\n\nMy general point here is that Anki is a valuable resource for targeting your exposure to specific words and grammar structures and it is useful at every level. Be strategic with what you add and how many reviews you allow yourself to communicate.

First, you need to read widely in your target language. Even things that you may not normally read in your native language. Second, extensive reading can turn into intensive reading. On the Kindle, when I do not know a word I highlight the sentence, usually including a few of the surrounding sentences for context, and then go back later to make a flashcard with the definition. As long as I get the idea of what is being said, I don't even bother to look it up. Eventually, I know, I will get around to making a flashcard for it. This gives me all the benefits of jut reading for enjoyment but allows me to go back and decide if it makes sense to add the word to Anki. Third, it's not a binary. You do not have to do one or the other. There are going to be things that you find that really fit the topics that you enjoy talking about and learning about. Especially if you are reading news articles and magazines, you can go back to the article and make sure you understood everything. Keep a list of interesting stuff to go back to.

If you are not, you are really missing out, IMO. And the percentages can vary depending on where you are in your learning, what you want to learn about, etc. It's super important not to be dogmatic and not to stick to only techniques and topics you are comfortable with and enjoy.

Like do you sit and think, \"God, look at that fucking baby! It can't even walk! Fucking embarrassing!\" No, you don't do that because it would be unreasonable. Babies are not supposed to know how to walk. The point of being a baby is to learn those things. So it is with all skills. Now let me blow you mind: ***this is also a mental health issue***. You will give *others* a pass on these same things *but not yourself*. I don't know what you were fighting before or if you are still fighting it, but this post shows that you are engaging in behaviors (negative self-talk and disproportionately focusing on negative interactions or outcomes) that are keeping you from pursuing an activity that you are expressing interest in. Time to buy some scissors.... so you can cut yourself some slack.\n\nYou have to learn to be kind to yourself. And I honestly think language learning can be a great help for that. One thing I learned from learning a second language and surrounding myself with other learners is how to make mistakes and not focus on the negative. Not a skill I have always been able to transfer to other areas of my life, unfortunately. Sometimes a mistake or a negative interaction with someone is just that and says nothing about me or my skills. Sometimes, though, I mess up. Either way, I can learn to close the loop on how I react to those experiences. We can let mistakes inform our learning without letting them drive us from it. We can't always control what we feel but we never have to let what we feel control us. \n\nDon't let negative emotions about something that is completely reasonable (sucking at something you enjoy), keep you from it. Learn to extend to yourself the same kindness that you naturally extend to other people in the same situation. Learn to be patient and accept and appreciate the progress you make rather than focusing on how much road is left ahead of you. There is a great quote from an author I love, Brandon Sanderson. It's the oath/ideal sworn by one of the characters who struggles with depression and self-esteem issues (to put it mildly).\n\n>Life before death,  journey before destination  \n>  \n>I will protect those who cannot protect themselves.  \n>  \n>I will protect those I hate.

At a certain point you will bust through most plateaus and reach a natural level at which it becomes so difficult to progress that the normal methods will not address your needs. The amount of time and attention to detail that you need to put in is far higher than the quality of results you see.\n\n1. You can probably improve some with your accent on your own but you may need to work with an accent coach or speech pathologist to polish off what remains of your accent. This is going to be expensive and will take a lot of work.\n2. I am skeptical that an advanced class in Spanish will help you very much in acquiring the structures that have alluded you up to this point. That is not to say that it may not be helpful at all. It may draw your attention to things that you have misunderstood or not quite acquired to the point that you will start to subconsciously pay attention to them more when you are listening or reading. That's a good thing, obviously, but you need to get input from sources that are in registers where things like the subjunctive become important. Which leads me to \"I have a hard time understanding the differences between regular words and slang\". If this is the case, you absolutely need to read more widely. Start reading the kinds of things that would be read in a literature course at a university in the country where your heritage dialect is from. You have to have lots of exposure to different registers to be able to distinguish them. And it's generally through reading and our high-school and university educations that we obtain that knowledge in our native languages. \n3. I suggest you see if there is a local chapter of Toastmasters International in the country of your heritage dialect of Spanish. See if you can participate on-line. The process of watching and analyzing other people who are well educated and speak well while pushing yourself to mimic and use that register will probably help a lot. There is very likely going to be someone attending that would love to mentor you in your Spanish public speaking in exchange for the same mentoring in English.\n\nThe toastmasters thing is absolutely painful and hard to do in your native language. But I believe training like that is helpful. In order to achieve a high degree of competence we generally speaking have to train ourselves *beyond* the point where we wish to be. Take Matt into consideration. People may say he did none of this but he absolutely did just in different ways. He read literature in his target language and through his YT channel he trained himself to speak well extemporaneously in both English and Japanese. Anyone who has never tried that sort of speaking will very likely fool themselves into thinking it's something they can do *well* without training and they are wrong. Once you reach a firm C level, remaining issues you have need to be addressed with surgical precision.

Ive just always found an interest in it, and recently ive started to learn bits of it. But, i live in england, a city not really associated with music.  \nMe and my boyfriend dont plan to move to Nashville or Seattle, maybe go to them, but they dont really have much of an interest in going there much or learning the guitar. I cant seem to muster up the motivation to learn it when i dont feel like there\u2019s a use to it.\n\nWhat would you say to a friend who told you that they did not want to play the guitar because they did not feel they could become a professional musician? That they were thinking about getting in shape, but what's the point if I can't become an olympic athlete?\n\nDo things you enjoy because you enjoy them. u/xanthic_strath has already pointed some of this out but I wanted to underscore some of his points.\n\nThere is a lot of media in Swedish or whatever other language you can enjoy that is essentially cut off to you right now (music, books, TV). Sure, you can read in translation or watch with subs, but it is not the same. And even more important, there are some people out there right now with whom you could form friendships with via Swedish (or whatever other language) whom you will otherwise never get to know. I am a 47 year old American and I have friends that range from their early 20s to 60s in both Brazil and Italy that I would have never met otherwise. We speak via Skype and Whatsapp but that doesn't change how I feel. One, due to health issues in his family, has essentially disappeared and I am worried for him like I would anyone else I know and care for. \n\nSo, like u/eilonwyhasemu mentioned: it's time to decide. Don't sit and waffle about this. Either accept the fact that you think it would be nice to learn another language but have no real intention of actually doing it. Or, embrace it as a part of your identity and start ENJOYING the process of learning. Because there is a lot to be enjoyed. And yes, some of the benefits will not come to you for at least a year. But if you can enjoy the process with all its frustrations and victories, anxiety and exaltations, then you can change from who you are now to someone different; someone who has done something that the majority of people living in an Anglophone country will never do. And you will become a better person for it if you allow yourself to.\n\nIt's going to be a hobby. And any hobby that you pour yourself into can change your identity and expand your horizons. IMO, learning a language is special in the way that it can  impact your life. But not doing it is not a bad thing. It's your time on this planet. And you have to decide what you are going to do with it. But absolutely do not think of learning a language as something \"useful\" that only matters if you are going to live in country.\n\nYou would not apply that same reasoning to someone who wanted to learn to draw well: enjoying making art is enough of a reason. The person doesn't have to become a professional artist. And you don't have to move to Sweden. You can read books you enjoy, watch TV, and make new friends. You don't have to be a translator, move to Sweden, or anything else \"useful\".", "created_utc": "1655728043.0", "edited": "False", "id": "id1vsjm", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_vg9r6i", "parent_id": "t3_vg9r6i", "score": "6", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "Luguaedos", "body": "u/AlexKa94 your post kind of bumps up against some of the rules of the sub.

Your brain already has a structured approach to how it assimilates a new language. While there is considerable disagreement about how it works among researchers, there is no disagreement over the fact that it exists. So you are going to assimilate the grammar when you are ready to do so, regardless of when those structures are presented to you in a course.\n\nEdit: I also want to say that the fact that you need supplementary resources is actually a good thing.

What you describe is not normal performance anxiety. If you were physically shaking, it's a bit more than that. If you are able to get yourself to keep going with these sessions, that can be helpful in reducing the physical response you are experiencing. Mindfulness can be really helpful, speaking from experience.\n2. Many people cannot handle the experience of coming face to face with how badly they are at the language after X amount of time learning.

In the year before the test I consumed around 900 hours of audiobook content (just books, not counting podcasts and TV). All the Harry Potter books and the King's Bridge series and more. I read nearly every issue of Focus Italia for that year. I did the C level oral practice exams with native speakers at least once a week.

For the C-level criteria you must be able to write and produce speech at a high and accurate level in specific registers. Immersion is not writing and speaking. Immersion is certainly a fundamental requirement to be able to meet the criteria for these levels but it is an insufficient one. You cannot simply spray X amount of hours of immersion on a learner and have them suddenly blossom into a C2 with full general professional or academic level command of the language. The reason why we can say this is true is because average native speakers, many of whom may not have read anything more complex than a news paper article since they were adolescents, would not be able to write or speak in the professional or academic registers that are expected by the CEFR requirements for C levels. Yet they have immersed for multiple decades in their native languages.\n\nAchieving C-level competencies in a language, regardless of testing requirements for any specific exam, include writing and speaking in specific registers.

You simply have to do it. IMO, though, it is helpful to combine strategies. Especially at first, you should be listening to a lot of things intended for native speakers, material in slow or easy French, and some things with transcripts.\n\nTake shorts segments of news casts that you have the transcript for ([fr.euronews.com](https://fr.euronews.com)and even *Journal en fran\u00e7ais facile* work well for this) and try to transcribe some of it. Try, try, slow it down if you must, and only if you cannot figure it out should you look at the transcript. Then check what you have against the transcript. Listen to native material while paying attention. Do not just listen passively. Pay attention to what is being said and ***try to figure it out***. Listen to short segments again and again until you get it.\n\nListen to something like News in Slow French both ways. Listen to it attentively and once you mostly understand it queue it up for something to listen to while you are doing chores, exercising, commuting to work or school, etc.\n\nThis is something that will work exponentially. It will take it a very long time to start to get better but once you start to be able to understand and you get the gist of what you are listening to while listening passively, you will improve faster than you can imagine.

The fact that they expect every single adult noble would be killed or put on trial and then executed is fairly clear in itself. So that meets criteria a. Criteria e would also be met as there is no more forcible removal than killing all or most of the parents and then having to have the children raised in another culture as there are no adults left.

You get to C1 by doing C1 things. You do not get to C1 by doing larger quantities of B2 things.\n\n* You need to be reading and understanding long, complex works of both fiction and non-fiction. Read Steinbeck, Stephen King, Orwell, Tolkien, Hawthorne, Pratchett, etc as well as non-fiction books in English on your interests. Read a lot and read widely. So far this year, including audiobooks, I have read 21 books in languages other than my native language.\n* Find a native speaker and give detailed summaries of the books you have read.\n* Get a list of random topics (Toastmasters have lots of different \"table topics\" lists you can use) and speak extemporaneously on the topic for about 3 minutes. Whatever you do, do not allow yourself to say, \"I don't like this, I'll choose another one.\" Pick the topic at random and stick with it. Give 2 \\~8 minute presentations in the style of a TED-X talk this year. Get help from a native speaker in preparing. Get feedback from another native speaker on the final product. But actually give the talk.\n* Write formal and less-formal texts. Write things that range in formality from a college literature essay, to a blog post. Get corrections and feedback from a native speaker qualified to give you feedback. Take a magazine article from a magazine that covers a topic you find interesting, outline it, and then rewrite the article yourself.\n\nEveryone has a natural level that they reach doing typical things in language learning. For most people it is somewhere in the range of B2 level for productive skills. From that point on real, serious effort is required to progress. You have to decide for yourself if that degree of effort and sacrifice is worth the progress you will make. You can do the work in groups of 90 days where you focus on a specific skill and then take a break. But you will need to continue your efforts after a few weeks if you want to maintain the gains you made previously and continue to make progress. Most people will be more than happy with a high B2 (which is honestly a low C1). If you want to go beyond that, you need to put in effort on C-level skills. Otherwise, you will just naturally stay at the level you achieve from normal methods of learning (input, some grammar work, etc).\n\nhttps://www.laits.utexas.edu/fi/sites/laits.utexas.edu.fi/files/Self%20Assessment%20Checklist%20European.pdf", "created_utc": "1651148635.0", "edited": "False", "id": "i6iwukt", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_udpyni", "parent_id": "t3_udpyni", "score": "31", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "Luguaedos", "body": "If something is important enough to post a question about, it should be important enough to explain what you did to get it working.", "created_utc": "1651097431.0", "edited": "False", "id": "i6gilow", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_ilb0r9", "parent_id": "t1_g3sql4v", "score": "2", "subreddit": "Anki", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s9lm"}, {"author": "Luguaedos", "body": ">Does anyone in 2022 really want to know what \u201cjake\u201d meant in 1925?\n\nWell now I do....", "created_utc": "1651070421.0", "edited": "False", "id": "i6emgyf", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_ucsmf3", "parent_id": "t1_i6d2u9q", "score": "7", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "Luguaedos", "body": "I came to say the same. \"Native speaker\" is not a homogenous group of people all of the same age all having the same background all of the same gender, etc. Native speakers of different languages can belong to multiple sub-cultures and will have different socio-economic and educational backgrounds.", "created_utc": "1650927460.0", "edited": "False", "id": "i66z8ex", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_ubupch", "parent_id": "t1_i66p0w7", "score": "11", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "Luguaedos", "body": "That would be good for the soil as well.", "created_utc": "1650914432.0", "edited": "False", "id": "i6635ei", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_ub9kml", "parent_id": "t1_i65sj65", "score": "3", "subreddit": "Home", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qs0k"}, {"author": "Luguaedos", "body": "You can also grow different types of edible mushrooms.

I started seriously learning Irish when I spoke Portuguese. Initially, when I was trying to talk in Irish, Portuguese would come to me but this stopped very quickly and I think it was just because I was getting used to a new foreign language. Like I mentioned before, I think my brain was categorizing things as English and not English. But due to the clear differences between Irish and Portuguese, it separated them quickly. When I was flirting with Swedish, I had no such interference and I was even learning Swedish through Italian. And learning Chinese now, (I am trying to get HSK 4 this year or early next year), I feel no direct interference from any of my other languages. I'm sure there will be some on a certain level but it is not like in the Romance languages where I will be having a conversation in Portuguese and just use an Italian verb conjugated with Portuguese grammar or say /s\u025brv\u025blu/ (a PT pronunciation of cervello) instead of c\u00e9rebro. And that has happened to me while speaking Portuguese. The horrible thing is, I know consciously it is not correct but it still doesn't trigger a \"that's not right\" automatic response in me when I say it... \n\nBut just to be clear, these are fairly rare considering how often I use the languages.

Often humans are very bad at evaluating the how effective a learning technique is. There is at least one study that has been done where students were asked to answer questions before being taught the material. They obviously got the answers wrong. A few days later, after being taught the material, they were tested and their scores were over 10% higher on average than the control group who were not asked questions before being taught.\n\nThis group actually evaluated the process of being asked questions before they could answer them correctly as a worse technique than the \"normal method\" even though they were told that their group scored higher than the control. I am skeptical of anyone who says structured learning \"doesn't work\" as much as I am of people who say it is essential.\n\nEvery single person who is successful in their language learning will have spent many more hours consuming media in their target language than they ever did with their ass in a chair studying it. But what is worse is that you cannot possibly know what was going on in the mind of person X as compared to person Y as they consumed that media. Person X was completely focused and involved, paying attention to every word and thinking about the show and what was said days after having watched it. Person Y enjoyed and would certainly say they paid attention but didn't really think about the nuances or quote the show and pretty much forgot most of what was said when it finished.\n\nI have a Brazilian friend who only ever studied English formally in school and has never spent any significant time in an English speaking country yet he would pass for a native speaker of American English. This is absolutely because from 14 to the age of 20 he consumed American TV and movies like they were air. English is always on the TV in the background when he is not working. He can quote movies to me and even paraphrase full skits of Saturday Night Live. He is also a professional chess coach who spends hours a day interacting with English speaking students. It took him 10s of thousands of hours to get his English to where it is today in his 30s. 10s of thousands of hours of watching, rewatching, and rewatching things until he learned parts of some of them by heart just through repetition. It was fun for him. But it was effortful. He's intentionally rewatch these things, the things he liked or thought were funny or were challenging for him.\n\nEffort, fun, and enjoyment are NOT the same things. [A thing can be effortful and you can enjoy it without it being fun](https://theoatmeal.com/comics/unhappy). You have to expend effort.

So the idea of \"visiting\" a country as being the best or most common way to interact with a language is simply untrue. I live in the US and my native language is English. I have never been to Italy, I have a C1 CILS certification, and I am currently working on the C2. I read literature in Italian, I listen to the news in Italian, I talk to Italians in Italian more often than I talk to my own mother.\n\nConsider this: there are two fundamental types of goals.\n\nTerminal goals: something that you want simply because you want it.\n\nInstrumental goals: something that you want to help you achieve another goal. \n\nFor example: you want a good job so as to earn money so as to retire early so as to live a comfortable life after 50. When you stop saying \"so as to...\" you have reached a terminal goal.\n\nItalian for me is a terminal goal. And it sounds like it might be for you as well. I absolutely picked Italian but it feels like Italian picked me. This, in my opinion, is the best kind of motivation that you can have for anything. It's not because your partner is Italian. It's not because you like Italian detective novels. It is simply a part of you. And to be clear, it did not start out that way for me. I just picked Italian at random and ended up falling for it. If I had picked French or whatever, I would have fallen for it too. I'm pretty certain of that.\n\nI believe very firmly that unless you have a very compelling *terminal* reason to learn a language as an *instrumental* goal (meaning it is in service of achieving a very important terminal goal), then learning a language as an instrumental goal is likely to yield poor results or simply fail. This depends on how you define fail, though. You need to learn Spanish to level X for your school. Fine. You are unlikely to go beyond that point unless you have a strong reason for doing so.\n\nIf you are open-minded and curious, nearly anything can become a terminal goal for you. Whichever one you pick, you should learn to love it for its own sake and make speaking it a part of your identity. At a certain point you are not a Spanish learner, you are a Spanish speaker. \n\nTL;DR: pick the one that you feel you are more likely to integrate into your identity. Your concept of self will drive your habits more effectively than any other motivating factor and forget about \"usefulness\".

Using speechling with long, advanced sentences from magazines and books I have learned that when I speak, the quality of certain vowels in connected speech will color certain vowels that precede or follow. For example if /i/ follows or precedes /e/ in an unstressed syllable, then my /e/ will tend toward /i/. Yes, just knowing I am going to say an /i/ will influence how I pronounce /e/ at times! So now I am working hard on making sure that my vowels are pure. But long, complex sentences that really test my speech combined with someone willing to pick apart my pronunciation has been amazing. This makes sense to me from back when I did power lifting. If you want to know where you are weak in a lift, work close to your one rep max and have someone observe where your form begins to break down.

I believe that it will mostly be applicable across any part of the general tech field from dev to sec to ops to whatever.\n\nCertifications may well get you past automated HR systems especially [if those are listed in the job description](https://www.wired.com/story/job-applicants-hack-resume-reading-software/). And if a job requires the cert, it is obviously useful...\n\nAs a hiring manager, I do not care about certifications unless I understand why the person chose to get the certs. For someone starting off in the field, I want to hear things like using the certification's \"curriculum\" as a way to improve their learning and ensure they did not have obvious gaps in their studies and learning as well as using the exam to validate what they have learned. For experienced people, I want to hear similar reasoning: validating their experience and filling in any holes they might have. If all the person cares about is finding a job, I do not care if they have the cert or not as it doesn't show a desire to learn and understand what they have learned. I don't just want to see a desire to learn, I want to see awareness of meta-learning and I want to see that they were doing hands on work. Not just reading and self-testing.\n\nIn my experience working in both development and operations, the knowledge I got from studying for certifications has been very helpful. I believe that this is because of the breadth of knowledge that I gained from building and breaking things while learning. While I studied, if I did not fully understand a test scenario I built it to the best of my ability and then created the conditions to duplicate the problem and worked through resolving it. In dev, if I did not understand the concept, I built a small but useful application that used the concept and then tried to break it by applying it in ways it was not necessarily intended to be used.\n\nA cert [just for having the letters](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Cjg4a2QWYAAxtDu.jpg) is of limited professional use. You will simply forget most of what you learned to obtain it. A cert used as a method to validate and push your learning by forcing you to do things you would not normally do in your day-to-day job is extremely helpful. I believe this kind of learning is why people in other departments will frequently ask me for help when things are broken even if I do not know the code base or have base-knowledge of the product. When everything is easy and working as it should, most of this knowledge is useless. It's why people will say, \"You are never going to use that in the real world.\" And that is fine until everything is broken. And that is, I think, where cert knowledge (if learned properly) is useful. Because if everyday knowledge could solve the problem, it wouldn't have become a problem. And, obviously, I'm not trying to say a cert is the only or the best way to get that kind of knowledge.

They evolved from a common ancestor, [Proto-Romance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proto-Romance_language), that had already lost some cases and had developed a number of grammatical innovations like using the infinitive+habere (habeo) to form the future tense (at least in Western Romance, if not Proto-Romance) that eventually came to be considered a simple tense. So you have shared constructions like\n\nItalian: *amer\u00f3, amerai*, etc from amar+ho, amar+hai, etc\n\nPortuguese: *amarei, amaras*, etc from *amar+hei*, *amar+has*, etc\n\nFrench: J'aimerai, tu aimeras, etc. from aimer+ai, amar+as, etc.\n\nObviously some of the modern languages have lost this or in their colloquial forms tend to favor other constructions like PT *Eu vou amar*... \n\nSince u/ChungsGhost mentioned the Balkan sprachbund, I will also point out that some of common grammatical features that we see in the modern Romance languages developed in the [SAE sprachbund](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Average_European) and are not ancestral to Latin or even Proto-Romance (definite articles, for example). Sardinian uses a definite article derived from *ipse*, for example, which is also used in Balearic Catalan and was once common in Gascon, if I remember correctly. \n\nWhat I would suggest is that if you are interested in the Romance languages, continue. Especially the Italo-Western Romance languages will have their own internal consistency. That's why they are grouped that way. If you are interested in Latin, then Italian is an obvious choice for the history of the city of Rome and the Empire. If you want to travel to see the most famous archaeological sites associated with the Empire, then Italian should be on your short list.\n\nIf you are not especially inclined to learn the Romance languages, then, u/ChungsGhost has some good advice, I think.

When it comes down to it, I do not think in terms of obviously good and obviously evil. I instead think, \"How would I judge myself if I did these things? Would I be friends with this person?\" And it comes right down to it, with Kelsier in the Final Empire, I don't know. The situation in the Final Empire is so extreme that extremism can be justified.

Murdering nobles simply for being nobles regardless of any factor other than that. Becoming frustrated with people on his crew for questioning his murderous rampages. Turning himself into a god (twice). Running multiple criminal organizations, one of which clearly assassinates people on other worlds to advance his agenda. His use of hemalurgy. Granted we do not really know much in that regard. But from what we do know, I see Kelsier giving exactly zero F's about spiking someone he thought was inconvenient or didn't matter in some way or who was just in his way. 70 years old and you're some kind of misting? How about you help the Sovereign out with these bands?\n\nOne thing that we have to keep in mind is that psychopathy is not a neat binary. It is a spectrum. And the fact that Kelsier had a strong romantic relationship in the past doesn't mean he doesn't fit many of the other traits like grandiosity, impulsivity, criminal activity. All of his charity and good will for the skaa, though certainly genuine, clearly play into his Savior Complex. And I would argue that if he did not have a Savior Complex he would feel the desire for that charity far less, to the point where he would not act on it. And I base that on Marsh's assessment of Kelsier before TFE.\n\nIf nothing else, Kelsier would score really high on overt anti-social features and psychopathic interpersonal traits.

Contrast that with Castilian and Basque that have been in contact for a thousand years. Then, add on top of that the fact that the distribution of /\u03b8/ is not consistent in Spain with some regions having \\[s\\] or \\[s\u0304\\]. If not all varieties of Spanish in Spain have acquired the sound, it should not really surprise anyone that Catalan has not. It is also possible that there is a strong tendency to see /\u03b8/ as a distinctly Spanish sound and for native speakers of Catalan to resist that particular phoneme on the basis of linguistic identity. Influence is a human-centric social process, not an inevitable natural law. So you have to consider that their could be socio-linguistic factors that limit what types of linguistic influences are acceptable to speakers across time. I guess what I am trying to say is that if /\u03b8/ is not present in Catalan, it is because it neither evolved naturally nor did native speakers chose to imitate Spanish in that way. Why they made that choice is probably very complex and may not be clearly discernible as the reasons for it may have changed over time and from region to region and it should not be assumed that such a change would happen. \n\nFor example, 500 years ago there may have been border regions with Aragonese where this sound existed natively in Catalan, assuming it was present in Aragonese at the time... But then the spread of Castilian might have caused a backlash where people who spoke Catalan in those regions began to imitate the speakers of Barcelona, perhaps because their speech was considered more \"authentic\". This would have halted the spread of the phoneme and even favored its extinction. All speculation, of course, my point is just to show how complicated this is and that the borrowing of /\u03b8/ is not inevitable.", "created_utc": "1643981988.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hvk5dgr", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_sjwsyh", "parent_id": "t1_hvjiizp", "score": "4", "subreddit": "catalan", "subreddit_id": "t5_2tjlk"}, {"author": "Luguaedos", "body": "Thanks, but I also don't want to just minimize what you are saying. Kids DO have advantages over us. But I want to point out that in comparing a child acquiring their native languages (even if it's a heritage language and their national language) we are comparing apples and oranges. Now, if we look at, say, a 10 yo kid who has started learning a foreign language (so not in country) and a motivated adult doing the same, I think the advantage all goes to the adult if all other things are equal. Now, an adult with an infant and another small child, that's not a valid comparison, as that person has a barely functional, sleep-deprived brain in their head that is almost 100% allocated to keeping those kids from accidentally committing suicide or dying in some other way. A child learning a foreign language is dependent on their environment and has to look to the adults in their life to alter that environment for them. An adult, assuming they are not severely limited by some adult obligations, has the means (executive control, access to funds, etc) to drastically alter their environment for themselves to help their learning. And that is huge.\n\nAs an adult learner I can decide to switch my online subscriptions around so that I can watch TV in my target languages. I can decide to put money aside to buy books and other things. I decide when it is time to change tutors. But most importantly, as an adult, I have enough experience to know that I need to sit and think about what I am doing, how I am doing it, and how I can do it better. Kids, and I'm not talking about teens above the age of around 15, generally do not have the capacity to do meta-learning without the direction of an adult. I don't believe there is any advantage stronger than this: the ability to evaluate your learning habits and processes and attempt to improve them through experimentation and observation. Children pretty much are stuck in the perspective of \"I like this activity\" or \"I don't like that activity.\" An adult properly using an adult brain has no such limitation and understands that \"like\" and \"dislike\" are mutable and context dependent.", "created_utc": "1643979059.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hvjzr3j", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_sjaiw5", "parent_id": "t1_hvink5t", "score": "3", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "Luguaedos", "body": "Fenton!

Once it got to the point that I was spending more time creating and reviewing cards than I was spending on actually interacting with the language itself, I stopped and reevaluated my strategy. I started over with a brand new deck and slowly started to move things from the old deck into the new one as I added cards. \n\n1. I focus mostly on sentence cards. For sentence cards I use things from media that I have consumed. Audio with an image (when possible).\n2. The card must be from something that I enjoyed. Book, TV, a conversation I had, etc.\n3. The card must only test a single unit. One word, a set phrase, or a clear grammatical construction.\n4. Anything that I moved from the old deck to the new deck needed to be something I stumbled across in consuming media or in conversations that I had forgotten or could not remember clearly.\n5. Since my focus was on quality in my cards (the cards have to be interesting) I frequently had to add things like audio to the old cards I moved into the new deck. All cards must be cards I am willing to engage with for 3+ years.\n6. I set my parameters in Anki so that I see a card more frequently in the first week of learning it and after that the interval is quite high. This keeps reviews down in the long term.\n7. I use the review simulator add on every couple months to decide how many new cards I am going to allow myself to add.\n8. I decide how I am going to use Anki. I decide what is important to remember. I decide what I find interesting and what to engage with.\n\nHere is [an example of one of my cards](https://i.imgur.com/JJ6NoK6.png). In addition to the text and the image, once you enter the answer you will hear the audio from the show the card is taken from. I spend a lot of time working on my cards. They are super personal and therefore enjoyable.\n\nIMO, the thing that makes Anki suck is\n\n* Using pre-made decks long-term other than as a way to get up to speed on something. For example, they are fine for learning the first 1000 words. Then they need to be ditched. Make your own deck for long-term retention.\n* Not using sentence cards enough. Single words are boring. Keep single word cards to a minimum. Concrete nouns are the only things that get single word cards in my deck.\n* Letting Anki drive  what you learn rather than using Anki to review what you have already learned. With the exception of cases like in my first point about the first 1000 words or something similar, you need to be in control of what you are reviewing not some other person who made a deck. Sentences from *your* books, from *your* shows, from *your* conversations, from *your* interaction with the language need to go into *your* deck.

Some of them may have understood, been able to read or even write and speak it, but if you are picking a language based on your family heritage, you should understand that Standard German, i.e. *Standardhochdeutsch*, is different from Swiss Standard German (*Schriftdeutsch*) which is still different from the spoken varieties. And when I say the spoken varieties are different from Standard German I mean [very different](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfX1OFMXUh4).\n\nI bring this up because my family is from what is now where Switzerland and Germany share a border and lives in the midwest of the US now and I have had this same discussion with my own family members and I think it is important and needs to be considered. In my discussion with my cousin I said imagine spending 4 years getting really good at German, taking a trip to the region where our family is from and [not being able to understand anyone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89adaKKIkUw) (see the top comment on that video) there who was speaking their native language to you.

IMO the two points that you mention are really emergent properties of those other more general issues. The real problems with learning two foreign languages as a self-directed learner from scratch and at the same time are these\n\n1. **Time management.** For adults, based on your message I am making that assumption, who have other responsibilities managing your time can be exceptionally difficult with just a single language.\n2. **You only have a vague idea of what you are doing.** Sure, you read the wiki, you got lots of advice, you have watched all the advice from people on YouTube, but that is all theory. In addition to learning two new languages you need to develop the required habits and systems that you will need to be successful. When you are learning your first foreign language as a self-directed learner, you are also learning how to learn a language. In essence you are already learning two new skills.\n3. **More chances for failure and less time to think about why** \\- which can lead to burnout. I don't mean failure to learn the language, I am just talking about failing in a general sense. Maybe you cannot keep up with the learning schedule you have decided to follow. Certain aspects of the X are much harder than you anticipated. Whatever. But the fact is that as a new learner, you will hit some big bumps. And if you are learning two languages at once, you will hit them more frequently. Not feeling like you are making progress will tank any motivation that you may have. And since you are learning two languages at once you may not feel like you can take a week out of your schedule to really think about and consider what it is that is going wrong and how you can improve it. Which will lead to more frustration.\n\nIMO, if you are naturally very organized and focused, do the hard thing first. Learn Arabic. But do NOT put additional roadblock in your path by attempting to learn both on your own. If you are organized and have a group of people who you can talk with deeply, bounce ideas off of, and get support from on a regular basis, maybe you could do 2 at once. But why bother?\n\nIf you tend to be not well organized, you have a diagnosis of ADHD or suspect that you have it, don't even consider two languages at once. Learning how to manage yourself and organize your learning process is going to be enough additional work. Start with Spanish. Strive to learn things about yourself as you go that you can then use to help yourself with Arabic. Meta-learning, habit forming, and time management are all skills that you can develop. Give yourself the time that you will need to develop those skills while you are learning. It will be far harder to do that while you are learning a difficult language.\n\nRemember, the FSI stuff is all based around a class room environment with professionals and curricula crafted to help people learn.

Notice that when working with the large piece his hand is almost never directly on the part of the obsidian being detached. When it is, he is using the palm of his hand to apply pressure to the back of the piece so that the energy dissipates. The same is true for setting it on the thigh. This dissipates the energy and helps the flake fan out. Once the piece is small, I do not usually wear gloves because I personally need to be able to feel the ridges on the ground-facing side (where the flake is detached). You will get small cuts but they don't hurt.  A lot of people will say that the fact is that a piece of obsidian that large, if held and struck incorrectly, could take a finger off gloves or no gloves. \n\nBut I am going to say this to be clear: if anyone wants to get into the hobby when you are working with large pieces of flint, obsidian, or whatever: use gloves. A finger removing situation like that is unlikely to ever occur but a glove could still mean the difference between getting some stitches and having a tendon reattached. The risk to reward ratio is just way too imbalanced. Do not let the worst-case unlikely to every happen to you scenario lead you to believe it doesn't matter when there are many more likely to occur situations where gloves will protect you even if only a little.\n\nThe most common injuries that you see in the hobby for people wearing protective equipment are small [flakes in the eye that bounce off of something and enter behind glasses](https://www.reddit.com/r/knapping/comments/rqs1zo/little_sucker_bounced_off_my_cheek_and_under_my/) or injuries from improperly using the tools themselves.

Consider these two statements: Studying today will not make you fluent in Chinese tomorrow. Not studying today will not prevent you from becoming fluent in 5 years.\n\nSo what's the point? If you are focusing on a big 5-year or even decade long \"dream\", each individual thing you have to do is insignificant to achieve that dream. So you end up getting by on pure enjoyment. And you better enjoy it or you will not do it. And you cannot enjoy it all the time so there are going to be times when you just don't. Because any single action is pointless.\n\nHow do you get past that? Have you tried breaking down your dream into much smaller targets that you can accomplish in a period of months? And then break those down further into the actions that you need to take weekly and daily to achieve those smaller chunks? This is reframing your broader \"dream\" into challenging but clearly scoped that, while necessary for accomplishing the dream, distract you from the 5 to 10 year path by forcing you to focus on the next 90 days or 6 months. When your timeframe is 90 days, almost every action you take is crucial and therefore nothing is pointless.\n\n>But yet during the day, i feel determined and have enough energy/attention span to study 7-8 hours\n\nAnyone can do stuff like that for a period of weeks. But it's almost certainly impossible to maintain that level of effort indefinitely. Hit your objectives hard for short periods of time, but absolutely plan breaks into what you are doing. Relying on that kind of effort to accomplish big goals will get you stuck in a cycle of boom and bust that will make your efforts super inefficient over longer periods of time.", "created_utc": "1640542550.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hq1ss4n", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_rp1pmq", "parent_id": "t3_rp1pmq", "score": "2", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "Luguaedos", "body": "Hello, u/17roofge, and thank you for posting on r/languagelearning.

Keep in mind that someone using a study resource that has B1 on the front of it is likely functionally A2 studying to become B1. They are studying at an intermediate level, but they are not at the intermediate level. CEFR doesn't use terms like intermediate or elementary, though... I consider people studying at the B1 (but close to B2)/B2/C1(but still close to B2) levels to be intermediate learners.\n\nSo, for people studying at the B2/C1 level anything of interest is going to be appropriate including movies that make heavy use of dialectal language (use subtitles). I think the sooner you get used to that the better especially when it comes too heavy Roman accents and the use of romanesco in general. That in particular is just too prevalent in media to try to avoid it for very long if you are a serious learner.\n\nAnything on Netflix will have subtitles. Use them as an aid but keep in mind that if you are expecting a 1-1 correspondence even with standard language, you are going to be disappointed. This is actually a good thing.

If you are not easily able to understand most of what is being said in your target language it is unlikely that you have heard/read the structures that you will need to converse enough numbers of times to have properly assimilated them into a usable repertoire in your own speech. Remember, the more you have to invent, the greater chance you have of just being wrong about how to say things. I don't believe that is necessarily bad. But I do believe there is a certain point where most of your focused learning time should be spent on consuming media because you will simply derive more benefit from hearing natives speaking idiomatically than what you will derive from getting corrections of your non-idiomatic speech. \n\n>And we normally speak anywhere from 1 to 2.5 hours about anything. Normally we just randomly switch between languages as well, so we don\u2019t make any rules about what to use. I\u2019m starting to\u200f\u200f\u200e\u200f\u200f\u200e\u200f\u200f\u200e\u200f\u200f\u200e\u00adthink that this is a slow way of doing things though\n\nIMO, you are doing fine right now. You should be leveraging input from native material to lay the foundation for how to speak. Without this anything over a couple hours a week of speaking practice will will only start to yield less benefit for the amount of effort put in. \n\nI would suggest that you first try to increase your passive input a lot for the next 4 months as see what sort of input that has on your speaking skills. If you are already doing an hour or so of active listening every day, try to double that in passive listening. You don't have to reach that goal every single day but you should try your best. \n\nThe way that I see this is the following:\n\nA levels: You understand little of material intended for natives. Almost all learning should be focused on active input where you focus attention on trying to understand.\n\nB1 level: You get the gist of most things for natives. Most of your learning should be focused on trying to understand. More emphasis should be put on trying to understand more diverse types of media from podcasts to TV. \n\nB2 level:  Native media on topics you are familiar with should be understood, not just the gist. Most of your learning should be focused on trying to understand but the amount of time you dedicate to output should increase. Passive listening should become a major part of your learning strategy and should increase to the limit possible for your lifestyle.\n\nC levels: You easily understand nearly everything in most major accents. Most of your active learning time should be dedicated to output. This can still include input but it should change from I am going to watch this show and try to understand as much as possible to I am going to breakdown how this person talks and learn to speak that way myself. At this level you should have very little time for consuming any media in your native language if you are actively working on improving.", "created_utc": "1639497984.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hoiw7xl", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_rg3lox", "parent_id": "t3_rg3lox", "score": "2", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "Luguaedos", "body": "Hello, u/Renard_Cachee_Sage.

I would go a little further and say MOST of the mistakes that learners make, not just beginners, are due to a lack of input via listening. And the best way to correct those mistakes is to get exposure to the language via listening and actually paying attention. While input is not useless when you are not paying close attention, neither is it the most effective. A couple hours a week of speaking practice where you are fumbling your words should be completely overwhelmed by \\~7 hours of active listening and some reading. And you should, IMO, add on top of that time doing passive re-listening of material that you used in active listening previously.\n\nEspecially when it comes to sociability, we are all very different. But I think that most people really enjoy interacting with others and making friends. And a language is an interest that you can share with someone to build a friendship. A self-directed learner should not be looking at speaking from an early point as a way to improve their language skills. The benefits that we should be getting from that are the following:\n\n1. Building relationships with other people to help us maintain our motivation. People join chess clubs or pickup soccer teams or go to the local comic store to play Catan or whatever for a sense of community and to make friends centered around an interest. Tutoring and language exchanges should be approached in the same way.\n2. Get used to making a fool of yourself. IMO, it's not a question of confidence at this point, it is a question of being comfortable with making mistakes. I do not care what anyone says no matter how well you speak a foreign language at some point you are going to get into a situation where you look like a moron linguistically. *I know this to be a fact because each and everyone of us has done it in our NATIVE languages.* And if you think you have not, I have news for you, you are just oblivious to it. So unless you want to extend your silent period until you are well into C1 territory, just get used to it now. And if you are not testing your mental models of the language against those of native speakers, how would you even know? Just stop worrying about being perfect and trust in the fact that you can get enough active input that any mistakes you make will be corrected by the process and any serious issues that are not can be corrected by you through focused effort. I have never met a learner in real life that could not conquer mistakes that they made via concerted effort unless those issues were due to some sort of limitation like a speech impediment.\n\nNow, that is not to say that all learners will achieve native like accents or even be able to achieve native like fluency in a language. We all have different goals, circumstances, and resources (time and money) and all of those things play a part. But you will NEVER reach a point where you objectively cannot improve. You may get to a point where it becomes practically undesirable for you to improve, though. You can reach a level where further improvement requires more time and/or effort than you are willing to invest. And that is fine. This is where fossilization becomes a problem, IMO, because many people who reach this point do not recognize it. They are at a high B2 and perhaps they don't know that they need to change strategies because the things that they have been doing up to that point have stopped working. Or maybe they are a firm C1 but making that next step up is just too difficult given their other commitments but they keep trying any way. I have been in that situation with Italian before. Work was crazy and I could not invest the effort into organizing myself as I really should have but I kept going until I just got burnt out. That lasted almost a year for me. Wanting to improve is easy.

Proven\u00e7al, however, is listed as threatened. But I don't see a way to look at the demographics. If 200K of the 250K native speakers of Gascon are over the age of 40, though, I would consider that a very bad sign indeed. But I will admit I could be very, very wrong in considering the language moribund.\n\nIf you have any demographic information about the age of the native speakers saying that 50% or more are under the age of 35, then I would be really excited. If more than 80% are 40+, though. It would just make me sad regardless of the appropriate label.\n\nDo you know if there is any media? Contemporary fiction, TV, etc in Gascon or one of the other varieties?", "created_utc": "1637069768.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hkunnxm", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_4kxg3u", "parent_id": "t1_hkujuh2", "score": "1", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "Luguaedos", "body": "Some folks have given you good advice here and I want to emphasize that the use of graded readers as well as audio/video sources that have transcripts including audio/video that are intended for native speakers should be a critical aspect of your learning and you should de-emphasize apps. Engage with the language on its own terms as much as possible from the beginning. Do not stick only to learners resources and absolutely do not stick to mostly app-based learning. Your objective is to be able to understand, read, write, and speak. Your objective is not to be able to play matching games or rearrange words that have all been chosen for you into a sentence.\n\nAll that being said, something that no one asked you is how much time per day on average you are dedicating to learning. If you are able to commit to one hour per day, then I would agree with what others have said here about A2 being easily achievable with the correct resources. I would even argue it is too easy and you should shoot for being having completed the A2 material and should be 1/2 way through the B1level.\n\nNow, I find this quote interesting:\n\n>I\u2019ve been studying Italian on my own since last December. I\u2019ve dipped in and out of various apps, websites, and books, but don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m getting anywhere.\n\nThis tells me that there is a problem with your approach to the language. You are not able to stay sufficiently focused and you lose motivation. Why? Here are some reasons that I have experienced.\n\n1. You are using material that, while it may be more interesting than \"traditional\" language course resources, is still ultimately boring after more than a few weeks.\n2. Your learning plan is not well organized and since you are not seeing decent results you are not getting into a feedback loop of clear improvements or accomplishments driving your identity as a *speaker* of the language which in turn makes you want to improve even more. Instead, you feel like you are not learning much so what you do on a daily basis doesn't really matter so sometimes you just skip it. After a while you realize that you have not done anything thing for a week or more...\n\nSelf-learners need a path to follow. You cannot just go at it scattershot and expect to make clear progress forever. I suggest that you take a look at [this PDF](https://www.laits.utexas.edu/fi/sites/laits.utexas.edu.fi/files/Self%20Assessment%20Checklist%20European.pdf) and you go through it for the A1 and A2 levels. If you do not have a language partner that can help you with it, find one. If you are too nervous to engage a native speaker, I have a C1 CILS cert and my competence is somewhere between high C1 and low C2 (from an exam perspective). I am more than willing to help you in the A levels. I don't feel I would be competent at any other level, though. If you PM me, I will also help you with resources. But there are a ton of things you can just find online especially on YouTube. \n\nu/IAmGilGunderson had some particularly good advice. I fully advocate for learners using Anki, especially through B2. IMO, it should just be an integral part of your learning experience forever but that's just me. Lots of people become slaves to Anki which I think is foolish. My Italian cards for Anki take me less than a few minutes per day and I spend all the rest of my time with Italian reading, listening to podcasts, etc. I did not learn Italian to do Anki, right? I use Anki to help me stay sharp since I do not live in country.\n\nThe only apps I recommend: LingQ (all levels) and Speechling (once you start to feel comfortable speaking). \n\nFinal tip: schedule a mock A2 exam with someone after you go through that check list. Again, I am willing to help you with this and for free. But it would be best to find a native speaker on iTalki or something. I did exactly this many times as I was preparing for the C level exams. Set it for an ambitious date. If you feel super confident, set it for 3 months. Absolutely not more than 5, though, given your past experience with the language. This will help give you very specific objectives to focus on. Creating a commitment to taking the exam with someone else, even a mock exam, should be enough to keep you motivated for 3 to 5 months.", "created_utc": "1637067619.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hkujn5j", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_qunq1w", "parent_id": "t3_qunq1w", "score": "3", "subreddit": "italianlearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2tuxf"}, {"author": "Luguaedos", "body": "I edited that to be more vague.", "created_utc": "1637010976.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hkrpbe6", "is_submitter": "True", "link_id": "t3_quqfy5", "parent_id": "t1_hkrosye", "score": "3", "subreddit": "Mistborn", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s9ue"}, {"author": "Luguaedos", "body": "Hello, u/Jolly_Jello_3087, and thank you for posting on r/languagelearning.

I've never studied for this exam and, besides, language learning is probably the one \"academic endeavor\" I've ever truly embraced.\n\nSince I have been summoned (thanks, u/JS1755), I'll give my opinion as well. You absolutely should prepare for the exam. Don't take it on whim. Even if you were 100% confident of your level, I would suggest at least 90 days of prep at around 3 hours per week. You won't even be able to book the one this November as the deadline has passed, I am sure.\n\nRegarding your concerns about doing badly, you are taking the wrong attitude . A CEFR exam, when you are approaching it for the reasons that you are approaching it, should be seen as a method for expanding your linguistic skills systematically and then validating those skills while simultaneously providing you with feedback to show you where your skills are weakest. \n\nA failed CEFR exam is not a denunciation of you are a learner, a speaker, or a human being. Even a failed exam can teach you something about your skills and your learning habits. But it doesn't determine your value and it doesn't invalidate the work you put in.\n\nIf you make your preparation about mastering the skills that are tested rather than worrying about getting a passing score, not matter what your results are, you have spent your time well. Learning how to write in a clear and articulate manner, learning how to describe things clearly and in good idiomatic Italian feels amazing. And I achieved that because I used the exam objectives to guide my learning and I used practice exams on iTalki with tutors to help me validate my skills. I came out of the experience knowing that I could discuss nearly anything in Italian because I had done it. And that is the value of preparing for the exams.\n\nIf you want to take the B2, IMO, you should start with B1 practice exams to see where you stand. It might even be a good idea to do a few A2 exams as well to help you build your confidence. \n\nOne last thing, I would not expect that 500 hours combined is good enough to achieve a B2. I would strive to push to 500 hours of just consuming *native* content. TV, audiobooks, movies, podcasts, etc, but only material intended for natives. So Podcast Italiano doesn't really count. Productive skills like speaking and writing are the lagging indicators of your overall ability. So a person who is a clear B2 in writing and speaking will have at a minimum C1 level listening and reading skills. Keep in mind this is a spectrum. A really solid B2 is likely a low C1.", "created_utc": "1636503302.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hk06wtb", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_qqfspm", "parent_id": "t3_qqfspm", "score": "12", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "Luguaedos", "body": "I have removed that post as well.

I am American and when I speak Portuguese I call myself estadunidense or americano depending on context. In Italian, though, I almost exclusively use americano. It is a matter of usage in the language I am speaking. A transgender woman is an individual and should be able to determine for herself how she is called. But the people of a nation are not a single individual and will thus have multiple opinions about how they should be called *in other languages*. I find neither of those terms offensive.  If a Spanish or Portuguese speaker insisted on referring to me and other citizens of the United States as gringos, however, I would find that offensive. \n\nFurthermore what you suggest only works with closely related languages adn event hen only sometimes. A person from Britain may wish to be called British in English but in Chinese they are \u82f1\u56fd\u4eba. Which in no way even remotely sounds like \"British\". Is that \"wrong\" in the same way that misgendering someone is wrong? I don't believe any reasonable person would argue that. \n\n>For the same reason a transgender woman wants to be called a \u201cshe\u201d\n\nThe reason you don't intentionally misgender people is because it is offensive to them. Calling an American *estadunidense* in Portuguese is not offensive. It is just one of several terms that can be used for the same nationality in Portuguese. Calling a British person \u82f1\u56fd\u4eba (y\u012bnggu\u00f3 r\u00e9n) in Chinese rather than something phonetically closer to \"British\" is not offensive to a British person. Nor is referring to a German as German in English rather than deutsch. \n\nIf a language's demonym for another nationality or ethnic group is derived from a  term with offensive, colonial, or some other problematic connotations, I am all for changing the  demonym. But I have never met an American, myself included, who thinks that *estadunidense* is offensive. And if I did, I would roll my eyes all them the same way I do at the Brazilians I have met who try to insist that anyone who lives in the Americas can be called \"americano\" because never in their lives have they ever identified with the continental plate that they were born on in that way except to try to make that point.", "created_utc": "1635176133.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hhzvb0b", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_qewt8t", "parent_id": "t1_hhzisap", "score": "5", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "Luguaedos", "body": "Pretty much the same.

Your second priority should be increasing your vocabulary via reading and other methods of participating in the language. I would also suggest using something like Anki to assist with this. You are already well on your way with steps one and two below. I think step three may be key for you.\n\n1. Audiobooks and their print version should be the only books you read unless it is for academic or professional purposes and there is no French version of the book. If it is for enjoyment, read only in French for the next 9 months or so. The same is true with magazine and any blogs. \n2. TV shows and any audio/video media that you consume should be in French. You're well on your way here.\n3. Find a way to try and live some aspects of your life through French. Learn a new skill via French. Have you always wanted to learn the guitar? Find an online tutor in France. Have you always wanted to learn to program? Find online courses in French. Have you always wanted to learn to draw? Find online courses in French. The best result will be something that requires human interaction. But it's not 100% necessary. I have done nearly every MOOC that exists in Italian. Get on Coursera and EdX and see if there are courses that are natively in French. Not French learning, but something like the history of cinema or the history of philosophy or whatever. I even did a course on the history of architecture in Italian, I have exactly 0 interest in that topic. Here is one university: [https://www.edx.org/school/sorbonnex](https://www.edx.org/school/sorbonnex) IMO, this is really key because it will set up your identity as a French speaker, not a french learner. You are not doing a French course because you are learning French. You are doing a course in French because you are a French speaker. And that's what French speakers would do.\n\nOnce you have that routine really underway, start working on the oral part of the CEFR exams for French. Figure out which one is the most prestigious and prepare for the test. Even if you are never going to take it. Do role plays from the exams. You are in Paris and you got robbed, your language partner or tutor is the police officer. You have to describe the person, explain what happened, go through the process, etc. Do an interview for a job in a field you know almost nothing about! OMG, that is the stuff of nightmares and I hated doing that but I did it.\n\n u/Swalapala had some excellent suggestions. To build on those I would also suggest that you take [this list of *Table Topics*](http://publicspeakingwisdom.com/uploads/9/3/8/8/9388134/100s_of_table_topics_questions.pdf) print them, cut them into strips, and then put them in a bag or cup or something. At least three times a week, grab a piece of paper for notes and a pen, set a timer to 3 minutes, pull out one of those strips of paper, and do that talk in French out loud to no one but yourself. Any place you stumble, any word or expression that you do not know, take note of it after the 3 minutes is up. Then figure out what you should have said (I suggest working with a native speaker on this part) and try to give the talk again at some point even if it is just to yourself again.", "created_utc": "1634081450.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hgf233t", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_q5z0en", "parent_id": "t3_q5z0en", "score": "3", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "Luguaedos", "body": "Hello, u/pitronix.

We are talking very different timeframes if you are consuming 3 to 5 hours of Spanish media per day than if you are consuming only one hour.\n\nMy magic number is around the 800 hour mark for a first Romance languages to be able to understand most of what you hear. Roughly we are talking 6 to 9 months if you are doing 5 to 3 hours. Make it a year to a year and a half if it's less than that. Output is a bit less firm as it is going to depend a lot more on psychological factors like individual personality traits, how much you actually identify with the cultures from which you are getting your media, etc.\n\nRegarding talking to patients, you are going to need to get specific input from medical shows and podcasts intended for people who may not work in the field. The reason being that your patients are going to have a very specific set of expectations about your register, choice of vocabulary, etc. And if you are mostly consuming content that is informal and colloquial, something you will have to do to understand people - especially when talking among themselves (a parent and child, a husband and wife)- this is not going to help your output in professional situations as you will likely subvert social expectations. Something that can lead to misunderstandings in situations like what we are talking about.\n\nThere are self-tutoring courses on medical jargon that I would highly recommend you consider looking into to help with this. Combined with large quantities of input, something like this is very likely to be helpful to you because any of the small oddities that can sometimes appear in learner-specific resources will be lost in the deluge of authentic, native content. But, I highly suggest that once you get very comfortable with the content you are consuming, find a native speaker who is a medical student or who has helped other people in your situation, and go through a lot of role-play. Acquisition of field-specific language can be hard for people who are not working in a place where they are immersed in the language used in the field. I am not talking about jargon here. I am talking more about register and the cultural norms of the field as it is practiced in the cultures who speak the language. \n\nTL;DR\n\nGet good at the language generally, find media relating to the medical field, find humans who can help you acquire field specific things like register, linguistic norms, etc.", "created_utc": "1633872026.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hg3mntm", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_q4vtow", "parent_id": "t3_q4vtow", "score": "1", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "Luguaedos", "body": "I have never done this with languages I have learned either.

Or are you listening to podcasts or audiobooks?\n\nI have never learned Japanese so I cannot comment on the average number of hours it takes. But I can give you a good idea of what it was like when I learned Italian. I already spoke Portuguese well. So the first time I tried listening to native content, I actually understood quite a bit. I spent roughly 3 hours per day listening to Italian. 20% of that (more or less) was focused listening. I sat down and tried to understand each and every word. When I could not understand things, I asked a language partner or tutor or someone on Reddit. The rest of the time was spent relistening to things I had already used for focused practice or watching Peppa Pig or some other cartoon. After roughly 16 weeks I probably had a high B1 low B2 comprehension. Around 36 weeks I was able to understand all TV for kids. Adult shows still had parts that I did not understand. Audiobooks were perfectly comprehensible in that I could understand all the words though I still did not understand a lot of vocab. But I could easily write down and look up those words. Within a year, I was watching TV with no problems except for bits of regional language. I would estimate that I had listened to at least 700 hours of native content by that point and had been reading novels for a while. I was easily passing C1 comprehension practice exams.\n\n\\~700 hours in a language much more similar to my own than Japanese is AND I had a head start due to Portuguese. I would imagine that 400 hours of Japanese is just a drop in the bucket, unfortunately.

In my experience very good listening comprehension is a prerequisite skill to speaking a language well because if you cannot distinguish word boundaries, have not acquired the phonology and prosody of the language (all things needed to understand the spoken language well), you cannot not speak well.\n\nNone of which is not to say it is not a hard skill to develop. But it should absolutely be the base skill for any learner. What I have seen in years of working as an English language instructor and years of participating in this  sub, the people who have a hard time at developing this skill in the long run, are not listening enough. You have to be willing to sit for hundreds of hours listening to things that you hardly understand while actively trying to understand them. And I am not exaggerating. It's hundreds of hours. Most people seem to be waiting until the magical day that they understand almost everything before they start listening, not realizing that the day they are waiting for is never coming unless they start.\n\nBut, I want to be clear with what I am trying to express here, in a very practical sense, *you are right*. Most people never get past that hump. It is the barrier to entry for most people who quit. And in that sense it really is the hardest skill to develop because after you have that, everything else gets easier. Even reading. But with out good listening comprehension, speaking well is just not possible.", "created_utc": "1632082412.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hdi7vlr", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_prbpz6", "parent_id": "t1_hdhtot5", "score": "9", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "Luguaedos", "body": "Hello, u/m00nshine__, and thank you for posting on r/languagelearning.

I am knapper and I have worked with both quartz and quartzite. While they certainly could be used to create a dagger for thrusting, the process to manufacture would be far more difficult than with glass and they would hold an edge far less sharp than glass does. You also have to consider that these tools are essentially single use. If you stab someone and it hits bone, there is a good likelihood that the dagger will break or at the very least be chipped and need to be reworked.\n\n1. Much more expensive to create\n2. More prone to natural imperfections that would lead to breakage.\n3. Harder to rework when chipped.\n4. Not as sharp as glass\n\nThe \"dagger\" in this image is for display and is in the form of a slashing weapon with the curves blade. While I would not want to be stabbed by it, I would have very little fear of it as a slashing weapon with just normal clothes on. A glass, obsidian, or flint dagger, though, I don't want to be stabbed by it and as a slashing weapon...
