Jews don't even believe in hell. And there isn't really a concept of heaven in Judaism either. The \"World to Come\" is in this world, after the Messiah comes. And everyone can get a share. Judaism does not claim to definitively know what happens after you die. So how would they possibly know who is \"going to heaven\"?\n\n>make sure to bring a Cow to church and slit its throat in front of the priest, then you're all good!\n\nThis is a gross simplification, as all animals have to be killed a certain way before consumption to be permissible in Judaism. And you would eat the animal after it is \"sacrificed.\" It's just designating this particular animal in service of G-d, and donating some of the meat to the temple to feed the priests and their families, as a compensation (since they were not paid). Notably, \"priest\" here is a hereditary title, and does not refer to an ordained minister (ie. Rabbi). Obviously, this isn't practiced today at all since there isn't a centralized temple in Judaism for such \"sacrificing\" to take place.\n\nIt really bothers me when Christians talk about Judaism like we believe the same things.

But what if we take a step back and consider that 'sleeping' is lexically ambiguous until it is placed into context. We can consider 'Noun' and 'Verb' subtypes of the class of words 'sleeping' belongs to.\n\nPerhaps In English this doesn't make much sense.

'ilen' is the 1ms copula; -len is the contracted suffix form of the copula, which usually causes ultimate vowel changes when contracting (due to the underlying i).\n\nIn other cases the 2 copula forms are non-distinguishing (gisa-ilen = giselen, I am tired). This is with an adjective, which is a whole separate can of worms because adjectives are also just the present perfect verbal form (and must inflect accordingly). \n\nIt is logical and likely that there was a point where there was complete ambiguity for 'maqoe-ilen,' which is a sentence.\n\nMy point being that while the process is similar to English, these are very different languages. And while there may be other syntactic cues in English, we don't necessarily share them. \n\nAt the very basis of it, 'the' is zero-marked. Imagine if in English 'the' was zero marked.

Clearly gets should work differently! \n\nA more malleable ketubah would provide a means to address male-focus-dominance in Jewish marriage and divorce. \n\nI believe that in general, Jews, especially \"Orthodox\" ones, are simply trying their best to hold on to as much of their culture as possible.

Here's a long rundown you (partially) didn't ask for:\n\nSo Linguistics is the study of the structure of human language. What is theoretically possible, what structures exist in the worlds languages, etc. Roughly this breaks down into Phonetics (the actual sound being produced), Phonology (the rules that underpin how underlying sounds of words surface phonetically), Morphology (the study of the segments of words and how they interact and surface; structural hierarchy of segments within words), Syntax (the order of words and structural hierarchy within sentences), & Semantics (the ultimate meanings within a piece of language).\n\nComputational Linguistics focuses on using computers to work with and understand human language through those fields. It is very tied up with Machine Learning and AI, as we want computers to understand human language. This is useful for a variety of tasks (Machine Translation, Speech Recognition, Search Engines, etc). We want computers to perform tasks that require knowledge of human language.\n\nIt is basically an \"Applied Computer Science.\" Because it requires all of the CS fundamentals, even top colleges will likely have only 1 or 2 Computational Linguistics courses in their undergraduate CS programs. The field basically requires a graduate degree - but that degree almost guaranteed to be paid for because it's a massive field with very few people going into it. Also taking graduate courses for undergraduate credit is really not difficult, and getting involved in CL research as an undergrad also isn't difficult for many schools.\n\nSince you haven't applied to schools yet, if you are thinking about this field, I'm going to advise you to look specifically into CS and CL rankings. For example, it could be good to have University of Maryland College Park as a safety (if it still will be a safety by then, admissions are getting rough), as it is basically the only non-T20 school with a competitive CS & specifically competitive CL.

Many hardly know any of it (yes, even Orthodox). The laws directly in the Torah, however, are widely followed.\n\nYou also seem to be making this claim that the laws of the Talmud are completely separate from the Torah. And while some of them are, for the most part it simply aims to \"read between the lines\" and explain practical ways to realized the laws of the Torah. \n\nAny Jew who claims that the Talmud was entirely divinely sourced is misled. It is a long exegesis of humans using the written Torah *and* a collection of outside entities referred to as the Oral Torah and believed to be divinely sourced. The Talmud itself is not the Oral Torah, rather it contains things from it. It **tries** to be complete, but even the most religious Jews don't believe it is. It is said that when Moshe (Moses) passed away, some of the Torah died with him, since some explanations were lost, as only he remembered/knew them. \n\nThe Talmud is held as very authoritative, but even many of the most traditionalist Jews disagree with parts of it,  since some of the logic is based of science we can prove false now, and obviously this means those arguments can't hold.\n\nIn fact, modern Jews mostly base their religious decisions not on the convoluted, difficult to understand Talmud, but a more modern compilation of the laws called the Shulhan Arukh ('Set Table,' ca. 16th century Ottoman Palestine), or a commentary of its first section called the Minshah Berurah ('Clarified Teaching,' ca. 19th century Poland). Familial customs vary wildly, and very very few follow one of these exactly. \n\nMy point is that while Judaism is undoubtedly not the same as it was 3500 years ago (obviously, without a temple about 1/3 of the laws don't even apply), it is difficult to say that it is not remarkably similar. Unlike many other religions, Jews tolerate a wide diversity of opinion on the interpretation of specific laws. No 2 Jewish families practice Judaism the same way. But at the center of it all the Old Testament. Observing Shabbat, Pesah, Sukkot, and Shavuot by refraining from certain activities in some way is universal. Keeping Kosher is some way too. These kinds of practices that Jews do today are very likely remarkably similar to the way Jews thousands of years ago would have done it. Is it exactly the same? No. And sometimes we know how they differ - for example, considering poultry meat for Kashrut purposes is a new-ish thing that all Jews except Ethiopian Jews do. But the not mixing milk and meat is a longstanding practice dating wayyyy back.\n\n---\n\nAlso to claim this:\n\n>Christianity and Judaism (based on the New Testament and the Talmud) are rival interpretations of the religion of the Old Testament.\n\nis completely disingenuous.
