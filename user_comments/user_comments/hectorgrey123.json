Are we talking imported, editable PDFs; customiseable html/javascript sheets; a simple collection of stats like the base Roll20 sheet; or something in between?\n\nSecondly, how much scope for rules automation is there likely to be in this once finished?  One of the more important tools in a vtt for me as the GM is things like being able to automatically assign XP to the party, or being able to create templates which allow me to generate procedural content based on rollable tables.  In addition, a good vtt will allow for automation of things like range penalties (particularly useful in a game like GURPS, where range penalties kick in much closer than in other RPGs, and have a much wider scale), or chart lookups (really useful for a game like RoleMaster, where your attack roll is compared with the armour type on a weapon chart, and the result gives you the amount of damage dealt.\n\nThirdly, are there any plans to allow multiple npc models to share a single statblock?  This is important because there are a number of games (FFG Star Wars, for example) which allow multiple weaker foes to be grouped together as a single stat block in order to allow large numbers of combatants to be run much more quickly.", "created_utc": "1658447688.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ih4exw0", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_w4lj1b", "parent_id": "t3_w4lj1b", "score": "2", "subreddit": "rpg", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh2s"}, {"author": "hectorgrey123", "body": "Here are probably my top five; I couldn't limit myself to just one; not when there are so many really good options.\n\n**Worlds Without Number** feels like the throwback to older editions of D&D combined with more modern mechanics that 5e was intended to be, but does a better job of fulfilling that goal.  I particularly like the fact that out of a 300 page book, only 100 or so pages actually matter to the players (only 30 if they don't use magic), while the rest is there to help the GM to flesh out and run a sandbox for the players to adventure in.  Basically anything I might consider 5e for, I would probably use WWN instead.\n\n**Godbound** (by the same designer as Worlds Without Number) is basically a cross between Exalted and the OSR - the PCs are people given a little bit of divine power who have the potential to become powerful gods in their own right.  The power level of this game is much higher than WWN, and so what counts as a suitable goal for the players must be more in line with their power.  Ending a zombie apocalypse would be the work of a whole campaign in a game like D\\&D; in Godbound it could feasibly be done in a handful of sessions.\n\n**Beyond the Wall and Other Adventures** is an OSR style system which plays like B/X with a few modernisations (such as base attack bonus from 3.x, ascending AC, and higher than average starting ability scores).  Part of why I like it is the premise of a handful of villagers (typically around 16-18 years old) going off on their first adventure, and how character creation ties into this.  Beyond the Wall is designed for running one shots with no preparation prior to play, and so it takes some inspiration from PbtA games by using playbooks for PCs (and then expands the concept to include scenario packs for the GM).\n\nThese playbooks are basically a collection of tables which determine starting ability scores, skills, equipment, and spells for magic users.  They also include points where the players are expected to add locations and NPCs to the starting village.  This process should be done as a group, and typically takes about 40 minutes regardless of the role playing experience of the players, making it an excellent introduction to the hobby for brand new players as well as a good game for impromptu one-shots.\n\n**Crimson Exodus** is a game I've only had a couple of opportunities to run, but I had a lot of fun with it.  It has a unique (to the best of my knowledge) die rolling system, where the ability score determines the number of dice rolled, while the skill determines the die type, and the highest die is the one chosen.  The unique aspect of this is how you can choose to roll fewer, larger dice or more, smaller dice than you would usually have.\n\nIn addition, this game has a damage system based on individual wounds rather than a pool of hit points, and any injury has the potential to have medium to long term effects, but it does this without slowing down play during combat.  Instead, dealing with severe injuries is treated as part of the drama rather than a little extra post-battle book keeping.\n\nIn one one-shot, a PC took a serious hit to the neck and basically required a tracheotomy.  That PC's (the nominal leader of the group) player then had a great deal of fun communicating through mime, while the sneaky backstabber of the group basically took over (giving the leader credit for successes, and chalking up failures to \"misinterpretations\").  Crimson Exodus works best with the Trauma supplement.\n\n**Sword and Scoundrel** is still in development (with a new public beta out soon-ish), but I really do love it.  It takes a lot of inspiration from PbtA and FitD games with its use of clocks for damn near everything, and also from Burning Wheel, but its primary source of inspiration is The Riddle of Steel; a game designed by sword nerd Jake Norwood (if you're into HEMA, then yes; I'm talking about *that* Jake Norwood) to deal with his dissatisfaction with how combat works in D&D.\n\nCombat in this game is dangerous - sharp weapons are capable of doing horrible things to people, so the very fact that they're being used at all ought to be a big deal.  Last time I ran it, someone stood in the middle of a doorway that was guarded by people with muskets, and was shot.  Thankfully, I had a spare pregen that that player was able to play as, because that character basically lost a leg as a result of the injury.\n\nFights can take a while if an NPC has particularly tough armour and the players don't know what weapons and tactics they need to use to get through said armour, and it punishes players who do things that would get them killed in a fight with real weapons, but as a result it lends itself exceptionally well to tense single combat.", "created_utc": "1658445824.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ih4aqc7", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_w4h4am", "parent_id": "t3_w4h4am", "score": "5", "subreddit": "rpg", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh2s"}, {"author": "hectorgrey123", "body": "Yup\n\nEdit: https://www.reddit.com/r/ToiletPaperUSA/comments/rm4c3t/jordan_and_ben_explain_why_women_pretend_to_enjoy/\n\nEdit 2: I refuse to search for the video itself, because I don't need that shit in my YouTube feed.", "created_utc": "1658431969.0", "edited": "1658432352.0", "id": "ih3bmhy", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_w4nnp2", "parent_id": "t1_ih3bj1j", "score": "1", "subreddit": "TooAfraidToAsk", "subreddit_id": "t5_2ssp7"}, {"author": "hectorgrey123", "body": "I mean, with people like Ben Shapiro and Jordan Peterson claiming that women only grudgingly tolerate sex and that the female orgasm is a myth, I wouldn't be too sure...", "created_utc": "1658429310.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ih34kju", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_w4nnp2", "parent_id": "t1_ih33x8j", "score": "95", "subreddit": "TooAfraidToAsk", "subreddit_id": "t5_2ssp7"}, {"author": "hectorgrey123", "body": "Honestly, it's tricky.

Likewise in Supreme Commander, the skill there lies in good decision making rather than being able to press a fixed sequence of keys precisely every 9 seconds.\n\nMicro, imo, should be more about decision making rather than making up for shitty unit AI and pathfinding.

A few common stances are passive (don't attack at all), defensive (only attack if attacked), hold ground (attack anything that comes into range, but don't give chase), and aggressive (attack anything that comes into range and actively give chase if it tries to retreat).  When moving, the only stance which won't defend itself passive, and the default tends to be something like defensive or hold ground.\n\nWith regards to economy, streaming economies are an option here.

Rise of Nations has income as a stream, but expenses are lump sums, and Supreme Commander has them both as streams.  In games where resource expenditure is a stream over time, you can queue just as efficiently as you can manually produce units, but if you have too much production happening at once, all of it will grind to a halt.

Thing is, macro isn't just the production of units and workers, it's also things like the placement of static defences (walling off, for example, and placing turrets), and other aspects of base building that a lot of people love about strategy games both real time and turn based.\n\nHaving said that, some games have much higher skill floors than others, and the higher skill floor can make macro incredibly unfun for low skilled players.  Let's take StarCraft 2, for example (I'm picking this game because it's the blizzard style RTS I'm most familiar with): the knowledge floor isn't too high if you're familiar with RTS games in general, and the campaigns will help lower the knowledge floor by introducing the various concepts better than just jumping into a skirmish match, but the mechanical skill floor is high enough that you have to be particularly skilled before you can even start playing with any kind of intentionality.  At my quite low skill level (I never made it past silver, and that was a few years ago), the macro feels like busywork, and my losses feel like they're due to my inability to remember to expand at the right times or because I mistimed an inject and suddenly one of my queens is wandering away from their hive because the queen that I'd meant to inject with was on 24 energy.\n\nMacro in Supreme Commander, on the other hand, has a negligible mechanical skill floor, but an arguably higher knowledge floor (which can still be reduced by the campaign - particularly since the campaign doesn't frequently feature units or mechanics not found in the multiplayer, unlike SC2).  In this game, macro is entirely down to your decision making - I believe the opening meta eventually solidified around building a factory first, then power generators, then mass extractors, but what type of factory (air or land usually, since naval units take ages to produce without engineer support) and what to produce out of it are largely situational; as is when to build second and third factories and detection and static defences.  Unit production can be automated efficiently (just put a queue of units into the production list then click repeat) due to the streaming economy (resources are gathered and spent as a constant stream over time rather than in lump sums).  This means that even at my low skill level, if i screw up the macro it's because I made a poor decision; not because I mistimed an inject and didn't notice, or some equally frustrating mechanical error.\n\nSo yeah; how fun the macro is in an RTS depends on how it's handled.  If it has a high mechanical skill floor where you have to get the timings right of every individual aspect, it can just as easily feel like tedious busywork that's keeping you away from the fun parts of the game (namely watching enemy units die horribly to your army).", "created_utc": "1643053753.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hu26r01", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_sbp2be", "parent_id": "t1_hu1f7wz", "score": "3", "subreddit": "FrostGiant", "subreddit_id": "t5_3a8dgv"}, {"author": "hectorgrey123", "body": "Wouldn't object to some old school tracker music if it turns out to be a sci-fi RTS.", "created_utc": "1643044364.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hu1hgqo", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_rncrs7", "parent_id": "t3_rncrs7", "score": "1", "subreddit": "FrostGiant", "subreddit_id": "t5_3a8dgv"}, {"author": "hectorgrey123", "body": "So, the first Star Wars game I ever played was an RTS by the name of Force Commander.  While it had a number of flaws and was pretty janky (it was one of the earlier full 3D RTS games), it had a few mechanics I found kind of cool - where the imperial base was a standard immobile base, the rebel base (at least in the campaign; I never really played them in multiplayer) was mobile.\n\nIn addition, some units and buildings could not only be garrisoned, but you could garrison an empty enemy building with your own troops to steal it (if there were troops garrisoned inside, you had to send your own troops inside and they would fight off screen).  Also, while the Rebel units typically weren't quite as strong as their imperial counterparts, the Rebels could steal Imperial vehicles in the same way as the building stealing worked.  This maybe wasn't balanced as well as it could have been, but it's an idea I'd love to see expanded upon.\n\nI like the asymmetry in play styles here; where one side is more powerful but relatively static, while the other is less powerful but more mobile, and is able to steal from the more powerful side.  Again, it wasn't as well balanced in Force Commander as I would like (leading to mostly imperial vs imperial mirror matches in the few multiplayer games I played), but it would be nice to see some iteration on the idea.", "created_utc": "1643043100.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hu1e1xo", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_s8ozpy", "parent_id": "t1_htj18sv", "score": "1", "subreddit": "FrostGiant", "subreddit_id": "t5_3a8dgv"}, {"author": "hectorgrey123", "body": "Agreed - particularly with SC2.  The mechanical skill floor for just basic macro is high enough that being able to macro properly by itself is enough to hit diamond.  For people like me who never made it past silver, it's almost impossible to play with any kind of intentionality on ladder because at that level, it's just a question of who can macro the most efficiently - even if you pick units that counter the opponent's units reasonably well, that only helps if the gap in mechanical macro skill (i.e. pressing the buttons at the right times) is sufficiently small.\n\nI'm told that even when people hit diamond league, differences in mechanical macro ability determine just as many games as any kind of intentionality, and quite frankly that isn't what I play strategy games for.  If I win a game, I want it to be because I made good decisions; not because I was able to press a two or three key combination for worker/unit production with better timing.  Likewise, if I lose a game, I want it to be because I made poor decisions (or they made good ones); not because I was a second or two off pressing the macro buttons at the right times fairly consistently (edit: and forgot to expand at the right times multiple times).\n\nI mentioned in another thread about macro how Supreme Commander does macro - all expenditure is a constant outgoing stream rather than individual lump sums - so while a unit or a building has a fixed cost, this is spent over time as it builds, rather than up front.  This means that you can happily queue up units instead of having to create them at the right times to avoid wasting resources.  On the other hand, this means that you have to balance resource income with expenses, because if you hit 0 resources, all of your production immediately grinds to a halt.\n\nObviously Supreme Commander is a much larger scale RTS than SC2, but Command and Conquer also has expenses streamed while having income be lump sums collected by workers - while the latter game is much simpler in its macro than people here might want, I'm pretty sure there's a middle ground to be found that has a high skill ceiling while still allowing intentionality at low skill levels.", "created_utc": "1643041400.0", "edited": "1643042066.0", "id": "hu19jx0", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_s9e4fd", "parent_id": "t1_htn0zrx", "score": "1", "subreddit": "FrostGiant", "subreddit_id": "t5_3a8dgv"}, {"author": "hectorgrey123", "body": "There are ways around this, imo.\n\nMacro in age of empires, for example, requires you to make decisions about how many workers to use to build a building (trading income for build speed); it has four resources whose importance change over the course of the game (and a market to trade resources for gold); and it has a lot of different upgrades to choose between during play.  In addition, knowing where to build walls is an important decision because there isn't just one entrance to your main.  Sometimes, even which resources in your main to harvest is a strategic decision. \n\nIn supreme commander, all expenses are treated as drain over time rather than being paid up front.  This allows the queuing of units to be just as efficient as perfectly timing each individual unit build.  Instead, you make decisions about how many engineers to assist a factory (trading unit build speed for higher resource drain, since the unit costs the same in total resources), and which factories to focus on between land, air and (on some maps) water.

As such, it's the typically recommended language for Android development nowadays.\n\nJava is absolutely worth learning once you've got a good grounding in either of the above languages, but I've seen far too many beginners confused by this language and to recommended it as a first language.", "created_utc": "1635504665.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hihwmx1", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_qi3huj", "parent_id": "t3_qi3huj", "score": "2", "subreddit": "AskProgramming", "subreddit_id": "t5_2seko"}, {"author": "hectorgrey123", "body": "Insurance companies will take any excuse to not pay.

Ubuntu, Mint, and PopOS are probably the closest, but the fact that I can think of three options off the top of my head means that choosing a distro is more work than an average user is going to put into deciding on a new OS.  After all, we can't expect an average user to distro-hop until they find something that suits them; they need something provides what they need out of the box.\n\nThen, assuming they start with a debian based distro like the three above, we have package management.  All three mentioned distros have a software browser which provides a pretty good selection of software, but if you want to install something that isn't in their catalogue, you're looking at synaptic.  Synaptic is a really useful piece of software if you don't want to go into the terminal, but the UI was designed by a programmer and it shows.  Someone fairly techy is going to be fine with it, but an average user is going to want a lot more polish.  Ideally, you want something that looks like Gnome Software and has all the functionality of synaptic.\n\nNext, Linux needs to be better on laptops, which means it needs better support for hybrid GPUs.  By default, it'll just use the CPU for graphics; you have to explicitly tell it to do otherwise (in steam, for example, this requires editing game settings on a per game basis).  The average user needs to be able to have it just work, like on Windows.\n\nThen, as mentioned in OP's edit, there's the lack of application support.  Microsoft Office is the standard for office software, and while libreoffice is OK, it needs to be able to produce files which will display precisely as intended on Microsoft Office, and Office files need to display precisely as intended in libreoffice, because you are going to be sharing files with Windows users.  Most professional art software is Windows or Apple exclusive.  Making video games is most easily done on Windows even if you intend to support Linux because most of the tools are only available on Windows.\n\nThings like this aren't getting much attention, unfortunately, because the majority of the dev time spent improving the Linux experience is aimed at improving the server experience, because that's where most of the users are.

I don't think the kids pay half as much attention as they'd like me to believe, but there's always one or two with a real passion for the subject.  They don't speak up about it in class, of course - no one wants to be the swot - but you can tell that they're actually interested.\n\nThe national curriculum says I have to teach them certain facts about certain topics, but frankly the facts are boring and frequently pointless.  We had a king who had six wives, he divorced two, had two executed, one died in childbirth and the other outlived him.  Outside of a pub quiz, when is anybody going to need to know the details of that?  That said king had a suit of tournament plate with a massive cock on the front?  Now that's interesting, and it teaches far more about the period than just the details of one king's marital issues.\n\nDon't get me wrong; a couple of the wives have some useful lessons in there - Henry VIII of England went to war during the reformation to defend the Catholic church - the Pope at the time named him \"Defender of the Faith\".  Then, when they refused to let him divorce his first wife for giving him a daughter, he immediately decided to kick them out of England and found his own \"Church of England\", now known as the Anglicans, while at the same keeping the title given to him by the pope.  The lesson being, of course, the people at the top are almost always hypocrites, and will absolutely throw you under the bus if it suits their needs.\n\nNow I've never had much of an interest in political power.  I could have it if I really wanted it, but I've always been too much of an academic at heart - and, as an academic, nothing makes me happier than seeing young minds take an interest in knowledge.  I see them as my own children, in a way.  So when I heard an explosion down the hall from my classroom in a London secondary school, followed by a voice that sounded like it was coming through a synthesizer, I was not impressed.\n\n\"You will give me what I demand, or I will destroy this school and everybody in it,\" came the mechanical sounding voice of some damned fool upstart or other.  I could never keep track of them all; some used science, some had some form of mutation or other, and some were even aliens.  There have always been some, though there seem to be a lot more of them these days; I've heard of more in the last ten years than the previous ten centuries.  I muttered an incantation under my breath to protect myself from impacts, told the students to take cover, then went to see what all the fuss was about this time.\n\nThe fuss, as it happens, was about money.  This idiot who called himself \"Doctor Mechanicus\" attacked my school and threatened my children because he wanted money to keep his equipment maintained; something on the order of a billion pounds.  I just sighed.\n\n\"OK young man, you've had your fun.  Now how about you bugger off back home before things get any worse than they already are, all right?\" I suggested to person in his mechanical armour; covered in gears that I assume must have been for decoration.\n\nThe young fool laughed.  Of course he did; so far as he could tell, I was just an elderly man; a little over six feet tall but quite skinny.  \"But what if I want things to get worse?\" he asked mockingly.\n\n\"Then by all means continue what you're doing, and we shall see just how much worse things can become,\" I said quietly, before muttering a second incantation to allow me to fly.  I hadn't used that one in a very long time - radar has made flying undetected much more difficult than it used to be, and I was never really interested in putting myself out there.  This aspiring supervillain, however, was leaving me little choice.  He lifted a hand, and fired a small swarm of miniature rockets at my feet.\n\nThe explosion knocked me against the wall - were it not for my defensive spell, it would certainly have killed me.  I rose to my feet, and made a show of dusting myself off.\n\n\"Very well then,\" I said, slowly rising off of the floor.  I muttered once more under my breath, and an ebony staff a little longer than I was tall appeared in my hand.  \"I could use the practice.\"\n\nMy next spell, enhanced by my staff, was one of telekinesis.  I snatched \"Doctor Mechanicus\" from the air, and began slamming him against the ground repeatedly.  He let off another salvo of rockets, which I used my telekinesis to divert back at him.  He dodged, and flew directly at me; no doubt hoping that my age would make me vulnerable to brute force.  With an ebony staff reinforced with magical power, I hit his helmet hard enough to put a dent into it, and he lost control of his suit.  I used my telekinesis to bring him safely to the ground.\n\nI removed his helmet to ensure I hadn't killed him, and I recognised him from the school; maybe five or ten years back (it gets hard to remember exactly at my age).  He was breathing, and his heart was still going, so I removed his weaponry and began to heal the injury.  As he regained consciousness, the first thing he heard must have been me saying \"You fucking idiot.  Of all the places to ransom, why a working class school - and of all the schools, why this one?  Now there are witnesses to us fighting, so I can't just let you go.  I am so disappointed.  Remember: those with power will do whatever it takes to keep that power.  Money is power - nobody with access to billions is going to give it to you for a bunch of poor kids.  Fuck.\"\n\n\"Doctor Mechanicus\" was arrested not long after, and I made myself scarce so as to avoid any uncomfortable interviews.

The guy who created bagua zhang, for example, would only teach people who could already fight well.\n\nIt's important to remember, however, that when you get right down to it, fighting is fighting, and the human body can only move in certain ways.  There's a reason the stances and guards in kenjutsu are also found in German and Italian longsword treatises.  Pretty much all grappling looks like BJJ and pretty much all striking looks like kick boxing when applied properly.  There are some exceptions, of course - the spinning kicks of capoeira can be really nasty if they catch you off guard, for example - but it's usually the case.\n\nSo if basically all striking looks like kick boxing, then where are the stances that kung fu and karate are famous for?  They show up all the time in MMA if you know what to look for; they're just almost never held for very long because you're only really mean to step into our out of them.  Cat stance, for example, is only meant to be kept for long enough to either spring forward or to kick with it after having moved all your weight to your rear foot.  In an MMA fight you might see it crop up occasionally when someone ends up having to back up to the edge of the cage.  Horse stance is more common, and the front stance is by far the most common (often lunged into for straight punches).\n\nThe problem that most TMA nowadays has is that the instructors know the forms, but don't know the applications or the theory behind those forms and have never needed to actually use what they teach in a real fight.  They expect the application to look exactly like the form, when the forms are primarily teaching tools (even when they haven't been modified to look cool for competition).  Choy li fut, for example, has a form where the techniques are supposed to be performed with enough power that by the end you should be exhausted - the whole point of it is to build up stamina for longer fights.

My only stipulation was that the players themselves were not allowed to be assholes.\n\nSo here's the setup: the party are travelling back to a nearby city after a successful dungeon raid; it is nearing dusk when they approach a small village.  They decided to stay the night, posting a guard by the wagon full of of bags of holding, each filled with loot (like I said; successful dungeon raid - I also used this to justify letting them have whatever mundane equipment they wanted so long as they could easily get to the wagon).  In the middle of the night, a massive fireball streaks through the sky, impacting in the middle of a nearby forest with a huge explosion, and causing a forest fire.\n\nWith no time to lose, the party immediately left the inn and evacuated their wagon full of loot; taking advantage of the chaos to \"acquire\" some booze to drink as they watched the village burn.  Once the fire had died down (it was only a small patch of woodland rather than a huge forest), they could see what looked like a huge metal disk embedded in the ground at an angle.  Naturally, they went to investigate, and discovered that the huge disk appeared to be a structure of some kind.\n\nThe party made their way inside via a massive, carbon scored hole in the side, and after a while, they encountered the strange inhabitants; short, grey humanoids with no mouths and huge black eyes.  Yeah, that's right, I had a flying saucer in my fantasy game.  Sue me.  Anyway, they proceeded to murder the crew in order to capture their strange weapons, and after some more exploration discovered the main computer (which they did not recognise as such).  Using magic, they repaired the computer, and using the Tongues spell combined with a very good deception roll, they convinced the AI that they had come to rescue the crew, but they had been killed by vengeful natives.\n\nThe AI then informs them of what happened - the ship was shot down in a space battle overhead, and if nothing is done, the pirates who shot them down will soon come to finish the job - and eliminate any witnesses.  The AI taught the party how to use the ship's weapons and other computer systems - it couldn't fly any more, but a few of its weapons were still pointing upwards.  They also learned - to their delight - that the various space faring civilisations did not know that magic was a thing (I reasoned that a civilisation with magic might teleport to other planets, but probably wouldn't bother developing the technology required to send a big piece of metal straight up, and with enough velocity to escape their world's gravitational pull).\n\nThe party used the systems of the ship to work out where the bridge of the pirate ship would most likely be, and teleported aboard.  The bridge crew were skilled, but they had no counter to being carved to ribbons by a ninja using greater invisibility, nor the use of magic from the magus or the bard who were also on board.  At this point, we were running out of time, so I declared that the pirate AI decided that the boarding party were clearly more competent, and so jettisoned the rest of the crew.\n\nThe party then used their new flying saucer to conquer the world, enslaving the dragons to guard their treasure (materials able to withstand reaching the surface temperature of the sun can also withstand dragon fire; even from an ancient red dragon), before going out into space to plunder other worlds and vessels; using their magic against an unsuspecting galaxy.\n\nThat was one of the most fun games I've ever had the pleasure of running, and the players had a blast too.", "created_utc": "1621740739.0", "edited": "False", "id": "gz4jkl9", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_ni3pbm", "parent_id": "t3_ni3pbm", "score": "1", "subreddit": "rpg", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh2s"}, {"author": "hectorgrey123", "body": "Middle Earth had MERP (Middle Earth Role Playing), which was basically RoleMaster in Middle Earth.

The combat tracker, in most rulesets (I think Rolemaster Classic is the only exception), does not assume the use of a map or minis, and makes it it really easy to keep track of who is targetting which NPC, how much health they all have, what their attacks are, and other important details without having to open up their individual sheets.\n\nIt also has a party tracker which displays skills you might want to roll for them in secret; random tables (which run off of dice rather than numerical weightings, allowing for tables of 3d6 without needing to break out the calculator); random encounter generators which allow you to click a button and get an encounter which you can add to the combat tracker whenever you wish; items which can be added to character sheets and have separate names for when they're identified and when they're not (this also applies to NPCs).\n\nIt is, however, the most expensive option, at close to ~~$200~~ (Edit: I misremembered; it's $150) for the ultimate license (the one that lets you run for people who haven't paid themselves), so it would take a couple of years to pay for itself, or else $40 per player for the standard license.  You can, of course, get a subscription - the ultimate license is a $10 per month subscription, which is more affordable but once you stop paying, you lose access.  In addition, while the official rulesets are good, you also have to pay for those and some are more expensive than others.\n\nD&D 5e is probably the most expensive system to run, if you're not just using the free basic rules, at $40 - $50 per book (though I would say that it's worth it because of all the automation work that goes into making each one of those books more useful than just having the books on D&DBeyond).  The Paizo games are less expensive; particularly if you already have PDFs, as you get the price of the PDF as a discount on their Fantasy Grounds products (or a free copy of the PDF if you didn't already own it).\n\nIt also has official rulesets for AD&D 2e (the ruleset is free, but the three core books are $20 apiece), D&D 3.5 (has SRD content, but no actual rule descriptions), D&D 4e (no content, but all the automation), Savage Worlds ($10), Fate Core ($5), Vaesen ($30), Call of Cthulhu ($30 for 7e; $15 for 6e), Vampire the Masquerade 5e ($50), Index Card RPG ($20) and a bunch of others - it is by no means focused on D&D 5e.  In addition to all the paid rulesets, there are also a bunch of free rulesets made by community members (though as such, quality and compatibility with the Unity version may vary).  This includes rulesets for GURPS, Fantasy Dice, Advanced Fighting Fantasy 2e, Trail of Cthulhu, and Nights Black Agents, to name a few.\n\nUnfortunately, Fantasy Grounds does come with a few weaknesses.  The first is that in order to create custom rulesets, you need a good grounding in Lua and XML - the documentation provided is pretty terrible, and there are no good tutorials for creating your own.  Ruleset Wizard does make this much easier, but it is a paid third party product, and it will only work on Windows.  In addition, it has no support for voice chat - it was built assuming people would use text chat, and has features to improve that instead (such as allowing people to change language and only be understood by people who speak that language, and making it really easy to switch between which character is talking when multiple characters are being controlled).  Finally, unlike Roll20 and Foundry, it has no built in support for playing custom audio.\n\nA much cheaper paid option is Foundry, which is a $50 flat purchase.  As far as I'm concerned, everything Roll20 does, Foundry does better, and within 5 months cheaper too.  It is by far the best option for maps and minis, imo - having been built from the ground up to support dynamic lighting, line of sight, animated maps, and various other goodies.  Foundry also requires specific rulesets in order to support its automation, and there are many such rulesets available from the community (quality and compatibility with the latest version varies), and there have been some premium paid rulesets recently added.\n\nOn the other hand, Foundry is a self-hosted web application - to connect to your game, players connect to your computer via a web browser, and I believe it requires a HTTPS connection to support voip.  The benefit to Foundry being a web application is that creating custom rulesets requires knowledge of html and javascript, which is a much more common skill set.  Because it's so much easier to develop for, Foundry has a truly ludicrous amount of custom functionality, allowing for features like seeing areas of other maps (for example, if someone is on an upstairs map and there's a balcony, they can see over the balcony and see whichever characters are on the map for the lower floor).\n\nIf maps, minis, and in-game audio are your main reason for using a VTT, then Foundry is by far the best option of the three.  If you use them for the automation, then Fantasy Grounds is better if you have the budget, but Foundry is also pretty good and is much, much cheaper.  Roll20 is the one you use if you don't want to pay (and for that, I wouldn't blame you one bit).", "created_utc": "1621385564.0", "edited": "1621385904.0", "id": "gyn1loa", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_ndzzix", "parent_id": "t3_ndzzix", "score": "3", "subreddit": "rpg", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh2s"}, {"author": "hectorgrey123", "body": "As I recall, the damage roll can ace (though I might be mistaken).", "created_utc": "1621299706.0", "edited": "False", "id": "gyijsn9", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_neqdzo", "parent_id": "t1_gyi0qc8", "score": "7", "subreddit": "rpg", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh2s"}, {"author": "hectorgrey123", "body": "I mean, as an anarchist I don't really consider any state legitimate, but let's move past that for now.\n\nHere's the thing about terrorism: terrorist leaders attack civilians not just to be cruel, but to provoke exactly the kind of reaction that Palestine has received - a brutal crackdown that serves only to generate sympathy for the terrorists.  The fact that innocent civilians in Palestine are losing their homes and families to Israeli air strikes is the best recruitment tool hamas could possibly ask for, and the longer the violence continues.  IDF troops gunning down protesters for throwing stones and medics for trying to help them is likewise a fantastic recruitment tool.\n\nI don't even know if peace in the region is possible at this point, given just how much blood has been spilled over the 80 or so years that Israel has existed as a political entity, but when you get right down to it, the Israeli government are the ones with the power here.  Again, it's hard to get people to see you as anything other than the enemy when you keep blowing up their homes, destroying crucial infrastructure like clean water, and destroying aid on a whim.\n\nMaybe though, just maybe, if the Israeli government at least showed a willingness to act like the responsible grown-up and respect a ceasefire, that would at least be a start.  It would, at least, make them much harder to paint as the bad guy.  You don't beat a terrorist organisation militarily; not short of genocide.

While it does have an assumed cosmology (the god machine, which is exactly what it sounds like), this can be easily ignored.  I particularly like how more long term injuries (like how a sprained ankle isn't life threatening, but will take a while to heal) can be modelled within the mechanics outside of the health system.  It is fairly expensive as PDFs go at around \n\nFor fantasy, I would highly suggest taking a look at Beyond the Wall and Other Adventures, and its supplement Further Afield.  Beyond the Wall is designed based on older editions of D&D for running one shot adventures with little to no prep, and it does that really well.  While it isn't particularly interesting mechanically, the way it accomplishes low-prep gameplay is well worth a look.  The PDFs are $10 apiece, and there are a bunch of free supplements to go with them for things like having someone play a level 2 mentor character, or having the characters come from a noble's estate rather than a small village.\n\nFor character creation, each player gets a playbook based on a theme (like the would be knight, or the witch's prentice, for example), and each book has a collection of random tables designed to provide backstory and a village from which they all originate, giving them immediate reasons to care about the setting.  Character creation at the table tends to take about 30 minutes, regardless of player experience, and I particularly like it for introducing new players to the hobby for this reason.\n\nThe GM gets a bunch of scenario packs, like the playbooks, which are designed to incorporate the stuff from character and village creation into the adventure, alongside some random tables to keep the adventure fresh.  This results in pretty much no adventure running the same way twice.  It's also really good practice for improvisation at the table, making it a pretty good option for newbie GMs.\n\nFurther Afield takes this philosophy and applies it to sandbox campaigns, bringing in player input for setting creation by asking what their characters have heard about in the setting, and then rolling dice to see how accurate their information is.  In addition, it also comes with campaign threats, such as a huge dragon or an undead plague, with random tables for specifying certain details.  These threats also come with optional tables for the player, which determine how the character has been affected by the threat already and can change some of their stats.\n\nGURPS Lite is free, and can be used to run basically anything - it's a far better introduction than the actual core rulebooks (which are $45 between them even for PDFs - possibly worth it if you like the Lite version and you have the budget later).  I would add [this blog from the mook](https://www.themook.net/gamegeekery/new-to-gurps-welcome/) as an introduction to how the system is supposed to run in play.  Even if you don't play GURPS, the supplements are typically well written and researched to the point of being worth having just for the non-mechanical information.  The horror book is particularly well written.\n\nFor a more narrative-focused experience, Fate Core and Fate Accelerated are both well worth a look - they are both pay what you want for the PDF (including free), and while they do use specific dice (which are thankfully not as hard to get hold of or as expensive as genesys or the one ring dice), they are basically a d3-2 each.  If you're playing online, then most die rollers have support for them.  There's a comic that gives a rough idea of how Fate Core works [here](https://www.uptofourplayers.com/ready-to-roll/fate-core-rules/).\n\nFor OSR, I'd suggest picking up White Hack third edition.  I have the second edition in notebook format (which is to say, about 60 pages of rules followed by nearly 200 pages of dotted note paper for notes and maps and suchlike), and while I have yet to get the chance to play it, I'm looking forward to it.  It is $10 for the PDF, and there is a phone optimised version of the PDF for ease of use at the table.\n\nI would also suggest picking up Godbound - the free version is basically the full game, and it is really good at high powered sandbox.  As a warning, however, the players need to understand that the goals of an adventurer are insufficient for this kind of game - the kind of thing that might be a campaign to itself in most games might be solved in a handful of sessions in Godbound due to their power level.\n\nIf you're interested in seeing where D&D 3e got its skill system from (not to mention some fairly entertaining critical hit tables), and don't mind some of the most detailed character creation rules I've ever seen (which, in fairness, makes it the most flexible class system I've ever seen), Rolemaster might be worth a look.  The cheapest option is Rolemaster Fantasy Roleplaying, which is roughly $20 for a single pdf; the other editions require multiple rulebooks that cost $15-20 apiece.", "created_utc": "1621091979.0", "edited": "False", "id": "gy80tj4", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_ncsmkk", "parent_id": "t3_ncsmkk", "score": "2", "subreddit": "rpg", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh2s"}, {"author": "hectorgrey123", "body": "Real men do cry.

Not as nasty as the five round burst, but unless folks push their constitution pretty high, they're still going to have to make those saving throws.\n\nBecause most PCs aren't going to be wearing a lot of armour, a single hit can potentially take a character with even 100hp out of a fight, and AC doesn't increase as fast as to hit bonuses, using cover is significantly more important than in D&D.\n\nI played Star Wars d20 back in the day, which imo handled automatic fire better (minor penalty for extra attacks), used a wounds/vitality system wherein the hp bloat is basically your luck and minor cuts/bruises, and you get a Wounds value equal to your CON score.  Energy weapons deal three dice of damage - a heavy blaster pistol like the one used by Han Solo does 3d8.  With an average of 13-14, a single crit from that will take out most PCs.  As such, cover (and flanking enemies in cover) is an important aspect of combat that typically gets ignored in D&D.\n\nNow the system does have its own problems (good luck having a climactic lightsaber duel at level 19-20 when a natural 20 from either side basically means the other taking 36 points of damage out of that pool of wounds equal to their Con score), but it does ranged combat pretty well.", "created_utc": "1620414815.0", "edited": "False", "id": "gxb2pan", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_n70q5q", "parent_id": "t1_gxa7vf9", "score": "6", "subreddit": "rpg", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh2s"}, {"author": "hectorgrey123", "body": "So, I bought Dungeondraft quite a while ago (pre 1.0), and for some reason the latest version listed in my humble bundle account is 0.944.

The book doesn't really have much GM advice unfortunately, but what it does have is reasonably decent.  The scenario packs are intended to be run as one shots, with very little (basically no) prep, while the character packs create characters with a little bit of background tying them into the world and the party.  Further Afield then gives additional mechanics and advice for longer term campaigns.  Each of these two books is $10 as a PDF.\n\nFor old school RPGs, Red Box Basic is the gold standard.  I don't know if you'd be able to get hold of a physical copy nowadays, but the PDFs are available on drivethruRPG for relatively cheap.  The players' book introduces the mechanics and the assumptions of the game through a couple of choose your own adventure sections, before moving onto a general reference document, while the DM's book contains not only a great deal of sound advice for beginners, but also includes a partially completed dungeon as an exercise for the GM - the first level of the dungeon is fully completed; the second level is mapped and has a list of monsters, but it is up to the GM to place them, and the third level just describes the boss at the end, leaving it to the GM to design everything else.  I particularly like this, because it gets the newbie GM used to creating their own content for the players.  This game is $10 as a PDF.\n\nThe recently released Worlds Without Number, while it is a potentially intimidating 400 pages long, is significantly simpler than that would imply.  While it comes with a default setting (far future Earth, following millennia of alien rule, where practically everything fantasy-related is \"sufficiently advanced technology\"), it comes with pages and pages of tools for creating an interesting fantasy world of your own, decent advice for rookie GMs, tools for creating adventures if the GM is stuck, and even a minigame for the GM to play as part of prep, having large factions pursue their own agendas in the world between adventures so that the world feels alive.  This game also comes with a free version, which is missing only the final 50 pages of the paid version (so, more heroic PCs, god-like PCs, a few classes specific to the default setting, and a couple of additional random tables for things like NPC relationships), making this a particularly good option if you just want to point somebody at a PDF.

You need some way to tell them apart; some dice sets come with a tens die (10, 20, 30 etc.) while others don't - if you don't have a tens die, you'll need a d10 of a different colour from the first.

Foundry has taken over since then, for the simple reason that, with the exception of being able to buy adventure modules, it does pretty much everything Roll20 does only better, and the only thing I really miss from Fantasy Grounds now is being able to use combat tracking without needing a map or tokens.\n\nThings that led me to Foundry over Fantasy Grounds:\n\n* As a web based application, I have Foundry hosted on a small VPS, meaning that I don't have to mess around with port forwarding - given many people who rent don't have access to their own router (myself included), this makes just hosting a game much simpler.\n* Also, because the application is web based, it uses HTML and JavaScript for just about everything, making customisation much, much easier than in Fantasy Grounds, where you have to use a poorly documented Lua library and a basically undocumented XML schema in order to customise anything.\n* If you don't particularly need anything too custom to your rules system, a user created a ruleset called the Sandbox System Builder, where you can literally just build character sheets for PCs and NPCs, and item sheets for basically everything else, while not having to do any coding.  It's a pain to do anything really complicated with it, but if all you want is a character sheet then it's a damn sight better than what Roll20 and Fantasy Grounds have to offer for otherwise unsupported systems.\n* The PDFoundry module allows you to upload PDFs to your server and share them with the players.  This makes it far, far easier to share rules with your players without having to rely on everybody having their own copy, and in contrast with Fantasy Ground's reference library, doesn't require dealing with the XML schema.  Not only that, but it also has support for the use of form fillable PDFs for use as character sheets.\n* The fact that it's a web based application that I have installed on a VPS means that I don't have to get people to download client software; instead I can just point them to a URL, and it takes them straight to the game in their browser.\n* The overwhelming number of modules to allow you to customise aspects of your experience from the appearance of the in game interface to having separate chat and dice logs for separate maps (making dealing with split parties easier - particularly since I tend to prefer text over voice chat for in character interaction), integrating twitch chat into the GM's chat feed (for folks who like to stream their games), floating numbers over tokens to indicate damage taken, a temporary health bar that overlays on top of a usual health bar, and a lot of stuff that I'm clearly missing.\n* While I don't much care about maps and tokens, they are a definite weakness for Fantasy Grounds, and I can definitely see how they might be more useful in a VTT that includes placeable sound, lighting, and (with modules) even segments of other maps so you can have people on a balcony on one map see the people below them on their own map.", "created_utc": "1615255590.0", "edited": "False", "id": "gqa6s6n", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_m0nfs7", "parent_id": "t3_m0nfs7", "score": "5", "subreddit": "rpg", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh2s"}, {"author": "hectorgrey123", "body": "Well, that sucks; I hope you have friends who are more accepting than your parents, and while as a cis guy I'm not the most knowledgeable, you're welcome to PM me if you need to talk.

The first thing to note is that the autism spectrum is more comparable to wheel than a line, expressing which aspects a person needs support with and which they don't.  My partner (also autistic) is verbal, and would be considered by many to be \"high functioning\", but I'm the one that does the cooking because they have severe memory problems.\n\nExecutive function is troublesome for me - as I understand it, most people are generally able to imagine the result of a completed task (tidying a room, for example), and are therefore able to just do it.  I am not, and as such I typically need to work out what needs to be done before what before I get started, or else the prospect of doing a large (if still simple) task can be overwhelming.  As a child, I used to express this as not knowing where to start - because I didn't.  There were too many smaller tasks to perform, and I had no idea what order I should do them in.\n\nIn addition, there are many times where I know I should go and get a shower, or make food, or some other task, but I just can't seem to make my body perform the movements required to do the task.  I typically find myself feeling pretty useless in these situations, and it can be pretty depressing.\n\nIn terms of sensory perception, I tend to see things in more granular detail than most.  Faces are difficult for me, because I see individual components rather than a cohesive whole.  Sound is like this too; the background noise of a busy bar, for example, is less of a mass of sound, but is instead twenty or thirty different things that my brain tries to keep track of all at once; I notice the conversations of the four or five tables within ten feet of me, and against my will my brain will try to keep track of all of them.\n\nI still recall one time where I entered a bar where it felt like I was hit with a physical wall of noise and smell, able to pick out the different beers and spirits, the stupidly loud music and at least five conversations that I couldn't make out details for but could hear them as separate sources of noise all the same.  I had to leave immediately.  Nightclubs generally are a special kind of torture that I need to be particularly drunk to even tolerate.\n\nThen, of course, we have the social stuff.  Because we typically don't see faces and bodies as cohesive wholes, we don't tend to pick up on body language and facial expressions.  As such, aside from really obvious cues like crying (and even then, I can't distinguish between happy and sad tears), laughing and smiling, I cannot tell how a person feels from looking at them.  As a result of this, I tend to keep talking and talking about things that the listeners are slowly getting bored (or, worse, upset) by, completely oblivious to their reactions unless someone actually tells me - something that people typically don't do, because they assume I already know.\n\nIn terms of morality and ethics, I have always had a fairly black and white perspective (even though I know intellectually that things are rarely so simple).  When I was a kid, I based this on written rules; nowadays, it's a question of how it impacts people on a sociological level.\n\nAutism definitely has its plus sides though - I have an incredibly detailed imagination, to the point where I sometimes have to remind myself that an imagined scenario didn't actually happen.  I can also focus on a single task for a really long period of time, keeping lots of related details in mind at once.  It makes programming (something I particularly enjoy) a lot easier in the moment.  I'm also pretty good at remembering game mechanics in detail, which helps with GMing RPGs.\n\nFinally, my more detailed senses make picking up accents easier - which helped me sound particularly natural when I learned to speak Welsh.  It also helps me pick up on things in more complex music (such as orchestral pieces) that others would miss.  Also, while negative physical sensations are amplified, so are positive ones.

The former means you just need to recharge the battery packs between engagements, and the latter means that a zero-recoil weapon is pretty much required.\n\nFor troops on the ground, it's going to be a trade off between cheap training and less ammunition to ship vs needing to ensure the troops have ready access to a working generator between engagements.

This is because we believe hierarchy to be erosive to the human spirit, in a way that we feel is demonstrated by the fact that so many people suffer from mental illness related to the stresses of modern life.  Some hierarchy may be justified (such as how a parent must sometimes protect a young child from themselves), but most are not.\n\nTwo hierarchies that we tend to focus on are capitalism (defined as an economic system wherein resources are privately owned by a relatively small number of people, and everyone else must compete with each other for the opportunity to sell large portions of their lives in exchange for scraps) and the state (defined as a body of professional politicians with a monopoly on the legitimate use of violence).\n\nHaving said that, not all hierarchies are made equal.  The state, for example, exists primarily to protect other forms of hierarchy (usually but not always including capitalism - see the ussr), but one way in which it does so is to prevent those at the bottom from becoming so desperate that they are willing to lose what little they have left by arming themselves and dismantling the hierarchies by force.  As such, we tend to favour state intervention to reduce the harm done by other hierarchies (such as laws that prevent businesses from requiring their workers to work 16 hour days, for example).\n\nIn answer to your question about the USA, I imagine most of us would agree that it should not exist at all, but neither should basically any other country as a political entity.  Instead, people should be free to live where they wish, as they wish, with whomever they wish.  Humans are social animals, and we would still form communities - and those communities would almost certainly have rules.  The difference is, those rules would not come from above, but would be discussed and agreed upon by the community as a whole.  Capitalism as an economic system would be gone, but there are almost as many ideas about what would replace it as there are anarchists.  Personally, I favour something akin to communism, wherein everybody contributes what they can to the community and is able to take what they need, but some prefer a market based economy.\n\nA channel on YouTube by the name of Libertarian Socialist Rants has an excellent series of videos on the subject, as does Philosophy Tube (though both do wear their biases on their sleeves - the latter also has a pretty good series explaining the political philosophies underpinning antifa).

Not in terms of Warhammer, but in terms of more complex games which had rules designed to emulate reality close enough for real world tactics to be just as useful as they would be were the situation actually real.  These more complex war games would typically involve a referee, whose job it was to make impartial rulings about situations either not covered by the rules, or where the rules are unclear.\n\nIn the more complex of these war games, the different sides would be in different rooms, and would have potentially unreliable information about what the other side (or even their own side) was doing.  In these games, one side might choose to bribe an opposing officer, in which case it would be up to the referee to decide how likely that would be to succeed.\n\nPerhaps the earliest example of role playing was a war game run by Dave Arneson; where a number of players played different roles leading up to and during a battle for a small village.  Two of them were commanders of opposing armies, but some were lower ranking officers, some were merchants, and some were politicians.\n\nOnly combat was dictated by rules; everything else was rulings made by the referee based on what common sense dictates the result of the situation would be.  This even included what soldiers might do based on the actions of other players - the commanders of the armies were not in direct control of their troops, but merely sent orders which the referee would interpret (again, taking common sense into account).\n\nSo, how does this bring us to old school D&D?  Well, Dave Arneson and Gary Gygax were both keen war gamers.  Gary Gygax had written a medieval war game called Chainmail, which had relatively simple rules for mass combat and slightly more detailed rules for single combat (wherein the odds of landing a killing blow were represented as 2d6 vs a target number based on the weapon being used and the armour being worn by the target).\n\nDungeons and Dragons was the answer to the question of \"What would it be like to play just one of these soldiers?\"  The very first edition of Dungeons and Dragons (the white box) was an add on for Chainmail, and was intended to use the war game's rules for combat.  Distances were provided in inches because Chainmail already had a scale intended for miniatures.  However, because he couldn't be certain that new players would have access to Chainmail, Gygax also included an alternative combat system - where you'd have a to hit table with a number you need to roll above on a d20, depending on the type of armour (or Armour Class) of your target.\n\nThe idea of this first edition was that the Dungeon Master would have a dungeon of at least three levels (with room for expansion) where the players (between 6 and 12, typically) would go on an expedition.  These dungeons would have traps, hidden passages and compartments, and wandering monsters.  Combat was dangerous, so best avoided if there was no benefit to it.  If you could negotiate with the goblins in one part of the dungeon, you might get safe passage through their territory - or even backup against the orcs in a different part of the dungeon.  There was some XP gained through combat, but the lion's share was gained by safely returning treasure to \"civilisation\".\n\nIn addition to this, logistics were important.  Without food and water, the party will die of thirst or starvation.  Without lanterns, the party won't be able to see in the dark passages in which they're exploring.  Without spare oil, those lanterns will eventually go out.  Without arrows, your bows are useless except as expensive firewood.  When arrows hit stone, they generally break; when they hit flesh, they might still be useable.  If you find an empty room that's relatively easy to defend, it's worth hiding some supplies there and using it as a place to retreat to if a fight starts going badly (like how in John Wick 2, John leaves a shotgun and a rifle at a couple of places he knows he's going to have to retreat through later).\n\nThe thing is, just as in the war games of old, the only rules were for combat, with the addition of a \"saving throw\" to give a character a last ditch chance of survival against something which might otherwise kill them.  Everything else was based upon the players' descriptions of their actions, and the DM acting as a referee; making impartial rulings on the results of their actions.  This first release only had three classes - you were a magic user, a cleric, or a fighting man.\n\nWant to search for a hidden compartment?  Where are you searching, and how?  You don't get a die roll; the DM simply decides based on your actions.  Want to negotiate safe passage through goblin territory?  What do you say?  What are you willing to offer them?  Role play it out.  There is no die roll beyond maybe determining the starting attitude of goblins with whom you're negotiating.  If you're planning a particularly dangerous expedition, it might be worth hiring on some mercenaries to come with you, in exchange for either a flat rate and/or (more likely and) a share of the loot.\n\nEventually, you would have enough money and power to set yourself up as a powerful political entity in your own right.  You might delve dungeons personally to deal with some situations, but just as often you'd be at the head of an army, Mount and Blade style.\n\nLater, a number of additional rules were added, including a chart that made some weapons better or worse against certain types of armour, various classes like the thief, the druid, the assassin and the monk, different dice for determining hit points and damage, locational damage, and a bunch of other things.\n\nEventually, Advanced Dungeons and Dragons was released, which was a standardised collection of the many different optional rules which had been added to the base game over the preceding years.  Basic Dungeons and Dragons, meanwhile, was released as just the first three levels of the original game.  Moldvay Basic, and later Red Box Basic, branched off from Advanced Dungeons and Dragons here, but they still had the same kind of experience in mind - the players explore dangerous places and bring back fabulous treasures.\n\nModules of the AD&D 1e and Moldvay era (and before) tended to just be a single dungeon, and maybe the surrounding region.  B2 (Keep on the Borderlands) is an excellent example of this - a fortified town, with some detailed NPCs, information on defences, and information on how much money is kept where in the various homes and businesses (just in case the PCs wanted to attack the town for whatever reason), the surrounding wilderness with its bandit camp and village of lizard folk, and a cave system with a bunch of different, competing factions who the players might fight or might negotiate with as they prefer.  Why do the PCs go there?  Because there's adventure to be had.\n\nAD&D 2e was where D&D started to focus a little more on story telling, and a lot less on exploration.  XP for treasure recovered was removed, and as a result, the only reliable way for gain advancement was through combat.  There were optional rules for bonus XP based on your class - XP for treasure returned was given back to the thief, while spell casters got bonus XP for casting spells in a useful way, priests got bonus XP for turning undead, and warriors just got double combat XP.  Modules of this era tended to have more of a focus on telling a story too, and started to make the assumption that the PCs were always on the side of good.\n\nSo yeah; on the off chance you made it to the end of this small novella, modern D&D is about creating high fantasy action adventure stories (which is not a bad thing - I love playing modern D&D).  OSR games are, at low level, about exploring dangerous places and getting out alive (and with a bunch of treasure), while at high level they're about using the accumulated wealth and power to have a real impact on the world (for good or ill).", "created_utc": "1596726337.0", "edited": "False", "id": "g0kheft", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_i3kw4c", "parent_id": "t1_g0i2x6f", "score": "1", "subreddit": "rpg", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh2s"}, {"author": "hectorgrey123", "body": "Pathfinder 2e is probably the most expensive option there, what with the number of books you'd want for the full experience (core rules, gamemastery guide, and bestiary at minimum, with advanced players guide for additional character options, like being a martial artist without the spiritual aspects of being a monk), but it's a pretty good option at higher levels and does offer a fair bit of character diversity (particularly with the advanced players guide available).\n\nAnother option you might enjoy is 13th Age.

If I wanted to run something set in Gondor a generation or two prior to the events of the hobbit, Burning Wheel would probably be the better option.\n\nWith that out of the way, it's important to remember that you are playing heroes - the game calls this out by specifically referring to PCs as \"Player Heroes\".  At worst, you might be an anti-hero, but even then you're skirting the line of corruption.  In character creation, you pick your character's culture, and from there you pick how the culture informs your character.  This gives you your starting stats and a favoured skill.  Then you pick a calling, which gives you favoured skill groups and the way in which your character might succumb to the pervasive evil of the world.\n\nEach character has Endurance and Hope pools - Endurance goes down from the physical challenges of travel and from combat, while Hope goes down from the mental and emotional challenges of facing what can be a particularly foul and violent world.  As your Endurance goes down, you become weary based on your carried gear, and you collapse from exhaustion when you hit 0.\n\nWhen your Hope drops low enough to equal your Shadow rating (which starts at 0, but increases as people you care about get hurt or you do bad things - note what I said about playing as an anti-hero), you become miserable, and risk a bout of madness (think Boromir's final interaction with Frodo).  At a 0, you become spent, with no more will to struggle on unless forced.\n\nIf you have a bout of madness, you gain a point of permanent shadow, and then reset your shadow to its permanent rating and gain a flaw based on your calling's shadow flaw.  A hobbit scholar might become haughty, then scornful, then scheming, then treacherous, before finally doing something so beyond the pale that they are no longer playable.\n\nUltimately, the mechanics are such that, were Lord of the Rings not already a pre-written story, its events could easily be the outcome of a campaign.  Moria could easily be used as an example of play (with a major npc nixed at the last minute because Gandalf is absolutely not a playable character).", "created_utc": "1590424784.0", "edited": "False", "id": "frs5h3c", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_gq5xty", "parent_id": "t1_frrimz1", "score": "2", "subreddit": "rpg", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh2s"}, {"author": "hectorgrey123", "body": "For lord of the rings, I'd probably go with the one ring over burning wheel- it catches the feel of the setting far better imo.", "created_utc": "1590398515.0", "edited": "False", "id": "frr57fv", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_gq5xty", "parent_id": "t1_frqy4ro", "score": "3", "subreddit": "rpg", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh2s"}, {"author": "hectorgrey123", "body": "True - but few things are truly impossible.

A package manager is, simply put, a piece of software that creates easy to install and uninstall packages - these tend to be connected to online repositories, making installing and updating software incredibly easy.\n\nFor example, to install a decent text editor in Windows requires you to go to the website, download the executables, install them, and check for patches every so often to keep it up to date.  On linux, I can type a command into the command line that does the downloading and installing, and that keeps track of the version so that a different command will download any and all software updates which are available.  This includes system software, meaning that in many cases, system updates don't require a reboot.\n\nThe command line, meanwhile, is far, far better than the default windows command line (I can't really compare it to power shell, having never used it).  Creating a bunch of empty files is as simple as using the touch command followed by a list of filenames, while searching a text file using regular expressions is as (relatively) simple as piping the output from the cat command into grep, then piping the result into less for easier readability.\n\nIt also helps that many of the most common programming languages have support installed by default - if the GCC (GNU Compiler Collection, I believe) supports a language, you can compile it on your system, and most distros come with Python installed.  This software is, naturally, updated as and when you choose to do a system update.\n\nFinally, though this is far less to do with programming, it's nice to have an OS that just works.  Don't get me wrong; linux used to be a pretty major pain in the ass to get configured properly (I remember when I first made the switch, getting wifi working was a nightmare due to lack of working drivers), but nowadays most distros really do just work straight out of the box, with no adverts, no randomly installing software you didn't ask for, and no analytics.

Only five minutes before, I had been in the forge, making some horseshoes for a nearby farmer, when everything went grey; kinda like when you black out.  When I came to, I found myself in a space that I could only describe as a void; just a complete empty nothingness that my brain interpreted as \"black\", with the exception of a small group of other entities.  There was a single person of each of the elder races - each of whom looked like the most perfect specimen of that species.\n\n\"That is correct,\" the elf answered.  The chief of the elf gods, in fact, and the creator of their species.  \"As such, we cannot agree on what each of our children must sacrifice in order to make them balanced with the humans.\"\n\n\"In that case, it seems to me that maybe instead of having all of your children sacrifice something that makes them - them, perhaps a better answer might be to raise the power of the humans instead,\" I suggested, wondering how that might work.\n\n\"Indeed?\" asked the dwarf, intrigued.  \"I must admit, the idea of not having to lose anything while improving the humans' lot does sound better.\"\n\n\"So, the elves have their countless centuries of long life, but the birth of a new elf is exceptionally rare.  They are stronger and more agile than humans, though weaker than the dwarves and not so clever as the gnomes.  The dwarves are by far the strongest of the races, not to mention more durable by far than humans.  The gnomes, meanwhile, are far more inventive than humans, though they lack even our strength.  The dwarves and the gnomes also live for centuries, where a human might, if they avoid injury or disease, achieve a single century of life.\"\n\n\"Correct,\" replied the elf.\n\n\"Then here is my suggestion: improve the healing of humans.  With us more likely to reach our fiftieth year of life, we might as a species achieve things on a par with your own children's achievements, even though it would take many generations.  With improved healing, our women would be better able to survive the rigours of childbirth, which would increase our numbers - again, making up for the individual superiority of any given elf or dwarf.  I'm not speaking of regenerating limbs, but if I could not only survive, but continue fighting after taking a wound that would be lethal to a dwarf, that might improve our standing greatly.\"\n\n\"You would be tougher than the dwarves?\" demanded the dwarf, outraged.\n\n\"Not at all.  The dwarves would remain harder to seriously hurt in the first place; we would simply be better able to survive the damage.  Or, alternatively, remain alive long enough to achieve something truly impressive - say, for example, if a human were to be stabbed through the heart, and yet remained able to fight for a solid minute before collapsing and dying from the wound.\"\n\nThe elf frowned thoughtfully.  \"You do realise, of course, that the majority of humans would never notice the change?  That they would live out their lives without ever needing that enhanced healing beyond merely being able to give birth four or five times in their lifetime rather than the usual two?\"\n\n\"I do.

Language isn't just an academic skill; it's a set of four separate but related skills.  To get good at speaking the language, you need to actually speak it outside of class.  One thing that might help is scripting out some basic conversations to practice with your friend (and I do mean basic - two or three questions per person, plus answers to those questions).  It's OK to feel like you're struggling to recall the words; your brain forgets things it doesn't think it will use, and the more you struggle to recall something, the longer it will stick the next time (up to a point).  It's likewise OK (and, I would argue, essential) to make mistakes while using the language.  Making a mistake and receiving a correction likewise helps things stick.\n\nAs for Kanji, I'd recommend picking up Remembering the Kanji if you can - it's three volumes of the roughly 3,000 most common kanji, with readings (volume 1 is the first 1500, volume 2 is the readings for volume 1, and volume 3 is the second 1500 plus readings).  They recommend the use of visual mnemonics for making the kanji stick, which autism may either help or hinder with depending on how vivid your visual imagination is.\n\nIn terms of making things stick generally, I thoroughly recommend anki - it's a flashcard app that uses spaced repetition to make sure that you don't tend to get the same card again until you're close to forgetting it.  There are custom decks for Remembering the Kanji which can be downloaded.  Having said that, I would also advise creating a deck of your own cards, with sentence prompts in English, and the answer written entirely in kana (or, when you've had more luck getting kanji to stick, a mix of kanji and kana).\n\nKanji is tough - it wasn't designed for a language like Japanese, and as I understand it, the advent of smartphones has made it so that many people in Japan forget how to write a lot of kanji through lack of use, and just use kana for their handwriting.\n\nIn terms of anime, I assume you're familiar with the different groups of regular verbs (iru, eru and so forth) and how the verbs get their -masu endings?  If so, I would suggest lowering your sights a little and going for some stuff aimed more at preteens - naruto, one piece, pokemon, and so on.  Shows aimed at that demographic don't tend to use the polite register of Japanese that tends to be taught in most classes and online resources; instead, they go for a more informal register (more commonly used by children), which uses the base versions of verbs (such as ja nai instead of dewa arimasen, or aru instead of arimasu and so on) instead.  This means that it'll take a while to get used to, but as you learn to recognise the verbs in speech, it'll get easier to recognise them in a more polite register as well.  Then, you'll hopefully have an easier time with the more adult anime, which tends to mix registers far more.  Slice of life anime is a good option for this as well, since it tends to incorporate more everyday language than setting specific.\n\nLast but by no means least, please remember that as I said before, the language is a collection of skills - which means that some of them are less important than others depending on your goals.  If you don't intend to handwrite Japanese on a regular basis, then it's actually OK to only be able to read kanji, and not remember how to write them: most Japanese input methods involve typing in romaji which gets transliterated into kana and kanji anyway, or on a smart phone you might type in kana and get that transliterated into kanji.  Japanese is a harder language for English speakers to learn than most others simply because of how different its registers of speech are.  Where a polite and professional register in English merely requires one to pronounce all the words completely and to add please and thank you where necessary, in Japanese it changes pretty much every verb.  It is OK to struggle with this.  Learning is most easily done while relaxed.  If studying the language has become a stressful experience, then the stress is getting in the way of learning - in which case, I'll repeat my earlier suggestion that you take a break for a month or two, then return to your studies.\n\nBest of luck, and please try not to get too pissed off at yourself.  Don't beat yourself up for mistakes, because mistakes are how you learn.  Do try to find a way to use the language outside of learning it, because use is what will ultimately make it stick.", "created_utc": "1578736980.0", "edited": "False", "id": "fdupthe", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_en4wpc", "parent_id": "t1_fdugeuv", "score": "1", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "hectorgrey123", "body": "The most practical language to learn is the one you'll use.

Most people would never willingly choose\nto be a villain; to openly identify themselves as evil.  But then,\nmost people aren't me.\n\nIt all started with the release of what was quite possibly the most\nimmersive MMO the world has ever seen; a VR game with perma-death (but\nwith in-game methods to bring a character back from the dead - for a\nprice), where the economy was entirely player driven, and where there\nwere dungeons full of treasure for the taking - if you were willing to\nrisk losing your character in the process.\n\nI was among the first players.  The dungeons were fairly samey back\nthen; you'd go in, kill a bunch of monsters, and take their stuff.\nMaybe there would be a few traps.  People didn't play for the variety\nof monsters; they played for the experience of feeling like they were\ndeep underground, and for the many and vaaried social interactions the\ngame allowed for.\n\nMany played as shop keepers; escaping from their dead end jobs into\nthe fantasy of a peaceful life in which they were in control.  Yet\nmore played as bandits; choosing to take their wealth from merchants\nand exhausted adventurers rather than earning it themselves.\n\nI'm something of a traditionalist, so I went with adventurer to begin\nwith.  After a while, however, entering dungeon after dungeon became\nstale.  As such, I turned to banditry; picking fights with groups of\nadventurers or well guarded merchant caravans.  In time, I even tried\nmy hand at being a merchant myself.  It's safe to say that I have\nexperienced every aspect of this game in a way that very few have -\nand yet I still craved more.\n\nThe email I received last year came as something of a surprise.  The\ndevelopers had an idea to improve the game - uploading the minds of\nveteran players for use as persistent NPCs.  Some would be villains;\nsome would be mentors; and some would even just be comic relief.  In\nthe game, we would be immortal.  In the real world, unfortunately, the\nprocess requires so much power that it kills the body.  It wasn't a\ndifficult choice; factory work for minimum wage vs immortality, a life\nof luxury, and the opportunity to give people joy - albeit in a\nroundabout way.\n\nIt struck me then as it does now that villainy is a difficult job to\ndo well in the context of a game.  It's a job that I ultimately don't\ntrust some of the griefers and other assorted bell-ends to do justice.\nIt's easy to be an arsehole; what's difficult is being an arsehole in\nsuch a way that you improve the experience of those who interact with\nyou.\n\nI could send my most powerful goons to kill beginning players - that\nwould be smart, but it wouldn't be fun for them.  So instead, I send\ngoons with a small but realistic chance of victory - I want it to be a\nchallenge, but I don't want to overwhelm them.  Likewise I have plans\nthat will succeed if allowed to, but that have flaws that the players\ncan find if they're paying attention.  I laugh and gloat in front of\nbeaten enemies in order to give them a chance to pull victory from the\njaws of defeat, and my evil laugh is coming along quite nicely.\n\nSo far as those playing the game are concerned, I am evil.  I am a\ncomplete arsehole that many are truly fortunate to have escaped from\nwith their lives.  I am a constant threat, against which vigilance is\nkey.  And you know what?  I like it that way.\n\nSometimes I disguise myself as a random villager NPC to see for myself\nhow things are coming along.  The new players fear me; the veterans\nhate me - but all agree that the game would be boring without me.\nThen I reveal myself; let my foes have a good fight against my minions\nand I, and then escape when I feel like I'm losing.  I even bring a\nmix of minions, so that the newer players can feel like they're\nplaying an important role in ensuring the veterans don't get\noverwhelmed by numbers.\n\nI am, in short, a villain - and I take my job very seriously.

There are a bunch of tables with die modifiers for range, armour and stats, but it's really easy to create a \"to hit\" chart based on range and armour for basically any weapon you care about, and it's otherwise really easy to adjudicate.  A shotgun, for example, gets a +5 to hit against someone not wearing any armour and a +3 to hit someone at medium range.  As such, at that range you hit on a 5+ - or a 0+ if they're not wearing armour.  It's also worth noting that people get tired in melee combat - if you make more melee attacks than you have points of Endurance, you start taking penalties to hit.  You can, however, choose to take the penalty to a hit in order to not have it count against your limit.\n\nSkill use is far more akin to old school D&D and the like - in most instances, you don't roll skills; if you're trained, you succeed at what you wanted to do.  Also, when you pick up a skill for the first time, it starts at a 1.  Many skills that involve die rolls will give you a +2 to the roll for each level in the skill, meaning that even if you only get a skill once, you're going to succeed at the majority of tasks.  A skill at 0 is one that you've had enough basic training to at least attempt, and is generally given in skills that the party will need but didn't get the usual way.  Also, everybody has at least a 0 in all weapons, because you're heroes dammit!\n\nAttributes don't have bonuses or penalties based on level; individual rolls get bonuses or penalties if an attribute is above or below a certain level.  While this is less simple than in modern games, it is more flexible - if a task requires a mix of physical attributes (such as, for example, pulling oneself up into the rafters to avoid detection), you might say that it's a 9+ with a +2 for dexterity of at least 9, a +2 for strength of at least 9, and a -2 if endurance is 5 or lower.  The way this ties into combat is different for various weapons - a club requires a strength of 5, while your bare hands require a strength of 6 - but the penalty for being lower than that is a -4 for the club and only a -2 for your bare hands.\n\nChoosing your pre-adventuring career requires rolls based on attributes - getting into the marines is much harder than getting into the army (8+ compared to 5+), and where the marines require strength 8 for a +2 and intelligence 8 for a +1, the army only requires endurance 5 and dexterity 6 for those bonuses.  The draft, of course, is a straight d6 roll, landing you in the navy, the marines, the army, the scouts, the merchant marine, or \"other\".  Quite infamously, the survival roll at the end of a term of service is very literal in this edition of the game - if you fail, your character is dead and it's time to roll up a new one.  Trying to get a character with poor stats killed prior to play is a time honoured tradition, since stats are generated by 2d6 down the line.\n\nPersonally, I prefer Mongoose 1e, but not by very much - classic Traveller may be a product of its time (coming out around the same time as AD&D 1e), but it stands up very well.", "created_utc": "1574262011.0", "edited": "False", "id": "f84vyf4", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_dyvweh", "parent_id": "t1_f83u07o", "score": "4", "subreddit": "rpg", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh2s"}, {"author": "hectorgrey123", "body": "You're assuming that they'd double check the account name, in a relatively pale font (@cchq) when they see the display name in bold (factcheckUK).", "created_utc": "1574249953.0", "edited": "False", "id": "f84ickz", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_dysqxc", "parent_id": "t1_f84d7px", "score": "1", "subreddit": "ukpolitics", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhcv"}, {"author": "hectorgrey123", "body": "Personally, I'm fine with house rules on the proviso that the GM brings them up with the rest of the group first.

There are more choices, but the choices are far more limited compared to Pathfinder 1e; with pretty much everything gated by level.\n\nHaving said that, Pathfinder 2e won't have rules for creating NPCs or monsters until the Gamemastery Guide comes out next year - I have to be honest, I would have thought that book would be higher priority than a second bestiary, given that some of us would like to add some human opponents without basically creating PCs...", "created_utc": "1573517303.0", "edited": "False", "id": "f79yio8", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_duud8c", "parent_id": "t3_duud8c", "score": "1", "subreddit": "rpg", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh2s"}, {"author": "hectorgrey123", "body": "The only ones I've ever met who didn't only invest in property also owned hotels, for which they were pretty terrible bosses too.", "created_utc": "1573174530.0", "edited": "False", "id": "f6v21jt", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_dm1g53", "parent_id": "t1_f6v1ovo", "score": "3", "subreddit": "LandlordLove", "subreddit_id": "t5_26tm5u"}, {"author": "hectorgrey123", "body": "Personally, I'd probably suggest something based on Chronicles of Darkness (i.e. New WOD 2e), simply because the most easily available books are actually intended for beginners to the system rather than people who've been playing for decades already.

The hunger mechanics are particularly good; instead of having a pool of blood points, you gradually become more hungry, and the hunger makes you more likely to lose control (for example, if you just meant to beat someone unconscious, but your hunger dice give you a critical success, you might just beat them into paste, with all the consequences that entails).

If you're roughly a beginner, then [Say Something In Spanish](https://www.saysomethingin.com/spanish) is really good - it focuses on spoken production right from the start, has spaced repitition built directly into the course, and focuses on the kind of grammar you see in everyday conversation.  It can get you to around A2/B1-ish in roughly three months of half an hour per day, with a really, really good foundation for further learning.  I believe the first five lessons (each of which is roughly 30 minutes) are still free; the remainder are sold in batches of 10.\n\nThe main weakness of the course, however, is the lack of reading and writing.  The intention is that you learn to speak and to understand before you start worrying about reading and writing in order to make sure that you base your pronunciation of the various sounds on what you hear instead of what you see (for that reason, I'd recommend using the audio only option for the lessons rather than the video, but it's up to you).  That said, I understand that Spanish spelling is relatively phonetic, and each lesson has a vocabulary list for everything introduced in that lesson - learning to read and write Spanish, assuming you want to, is much easier once you've got a good grasp of the phonetics.\n\nI used their course for Welsh, and while my vocabulary wasn't great, my accent, pronunciation, and use of grammar were all good enough that I would sometimes be mistaken for either a native speaker or a very advanced learner.
