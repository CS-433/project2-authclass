Between Plaza Espa\u00f1a and Valencia Nord is a mini chinatown (great food) and in Ruzafa is where most of the foreigners seem to reside, so you might have better luck renting there, although the connection between [the new metro line to the other lines](https://cadenaser.com/resizer/rKZxtw9Khfs4Nz9ssVixFopZnEo=/736x736/filters:format(jpg):quality(70):focal(975x1494:985x1504)/cloudfront-eu-central-1.images.arcpublishing.com/prisaradio/FB5U2L4W35AMJF5NGT7TSETQVA.jpg) is through walking, that's the only sacrifice you'd have to make.  I don't recommend living to the south of Av. Peris i Valero, less convenient and a bit more \"citylike\" and less beautiful in my opinion. \n\nAngel guimera is the most convenient metro stop but the neighborhood is mostly residential and busier, it will be expensive but isn't a bad area. Up by Turia/Campanar/Beniferri is nicer but becomes less convenient as you stray from the center, same with Jesus to Torrent areas (although more residential and a bit less green). Empalme and farther out on lines 1-2 are nice but do not live there unless you decide to get a vehicle/already have a license or will be going to work/school farther out. \n\nArrancapins is a good neighborhood to live in, has a lot of that old style look though and might not be as renovated. Lots of convenient things around. X\u00e1tiva to Col\u00f3n is the shopping district and will always be very noisy, but if you like having the mall and (slightly overpriced) shops and restaurants nearby you will be happy. \n\nAlameda to Marit\u00edm Serreria tends to be where most uni students reside and will be cheaper even if it is farther out, you will have lots of events and people to meet there.  Past Maritim are a few trams but they will always be jam packed and once it's not beach season it's kind of dead, wouldn't recommend living by the beach (the nicer beaches are  out of the city and better for visits). Facultats has a lot of healthcare related visitors and residents (doctors, nurses, etc.) on top of being part of the Uni zone and is closer than Alameda-Maritin to greenery and the center, so is more convenient if you prefer being closer to the center. Benimaclet is hipster central and is nice for an edgier or more cozy vibes, any further up however is pretty out of the city.\n\nI don't have any opinions and really never go towards Av. del cid or further out in that direction.", "created_utc": "1666905777.0", "edited": "1666906859.0", "id": "iu1ixax", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_yf1aiy", "parent_id": "t3_yf1aiy", "score": "3", "subreddit": "valencia", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qn44"}, {"author": "Anodynic", "body": "Yes, landlords here want more information than the government requires to extend a residency permit.

Even after everything, when I had to leave to take care of my mom with cancer in my home country, he was back to his infidelity and I caught it. I just knew I had to finally leave him. It was hard, because in many other ways he was an excellent man who provided for me and would've made a wonderful father in the future, but he was just serially unfaithful. It still hurts to this day and it was clear when we broke up that he was never expecting me to leave him. I just knew that in spite of everything we'd been through, there was no way I could have self-respect within that relationship. He would never change, and his cheating was always something that existed well before me in relationships, so it wasn't my problem.\n\nI blew it up after 5 years together and wrote a public statement to ensure not only that we'd never get back together, however to hopefully see if his friends/family can help him seek help so that by the time another girl rolls around he treats her well. His sister (who is like 13 years older and helped him hide it because she's *also* a serial cheater and apparently only stopped when it happened to her by her kid's dad) sent a scathing text at me that nobody else needed to know, blah blah blah.

We had a class all about bioethics, and while the adopted POV was that of the Catholic church, we were encouraged to argue and express ourselves.

A lot of what we do is arguing our point; we have a student \u201ccongress\u201d and our final project (TFG) which requires you to express yourself and your work to an entire panel.\n\nPharmacology is almost entirely clinical cases where you have to argue what treatments are acceptable/unacceptable, alternatives and why. For example, one (easy) question we had in a large clinical case was about whether or not to give anxiolytics prior to surgery. I said no as it was unnecessary to add a further medication especially as preop anxiety is normal, many said yes and argued their stance as well, there was no \u201cright\u201d answer only people who argued their case well. A large part of our degree does involve ethics & creativity (green chemistry, toxicology testing involving less animals, etc) and also at least in chemistry and medicine it is rare to only have one route/option available. Like if you need to make a compound there are many routes to choose from, and often what theoretically is easier realistically isn\u2019t used (economic constraints, volatility of certain compounds, etc.). A large part of research is genuinely just arguing and communicating why it is important and how it works. \n\nI believe I understand the point you were trying to make but you were incorrect in your assumptions; and all STEM fields involve a large amount of discourse and dissent. My University has people from all walks of life as it is quite international so of course you are surrounded by passionate people with their own views and morals; would you sell an abortion pill? Assisted euthanasia pill? When does life begin? Is it ethical to use animals? Vaccines & combatting misinformation. Etc. etc. etc. I have never been judged or publicly ridiculed by a professor however. \n\nSo while I heavily disagree with the first assumptions you made, I will say you are right, your degree doesn\u2019t necesssarily reflect on your intelligence, in that there are intelligent people with all sorts of degrees, although I\u2019d be hard pressed to find an unintelligent astrophysicist, lol.

Another top student in class used to be a law student but decided it was awful. The truth of the matter is many people who go into scientific fields have scientific families, about 85% of my classmates already have a pharmacy to go in their family to when they graduate, or are children of doctors.

Didn't end the affair/inappropriate sexual behavior, he got caught. He also kept trying, just covering his tracks better. He even did it while I was LDR to take care of a parent who was diagnosed with cancer, after I genuinely thought he truly couldn't get any lower.\n2. He didn't confess, ever, always trickle truthed. Still doesn't even think he cheated, caught that one in one of our fights a year out, went from remorseful to \"I didn't cheat on you.\" My face was like pure shock although he took it back but justified that it wasn't that bad. Cheaters really have a way of deluding themselves and lying. Your husband already is doing this and I guarantee if you continue down this path he is going to just end with \"it wasn't even cheating just a mistake\" type responses. When I finally left him I just told him I knew and dumped him, didn't even listen to his excuses because that's all they are, lies and excuses. And in the end my ex's biggest concern wasn't that he cheated, lied and hurt me even at such a difficult moment in my life, his first comment when I was leaving him was \"you really made me wait all this time just to break up with me?\" aka he could've been out boning other people rather than waiting until my final exams were over, just purely selfish thoughts. It's intrinsic and inherent to their thought process, pure selfishness. OP, your husband will never give you the closure verbally that you are looking for, so I recommend not trying to wait around wondering for the why. The why is that he's a cheater, it's not mysterious or special, just sad and pathetic on his part.\n3. Wasn't accepting of the blame and dares insinuate you are the reason for his actions, as though communication, honesty, or leaving wasn't an option, lol. In reality it's probably due to low self esteem, being selfish, having a sex addiction, enjoying the thrill, seeking validation by opposite sex attention, having zero self worth outside of perceived attraction by the opposite sex, etc. OP, you are not why he cheated.\n4. Wasn't interested in doing whatever to gain back trust, only the things he thought were okay. He begrudgingly took me to couples therapy, complained each time, and never ever took initiative.+\n\nAll of these are signs that your husband just doesn't care and isn't a good partner, regardless of any other qualities he may have that speak to his character outside of a relationship.

It takes a bit longer to arrive  but there's always trains to and from, it's a beautiful town with cheaper prices, has a lovely beach that you can access by bike or by bus (I think even by train, too) and is a town that is quiet enough for families, has lots of foreigners, and is rich with history.\n\nNow, let's say you say no, Gandia is too far South, okay let me move up the train line. The next relevant town is Tavernes de la Valldigna, it is boring, it has it's own beach but is slightly more difficult to arrive to as the train arrives when the bus to the beach leaves (not even kidding) and the train station isn't a walkable distance from the town, it connects to a highway which then takes you to the town. In Gandia, however, Renfe is in the city center, so you can walk pretty much anywhere you need to go (apartment included) which is more friendly to your public-accessible lifestyle. I do not drive either and I've never felt the need for driving in Gandia.\n\nUp the line more and you have Cullera. Again, it's an interesting little tourist town, but still a bit far to make it slightly unreasonable to go to Valencia for anything more than a lunch (as anything but an early dinner would make it too late to get back, most trains are closed down during the night with last trains before midnight). It is smaller than Gandia, so you will likely be a bit bored there although perhaps you won't mind. Since you already would only be going to Valencia for planned day trips, it only takes off about 15 minutes from your train ride to live in Cullera in comparison to Gandia. That said, in Gandia you actually have things to do in the town, the beach is accessible and large, AND you can still arrive in Valencia, planned, within a little over an hour from Gandia (55 min on the train itself).\n\nLater you have Sueca, which I dunno about the accessibility to the beach or anything about the town but it's a bit farther inland, as with the other towns on that train line, which other people can tell you about better. If you didn't choose Gandia or Cullera, I'd say look north, as those towns are much closer to the beach. I personally love visiting Sagunto, and think it is probably like the \"gandia of the north\" as it is it's own city with many interesting things to do and easy access to Valencia by train. I looked on renfe (trains) and it says it's about 27-33 minutes, and renfe (cercanias, probably cheaper) is about 37 minutes from the city, so it's probably the perfect place to want to live, with somewhere like Pu\u00e7ol probably being somewhere affordable and quaint if you want a smaller town, with a train connecting it to both Sagunto AND Valencia.\n\nSo my final vote is: South (Gandia or Cullera); North (Sagunto or Pu\u00e7ol)", "created_utc": "1625913849.0", "edited": "1625914213.0", "id": "h4otss3", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_ohc598", "parent_id": "t3_ohc598", "score": "11", "subreddit": "valencia", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qn44"}, {"author": "Anodynic", "body": "NTA, definitely do not buy him a new phone although do consider taking the gift back entirely, returning it, and spending that money on yourself instead.

When is the last time you've just randomly openly complained. Fk the virus, Fk the economy, Fk that exam, Fk work, etc. do you do this with friends or are you just kind of like \"oh that's okay\" and agreeable because you feel like you need to be? Do you assert yourself in conversations? Have you just become known as the shy one? Do you laugh at people's jokes loudly? Do you accept invites to go out? How often is \"being there\" in person, physically, with said person? Do you feel comfortable telling your friends you love them?   \n\n\nHalf of it sounds like you're not asserting yourself and the other half sounds like you don't know how to ask for/seek out what you need. Why would you ever put some random person's thoughts and feelings above yours? Why do you feel like Jessica from across the hall's problems are more important than yours? \n\nI'm asking a lot of questions but they're not hypothetical, if you're comfortable absolutely do answer and I can give you specific advice. But it sounds like to me that you need to start asserting yourself and taking care of yourself. Nobody knows how severe problems are or how you feel unless you open up.

But in day to day life you could get by on your English alone 100%. Being fluent in English and Italian and knowing a lot of Spanish means your life will be hella easy tbh. \n\n>  am I going to struggle to fit in, or be accepted? \n\nIf you generally struggle in Italian society then probably yeah but honestly dude there are people of all sorts here and everyone's really friendly and open and chill. It's all about the situations you put yourself into as well, I spent my first two years in Spain basically shut in except when I met my ex boyfriend and even then felt isolated by the language barrier as my ex was hella borde and spoke a lot of Valencian. Then I came back after 8 months in London, joined Uni, did a few meetups on [meetup.com](https://meetup.com) and I'm extremely social now, hundreds of whatsapp threads a week, in multiple clubs, was elected class president, joined red cross, basically a totally different life than my first 2 years shut in. I highly recommend forcing yourself initially to meet people and go out a bit, so you are able to find commonminded friends who enjoy chilling with you. Obviously at 36 your social groups would be more work oriented but honestly that's like the best age here in Valencia in your 30s-40s, most meetups are in the 30s-50s range.\n\n>Job market IT sector?\n\nDue to the polit\u00e9cnica and other unis there is a surprising amount of tech jobs here.

It's meaningless virtue signaling.\n\nDo you sew? I do, I understand the value and stress that goes into it. Are you a man? You sound like it, which means you have zero room to comment on her emotional state or reactions. Also it's rich that someone is insulting me and a sub I go to when one of their recent comments is calling women \"pussy-whipped\" and who frequents tumblr in action. If you actually listened to women you'd see it's not femcel at all rather feminist, although men like you are not welcome. \n\nHow about letting the OP express her frustrations online and then giving actual advice, rather than try to attack me for finding it ridiculous that people are policing OP's comments here. \n\nHere OP, here's my advice: don't make a gift for someone who doesn't appreciate you. Tell him how you feel and communicate in no uncertain terms that he is being ridiculous and hurtful, and you will not continue on with this project if this is going to be his attitude. No new muslin. No just trying to do it without his measurements or knowing how it fits. Unless he sincerely apologizes and tries it on, he's unwelcome when it comes to your sewing talents. When you feel frustrated like that, to avoid unnecessary judgment from people who may want to make you feel bad for expressing not only understandable but normal frustration at the situation, try journaling. Also try confiding in proper friends (which according to your OP it looks like you have) rather than preaching to a fairly sexist and generally male oriented audience who will relish in finding whatever issue they can with you as you have actual standards for your partner. And lastly, stop cleaning up after him. \n\nIt sounds like in your post you have multiple small issues, such as his hairs on the toilet seat, and him whining a lot. This should be dealt with separately, having him clean up after himself and communicating about making a more positive environment especially in the state we're in and that whining constantly is annoying. And also reconsider whether or not this is a small issue which you needed to vent about or an issue that demonstrates a larger problem, whether you're even happy or compatible together. I have no idea about your relationship beside this problem so I cannot decide this, but it could be the case of an excellent match being stupid and annoying ultimately, or it could be the case of a poor match slowly but surely coming to light. Regardless, the onus is on him to make the next move, right now completely stop investing your time and emotional energy and artistic talents and gifts on someone who doesn't appreciate you. And please don't allow yourself to be beaten down by white knights for him just because saying chopping off his member offends sexists who use words like \"pussy whipped\", pick mes, and people who are here to judge rather than to dole out actual advice.

Don't take relationship advice from men, they do not have what's in your best interests.\n\n\"Don't be jealous\" as though your reactions/feelings to the situation are because of you and not because of your boyfriend inappropriately tolerating things that should not be ocurring at all. \n\n\"Be proud\" What is there to be proud of? Having a man who doesn't respect you enough to listen and to tell his friends to shut up with their comments or f out of his life? Having a man who happily parrots this crap to you so that you can feel worse? Having a man who doesn't defend your relationship, is inappropriate with other women who 100% aren't even interested in him and who crosses boundaries? Yay, so proud.\n\n\"But you\u2019re the one he\u2019s chosen to be with. That\u2019s a good thing, not something to be upset about.\" He is not the prize, you are. Choose yourself first. If a man makes you feel shitty and doesn't treat you right, leave. You are the one who chooses. You're not his consolation prize. \n\n\"It doesn't matter if she has a crush,  he can\u2019t control that\" true, although he can cut off the comments, stop fueling this problem when he doesn't have any intent of changing his communication, he can be more respectful of your relationships, he can do a lot of things, instead he's choosing to go you have nothing to worry about baby while loling at his friends blowing up all microinteractions between him and this classmate into her being ferociously in love (and I guarantee you most people are not this interested in their partner's love life, how many comments of these come from said \"friends\" to you? Does he just parrot it to you or let them disrespect you to your face? Both are terrible.\n\n> being jealous and possessive is NOT a quality most guys find attractive.  \n\nUgh this is so stupid. As though it matters what guys find attractive, the only thing focusing on male attraction does is distract you from more important matters. A guy that is right will love you as is and will treat the relationship with so much respect that you never have cause to be jealous. Jealousy doesn't just happen without cause. I hate when men try to blame it on \"women are so crazy and jealous and possessive it's like soo unsexy\" when literally all of it is caused by men being disrespectful or terrible partners. Women aren't born jealous, they're made to feel that way through disrespect. It's not a personality trait nor a bad habit, rather a normal, natural, healthy reaction to some asshole treating you terribly. How's that for apples? \n\n>  great, attractive bf \n\nHe doesn't sound great or attractive at all to me but wow men really do love to take the bare minimum from other men and boost it up.\n\n>  other people are jealous of YOU for \n\nNot a single action or written word by this girl has given you any reason at all to believe that she has a crush on him. The entire issue is caused by your boyfriend's lack of boundaries and his friends being consistently shitty to you and your relationship. That is it. Her writing \"LOL should I do this reading?\" is not flirting at all. The level of manipulation they've done to drive you into this false competition makes me sick.\n\n> be glad that you have him around. \n\nGirl I guarantee you if you dumped him you would be devastated for like two weeks, then it'd feel like an enormous weight off your shoulders, you'd realize you feel a lot better, suddenly whatever \"jealousy\" is away as you notice that you're not sitting there obsessive over other women, suddenly you don't need the therapy that previously seemed so urgent, suddenly not having the money for therapy isn't an issue, suddenly life looks a lot brighter, suddenly you realize how pathetic their obsessing over her every word and interaction is, and suddenly you realize that you are worth so much more than this. And then comes the attention from men, and the realization that only the most insecure, terrible, and ugly partners strive to bring their partner down rather than lift them up. And after working on yourself by engaging in hobbies and not focusing on irrelevant subjects like \"is Melyssa blinking too flirtatiously at my no value ex boyfriend\" you'll feel even better. And once you enter into a healthy relationship a lightbulb will come off, where you finally realize that you were never jealous just in an unhealthy, toxic relationship with a man who dragged you down and pushed you into horrible emotions that would never occur if he was a better partner or cared for you.\n\n> which is the exact opposite of what you\u2019re trying to achieve here.  \n\nI don't know why suddenly some dude with shitty friends is being treated as the one you have to chase, but newsflash, regardless of what men would like to propagate, YOU are the prize.

Again, in a relationship, even with a lot of attractive people around, if you have a secure relationship this is never an issue. \n\n> he does not think she likes him and if she showed any signs he would just stop talking to her and never disrespect me.  \n\nHe is definitely sharing a half truth here in that he doesn't think she likes him, but he lied about the rest as he is actively disrespecting you and recruiting his friends in the process. He is saying this to try to get a reaction and to get you to \"control\" him so that he has a reason to complain about you being crazy and controlling. If you think you have to intervene for something like this, he is not a good partner. Good partners know how to handle these situations, or at least seek guidance from you with how to proceed when they know it's causing discord.\n\n> he might not actually know if she likes him and he is just feeding into her \"crush\" \n\nHe definitely knows she doesn't like him otherwise he would have said it because he is feeding into whatever crazy bullshit his actions are saying and his friends are spewing to try to boost his ego and make you feel insecure. It's funny how he calls you his wife and claims you're married without doing literally any actions to back it and actively disrespects you and stays friends with disrespectful people. Very \"husbandly\" of him.\n\n> I can't ask him to stop talking to her \n\nYou shouldn't have to ask. Talk to him about the issue, let him know that his friends comments are inappropriate, that you're exhausted with having this discussion and he needs to fix it. That this girl clearly doesn't have an interest in him beyond being classmates, and even if she does, it's not your problem and needs to stop becoming a \"thing\" because it's annoying and you have better things to do.\n\nHere's the thing, in the relationship, YOU are the prize. The reason so many men are terrible partners is because women tolerate bullshit like this rather than just walking away (and only decide to leave when they get pregnant and asshole genetics are already passed down, dooming the planet further to a generation of terrible men). You don't have a jealousy problem, you don't have a Melyssa problem, you have a boyfriend problem. Change your mindset. Either Melyssa doesn't care about him and only sees him as a classmate/acquaintance, or she's an enormous pickme who is so desperate for attention that she's chasing taken men.

I don't think they deserve to be objectified. But I also think trying to psychoanalyze a tiktok video is trying to tackle the bigger problem of sexualization and objectification from the apple that has fallen very far from the problematic pornography/sexualized culture tree, rolled around a bit, and turned into a soccer ball (trendy dance to raunchy song done by hundreds of thousands online generally with friends/family and in not sexy clothes usually with a comedic element).\n\nI try to tackle male gaze by participating in fight the new drug and other movements, I don't ever validate objectification or tear down women on the internet and won't ever try to solve the entirely MALE problem by trying to police innocent women's behavior first. And I don't understand the point of the OP's video.\n\nOkay, so let's say even if a woman is a hypocrite, and? She shakes her ass and says don't objectify me. That still doesn't mean she deserves the objectification. That still doesn't make her responsible for any cat calling or disrespect she receives from men. And I think it's different someone participating in pornography, bdsm, kink, vs a sexualized dance. Is it better that people dance to something not sexual? Sure! But I think the sexualized dance trends are more of an overlap of regular things (like dancing) trending poorly, bu**t I definitely don't think that these people are a step away from pornography** and I think that trying to fight the male gaze, objectification, and the pornography industry by degrading/demeaning teens and 20 somethings seeing a video/dance/comedy skit and trying to repeat it for laughs is ineffective at best and focusing on a symptom of the problem rather than the problem itself (men, the male gaze, an overly sexualized culture, etc.).\n\nI feel like either she was trying to teach or tear women down, and if she was trying to teach it was done in a mean, ineffective, and unenlightened manner. Insulting the people you're trying to reach out to or impact is generally ineffective at best and counterintuitive at worst.\n\nTl;dr I think this discussion is overlapping way too much with pornography when out of all of the pornographic like content on the internet, these are very innocuous and most can barely be considered \"sexually suggestive.\" And I do not understand why you, and bubbles responded to my comment with analogies to pornography. These videos are not pornography and I have never seen one that could be considered softcore pornography on my feed, ever, and I cannot sexualize any of these videos especially the ones I linked (notice the millions of likes/views showing that they are the most liked). I hate that something fun with a mildly problematic background is being likened to something as offensive as pornography and used as a justification to bully other women on the internet.", "created_utc": "1605300863.0", "edited": "1605301396.0", "id": "gc6tzm0", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_jtm2lf", "parent_id": "t1_gc6q5p0", "score": "-5", "subreddit": "FemaleDatingStrategy", "subreddit_id": "t5_xaiot"}, {"author": "Anodynic", "body": "You don't know anything about me and clearly don't know anything about tiktok and your comment with woke outrage against what is honestly mostly young adults trying out comedic skits or having a laugh with friends is ridiculous to me. \n\nRather than against stuff **that actually matters** such as sex trafficking, sex work, pornography, kinks, the bdsm \"community\", degradation and abuse of women, men taking advantage of women in relationships, women staying in abusive relationships, sexism, gaslighting, literally anything, you're on about how the 20 somethings in sweats doing a giggle clip with their friend deserve to be objectified by nasty NVM/LVM because they're asking for the objectification.\n\nWomen. Are. Never. Objects. And doing these dances isn't doing anything to take away from safety or livability of other women. But you know what isn't female empowerment? Calling women hypocrites the moment they do a video clip or skit mildly sexual and implying they deserve creepy male objetification. That definitely does not improve safety or livability for women.

I don't do it because I'm not comfortable with dressing skimpily but I definitely don't think anyone who dresses skimpily or dances sexily deserves objectification. Normally these trends become trendy due to comedy, most people aren't actually trying to be sexy with these rather make a \"skit\" for giggles. And posting a video of you doing a fun dance or silly skit onto your own social media page even if it's a twerk is not on the streets parading it around. \n\nMost people are in sweatpants when they do it too, but I have a curated tiktok feed that's mostly comedic. If people use tiktok sexually they will see mostly sexual people, but again, as a 23 year old woman who finds comedy in it and actually uses tiktok a lot, most of these are \"sexual\" dances but not even that sexual, just for fun or to get a laugh or to surprise parents or something stupid like that, or to make an *actual skit with the partner they already have because they mutually enjoy it.*\n\n>I've seen videos of porn stars walking around cities half naked for *fun* is that right?\n\nIt's not the same.

The OP didn't complain once, by the way, she infact was positive with him multiple times (I appreciate him, at least he tried..) even though he didn't do a single competent task. \n\nNot everyone is a great cook, but most people are willing to recognize their setbacks and at least try to improve or forge alternatives. If heating up some campbells chicken noodle   \nin a bowl from the microwave is the best you can cook, it's better than just bringing a sad package of hotdogs and potato salad. My mom doesn't like cooking and eats prepared food almost every day of the week but if one of us was sick she'd heat tomato soup and make grilled cheese, bring some plain cereals, make hotdogs (bun and condiments), make quesadillas, heat soups, heat up frozen foods, etc. It was almost entirely assemble and/or heat but you know what it was excellent and above and beyond. There is no excuse to buy exactly 2 \"ready to eat\" things and fail on the assembly and heating. It's literally eating from a bucket with the spoon, the potato salad, and probably eating from a sad hotdog package. \n\nYou're saying you're sure it didn't happen but why do you not believe her, even if she was using hyperbole, it's still ridiculous. You're right that there are so many foods between hot dogs and a proper homemade meal (although I consider hot dogs easily incorporable into this category with effort) which is all the more why it is so ridiculous and LV of her partner to not even be capable of fixing her a bowl of cereals. How is his lack of cooking/heating up/assembling food on her? When you are sick do people not properly take care of you? You can literally buy precooked salad chicken, chicken broth, and thin thin noodles, put them together in a pot on the stove and bam, a proper homemade meal, especially with toast or crackers on the side...that requires 0 cooking knowledge, 0 effort, impossible to burn due to the high water content and literally only is heating and assembly (putting the crackers on the side). \n\nOverall I am worried about your downplaying of the situation, I hope you are being taken care of properly when you are sick. Please take care of yourself and if you are with someone and sick and they don't know how to make you a meal, tell them the chicken noodle soup \"recipe\" i just said. Or a grilled cheese/tomato soup (heated up from can). Or canned soup (lentils with veggies are great). Or pancakes from a mix. Or boxed mac n cheese (follow box instructions). Or a regular sandwich (wheat/cheese/ham/mayo/mustard/greens). Or a bagel (cream cheese optional, they can hand you the philadelphia with a butter knife). Or a hotdog on a toasted bun (some butter in the pan) topped with shredded cheese, cooked bacon, onions (you can buy small canned already caramelized onions in all stores, all it needs is heating even in the microwave), condiments..  There are just so many foods that are so simple to make it's hardly considered cooking... There is no excuse for an adult not to know how to do these things or not to be able to learn once told.

You don't have to be a master chef to know how to make basic meals in the house, and it should be a basic thing for all humans to know how to eat a regular meal.

How does she know this? Just because he says he regrets it and doesn't share it doesn't mean he doesn't think about it or still watch it. This is the thing, do you think people especially people who have expressed interest in such degenerate fantasies and who watch degrading pornography go around mentioning it to their loved ones and partners? Especially ones who are already insecure or hurt by past behavior? How many people do you see on here all the time hiding it or lying. It's more normal to hide the porn use than to be openly sharing your viewing habits. You're absolutely kidding yourself if you think OP actually knows the extent of his addiction or if you think he'd willingly admit things like \"I watched CP.\"\n\n> implying that the BF is no longer an addict \n\nWe literally do not know whether he still consumes it or not, but once an addict, always an addict. This is why actually recovered alcoholics don't call themselves former alcoholics, they will go \"I've been x days/months/years sober\" but they know they're an addict and can't safely consume alcohol in moderation.\n\n> He also said he didn't look at CP, which makes him not a pedo. \n\nOkay, this seems to be the main basis of your argument. Here is my perspective. He literally asks his partner to watch pornography with him and namedrops an artist. She did not formerly know this artist. Thus, he was watching pornography without her awareness. She is upset but doesn't really bring it up. He could still be jacking it every day and she would be none the wiser. She later looks up that artist and sees that they have abundant amounts of CP. Do you really think someone who would namedrop an artist as an example of something they wanted to look at would just conveniently skip the CP and \"only\" stick with the gore and rape? And once she reacts negatively do you really think he'd be like \"I didn't think it was a big deal\" or \"yeah I watched it\"? No, he already knows her reaction, of course he'd say \"oh I didn't mean it like that I totally definitely didn't see the CP that this artist is known for and draws in abundance I didn't mean it like that.\" A lot of your argument revolves on OP's partner being 110% honest with her, when the fact of the matter is that he clearly was not open with her from the beginning otherwise she would have known about all of his habits and that artist because he would have shared EVERY MOMENT he consumed pornography. Wait. that's unreasonable that he would tell her every single time especially when he clearly did it long enough to namedrop a favorite artist by surprise? Then do you *really think* that after this event he would suddenly advise her every time he consumed adult media? Bro.\n\n> . There is a reason that the law dictates \"innocent until proven guilty\" \n\nHe literally asked his girlfriend to have sex while watching this artist's content. This artist's content is CP, gore, and rape. How are you not seeing the connection? EVEN IF he was REALLY honest and 100% had selective vision and only saw the other, HOW is rape and gore any better?\n\n> circumstantial, unconcrete evidence goes against the very foundations of society. \n\nHe literally name dropped the artist whose entire page is filled with degeneracy and asked to sell his girlfriend's body online for money. It is more of an assumption to consider him honest and innocent than it is to consider that maybe he was lying when he saw her negative reaction to what he proposed? \n\n> Imagine a young man who is interested in history and who finds the Third Reich very fascinating, does that make him a Nazi? No, it doesn't.\n\nWhat is your analogy here? What is your big checkmate moment that you were trying to bring here? \"Imagine a young man who is interested in pornography and finds this CP artist very interesting, does that make him a Pedophile?\" Yes, yes the fuck it does. He didn't just \"find it interesting\" either, he was actively consuming content enough to know the name, be a fan of the artist and namedrop it during sex with his girlfriend asking if she wanted to consume it with him. The analogy would be more on par with \"Imagine a young man who is interested in history, who read Mein Kampf, and felt he really agreed with it and recommended it to his girlfriend to read it together, does that make him a Nazi?\" \n\n> despite your best efforts to paint reality as a shitty, lifeless misery. \n\nWhy are you projecting so much on this women and on us other women here?

It's hard for me to explain it because it was a mix of different subtle factors but essentially boils down to male pandering, odd feminism, strangely sexualizing non-sexual things/interactions (although I do recognize she is an actress and does try to evoke a reaction/pique interest for her audience), and just... overall weird advice at times.

It's more like wanting cool girl praise rather than wanting to give the best possible advice to women. And I don't think she's super malicious about it, but I do think a lot of the advice is really not adequate for a lot of relationships, or just has this tone of superiority/if you don't agree you're an idiot.\n\nNotice how, while you may think \"well those are good points\" in her first video there isn't anything showing women's perspectives/arguments? Notice how it can only benefit men in the end and essentially reverses it as though the man is the \"prize\"?\n\nSecond video shows her crying about not getting the required kisses she was promised from a girl, being creeped out by a compliment and painting this hypothetical woman as \"desperate/cringey\" and being upset that she paid for a date and didn't get the fake \"let me get my wallet/\" or a thank you for the meal. Again, painting herself in a pandering and bad light...the kisses thing was ridiculous, she could have just mentioned it or left earlier but instead is upset that her date enjoys conversing with her, the \"cringe\" joke is a very common joke that isn't that cringey if you take it well, saying you see long term partner potential in someone by \"hearing wedding bells\" or \"thinking of buying a wedding dress\" already as a lighthearted joke compliment shouldn't freak you out especially if you're theoretically dating for a LTR, and the date thing was understandable in that one case as she wasn't the one who asked her out but using that as marketing for men about why 5050 is better just doesn't help any women.\n\nIt makes me question if it even happened or if it's just clickbait for her male audience to go \"she understands us! what a wonderful woman\" and for women to want to seek more of her advice since it goes against what would be better for most women but is presented as though it's \"obvious/logical\" advice. Her tone is just very cancel-culture-esque, if you know what I mean.\n\nAnd in her third video literally the first thing she shows is snooping on your partner's phone, as though other examples such as having low self esteem which come afterwards are not as important. Like yeah, because women ignoring their gut feelings and staying blind in a relationship is way more important than women loving themselves and not comparing...?? Of course the first thing shown has to be something that men complain about and that doesn't even really affect them especially if they have nothing to hide and are loyal.

I think that is also why she uses such inappropriate phrases (ej just being honest, tell it like is, not two faced) when they clearly don't apply to her, because she probably literally does not understand the nuances in social scenarios and what is appropriate or not, because she has literally zero emotion except relating to herself and her own survival.

Sorry girl but WTF is going on in your head?\n* Has a defeatest attitude and just honestly genuinely doesn't seem to like you or being with you or like himself.\n* He doesn't talk to anyone, have any hobbies, and is solely reliant on you for 100% of the emotional support and tasks.\n\nAlright I'm exhausted already, and by this point all you're talking about is being emotionally exhausted and \"a little frustrated\"? Girl! Your boyfriend is an abusive, manipulative MOOCH. You are literally being held down in every way by him except probably in the bedroom because I'm sure with his behavior you don't have very much of a healthy intimate life, correct me if I'm wrong. Your 19 year old fairly normal issues that you went to therapy on, took medication for, took self-responsibility for and have improved upon are nothing to excuse this grown ass loser beta male's response.\n\n>I'm beginning to wonder when enough is enough and if it will be too late by then?\n\nThree years ago was when enough was enough. Now is just an abusive relationship where you're feeding into it unhealthily and have totally turned into a complacent victim, and worse, an enabler. I know this is hard to hear and probably comes off like I am an asshole, but you need to hear it. All you are doing is enabling him. You teach people how to treat you, and thus far you've taught him to treat you as one would treat their debit card and a piece of gum on the bottom of their shoe. Why? Why did you accept even half of this behavior, and have tried to justify it away?\n\n>We've talked about our long term goals, future career aspirations, children, and even retirement.\n\nIf you build a future with him or worse, have children with him it would be a crime against humanity, full stop. When did the world turn into people staying with such terrible, awful partners. Natural selection used to mean that men like this would NOT reproduce, now it has men like this convincing women to do ALL of the roles of both partners in a relationship and also convincing you that it's your fault! So frustrating to see. I guarantee you pick 10 men from the street and 9 out of 10 of them would be much, much better partners.\n\n>he is such a fantastic partner and showed me what healthy love looks like\n\nI'm sorry but you're delusional. No, no he did not.\n\n>I also don't want to lose myself in this relationship\n\nYou're already lost in this relationship, especially considering your educational background and career field. You literally specialize in things of this nature and are so blinded by him and lost that you genuinely cannot see that it is abusive and you should have been out years ago.\n\n>I wonder if I'm overreacting? Am I being toxic in this relationship? Am I projecting my own views of mental health onto him?\n\nYou need a therapist. Why are you so worried about his mental health and never worried about yourself? You are literally advocating for a side that actively tears you down. Go to /r/femaledatingstrategy which is admittedly a \\~controversial\\~ sub (mostly because of men like that who actively take women like you and eat them alive and assume the worst, just as he has done.)\n\nYou have not listed one good quality about him in this entire OP. He is truly awful. His genes should not pass on. He deserves to be alone and miserable in life for his issues, and you deserve a partner like you: someone who talks, communicates, trusts, cares about their partner's feelings, takes a shower, isn't a drug addict, isn't a mooch, can hold a job, etc. I feel us women have this huge issue and that is that we go into relationships with people expecting them to change. He isn't going to change. This IS him. The person that he played before was not his real personality, and you should never stay in a relationship because you think you'd be happy with the person you WANT them to be, not the person they are. \n\nI honestly think you need to dump him and also go straight into therapy before trying to go for another relationship, because this is really bad.", "created_utc": "1601114331.0", "edited": "1601114613.0", "id": "g6nkojk", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_j03311", "parent_id": "t3_j03311", "score": "9", "subreddit": "relationship_advice", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r0cn"}, {"author": "Anodynic", "body": "Before thinking about cutting ties try to consider that they may be just afraid to broach the subject or caught up in their own excitement.

Breakups always suck and are sad, it\u2019s something that gets better over time. You already know he is a trash partner now, but you learned a lot from the relationship and what to avoid so it was a good lesson. Also just because he treated you poorly in the end doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t appreciate previous memories!! I had a long time where I was so upset over breakups I let it ruin the whole relationship memory but in reality the breakups were the best part because I was getting to a better me every time, and there were a lot of good memories in the end. So don\u2019t worry about the fact it was the first relationship and how much time was spent etc. The breakup happened, it sucks, but now bigger and better things are coming and in hindsight he has done you a favor. I say this just because I don\u2019t want you to feel that because it ended it was a waste of time or for nothing\u2014 you are so young and have your whole life ahead of you with much happier memories to come.\n\nThat said, for advice to you. My first word of wisdom is a reminder that no matter how adult you feel, your brain is still developing and shifting in drastic manners until ~25 years old. Do not worry about not having perfect relationships yet as this age is guaranteed to come with lessons and pain as well as happiness- so try to focus on enjoying yourself and being happy both single AND if you go into a new relationship. The \u201cif he doesn\u2019t propose after 1yr\u201d advice and similar is NOT directed at you/this age group, so don\u2019t worry about taking your time and things being more relaxed at this age. A lot of FDS stuff is something that may take time to understand based on age and that\u2019s perfectly fine; you are 17, it\u2019s okay to still be learning and making mistakes, it\u2019s part of growing and flourishing. So don\u2019t be too hard on yourself if you are struggling or feeling like a lot of stuff here is easier said than done. \n\nIt\u2019s important to try to find meaningful friendships and support systems that you trust and can lean on. As well as enjoying being with yourself, whether that is through reading or watching television or doing sports or whatever, once you become okay with doing things alone or with girlfriends it takes off a lot of the desperation to enter into a new relationship. Part of this also means to stop checking on your ex and maybe even distance yourself from those \u201cmutual friends\u201d who still hang out with him. While a lot of these things can be complicated due to high school and having to sort of be with the same people every day, good friends will not be hanging out with your trash ex in their free time and won\u2019t update you on their life. Knowing about what he is doing won\u2019t help, but also I guarantee you that you are imagining him and his life MUCH happier and more glamorous than it is.\n\nLastly, for some dating advice from someone who loves relationships. Don\u2019t tell new guys about the trauma you experienced either from your ex or from the assault. Trauma bonding is a real thing and creates a rushed and false sense of empathy, many teenagers do not have the emotional capacity or experience to properly understand and empathize, and it doesn\u2019t benefit the new relationship being so raw, brings more risk than reward. I recommend talking things through with a therapist or trusted friends and family, and separating romantic partners from that type of serious trauma until becoming serious with each other, and even then only if you feel comfortable. Another reason is that abusive and shitty men tend to flock to women who have had bad experiences and thus a cycle is formed. \u201cIt just didn\u2019t work out.\u201d \u201cHe changed and stopped treating me to the standard in which I am used to so we broke up.\u201d \u201cWe grew a lot over those two years and went our separate ways\u201d etc are all perfectly honest quips you can use to briefly mention why the former relationship ended and move on.\n\nDon\u2019t date significantly older men even if they are wealthy, it just isn\u2019t worth it. Stick to 2-3 years older maximum until you hit your 20s. At this age you genuinely have nothing in commok with men who are 20+.  \n\nDon\u2019t go on dates where you cannot safely arrive and leave on your own, and definitely do not go on dates to someone\u2019s home/your own home. FDS has a lot of lovely tips and I truly so follow the lifestyle and have a lovely 3+ yr relationship with a HVM but again it is geared in many ways towards adults, so certain dates which have been stated as poor quality for adults can be excellent as teenagers (ej. Bowling, arcade, coffee/bubble tea). You aren\u2019t expected to be with someone long term, even if it is what you are looking for and strive for, so don\u2019t act like \u201cwifey\u201d or try imitating a lot of things that married couples are doing, just have fun and enjoy your time together as happy teens.\n\nLastly, focus on your goals and education right now. Boys are fun at this age but never let someone deter you from achieving personal goals or aspirations. No moving out of family\u2019s home for a dude if your family is lovely, no debt, no switching Universities to be closer, no skipping class, no staying up until 4 am to chat, etc. that doesn\u2019t benefit you or that you wouldn\u2019t do if you were single. Start working on your own happiness, feeling great, enjoying time with friends and doing what you want to do and leave your ex in the past. It will be hard to not check especially with ig/fb/tik tok/etc but you just have to block and make the effort until he stops being something you think of or care about. It\u2019ll be easier to move on that way.\n\nGood luck and stay strong sis the world is your oyster and the trash took itself out even if it feels terrible right now.", "created_utc": "1599974704.0", "edited": "False", "id": "g51t4kn", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_irqd3k", "parent_id": "t3_irqd3k", "score": "3", "subreddit": "FemaleDatingStrategy", "subreddit_id": "t5_xaiot"}, {"author": "Anodynic", "body": "Why is the bar so low with your standards?

I think you should stop reading too much into your relationship- people come here because they\u2019re having problems, and advice given is in relation to that specific problem.\n\nIt is a very normal couple argument to discuss who has more chores. I don\u2019t think exhaustion is manipulation even if he may be a bit less tired than he states. If you work all day you don\u2019t want to come home to a messy house. If you feel you want a break ask him to help out; I\u2019m in the same situation on summer break with my partner working as a pharmacist and while I do most of the chores, he does a bit on weekends and also always takes down the trash (even though I do leave it in front of the door too so he can\u2019t miss it). If he makes enough money too why don\u2019t you ask him for a housekeeper (depending on the country) as here we have one every month or so for three hours (30-40\u20ac) to ensure that it\u2019s properly deep cleaned. \n\nWhat I do is cook, shop (he gives me his card) for food so that it\u2019s always thought of and prepared, although I do know local take away shops (it\u2019s Spain so this is common) that do \u201chomemade\u201d meals and go there if I feel lazy, clean the kitchen (dishes is the biggest thing), pick up in general wrappers and stuff, and do the laundry. Partner does leave his socks and stuff on the floor or a chair (but we both are fairly clean people) and I\u2019ll pick it up. I fold our laundry and put it away. And besides the kitchen which I deep clean daily (it really only takes like 5 minutes if it\u2019s kept clean, which it is) I\u2019ll deep clean the bathrooms and then our bedrooms. Some people on Reddit act like this is abuse\u2014 it\u2019s normal couple stuff. The one who works more does less chores. Also, we invested in a robot vacuum which really has helped improve my life immensely, as I hate doing floors.\n\nThat said, partner also doesn\u2019t really seem to care if chores aren\u2019t done, I care more. He is the type to use every coffee mug in the house and (if he sets it in the sink which is an if haha) just grab another one and finally wash one if there aren\u2019t more or wash them all if it\u2019s the weekend. I\u2019m the one who cares more about the tidiness. So I\u2019m sorry but you\u2019re not being taken advantage of at all if you feel you are in a similar situation. Be grateful for what your husband provides to you and also recognize that certain adult things like chores, fiscal responsibility, and life being unfair are inevitable evils. If you don\u2019t like it when you get a full time job invest in a 2-5 days a week housekeeper and never do chores again in your life but it\u2019ll be expensive lol.\n\nLastly if you feel that you lack romance, try asking him out on a date and stuff. With the global pandemic it can be hard to be romantic as the world collectively is pretty depressed right now. But try writing and hiding cute notes in his stuff, doing extra chores and making him a yummy meal, dressing up, looking up places and asking if he\u2019ll take you there, etc. could bring a spark. I will tell you though adult life is less romantic and glamorous than it seems. The romance is in the mutual respect, love and time you have together not in doing flashy things for instagram or making wild proposals. Lastly I really wouldn\u2019t show him this post or mention this as if I was your partner taking care of you financially and married you and you\u2019re summer posting asking if this is minor manipulation I\u2019d be hurt and also pissed. Respect your husband\u2019s intentions more, because otherwise why marry someone who you assume is manipulative solely for their age (which again, 6-7 years is a small gap, 10,5 is mine and I\u2019m pretty much the \u201cboss\u201d in the relationship as I have a very strong personality- age doesn\u2019t equate to manipulation). And accept that you are now an adult living adult life and that consists of cleaning, cooking, washing clothes, and doing things that adults do like talk about finances and chore divisions.\n\nLastly, if you really have doubts, just stop what you\u2019re doing. Have a lazy day.

You do not have to accept a porn addict and they are not the norm.\n\n>I have no idea what to do.\n\nGet the log-in information. Take screenshots/evidence. Delete the account entirely, and/or go to the police if there are teenage minors you know.\n\n>delete my photos off his phone\n\nCheck the hidden folder on his phone. Check recently deleted. Delete any whatsapp/messaging app history between you two (legit the entire thing including the pictures/videos.) Use his computer while he's at work/not home/asleep and check his recently accessed locations to try to find porn/hidden folders, and delete ALL of them (especially as these are NOT sex workers but non consenting women). Use the CMD+R and check shell:recent for this, as well as google \"hidden files and folders command prompt tricks\" it should help you to find any folders he may have marked as hidden on his computer. Literally uninstall any privacy apps he may have (you know the type, where they allow you to have password protected folders) after trying to see if you can enter them. Many of them have an option to wipe everything after 3 attempted accesses, so just try to log in a few times and bam the files may clear themselves. Also after screenshotting messages/proof of him doing these things with the other party(parties) involved, delete their messages/photos together too from any messenger apps they may have. Bye to the majority of their disgusting collection.\n\nDon't worry about any collateral damage except for protecting yourself against him and protecting the other women. If he had important files or whatever in between his pictures of naked teenagers and creepshots, boo hoo, that's his asshole tax. Lastly, if you do confront him, record it on your phone. The regular iphone voice recorder lets you record interactions even when your phone has the screen locked. I did it with my previous landlady who was a clean obsessed freak and compulsive liar and I've done it for University class recordings (not allowed lol) and it works everytime. Small voice recorders are also cheap and can be bought at any electronics store and placed somewhere hidden if a phone seems obvious but if they're spotted they're easily recognizable.\n\nIf you have any more questions about how to go about it or other ways to check his accounts or access possible photos message me.\n\nEDIT: And lastly, in future relationships, don't send nudes. It just isn't worth it. No matter how sexy or fun or exciting it may seem at the time, even if you end up together forever, it just is always very risky business. Even if your partner is the most trustworthy person, the phone falls into the wrong hands and you lose all control over who sees the photos.

That said, I wouldn't choose Catarroja, first off you're connected by Renfe (national train company) rather than by Metrovalencia (city metro) and it's kind of ugly near the station from what I've seen no offense, this area of Spain has a LOT of beautiful places and then some kind of dusty looking town and Catarroja looks like the latter from what I've seen, mostly for people born and raised there to see it's charm. I take that train all the time down to Gandia where I live part time and Massanasa/Catarroja/Silla are just kind of ugly stops (no offense). Plus looking around on Google Maps Catarroja looks like it has terribly small streets and not that much to do, so you'd be bored a lot. Trust me, unless you drive and are out of the house often to go to the city directly, it won't be that interesting.\n\nI recommend a town connected by Metro so that you 1. don't have to drive if you don't want to and 2. have inevitably more things to do. I lived in L'eliana and while still boring it does have a shopping center, tons of nice restaurants, and a bustling community and it's way farther out than Catarroja. I don't recommend near the Burjassot-B\u00e9tera line as those are mostly University towns and areas and will be dead off season. Riba Roja, La Ca\u00f1ada, and L'eliana are honestly where I'd recommend you all to look for beautiful housing that is accessible to the city (by metro, vehicle) without being close to airports (like Manises) or in ugly areas (like Paterna, Catarroja, etc. no offense) AND that also have some expats/a close friendly community. Remember, Valencia has a second language in all towns so the townier it is, the more likely it is that people speak a lot of Valencian, so having tiny expat communities for me personally is more valuable as there are likely more areas where Castellano and even English is spoken.\n\nI especially highlight the difference between the metro and the train because they started doing hourly night metros as well (1-4 am) although it's been placed on hold for now due to COVID. But as soon as the world becomes normal again, you legitimately could stay out as long as you wanted without even having to drive in the city center whereas the trains (like the regular metro) end at \\~22:30 meaning rushed dinner to get back OR having to not drink if you go by vehicle so you can return home safely after a night of partying.

In part it is very necessary to know what to avoid and I enjoy laughing at the memes or sympathizing over horror stories but I also do enjoy hearing the success stories and celebrating everyone's success most of all. That is after all the best part to every story!\n\nBut I wouldn't sell yourself short, it absolutely isn't hopeless but it can take time. For me I had just a terrible lack of male role models and dated poorly in high school (I even was so afraid to say no to a boy that I genuinely switched schools after I told him yes...lmao). Then I realized that instead of trying to find internet boys and my typical \"type\" which clearly was not working, I felt I should focus on higher quality men. I had just left a break up with a normal regular value man who simply was a party boy uninterested in a serious relationship and I promised myself no more bad tinder dates with losers or with guys whose values didn't align, so I swiped extremely selectively afterwards.\n\nNo misogynists, no overtly sexual men, no pick up line men, no frat boys, no foreigners studying, no men who can't drive, no men who are unemployed or not in career work. Surprisingly when I was this selective there were quite a few men out there and I even chatted with one like a day or two before my current partner, although I of course told him I had already met someone and wished him luck (he was gracious throughout the process and, from following his foodie account on instagram still and participating with my partner in dinner giveaways, that guy also surely would have been a nice and normal partner too.)\n\nI think the biggest thing as well is to try to look at the overall picture. My partner and I for example have an age gap which was definitely a red flag for me at first, I even asked my mom if it was alright to date him at 20 which shows the difference, he had just gotten out of a 5 year relationship (she was unfaithful) and also he was less talkative than I was used to...but 3 years later and looking back at those things which I felt were so dramatic at the time are now so unimportant: even with the age/language/culture gap we made it work, he is chattier now but most importantly an excellent listener, something I generally am NOT as a chatterbox tbh and the ex is history.

Monday is Easter Monday (after Easter Sunday) and no I did not know it was a thing either before coming here so don't worry. Semana Santa is just a bunch of events generally so try to prepare for the food beforehand. Same with Fallas and Christmas time: have some food stocked up just in case!\n\nAlso, lastly, try Cons\u00fam (Mercadona equivalent with better brands but worse veggies/fruits/meat), Supercor (gas station equivalent with better hours but higher prices) and/or Carrefour (luxury/imported goods as well as regular items, tends to be slightly more expensive depending on what you get) as well (I haven't gone to the other shops) when you're hungry.\n\nI tend to always have some of that cheap Mercadona already cooked shredded chicken (you can find it near the processed meats in the fridge) and the XXL noodles  ajo or pollo con finas hierbas flavors which I mix together with some soy sauce and butter for a quick, cheap meal. Keep frozen San Jacobos, fruits/vegetables frozen (I have garlic, chopped onion, broccoli, carrot, peas and coliflour) and frozen croquetas/chicken fingers. Consum has excellent frozen chicken fingers and also these yummy frozen bread melts (the jam\u00f3n york and queso is the best). Obviously I prefer fresh food but those are what I personally keep at home to ensure I don't go hungry. Also mejillones, clams, etc. in cans, ventresca (expensive tuna, I eat it alone with tomato/salt/olive oil) and tuna cans, as well as canned soups are also good to keep.\n\nDO KEEP WHAT YOU LIKE IN PROCESSED/CANNED/NON PERISHABLE FOOD especially for the first year or two when you're not used to holidays. I spent too many Sundays here not having food to eat. That said, I recommend you try a lot of Spanish recipes which have relatively few ingredients, taste delicious, and make a large quantity (ej. Gazpacho manchego, gazpacho andaluz, arroz al senyoret, paella valenciana, etc.) so that you learn some nice cultural dishes and always have yummy food available.\n\nI'm personally making Gazpacho manchego tonight (had burgers for lunch, and Sunday tomorrow I'm going to make a philly cheesesteak and arroz a la cubana, then Monday pasta with alfredo and tapas with whatever else is left in the house.) Meal planning is somewhat needed here when it comes to holidays/sundays.

Look at the picture of the H2O VSEPR model.\n\nSo essentially you know that H2O is tetrahedral but you're unsure why the bonded pairs are neighbors? That is due to the difference in repulsion between bonded pairs and lone pairs. In a  \u03c3 (single/sigma) bond, Between H-O, there are the two electrons chillin' in a cloud and then the positive nuclei. Think of it like a magnet, with both of them repelling the electrons one way and far out from the nucleus of each of them. Obviously Oxygen is a bit more electronegative (attractive to electrons) so it the electrons are a teeny bit closer to oxygen, but they're still being compressed by the two positive forces in the H and O nuclei sort of working against each other to push away the electrons. This allows the bonded electrons to be pretty far out and not very repulsive (but also occupying less volume due to the control of the protons). \n\nNow in a lone pair you just have the proton force (from oxygen's nucleus) and then two electrons. They don't have a secondary repulsive proton to push them in a compartmentalized area, so they are closer to the nucleus and occupy more space than bonded pairs due to that. Thus the unbonded lone pairs will be closer to the central atom and more repulsive (aka occupying more space visually) whereas the bonded ones will be farther out and less repulsive.\n\nA trick I do is drawing my lone pairs and [drawing a little circular loop \"cloud\" around them](https://www.chemicool.com/images/water-lone-pair.png)to show the space they take up, it's totally arbitrary but visually shows you after making your lewis models and trying to go to vsepr sort of how the influence will go. So that is why instead of being opposites they're close neighbors, because the bonded pairs are forced into tiny little areas and the lone pairs are more free to push people around because they only have one proton force controlling them vs the two proton forces for each bonded pair.\n\nHopefully that makes sense in simpler terms :)", "created_utc": "1583879827.0", "edited": "1583880319.0", "id": "fk5g5rk", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_fgk5yy", "parent_id": "t3_fgk5yy", "score": "2", "subreddit": "chemhelp", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s6e6"}, {"author": "Anodynic", "body": "You turned me into Karen!

His feelings are just hurt I'm assuming. \n\nAlso my partner eats a lot of spicy food and also bitter food. I like it a few notches less spicy, hate bitter food and I also eat a lot more salt than him. So we alternate meal planning/cooking although I cook more generally and I always hold the cayenne pepper and chilli flakes until I've separated my half, what allows it to feel united just slightly different. \n\nThat said, I always try new foods he brings home and/or at restaurants. I really don't like olives but since I don't hate them I always try at least one when they serve them before the meal so it feels more united, it's a joke now for me to say \"yep, still gross.\" And I generally let him order as he enjoys showing me food from the area and talking about the history (and it's led me to discovering amazing new meals). So aside from the bigger issue (that isn't food), that's how my partner and I deal with the surface issue of actual food.\n\nAs an aside, I also remember in psychology class that there are three types of tasters, something like 25% supertasters (very sensitive, tend to be picky eaters, can taste easily small changes in meals, tend to not like super spicy/bitter, have more taste buds), 25% nontasters (tend to be the healthier eaters that enjoy vegetables and aren't bothered by bitter foods, can eat large amounts of bitter foods without \"masking\" the flavor, have less taste buds) and then the rest somewhere in between. I am \"a supertaster\" (the test in class consisted of tasting a piece of paper that was EXTREMELY bitter to me and another classmate, the rest found it unpleasant but eh and a few couldn't taste anything, although I fit the stereotype regardless). Might be a good talking point to mention that not all tongues and tasters are on the same level to take away from the personal attack he's feeling.

It is expensive, honestly it is kind of crappy in most places the housing (no offense) and it doesn't seem like the nicest area to me. Also very, very loud and impossible to park. I think the beach sounds nicer in our head than it is in real life. It also gets ridiculously windy in winter seasons and you'd have sand everywhere. It's not just \"cold\" but so, so so windy which is why nobody goes there except in warmer times. I recommend you somewhere between Alameda to Ayora metro stations since you'd have the greenery + closeness to the center by metro + closeness to the beach by metro but you will also have a loooot of Uni students near.\n\nIf you give up the beach idea accepting that it is easy to go by vehicle/bike/train/bus/valenbisi/electric scooter from almost anywhere in the city then live near T\u00faria station (easy access + walking distance to the city) or if you want a more hip/modern area try Russafa/La Gran V\u00eda although they are probably pretty expensive. I'm familiar with la gran v\u00eda and it's definitely one of my favorite areas as it's not too noisy but with a lot of nightlife nearby, has a lot of interesting restaurants, easy walk/bike/access to greenery and the city.\n\nLoudness is entirely irrelevant based on the area (except the ayuntamiento/X\u00e1tiva/C\u00f3lon/\u00c1ngel Guimera, stay awaaaay) but moreso it depends on the apartment.

OP did the right thing in informing the parents as there's absolutely zero excuse to put your health and life at risk (and yes, vomiting multiple times a day uncontrollably and getting worse is definitely cause for concern to see a doctor just in case). A lot of situations can make going to the doctor uncomfortable emotionally but that is never an excuse to hide illness and avoid medical treatment over symptoms that are worsening with an unknown cause. Sister is NTA for the fear but needs to be treated, even if that is just diagnosed and put on bedrest with lots of liquids.

Nobody likes to think of these things but even common illnesses can turn deadly. \n\nAlso, the doctors are there to find out the medical cause. I even assumed that OP's sibling was pregnant until they said they were trans; biological sex is relevant in exclusion of certain illnesses as well as knowing what medications they are taking (i.e. hormones) as all medication DOES have adverse effects (source: pharm student) and is something that is going to be continue to be necessary to address. At this point **OP and family should definitely already have a primary care provider(s) AND pharmacist(s) who knows the situation and makes sister feel comfortable.** ESPECIALLY if they are going through HRT and/or frequently having medical visits. And if not then I recommend OP address that. Most doctors are genuinely nice people who went into the profession to help, and after gathering required anamnesis they shouldn't need to bring up any sex-based topic unless discussing specifically HRT and/or things (such as if OP's sibling didn't get the HPV shot yet due to changing regulations, things of that nature).\n\nOP did the right thing out of love and while I understand sibling's discomfort, the only thing medical staff wants to do is help the sick child stop vomiting and alleviate symptoms.

You need to turn off the television and communicate rather than being pissed about it. You may have to have unfair \"doing this WITH her\" moments until it gets fully clean, but let her know that you need her to step up. As I previously suggested, chore lists will help her keep fully accountable and make any excuses of \"But I did a lot it doesn't show..!\" null and void. It is also a lot easier to maintain an already clean house rather than clean a messy one. Yours sounds.... really messy (sorry). But honestly, if you're otherwise happy then these types of issues are transient, fixable ones and all couples go through some type of thing like this. You are dating a 22 year old, her brain is still literally changing, she isn't just some rock who is incapable of learning and improving and will probably be very different with the next few years to come. I know the me who started dating my partner is totally different from the me last year, and she's way different from the me now. It's an age thing. But that still isn't an excuse (however with her back you've chosen an inopportune moment, and this is a large shift at once, so like I said, be patient, take it slowly, but be firm. And help out.)\n\nIt may suck at first having to sit there and do things with her but it should be sort of the kick she needs to realize, look, this is part of adulting. And like I said, A LOT of what it sounds like is some type of emotional issue, which isn't surprising considering her physical AND mental issues that you've mentioned since BEFORE you got together. A lot of it should improve after surgery, and if you really are dedicated then things like this ARE work-through-able.\n\n*   There is literally a pile of her stuff in every room in the house until I clean it up because it'll sit for days or weeks before she touches in  \n\nAs I said, you need to simply tell her a few days beforehand \"I want to get this cleaned up with you x date\" or tell her in the moment where you both have spare time \"we're going to clean x now\" and go through with it. You ignoring it and then being upset about it isn't helping anything but allowing you to act victimized. She's procrastinating and depressed, not maliciously forcing you to clean. Another suggestion that may help: hire a maid service (I'd also encourage this to be a \"her\" cost if , after budgeting, it's affordable and she doesn't have a ton of credit card debt from her frivolous purchases.)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>  I will come home and there will be a trail of lights and TVs on from where she was before she left. I have asked her multiple times to be more conscious and it's always \"I'm sorry, I'll do better\" but nothing ever changes. \n\nThis again is something that is fixable but she needs to want to fix it. You need to talk about it when you're not upset, but when you're otherwise happy and spending normal time together in a frank manner: Look, this is happening. I keep communicating that you need to do better, and you're not. I understand the physical challenges you're going through but turning off a light and leaving the television running when you aren't watching it are inexcusable. This is costing me money for literally no reason and you are not contributing even in ways that you can be, and it is making me upset and feeling unheard. Actions speak louder than words and \"I'm sorry\" just isn't cutting it for me. This needs to change. You need a come to Jesus talk rather than just the same old griping.\n\n> Every now and then she will ask if I need help, which I'm always happy to take, but it's usually just for a minute or two until she can't handle any more and ends up back on the couch.\n\nThis is both a good thing and a bad thing. The good thing is that she's offering to help, the bad thing is that it's physically hurting her after mere minutes, which is again probably scary and something she really doesn't have control over. That said, encourage her to organize recipes. Look them up on the phone/laptop. Evernote the shit out of your favorite recipes. Encourage her to sign up for the grocery delivery, which can be done purely by laptop, that way the groceries come to y'all rather than her going for the groceries (something which probably is physically painful given it seems she can barely do much without hurting.)\n\n*  I do not feel like I have a partner, I feel like I just adopted a 22 year old.  \n\nI mean yeah, you kind of did, but now you're in the situation. My relationship, with similar ages..is quite different. But she also has a physical incapacity to take care of herself, you also moved in together quite fast, and you've seemingly been happy with everything she has talked about: being a wife, having children young, etc. so it's kind of rude to go around now acting like you're being taken advantage of when you are the one who let her get to this point in the first place and actively encouraged it with your actions.\n\n*   she gets triggered when I try to have a conversation about it. \n\nThat's a too bad, so sad thing and THAT is something that is a big deal and could be potentially a dealbreaker. Emotional problems will get better after the surgery likely, which will improve the physical problems, which will improve health/energy, which will lead to a likely improvement in housework. But if you lack basic capacity to communicate about these things then that's literally the foundation of a relationship. You cannot be a partner with someone who refuses to communicate about adult matters or about the necessary things. This is really serious, and it sounds like she doesn't realize how serious it is. She can cry, but you need to lay all of it out and also it sounds like give time periods for when you are going to have to make decisions on if you even are willing to continue this relationship if you do not see improvement. She needs to know how serious it is for you, as she may not realize it (especially with everything else going on.)", "created_utc": "1580340411.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ffy84bl", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_evqu2k", "parent_id": "t1_ffy6g9f", "score": "2", "subreddit": "relationships", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qjvn"}, {"author": "Anodynic", "body": "Hi, OP, 22F with a 33M here feeling I may be able to give some insight:\n\nNo, you are not being taken advantage of. You are the adultier adult in this situation and have the power, she is still 22 and growing more and more dependent on you. There is zero way she has power in this situation so don't try to spin it into something it is not.\n\nYou both have loving families, love each other, are from the same workplace (kind of weird not gonna lie) and have similar interests, so those are all good fundamental things. Cleanliness is something that does change over time, like three years ago my ex complained about how I never cleaned, now my current partner claims I clean too much. So I wouldn't be surprised if this was moreso depression related, tiredness and age but it isn't something that is fundamental and static; a lot of slobs grow into cleaner people with help.\n\nThe University thing I don't understand; she's working and at the same place you're at...she can't be doing too poorly if you are in the same workplace. I'd say drop it for a while, some people just genuinely don't aspire for University (regardless of work ethic) and it seems that she is one of them and has always been open about it. This is something that probably will not change.\n\nNow advice on your issues: I think a HUGE issue you have here is that you are treating her like a 50/50 equal without acting like it; you criticise more than you construct and that isn't a good thing. \n\n*  My main issue is that she does next to nothing to help me maintain the home or pay bills or anything. Since I had been paying all bills prior to her moving in with no issue, we made an agreement that she would be conscious of the energy and water she is using in the home, would take care of all groceries, and would help me keep the house neat and clean.  \n\nSolution: One, you remind her plainly of this agreement and that she isn't stepping up and it's making you seriously reconsider the relationship. Be firm and empathetic without straying from the very serious energy this needs. Then, rather than say this to the very stressed, pain-ridden 22 year old: GIVE HER SOLUTIONS. You are the adultier adult and need to accept that you are going to have to guide her through a lot of things. My partner and I are pretty equal but there are some things that 10,5 years of experience just give you, and certain things (such as managing finances) comes easier to him who owns two businesses rather than me who is still working on using my first bank account. So solution A; she clean. But rather than talking about it, give her a list of things you expect done, a literal chore list. This helps keep it objective, no arguments, as well as will help her with accountability. Either that or she start paying bills, period: and you need to budget. If she wants to play wifey-to-be then she needs to let you help budget. It is likely she is mismanaging her money from the amount of clothing she is buying and is actively procrastinating on fixing it.\n\nAnother thing: Research is showing procrastination is not a sign of laziness but rather a sign of emotional stress. She is procrastinating because she knows it is going to be bad and prefers to accept the punishment now rather than suffer through it anyways. This can be improved. A lot of what you describe sounds to me like depression and just not being aware of how to live in this new dynamic. You're an adult who has been through all of this before, and stop comparing both of your situations because you at 22 is not her at 22, you're different people, not just your ages.\n\nIf she can't bend then she can plan grocery lists and manage what is in the kitchen cupboards. You lift the laundry basket of clean clothing onto the couch so, while sitting, she can fold them. She has enough energy to do other tasks like open clothing boxes and check the mail, so she can do those things. First and foremost however are taking care of the pets.\n\n*   is why I constantly offer to help her but it just falls on deaf ears. \n\nSolution: It is a weekend, neither of you are working. Rather than do what you normally do, tell her you are going to tackle the room. Communicate this with her through the week so she knows what to expect, don't be surprised if she whines a bit. You are, after all, in an uncomfortably parental role at the moment as she's genuinely shifted from being dependent essentially on her parents probably into being dependent essentially to you, so she may have difficulties separating household duties as an adult as being lectured by her parent(s).\n\n(cont).", "created_utc": "1580339469.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ffy6g9f", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_evqu2k", "parent_id": "t3_evqu2k", "score": "3", "subreddit": "relationships", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qjvn"}, {"author": "Anodynic", "body": "WE HAVE THE SAME EYES OP YOU GORGEOUS THING:\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/RLj0XVL](https://imgur.com/a/RLj0XVL) I made a post asking docs what's up, it's my most recent in my post history, and the upvoted dude /u/jcarberry basically said it's the UPPER lid crease that's the exaggerated one (tbh that's my favorite side of my face, I thought the droopiness was the \"weirder\" part) and to make sure that no eyeball is further out from another looking from above or below just in case (for thyroid issues) but for me it wasn't and they just said yeah cosmetic surgery/botox would be able to fix it.\n\nIn my opinion I'd look into a licensed practitioner BUT I do want to say OP you are gorgeous and not just because we have the same eyes but objectively and literally I've called out my \"young thom yorke eye\" like 50000 times and not a single person has noticed until I've specifically pointed it out, so if you do it remember it'll 100% be a you thing and 99% of people probably won't notice unless you directly have pointed it out or informed them about the botox so look into how much money it is and be honest if you want it for you or for others (because for me literally nobody notices my asymmetry although I think it's quite ezpz to see especially for those of us with the same eye thing)  \n\n\nEDIT: And that said before doing anything be sure to tell them which eye is your favorite one!!!

I noticed it didn't seem to matter to a lot of people but for me it really bothered me having so many alternatives based on countries ESPECIALLY since spoken language (imo) the day to day speak really varies with a lot of things so I do recommend you teaching your kiddos by picking a country and sticking to their Spanish prior to expanding out (which is difficult and I'd recommend near high school level once they're already fluent)\n\nReally though all of the Disney movies and kids movies out there are marketed heavily in other countries and have easy dubs; animated films are the BEST for learning imo because they're extremely professional and it's sort of what everyone just does. Bob esponja is a hit here too. Tadeo Jones is a Spanish based movie I believe that they enjoyed.

Mobility is a lot easier and heavily encouraged in Europe in comparison to the US. Essentially being an international student just gives you the benefits that every other EU native/student gets with mobility and easier entry and transfers. But yeah my own University even has an in-english degree it's just stupid expensive as I'm in a private uni not public. And the public unis have them too in English.\n\nIn fact, almost every medical program in the EU requires a certain level of English proficiency as well so you'd be surprised how many medical programs there are. I would be surprised if there weren't English-speaking medical programs in German, they're just probably easier to find as a German resident, lol. I know here in Valencia, ES there are three universities offering Medicine as a degree with a large part of the classes in English.\n\nThat said though, there are a lot of options so you have to look into them and explore them because they all do of course come with risks and either monetary (while lesser than the US) or heavy time (greater than the US imo) expenses...\n\nIMO, studying in a foreign country isn't even that hard due to primarily the language barrier (as technical words tend to be fairly similar...Abetalipoprotein\u00e4mie in German is abetalipoproteinemia in Eng/Es, a word you'll see in a medical course easily). It's hard because even while understanding 98% of what the teacher says, that 2% really does make or break the ability to learn in that language, so you essentially go to class to understand what is most important, then go home and re-read to be able to fully process (because class goes so fast in Uni that you really can't be translating and learning at the same time) and then go to English based resources to essentially ensure you have it down properly...And the wordplay in exams can be tricky. In English you'd easily notice if there was a difference between hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia in a large sentence asking about Diabetes and be able to catch that, whereas in German you're going to be expending a large amount of extra mental energy you just don't expend in your native language just to READ the question, so seeing tiny nuances is a lot harder.\n\nYou have to really bust your ass because while in your native country classes you can probably pass classes without studying very much just by going every day and paying attention, in Uni in a foreign country/language you have to go to every class AND bust your ass studying every day because you don't retain info and especially slight differences as easily. And personally, I used to be a really high scoring student in high school (and was even in charter schools, ap classes, etc.) I came to Uni here and am struggling just to pass with a 5/10 most of my exams even though I've missed 0 classes this entire semester and study daily. So really think if commiting to medical school in a foreign country is 100% what you want...honestly most days I think I'd rather be in debt because at least I'd have the confidence of high grades and knowing I'd be able to get a job after Uni to pay it off..interviews are hard.

I wouldn't know how to classify my Spanish as I've learned two years (plus online college classes) Spanish, plus 3 ish years of full immersion (with two spanish boyfriends during this time) but in the exams I've taken they seem to heavily focus on grammar and are more difficult than just communicating your ideas.  \n\nDo I think it's realistic to be able to go to Medical School in Germany after learning only for 1,5 years? Sure. But I don't think the certification is, especially with your other commitments. \n\nSo in my opinion since you don't already know German and are just wanting cheap/good medical school...try Spain/Portugal or a different country with less stringent requirements. Once in the EU as a full time international student, you can then join Erasmus I believe (but can't join Erasmus from the US) and go to Germany or wherever. Also all ECTS schools let you hop around Europe after you graduate (your degree is valid in all countries that follow this system) so you could still work in Germany even after having studied in a different University. My partner was in Berlin in a glasses store after finishing his second degree for 4 years after doing an Erasmus stint and his German is good but not great. His pharmacy and his opthamology (can't spell lol) degree are valid in both Spain and Germany because they follow ECTS. \n\nThey're (public) cheap too. I'm in private for Pharmacy and it's only around 8k euros a year (which is a lot, but not a lot compared to US Pharmacy.)

I told my partner \"look, if I move to your country I lose my scholarships and a lot of stability and life plans and also have to leave my family and I'd need your financial support\" and he said he understood, accepted it for months before I even moved, and we've been in that situation ever since very contently and he takes extra good care of me, because we have good communication. Randomly deciding to change the relationship dynamic and asking for an arbitrary amount of monthly money in a LDR that is just for random spending money is just...not the right way to go about it.\n\nThese situations really need to have their appropriate reasons and be discussed though, and also being 26 he probably doesn't have all that extra money anyways. Asking for 100 just because of whatever is so arbitrary and uncomfortable in my opinion...he isn't wrong, just keep living like before is not torture. And if you want a job and are willing to sacrifice literally the only free time you two have to see each other then I mean that's your prerogative but I'm not surprised he's not a fan of the idea considering you're giving up essentially all of your free time for a job you don't necessarily need. That said of course it's not comfortable not having extra money for the goods when you have the time, skills, and desire to work, and I'd be skeeved out by my partner telling me not to work (although am choosing to believe in the way he said it is more of him not wanting to lose 90% of your free time to see each other, maybe more, rather than him being controlling). So you just need to take a personal moment to decide what is more important to you and have open, honest, lengthy discussionS about this with him until you all find a compromise or you decide to split.", "created_utc": "1578079455.0", "edited": "False", "id": "fcyfqh9", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_ejjqot", "parent_id": "t3_ejjqot", "score": "2", "subreddit": "AmItheAsshole", "subreddit_id": "t5_2xhvq"}, {"author": "Anodynic", "body": "ESH.\n\n> Should I have stuck it out for my friend's sake \n\nNo, you should have given notice.

Book at least a month in advance for highly desired restaurants (top 40 on tripadvisor/thefork) and at least two weeks in advance for others.

Valencia is extremely safe and lovely, don't hesitate to book cheaper places in the city because they're probably very decent. You may want to look for package deals however if you're looking to meet people (like room + blah blah event or whatever) as those tend to be more social from what I've seen (although I've never personally done one.)\n\n>Any \u201cto do\u201d and \u201cdo not do\u201d are also welcome!  \n\nDon't touch the fallas. Don't touch the falleros. Don't take a taxi or uber, Fallas is the only time of year where it's literally undriveable due to the blockage of streets from the huge fallas and the stupid amount of people there are. Plan metro trips otherwise it'll be super jam packed, so if you're let's say heftier or don't like people pushed against you on the train, go on off-hours. As goofy as it may sound I'd genuinely rent a bike (google valenbisi or a different bike rental company) or an electric scooter as the best way to get around during this time, with the metro being the second best, on foot the third, buses after that, and if you absolutely MUST then I guess by vehicle. Look up the schedule ahead of time, many things are in Valencian and can be confusing personally. Don't feel obligated to go to everything on there as many are \"infant\u00edl\" (children) fallas which wouldn't be cool for an adult or are just kind of boring (no offense). The burning will be the best part. \n\nAlso don't wait to buy alcohol at night. You're not legally allowed past 10:00 pm (although go to an \"Indian\" neighborhood store that is open and they will probably sell it to you.) If you need something goofy like a plug adapter go to a local \"Chinese\" store (they generally won't be on google maps but are everywhere), they're Valencia's version of the dollar store. And yes unfortunately they don't have any other names for these stores except \"el indio\" and \"el chino\", it made me feel weird at first too, but it's how it is. \n\nOtherwise have fun and enjoy.", "created_utc": "1577991470.0", "edited": "False", "id": "fcuz919", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_ej107u", "parent_id": "t3_ej107u", "score": "7", "subreddit": "valencia", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qn44"}, {"author": "Anodynic", "body": "> We are not interested in international schools for not only the insane price, but also for the fact that we want her to get immersed with the culture and language as quickly as possible. \n\nWell I can't personally say much about elementary schools however my little sister went to American School of Valencia (ASV) at your girl's age and was extremely immersed (and still had to learn a separate language besides English and Spanish, lol). The immersion is the same, so if price isn't that big of an issue I'd give it a double take (they also are very generous with payment plans and such). Russafa is a very hip area with mostly food places and housing, it will be quite busy up until around midnight at least due to the restaurant and nightclub activity in certain roads. That said, you can barely hear street noise from apartments in Valencia so it really doesn't matter too much. Everywhere is pretty good and safe to live and pretty family friendly even near nightclubs and such.\n\nThe best thing to do is, in my opinion, call once schools are back in for specific information (won't be until after Three Kings, mid January is your best bet to start) one of the local schools and ask around. If you can't speak Spanish well enough to communicate, then I really do recommend at least calling ASV for some information, they're really nice and will help a ton. I even took my SAT at 20 y/o there (alongside a bunch of other Spanish high schoolers...awkward lol) and they're extremely involved in the international community so I think getting to know them a bit will be helpful. My partner's niece also goes to a private school in a town (British one) and they too are extremely polite. Call Caxton or ASV or whichever for \"information on schooling\" as well as \"information on the difference between public and private here\" and they'll let you know what's up. Also don't be afraid to mention interest \"but finances could be an issue\" and they'll be super helpful. \n\nFrom what I've seen most schools are basically like in the states but more Catholic. \n\nLastly, since I'm unfortunately not able to help any more with the schooling...\n\nRussafa is great. Book \"Kaori Rusafa/Kawori\" (I think they changed their name recently to the latter) for your wife and kiddo for a special lunch/dinner date if they like sushi, it'll change your life. Chocova is the best bakery in town for any special events, the rest of the bakeries tend to be very...pastry-like rather than sweet, American Cupcakes isn't very good (sorry). Mercadona (best meat), Consum (brand names at mercadona prices, only downside is it's halfway in Valencian), and Dia%/Lidl(cheap) are the main grocery stores,  although el Corte Ingles has the largest variety by far, most ingredients you'll be looking for (although slightly higher prices of course) and is the biggest. Supercor is expensive and small but they're open until 2 am so they're kind of a big deal, stay away unless you really need groceries after 9:30 pm. Literally every restaurant in Russafa is pretty dang good so enjoy walks around the neighborhood to inspire you all to choose what to eat. There's a huge American/English community in Valencia, google \"Meetup\" and join that website and you'll be connected instantly, or look on local Facebook groups. \n\nAlmost every ingredient exists here but has a funky name so don't instantly run to Taste of America if you're looking for a special ingredient in a recipe, although some may be expensive (like marshmallows...seriously almost 3\u20ac a packet.) Frozen food is alright but not as delicious as in the states, if you don't want to cook and aren't sure how everyone manages to have delicious meals all the time, find a ration food place. La Cuina is one I always mention just because they're on justeat and have a website but there are tons in the neighborhood and also in certain Mercadonas (it is called Comida Para Llevar). Basically it's already cooked local food at insanely low prices because they batch cook it and everyone and their grandmothers eat this way the majority of days. Find your local bread place and your local \"comida para llevar\" place and you can literally feed your family off of like \u20ac25 a week eating new things every day just with bread and food rations. \n\nFood time is 13:30 to 17:00 for lunch and 20:00 to 00:00 for dinner generally, some restaurant bars will be open \"all day\" but the kitchen will not. Those bars are for breakfast, brunch (almuerzo) and merienda and will have things like toast with jam, juice, and sandwiches for those meals but not much else except drinks outside of the aforementioned hours.\n\nAny other info you all would like let me know through DM or you or your wife can message me on instagram (@caitygart). I've only been in the area for around 4 ish years (8 months of those I lived in London) and I currently am living part time in a small town an hour away and part time in a small town with a metro stop but I used to live part time in the Gran V\u00eda for a few months as well and know a bit about the area.

Your best bet is to search \"Mediterranean Restaurant\" wherever you are in Valencia at the time on google maps, choose 3,5 or 4 stars and up (the other ones unrated, unlisted, or slightly lower probably are fine but may not be popular enough to have english speakers) and you'll find a great one. Like you said, the biggest issue in Valencia is variety, almost anywhere you go is probably delicious.\n\nI've personally been to this one that I know is really centered around fish;\n\n[https://www.lamaryrestaurant.com/la-mary-valencia/](https://www.lamaryrestaurant.com/la-mary-valencia/) 21,95\u20ac pp MEN\u00da dinner, really nice just of course slightly pricey, and the carta has a toooon of fish and i think is probably cheaper (they have large portion sizes, a fish and a drink is really all that's needed to be full). That said, it is in the center and a bit pricey, so really your best bet is just google maps wherever you are for a mediterranean restaurant and take your chances on whichever looks nice from outside and seems delicious after reading the carta.\n\nOff the top of my head I can't think of many more because with local food you honestly tend to just look at the carta/men\u00fa which is on the outside of each restaurant (don't be afraid to walk up and look even if you're not going in at all) and then just choose the ones you want. I don't think I can ever say I've had a particularly bad tapas experience except maybe \"Bar Canada\" (they were nice the food was just pretty meh.)\n\nAlso, with orxata, I personally think it tastes terrible (don't kill me any Valencians who are reading this) like a crappy watery almond milk HOWEVER you can find it in any horchater\u00eda/helader\u00eda/cafeter\u00eda/bar pretty much and there are also tons of food cart looking things like outside of the North Station and randomly on the street near Col\u00f3n which tend to have Orxata too, or waffles and churros. I tried mine personally en horchateria santa catalina (and later I've had sips from all over from people who can't believe I hate orxata, it tastes pretty much the same everywhere), cute looking place and great staff and the other foodstuff was great but man I really hate orxata.\n\nIf you order orxata and end up hating it, ask for a coffee, tea, or chocolate con leche (for hot chocolate, if you order just hot chocolate they will give you an extremely dense version of melted chocolate that is for dipping churros and not for drinking). It's really easy to find though, so don't sweat it or try googling and planning. Honestly the biggest planning should be around what to do, good food is really everywhere but I do recommend you quickly popping all of my recommendations into a google maps list just in case you're super hungry and not sure where to go in the end.\n\nP.S., if you like cocktails, \"Hawaika\" is a great place near walking distance from where you're staying.", "created_utc": "1577490663.0", "edited": "1577490897.0", "id": "fc6vmz3", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_ege04l", "parent_id": "t1_fc6u0mr", "score": "1", "subreddit": "valencia", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qn44"}, {"author": "Anodynic", "body": "Please don't hesitate to reach out!

There's so much food that is delicious (and like Goiko, Breeza, Nacionsushi, The Black Turtle) are instagrammable/photogenic, less than 20\u20acpp, and truly scrumptious. There is legitimately no need to pay higher except with expensive meat foods and/or a higher class dining experience (for special occasions/rich people lmao) You should never have to spend more than 20\u20acpp for an excellent meal each time, and you can easily eat very well on much less.

Your wife probably would have never been friends with her anyways if you guys didn't come off as a package deal (\"we've been \"platonic friends\" for deeecades\") and you basically forced this person into the marriage too. This person who you're now letting rub her ass all over you and touch you when your wife is out of the room and playfully flirt when she's got her back turned. So gross OP. Take some responsibility for where you are and stop saying \"but it's all her fault and I'm innocent and don't know what to do\" because you know what to do and that's to stop, kick this girl out of your lives and talk to your goddamned wife like a grown man.", "created_utc": "1576495277.0", "edited": "1576495567.0", "id": "fb3xzqj", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_eb7y6i", "parent_id": "t1_fb3mj9j", "score": "374", "subreddit": "relationships", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qjvn"}, {"author": "Anodynic", "body": "Be careful with this one.

Going vegetarian wont change your possibilities of obtaining parasites or pathogenic microorganisms as they are found on all sorts of fruits and vegetables unwashed that have come into contamination with generally feces, are found on the floor, are found in untreated water or lake water (looking at you Naegleria) and also can be passed from person to person (butt scratching before a handshake for example is enough to do it with certain Taenia, and they like to fester outside of the butthole at night) or through things like sex.\n\nAppropriate protocol to prevent these things:\nCook your meat. Freeze any meat you don\u2019t cook although that won\u2019t help in all cases. Fridge won\u2019t kill many microorganisms (see Listeria monocytogenes for example). Wash your hands. Wash all of your veggies and fruits and eggs etc before eating. Don\u2019t poop near livestock or raise livestock near feces. Be hygenic overall. Treat and diagnose the sick.

I'm in Pharmacy although I've worked with the communications department closely as I am part of certain marketing projects for my University and have many friends in all types of classes (to be journalists, newscasters, videographers, etc.). This does not happen. You need a B2 in Spanish to be able to graduate from whatever degree, JOURNALISM and COMMUNICATIONS included. Do they mark incorrect grammar and spelling a little harshly in those courses in comparison to my Pharm courses? Of course!\n\nDo they mark the Venezuelans, Chileans, Portuguese, students from Brasil, Panamanians, Mexicans, whomever, for using carro instead of coche? No, or if they do it's a very light -0,1 or -0,05 off. Listen, I've lived and worked in London in finance/billing at a company where communication was extremely important, too. In the U.K. when I sent e-mails every day to all sorts of companies, had meetings, and strict dress code I spoke exclusively in U.S. English and guess what? Nobody corrected me and I did my job just fine.\n\nShe clearly passed the entrance exams and was getting around 55% on her papers JUST excluding the few Australian differences, and you think it's adequate to mark her down ALMOST HALF OF HER GRADE? Jesus! You are the type of teacher that frothes at the mouth at using Calibri instead of Arial, and who seems to take pride on failing people, and that's not cool. The other students as well as her are all standing up to defend her. People don't defend others from their country unless they ALL feel an injustice happened. Most of the foreigners at my school are French (over half of the entire international population) or Moroccan (over a quarter of the entire international population.) Nobody defends their French or Moroccan homies here if they failed because they know they deserved to fail for not doing work, but they absolutely will step up if an injustice happens.\n\nPeople aren't stepping up because she's lazy and deserve to fail, they're stepping up to complain to the department (something students really would prefer not to do) because you believe it's adequate to remove 45% of her assignment grades for words such as elevator rather than LIFT and color rather than COLOUR. I'm also assuming that her original assignments would probably be a lot higher than 55% with a less harsh and more understanding instructor, because if you remove a solid 40%+ for like the very few language differences from Australian English that she is missing, lord knows how much else you remove for other petty and pedantic mistakes.\n\nOP, YTA. You are directly working against internationalism and globalism being so stringent and I would be surprised if anyone enjoyed your class. The only thing they are learning is to participate the minimum possible in your class so they can get by unscathed and to conform entirely to your viewpoint. Education is supposed to be about learning and growth. Of course your department is going to defend you rather than the student because they gave you the green light to grade as you do everyone else. The difference is Australians don't have the extra difficulties and can probably scrape by doing their best effort with your class and paying attention to what you personally like, whereas the other US Students have clearly all noticed the unfairness and while they were able to pass putting forth the same extra plus more in having to figure out what words are too American, are vehemently defending this girl because she isn't wrong in that the marks are exaggerated.\n\nShould she have done everything in Australian English? Yes. But if she was having a 55%-60% excluding the few differences, she should have NEVER gone below a 50% for the few linguistic differences.\n\nI don't know what kind of planet you are on where you think you're a good professor if over half of your grade relies strictly on adding a U in Color and neighbor and other minor things.\n\n**And yes, I had to learn the metric system too and have studied fully in Spanish since day 1, but nobody has ever marked me off for having a period instead of a comma for 3.5mL (3,5mL in Spain) or for things like claiming HCl is \u00e1cido hidrocluroro rather than \u00e1cido hidrocl\u00f3rico because they're not pretentious assholes and it doesn't change the quality of the work. I guarantee you this lady isn't going to get fired because she wrote elevator instead of lift, and if that's the difference between her passing ok and failing miserably then YTA**  \n\n\nEDIT: Alright I changed it to ESH because y'all are giving me perspectives I hadn't thought of before.

Make friends. You already have a busy life with your computer science work, so you can't add Spanish as part of your workload because it's already full. Thus, you add it into your \"free time.\"\n\nChange minor things such as video game language, interface language, subtitles, etc. into Spanish at first. Put your favorite series on that you enjoy rewatching in Spanish language with English subtitles and then eventually Spanish with Spanish. Change computer programs you're familiar with into the Spanish language. Choose your region, by the way. Mexican Spanish is very different to Castellano which is very different to Chilean, so prioritize quickly as learning the casual way means you will hear more slang than you ever would in classes.\n\nFor me I took two years of high school classes in Spanish and two more in German. I don't know any German. I thought I'd know Spanish well since I aced most classes. I did not. I came here at 18 on a whim with family and holy cow were those first few months hard, I knew practically nothing. Pirated Rosetta Stone and did my best to google translate everything and brought a mini dictionary with me but progress was slow, grueling, and I didn't even feel confident calling on the phone or going to the store.\n\nLater I met friends (through their interest in English ha) and went shopping and did things which helped me learn bit by bit the \"school-type\" things, but again it's so much different in daily life having to ask \"oye sabe donde est\u00e1 la harina???\" than sitting in a class hearing \"ENRIQUE COMPR\u00d3 UNA MANZANA. UNA MANZANA ROJA.\" So annoying.\n\nLater I made friends and met a boyfriend, while we spoke English his friends did not and so all of the conversations were in Spanish or Valencian and I ended up having to sit through a loooot of Spanish conversations just listening passively (ex wasn't the most compassionate). This helped me pick out words in sentences rather than hearing \"vsddfdskfsdjf\" mushed together. *A big part of Spanish is listening and knowing where the words separate.* It's one thing to not know words but another when you don't even know where one word ends and another begins. So don't be afraid to just put it in the background even if you don't understand because you'll eventually learn where words end and begin through sheer repetition even if you don't get it.\n\nBroke up, learned a lot of Spanish songs during my single time, songs really helped me learn to pronounce well and have fun. You can have difficulties communicating with someone but you can sing together easy peazy and share a nice experience. I was about to leave the country feeling meh about my language acquisition after so much time spent here when I met a tinder cutie and ended up falling in love: spoke entirely in Spanish and this is where I boomed and had drastic changes and improvements. Falling in love is a great motivator.\n\nLater I decided to change my degree to Pharmacy since I always wanted to do something in science and man those first few classes were rough. I knew a fair amount of Spanish but half of the words were just so ridiculously tough. But then every day I noticed I understood more and more. And now I'm almost in my second semester, having passed all of my classes (although one took me two tries). And I learn dozens of new words every day, from words that all Spaniards know (ventosas, ampollas, liso, you know everything) to degree-specific words (esquizonte, falciparum, carbunco, etc.) to things I didn't even know in English. And I'm still learning every day.\n\nSo yeah, you hear my life story, but hopefully that gave you a lot of different ideas and sort of the natural evolution of what learning a language is like WITHOUT formal classes or grammar. Can I tell you all of the conjugations to poder and estar? Hell noooo brah not even like a third of them lmao. 99% of that stuff you just know from context. Accents too, you don't learn them, you just learn how to speak the word and then it just comes naturally. All of my friends too whenever they don't know an accent it's just like they say it slowly out loud then realize where the sound change comes from. And grammar is irrelevant because your general point comes across just fine; use the imperative if you're uncertain so someone can correct you but trust me nobody is not going to not understand you because you don't know conjugation.\n\nAnd lastly, when you start speaking with people, whether friends (which for me helped a bit) or with a partner (which for me was where I easily boomed with my Spanish speaking ability in like 3 months from talking like a toddler to being in a relationship and in a year after that to learning quantum physics in Spanish...even though I'd been in Spain for almost two years when I met him) , you need to NOT translate. Describe. Aw shit it's raining but you don't know what rain is? EL CIELO EST\u00c1 LLORANDO. Holy heck you saw this really cool earth worm but you have no idea what earth worms are? El bicho en el suelo con forma de espagueti, sabes? You need to practice describing not treating it like a math test.\n\nIf you want any other ideas hmu but I really do encourage you to watch videos, hear Spanish, listen to podcasts, make friends, meet a spanish qt on tinder, go to spanish restaurants and try to order in full spanish, take a vacation if you can, take a sewing class in spanish, literally just live your life but in Spanish. DON'T Waste your time or money on uni classes, you can take any language affirming exams (you know the A1 - C2 rank thing) for like $70 with a nice little proof certificate and your employer will recognize that, whereas two years of Spanish paid in full and you may not even be able to list it on a resume because if they come at you with a Spanish interview you'll just be like ????", "created_utc": "1574813882.0", "edited": "1574814362.0", "id": "f8txq0d", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_e1vnbq", "parent_id": "t3_e1vnbq", "score": "1", "subreddit": "learnspanish", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rd6d"}, {"author": "Anodynic", "body": "NBH, I think you have the right to do what you need to in order to feel better, as everyone grieves differently, but I also am not surprised by your sister's reaction as she too is grieving; it is probably difficult to reconcile that in July you were living normally with your husband, then he's gone, and now suddenly you're with a new guy.

You may want to instantly recoil at this; I'm not saying it's the age gap, I'm saying it's HIM and the circumstances. Yes, some age gaps work: I met my partner when I was 20 and he was 30 but I have always been fully independent in personality, outspoken, with hard boundaries. You say you never used to speak up and are only now just getting your voice to stand up for yourself after over half of a decade of this man disrespecting you and talking down to you.\n\nYes, some choices to move across the country work: I'm excelling in my career progress and he's only helping support me as I go through pharmacy school (with him being a pharmacist as well, funding my apartment). He isn't pushing me away, keeping me down, preventing me from having a life, etc. and in fact is very joyous and pleasant to be around, and makes my life BETTER not worse. And that said, I do have backup plans; while I hope we spend forever together, if for whatever reason it didn't work out, I know that I'd be OK. I have family to go back to, career potentials, my credits surely will be validated in the US, etc. I can genuinely say I am pushed up by him in many ways (and not held down in any) and he is one of my biggest supporters in me doing everything I want to; encouraging me to try new things, meet new people, travel, and it's excellent.\n\nThe fact that you have nowhere to go after living there for a while in the UK is really scary. If I ever needed some space from my partner for a few seconds, I'd have quite a few places to stay immediately and a ton of supportive friends in the country. It sounds like he may be isolating you, which is another sign of an abusive partner, besides the walking on eggshells, threatening words, anger...\n\nYes, some people get angry and have moments. Your partner's moments are happy ones. His anger seems to be his personality from what you seem to say. If my partner ever spoke to me threatening to force me home I would leave immediately, that is so scary and aggressive. You even seem to say that you're there because you're not in a position (I'm assuming financially) to take the kid away.\n\n28 year old men aren't attracted to 17 year old girls for their personalities.EDIT: And I'm sorry but there is no way you seemed 27-28 at 17.

This is normal, people mature and change well into their mid twenties (and I know I'm completely different every 6 months too and probably will be for the next few years.) Of course he isn't speaking to you or communicating, he does not view you as an equal and has probably never viewed you this way. I am sorry if that is mean but I think it is clear from everything you have said that he has always been reserved, not affectionate, angry, disrespectful and unpleasant.

Your situation is not normal. You are actively thinking about and indulging in fantasies on your ex and honestly emotionally cheating. Receiving bra-showing belly photos isn't okay, I don't care if she's pregnant, there are ways to show your belly approrpriately that don't involve everything hanging out in a private message to your ex.

Grow up and don't ruin a budding family over a pipe dream.

You were literal children just hanging out. That is totally different from who she is now as a pregnant adult, and isn't the real world.\n\nEven if you did get together it's likely it'd just be disappointing. \n\nTo be frank, the fact that you're living with your girlfriend and haven't even stopped thinking about your ex makes me think you and your girlfriend shouldn't be together.

It will only ruin her relationship with her child's father permanently, strain her relationship with her family, have a lot of people (namely father, father's family, her family, your girlfreind) mad at you, ruin two relationships (hers and yours) and you suddenly would become baby daddy to a kid that isn't yours. \n\nIt just isn't worth a second thought.", "created_utc": "1574720441.0", "edited": "False", "id": "f8qnbq1", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_e1np1b", "parent_id": "t3_e1np1b", "score": "1", "subreddit": "relationship_advice", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r0cn"}, {"author": "Anodynic", "body": ">She is still out right now .

My boyfriend knows about whistling, but I'm not rude about it. When we first started dating I told him I just didn't like some sounds, they bothered me and made me really upset and I can't help it, and it's not personal. I told him whistling was one, the same thing with people chewing loudly, same thing with dishes clinking, heavy breathing, etc. He respected that, and while he still is a habitual whistler, if he sees me in the room he whistles a second (habitually) then goes \"oops, forgot\" and it's over before I even really process it. If he does occasionally whistle a lot, I ask him not to whistle please that it is giving me a headache (and yes this is nicer than saying ITS PISSING ME OFF lol). He stops. All is nice and done.\n\nThat said, snoring and breathing are not controllable. My partner snores, chews, and talks in his sleep too. Snoring is worse with alcohol, and he consumes it frequently (it is Spain after all.) I just leave the room if he's snoring too loudly, he also bought me earplugs, and to be honest it hasn't really been a problem. We still sleep together just fine, and sometimes I'll take a sleeping pill to sleep on particularly bad nights. He also leaves to the couch if he wakes up a lot and realizes he's being grumpy/loud, it really does take two. I would never kick him out of his own bed over snoring, if I have a problem with it then I leave myself and come back in an hour when it's lightened down long enough for me to sleep.\n\nLastly, the breathing is a huge no-no to be pissed about. He cannot control it and it's totally unreasonable to expect someone to try to change the way they breathe because their own respiratory system annoys you. At that point you need to start working harder on yourself, try anti-anxiety medication, sleeping pills, go to a doctor, use earplugs, something, but the answer is not that he needs to breathe differently.\n\nI will tell you though, I dated someone before whose breathing upset me so much that I told him I couldn't watch Game of Thrones with him because he breathed and it annoyed me. It was normal, heavy breathing. We ended up breaking up before even getting to like three months together. My current partner has inaudible breaths, chews softly, walks softly, he's just not a rowdy dude. As horrible as it sounds, you may just be fundamentally incompatible.

I'm now studying Pharmacy in another language/country and boy was I surprised when I learned about orbitals being areas of probability rather than circles around a nucleus. I was the only one in class who didn't know. So embarrassing.\n\nTeach them Lewis Structures for molecules or at least basic concepts of orbitals/VSEPR. You don't need to go into the exact angles or hybridization or harder theories like molecular orbital theory but at least some simple quantum numbers and mechanics. It really helps with a lot of higher Chemistry courses and even if you stop at HS Chem at least you have a current understanding.\n\nWith the metric system/using the right units I think it's extremely important for globalization and internationalization. I recall in my high school classes both in mathematics and chemistry we often used cups, pints, quarts, etc. which aren't used internationally. Besides dimensional analysis as mentioned by other commenters, it's good for mastering scientific notation and just relative sizes of things. Ask your students how much they think a Liter is, then a mL, or a Kilogram, I bet they'd struggle with visualizing. Also, I recommend not comparing systems because that's always confusing and irrelevant (i.e. Gallon vs Liter) and rather just working entirely with the SI. Especially drive in what a \"Mol\" is, they need to know Avogadro's number 6.022 x 10\\^23 and how to use mol units/concentrations.\n\nTeach the concept of \"quantization\" as well. I recognize the biggest issue is that my general Chemistry/science teachers would always say \"oh well it's hard/doesn't matter unless you're going into a super science field/too advanced/irrelevant..etc\" and it was such a disservice. I think just explaining a lot of relevant concept in simple terms scattered throughout your lectures will really help. Limiting reactants \"well of course the reaction ends when it runs out of one of the ingredients\", heisenberg uncertainty being different from the observer effect, etc.\n\npH. Explain what it actually means. I heard every year that it was the scale of whether or not something was acidic or basic but couldn't actually explain what acidity was very well and still struggle with acid-base problems as well as these are concepts which constantly appear and build up in difficulty.\n\nLastly, in LAB assignments if you are from a high school which has the privilege of having microscopes, even if just a few, teach them how to use them/the basic structure of an optic microscope. And knowing how to read a meniscus. And, if possible/available, how to use bulb pipettes.\n\nMan, as a student there are so many things I wish were taught to me that would have made life a whole lot easier.\n\nI'd say redox as well but honestly save your students as I personally find that a bit too hard for regular chem and also irrelevant, but if you're doing for example AP chem then yes...redox as well...in both acidic and basic conditions.

Emotions are there for a reason, you need to listen to them 100% of the time; the only thing to learn is how to adequately respond. Why do you not tell him \"seriously what the fuck is wrong with you\" when he mentions hentai again? Why don't you tell him that it's gross, uncalled for, disrespectful? Why don't you ask him why in the world he's discussing porn with his friends in that context? Why would he think it's okay to kick you out of your own home so that he can masturbate to pornography? Why don't you express yourself when you are upset? Communicate your feelings and I feel you'll find that things end up going a lot easier for you; you can recognize the bullshit and disrespect really quickly and won't find yourself in situations where you suddenly realize you're stuck in the house with someone who breaks a lot of your boundaries and doesn't care about your feelings.\n\nAnd I am outraged for you and I don't think a lot of these top comments are really understanding. I used to be one of those same people who said things like \"porn is normal and healthy in relationships, everyone watches it, nobody is being harmed by consenting adults, etc.\" and then I saw the actual statistics. How damaging it is to almost every monogamous relationship. How many people do you think are actually 100% comfortable knowing that in their private time, their partner is using it to masturbate and fantasize about other things: hentai, other women, taboo subjects... It's just this common thing to say \"oh well everyone does it, I don't want to be one of THOSE women..\" who what? Stands up for themselves? And so many people actually do NOT consume it that it was very surprising to me to learn.\n\nHonestly, it could be a pornography addiction (which he does have considering how much he is damaging his own relationship with his girlfriend and friends) but on top of that you need to see how he treats you in other areas besides this one. Is he constantly ignoring your suggestions and making you feel bad? Does he invalidate your feelings? Do you feel comfortable having serious chats with him or is it more like walking on eggshells? Nobody can answer for you if this is a \"porn\" thing or if this is a bigger issue entirely of a pattern of disrespect. But I can say that it is not normal, it is not healthy, and no amount of you playing it down to your \"insecurities\" and trying to fix his personality deficits will ever fix things or make what is happening okay.

That said, I recommend this if you truly weigh contributions objectively; do you both contribute fairly or is one pulling more weight emotionally, financially, through cleanliness, meals, repairs, etc.? Is he selfless and does he do things for \"you\"/your family/guests too or is it just you doing it for him? Take those into consideration before going into a big chat just for some healthy perspective. After having had a good think about this, then have a sit down if you feel alright yeah I'm doing a lot more and it isn't balancing out in other areas of the relationship, we need to make cleaning even.\n\nTackle it as an \"We need to find a solution because I'm not going to be able to keep cleaning up after your guests\" rather than a \"you're lazy! You never clean\" and hopefully it will go well. I urge you to talk about these things as they come up rather than letting unfair routines and/or resentment build, and I urge you to NOT just leave the house messy and do your own thing without communication- you need to communicate first. \n\nCompromise if you want, or tell him that you're putting your foot in the ground and will not clean up after him, you do whatever you think is appropriate for the situation and in the context of your relationship, and honestly even if you do look and think \"wow I do clean a lot but you know he financially contributes, is very spontaneous, and is always cooking dinner/meal planning, so it really does balance out\" it still doesn't hurt to have a nice chat about feelings. It also may help to objectify the things you do: make a chore chart. Use a calendar and chart all the chores you did and how much time it took on that specific date. Include cleaning, cooking, bill paying, planning etc. and it will really help objectify the emotional labor as well as physical and financial in the relationship and could give both of you a lot to think about. \n\nCheers and good luck! I'm assuming since you're getting ready to marry this guy that this is probably out of the ordinary or just the one negative. Remember, everyone has sucky traits. If your fianc\u00e9 is just really shitty at chores then honestly it isn't the end of the world if all other aspects are great. Housekeepers are about 10-15 $/\u20ac an hour in most areas and could solve a lot of the resentment. \"x minute clean up times\" a day where both of you spend x amount of time cleaning without fail will leave your place spotless. And please don't hold things back, ESPECIALLY before you are married! You need to test ALL of the waters and get to know someone 110% before pledging to spend your life with them. If chronic laziness when it comes to cleaning is a dealbreaker, this is something that needs to be known beforehand.

Did you never have a family to cook for you as a child so you walked into the house and smelled the wonderful aroma of food? Have you not ever walked past someone's window with a freshly made or cooking meal and thought \"man, that smells amazing, I would love to be a guest in their home right now!\" Do you even enjoy the smell of your own food? How and what kind of things do you cook where it is apparently so pungent in the walls of your space? \n\nI live in an open concept apartment too, cook daily, and it never smells bad. Do you not clean the kitchen every day after cooking? I genuinely am baffled by you- my ex was the same way; always wanted to shut all the doors and open windows to get out the \"food smell.\" Like, what smell!? Pure deliciousness?! \n\nHere is my recommendation: keep a very clean apartment. It's not that hard to do as long as you spend at least 10-15 minutes tidying a day. While cooking, clean the dishes and utensils you use, don't let anything harden or get a funky/old smell. Use the above stove ventilator in the case of strongly spiced foods (such as channa masala). Avoid splashes from grease and sauce as much as possible and wipe down the counters after each time you cook. If your kitchen is previously clean, it takes like 5 minutes in total to re-clean it after/while cooking. The only time food has an unpleasant home odor is when you're cooking extremely spicy food and don't ventilate, or when you are just overall not that clean and allow food to turn into bad odors. But even strongly-spiced food still smells delicious....I have never had food smells \"permeate\" into the walls before. \n\nI swear it is like you and everyone like you are an absolute anomaly to me.

You don't have any solid reason. It'd be understandable if something big happened, but you kind of sound wishy washy. You planned to spend the rest of your life with this woman and now you're totally separated and haven't spoken in over a year. And you don't have a huge reason, just \"I moved and didn't socialize as much.\" That to me sounds like you were looking outside of the marriage because you were upset that she moved. I don't know what the actual case is, but that's exactly how it came off and would be an enormous red flag.\n\nPlus I think it's kind of strange in the vibe in which you describe the divorce like it \"just happened\". You made a life commitment to someone! One of the ideologically strongest bonds between a couple, a pinky promise to love and cherish each other until you get old and die. But you \"ended up getting divorced?\" You say it casually and very passively. The way you say it honestly makes me think you don't take commitment seriously and probably are the greatest common denominator of why you have nobody close to you (not trying to bully you here, just give you an honest female perspective.) You need to be honest about what made you destroy that bond. What was so terrible that you wanted a divorce? And yes, I understand, people sometimes \"grow apart\" but you cannot honestly blame someone for seeing that as a red flag. It just comes off as so...wishy washy. Like, I'd constantly be on edge with someone like you wondering if you'd just wake up one day and decide you didn't love me anymore and want a divorce.\n\nYou sound apathetic and passive about it. You sound unusually calm. I know it's been a few years, but at least people tend to have compelling reasons. You cannot expect someone to trust you if you don't open up. And you cannot expect someone to wonder why, after being in your late twenties, you cut all ties with your family and got a divorce and moved away (although logically it has it's reasons, you need to be candid). And again, I get your parents or siblings being abusive, but aunts? Uncles? Grandparents? Second cousins? Close friends who you just call brother/sister? Their parents who have \"adopted\" you in? People always have a support system. It's just part of living in a society. \n\nYou won't scare anyone away by being brutally honest and open, you're scaring people away by seeming non-commital, passive, and like you don't understand the gravity of these actions. You are in your right to divorce someone who you don't love and to cut ties with your entire family, but they're absolutely intelligent and extremely in the right to find that as a red flag, especially considering you give zero good explanation for having literally nobody.

And if you don't it's food waste. And considering most food is heavily processed it just isn't good after a few hours of waiting, too, thus more desire to eat it all in one sitting even if it's too much and more having to buy/make a full meal if the food you saved went bad or had a funky texture from being out after a while. In Spain they have literally tapas for dinner parties where people just nibble on food and drink wine and then go home. Here a light piece of bread with some ham and toast is considered a good meal. And processed food tastes like crap here, and a lot of things just don't exist. Coffee creamer powder that packs a lot of calories, nope. Coffee is generally taken a lot stronger (i.e. less sugar.) Sweet flavors are less commonly eaten in all meals, and the dessert shops here are generally filled with more flaky pastry type dishes than cupcakes and cookies.\n\nIt's also cheaper here to have fruits, veggies and clean protein than McDonalds where I can say honestly in the U.S. it's generally the same price or cheaper to get premade frozen food, fast food, etc. Also a lot more delivery options and less fancy restaurants, whereas here it is vice versa.

Unfortunately, three month old kids and a stressful job emergency had her hands full. Her husband admits that not attending to this job emergency could have cost her this job, it was an unusual situation (i.e. something she's not used to handling) and she was also alone with her newborn baby. Plus they have a second dog. She also immediately went to go to the vet as soon as work ended, and her baby was sick.\n\nI don't think she probably even thought about her dog having diarrhea because she was panicking over her baby possibly dying, and was also sleep deprived and really stressed. I think you'd understand a bit more my perspective if you read an award winning article about the parents who [forget their babies in hot cars.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/magazine/fatal-distraction-forgetting-a-child-in-thebackseat-of-a-car-is-a-horrifying-mistake-is-it-a-crime/2014/06/16/8ae0fe3a-f580-11e3-a3a5-42be35962a52_story.html)These parents simply forgot and it cost them their own child. She didn't forget out of neglect but just an unfortunate series of circumstances which led the dog diarrhea to be forgotten in the mind because she was tired from the unexpected work emergency until 7 pm and then freaking out that her baby was dying.\n\nIn a normal work day it wouldn't put your employment at risk, but at an emergency which even angry OP has admitted she had to attend to and wouldn't have been able to do so while going to the vet is not a normal work day. Additionally, she is the breadwinner, if she loses that job her entire family suffers. Unfortunately when your job is what keeps the roof over your head, your husband's head, the dogs head, the baby's head, etc. it isn't something you can risk in certain situations, such as the emergency one.\n\nI don't know if she would have been able to even attend to the dog besides petting even on a lunch break as she'd be making lunch, checking on her kid/feeding her three month old, etc. Babies tend to consume all attention, and with the baby and work and dog diarrhea being common it is not surprising she was not able to be extremely attentive to the dog. Additionally we simply don't know enough to know how the symptoms were. If it was a low dose, the dog really could have shown minimal symptoms like a diarrhea or two and then just passed of kidney failure two days later. If it was a high dose and she didn't notice or ignored seizures or something then that would have been horrifying, but considering OP said the symptoms were \"maybe\" diarrhea and the dog acting weird, then it doesn't say much either way.\n\nLastly, she finished work at 7 and went to go instantly. The baby was red so she rushed out to the ER with her baby in mind, as she should have. Diarrheas in dogs are generally not fatal, whereas allergic reactions often are, and unfortunately it was just a horrible set of coincidences which led to the dog dying alone. But I don't think it's her fault what happened, because she didn't poison the dog, and she didn't intentionally neglect the dog. In the emergency from work and caring for her baby, she called OP and asked what to do, she called her mom to come over when she was done, she instantly went to go for the vet and unfortunately in that moment her baby presented signs of an unknown allergic reaction on his body and she panicked and prioritized the baby, which should always happen. Baby over dog.\n\nIt is hard for OP to separate his anger, but his wife didn't do anything outwardly malicious and in fact was busy keeping the household together.

His wife didn't poison the dog and neither did he, but he seems to be blaming her an awful lot for having other obligations that prevented her from rushing to the vet, and not himself for not being there either, which is unfair.

Which is not uncommon. Especially considering that pitbulls are VERY high energy and also would be distracting while she's working.

That said, pitbulls are extremely energetic and I wouldn't be surprised if it was barking or poorly behaved considering OP is gone all the time and it's outside a lot. No excuse for someone killing it, but it wasn't your wife putting it outside that killed the dog, it was probably the sick criminal who gave food laced with antifreeeze to the dog. It's surprising that as someone who works in \"animal welfare\" you would not immediately consider this possibility.

No wonder your wife is so freaking anxious, she has an absolute airhead for a husband.\n\n>I'm absolutely furious with her. She neglected that poor dog.\n\nNo, she didn't. That is NOT neglect. Being outside in late summer weather, presumably in a large fenced in backyard, being fed and watered and played with, is not neglect. She noticed the dog was acting weird on Saturday, immediatey, thus she was clearly attentive to it even though it was outside. She called you about it. She made a plan to go to the vet immediately after work.\n\nAlso, she's a MOM and the PRIMARY BREADWINNER who had to work from home, and now you expect her to be dog mommy too? You sound like you have zero respect for all of the roles she does. You sound like you don't understand what working from home is. You seem like you think it's fine that she's a babysitter and a dogsitter and a housecleaner while being a lawyer because \"she's at home\" but you're dead wrong. Working at home means work at home. You have to focus. It's exactly as if she's at work, but isn't. She can't be doing everything else at the same time, and she couldn't leave until her shift ended. You say you work a lot, but she makes the most money, so not only is she the primary caretaker for a dog, a kid, and a husband, but also she's a freaking lawyer, with high stress. Yet \"you had to leave for the weekend\" knowing she has to work overtime as well and didn't even care about finding a dogsitter or someone to walk the dog? YOU HAVE A THREE MONTH OLD CHILD. Dude! She's practically a single mom. Why don't you quit your job and take care of the kid and your pitbull if you don't like it? It sounds like you really don't contribute very much to this family except with whining and problems.\n\n>He would never have gotten into antifreeze if she didn't have her stupid belief of \"outside dogs\" and let him roam.\n\nNo, many people let their dogs roam around in the backyard and have this belief. Animals are not humans. I like dogs as much as the next person (except for aggressive ones) but if he has a doggy house, food and water, shelter, and isn't out in extreme weather conditions, there is nothing wrong with it. A dog is a dog and they are not small humans. A pitbull is a dog that was bred to be able to handle \"outside\" conditions as well.\n\n>She never even TRIED to take him to the vet.\n\nYes she did according to what you wrote. After raising your child ALONE, taking care of the two dogs ALONE and working until 19:00 on a SATURDAY, she called her mom to be able to watch the baby to take the dog immediately after work but your CHILD was bright red. Child > pitbull. What if your baby had a life threatening allergic reaction and died because your wife decided to take Cabo (who she saw as weird but fine) to the vet instead of her own child to the hospital? It was a shit coincidence, but she prioritized the correct one here. She was literally out the door to go but your child took priority. And then it's no wonder she was hyper focused on her own baby. And very few vets would be open probably by the time everything was taken care of, but who would be there to watch the baby? Not you. Your wife can't do everything.\n\n>We got into a screaming fight where she accused me of valuing a BLEEPING dog over her ability to support \"this family\" (she is the higher earner by a lot) and our child, who was \"in the HOSPITAL\". The baby had an allergic reaction. She wasn't dying.\n\nShe isn't wrong. Your baby could have been dying. You wouldn't have known had she gone into the hospital. And quite frankly, if you weren't gone all the time you would have been around to take your dog to the vet rather than making your wife do absolutely everything. Honestly what happened was a tragedy but it is in no way your wifes fault and she did nothing wrong except quite frankly decide to keep the dog rather than rehome it, since you are clearly not a responsible owner and cannot manage your work/social life whereas your own BADASS breadwinner WIFE can work, take care of a newborn and multiple dogs at the same time.\n\n>I know she didn't directly harm the dog, but her apathy towards them\n\nNot them. The large, probably hyperactive pitbull. Who really is an outside dog. By outside dog it means too much energy to be in the house. The fluffy small one is in the house and seemingly fine (and doesn't have the excess energy to require it to leave except to potty), and she also clearly was attentive to the outside dog considering she noticed immediately something was wrong and kept him fed/taken care of. IT IS NOT HER FAULT SOMEONE POISONED YOUR DOG WITH ANTIFREEZE. You need to get that in your head.\n\n>The fact that this incident could get me fired (I work in animal welfare)\n\nNow you're just being histrionic.

Narcissists hurt those around them without care, thus excusing themselves from receiving as much empathy. Mental illness is very varied, but for example pedophilia is one that does harm society and children. They get very little empathy even if they haven't hurt anyone for the potential harm they can cause. Meanwhile someone with OCD isn't perceived as a threat to society because running back home for the third time to make sure you remembered to turn off the lights every day of your life doesn't really hurt anyone but yourself.\n\nEDIT: And in my personal opinion, personality disorders are a lot different from other mental illnesses in that it's kind of just who you are as a person. Histrionic, borderline, antisocial, narcissistic, etc. make for relatively \"regular\" folks with generally undesirable personality traits that affect society. It doesn't really have an \"easy treatment\" either as it's who you are as a person, whereas depression, anxiety, schizophrenia, etc. can be managed with multiple treatments, being a narc just kind of means you have a habit of being a self centered prick.

For me it's anxiety that is so bad that I do need medicine to control it and often a tranquilizer (OTC sleeping pills or prescribed benzo anxiety medicine). University is one of the most stressful times in your life, so don't be ashamed for needing help if you do.  \n\nSet many different alarms one minute apart over a long span, so that way if you snooze or toss it or whatever it will still keep ringing. What actually helps me is getting up early enough to have a solid game of TFT (League of Legends), or to watch a few videos on YouTube, or to browse Reddit, so it's not instant panick and sleepy rush. This gives me time to relax and drink coffee/Monster, prepare for the day, and be showering happily. Add vibrations to your alarm and have the ringtone one that slowly comes on so that it isn't so anxiety inducing in the morning, BEEP BEEP BEEP is a lot less pleasant to wake up. For me for a long time (until my roommates complained lol) I kept the periodic table song as my ringtone because I'd wake up when ASAPScience said \"And now ASAP Science presents...the periodic table!\" and I'd sing along to \"hydrogen and helium and lithium beryllium...\" A song that you enjoy singing is surprisingly nice to wake up to.\n\nAlso, don't pee before you go to bed if you are a heavy sleeper through the night. The urge to pee gets me out of bed and prevents me from falling back asleep in the morning more than anything, but if it'll wake you up at night to go pee then it is counterproductive. Only works for deep sleepers.  \n\nWindows either cracked or the blinds completely up if regular street sound/streetlights won't wake you up in the middle of the night. Birds chirping, a casual breeze and ESPECIALLY the sunlight on your face is a good way to wake up, keeping the blinds closed fakes yourself into thinking it's still dark outside even when it is not. \n\nLastly, piece of advice: Prepare your backpack, clothing, etc. for the morning of. This week I have 09:30 labs which will last until 13:30 approximately and then classes from 15:00 to 20:00. That's basically meaning I need to be up around 08:00 (if I want a game of League of Legends) to 08:30 (If I just want 5 minutes for coffee) and my only break until arriving at home (which is 15 minutes from the University, so 20:15 at the earliest) will be lunch and a 30 minute between class break. I don't want to spend that precious time in the morning getting my backpack ready and you shouldn't either. Prepare the MOST possible the night before to make the mornings an easy breeze and part of that \"relax\" time rather than \"work\" time. Anxious mornings suck ass.

Where I live in Spain, having housekeepers is very common. The standard rate is about 10\u20ac.  Generally if it's every 2 weeks it'll be 3 hours to clean, so 30\u20ac. OP said the other father complained about \"cheap\" labor, he also said it took a good few hours for all THREE of them to do the kitchen, bathrooms, garden. Assuming it took 3 hours and James was only paid \u00a310, being paid \u00a33,34 an hour is ridiculously cheap labor. I also lived in the UK before, and the average rate was HIGHER, at \u00a311-\u00a315/hr in Hillingdon.\n\nPlus when you go to someone else's house as a polite person you generally become a yes-man, you don't argue with your friend's parents. Your son barely brings friends over and the rare time he does it was met with a \"no son, I'm cleaning rn, you'll be in the way.\" What options do they have then? The friend and him are already there, what do they do? Clean or leave.  \n\n\nThey both probably just wanted to chill together, so the friend, being polite and a good guest, is like \"need any help?\" This was probably only offered because again, his only options at that point were to help clean to possibly stay or to leave. OP took it upon himself to be like HELL YEAH thanks for offering kind stranger, and had them deep clean the house for HOURS. Then he only paid the guy like \\~\u00a33 an hour...and by the time they were done he probably barely spent any time with Danny...It feels like a whole bundle of miscommunication but I feel like OP really read the situation wrong where he took a polite offhanded comment from a friend who just really wanted to chill with Danny to mean extensive labor of the entire property and then paid the kid at a wage lower than Chinese workshop laborers...Like \u20ac10 is for one hour for my housekeeper and she's not even trained, just a family friend...\n\nNext time OP, just tell your son and friend to stay in his room while they hang out and that's it. I don't see why cleaning the garden was even relevant to this kid hanging out, too. \"You'll be in the way, I'm cleaning\" why didn't you let him stop once the cleaning moved outside? How will them chilling in the house affect the cleaning in the garden? OP, NAH but I really think you just are kind of daft socially...put yourself in the kid's shoes. I think you took a bit of advantage and then barely paid the guy. It's not like he's your kid either (it makes sense not to pay your kid since it's his home too and adulting/being in a normal family means everyone cleans, but some stranger's kid HELL YES you pay them omg).

I think when it's kind of generalized like I'm uggo what do I fix or I hate my face tell me what I need it is most likely insecurity moreso than anything and they should be confident within themselves before deciding what to do. Imo plastic surgery is just to enhance yourself or correct the one or two things you dislike about yourself not getting 500 implants to look like Kylie. \n\nIn cases where people are mentally healthy, it can be helpful when you have a specific thing you want to fix and don't know how to do it. For example, I am very confident but if I had the right circumstances I'd absolutely fix:\n\n1. The tiniest bump on my nose, just to flatten it out. It's a sexy nose but from the side it looks like someone had a video game slider and made the nose slightly bigger than the default, you know what I mean? It wouldn't change my life though if I had it done and I doubt people would notice.\n2. Under eye circles. Not puffiness, but severe sunkenness. I doubt there's anything but filler (and needle below my eye while awake for me is a NOPE) but I'd love to know if there was a fix because it makes me look really sick and unhealthy all the time and I hate people asking if I had enough sleep lmao yup just my face.\n3. Baby chin. I am very skinny but I have the smallest chin and it pulls my skin so when I smile the corners of my mouth are down and when I talk on the side you can see my tongue muscle move heavily like a lil frog. I also had to get five teeth removed with braces because they were crowded and overlapping because of my small af jaw. That's the one that I think would be lifechanging if I could fix and I have no idea where I got it- my mom has a beautiful upturned smile and my dad a big jaw.  \n\nThat said, I don't have any plans in the next 5 years to even ask about any of this, but hell maybe when I graduate if I have a nice job and some money I'll fish around and if it's low risk f yeah lemme be extra hot. But again, I really think that as a plastic surgery sub we should be able to recognize when people are mentally healthy and just want to correct certain things and need a bit of help and support from people who have been there vs when people are dysmorphic and dislike their physical attributes (who still need support but not in the form of what surgeries to get).

Trans people are an extremely loud and aggressive minority towards any perceived slight almost always and often will consider your statement that you are not attracted to trans people as a literal act of violence, and any discourse not totally praising being trans is often filled with downvotes. So do not be surprised if you lose Amanda as a friend, all of the ones who introduced you to this person, and she will probably go around calling you transphobic behind your back as well. \n\nIf they were at all rational, they would have just said \"I felt really humiliated, hurt and upset, and am not interested in being friends.\" or would have said \"I didn't know that you were not aware that I was trans\" and could have chosen to either forgive or just move on. The fact that they went straight to insulting you, victimizing themselves and proclaiming you are transphobic like the rest speaks pretty poorly on their character.\n\nTake this as a huge lesson, do not try to contact them further, be pretty upset at your friends for setting you up to fail, and be careful vocalizing your lack of attraction to trans as this will get you ostracized from most communities.

Let's compare arms to see how white you are.\" This is just life.\n\nIs it kinda rude sometimes? Sure. Can people be insulting or offensive? Occasionally, but most people just reiterate these comments as like a talking point. They probably don't have a lot in common with an 18 year old kid. It's honestly like when people meet tall people and they're always like \"wow you are so tall!\" Why do people say that? They have nothing better to say. It's small talk. And I know every person reading this comment can think back and remember that super tall person and you nervously make a wow haha i had to strain my neck to see ya! That's the type of innocuous commenting. Would you call OP's parents abusive if they were just commenting on how he should do basketball or should be careful to knock his head on the frame due to height as little tidbits whenever they visited? absolutely not. mildly annoying at best.\n\nListen, if it makes you uncomfortable just tell them to stop commenting on your skin. Say, come on guys, I am really healthy promise. I go outside promise. I wear sunscreen promise. But I don't like these comments. But as a very pale person who does get these comments all the time, it's EXTREMELY frequent and I genuinely cannot remember a time it was actually malicious.

These days people are so offended by literally everything. OP, you said they made comments which you laughed off, That's the right way to handle it, because they're legitimately not trying to hurt feelings. Then you say, \"  They could tell that I wad clearly uncomfortable \". how???? Did you talk to them???

I thought that was exaggerating but just funny. They always remind me to put on sunscreen and his mom even gave me a face cream and told me to wear it every day for protection.\n\nHis 8 year old niece who is really dark because her mom is from Latin America and her father from UAE also commented a ton and even begged me to show her my stomach the first few times I saw her so we could compare colors (again mega lmao).

When I was entering freshman year I was so uncomfortably shy that I ran away literally almost in tears from meeting my first boyfriend's brother. I was cringy, awkward, uncomfortable, it embarrassed me to be called on in class, every time I spoke I replayed it over and over and over.\n\nSophomore year of high school I was convinced by a guy I had a crush on to join the Speech and Debate team. That crush was instantly squashed after hearing he talked badly about me, and it made me almost not want to do it. I was so shy. The only reason I didn't drop out was because it was too late to do so. But I practiced with teachers after school in the mandatory practices, and I also went to the extra class for speech and debate. I was still shy though and couldn't project my voice whenever anyone was around. OP, in this case, would have told me I can either suck it up or drop out, and that I wasn't fit for this group, and that I wouldn't get anywhere in life if I kept acting like a socially awkward spoiled brat.\n\nBut no, what happened was I had a teacher that cared. I didn't really know him before or after, but Mr. Brown told me that I needed to get up there and project my voice. That there was nothing to be afraid of. To look at him while I speak and he had me get on stage in front of the whole class during practices and read my prose at the top of my lungs without screaming, but enough to project to the back of the room. At that moment I didn't like him, I was sooo embarrassed, and I remember it plain as day. But it worked. Slowly but surely he had me do that every time until I finally projected my voice during practices. I ended up getting 5th-6th places in a lot of speech and debate competitions (prose, humorous interp., storytelling.)\n\nI switched schools and ended up in two more different high schools after that, my last one having another speech class but without a club, where, surprise surprise, I ended up winning the big class debate at the end. I was really blessed to have that experience with that teacher who I otherwise really did not bond with. He barely knew me and was nothing more than just \"my teacher\" and definitely got along way better with most other students but he was an excellent educator and really did his job well. I always did great at group projects after that. And now, in University, I continue excelling and actually have done promotional videos for my University, am constantly being begged to join their group for group presentations, and am a very happy public speaker. I still am nervous and shake but I tense and wiggle my toes as taught and push through it even with my voice breaking and heart racing.\n\nMy entire life would have been different if Mr. Brown had been OP. Period. Teachers are lifechanging, and students are there to learn. Nobody is born or grows up perfect. Social anxiety can be managed. I now still take xanax for when I have massive panic attacks but they are never caused by being in public or speaking in public anymore. And I am a very successful, functioning adult even anxious as hell, all things considered. So while I get your point, I feel due to my anecdotal experiences that OP's reaction was the opposite of what she needed. It isn't OP's job to fix, no, but to teach and guide, yes.\n\nA better response would have been to have her give a preview in front of him, or to give her public speaking tips (look at foreheads, don't make eye contact, sweep your view across the room, wiggle your toes and tense them while speaking to relieve tension, practice your speaking a lot, etc.) Or just anything except for his reaction really. He didn't have to give her anything but a no, but he could have delivered no much kinder, and worked with his student more than being such a stickler.", "created_utc": "1568149496.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ezuchu9", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_d297h0", "parent_id": "t1_ezu86jz", "score": "7", "subreddit": "AmItheButtface", "subreddit_id": "t5_22x5u9"}, {"author": "Anodynic", "body": "Haha nope. As a girl who has experienced my fair share of abuse as well and isn't a dirty cheater, there are literally zero excuses for someone to go back to an abusive ex with a new boyfriend.\n\nAnd to spend weekends with your ex? Honestly I'd probably believe she was lying about the abuse just to keep the new boyfriend not suspicious about their communications. Those excuses are so flimsy-- \"he might be feeding her lies about you\" so that is suddenly validation to spend the night with your ex? \"He might be blackmailing her with old pictures or saying he'll break the two of you up\" doesn't need to do any of that with her actively sleeping with him and spending her free time with him.\n\nI can see someone innocent who gets roped back into the abusive partner when SINGLE, yes, but with a new partner, nope nope nope.

I went to four different high schools due to my mom\u2019s job. She didn\u2019t have to move but chose to take new jobs annually for a raise. We were poor, to the point where all of my clothes came from Goodwill and we had to sometimes go to food banks. All of our stuff was in boxes. I was shy and could never relate to all that best friend stuff because I was always moving. And I HATED moving.\n\nSeven and a half years ago, I was you. I was 15, and going to my SECOND high school. I had eighth grade in West Virginia, ninth grade in an excellent charter school in California which I loved and now was going to a boring small town in Kentucky, at the small, boring town where Kim Davis worked. Needless to say I was miserable. It felt unfair that everyone already knew each other and I was finishing the last two weeks of freshman year as the new girl. I won\u2019t lie, that time was sad. It was hard. I feel you. But I can tell you what happened next.\n\nI met a person who encouraged me to join the speech and debate team. This gave me friends, confidence, and an immediate sense of belonging in an otherwise unknown place. I made tons of memories and a few great friends I still talk to to this day. I ended up going to two more high schools, (one in WA state the last in Indiana) but I focused on academics, joining clubs (leadership, environmental club, big brother big sister after school). I made so many memories and had so much fun. By the time I graduated we had a totally different financial situation from when I was 15, and we had enough money to get me braces and so I could shop.\n\nThe traveling and moving ended up leaving me as a confident, bold adult who handles instability and changes in environment well. I ended up living all over the states and the moving gave me opportunities to live in London and Spain too, where I now live and study. I have public speaking skills, know another language, have friends from all around the world, and I wouldn\u2019t be the same person if it hadn\u2019t been for those childhood cross country moves to dinky small towns.\n\nListen, you are beautiful and strong. Go out there and make friends, join clubs, and force yourself to get involved with the community. Be confident even if you don\u2019t feel it. You\u2019re the cool new girl and you are about to have so many new opportunities. You have a clean slate and the world and your past at your fingers. Think of it as an exciting step forward. Trust me when I say it may suck now but one day you are going to look back and realize this is a huge character builder and gave you so many opportunities and experiences that kids who never moved just will never have. You are going to flourish into a confident young adult who isn\u2019t afraid of new situations, with a ton of cool experiences from all over, who is bold and brave and beautiful and with interesting stories to tell.

I was answering this dude\u2019s honest question about a preference. Your personal insistence that I am somehow a terrible person who hates bisexual people is also a pretty great reason to say avoid this type of person. I am not a cheater but I have been CHEATED on which is part of the reason why hell no I do not accept this funny business with friends or exes. Go to survivinginfidelity or relationship advice or literally any forum where people who try too hard to be the \u201ccool girl\u201d end up. It happens all the time. \n\nI was not implying that bi people are more inclined to cheat or any of that nonsense that shows you either lack reading comprehension or want to choose me as an enemy because I exclude your people from my dating pool. It is specifically due to the fact that bisexual people, in the same situations as everyone else, would be statistically likely to find more people attractive. If I was with a bisexual person I would hold my standards about boundaries to everyone, and that would be unfair to them. I would either feel like I\u2019m controlling them or like the \u201ccool girl\u201d and it wouldn\u2019t be fair to either of us. \n\nAnd to answer the thing you stated elsewhere, I don\u2019t give a rats ass about the other person\u2019s sexuality, I wouldn\u2019t be cool with my partner having a sleepover with a hypothetical lesbian friend because it\u2019s not about them it\u2019s about me. So yes, I wouldn\u2019t want my hypothetical bi guy in a sleepover with a straight guy too. The straight guy isn\u2019t in the hypothetical relationship with me, the bi guy is. \n\nDo you think cheaters are just born this way? Not always. I genuinely do believe a large majority of the cases are people who felt attraction and had opportunities to act on it. Drunk with people at club, at business conference with \u201cwork wife,\u201d at her bachelorette party with a stripper, hanging out with best friend who you think just \u201cgets\u201d you, those are situations in which people who otherwise wouldn\u2019t cheat tend to. So rather than let it get too far to seem cool, I nip that shit in the bud, and hold myself to the same standards. I don\u2019t go clubbing without partner, won\u2019t have typical bachelorette party, no close guy friends to accidentally fall into an emotional affair with, and hold my partner to those same standards.\n\nLastly, I don\u2019t specifically call them out. I was responding to a comment asking but why do women not date bi people I would like her reasoning and since everyone was like wow u aren\u2019t entitled to that answer I was like ffs ill give him my insight then.\n\nMy type isn\u2019t specifically about bi people either. I like olive skinned dark haired spanish speaking guys (my last three boyfriends and all of my dates in the us, uk and spain have been this type). I don\u2019t like super chatty guys because I\u2019m super chatty so I prefer a listener. I prefer an introvert. I prefer someone stable and with no history of cheating and vanilla. And lastly, I would still date a bisexual if they actually fit the above and were compatible with my boundaries. But I assume most wouldn\u2019t be, due to the aforementioned reasons in my other post. Given my type, it goes without saying that of course I would date people who weren\u2019t olive skinned and dark haired, my first boyfriend was a pasty blonde chatty cali guy, another was a dark mexican immigrant, and I have, in fact, dated a bisexual. But in general I tend to often be attracted to those types (and being in Spain it\u2019s easy to find my type).\n\nI understand it may be easier to demonize the person with a dissenting opinion but that is life. Not everyone feels the same way. It doesn\u2019t mean I am evil, just that I have my own type.

And I hold myself to the same standards. I'm not friends with my exes or besties with a guy, although obviously I have many male acquaintances and interact with them, and vice versa with my partners.\n\nWhen it comes to bisexual men, now it's basically double the hypothetical scrutiny and competition. There are less boundaries now- guy nights, girl nights, basically any event you will certainly have someone you'd be likely to be attracted to all the time. It's just more stress. And before literally everyone comes out of the woodworks acting like this is some antiquated, traditional, alien, foreign concept- most people I know in real life think this way, it's in movies, it's clearly traditional thought, and while most people won't outright admit it, I'd reckon the majority really do think this way.\n\nWith boyfriends you can just say, well no sleeping in bed with female friends and it's like well, duh. But with bisexual boyfriends what, can they never go have a bro's night out camping or in bed because they could be attracted to all their guy friends too? I'm not even particularly insecure either, but I think most people in hetero relationships wouldn't want their partners having sleepovers with their attractive similar aged opposite sex even if you're just friends, because of what it looks like, social conventions, and it just feels inappropriate. Now double the competition to everyone, and it just is too much. And people on Reddit will soapbox about how that is so awful and blah blah but then go to literally all of the relationships subreddits and you will see these same people but now on throwaways crying because of these exact scenarios of jealousy, inappropriate behaviors, crossing boundaries, etc. \"I\u00b4m not like the other x in relationships\" is way too common, and unfortunately every day there are new users to survivinginfidelity and relationships subreddits who fell victim to ignoring social conventions and getting cheated on or disrespected or having boundaries stomped on.\n\nBasically a bisexual guy requires a very, extremely confident partner and/or excellent boundaries. And no person is perfect, so you're bound to have issues occasionally. It's easy to be pissed at your boyfriend for dancing at night with a girl or chatting hours on end even if they're just friends because duh, that's weird in social conventions and comes off as inappropriate. People around him may even talk behind his back about his poor girlfriend. But if you're bisexual then what, can you not have any friends? of course you can. But basically all of the boundaries that hetero relationships have easily defined based on sex distinguishing (don't hang out one on one with opposite sex at night, no sleepovers, no exaggerated compliments, no showering with opposite sex friends etc.) dissipate with a bisexual because Jim and Jane could be equally as potentially attractive to them, so you don't have any of those standard obvious conventions like you do with two straight people.\n\nI would shower and change with my girlfriend because we're both straight girls, but NEVER with another man for the obvious! But now with a bi guy, what if he needs a shower after hanging out with his bro? Essentially it pigeon-holes the partner into either feeling controlling by now dictating no sleepovers/showers/blah with ANY friend of ANY sex unless it's 100% no attraction, which of course is controlling, or it leads to the partner having to reluctantly accept guy/guy scenarios which they would RESENT if it was a guy/girl scenario, feeling disrespected and with boundaries smashed.\n\nAnyways sorry if that's a bit rambly but you haven't gotten a proper answer and it's because people get lambasted on Reddit for saying the truth, or a billion people come out and say BUT NOT I; but real life demographics and reddit demographics are much different as well. IRL This is what I feel like ,and also maaaany people I have known. It is not that we care that you bone dudes as well, I mean maybe some do but I personally don't, it's that it complicates the whole relationship and literally all social scenarios you will ever be in and your partner has to personally define rules and boundaries based on people rather than the standard social convention and it's a lot.\n\nOverall, it seems unfair for me to date a bi guy because I have a lot of boundaries. I wouldn't want my boyfriend sleeping over with another female friend, but I wouldn't care if he had a sleepover with a guy friend. Now let's say he was bisexual, I would honestly have an issue with the guy friend sleepover then. Equality means equality, so what socially is unconventional for guys in relationships to do with females that isn't their partner now applies to EVERYONE with bi guys. I hope you have perhaps understood what I was trying to convey. I get it isnt fair, and that is why I don't date bi men, because from a human perspective I get wanting to hang out and spend time with your friends, but at the same time from a relationship perspective there have to be differences between what you do with female friends and what you do with me, but if you're attracted to both genders welp then you can't do those inappropriate things with guys either.\n\nTl;dr does your sexuality make me uncomfortable? No. Bone dudes all you want, I have zero problem with it. It's the jealousy, added competition, and traditional \"don't sleep with your opposite sex friend and other common sense boundaries in a typical relationship\" needing to be applied now to literally both sexes which  would make a relationship difficult and unfair on both ends.\n\nAnd again, the reason why people don't elaborate on their types is because it obviously isn't socially acceptable to just admit these things straight out. But everyone has their reasons for dating exclusion, and \"x-phobia\" or whatever isn't always the case. You don't have to be racist to not want to date someone of a certain race, you don't have to be xenophobic to not want to date someone outside of your culture, you don't have to be transphobic to not want to date a trans person, you don't have to be a bigot to not want to date a bisexual.

Since this seems to apply to all of your life aspects, I\u2019d suggest even further doing lists, organizing, etc.\n\nFood for example; don\u2019t be the \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d when asked what you want to eat. If you\u2019re insecure about what your wife wants say \u201cI was thinking either x or y\u201d but at least this shows you taking a baby step in a more assertive approach. Buy food and have it half prepared for when wife comed home, or tell her \u201ci bought xyz ingredients so we can have xyzxyz for dinner tonight.\u201d She doesn\u2019t necessarily have to like all of your choices but I\u2019m sure she will be so grateful you are at least taking initiative. When you want something like a craving too tell her; man I really want pizza tonight, let\u2019s order. And lastly if you really feel nervous one night and can\u2019t pick or just have no idea, here\u2019s a fun tip my male friends taught me: make her guess.\n\nThat\u2019s right. You ask her what she wants for dinner and she doesn\u2019t know (and/or just doesn\u2019t feel like deciding) but you don\u2019t either. So ask her \u201cguess what im making tonight!\u201d If she answers what just say no you have to guess. She will guess the first thing that comes to mind which is likely what she will want to eat. Bam. There you go. Something guaranteed to make her happy and feel like you were proactive without the pressure of what if she doesn\u2019t like it. Use it sparingly though, as again you need to be taking initiative with emotional labor.\n\nChores as well are good to do, make a chore chart of what typically needs done and personalize it (i.e. Laundry day on x day, mopping instead of vacuuming if you don\u2019t have a vacuum, etc.)\n\nIf you aren\u2019t sure about anything like home repairs or whatnot, call around, get quoted, make lists/price comparisons and such, and go for it. My mom needed end of tenancy cleaning in London before moving to the US again, we are Americans who lived in Spain my entire adult life. Did I know anything about it? No. But rather than force my mom to learn when she is dealing with everything else from an international move, I googled what it was, looked at each different company website to see what it included, and called until I found a reputable company of a lovely family rather than a corporate entity. I also looked into lawsuits (which three of the 20 something I looked at had multiple!!), google reviews, customer satisfaction, etc. And had a number for my mom to call by the end of the day with two outstanding contenders. That is what emotional labor is, even if you don\u2019t make the sole or final decision or even if you need your partners or anyone elses input. Do the bulk or anything you can do regarding research before bringing it to them.\n\nMy partner and I right now are also going through a move. He is working, I\u2019m on vacation from University until next month. I don\u2019t know anything about carpentry but we worked on the furniture together and I do the vast majority of cleaning, organizing, planning, etc. And when he gets home from work he does the furniture and electronic stuff. He also prefers to be the one calling and getting quotes as he has a local business and has to play into town politics and be mindful of whose help he receives and if they\u2019ve helped his family before (lol) but we each do our own share without being asked by the other although we discuss things mutually. \n\nI think it\u2019d go a long way if you just started taking initiative by saying things like \u201cI was thinking of this, heres my reasoning with price comparison and why I prefer these two companies the most. What do you think?\u201d rather than \u201coh I haven\u2019t a clue about this wife I think you\u2019ll know best.\u201d Nobody wants an \u201cidk\u201d partner. Be the \u201cwhat do you think\u201d partner. Be proactive and assertive. And most of all be proactive in learning how to be proactive!

Sure. But I have a hard time believing that all of these friends, family members, BIL, and everyone are all unreasonably horrible to you and then you're just the innocent victim in all of it. Hell, even just going with a big plastic garbage bag, collecting the trash, then tossing it is like the least labor intensive version of cleaning and would be a big help. Look up electronic vacuums on amazon to help out and have her buy the best one at an affordable price point. I'm only saying this because it seems like otherwise your relationship was fine and from what you said that she's even the one to usually visit you. If literally every single person who knows you IRL is saying you're the asshole, maybe you simply are.\n\nDid you even ever ask her why she maybe didn't want a cleaner? Perhaps afraid of thievery, embarrassment, keeping up with appearances, not wanting to seem weak, actually having secret money issues, anything? Honestly, it's really easy to attribute malicious intent to things that could have many other explanations. You can sit there and feel right about it all by strangers on the internet and refuse to engage any of your family but in my opinion that's going to lead to a very lonely lifestyle. And unless they have a long-standing history of abuse, that probably isn't what you want in the end.", "created_utc": "1563544713.0", "edited": "False", "id": "eu7wr5b", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_cf4zio", "parent_id": "t3_cf4zio", "score": "61", "subreddit": "AmItheAsshole", "subreddit_id": "t5_2xhvq"}, {"author": "Anodynic", "body": "Think you bring a valid perspective.
