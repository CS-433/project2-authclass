The extra fiber helps with satiety and a healthy gut, and that outer stuff has tons of vitamins and minerals that would be lost otherwise.\n* Try to use whole foods that are naturally sweet (like dates, figs, and raisins) for adding sweetness as opposed to sugar.

I make my own from 1:2 ratio of nuts to water (so 1 cup nuts to 2 cups water) and straining. Cashew milk does not need to be strained, but the others do.\n* Use grocery shopping as a way to explore new vegetables you might never have tried. Pick up dandelion and mustard greens, or rutabaga, or brussel sprouts. Go to an Asian or Indian store and see if they have different veggies than you find in a regular grocery store. Go to a farmers market if there is one and check it out. Treat this as an exploration of the full space of possibilities.\n* Use this transition to also generally clean up your diet.

Attacking civilians is **bad**. I just wish the US wouldn't get a pass when we do similar things.\n\n[Edit] In terms of specific examples, no I don't have them, at least off-hand. But the fact that the Obama Administration reclassified anyone of combat age within <x> feet/meters of a drone strike as a \"terrorist\" (I forget the actual amount, but it was laughably wide), combined with the drone program itself means that there were likely lots of civilians killed as a result.\n\nAdding to that the fact that *no* occupier likes resistance and you're living in a f*cking fairy land if you don't think the US has done this.\n\nAnd to everyone who says this is whataboutism and deflection and serving the Russian agenda, let me say it again: **THIS IS BAD**. **THEY SHOULD NOT GET A PASS FOR THIS**. And no, I'm **not** giving them a pass for this, I'm not pro-Russia (Putin is a fascist and needs to rot in hell). Is that bellicose enough for people here?\n\nI just wish that American atrocities like drone-bombing schools, hospitals, and weddings (I don't have articles handy, but these definitely made news when they happened and should be easy to find) got an appropriate amount of pushback and accountability. I wish that *our* war crimes got as much push-back and sanctions as Russia's do. That was literally my only point. \n\nAny occupying force is going to need to restore order after having destroyed the existing order, and that means taking out opposition (wherever it comes from). That doesn't make it *right*, but it makes it painfully banal. The problem is that the incentives all align to push *any* occupying force to do this (to varying degrees). If you have as tenuous a hold as Russia does, your repression will be harsher. If you have more overwhelming firepower and technology like the US did in Iraq and Afghanistan, then you might be able to tolerate a little more dissent. \n\nFreedom fighters are often terrorists who won in the end and are labeled differently based on perspective (e.g. Mandela was on the US Terror watchlist until 2008 or so).", "created_utc": "1665837430.0", "edited": "1665869884.0", "id": "iser9mp", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_y4mozg", "parent_id": "t3_y4mozg", "score": "-97", "subreddit": "news", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3l"}, {"author": "chiraagnataraj", "body": "I have a custom domain with my name, so I just go \"<company name>@<name>.<TLD>\".

At this point, adding oil to a meal actually *detracts* from it for me \u2014 I don't like the oily feeling and I've become quite sensitive to it.\n\n**But**, I get tons of healthy fat. We use shredded coconut in many meals and I eat soy yogurt (homemade, with just soybeans) at every meal. Twice a week I eat oatcakes with tons of seeds. And fat is never something I've actually *watched* per se, as long as it's coming from whole foods.", "created_utc": "1661770788.0", "edited": "False", "id": "im8p8s4", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_wzzwd1", "parent_id": "t1_im72ga6", "score": "3", "subreddit": "PlantBasedDiet", "subreddit_id": "t5_2ud49"}, {"author": "chiraagnataraj", "body": "Tomato powder is literally dried tomato paste.

I suspect this is because the script is Linux-native and was ported to other platforms later and networking stuff is traditionally root-only on Linux.

So it makes sense they went with `proton.me` instead of `proton.mail` (or something similar).\n\n> You rarely use email for personal use, noone wants to pay for it.\n\nAnecdotally, I definitely still use email for personal use \u2014 transferring smaller files, having nice threaded group conversations (most IM software _still_ sucks for this tbh), etc. Not to mention that most services out there still require an email address to signup (unless you do 'Sign in with Google/Apple/Facebook', which I guess people do...?).\n\nBeing able to give out unique email addresses to every service I use is worth _at least_ $5/month on its own \u2014 the benefits to privacy and spam-reduction are invaluable \u2014 even without anything else. Add in the fact that I get a damn fast VPN and a private-by-default calendar and it personally makes obvious sense for me to pay $8/month for all of this. Especially when some streaming services cost upwards of $10/month(!).\n\nIs it possible for me to get all of this for cheaper? Possibly \u2014 I know Tutanota has some of the same functionality with a lower base tier. But...uh...I now get 520 GB of space at the tier I'm paying for (Proton Ultimate) along with 10 VPN connections. That's hard to replicate with any other privacy-by-default platform without paying through your nose.\n\nTo be honest, earlier Proton bundles felt a bit too expensive for what we were getting, but I still subscribed because I felt it was still good enough for what I was paying. Now, though? It's a _steal_. It's almost too easy to recommend them for more casual users of email and people who care about privacy but aren't techies (and so won't fiddle around with knobs in every bit of software for every bit of incremental privacy). The Ultimate package comes with _so much more_ than I was ever expecting after the revised pricing.\n\nObviously there are still rough edges (e.g. email search is still a bit finicky).

Side note: it may not brown the way it would with regular tofu (I ran into this and the _bottom_ browned up quite a bit, though thankfully it didn't burn).\n* Black bean tofu came out quite well. I didn't try sauteeing it this time (baked it in the oven) and it held its shape (as expected when baking). It also absorbed teriyaki sauce (stolen from [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/PlantBasedDiet/comments/shm0m1/comment/hv3zvzk/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)) as expected. Basically, it seems to function nearly identically to normal tofu, while retaining a lot of fiber and other goodies that would be thrown out when making regular tofu.\n\nOverall, I've had decent success with the recipes /u/GraphCat posted and I'll have to actually try red lentil tofu next (we're low on red lentils, so have to restock before trying).", "created_utc": "1653180524.0", "edited": "1653271338.0", "id": "i9if7lu", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_upy8k2", "parent_id": "t1_i952ny5", "score": "1", "subreddit": "PlantBasedDiet", "subreddit_id": "t5_2ud49"}, {"author": "chiraagnataraj", "body": "For soy beans, yes.

I plug in my SD card into my desktop and copy images into subdirectory of the `$PICTURES/Canon` directory based on the date the photo was taken (extracted from the metadata) \u2014 this step happens **outside of Darktable** (I have a little script that takes care of it). Then, each day automatically becomes a _film roll_ (so it's easy to see the photos from a single day) when I import them into Darktable. Further, I then add tags to each day's photos to allow grouping them logically into e.g. a certain trip's photos or whatever. Since Darktable allows for hierarchical tags, this allows easily filtering to show all photos taken on trips, for example, in addition to filtering to show the photos of a certain trip only.\n\nI basically use tags to maintain virtual albums and folders to maintain on-disk organization.", "created_utc": "1652699253.0", "edited": "False", "id": "i8t0wa6", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_uqnla5", "parent_id": "t3_uqnla5", "score": "2", "subreddit": "DarkTable", "subreddit_id": "t5_2zx69"}, {"author": "chiraagnataraj", "body": "Exactly.

So for me, I can't really call myself fully WFPB (for one thing, when I eat out I restrict to vegan options but don't restrict on salt/oil/sugar) but I **am** fully plant based (I have fully stopped consuming all animal products).\n\nSeparately, I am _also_ vegan in that I ensure there are no animal products in my non-food purchases (e.g. leather, wool, etc).", "created_utc": "1650975662.0", "edited": "False", "id": "i6999id", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_ucazuf", "parent_id": "t3_ucazuf", "score": "41", "subreddit": "PlantBasedDiet", "subreddit_id": "t5_2ud49"}, {"author": "chiraagnataraj", "body": "Well, then, I don't know what to say.

Obviously variety for variety's sake isn't great if it's _mindless_ variety. The point here (and the way I approach this challenge) is to maximize diversity of foods _within each food group_.

The main thing which I had done (which I've gotten better about) was nearly eliminating all grain (except for oats from my oatcakes) from my diet (in my quest to increase the amount of beans and legumes I was getting). Nowadays, I regularly get grains, so that's no longer an issue (and again, it sort of happened by accident).\n\nI will also note here that I also try to get at least two different veggies each meal (and ideally the two from lunch and the two from dinner are different), where one of those is a leafy green and the other is some other veggie (could be a root veggie, for example). In terms of distinct vegetables, however, I think we tend to get a wider variety of leafy greens than root vegetables (something to try to change, I think!), opting for staples like carrots, sweet potatoes, potatoes, and beets (I haven't gotten a daikon radish in a _long_ time \u2014 I should fix that!).\n\nGenerally, though, I don't try to go for variety for variety's sake _per se_. It's more that each grain (for example) has different micronutrient (and even macronutrient) breakdowns and has a different texture, which makes the 'rice' much more interesting flavor-wise and texture-wise (the nutritional boosts don't hurt either!). It was the same reasoning with the nuts (for the nut milk) and seeds (for the oatcakes). In the latter case, I added poppy seeds to them to boost my calcium intake (similar reason I switched to mungo beans from chickpeas).\n\nI guess my overall point here is that it isn't _completely_ mindless ;)", "created_utc": "1650391083.0", "edited": "1650391780.0", "id": "i5deqj1", "is_submitter": "True", "link_id": "t3_u7a2cn", "parent_id": "t1_i5dd9ie", "score": "5", "subreddit": "PlantBasedDiet", "subreddit_id": "t5_2ud49"}, {"author": "chiraagnataraj", "body": "Yeah, growing all of them would be a real challenge!

And, of course, this is on a _weekly_ basis. So for grains and legumes, you can pretty much automatically count them if you eat in any substantial quantity \u2014 I might be overcounting my grains since I get about 0.5 tsp of each grain per meal, but I eat an 8 (or 11, depending on whether you separately count different colors of rice and quinoa) grain mix (so overall about 4 tsp of dry grain in a meal and I have this a few times a week). 1/4 cup is 12 tsp, so I think it's reasonable to include my grain mix in the equation.
