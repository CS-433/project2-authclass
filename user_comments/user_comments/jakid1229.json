So many places, that we use it to express different tenses! I have been, You have done, etc.\n\nWith that preamble out of the way, you are probably familiar with the standard way to express ownership in Russian, which is \u0443 \u043c\u0435\u043d\u044f \u0435\u0441\u0442\u044c. I have _something_. \n\nSo then we get to the English sentence \"This park has everything\". When we break this sentence down, does the park literally own anything? No. This is just the paradigm through which we express this idea in English. We aren't expressing literal ownership, but rather the idea that within the park, there are a lot of things. \n\nSo the difference here is that in English, we far more readily use the verb \"have\" than in Russian. An easy heuristic would be that animate objects can have things, and inanimate objects can't. This heuristic specifically works better when we're talking about places.\n\n1.

I'm really not sure how you lost that game except thru random picks around objectives. Based on the timeline it looks like you guys went to kill irelia in bot lane around 36 minutes and gave up baron for it, which probably had a much stronger impact on losing than the champ itself.

However, it is a game, so if banning her makes you have more fun than more power to you.

The reason is simply what they contribute to the team is different. Irelia is good at skirmishing and bad at team fighting whereas vlad is the opposite.

Note how I use priority and pressure differently in the last comment. The TF can ult bot, so the LeBlanc wouldn't have priority for a bot fight, unless she keeps the TF in vision. That's why LeBlanc will play further up to prevent the TF from being able to ult without at least taking damage.\n\nShe also has pressure b/c it will force the TF to lose resources (gold and XP).\n\nMost of the time when people refer to lane priority, it is in reference to being able to help the Jungler do X (take scuttle, take dragon, invade enemy red buff, etc.). Basically the laner can respond to a fight first. Specifically when it comes to invades.\n\nImagine a scenario where mid lane has priority (pushing enemy into tower) but bot Lane doesn't (they are being pushed in). This means that the Jungler were to invade and find the enemy Jungler, then the friendly midlaner would show up before the enemy midlaner, but the opposing bot Lane could show up sooner as well. This scenario is when a team has \"mid priority but not bot priority.\" Especially the case for bot Lane, it takes even longer for the friendly bot Lane to rotate because of the longer lane + the fact that the enemy bot Lane could be camping a bush instead of actually responding to the invade.\n\nEdit: Also keep in mind that being pushed in also has implicit assumptions about the positioning of the laners. If LeBlanc is pushing in TF it means he is under tower and, in order to respond to a fight, has to take a dangerous route (leaving him open to being solo'd by LeBlanc).

If I'm LeBlanc, pushing in a TF, then that TF couldn't ult bot without being in my face (and having it potentially canceled by chain). In this sense, the TF doesn't have priority.\n\nAnother key element to understanding priority is that if TF were to ult bot (step out of vision for instance) then he'd lose a bunch of minions to tower. This is how priority ties in with pressure. Me as LeBlanc forced the TF to lose 200 gold and some experience in exchange for him having the potential to earn gold by killing bot Lane.\n\nHowever, if a fight were to occur near scuttle (say a 2v2 with mids and Jungler) then the LeBlanc would be able to rotate over first (just by her positioning on the side of the map that her Jungler is on) by going thru the side brush.\n\nThis is one of the reasons that midlaners position on their Jungler's side as well. It doesn't matter if you're pushing in the enemy mid if you are on the opposite side of the map from your Jungler (or wherever the fight may break out).

You understand the meaning here from your other comments.\n\nPressure is not that. Pressure has a wide range of applications but it's meaning is more defined. Pressure is when you force the enemy to do something or they lose out on something else. An example would be if a midlaner is exerting a lot of pressure (in this example let's say TF). If the TF is constantly shoving the lane and then stepping into a side brush, they are exerting pressure b/c if the enemy bot Lane doesn't back up, they can be ulted. The key distinction here is that the TF also has priority b/c he can move first to a fight that happens in the river.\n\nPriority and pressure usually equate to similar results for mid laners, but not for other roles (most notably jungle). Jungle pressure is something entirely divorced from the concept of priority.\n\nHopefully this helps clear up the distinction in the terms.

He can only use Q whenever the bar is empty, half full (exactly half), or full and counting down. If the bar is red, it will deal nearly 2x damage.\n\nThe keys to the lane are:\n\nFirst that you should be using your soldiers to push the lane as much as possible. Vlad has VERY long cool downs early and thus can't keep up with the push of nearly any midlaners until he has a couple points in his E (maxed second).\n\nSecond, if you are below 60 percent health and he has his ignite flash, he can likely kill you. You must keep yourself above a health threshold.\n\nTo that end, don't let him get a single empowered Q on you. Give up CS if you have to. Give up that cannon minion if you have to. If I am able to land an empowered Q on you, you won't be in a good position b/c then I can pressure you out of a lot more CS.\n\nFinally, don't ult him away but rather WEQ away after he ults you.

There are a lot of intricacies to this matchup that aren't as simple as \"always pool his ult\" etc.\n\nBefore I go into the bullet points, LLstylish (#1 Zed NA, challenger zed one trick) posted a very in depth lane matchup guide for this lane (obviously how to play from Zed's side).  He points out all of the things the Vlad does wrong in the guide as well, so it is very helpful to watch.  \nHere is the link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1r8pMpKuXA\n\n1. Starting item is a bit tricky in this lane.  If you are confident that you can beat him, you can start dark seal three pots.  If you are less confident, you can start cloth armor, four pots.  If you know for a fact you will stomp him, you can start boots, four pots.  Back for seeker's armguard first every time.  Even if you get a kill early against him, this item is incredibly powerful in this matchup since it will effectively nullify most of his WEQ combo damage if he doesn't follow up.  Typically, the enemy comp will be full AD or close to it, so tabis will also be a good pick up.  After that, the build is based on what you need, but finishing zhonyas is pretty critical on Vlad into a mostly AD team comp.\n\n2. You can run regular runes and masteries into Zed.  If their team is full AD, I do have a page that replaces the scaling health seals with armor seals.  Always run SRS on mid Vlad.\n\n3. The most important thing when playing into Zed is wave management.  You can get a huge advantage off of NEVER doing any damage to the wave in the first couple of waves.  If he autos the minions even once, the wave will push to you and you can freeze it near your tower.  Next is being able to play around his W.  When Zed W's, his CD is something like 20 or 22 seconds early and is his entire mobility.  You must not let him get any CS while his W is down .  You can zone the FUCK out of Zed without a W.  Be careful to back off once the CD is close to being back up though.  Next, and this is the most important point, you MUST keep yourself above 75% health at all times in the early laning phase.  Anything less, and Zed can kill you at any time early.  He will bring ignite, and his WEQW AA ignite (assuming he hits both Q's) will doing about 65% of your health at least. If you W during this but don't dodge anything, you'll die because of the health cost of W.\n", "created_utc": "1499008169.0", "edited": "False", "id": "djoovth", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_6ks69z", "parent_id": "t3_6ks69z", "score": "4", "subreddit": "VladimirMains", "subreddit_id": "t5_37alf"}, {"author": "jakid1229", "body": "If you pool sometime during the animation before he reappears, it won't apply the damage. \n\nEdit: And he won't get the CD back.

The fact is that is highly depends on the matchup. This is a topic that Bjergsen talked about specifically in a stream about a month ago. \n\nHe was laning against a zed and was criticizing him for using WEQ to poke instead of farm. This is because Bjerg was HARD pushing and so the zed was down some 30 odd CS by 10 mins because he kept trying to poke. \n\nSo to answer your question, it depends. You should be able to tell if you can poke based on a couple of things. \n\nFirst, where is your wave? If you are pushing them under tower for some reason, then using your WEQ to poke puts you in a big risk because you'll be pushed without a reliable way to escape a gank. \n\nSecond, if you use WEQ, how many minions will you miss? If the answer is more than 2 or 3, it probably isn't worth it. One thing you always have to keep in mind when laning as zed is that if you use WEQ, you (mostly) forfeit any immediate kill pressure, so the other laner can play much more aggressive (zoning you out from more CS). \n\nThird, do they have enough sustain to where it doesn't matter? For example, if you lane against vlad and use WEQ but don't hit everything (thus don't get thunderlords), he'll be able to sustain all of that poke before your next WEQ while also hard pushing you. Thus you'll forfeit a lot of lane pressure. This converts into lost pressure for your Jungler as well. \n\nIt's always important to keep these things in mind when laning as zed. Hope that helped.

Obviously keeping track of their CDs and where their jungler is, but more so, what the enemy can do at any given time. \n\nFor your specific example, I would bet 10 to 1 that what happened was that the Nasus did 3 things. First he made a prediction that your jungler was botside (based on any number of factors). Second, you probably had your lane pushed up so he knew you would have a long way to chase. Because of these two things, he knows that the only way you win a 1v1 vs him is if you parry his wither.

In the current meta, winning lane early is super important and being able to punish the hyper carries (twitch, Tristana, Vayne, etc.) is more important than ever. Jhin needs as much AD early as possible for this reason. \n\nSecond, the more meta build is to get essence reaver, into swiftys, into RFC.  From there is situational. The questions to ask yourself are \"do they have a lot of armor?\" then get LDR (or mortal reminder if they have any hyper healers like Vladimir or Dr. Mundo). \"Am I being blown up by an AP threat?\" get hexdrinker. \"Do they have a CC ability that is consistently leading to my death?\" Get QSS (but usually don't upgrade to Mercurial until later). If you answered no to all of these questions, then get IE. \n\nThird, you usually don't need to get a lifesteal item (if you didn't need QSS) on Jhin. Because of the way he should be played in team fights, if you are taking a lot of damage and need life steal, then you are probably (not definitely) playing him wrong. There are certainly cases to buy BT or Mercurial, but it shouldn't be a guaranteed part of your build. \n\nFourth, one of the most important things about getting better with jhin is knowing which items you need to get and WHY. If you are always always always building the same 5 items first, then you are not rarely doing the optimal build for a certain game. \n\nSorry for the long post, hopefully it's helpful.  \n\nEdit: Also for masteries it is almost always better to take bounty hunter in the current meta. It's honestly broken (it's a free fire drag if you get all 5 kills).\n\nEdit 2: the reason essence reaver is more optimal as a first AD item is because the CDR allows for more ults which is one of the best ults in the game for getting picks. Jhin is a utility ADC, not a hyper carry (this is the same reason Ashe goes ER first).
