I've never looked at the Jeopardy one, but it seems interesting. \n\nThe first thing I'd recommend you do while going through the game collections is study tactics. Heisman, the Alburt book, and maybe the Weteschnik book next. There's overlap between them, but it's good to have more things to solve. I haven't seen the Weteschnik book. You don't have to finish all three to move on -- they should all be quick reads and you can do things after the first one in parallel with other work. Then I'd recommend the first few parts of the Silman Endgame Course -- go up to around your current rating. \n\n\nThe next thing I'd do is the Yusupov book exactly as directed unless you've never seen any endgame stuff before or any strategy stuff before. You might also decide instead to do a little strategy first -- if Amateur's Mind clicks with you, go for that, otherwise go for the more traditional presentation with Alburt's Strategy book. Work on tactics throughout, but the Yusupov book has a lot of tactics. Continually read through annotated master games and do tactics.

And unfortunately if you have to manage the handoffs, you now have two jobs: all the stuff you're doing now AND starting to wrangle volunteers, organize new systems, etc, which is itself enough to keep one person overly busy. Now, your task of handing stuff off would be infinitely easier if you could find somebody to handle the latter part. Ideally, the priest of the parish would either start that or find somebody to do it, but it sounds like they're not that kind of manager. Things that help are to have cleaning rotations, where people sign up on a list and if you get enough people they only have to do it three or four times a year and it's only like an hour or two. I recommend telling your priest that you're going to take one or two months off of anything except maybe one or two things that don't require extra work -- like if you enjoy chanting or serving and it doesn't require extra from you to do it, keep doing it. In the meantime, they have to figure out how to cover, and when you're back, you all need a plan to take some of the work off of you. And you can help with this by telling a lot of the people at the parish how they can help out. There's bound to be somebody in there who has a passion for either helping out or organizing people to help out if they only knew the need.

He goes for the immediate b4! in your position. Probably not the best move, but it's fun. Here's the game, he's blowing a lower rated player off the board in an instructive fashion, albeit a little one-sided, but that's helpful because it shows you clearly how the plan goes when it goes well: https://lichess.org/ysMFC2Np#0", "created_utc": "1663119360.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ioc6us8", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_xdnm2u", "parent_id": "t3_xdnm2u", "score": "2", "subreddit": "chess", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhr7"}, {"author": "giziti", "body": "put the board in a hot car for a while and it'll flatten out.", "created_utc": "1663118775.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ioc5jep", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_xdlryt", "parent_id": "t1_iobuk63", "score": "3", "subreddit": "chess", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhr7"}, {"author": "giziti", "body": "No recourse after the game is over, results reported, etc. It's AFLO: another 'fun' learning opportunity.", "created_utc": "1663111601.0", "edited": "False", "id": "iobpfdk", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_xdjl7u", "parent_id": "t3_xdjl7u", "score": "5", "subreddit": "chess", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhr7"}, {"author": "giziti", "body": "In person?

There's lots of Class C skill level/Class B skill-level players in the U1200 category in the USCF, who got good online, but just haven't played enough tournament games. Additionally, all the tournament newcomers get funneled into the lower-level sections, and many of them don't stick with tournament play enough to get to their actual level, meaning the U1400 section of the USCF becomes a giant mess of inflated and deflated ratings. \n\nI want to hop on again with another comment about this. Another thing is that players below around 1400 are just, in general, higher variance players. It's anybody's game. However, a 1500 is just going to stomp everybody below 1100 - and by stomp I don't mean something vague, I mean going 5/5 or at least 4.5/5 consistently with a rare loss. And they'll be pretty consistent about it. So if somebody's really 1500 OTB strength, which is different from any online rating, they will ascend in rating *rapidly* because of how USCF bonus points work. \n\nLike, if somebody's rated 600 and plays a 600, 700, 810, 1000, and 1100 and goes 5/5, the USCF ratings estimator puts their post-event rating as 992.
