So let\u2019s say you started flying in August. You won\u2019t be paid for any of your August work until September, right? Well, airlines won\u2019t make you fly all of August without a single paycheck, so what they often do is they give you a small advance on future earnings so that you get at least something during your August flying. Then they\u2019ll reduce a little bit from several of your future paychecks to compensate that advance and this sometimes takes a few months to balance out.\n\nSecond, remember that your paycheck will be paid in two installments, but paychecks take several days to be processed. So it\u2019s possible that by the time you are actually paid, your paycheck might not be an accurate representation of the hours you actually flew if you increased or decreased your hours too close to payday. For this reason, they often give you an advance of roughly half what they estimate you\u2019ll earn for the month on your first paycheck the following month, then by the time your second paycheck comes there has been enough time to accurately see the exact amount the company owes you and they give you the difference of your total month wages, minus the advance they already paid you. \n\nIt\u2019s a bit confusing at first, but suffice it to say after about 3 months you should have a better idea of what your regular earnings will look like.", "created_utc": "1663205200.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ioh2ypj", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_xdp1y4", "parent_id": "t1_iodsel8", "score": "3", "subreddit": "flightattendants", "subreddit_id": "t5_2vb78"}, {"author": "flyingtowardsFIRE", "body": "Are you brand new and is this your first paycheck?

The company needs to have some degree of dependability from their employees in order to keep the whole operation functioning. In turn, it is in the best interest of the employees to help their company succeed so that they remain employed. So, the company needs dependable workers, and the workers *want* to be dependable, but they also need some understanding and flexibility from the company for things like sickness. But who determines what a fair sick leave policy is?\n\nWell, historically, companies will want a strict policy, while employees will prefer a more lenient one (so as not to be easily fired, as you mentioned). Here comes the solution: collective bargaining! The employees communicate their issues to an entity to negotiate on their behalf (after all, what flight attendant has time to negotiate a contract? Contribute a little from your paycheck and hire a powerful and dedicated team for that!). Together, the union and employees work with the company to find a middle ground of what is fair. Will there be compromise? Sure. But it will always be *more* fair than if the company could do whatever they wanted. And to get back to your original question, an abuse of this agreed upon amount of time off due to sickness would then be a fireable offense.

As you said, frequent travel on off days can really drain your savings, so I prefer to keep it to a minimum, but do try to pick up work trips to interesting places.\n\nI actually love this job for so many more reasons, not just the flight benefits. It isn\u2019t just a job, it is a fantastic career that provides many things, including a great quality of life. Below are some of the points I\u2019ve shared on previous posts in this sub. I hope they inspire some of you to see how this can truly be a career for life. For reference, I was a teacher prior to this job. \n\n>\u2026I don\u2019t want a career that gives my life meaning, I want a career that affords me a *life* that has meaning. Here is how being a flight attendant does that for me:\n\n>\u2022\t\u2060My improved mental health. When I step off that plane at the end of a trip, my work is done. I don\u2019t have to bring any work home, I don\u2019t need to prepare anything for my next day of work. Other than just showing up on time, no one is relying on me for anything. This is what cured that \u201cSunday night feeling\u201d of crippling anxiety I was experiencing every week in my previous career, and suddenly I began waking up every single day stress-free. This alone is priceless.\n\n>\u2022\t\u2060Benefits. This is what will separate a good job from a great career. I\u2019m given full medical, vision, dental, long term disability, and life insurance. I have a company provided 401k with a generous company match. I get a crew discount on my cell phone plan, gym membership, hotels, rental cars, popular clothing and electronics stores, and free admission to museums and popular attractions in many major cities across the world. But what\u2019s even better is....\n\n>\u2022\t\u2060The flight benefits. I fly all over the world for free. All I need to pay is the taxes if I go internationally. That often means I can fly internationally in business class (a ticket that normally costs $10,000) for approximately $120. My family flies for free too. For my parents who had to budget and often go without in order to raise me and my siblings, being able to gift them with free travel has been a blessing. They no longer stress about planning trips because their flight plans can be flexible and booked last minute. They\u2019ve never had to miss a family gathering or wedding since I got this job.\n\n>\u2022\t\u2060The pay. It\u2019s not uncommon for mainline FAs to make 6 figures after 5-10 years of seniority based wage increases. I never would have made that while teaching. Even when I first started I was impressed with the pay. No, it wasn\u2019t great, but I also didn\u2019t have to work very often while being on reserve. $35k/year is great if you only work 10 days per month on average. When I wanted to find part-time work, I had no trouble finding jobs that were willing to work around my flying schedule, and it is work I could enjoy for what it was because I have full time income and health benefits already.\n\n>\u2022\t\u2060Flexibility. First, there are a lot of opportunities at my airline to get time off. I can move my trips around, take leaves without pay, schedule large chunks of time off. Since getting this job, I have never missed a single event that I wanted to attend. Most airlines also have generous amounts of time off for maternity leave as well. Secondly, I have total flexibility on where I want to live. If my SO needs to move for work, I can go with them without any trouble. I can live abroad. I can live in a new place every year if I want to.\n\n>\u2022\t\u2060And just as an anecdote, if you have a degree, you\u2019ll be in good company on the jumpseat.

Here\u2019s some ideas I posted when it was asked before:\n\nPower bank. With my airline it was standard issue, but small. I was gifted a larger one and it\u2019s still my most used possession for work and leisure trips.\n\nA subscription to the duolingo (language learning) app. The free version is great, but if you pay for it, you have the ability to download all the courses and do them offline. This was crucial for feeling productive during commuting flights or deadheads.\n\nThe Starbucks app. Hey, it\u2019s flight attendant fuel, and it\u2019s just so nice to pay for your coffee with your phone rather than having to dig out your wallet from the bag you packed perfectly. Plus, you\u2019ll buy enough to get frequent freebies. Also, I\u2019m embarrassed to admit this, but I downloaded the McDonald\u2019s app too because you can order ahead for pickup, even at airport locations. On more than one occasion I\u2019ve been able to order food while pax deplane, then pick it up on my way to my next flight when there was a right connection. \n\nWater bottle. Bring it on every trip and fill it up at the airport or on the plane before the layover. I\u2019ve stayed in some hotels abroad (and even domestically) and felt like I couldn\u2019t drink the water safely. Plus, it\u2019s nice to have handy just when you\u2019re waiting at the gate or sitting reserve. Flying will dehydrate you.\n\nIf you like gadgets, they make these cool water bottle humidifiers if you\u2019re into that sort of thing. Apparently they\u2019re a standard size so the hotel room water bottles will fit on it. It can be tough to sleep in hotel rooms all the time as they basically never clean the vents so it can get stuffy.\n\nFor the lunchbox, the hot logic is good, but I don\u2019t honestly use mine. I really want to be the type who brings food from home, but the truth is it\u2019s basically a full time job keeping your food on ice and for multi day trips your food either spoils or you run out. Also, part of the fun on layovers is getting food while you\u2019re in a new city or with your crew. I still pack a lunchbox, but it\u2019s all healthy snacks. Then on the layover I indulge. Stasher bags are my new obsession though.

Here is how being a flight attendant does that for me:\n\n- My improved mental health. When I step off that plane at the end of a trip, my work is done. I don\u2019t have to bring any work home, I don\u2019t need to prepare anything for my next day of work. Other than just showing up on time, no one is relying on me for anything. This is what cured that \u201cSunday night feeling\u201d of crippling anxiety I was experiencing every week, and suddenly I began waking up every single day stress-free. This alone is priceless.\n\n- Benefits. This is what will separate a good job from a great career. I\u2019m given full medical, vision, dental, long term disability, and life insurance. I have a company provided 401k with a generous company match. I get a crew discount on my cell phone plan, gym membership, hotels, rental cars, popular clothing and electronics stores, and free admission to museums and popular attractions in many major cities across the *world*. But what\u2019s even better is....\n\n- The flight benefits. I fly all over the world for free. All I need to pay is the taxes if I go internationally. That often means I can fly internationally in business class (a ticket that normally costs $10,000) for approximately $120. My family flies for free too. For my parents who had to budget and often go without in order to raise me and my siblings, being able to gift them with free travel has been a blessing. They no longer stress about planning trips because their flight plans can be flexible and booked last minute. They\u2019ve never had to miss a family gathering or wedding since I got this job.\n\n- The pay. It\u2019s not uncommon for mainline FAs to make 6 figures after 5-10 years of seniority based wage increases. I never would have made that while teaching. Even when I first started I was impressed with the pay. No, it wasn\u2019t great, but I also didn\u2019t have to work very often while being on reserve. $30k/year is great if you only work 10 days per month on average. I\u2019ve had no trouble finding part time work that is willing to work around my flying schedule, and it is work I can enjoy for what it is because I have full time income and health benefits already. \n\n- Flexibility. First, there are a lot of opportunities at my airline to get time off. I can move my trips around, take leaves without pay, schedule large chunks of time off. Since getting this job, I have never missed a single event that I wanted to attend. Most airlines also have generous amounts of time off for maternity leave as well. \nSecondly, I have total flexibility on where I want to live. If my SO needs to move for work, I can go with them without any trouble. I can live abroad. I can live in a new place every year if I want to.\n\n- And just as an anecdote, if you have a degree, you\u2019ll be in good company on the jumpseat. I have sat next to a lot of professionals including engineers, nurses, teachers, ballerinas, accountants, coders, people who ran their own businesses, and people who were managing directors or presidents at their previous companies. Everyone took a pay cut to take this job, and none of them regret it. You simply cannot put a price tag on having a flexible schedule, lots of free time, and strong mental health.", "created_utc": "1630935319.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hbt1z7h", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_pipnbi", "parent_id": "t3_pipnbi", "score": "37", "subreddit": "flightattendants", "subreddit_id": "t5_2vb78"}, {"author": "flyingtowardsFIRE", "body": "I think u/broccolie is making something similar.", "created_utc": "1630783398.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hbloy97", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_phw7ra", "parent_id": "t3_phw7ra", "score": "1", "subreddit": "smallbusiness", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qr34"}, {"author": "flyingtowardsFIRE", "body": "This is very helpful, thank you.

I taught for two years before I began desperately searching for a new career. Sure, I found the work very meaningful, and in some ways the difference I was making in children\u2019s lives helped me feel fulfilled. But the truth is, I don\u2019t want a career that gives my life meaning, I want a career that affords me a LIFE that has meaning. Here is how being a flight attendant does that for me:\n\n- My improved mental health. When I step off that plane at the end of a trip, my work is done. I don\u2019t have to bring any work home, I don\u2019t need to prepare anything for my next day of work. Other than just showing up on time, no one is relying on me for anything. This is what cured that \u201cSunday night feeling\u201d of crippling anxiety I was experiencing every week as a teacher, and suddenly I began waking up every single day stress-free. This alone is priceless.\n\n- Benefits. This is what will separate a good job from a great career. I\u2019m given full medical, vision, dental, long term disability, and life insurance. I have a company provided 401k with a generous company match. I get a crew discount on my cell phone plan, gym membership, hotels, rental cars, popular clothing and electronics stores, and free admission to museums and popular attractions in many major cities across the *world*. But what\u2019s even better is....\n\n- The flight benefits. I fly all over the world for free. All I need to pay is the taxes if I go internationally. That often means I can fly internationally in business class (a ticket that normally costs $10,000) for approximately $120. My family flies for free too. For my parents who had to budget and often go without in order to raise me and my siblings, being able to gift them with free travel has been a blessing. They no longer stress about planning trips because their flight plans can be flexible and booked last minute. They\u2019ve never had to miss a family gathering or wedding since I got this job.\n\n- The pay. It\u2019s not uncommon for FAs to make 6 figures after 5-10 years of seniority based wage increases. I never would have made that while teaching. Even when I first started I was impressed with the pay. No, it wasn\u2019t great, but I also didn\u2019t have to work very often while being on reserve. $35k/year is great if you only work 10 days per month on average. I\u2019ve had no trouble finding part time work that is willing to work around my flying schedule, and it is work I can enjoy for what it is because I have full time income and health benefits already. \n\n- Flexibility. First, there are a lot of opportunities at my airline to get time off. I can move my trips around, take leaves without pay, schedule large chunks of time off. Since getting this job, I have never missed a single event that I wanted to attend. Most airlines also have generous amounts of time off for maternity leave as well. \nSecondly, I have total flexibility on where I want to live. If my SO needs to move for work, I can go with them without any trouble. I can live abroad. I can live in a new place every year if I want to.\n\n- And just as an anecdote, if you have a degree, you\u2019ll be in good company on the jumpseat. I have sat next to a lot of professionals including engineers, nurses, teachers, ballerinas, accountants, coders, people who ran their own businesses, and people who were managing directors at their previous companies. Everyone took a pay cut to take this job, and none of them regret it. You simply cannot put a price tag on having a flexible schedule, lots of free time, and strong mental health.\n\nEditing to actually address your questions:\n\n1.) One con is that the hours can be very long and if you\u2019re working a lot, it can get physically exhausting. Also, flights like red eyes, international, and even just transcons can really mess with your sleep schedule and therefor your health. If there are delays, then you may get home later than you expected by a few hours or maybe even a day.\n\n2.) I regret allowing almost two years to pass between my first interview to be an fa, and my second when I finally got the job. Had I known it would change my life and instantly make me the happiest I\u2019ve ever been, I would have spent every waking hour trying to get this job.\n\n3.) I think it would be worth sitting down with the people in your life whose opinions you value, and mentioning some of the points I make above. Not many people are aware of just how good of a career it is. All they see is an unskilled workforce, and too much time spent in hotels. They might not see the many benefits there are that can improve your quality of life.", "created_utc": "1623255399.0", "edited": "1647967961.0", "id": "h163cx3", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_nvxb8m", "parent_id": "t3_nvxb8m", "score": "15", "subreddit": "cabincrewcareers", "subreddit_id": "t5_23oax0"}, {"author": "flyingtowardsFIRE", "body": "Anything factory sealed (chocolates, candies, etc.).
