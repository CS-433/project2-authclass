Excluding the last ~120 years, Bengali society have been very non-sectarian blurring caste/religious divide. \n\nI recommend the book, *The Rise of Islam in The Bengal Frontier*", "created_utc": "1667929312.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ivkmubv", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_yk4w77", "parent_id": "t1_iv0n85h", "score": "1", "subreddit": "bangladesh", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qixf"}, {"author": "bigphallusdino", "body": "Completely understandable", "created_utc": "1667927999.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ivkjeeg", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_ypk3nl", "parent_id": "t1_ivkeoqa", "score": "1", "subreddit": "bengalilanguage", "subreddit_id": "t5_2yvf0"}, {"author": "bigphallusdino", "body": "Ei sub er aro bhalo moderation dorkar", "created_utc": "1667918601.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ivjvp3b", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_ypk3nl", "parent_id": "t3_ypk3nl", "score": "2", "subreddit": "bengalilanguage", "subreddit_id": "t5_2yvf0"}, {"author": "bigphallusdino", "body": "Animals SoS", "created_utc": "1667898251.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ivj011d", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_yosuh3", "parent_id": "t1_ivhmr4r", "score": "1", "subreddit": "skyrimmods", "subreddit_id": "t5_2sqqh"}, {"author": "bigphallusdino", "body": "Ah, that clown?

Mollah's have been ruining the minds of young and old people alike. Nowadays even the simple celebration of my own culture is deemed 'unislamic', which kind of breaks my heart. To make my broader point, first I have to give a little bit of history.\n\nMuslims in Bengal have a long history. The first substantial population of Muslims in Bengal propped up during the Pala Empire, which enjoyed healthy trade relations with the Abbasid Caliphate which also increased the preaching of Islam through trade.\n\nThere were a substantial number of Sufi missionaries spreading Islam in the region, like Shah Sultan Rumi or Syed Shah Shurkul Antia who spread Sufism in the region to a significant extent back in the 11th century, which was a century or prior to the first Muslim conquest of Bengal - namely the Delhi Sultanate.\n\nDuring withering days of the Sena Dynasty, the Delhi Sultanate invaded Bengal and annexed various parts of it, which increased the influx of Sufi missionaries. Eventually, Bengal gained independence from the Delhi Sultanate, forming the Bengal Sultanate. The Bengal Sultanate was largely known for it's religious pluralism, the courts were diverse, the Bengali language was officially recognized in court, which also propelled Bengali literature.\n\nThe Bengali Sultan's originated from central-Asia and Persia, but they were quickly amalgamated in Bengali culture, marrying Bengali women and soon enough being Bengali's themselves, not to mentioning Sultan Jalaluddin Mohammed Shah, converted from Hinduism himself. The situation largely remained the same throughout Shahi Bangala, Baro Bhuiyans and the Mughals.\n\nWhat is Sufism exactly though? Essentially - Islamic Mysticism, Sufi's believed in the idea of spirituality, equality and communicating with god through mystical union. Sufism overlaps somewhat with the philosophy of the large Buddhist-Bengali population and it was certainly a very attractive option for low caste Bengali Hindus. Sufi's also founded Madrasas, which used to be a place of knowledge and an alternative form of curriculum in the British empire. Now it\u2019s a breeding ground for terrorists.\n\nSufi's spread Islam often through music, allowing them to express their love for god. Because of the nature of Sufism it amalgamated quite well with Bengali culture and pre-existing folk religions. Many Sufi saints are regarded as folk deities. Sufis practiced celestial love and Bauls are essentially a mix between Sufism and Vaishnavism. Bauls have had a significant effect on Bengali culture.\n\n>There are as many paths to God as there are souls on Earth\n\n-Rumi\n\nSufism didn\u2019t replace Bengali culture, rather it let itself be adapted to Bengali culture with acceptance and openness. Sufis never imposed Burqa\u2019s or Hijab, Bengali women have always worn saris as their main and preferred attire be it Hindus or Muslims. Religious syncretism used to be widespread in the region.\n\n>God doesn't look at your form but he looks at your heart\n\n>I've never seen the true color of religion.\n\n>Some wear beads as necklace (Hindu rosaries),\n\n>others count beads as Tasbih (Muslim rosaries),\n\n>and so people say they belong to a different religion.\n\n-Lalon Fakir\n\nI have talked about Islamic scholars in Bengal of the past, but what about the ones now? Take a look for yourself, they say music is haram, they say wearing Sari is haram, anything in relation to the celebration of my own culture is haram. They force and insist women on wearing Burqas because anything else is haram, completely forgetting the fact that Burqas are only ideally suited for the desert environment, where there is almost no moisture in air. I will refer back to my point about Bengali women wearing saris instead of Burqas. When Ayoub Bacchu died one of my acquaintances told me during a discussion that he will burn in hell. Why? Solely because he practiced music. Imagine telling that to the Sufi Saints who spread Islam in Bengal in the first place, they will die of heart failure. According to them, anything in relation to Bengali culture is \u2018unislamic\u2019. Funnily enough this is one thing that Hindu extremists and Muslim extremists agree on, the false notion that \u2018Muslims cannot be Bengali\u2019. Ridiculous. Bengali culture does have it\u2019s roots on Dharmic religions, so what? It has Islamic influnce as well. Not to mention, Islam itself has it\u2019s roots on zorastrainism, does that make Islam itself unislamic? There are even some religious zealots who try to say that Bangla is a \u2018haram\u2019 language whilst they praise Urdu, when Urdu itself is a derivative from Sanskrit.\n\nThere is a reason why many Islamists today denounce Sufism, why? Because it is more progressive than them. It is the same reason why Raja Ram Mohan Ray is vilified by Hindu extremists.\n\nWhy is it like this now? Throughout most of their history, Bengali Muslims and Hindus alike have more or less practiced religious pluralism. Muslim-Hindu violence only took a sharp uptick by the end of the British empire(I\u2019m not going to pretend violence didn\u2019t exist prior to that, it certainly did but not at this level). Bengali's were one of the most vocal races against British imperialism, so naturally the British tried to perpetuate the Hindu-Muslim divide, they also famously described Bengali's as a \u2018non-martial race\u2019, even though it is clearly not the case. Bengali culture is losing it\u2019s religious syncretism it had for centuries, and that loss is mainly attributed to Wahhabi-Salamis. The \u2018Islamic vocabulary\u2019 that Islam brought in the Indian subcontinent was that of Farsi, not Arabic, but with the rise of Wahhabism, that too is replaced with Arabic. Wahhabism saw a sharp increase in recent decades, no doubt because of Saudi sponsored Qoumi Madrasas that propelled it\u2019s spread. This spread can also be attributed to many of the \u2018regimes\u2019 that have been in charge of Bangladesh post \u201871, and yes I\u2019m including the current regime too. The current regime had numerous chances to nullify the spread, but they didn\u2019t, because appeasing to right-winged extremism is a tried and tested method to get support.\n\nAlso before anyone starts blabbering about the effects of western culture, I'm well aware of it. But it nowhere near plays a similar role and the main difference is that western culture is not against desi culture, whereas wahhabism is.\n\nIt is honestly disappointing. People should be able to celebrate their own culture without religious boundaries. In my eyes people like Kazi Nazrul Islam, Lalon Fakir, Begum Rokeya are real Bengali Muslims, not whatever mullahs on YouTube people watch nowadays.", "created_utc": "1666647770.0", "edited": "False", "id": "itn6tdx", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_yc1in1", "parent_id": "t3_yc1in1", "score": "16", "subreddit": "bangladesh", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qixf"}, {"author": "bigphallusdino", "body": "Thank you for the correction, I will post it there.", "created_utc": "1666647474.0", "edited": "False", "id": "itn63n1", "is_submitter": "True", "link_id": "t3_ychkrr", "parent_id": "t1_itn5h3v", "score": "1", "subreddit": "bangladesh", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qixf"}, {"author": "bigphallusdino", "body": "Ahhhh..apologies then.

Anyway here goes.\n\nI think in a sense, Barca have been very unlucky this season, starting from being drawn in the UCL group of death, total of 4 clear cut penalties not given among both league and UCL, and injuries.\n\nThe Barca vs Bayern match was probably the most entertaining, Barca had their full squad, and both sides were pretty even, but the difference was that they knew how to finish their chances.\n\nThen came the international break, 3 of Barca's defenders were injured in Kounde, Araujo and Christensen. I believe, had they not have been injured Barca would have beat Inter on both legs and at least be able to put a fight against Bayern, you could make an arguement however that Inter also had Lukaku and Brozovich injured, but with all due respect it's not comparable to the injuries Barcelona had suffered since Lukaku was under performing anyway. In terms of Barca, their back 4 went from Alonso - Garcia/Christensen-Araujo-Kounde to Alonso-Garcia-Pique -Roberto. Suffice to say it's a sizable downgrade. I know people tend to give Garcia a lot of shit, but he is actually very good when paired with a competent defender, and sadly Pique is not that anymore.\n\nThe refeering decisions were the most significant, ignoring the penalty against Bayern, if we had drawn against Inter the first match instead of losing, it would be a LOT different now.\n\nNow comes the criticism I have for the team and Xavi;\n\nI'm usually one of the first to defend Xavi, but it's clear that Xavi does not have a secondary plan, he puts out the same lineup every important match. And as much as I love Busquets, he shouldn't play every single match. And please for the love of god stop pairing Dembele and Raphinha on the wings every single match, it's clear that both are only good on the right, so please put Fati or Ferran on the left. Balde is our best left back by a country mile and it pains me that he didn't start on any of our important match. It is also clear that conceding the first goal makes the entire team lose confidence, Xavi should experiment more with his lineup. One thing I'll give Xavi is that he sort of knows when things go wrong, he tends to make changes/substitutions during the match that change the flow and tempo of the game to our favour but unfortunately they tend to happen late and why oh why he doesn't translate those changes to the next game I will never know.\n\nAnyway that's my two cents, if you disagree with me that's fine, but please let me know your thoughts.", "created_utc": "1666000476.0", "edited": "False", "id": "isnmg99", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_y5f3go", "parent_id": "t3_y5f3go", "score": "3", "subreddit": "soccer", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qi58"}, {"author": "bigphallusdino", "body": "This thread is centered around something negative about Barca, that's why. r/soccer is like that, if it was a pro-barca thread this person would don the famous -200", "created_utc": "1665955380.0", "edited": "False", "id": "islfn40", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_y5m3u5", "parent_id": "t1_isl4wc7", "score": "-2", "subreddit": "soccer", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qi58"}, {"author": "bigphallusdino", "body": ">There are actual linux phones with like Plasma Mobile, Sailfish and Ubuntu touch but they seem kinda too early in development and not advancing very fast...\n\nWho you calling fast?

I am talking about a proper civilization, not some random tribes. That may answer why Bengali =/= Hindu in most places.\n\n\nYou cannot simply attribute an entire culture to a religion. A culture grows and evolve through various effects from various different sources. And a culture is far more than just religion.\n\n\nThe earliest hint of civilization in Bengal came through the Vedic era, when the nation was divided in various kingly realms. The first major Kingdom in Bengal was ruled by the Nanda dynasty, which predominantly was Buddhist, followed by Maurya Empire.\n\n\nThe first major Empire that was formed in Bengal was the Pala Empire, it was also the last major Buddhist dynasty of Bengal, Bengal had been historically a large center of Buddhism in along with minority religions such as Hinduism and Jainism.\n\n\nThen came along the Sena Empire, who were a Hindu Dynasty and were said to hail from southern India, this was the era when Buddhism in Bengal underwent a slow decline as the process of de-Buddhification began, this was primarily done by re-framing Buddhist figures as Hindu avatars and the reintegration of Buddhist subjects as low-caste members of community. I will refer back to the Sena Empire later on in this argument. [Source](https://web.archive.org/web/20180709153810/http://www.caravanmagazine.in/reviews-and-essays/dn-jha-destruction-buddhist-sites). Major growth to the Bengali literature happened in this period too.\n\n\nBefore Islam came to the region, the region had a mixture of Buddhism and Hinduism and a little bit of Jainism, with Buddhism being the majority, so no you cannot attribute the entire Bengali culture to Hinduism - it is the same with any culture. And before you say \"Hinduism and Buddhism are one and the same\" - they are not, yes Buddhism has it's initial roots with Hinduism, but so does the Abrahamic religions with Zoroastrianism, no sane person would say that Islam and Zoroastrianism are the same religion.\n\n\n>Bengalis converted through Sword, particularly under the invasions by Delhi Sultanate. It may indeed have spread to some condiderable extent by peace (Sufis), but that wasn't a majority, and followed AFTER the sword.\n\n\nBengal was one of the most important regions of the Silk Road, and it is alluded that Muslim traders visited the region traversing the silk road, in fact, a mosque under excavation in Bangladesh is dated back to the lifetime of Mohammad.  [Source](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2012/8/18/ancient-mosque-unearthed-in-bangladesh)\n\n\nIslam first began to get prominence in  Bengal during the Pala rule. The Pala Dynasty shared very healthy relations with the Arab Caliphate, which led to increase in the amount of Muslim traders in the region, in fact according the geographer Al-Masudi, he noticed a community of Muslim inhabitants by the 11th century, long before Muslim conquests in Bengal. [Source](https://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Arabs,_The)\n\n\nWhen parts of Bengal were annexed by the Delhi Sultanate, it propelled the spread of Islam further because of the arrival of huge amount of Islamic missionaries. The Bengal Sultanate eventually gained independence from the Delhi Sultanate. The Bengal Sultanate, along with the Pala, Sena Empire and a few others saw huge development in Bengal and Bengali literature.\n\n\nThe Bengal Sultanate was the first instance when Bangla, the language of the Bengali people; was first instituted as an official language used in court, prior to this Bengali Muslim elite preferred Farsi whereas Bengali Hindu elite preferred Sanskrit with both group looking down on Bangla as an \u2018inferior\u2019 language. It is important to remember that Shahi Bangala was known for it\u2019s religious pluralism and tolerance. It was also the period of time when \u2018Taka(currency of Bangladesh and what Rupee is called in WB)\u2019 was first minted on various mint cities throughout Bengal. Source - [Bangladesh: Politics, Economy and Civil Society, book by David Lewis](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00220388.2014.893678?journalCode=fjds20). This era also saw development to Bengali literature.\n\n\nTo further explain the spread of Islam during the Bengal Subah we heve to track back to the Sena Empire, I mentioned the \u2018de- Buddhification\u2019 of Bengal perpetuated by the Brahmin Sena empire. One of the primary beliefs of Buddhism is equality which directly opposed the Hindu caste system, large Buddhist minorities in Bengal were subjugated by the Sena Empire, therefore when the Sena themselves were conquered by the Bengal Sultanate, the influx of Sufi Missionaries succeeded in spreading Islam by droves. [Source](https://www.lib.cam.ac.uk/news/1000-year-old-manuscript-and-stories-it-tells)\n\n\nNow comes the Mughal Period, the spread of Islam accelerated because of various agrarian reforms. This was also the time when the Bengali Calendar was formed, and yes the Bengali calendar did in fact originate from the Hindu calendar, but that is not the point I'm trying to make here.\n\n\nMy entire point is that religion does not necessarily equate to ethnicity. In my eyes, Tagore is as much as a Bengali as Nazrul\n\n\nAnd honestly, the claim is quite offensive. Hundreds of thousands of Bengali people died to liberate my land from Pakistani oppressors. Our people had to shed blood to be able to simply speak their mother tongue, imagine telling them \"they are not real Bengalis\". It's simply disgusting.\n\n\nEDIT: Clarity", "created_utc": "1665160321.0", "edited": "1665249160.0", "id": "irf5e65", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_xxlhq2", "parent_id": "t1_ireinr6", "score": "2", "subreddit": "MapPorn", "subreddit_id": "t5_2si92"}, {"author": "bigphallusdino", "body": "Islam in Bengal has been historically a very brand of Islam compared to other regions, that is because most Bengalis converted to Islam through trade, rather than say by the sword.\n\nAlso, Durga Puja is not inherently a Bengali festival, it's mainly a Hindu festival that is celebrated by Bengali Hindus.

Banjonborno's are your normal letters but the sorbornos can exist as whole letters or as signs - think 'accents' that make vowel sounds.\n\nLet me give you an example;  \u0986 makes the 'aa' sound, the 'accent' for \u0986 is ' \u09be', and when this is attached to '\u0995' which makes the 'k' sound it becomes '\u0995\u09be' which is pronounced as 'ka'. When no vowel signs are used the consonants are pronounced as 'o', think the 'bo' part of 'boycott'. \n\nAlso another thing that you should keep in mind is that there are stuff called compound letters, think compound words in German, but letters instead of words. \n\nI think if you have worked with any other south-asian script before, you can apply most concepts for Bangla too.\n\nI have to say, what you are doing is incredible!

However my arguement still stands though.\n\n>I don't think the gaming community would accept these free fire gamers no matter what they identify as. \n\nBut that is exactly what I'm talking about. The hypocrisy. And this is not new either, its happening with Fortnite and happenened with Minecraft. The circlejerk around Fortnite is downright cringy, people hate the game simply for the sake of hating it, and most of their hatred has no merit other than the fact that this game is dominated by kids, like c'mon guys I don't like Fortnite either but it's because I don't like BR games in general, the amount of hate it gets is completely unwarranted. \n\nIt happened with Minecraft too, but guess what? Minecraft now has a sweetheart status in the gaming community. Who? The kids who played it(including me) have all grown up, and those who passionately hated the game have suddenly switched to liking it, I experienced the change first hand. Try going back to 2014 and say you play MC and see the amount of salt generated. Simply put hating Fortnite is now meta just like hating Minecraft was 7-8 years ago. I know that the comparison between Minecraft and Free-Fire isn't exactly the same, I only drew the comparison to point out the hypocrisy. \n\nEnd of rant, and as I see that you're not interested in having this debate, I'll not post anything unless of course, you change your mind.\n\n>You know what?

That's my own opinion and I believe the opinion of the gaming community as well though I may be wrong. \n\nYou are entitled to your opinion. But I would like to point out that the Switch, Gameboy, DS are all technically 'mobile' handheld, and the games from those earlier handhelds can be easily emulated on smartphones. \n\nRegardless, I kind of do get the point you are trying to make more than I did before, I wouldn't necessarily call people who play Candy Crush 'gamers' because Candy Crush is barely even a game. I personally don't consider people who play only play 1 game, a \"gamer\", but then again who am I to judge maybe I'm wrong.

It meets all the criteria - P2W, Microtransaction-filled cashgrab etc etc. Yet these people who play FIFA seem more \"gamer\". You see where I'm coming from? A better example would be LoL.

Lets use me as an example. I like playing games a lot, mostly single-player, sometimes multiplayer with my friends. \n\n**Problems with multiplayer**\n\n* Games with anti-cheat have the jury out on them whether they work or not. Battleye/EAC technically supports Linux, but some game devs still don't enable the support on their game. See Destiny. \n\n* Good news is that more and more games are gettting EAC/Battleye enabled as each day passes, the most notable ones in recent times are possibly Apex Legends and Fall guys. \n\n*  However there are some games that will likely never get Anti-Cheat support. I'm talking about ones that use kernel-level ring 0 anti-cheat like Valorant(bummer because i actually like this game) and Vanguard.\n\n**Problems with Singleplayer**\n\n* Single player games should mostly be a harmless experience. You may have to put in a custom command to have the game function properly, but other than that it should be seamless experience. \n* Modding is the biggest issue with me personally. I'm someone who likes to use mods a lot. Now if the game in question requires it's mods to be simply dropped in on a folder to function - it should work just fine(Sims4, Civ6) however...\n* If the game requires a mod manager? Well, this is the part that's the most problematic. I personally mod the shit out of 2 games mainly, Skyrim and FIFA. \n* Skyrim modding works surprisingly good on Linux, my only caveat being that performance is noticeably worse than windows when using ENB coupled with the fact that ENB itself misses a couple crucial features on Linux. Use steam-tinkerluanch for skyrim or other Bethesda games\n\n* Now onto FIFA is where it's the most problematic. FIFA's mod manager, is extremely buggy when launched with proton, the UI's glitchy and blank, it's impossible to use. Granted I've really not tinkered around much with it but it should give you an idea of how modding games with niche/unpopular mod managers will be like\n\nSo what do I do?

He's a leader in the back.", "created_utc": "1655848185.0", "edited": "False", "id": "id8bxc7", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_vhiqtm", "parent_id": "t1_id8ahhz", "score": "1", "subreddit": "soccer", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qi58"}, {"author": "bigphallusdino", "body": "If thats true, then don't lie out of your teeth.", "created_utc": "1655846991.0", "edited": "False", "id": "id89a1p", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_vhiqtm", "parent_id": "t1_id7s7ek", "score": "1", "subreddit": "soccer", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qi58"}, {"author": "bigphallusdino", "body": "Not OP, but I figured this out after I saw Kimiko's powers gone.", "created_utc": "1655843166.0", "edited": "False", "id": "id80t33", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_v5p59j", "parent_id": "t1_iby2397", "score": "2", "subreddit": "TheBoys", "subreddit_id": "t5_2t2xg"}, {"author": "bigphallusdino", "body": "no one asked + cry about it + ratio + didn't care + cope + stay mad + skill issue", "created_utc": "1655842991.0", "edited": "False", "id": "id80ffk", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_vgxolj", "parent_id": "t1_id7zy7f", "score": "5", "subreddit": "unixporn", "subreddit_id": "t5_2sx2i"}, {"author": "bigphallusdino", "body": "There's a difference on being a geek and being a neckbeard", "created_utc": "1655837928.0", "edited": "False", "id": "id7pnr5", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_vh8hq4", "parent_id": "t3_vh8hq4", "score": "2", "subreddit": "NoStupidQuestions", "subreddit_id": "t5_2w844"}, {"author": "bigphallusdino", "body": "It seems that you've topped your previous shit take.
