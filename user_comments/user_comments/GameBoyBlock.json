At the time I was 13ish 14 (now almost 17) and my school didn\u2019t offer Mandarin classes, so I decided to self study the language.\n\nAt first, I was simply just using some websites that I found on the internet for learning the language, like allsetlearning and chinesepod101, as well as beginner reading and listening material for Mandarin. I tried using a textbook to learn at one point in time, but after realizing how boring I found them to be for me in regards to language learning, I stopped.\n\nPandemic struck in 2020, and that gave me way more time to actually learn the language, so I decided to put more time and effort into my learning. I switched all my devices into Mandarin (including my computer), limited myself to only Chinese entertainment (music, videos, shows blogs, podcasts etc.), and downloaded more Chinese social media platforms and tried to use them and talk with more people on WeChat etc as well. I also did phone calls daily, though I have to admit, it was really difficult at first. I did take a break once in a blue moon though.\n\nI did hit a few periods of time (due to mental health issues as well as other internal and external issues) where I lost a good portion of my motivation and didn\u2019t know what I wanted to do with the language, but I still tried to keep myself going and eventually became much more motivated again.\n\nAs for time, I\u2019d say I spent at least 5-8 hours most days immersing in Chinese content and learning. I still had school for a majority of the time (those it was online), but the workload wasn\u2019t much during those years, and I was able to continue my language learning alongside it.

This is also coming from someone with bad vision.\n \nThere are no cases (which, in my case at least, made things easier), singulars and plurals aren\u2019t distinguished from the word themselves, but in context it\u2019s generally clear which is being referred to.\n\nThe person above telling you to only read Chinese texts written in Latin script is just setting you up for failure.

Getting used them is like a puzzle, but it gets way easier once you get into things. Once you start learning them, I recommend you learn what \u201cstroke order\u201d and \u201ccomponents\u201d are, and how to properly break down characters. This will make it way easier for you to learn in the long run once you get into learning Chinese characters. https://www.mslmaster.com/index.php/teaching-learning-resources/10-resources/60-strokes-components-and-radicals-of-chinese-characters and https://mandarinhouse.com/chinese-character-stroke-order are good pages that introduces these things.\n\nAnyway, of course, you should start with learning Pinyin, and how to read it, but that won\u2019t take fairly long, so once you get comfortable with Pinyin, you can start learning characters *through the vocabulary you learn* (and not independently) while looking up the readings w/ Pinyin.\n\nAgain, please don\u2019t listen to the user above, ignoring learning characters may be the worst piece of advice I\u2019ve seen in regards to learning Chinese on the entire internet.", "created_utc": "1637847601.0", "edited": "1637856306.0", "id": "hm16uyp", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_qzpl6g", "parent_id": "t1_hltdlni", "score": "2", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "GameBoyBlock", "body": "That\u2019s also another way to think of it, considering \u76f8 is the phonetic component in \u60f3.", "created_utc": "1637795890.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hlyqh11", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_r1exjz", "parent_id": "t1_hlyogo1", "score": "2", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "GameBoyBlock", "body": "If you\u2019re around an intermediate/advanced stage then it would be better to start learning from native material at that point.

Also, pretty much the majority of Chinese learning apps (mainly referring to the course-based ones) are targeted at beginners anyway, so they probably wouldn\u2019t be of that much of use to you.\n\nAs for reading, what generally slows people down when reading is an insufficient vocabulary/not recognizing a character, not knowing the grammar or not really getting the sentence is trying to say, knowing every word but not knowing how they function in the sentence/what the sentence is trying to express etc. The main key is to just keep reading, and look up what you don\u2019t know.\n\nWriting is another beast that does take some time to get proficient in doing. If you\u2019re trying to improve your writing skills in Chinese, the main key is just repetition, repetition, and repetition. I also recommend you learn stroke order if you haven\u2019t already, and how to properly break down the components of characters (for example, \u60f3 = \u6728 \u76ee \u5fc3), which will make it easier for you to remember them when actually writing.\n\nIt\u2019s best to start out practicing writing on one of those grid sheets meant for doing so, you can find a website to print them or get a book to practice. \n\nI recommend checking out this link: https://www.mslmaster.com/index.php/teaching-learning-resources/10-resources/60-strokes-components-and-radicals-of-chinese-characters", "created_utc": "1637787467.0", "edited": "1637788373.0", "id": "hly5whd", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_r1exjz", "parent_id": "t3_r1exjz", "score": "7", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "GameBoyBlock", "body": "Link Click is amazing, AOTY for me, can\u2019t wait for season 2.\n\nIf you want another good donghua, check out Mo Dao Zu Shi and Fei Ren Zai.", "created_utc": "1637786321.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hly2zvl", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_r11wvw", "parent_id": "t1_hlw3vnu", "score": "1", "subreddit": "teenagers", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjli"}, {"author": "GameBoyBlock", "body": "I find it useless and ineffective.", "created_utc": "1637124410.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hky8nu4", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_qvcz32", "parent_id": "t3_qvcz32", "score": "8", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "GameBoyBlock", "body": "It\u2019s really not as hard as some people make it out to be, though it may seem scary at first.
