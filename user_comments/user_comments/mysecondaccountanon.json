If you draw the line of defending people based on religion, then what about people who have a culture that is tied to religious practices. I am an Jew, but I am also an atheist. These two things are not concepts that exist separately, rather I am a Jewish atheist. While I am not religious in any way, I still participate in some of the religious practices, simply because they are a part of my culture, a part of which we as a people have been killed for millennia over. Like it or not, cultural identity is usually steeped in religion. This is especially the case for ethnoreligious groups, whose culture and ethnic background is tied to a religious background. Assuming that there is only bad and negatives to religion is also an idea that is also problematic, in my opinion, as it takes a very Christian-centric point of view and a very narrow point of view. Yes, some people from some religions have done bad things, but that doesn\u2019t mean that everyone in that religion is complicit in what they do.
