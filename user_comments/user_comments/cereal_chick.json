I've been having an anxiety attack for the last hour, I'm literally shaking, and I've just had to have a bunch of alcohol when I'm supposed to be fasting (*and* saving money) to calm myself down.\n\nI've admitted to my supervisor for my master's dissertation next year that I've done essentially no reading on the intended subject of my dissertation which I had to do because the maths department here doesn't teach it, even though we spoke about the reading I'd had to do a year and a half ago. I hadn't spoken to him basically all last year because I didn't want to make this admission, but I felt really bad when he emailed me today with opportunity for me and he remarked that it had been a while. I hope he doesn't now take it personally that I was incommunicado all that time; I was just ashamed.\n\nI managed to catch up on the essentials of linear multi-step methods for my numerics class; just barely though, my hand was shaking so bad I could barely write. I couldn't face a whole two hours of the lecture video for stochastic processes tonight, I'll have to do that tomorrow afternoon, before my next two hours of lectures on that subject. It's a bugger because stochastic processes is by far the most interesting of my modules this term; the rest are terminally boring. There's no complex analysis this week, so I have time to catch up on the lectures of that from last week. And my finance assessment is this Friday, and I'm hoping all the answers are in the lecture notes provided because I haven't been able to go to a single lecture in the module for weeks, but even if they are it'll take a whole bunch of looking up to do it.\n\nI had such big plans for this term. I was gonna wake up in time for all my lectures, and do my extracurricular stuff on top. Not just for the purposes of my dissertation next year, but for learning about all sorts of stuff that I'm interested in. And I do enjoy the extra work I set for myself; whenever I get a chance to do it, it's not like \"Ugh, I've gotta do my extracurriculars\", it's like \"Oh boy, I get to do my extracurriculars!\". But I've had no time; the few hours of the day I keep leaving myself, it's all got to be spent on catching up and keeping afloat. And I'm barely managing that. The thing I most fear is repeating last year, because I had to delay my exams just so I'd have the time to revise them, and I still did really badly in them.\n\nPlus, it interfered with the summer research I had, which I have to do if I want to get on a good PhD programme. Now I've added an extra year to study Mandarin, I have two more summers to do something in, but like, what do I put on my CV even? My marks from second year in the relevant modules? They're nothing special; firsts they may be, but they're not firsts to write home about. My summer supervisor, angel from heaven above that he is, was very understanding that I got consumed by anxiety and couldn't do any work on the project that he set me, and he said he was willing to write more good references for me, but I worry it all won't be enough.

For example, \n\n* the only irregular imperfects are those of *ser*, *ir*, and *ver*; all others are regular\n\n* All preterite endings are essentially the same (up to accents); only *ser* really changes things up, and even then, the essential structure of preterite endings are still visible\n\n* The future tense is formed by the infinitive plus the present tense of *haber*, and the conditional is formed by adding the imperfect suffixes of *haber* onto the infinitive\n\n* Almost every present subjunctive is formed by taking the first person present indicative form of the verb and adding the same suffixes depending on the conjugation class of the verb (suffixes in A for -er/-ir verbs, and suffixes in E for -ar verbs)\n\n* The two imperfect subjunctives and the future subjunctive are always formed from the third person plural by chopping off the RON bit and adding the same set of suffixes\n\nThe main annoyance in Spanish verbs is their habit of changing their stem, but again, there's only so many ways they can do this, so learning them all and where they apply is not as insurmountable a challenge as it may seem. You too can do it, and if you stick with Spanish long enough, it's inevitable that you will.

At an introductory level, if you asked this question you'd likely be told that squaring something has better algebraic properties than taking the absolute value, meaning it's easier to do algebra with. If you ever tried to derive the sample variance by finding the bias of the naive estimator for variance, you'll know what I mean.\n\nBut there's a deeper reason why we square to get the variance: it gives us a nicer structure when considering random variables as a unified whole rather than separately. You see, since we can add random variables and have all the nice properties of adding numbers, and since we can also scale random variables by a constant (and this also obeys nice rules), if we consider the set of all random variables, we can make a vector space out of it (an infinite-dimensional vector space, as it happens). And on that vector space (roughly speaking; we have to throw out a bunch of random variables in a technical way for it to work nicely), we can define an equivalent of the dot product (called an \"inner\" product): the covariance. And once you have an inner product, you can also define a \"norm\", or a notion of length, by taking the inner product of a vector with itself and square-rooting. If you take the covariance of a random variable with itself you get the variance, and if you square root it you get the standard deviation!\n\nOne way this helps clarify things is: as the dot product allows us to find the angle between two vectors in two- or three-dimensional space, the covariance allows us to find the \"angle\" between two random variables in the infinite-dimensional space they live in. We do this by taking the covariance and then dividing by the norms of the two variables, or rather their standard deviation, and thus we recover the formula for the correlation!\n\nSo we square things with variances and standard deviations, because the nice structure of an inner product requires us to have it that way.", "created_utc": "1661535817.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ilwb5rp", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_wwn8xw", "parent_id": "t1_ilvz459", "score": "2", "subreddit": "math", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh0n"}, {"author": "cereal_chick", "body": "If I were ever to get a tattoo, I would get one of the generalised Stokes theorem.", "created_utc": "1661534859.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ilw8pq6", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_wy9r44", "parent_id": "t3_wy9r44", "score": "36", "subreddit": "math", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh0n"}, {"author": "cereal_chick", "body": "[June Huh](https://www.quantamagazine.org/june-huh-high-school-dropout-wins-the-fields-medal-20220705/) has a similar-ish story, and he just won the most prestigious award in all of mathematics.", "created_utc": "1661534523.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ilw7urw", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_wydj8b", "parent_id": "t3_wydj8b", "score": "2", "subreddit": "math", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh0n"}, {"author": "cereal_chick", "body": "Happy cake day!", "created_utc": "1661468591.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ilsren9", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_wxry66", "parent_id": "t1_ilspzk4", "score": "2", "subreddit": "math", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh0n"}, {"author": "cereal_chick", "body": "This is false: the smallest counterexample is 3^2 + 2 = 11 which is not divisible by 3.

(Seriously, you spell better than a lot of native speakers.)\n\n1) \"even if\" should be \"even *though*\", because you're talking about something (the bad teaching in school) that is actually the case, rather than a hypothetical situation\n\n2) \"we starting learn\" should be \"we start learning\". For your purposes \"we starting\" is not grammatical at all; you can't put a present participle (\"start*ing*\") next to a pronoun with an auxiliary verb in between. We say either \"we are starting\" or \"we start\", and we pick the latter because you're describing a habitual situation instead of something that is happening right now. We could say either \"we start learning\" or \"we start to learn\", but the former is more natural\n\n3) \"when we grown up to the six or seven years old and until we become sixteen or eighteen years old\" has a number of problems. \"Grown\" is a past participle and thus cannot appear next to a pronoun without an auxiliary (either \"be\" or \"have\") in between. \"Grow up to the six [...] years old\" doesn't make sense; it's not a expression in English. Then \"until we become sixteen or eighteen years old\" just doesn't fit. The entire phrase needs rewriting, and there are a couple of ways you could do it:\n\n* \"we start learning it between the ages of six or seven and sixteen or eighteen\"\n\n* \"we start learning it from the ages of six or seven to the ages of sixteen or eighteen\"\n\n4) \"Most of people\" should be either \"most people\" or \"most of *the* people\", and your choice between them is entirely free given what you're saying next\n\n5) \"I've knew\" should be \"I've *known*\"; \"knew\" is the preterite/past tense and \"known\" is the past participle, the latter of which forms the present perfect that you used perfectly correctly\n\n6) \"English isn't needed to us\" doesn't make sense; you could say instead \"English isn't *necessary* *for* us\", or \"we don't need English\"\n\n7) \"about almost two years ago\" doesn't work, I think because \"about\" demands a space to itself in front of the noun. If you want to say \"a bit less than\" and \"approximately\" about the same quantity, then I'd say \"almost two years ago *roughly*\"\n\n8) \"I learning\" should be \"I am learning\". I think I've figured it out now; you're omitting the present tense of \"to be\" because that's what you do in Russian. Suffice it to say you *must* say the present tense of \"to be\" when it occurs in English; while there are dialects where it's colloquial to drop it in the ways you do, affecting that sort of speech has to be a deliberate decision which you can only make after you become much more proficient in the language, and indeed when you are immersed in the culture surrounding those dialects. For your purposes, as I say, you should treat doing so as a mistake.\n\n9) \"fix it ups\" should first be \"fix it up\", as \"ups\" is not a word. While you could \"fix up\" your English and it's not *wrong*, it's a highly unnatural choice; better would be \"improve\" or \"refine\"\n\n10) \"I'll be very thanked for it\" is where you've got the word \"thank\" the wrong way around; *you* will be thanking *me*, and hence *I* will be thanked by *you*. It is also an unnatural thing to say (although I really appreciate it!

Flipped classrooms are the WORST IDEA IN EDUCATION, and if you make your class flipped, you will make your students' lives hell for no reason whatsoever. The model of delivering content in the contact hours has worked for almost a thousand years of university education. What happens if you make the students watch lectures by themselves is that the time your students have to dedicate to your course doubles without doubling the content they learn. It takes such a psychological toll to have to find the space in your free time to learn the content *whilst also* having contact hours they have to make as well. I had just one flipped class last term, and it was a major contributor to my academic life falling apart that term; I ended up having to delay that exam alongside a bunch of others, and I *didn't fucking learn anything*. There is a reason we've had lectures for so long: in a lecture, you can have pacing, and examples adjoined to the theory, and it makes everything stick better than just having to speedrun an hour's (in practice actually anything up to twice that long because without the pacing of a lecture, you have to keep pausing the video to make your notes) videos on the week's content.\n\n*There is no need to innovate for innovation's sake.* Yes, the traditional lecture model is antiquated, because as we've established it's been in existence for almost a thousand years; yes, it's a pre-internet learning model, but's survived this long BECAUSE IT WORKS. And we've tried the alternative: we spent the whole of lockdown needlessly changing the established formula, and we have the data to say it was a COLOSSAL FAILURE that burdened students to no purpose.\n\nFor God's sake, just teach a class like a normal person. I guarantee you not one of your students will complain if you do that. They won't even conceive the possibility of there being a \"better\" way of having their class, because there is nothing wrong with their class as-is.

On the very first page of actual mathematics, there are superscripts with subscripts, and I actually read it wrong when I wrote down the definition it involved. The bottom of that same page has the general form of a Taylor series of a general function from \u211d^? to \u211d^? (there was an *n* somewhere, and I'm a bit drunk atm, and he didn't put it in a formal definition or theorem or anything; the actual lemma was about a \"good enough\" Taylor series for functions that are merely C^(\u221e), the proof of which I picked up quite quickly) using the same notation, so that was a trip.\n\nThe exercise I tried yesterday reminded me why I'm doing maths, and I'll sketch it out for you because it was quite cool. The question concerned f(x), where f(x) = e^(-1/x) for x > 0 and f(x) = 0 for x <= 0. The point is that this is an example of a C^(\u221e)-smooth function which is not real-analytic everywhere (specifically, it's not real-analytic at 0 because all its derivatives there are 0, so the Taylor series there is identically 0, and for any neighbourhood of 0 there is a part of the function which is not 0, so Taylor series != f(x) for that neighbourhood), and it's canonical enough an example that Roger Penrose cited this exact same function to make the exact same point in his *The Road to Reality*.\n\nThe question began with a straightforward induction to prove that for x > 0, all derivatives of order k were of the form e^(-1/x) times a polynomial in 1/x of degree 2k, and I finished that off easily enough. The next part of the question was more interesting; it read:\n\n> Prove that *f* is C^(\u221e) on \u211d and that *f*\\^(k)(0) = 0 for all k >= 0\n\nEverywhere but x = 0, this was trivial: either all derivatives would be 0 (for x < 0), which is continuous trivially, or they would be of the form I proved by induction in the previous part, which is continuous by the algebra of continuous functions. But at x = 0, there would be a problem. Not a difficult problem, since the question says all derivatives must be 0 there, but it wouldn't be completely trivial to show this. I decided to attack the problem with one-sided limits. From the left, there wouldn't be a problem; it only remained (as I saw it; I might be horribly wrong here) to prove that the right-sided limit would also be 0.\n\nI initially went about this a stupid way; remembering my algebra of limits from my first real analysis class, I split the limit into the e^(-1/x) term and the polynomial in 1/x term. The former would go to 0 in the limit quite patently, and then if I could bound the polynomial in 1/x, I could get my limit. Immediately after thinking of this, I thought \"well, how the fuck am I gonna do that??\", because (in my estimation) it can't actually be done; all the powers of 1/x are gonna blow up massively in the vicinity of 0. But no fear! For I quickly realised I could do it with l'H\u00f4pital's rule: put the polynomial in 1/x in the numerator and e^(1/x) in the denominator. I stumbled a little here, realising that one or two applications wouldn't do it, but it occurred to me that I had to \"run out the clock\" on the polynomial in the numerator: if I applied the rule 2k + 1 times, I would differentiate the numerator 2k + 1 times and get 0 there, and that was the limit I wanted.\n\nAs I say, I am a bit drunk recounting this, and I didn't get as far as *actually* applying l'H\u00f4pital's rule like this: it might not work out like I said. But I think I'm good for it.

He doesn't shy away from making you sit down and memorise paradigms, which there is no getting away from in a highly inflected language like Latin, but the constant exercises drill them and the vocab into you quite effectively. It's a very no-bullshit approach, and it works wonders on me.\n\nThere's also [a Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/SoYouReallyWantToLearnLatin) which seems to follow the course structure quite closely and which you might like to also use. You can study just out of the book and not use the videos at all (as I do), but I don't know if it goes the other way; I reckon you probably could though.\n\nIf you want to use the books, then you should get the first one (AND its answer book! The answer books are nonnegotiable, although you might struggle to find them) and see how you like it, and if you do, you should get the other two (AND their answer books!). They bill themselves as bringing you from scratch up to \"GCSE level and beyond\"; GCSEs being sat by kids your age, whether they will entirely suffice for AP depends on how far \"beyond\" goes, and I couldn't possibly say (the final chapter of the third book touches on who to read in both verse and prose, and goes over what look like the basics of reading Latin verse). Regardless, if you study them all the way through to the end, you will have learnt a great deal.\n\nGood luck!\n\nEDIT: I will say that one (small) problem with Oulton's books is that sometimes he leaves things out of the main book and puts them in the answer book instead. Like several times the answer given has a possessive determiner that one was supposed to infer from before possessive determiners are taught, without ever saying that this is permissible in translation. Another example is using \"-ne\" to form a question: the book says to place it on the first word in the sentence, but only the answer book will tell you that you have to suspend the normal rules of Latin syntax (such as you know them at this point) to move the word that carries the emphasis in the question to the front and *then* stick \"-ne\" on it.

I'll take you through the group axioms and then how you identify groups.\n\nFirstly, the formal definition: a group (G, \u2218) is a set G equipped with a binary operation \u2218 such that the four groups axioms hold:\n\n1) *Closure*: for any two elements a and b in G, a \u2218 b is also in G\n\n2) *Associativity*: for any three elements a, b, and c in G, (a \u2218 b) \u2218 c = a \u2218 (b \u2218 c)\n\n3) *Identity*: there exists an element e in G such that for any element a in G, e \u2218 a = a \u2218 e = a\n\n4) *Inverses*: for every element a in G, there exists an element a^(-1) in G such that a \u2218 a^(-1) = a^(-1) \u2218 a = e\n\nClosure is about the group being the entire universe of what you're talking about, essentially. If you need to leave the set for any reason related to the operation you impose on it, then your set is not big enough to be worth talking about. The failure of closure is a very trivial way to fail to be an algebraic structure, so it's often omitted at higher levels, or subsumed into the definition of a binary operation.\n\nAssociativity is a bit of an odd one if you're not used to higher mathematics. Recall that we said \u2218 was a *binary* operation: that means it can only take in two elements and return a third. When we want to do the operation with three elements instead, we can't, not directly; we can only do it with two elements at a time. So when we want to do the operation with three or more elements, we in principle have to put brackets in the expression to say which pair we're doing first and which element we leave out to operate with the result of the first pair (and so on and so forth for more elements). Associativity is the really nice property that it *doesn't matter* where we put the brackets, that we will always get the same thing. This means that when we have multiple elements all operating together, we can omit the brackets and the expression will be unambiguous.\n\nIdentity is, as you say, a \"neutral\" element; when we combine it with any other element, we get that element back as though we had done nothing at all. Inverses thus means that no matter what element we start with, there is another element we can combine it with to get back the identity.\n\nLet's try an example. We're going to prove that the integers form a group under addition. We have closure, because when you add two integers you always get another integer. We have associativity, because, say, (3 + 4) + 5 = 3 + (4 + 5), and so on for all other integers. We have an identity, namely 0, because 0 + 1 = 1 + 0 = 1, for example. And we have inverses, because given any integer, say 5, we can get back to 0 by adding minus that number: 5 + (-5) = (-5) + 5 = 0.\n\nIt turns out that finite groups have this very nice property where if you write a \"multiplication table\" (called a Cayley table) of all of its elements \u2013 a row and a column for every element, where the cells show the result of combining the element for that row and column using the group operation \u2013 it forms something called a Latin square. A Latin square is a table of entries such that every entry occurs only once in every row and column; you can see an example on [the Wikipedia page for Latin squares](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_square). So when you have trouble deciding if a finite set with an operation is a group or not, simply construct its Cayley table and see if you get a Latin square. It's time-consuming to do this in general or for large groups, but it's one way of doing it.\n\nAs for your example of \"(I, o)\", I have no idea what this could be.

If the p-value is too large (usually taken to be more than 0.05, or five standard deviations as the person above says for particle physics), then we conclude that the risk of wrongly rejecting the null is too high and we *fail to reject*: that's important terminology; we can't prove the null hypothesis because we assumed it to do the test. If, on the other hand, the p-value is small enough, we take that as sufficient evidence to reject the null and declare the alternative hypothesis proven. Note that the p-value does *not* reflect the probability that the null hypothesis is true, as under a frequentist framework of probability it is not meaningful to assign probabilities to hypotheses being true. To talk about such things, as I say, you have to move into a Bayesian framework.", "created_utc": "1646711841.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hzsoemm", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_t97b9m", "parent_id": "t1_hzsm8gi", "score": "4", "subreddit": "math", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh0n"}, {"author": "cereal_chick", "body": "If you stopped caring about maths in high school, then I find it highly unlikely that you are ready for calculus, because calculus requires you to be au fait with basically all the stuff from high school.
