Maybe I could go with the brown one, but again, idk how it feels as an only watch.

While im not realy a fan of the chrono (not sure I want a blue dial and it feel cluttered on the white and black dials), the big date plain dial version looks super promising! I will certainly look into that one further.\n\n> Chopard Alpine Eagle Small\n\nHonestly, I just detest chunky bezels, so I hate basically all of the integrated bracelet sports watches (VC Overseas, naut, RO, etc). Only exception to that rule is is the Parmigiani Fleurier [Tonda GT in white](https://d2j6dbq0eux0bg.cloudfront.net/images/16115183/2995983582.jpg)/[Oliver Smith tondagraph colab](https://www.ablogtowatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Parmigiani-Tonda-GT-Oliver-Smith-6-1024x576.jpg), but they are just too big for my wrist unfortunately", "created_utc": "1662842489.0", "edited": "False", "id": "inwh0vj", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_x9d4xo", "parent_id": "t1_inw9jh6", "score": "1", "subreddit": "Watches", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qls5"}, {"author": "eskamobob1", "body": "Welcome to the hobby!\n\n> I am considering an automatic movement.for this new watch, but what I'm unsure of the lifespan.\n\nThe life span of any decent watch will basically just be \"forever\". technically some components will wear down after ~50-100 years of daily wear and no longer be replaceable, but that's basically it. The only caveat is that mechanical watches require servicing. It will depend on the specific watch, manufacturer, and usage (for example, yearly gasket checks make sense if you dive with it) but once every 5-10 years is pretty common for a watch that gets worn a lot.\n\n>  If I am not wearing it for longer than the reserve period is it fine to just pick the watch up and wind it up again?\n\nAbsolutely! If you get getting an automatic, you wont even need to wind it much either. Just one or two turns and let the rotor do the rest. No need to worry about hurting it, you just need to know that you will need to reset the time/functions if you let it die.\n\n> And it's ok to just keep doing that every time I want to wear it?\n\nIt absolutely is! In fact, you only really need to wind it when you want to wear it. if you wear it twice a year, it may be good practice to wind it once a month just so the oil stays alright, but that's really it.\n\n> Should I be aware of anything else?\n\nLots and lots of stuff you can learn, but I think really the three main things to know is that higher complications mean higher service costs (chronos/perpetuals/etc are fairly spendy to service) but the dealer should know pretty good ball park on service costs for the watch. The second one is that 30m of water resistance really mean \"do not get this wet at all\". 30m will allow you to splash back a bit while washing your hands, but no watching dishes or going in the pool even if you hand is 1ft under the water max. You dont want to start doing those things until you have 50-100m (5-10atm/150-300ft) of water resistance. Lastly, you shouldnt treat your watch like a g-shock. Some brands are *extremely* durable (rolex and RM make this a point of pride specifically) but even still, don't go boxing, get super into your drumming sessions, or do other super high impact sports with them if you don't want to do more regular services. I personally don't worry about spontaneous activity and swap over to a smart watch when im being active (mountain biking, playing sports, etc) for the better feature set anyways, but its just something to keep in mind.\n\nI know thats a ton to read but feel free to ask whatever other questions may be on your mind if more come up! this sub tends to be pretty great about answering questions like these", "created_utc": "1662840533.0", "edited": "False", "id": "inwc9pe", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_x9d4xo", "parent_id": "t1_inupjh1", "score": "3", "subreddit": "Watches", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qls5"}, {"author": "eskamobob1", "body": "Was it a gift?

No real need to specify them but I like alarm functions so I'd like to have at least one of those, and i use date more than time on my watches so that will idealy be on all 3. Maybe 1 simple, one alarm, and one more complex (calander/chrono/etc) but not sure.\n3. Dial design - ideally I'd like no overlap between dial color, general dial layout/design (so for example I have no desire to own both a a 4 central hand alarm and a central hand piinter date nor two black dial watches)\n\nI think as is standard I can't afford my ideal collection, but something along the lines of: \n\n* yellowed tritium lume submariner/explorer - this is the daily. Understated, probabaly on a rough leather strap or a nato. Just downright abuse it and move on.\n* grand seiko snow dial (can't rember the number) - the white dial dress watch. Intersting movement and clearly extremely well made but not going to raise an eye from anyone who doesn't know.\n* GO PanoRetroGraph - the budget blower with the awesome complications. 30 day alarm and even a count down timer, this is the \"ima show off to the watch folks but don't like the look of a turbski\".
