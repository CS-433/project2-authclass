But it's becoming more and more obvious (though still not very obvious for many many Chinese) that Xi is driving China down a road it might not be able to recover from. The focus of the country's wealth has been towards building a military industrial complex to rival the US and engineering projects. Longest bridge, largest rail network, largest manmade canal, etc. The problem is china is facing a plethora of domestic issues. China is now the most expensive country to raise a child (competitive education, too much to describe you'd have to Google it yourself). However the country's birth rate has almost stalled. And considering the disastrous one child policy from generations prior, a huge population shrink is looming and China does not look prepared at all. CCP Chairman usually get a ten-year term. Xi has gotten a few extra years as he's modeled himself to be the next great Chinese leader after Mao, one that will bring china to new heights and start, as they put it here, The Chinese Century. Everyone bought in to the idea that this century was china's for the taking and it will become theirs with might and economic prowess alone. But all China has done is ostracize themselves from the global stage, living out their own \"us versus the world\" cosplay that they get off on over here. With the election coming up, there's speculation that Xi's support is starting to diminish. That being said, he will get elected again.

When I was 27 I was in the exact same boat. Living with the parents. Doing a part time job bartending, no friends as they all left town doing their own things. Not sure what kind of work you want to do in Thailand (teaching?) but you can be a teacher in Cambodia without a degree, legally. It is not required for a work visa. Right next door to Thailand and culturally, geographically similar. I started teaching in China without a degree and managed to do a bachelors online that allowed me to get a work visa just in time for covid. If I hadn't, I'd back to square one.\n\nMy life has been up and down but an absolute adventure. You have times like these where you feel like a ship without sails, floating with no direction. That is absolutely 100% FINE. For me I started filling the time with stuff. The best was exercise, it really will boost your mood.  I think the best advice I could give would be to make a habit. In fact, fill your day with specific habits at specific times. It gives the time you spend a framework. Oh, it's 5AM, time to get up and go for a jog. It's 6AM, I should shower and eat, I've got nothing to do until 8 so I can do some reading or watch youtube or anything. Sounds asinine but really try giving it a shot. When you feel down, your habits will be there to keep your mind on track. Then make a goal. \"I want to go to Thailand.\" Your day to day habits will keep your mind occupied while also giving you something to work towards over a longer period. Heck if Thailand is your goal, try learning Thai so when you land, you can make the locals smile. I learned Chinese by myself to a proficient degree before I came and I'm retarded. Learning a language is not as difficult as it seems. You can do it, you got this.\n\nOther than that, man, life is your boat to navigate. As cliche as it is to say you can do anything, having been where you are at the exact same age, you really can live a life that you desire. I even tried to kill myself on my 25th birthday because I felt no control in my life and felt I had nothing to live for. Now at 33 I look back and think how I ever got to that point. I would have missed out on the best 8 years of my life if I had gone through with it. We don't know what the future holds but luck favors the prepared.

Can't blame them, have they had to do that since the 70s? The middle class has exploded and everyone's wealth has been buoyed by international investment. People associate it with the CCP being cunning. But it won't be like that a decade from now.

Most foreign news sites are blocked, foreign social media like Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, etc. Google is blocked because, well, you can find anything there, along with Wikipedia. Duolingo was blocked for some reason recently that had something to do with the weekly competition groups. So users that noticed those disappear last year, that's why. Interestingly, when I got here some years ago, Reddit was not blocked and even a handful of my local Chinese friends used reddit. Once people on Reddit started talking about what was happening in Hong Kong and Xinjiang, it got blocked. There are, of course, work arounds. I have a VPN on my computer and phone for instance. But downloading VPNs is difficult because they've been removed from app stores and their websites are blocked. There are instances where China allows VPNs. For example, I worked at an Australian law firm in Beijing and our network was allowed to have a VPN, it would simply be impossible to find international legal standards in English on Chinese internet  There are numerous foreign companies in Beijing that are approved to have VPNs. I have a hunch that the CCP knows plenty of people have VPNs for personal use and simply allows it because without them, a lot of foreigners living here simply would leave; a lot of foreign sites block traffic from China since it's an origin of a lot of cyber attacks.  I've gotten locked out of bank accounts back home when I forgot to turn on my VPN because it assumed my login info was compromised by someone in China. And also anytime there are CCP congress meetings in Beijing, maybe two or three times a year, everyone's VPN acts like shite for about a week. It's like they just turned off the ability for VPNs to function, then everything goes back to normal when the meetings are over. So I'm pretty sure they know we use VPNs but are desperate for foreigners to come here, so they allow it.\n\nOn a side note, it's interesting to me that the CCP puts so much effort into internet censorship but you can go to any bookstore and buy translated copies of Orwell's *1984*", "created_utc": "1645224735.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hxiaydn", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_svh08m", "parent_id": "t1_hxgknaf", "score": "30", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "LeddyTasso", "body": "Thanks, Harvard", "created_utc": "1645089456.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hxadn3h", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_su7tmy", "parent_id": "t1_hx8h6iw", "score": "1", "subreddit": "CFB", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qm9d"}, {"author": "LeddyTasso", "body": "Yep.

English has pitch and intonation. Think of this line: \"you don't have your keys, do you?\" Now think of that line with the intonation going up at the end, and then again going down at the end. The first is more a serious question and the second is more rhetorical, like you already know the answer and are maybe irritated that they don't have their keys. Right? We use intonation in English to  change the meaning/nature of what we say all the time, it's just very subtle. Tonal languages kind of have the same idea but it's not subtle at all. \n\n In the case of Chinese, one differentiates similar sounding words based on the context of everything else being said. The word for want/miss/think is \u60f3 xi\u01ceng, and the sound xiang is actually quite common, tones notwithstanding. \u50cf xiang to seem/appear/resemble, \u5411 xi\u00e0ng towards, \u9999 xiang fragrant all have similar sounds but varying tones. But you're never going to hear \u6211\u50cf\u5403\u8089 I resemble eat meat, or \u6211\u9999\u5403\u8089 I fragrant eat meat. Those just don't make sense. You'll know by context that it's \u60f3 and the speaker is talking about wanting to eat meat. So hearing the words isn't too much of a hassle. To remember them you just have to internalize the tone with the sound.\n\nThe only thing for me that made it difficult to learn tones is that it's just awkward starting out. You'll feel like a singsong goofball going AAA aaAA AaA AA and you'll think omg these people will think I sound like a nut. But give it a few weeks/months of just talking out loud in the target language and you'll be more comfortable doing it. So don't feel like you're the only one not getting it. It just takes getting used to. \n\nAFAIK languages with alphabets like Thai have the tone built into the letter so there's not as much sound crossover when learning different words. But I haven't dived onto Thai (yet) so feel free to correct me if I'm wrong. \n\nOther than that, just jump in and get your feet wet.

Really had to nit-pick by the end and some of the later points of each aren't much of a big deal. Bottom line is I would suggest Japanese to try this method out but read below if you want some ideas to consider.\n\nFor japanese: no tones, grammatical markers tell you what parts of the sentence go where, verb comes last, conjugation at least tells you tense and main action, fewer phonemes than Chinese, japanese transliteration of foreign words is more straightforward and sounds closer to the original word \n\nAgainst japanese: syllabary limits number of phonemes which means words might sound similar (not too big of a deal IMO), myth that japanese isn't tonal (i.e. n\u012bppon or nipp\u014dn, Japan or two bottles?), I can't really think of others right now\n\nFor Chinese: four tones are not as difficult as made out to be and listening to slower Chinese will make it easier to get use to the tones, Chinese is mostly SVO for word order so if you speak English it will be more familiar, \n\nAgainst Chinese: has tones that can be tricky when first starting out, regional variances of mandarin make listening to speakers from across the sinosphere chaotic sometimes (my in-laws from northern china cannot pronounce ch, zh, sh to save their lives. Always pronounce to as c, z, or s), regional variances can also affect tones meaning what might be first tone in standard mandarin could be third tone in say Yunnan province and it's up to you to know wtf they're saying, each word has a tone? except when in context to the words around it which can then force the tone to change meaning some words can be said with all four tones depending on what comes before or after and again, up to you to figure out the patterns for that, Chinese transliteration of foreign words is not accurate because many words were originally transliterated in Cantonese and mandarin simply adopted the character (eng New York =Canto nau yohk = mand nyoh yuweh, eng Cheese - canto jeesee - mand zhirshir)(I know this isn't standard pin yin but probably the best way to actualize the sounds for someone that speaks neither Cantonese or mandarin)", "created_utc": "1640592205.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hq4ickc", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_rpe0ue", "parent_id": "t3_rpe0ue", "score": "3", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "LeddyTasso", "body": "Plus japanese has grammatical markers that tell you \"This is the subject\", \"this is the object\", etc. I remember seeing a graph comparing perceived difficult of japanese and Chinese grammar over the depth of understanding (in comparison to English).

But Chinese grammar gets more and more complicated the deeper you go whereas japanese tends to even out. In other words, japanese grammar tends to have fewer irregularities in the more complex grammar whereas Chinese becomes more irregular. When I studied japanese the hardest part was te forms.

So I absolutely believe Assimil can get on onto the B2 level. \n\nThe way I'm setting up my study for both languages is I will spend 30 minutes on a new lesson around lunch time, add unknown sentence structures to an Anki deck and study those throughout the afternoon and evening. In the morning when I wake up I spend another 30 minutes translating the English text from the lesson from the previous  day into the TL, listen to the audio while correcting any mistakes I made in the translation, then spend some time shadowing the audio. I've started the German book two days before the French book so the review lessons every 7th lesson does not overlap with each other and I can focus reviewing on one language each review lesson. In total that's an hour with Assimil for each language everyday plus 20-30 minutes of reviewing sentence structures. \n\nSo far, french is going smoothly and I'm considering doing two lessons at a time because I am getting through this system in about 30 minutes a day for french. \n\nWhen I finish Assimil for both, I will move into reading texts in the TL paired with glossika. I did this with Mandarin with amazing success. About 15-20 minutes of glossika Chinese three times a day, with reading the Chinese version of Dragonball on my comute or when laying on the couch, bed, etc. I'm not the biggest manga/comic fan but I have to admit, having the pictures really helps tie in the context of the TL.

Chinese is not too difficult actually. It's just a little uncomfortable to learn. There are 4 tones in Mandarin and it's awkward, if you've never spoken a tonal language before, to have to be super conscious of how your voice goes up and down. But there is a rhythm to it and the more you practice sentences and listen to spoken Chinese, you'll start to feel the flow. That being said, you initially learn that one character has one sound and one tone but this eventually becomes not true the more you learn. Chinese is highly contexual so the tones and sounds can change depending on what words are before and after. For instance \u884c can be pronounced like x\u00edng to mean to go or OK and also pronounced h\u00e1ng for a place to do some kind of business like a bank (\u94f6\u884c y\u00ednh\u00e1ng) The sentence order mostly follows SVO like English so it's easy to start making simple sentences. This also changes a bit, especially with \u628a and \u88ab sentences where it can be like SOV. The characters seem daunting at first but if you learn the most basic 200 or so, all the others are made at of those. Makes it easy to memorize the word when you know \u65e5 means sun and \u6708 means moon and together they make \u660e bright. This even goes for full characters and words. And that's one of the best parts of Chinese. Since there aren't letters to just craft a new word out of thin air, preexisting characters are used to develop new words. If I told you that \u624b means hand and \u673a means machine, could you guess what a \u624b\u673a  hand machine is? Hint: you use it everyday, probably every hour and are probably using it to read this post right now. Chinese is rife with words like hand machine for cell phone, electric ladder for elevator, business goose for penguin. That makes it extremely easy to remember words. So, Chinese isn't very hard in my opinion.

I'll chime in I guess. There's some truth to what everyone is saying and some nontruth. Hawaii, unlike most other states, was a full functioning kingdom for hundreds of years before Europeans and Americans showed up. Missionaries, with the help of US Marines sent by President McKinley, overthrew the monarchy and established a republic, which then became a territory, which led to statehood. Federal government has from day one drawn the ire of the residents here. Politically, there's not really anything going on in DC that affects us, so sometimes it's like we are detached from everything. Hawaii is a microcosm of every environmental calamity awaiting the world. We have limited resources, limited space, limited farmland, limited real estate. The oceans are rising and making the islands smaller by the year. It's true that the world's mega rich show up and gobble up real estate for vacation homes, taking livable space from the locals and jacking up prices. The roads were made a hundred years ago when it was just horses and buggies going to the market. A 3 hour commute over 25 miles isn't unheard of. Just throw a shaka out the window if someone let's you into the lane. If you want a fantastic depiction of what the socioeconomic theme in Hawaii is like, I cannot recommend enough for you to watch The White Lotus. Did you know homeless people in the mainland save up their money to buy one way tickets to Hawaii? Hey, no winter, amirite?\n\nBut, if you want to come to Hawaii, you are more than welcome. It takes time to get friendly with the locals, I'll admit. That's because most people that move here from the mainland end up leaving after some time, whether it's the military, or they have some disillusioned perception that Hawaii is this tropical paradise where you can align your chakras. A lot of people from the mainland think locals are rude or being mean, but actually we just love to tease people. We tease everyone, you just need some thick skin. Hawaii can feel small after a while though. I knew a lot of people that came here and after a few years felt like they were stuck on a rock and went back.

Nowhere near it. I self studied up to HSK4. I can hold conversations on a variety of topics with people I meet, express opinions and emotions, etc. Most importantly I can be in China and not freak out . I used Duolingo maybe a year after I started and tested through about 70%. In my opinion, Duolingo isn't terrible for learning mandarin. It's not complete but honestly offered some good lessons.\n\nWhat worked best for me was New practical Chinese Reader volumes 1 and 2. I don't think I even finished vol2 as it is a bit dry. I also used the Chinese grammar wiki. Understated resource, I love it so much I bought the ebooks just to support what they're doing. I used chineseclass101. Did about two lessons a day for three months. \n\nBy this time my Chinese was about hsk 2 or low hsk 3. I started doing reading. Mandarin Companion make a great series of graded readers that I can't recommend enough. I also have to shout out the graded readers by Jeff Pepper and Xiao Hui Wang. They make a graded readers series based on the Journey to the West. So not only do you practice Chinese, you learn China's most beloved folk tale. My only gripe with theirs is that the format changes between the first and second book and I rather dislike the second books format \n\nThis one might be hard to do outside of China, but I got the Chinese Kindle app and bought the Dragonball manga in Chinese. They're super helpful and really cheap, like US$1 a book. Graphic novels are great as you can pull context from the images. And they're entertaining.\n\nNext I went through Assimil Chinese. It was mostly a review but the grammar explanations solidified my understanding of concepts. Definitely don't miss this resource.\n\nLastly, I have an Anki deck that i update with words I want to remember. I don't recommend premade decks as they are too broad and you will not remember the words that you don't want to remember . So making one with the words and phrases you'll use often is best.\n\nOther than that, best of luck. You can do it.

I didn't really have much interest in Bama until I got there. They went 7-6 that year with a bowl win over Colorado IIRC. The '08 season was wild. My expectations weren't high. but something happened when we went into UGA for their blackout game. Good thing they all wore black; that was a damn funeral game for them. Since that game, they hype was on for me.   \n\n\nFast forward to now, Death Star Bama and Tyrannasaban Rex. I would say I have maybe 80% of the excitement for the regular season as I did when a student. Hell I don't even live in the States anymore so sometimes I just have to settle for watching highlights on YouTube. I guess I still cling to how fun it was to travel to all the SEC stadiums and mingle with the home fans. SEC fans are great (on the fence about LSU fans though. I specifically remember the away fans throwing trash onto the student section below during the 9-6 Game of the Century). I love visiting Arkansas and MSU for some reason. Ole Miss was great, of course. Even Knoxville was fun too. But back then Bama fans were a bit more humble and the team was I guess on par with everyone else in the conference. I don't know what all has changed and if everyone is as welcoming as they were back then. Back then it was still just plain fun. I had friends that had gone to a couple different schools around the SEC, so there was still this small community feel to the SEC and hey lets watch some ball while we're at it type feel.   \n\n\nI do feel a bit bummed that it's almost like watching the NFL now though. It seems less like I'm watching the game for the whole team and more like I'm watching star players and their crazy stats rack up. There was, in fact, a time when Alabama players weren't stacking the draft boards and were just playing the game. But things change I guess. Sometimes I wonder if it's just the nostalgia of college years that keep me watching. I have forgotten what I felt that 2010 season when Alabama went 10-3 and lost to the game cocks ,LSU, and that cow college over there. On one hand, I would love that feeling of 'oh man, are we going to make it or not' that we had during the BCS era, but I also feel devastated when we lose. I wouldn't give up the decade of dominance though. There's a lot of pride to be had in that.   \n\n\nOh, what am I saying.
