Regardless of medium her own work is so visibly her own. She and Trixie joke a lot about merging artistically to the point of being indistinguishable, but Katya hasn't budged from her little niche at all through the years. \n\nThat queen we saw all those years ago doing a Lana number with the only gimmick being she would fall on the floor every 30s is the very same mind behind: Trish, a genuinely unique piece of comedic character work; Be Your Own Dentist, a horrifying yoga/meditation tape; and the only good parody of Kidman's AMC commercial we see here. They couldn't possibly be more distinct individually but all make complete sense when you know who is behind them.\n\nAnd that's why her pairing with Trixie makes perfect sense. While Trixie's whole thing is broadening her appeal and audiences by admittedly reshaping herself to be more digestible, Katya is this ridiculously stubborn anchor to a commitment to artistic vision. Katya needs Trixie to push her out into the world between her passion projects so she stays paid and relevant and Trixie needs Katya so that she's aware that no matter how thinly she stretches herself she has something to fall back on. \n\nEw, an r/rpdrcringe essay.

Take it with a Salar de Uyuni's worth of savory savory NaCl.\n\nI get it. I do. Dedicating a lot of yourself to something you're passionate about and feeling like you're swimming against a structural current that is nullifying your efforts to an infuriating extent. That transforming into impotent rage. Rage that burns brighter when you're thoroughly aware it's *still* not enough to make you quit. It's agonizing. You mentioned seeing other adult skaters give up and resume their lives and I'm sure in your frustration it almost reads as a sign that you should follow their lead, even when you know that's simply not happening. It's why I'm a little reticent to endorse some of the suggestions here to just strike out and create opportunities for yourself as sometimes that's not what you want. As you've said you want your efforts acknowledged and a sense of belonging *because* you've given so much of yourself to your town's skating community.\n\nAnd yet it looks like your rage is being severely misdirected. Just way too much of your post is comparing yourself to actual children who as you well know are not making a concerted effort to get to you specifically. I'm not one to lecture anyone on how to properly harness their feelings but this truly read like a grown adult minimizing the efforts of people around them, and that's not healthy for you *or* them. In this sub we've had plenty of discussions on how skating rinks are particularly conducive to toxic atmospheres and I don't think *you* want to contribute to that, yet even if you're not verbalizing it to those other skaters it feels like you are. I mean, you're quite literally comparing your skill level with that of minors *and* fellow adults whose individual circumstances may be all but completely unknown to you. \n\n\"You could be starving in Africa!\" is profoundly tone deaf and you're cognizant of this yourself. I'm all for venting out your frustrations in anonymous forums in lieu of blowing up on strangers, people generally want to bottle that up and just try making that a topic in therapy but I see the value in just screaming into the void. However, when you do, please don't shape the void after minors. Frustration doesn't have to convert itself into something productive, but maybe you can take some time to think things through and perhaps find *some* balance that works for your individual situation. \n\nAgain and finally, I'm not chastising you for ranting here and am sincerely looking forward to a next thread where you mention some of the ways you've found either to cope or rise above your present circumstances. But when you feel that anger welling up again just like you did here, you have a choice on which direction to aim it at and I promise it feels better when it's aimed correctly.", "created_utc": "1664295800.0", "edited": "1664296108.0", "id": "iq4d5np", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_xpgtub", "parent_id": "t3_xpgtub", "score": "68", "subreddit": "FigureSkating", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rld6"}, {"author": "ligneouslimb", "body": "Oh sure but that's kinda what I was trying to get at.
