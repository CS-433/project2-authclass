However, a dairy allergy is a *completely different* mechanism from lactose intolerance. Lactose is a specific sugar found in dairy broken down with lactase. Lactose intolerance means you don\u2019t naturally produce enough lactase to digest lactose easily. A dairy allergy means you are allergic to the PROTEINS in milk. Very different.\n\nLactose intolerance is often fixed with Lactaid. It\u2019s also often better/worse with certain forms of dairy \u2014 hard cheese is usually easier to digest because the lactose content is lower. Hard cheeses include cheddar and parmesan, soft cheeses are mozzarella (often used on pizza) and feta. Lactose intolerance usually gets worse as you get older, and a small amount of milk consumed typically won\u2019t trigger lactose intolerance.\n\nA dairy allergy will NOT be helped by lactaid. It will not matter what kind of dairy you have. It\u2019s all dairy. Because you are allergic to the *proteins* in dairy, the lactose content is essentially meaningless. A lot of children are born with dairy allergies, actually, and outgrow it as they get older. A small amount of dairy absolutely can trigger a severe dairy allergy.

But she has crazy vertical and she\u2019s who I think of when judging shorter people with vertical. i think it just makes sense to think \u201cshorter the person = the less likely to be the three taller types\u201d even though it\u2019s 100% a shortcut that is NOT fullproof. it\u2019s a generalization the way people assume romantics are curvy/have noticeable hips and bust. it\u2019s not accurate though. \n\ni do think the IDs like SC and SN are misconstrued as taller than gamine which is completely not true \u2014 their height limit is the same or an inch taller. that genuinely does bother me.  i think people really misunderstand balance, maybe because there\u2019s so few verified classics in mainstream pop culture. edit: i will also cop, as a 4\u201910\u201d SN, that i used to feel a little bitter that i don\u2019t get to be in the \u201cpetite\u201d family and i wonder if other people are also experiencing some type resistance there and projecting as a result.   \n\ni will also add \u2014 and i disagree but i thought i\u2019d mention it \u2014 that a lot of people do want minimum height limits. partially because it makes finding an ID easier for shorter people (if you\u2019re under 5\u20194\u201d, like about 50% of American women, then you can technically be any ID) and partially because it seems to make logical sense. why can you be too tall for an ID and not too short? like i said, i disagree, but i understand why people feel this way.", "created_utc": "1665802016.0", "edited": "1665802263.0", "id": "isdexb5", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_y4adrc", "parent_id": "t3_y4adrc", "score": "51", "subreddit": "Kibbe", "subreddit_id": "t5_22m7gw"}, {"author": "angorarabbbbits", "body": "specifically female is weird but in the US a generic disclaimer about \u201cdiverse\u201d applicants that specifies people of color, LGBT, disabled people etc. is pretty common. it reads as a lazy, tacked on version of that.", "created_utc": "1665795635.0", "edited": "False", "id": "isd23t5", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_y3vuvf", "parent_id": "t1_isbdzs3", "score": "19", "subreddit": "recruitinghell", "subreddit_id": "t5_3bwcw"}, {"author": "angorarabbbbits", "body": "i think he\u2019s definitely gotten worse. unmedicated psychosis only gets worse, in a way distinct from other mental illnesses, and it also often degrades your intelligence. she probably did overlook a lot though. \n\na study about this: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5743746/", "created_utc": "1665795392.0", "edited": "False", "id": "isd1luw", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_y3tay3", "parent_id": "t1_isczmgp", "score": "12", "subreddit": "KUWTK", "subreddit_id": "t5_2uw6o"}, {"author": "angorarabbbbits", "body": "yup. he\u2019s pushed everyone away. if he made true amends i think a lot of them would return to support him privately but he\u2019s far away from doing that.", "created_utc": "1665795073.0", "edited": "False", "id": "isd0yg3", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_y3tay3", "parent_id": "t1_isczk36", "score": "7", "subreddit": "KUWTK", "subreddit_id": "t5_2uw6o"}, {"author": "angorarabbbbits", "body": "i\u2019m a big fan of \u201ci\u2019m gay, i\u2019m broke as shit\u201d from his presidential ad or whatever it was", "created_utc": "1665794549.0", "edited": "False", "id": "isczv78", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_y46aej", "parent_id": "t1_isckmra", "score": "84", "subreddit": "popculturechat", "subreddit_id": "t5_5rj68d"}, {"author": "angorarabbbbits", "body": "whitney houston had some iconic shady quotes.", "created_utc": "1665794460.0", "edited": "False", "id": "isczoly", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_y46aej", "parent_id": "t1_isckux3", "score": "43", "subreddit": "popculturechat", "subreddit_id": "t5_5rj68d"}, {"author": "angorarabbbbits", "body": "I think he consumes a lot of pop music and NYC theatre.

Parasocial is anything from listening to a podcast and feeling like you\u2019re with friends to stalking a celebrity because you\u2019re angry at who they chose to date. It doesn\u2019t have to be an active belief, but a subconscious feeling that shapes your reactions. The bad side of Parasocial is believing you\u2019re friends with someone, then demanding a closer relationship than they would likely have in real life. Believing you deserve all information, asserting your right to give input on their actions. Parasocial relationships don\u2019t have boundaries, because it\u2019s a million vs 1. Think of a relative who\u2019s nosy and opinionated about everything you do \u2014 except a million of them.\n\nIt\u2019s not inherently parasocial to care about this. Even if it was, that\u2019s not a bad thing. Entertainment is built on parasocial relationships. But some resulting behavior absolutely is bad. I think *entitlement* is the key here.

They feel that they deserve to know everything that happened between Ned and Alex, timelines and all. There\u2019s a difference in expectation between *curiosity* and *entitlement*.

If you didn\u2019t care about his marriage you had no reason to buy any of his content. I believe most articles being written are trying to make that angle \u2014 he ruined himself.

Or how about \"Sub Saharan Africa is dangerously patriarchal and often polygamic.\" All 46 countries? This isn't scientific language. It's, sort of, a piece of feminist theory. (A bad one.) There is no citations on the prevalence of infidelity in abusive relationships, the rates of PTSD -- merely, \"this is what happens and this is what that means.\" All of the citations are books about feminist theory, none on psychology. They're probably very interesting reads, but not super useful here. interestingly, the author works for Viterbo University -- a Catholic university. We'll get back to that, remember it!\n\nthe second is a psychologytoday article, a site which is infamous for not only being poorly researched, but edited after the fact. i had several PhDs tell me in school i would get zero credit for using it as a source. there is a seriously good chance Weiss did not write what we read today. regardless, he does not say cheating is abuse. he actually always qualifies what he says with words like \"sometimes\" and \"often.\" It's mostly the tactics used by abusers who cheat, rather than proving that cheaters are abusers.\n\nthe third has neither an author nor any qualifications. it's a Christian organization designed to raise awareness for violence against women. It seems to be a good organization, but given that cheating is a sin, that will slant its view. Very interesting how OP found two Christian sources -- one from a pro-life university, oh no! -- and refuses to understand why I'm a little cynical about them. I wonder if this is why OP is very hesitant to engage my comment about women in abusive relationships cheating and DARVO. \n\nhere's the thing: peer review exists to lend credibility. a scientific paper doesn't have to be making a new argument. it can be replication or a summary of old results. but peer review ensures things sentences like \"Sub Saharan Africa is dangerously patriarchal and often polygamic\" don't happen.\n\nbut like i said, OP is probably a troll so this mostly for anyone reading the carnage. bye!", "created_utc": "1665005125.0", "edited": "1665008794.0", "id": "ir7ccpn", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_xwddz2", "parent_id": "t1_ir7bdos", "score": "17", "subreddit": "TheTryGuys", "subreddit_id": "t5_m1ld2"}, {"author": "angorarabbbbits", "body": "The situation you're giving is gaslighting, yes.

viral post about how many serial killers are geminis. it doesn't mean anything and i've learned to ignore it. \n\n\"evil\" is difficult to define. a lot of people don't even believe true evil exists. aspects associated with evil are more along the lines of \"this predicts consistent conflict/transformation.\" pluto aspects are sometimes stereotyped as evil. \n\nthat said, \"rude\" and \"no empathy\" are a bit more precise -- some libra placements are known to be invested in making sure all voices are heard, which can lead to voicing contrarian or devil's advocate-type opinions. that can come across as rude. libra placements are sometimes interested in social harmony -- they want to form connections,  keep the peace, and they're good at it. that said, i think \"keeping the peace\" can involve difficult decisions in reconciling differences. that's one of libra's downfalls -- indecision. the style, nature, environment, and reaction involved depends on surrounding factors of the libra placement. aspects, house, transits. \n\nthat said, this sounds less about libras and more about *you*. without a full natal chart it's impossible to say what exactly your problems are with the libras

This show is 100% not really a comedy like NFY and I don't think I'll rewatch it like I do NFY. \n\nI don't think it's \\*literally\\* serial killer though. With NFY, the general discussion was that his character was more on the spectrum/autistic. I think his character here has this severe guilt and anxiety over life, to the degree he has to \"rehearse\" everything compulsively. It's deliberately paralleling a lot of anxiety issues -- social anxiety leading people to rehearse social situations, agoraphobics afraid to leave safety and take risks, people with OCD and compulsions. I think it's taking a lot of this and heightening it 10x and showing how well-meaning people in creative positions can exert a ton of power abuse even though, to them, they're struggling too.
