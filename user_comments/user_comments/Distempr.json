My personal experience comes from listening to Russian music at first, at which point I started to get interested in the language.

From there, I continued to listen to music, from which I learned a large amount of vocabulary. Because I was interested in it and listened to it so much, it helped me learn basic patterns.\n\nThe problem I eventually came across is the fact that the spoken language is very very different from what you come across in songs. I didn't immerse myself that much in listening to \"pure\" Russian so it's left a fairly large gap, which I'm trying to improve by watching movies/TV shows or listening to radio talk shows.\n\nI stopped for a little while and forgot a fair amount of words so I'm \"refilling\" that gap by using Lingvist. I'm considering looking at other sources such as FluentU, as well as taking lessons with native speakers on iTalki and Verbling. This depends on how much money you want to and are able to throw at learning. It's possible to learn without spending money if that's your goal, but requires a lot of passion, unless you happen to have a natural gift at learning languages.\n\nSorry for the rant, but as I said it depends a lot on what's best for you so I'm only trying to add context to your journey, and if you have any questions I or the rest of the community will be happy to help! :)", "created_utc": "1596684465.0", "edited": "False", "id": "g0isjjp", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_i410us", "parent_id": "t3_i410us", "score": "2", "subreddit": "LearnRussian", "subreddit_id": "t5_2y6lb"}, {"author": "Distempr", "body": "\u0421\u043f\u0430\u0441\u0438\u0431\u043e \u0437\u0430 \u043e\u0431\u044a\u044f\u0441\u043d\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435)", "created_utc": "1596405775.0", "edited": "False", "id": "g05b9bz", "is_submitter": "True", "link_id": "t3_i27kmh", "parent_id": "t1_g036435", "score": "2", "subreddit": "LearnRussian", "subreddit_id": "t5_2y6lb"}, {"author": "Distempr", "body": "Install scripts are frowned upon because they aren't supported by the community, and I'm sure most people on the sub will say that you should only be using the install guide on the wiki.\n\nAs for other Arch-based OS's, there are other subs for these distros, such as /r/EndeavourOS for your specific choice, so I'm sure most people here will be a bit biased and say that Arch does everything they need and that they don't see the point in going for a derivative.
