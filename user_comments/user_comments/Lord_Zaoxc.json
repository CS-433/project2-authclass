There's so many words that people use for the concept between \"dialect\" and \"regional language\": \u65b9\u8a00\u3001\u5f53\u5730\u8bdd\u3001\u571f\u8bdd\u3001\u8bdd\u3001\u8bed\u3001\u672c\u571f\u8bdd\u3001\u5bb6\u4e61\u8bdd. Then there's like this one that's all incompassing\uff1a\u4e2d\u56fd\u8bdd. I've always felt like that one was the most equalizing among all the ways of saying it, but each one has a different connotation to it.", "created_utc": "1659197633.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ii9szt9", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_wbzt7t", "parent_id": "t1_ii9pwug", "score": "4", "subreddit": "ChineseLanguage", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qyz1"}, {"author": "Lord_Zaoxc", "body": "Yes.

It could also be a morphological rule depending on the phological context. However, negative transfer from people's native regional languages tends to also make the picture hazy.

I've been learning for 11 years now and pretty much recognize every character in every book I pick up. Now, I'm just correcting some little mistakes that got loose over the years. For instance, just the other day I realized that \u5e06 is \"fan1\" and not \"fan2\". I've always read it as second tone because I assumed it was read the same as \u51e1\u3002Or even Chinese wife used to think that \u8377\u5170 was pronounced \"he4 lan2\" and not \"he2 lan2\". So, the thing about looking at the radicals for pronouciation can be deceiving a lot of times, but can come in handy in a pinch. \n\nBut to be honest, a lot of Chinese folks have these kinds of problems as well, especially since there's like a different accent for every city in China basically. I've seen northerners and southerners have problems communicating just because of southerners generally not using neutral tones for anything. For instance, words like \u5934\u53d1 that's pronounced tou2 fa in the north are pronounced as tou2 fa4 in the south mostly. Or even a word like \u719f in the north is pronounced \"shu2\" and in the south it's usually \"shou2\". This makes it super frustrating from a learner's prespective, but like I said, even Chinese people don't understand each other sometimes because of what some people from different regions see as \"tiny differences\". My wife comes from a place where they don't make a differenitiation between /l/ and /n/. They just do a nasalized /l/ for both. I remember just recently we were talking to a Taiwanese friend , and my wife said the word \u8001\u5e08 in her accent, and my Taiwanese friend had to ask me what \u8111\u5e08 meant.  \n\nI digress. Bottom line is you really just have learn by coming in contact with the language and looking up every single character you feel a bit skeptical of. I, personally, don't do it all the time because it's tiring af, but listening carefully to how people with your target accent pronounce characters and looking up the pinyin is a good combination of tactics.", "created_utc": "1656342449.0", "edited": "False", "id": "idxr1y9", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_vlwrp6", "parent_id": "t3_vlwrp6", "score": "11", "subreddit": "ChineseLanguage", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qyz1"}, {"author": "Lord_Zaoxc", "body": "\u6211\u5c31\u662f\u73a9\u4efb\u5929\u5802\u6e38\u620f\u957f\u5927\uff0c\u5176\u4ed6\u6e38\u620f\u673a\u518d\u597d\uff0c\u4e5f\u8fbe\u4e0d\u5230\u73a9\u4efb\u5929\u5802\u7684\u90a3\u79cd\u4eb2\u5207\u611f", "created_utc": "1656255966.0", "edited": "False", "id": "idta7c2", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_vl0kh6", "parent_id": "t3_vl0kh6", "score": "1", "subreddit": "Taiwanese", "subreddit_id": "t5_5y0yzu"}, {"author": "Lord_Zaoxc", "body": "I like [this one](https://www.amazon.com/-/es/Julio-Sagreras/dp/0786627239/ref=pd_lpo_1?pd_rd_i=0786627239&psc=1).

From my own studies of languages and teaching children and adults English, Chinese, and music, I've seen that adults tend to be more efficient language learners when you give them the right tools of study, but children tend to need to setup a nurturing environment that makes them feel like they NEED and WANT the language. They also tend to be very adverse to learning that isn't just complete immersion with something fun to do. \n\nI'm very much in agreement with what Luca says in [this](https://youtu.be/CWuGZidj76U) video. I think we neglect exactly how long and under what conditions it takes for children to learn their mother tongue. Plus, I always hear people in child development talk about the \"Critical Period\", but I find it interesting that all of the people that I've met who talk about this have never learned a foreign language themselves or have just learned English out of complete necessity and pretty much have just accepted the state of their grammar and accent in the language. I have found a lot of outliers to the \"Critical Period\" theory. I have friends who came to the States as older adolescents (around 16+), who have learned English with an indistinguishable American accent, and, if they would have never told you that they lived in another country for their first 16+ years on this Earth, you wouldn't have been able to tell. On the flip side, I've also met a lot of people who grew up speaking a language at home with their family, but when they speak it, they tend to have a very thick American accent and use a very \"English\" logic to speak. I feel like there's a lot of holes in the \"Critical Period\" theory and that it's mostly rooted in a complete global failure in language education rather than an physiological problem. \n\nI'm not completely against teaching a language as early as possible. I think that it's best if we teach as early as possible just so we don't have to learn a language while also dealing with the plethora of errands in everyday life. I think the state of foreign language education around the world has made it difficult to actually pinpoint the mechanism of learning in general without getting caught-up in \"folk science\". To me, what really matters is how open someone is to new concepts, the amount of time they come in contact with the language, and the ability to let oneself essentialy be a complete idiot without the stigma of being so. Children just so happen to tick-off all the requirements. Plus, the people in the world around them don't usually abash them for making any mistakes, so they tend to learn language without obstruction. Adults on the other hand, have the tendency to shame others AND themselves when they make mistakes of any kind. That environment and attitude is not conducive to learning and is probably the reason a lot of adults just quit learning after they get out of school. It seems to me adults are just too obsessed with being \"correct\" all the time. \n\nThe last thing I want to add from my own experiences is that accent is almost like \"mouth yoga\". It's just we can't see the inside of our throats, noses, and mouths as well as, let's say, our arms and legs, so if an adult can learn to retrain their body with new movements like in yoga and physical therapy, then I think the muscles that we use for language production should be seen in a similar light. Considering this, I've found that even the theory that children are at least better at accent may be untrue as well. It's just our methodology needs to be updated. I've also heard that just in the last few decades we've just now been able to develop the technology to observe the language production muscles in action, so maybe that's also a reason for the lag in corresponding methodology. \n\nSo, with all this being said, do you believe the language learning of children and adults work off of different mechanisms?", "created_utc": "1655475119.0", "edited": "False", "id": "icpmesf", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_veb16o", "parent_id": "t3_veb16o", "score": "5", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "Lord_Zaoxc", "body": "\u4e00\u76f4\u6709\u5fc3\u601d\u770b\u300a\u73b2\u97f3\u300b\uff0c\u6211\u51e0\u5e74\u524d\u770b\u4e86\u7b2c\u4e00\u96c6\u89c9\u5f97\u5f88\u50cf\u300a\u590f\u65e5\u5927\u4f5c\u6218\u300b\uff0c\u5c31\u662f\u589e\u6dfb\u4e86\u5f88\u591a\u9634\u68ee\u7684\u56e0\u7d20\u3002\u6211\u53ea\u662f\u89c9\u5f97\u75ab\u60c5\u7206\u53d1\u4e86\u4ee5\u540e\u90fd\u4e0d\u60f3\u770b\u8fd9\u79cd\u4ee4\u4eba\u6cae\u4e27\u7684\u7cfb\u5217\u2026\u2026", "created_utc": "1655437733.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ico2trp", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_vdysyt", "parent_id": "t3_vdysyt", "score": "3", "subreddit": "China_irl", "subreddit_id": "t5_x72uq"}, {"author": "Lord_Zaoxc", "body": "\u636e\u8bf4\u5eb5\u91ce\u79c0\u660e\u65b0\u5f00\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u5ba4\u8981\u53cd\u6297\u8fd9\u4e2a\u5546\u54c1\u5316\u7684\u6f6e\u6d41\uff0c\u5236\u4f5c\u65b0\u4e16\u7eaa\u798f\u97f3\u6218\u58eb\u7684\u56db\u90e8\u65b0\u5267\u573a\u7684\u539f\u56e0\u5c31\u662f\u4e3a\u4e86\u79ef\u6512\u8d44\u91d1\u800c\u62cd\u7684\uff0c\u540e\u7eed\u90fd\u8981\u5236\u9020\u66f4\u52a0\u6587\u827a\u4e00\u4e9b\u7684\u4f5c\u54c1", "created_utc": "1655437335.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ico225i", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_vdysyt", "parent_id": "t1_icnoqlf", "score": "3", "subreddit": "China_irl", "subreddit_id": "t5_x72uq"}, {"author": "Lord_Zaoxc", "body": "\u6211\u5c0f\u65f6\u5019\u5f88\u5bb3\u6015\u5bab\u5d0e\u9a8f\u52a8\u753b\u7247\u91cc\u9762\u7684\u753b\u9762\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u300a\u98ce\u4e4b\u8c37\u300b\u548c\u300a\u5e7d\u7075\u516c\u4e3b\u300b\u2026\u2026", "created_utc": "1655436940.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ico1915", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_vdysyt", "parent_id": "t1_icnidcl", "score": "2", "subreddit": "China_irl", "subreddit_id": "t5_x72uq"}, {"author": "Lord_Zaoxc", "body": "I don\u2019t really struggle with either anymore.

I learned it because my wife is from that area, so I learned it purely from talking to people (mainly my wife) and keeping a record of new words in a notebook (that unfortunately I left in China). I made a romanization system for it, printed out a list of characters with all possible syllables in Mandarin Chinese to figure out the gist of how the sounds of the characters converted into Chibinese, and then I just talked with my wife, our family, and her friends in it every time we when went back to the village. \n\nI kind of learned it out of necessity since absolutely nobody speaks Mandarin when they go back to the village, even though the vast majority can speak Mandarin.

He's pretty straightforward. It's about attitude and lots of reading and listening really. \n\n**Benny Lewis** \\- I know his whole *Fluent in 3 Months* spiel rubs people the wrong way, but his message about just getting out there using the language showing warts and all really encouraged me to take the first steps in communicating the languages I know. \n\n**Moses McCormick (R.I.P)** \\- To be honest, I never liked Moses' thing about learning so many languages (I think like 50+), but what I got from him was similar to Benny: just go out there and use it. \n\n**Kato Lomb** \\- I read her book about 5 years ago. One quote stood out to me: \"Language is the only thing worth learning even poorly\". Suddenly, I found beauty in my stupid mouth muscles lol. \n\n**Stewart Jay Ray** \\- I always admired him because he knows a lot of Asian languages, particularly Southeast Asian languages very well. I also remember the story of him finding Danish people to learn Danish from in Australia by looking for Danish people in the phonebook. I mean, a bit out there, but he found someone delighted to speak to him in Danish. \n\n**Richard Simcott** \\- He's just such a gentle soul. He taught me how to react to people responding in English. Just his gusto for languages is magnetic. \n\n**Luca Lampriello** \\- I was always impressed particularly by him with his accents. \n\n**Lindie Botes** \\- She's so open about her struggles. I love it. It makes the vocation more real. Actually, a lot of these polyglots openly talk about their struggles. That's one of the main traits I look for in someone to follow. The main thing I got from Lindie is how to incorporate language learning into everyday life: putting your phone in the target language, making presentations, etc. \n\n**Stefano (linguaEpassione)** \\- This guy is such a sweetheart. He has such a small following for such amazing linguistic feats. One thing that always impresses me is when a polyglot speaks languages very well that are outside of a body of related languages like Arabic and Korean, or Russian and Thai. He knows Finnish and Japanese, and apparently, out of all the polyglots I've seen online, his Finnish seems to be the most convincing. I think he's got to be one of my favorites. \n\n**Ollie Richards** \\- Yes, I know. He's selling his books and courses and whatnot, but I still really enjoy his interviews with a lot of language learners that would have been kind of under the radar if he wouldn't have put those videos out. I also really like his short story books for intermediate material. They've really helped me with Spanish, Portuguese, and Swedish! I just wish he wouldn't just like... copy and paste the material? lol (I feel this way about the mini stories on LingQ as well) \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'll also something about Xiaomanyc. I've always seen him as a bit annoying, but at the end of the day, he's putting smiles on people's faces and actually inspiring people to go out and learn. I know of at least one person I know that started learning Chinese because of him, so, yah, the whole \"white dude speaks perfect Chinese\" thing is a bit annoying, but he knows that, and is trying to get those sweet, sweet views. \n\nBottom line, a lot of these people are trying to sell their products, but I think they're just trying to live off of what they love.  I know there are some scandals (like I think there was something going on with Matt Vs. Japan?), but I think that happens in most communities... (not that we should ignore it though). I'm more of a \u4e09\u4eba\u884c\u5fc5\u6709\u6211\u5e08\u7109 kind of person (Rough Translation: Out of three people walking with me there is always someone who can be my teacher).

But there was one book I read way back when I had only learned for 3 or 4 years called \u300a\u9ec4\u91d1\u65f6\u4ee3\u300bby \u738b\u5c0f\u6ce2 that was okay, I'm still not really into realist stuff even though Chinese people pretty much see you as uneducated if you don't read the classics lol. Speaking of the classics, one thing I did that I found fruitful is reading the \u56db\u5927\u540d\u8457 in a simplified and modernized edition. Those were pretty good, I still love Journey to the West so much. I've been reading the original version lately of and on, and I gotta say, I really love the original. \n\nAs for Sci-Fi, which is the main genre I can recommend, \u5218\u6148\u6b23 is of course the big guy, I suppose you could go everyone else's route and read \u4e09\u4f53, but to be honest, I didn't really enjoy it that much. I actually liked \u300a\u7403\u72b6\u95ea\u7535\u300ba lot better. What I like the most by \u5218\u6148\u6b23 was his short stories. Some of my favorite short stories by him are: \u300a\u671d\u95fb\u9053\u300b\uff0c \u300a\u68a6\u4e4b\u6d77\u300b\uff0c\u300a\u5c71\u300b, and \u300a\u8bd7\u4e91\u300b. It's interesting to see \u5218\u6148\u6b23's interpretation of what the \"sublime\" is. I still have a master's thesis I need to write on him lol (in Chinese of course). \n\nFor other Sci-Fi writers there's also \u9648\u6978\u5e06\u3002He made a novel called \u300a\u8352\u6f6e\u300babout people in severely polluted slums that mutate with the technology junk around them to become a superhuman race of cyborgs and take over. The only thing I don't like about \u9648\u6978\u5e06 is that the language he uses tends to be very \"Anglofied\". Sometimes it sounds like a direct translation from English in (like \u9ebb\u70e6\u5236\u9020\u8005 for \"troublemaker\", who would actually say that? lol). One thing I DO enjoy about \u9648\u6978\u5e06 is that he uses a lot of Cantonese words in that book. Most Chinese people outside of Guangdong wouldn't know what \u201c\u95f4\u4e2d\u201d means, for instance. He also has a nice collection of translated short stories call \u300a\u5341\u4e8c\u4e2a\u660e\u5929\u300b(from English, but there's a couple of Chinese ones in there I think, definitely one by \u5218\u6148\u6b23).  \n\n\u97e9\u677e has to be one of my favorite Chinese Sci-Fi writers just because of how poetic his language sounds. I have yet to go through an entire book by him, but all the bits I've read of \u300a\u5730\u94c1\u300b and \u300a\u9ad8\u94c1\u300bhave been superb. He's got a nice slightly \"Lovecraftian\" kind of writing. It's always one of those situations where the protagonist gets thrown into a random supernatural situation that seems completely out of there power to stop. They all seems to have that same \u7edd\u671b (forgot how to say that in English lol) that Lovecraft's stories have. I also think that \u97e9\u677e's language in his stories are a much better way to use the Chinese language to write Sci-Fi. Others tend to Anglicize their language too much, which makes me feel like it's losing the innate charm of the Chinese language. \n\n\u90dd\u666f\u82b3 is also good Sci-Fi author! She won a Hugo award a few years ago for \u300a\u5317\u4eac\u6298\u53e0\u300b\u3002That was certainly a good read! I read through both her volumns of short stories. Though I still think \u5218\u6148\u6b23's writing is a bit better, she's also got some interesting stories. I remember one was about a disease that turns people into stone when they start to feel hopeless about life lol. \n\nI could go on forever it seems! lol I thought I wouldn't be able to remember a lot, but apparently it's still there in my brain!\n\nLast thing I would recommend, read translations of books you want to read, usually the language is a bit simpler than books made be native speakers. Me my self I've read \"The Girl with Dragon Tattoo\", \"The Hobbit\", \"The Alchemist\", two books by \"Thich Naht Hahn (is that how you spell his name?), and a bunch of others in Chinese. My entire bookcase of Chinese books are all in China right now, so I can't remember all of them lol. \n\nBut, that's all I'm going to say for now, because I need to start my day haha. My English (even though it's my mother tongue) gets all weird when I think about Chinese at the same time, so bear with me on that lol.

The \"hold over\" grace notes were a super cool touch.  Also, one of my favorite things you did was where the overlap between all the hemiola layers got complicated; you added the subdivisions above it. That makes it so much easier to count and feel those parts!

Is it in duples or triples? If duples, then it would be 3/4. If triples, it would be 9/8. As for the repeating of every 3 bars, that's just phrasing differences. That has nothing to do with the time signature unless the phrase makes more sense in something like 6/4 or 18/8 (especially if you want to be a prog rock band). \n\nAlso, just to point it for fun, 3/3 does exist! It would be a bar of 3 beats where a single half note triple gets the beat, but non-dyadic time signatures (meaning the bottom number not being a power of 2, ie 4/4, 3/4, 6/8, 5/8, 11/16 etc.) really only work if you have a different number of beats that don't fit in groups of 3 notes of equal triplet value and are juxtaposing it with other more \"normal\" time signatures. If you want to make a piece in 3/3, why not just make it in 4/4 with triplet half notes? An example I might use such a time signature would something like having a phrase of 5 half note triplets, so a bar of 4/4 followed by a bar of 2/3. Or even better, get some more \"disjunctness\" by throwing other time signatures in there, like 4/4 then 2/3 then 5/8.
