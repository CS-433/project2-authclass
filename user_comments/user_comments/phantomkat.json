I know it\u2019s scary, but once you get into a routine you\u2019ll feel more in control. Here are some tips from an elementary teacher:\n\n1) Don\u2019t give empty threats. If you warn a student he\u2019ll lose x amount of free time for not completing an assignment, follow through when he doesn\u2019t finish the assignment. Don\u2019t cave to the \u201cit was only one time\u201d or \u201cbut so and so didn\u2019t finish either!\u201d The moment you don\u2019t follow through is the moment your students know they can walk all over you.\n\n2) Document, document, document student behavior. If x student teases y student, document. If it happens again, document. If you don\u2019t document behavior and you only bring it up to a counselor or admin when it gets bad, they might dismiss you with a, \u201cLooks like it was only one time.\u201d Parents are also more likely to be on your side when they see a behavior is not an isolated incident.\n\n3) Create a Google Voice number to call parents.  Some families won\u2019t pick up if they see a school number. Some parents don\u2019t know how to use email. A Google Voice number allows you to call and text parents without giving out your actual number (NEVER give out your personal number.) I personally like to text parents because it creates a paper trail of the conversation. They\u2019re also more likely to answer a text than a phone call.\n\n4) Don\u2019t beat yourself up over students who don\u2019t want to learn. Sometimes you just have those students who don\u2019t want to do anything. They don\u2019t want to participate. They don\u2019t want to write. If you\u2019ve done all the prodding and encouraging you could then just leave it and document the student\u2019s behavior to bring it up to the parents.

So adding words like \u201cloca\u201d or \u201camigo\u201d at the end.  Personally I have never spoken like that to anybody. For example, I\u2019ve never said something like, \u201cI can\u2019t believe you just said that, pendejo.\u201d I would use an English equivalent of the word pendejo instead.\n\nThere\u2019s also the inaccuracy that translating random words in Spanish is something a character would do all the time. Like, \u201cI went to the casa yesterday to visit my family.\u201d Whenever I use Spanglish, the code switching is usually a bigger part of the sentence, like half of it. So I would mostly say, \u201cFui a la casa ayer para visitar mi familia, but nobody was home.\u201d I would also do this with other people who know Spanish, not someone who only knows English. Even little kids know this would confuse the listener.\n\nLooking at it from the other end, speakers don\u2019t normally insert random English words when speaking Spanish. At least for me, if I use an English word in an otherwise Spanish conversation it\u2019s because I don\u2019t know the word in Spanish (growing up in the US does that to you). So I would say something like, \u201cTengo que usar el strainer para la pasta,\u201d because I do not know the word for strainer in Spanish. Inaccuracy would be something like, \u201cTengo que usar el train,\u201d when I know the word for train Spanish. I\u2019m not saying someone wouldn\u2019t say the second sentence at all, but I do think it would be more rare than the first example.\n\nFor accuracy, you can always use words that are typically used in Spanglish. Some words are troca (truck), yarda (backyard), mopear (to mop), parquear (to park), carpeta (carpet), etc. Hell, my parents even heard the word signa (to sign) once. \n\nGrammatically there are also various examples you can use that have popped up in Spanglish. One example I frequently saw in my students is the usage of the possessive s in Spanish. So instead of hearing the correct, \u201cFui al cumplea\u00f1os de mi vecino.\u201d I heard, \u201cFui a mi vecino\u2019s cumplea\u00f1os.\u201d \n\nThere\u2019s also the grammar rule in Spanglish that if you use a noun in English and the article in Spanish the article has to match the gender the noun would have in Spanish. So hearing \u201cel spider\u201d is inaccurate while hearing \u201cla spider\u201d is correct.", "created_utc": "1656745528.0", "edited": "1656798291.0", "id": "iejuqkw", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_vpk3f9", "parent_id": "t3_vpk3f9", "score": "20", "subreddit": "FanFiction", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r5kb"}, {"author": "phantomkat", "body": "Currently planning a Daredevil/Pok\u00e9mon Mystery Dungeon one-shot.", "created_utc": "1656730087.0", "edited": "False", "id": "iej75p3", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_vpc89t", "parent_id": "t3_vpc89t", "score": "1", "subreddit": "FanFiction", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r5kb"}, {"author": "phantomkat", "body": "I think the reason it feels forced it\u2019s because it was teased from the very beginning, like the whole \u201cfake out make out\u201d fiascos.

Depending on the program you\u2019re following, you might have blocks of English time or where you review material in the opposite language with games and short lessons. \n\nThere are some things to keep in mind if you want to be a dual language teacher. \n\nFirst of all, most of dual language programs are in Title 1 schools due to the fact these programs aim to serve Spanish-native students. If you\u2019re end goal is to end up in a high performing school then being a dual language teacher is not for you. \n\nSecond, some of these programs have English-native speakers learning Spanish. These students have been, by far, the hardest part of the job. It is a challenge trying to get these students on grade level in Spanish when no Spanish is spoken outside of school with them. Some of these kids clearly do not want to be there, but their parents are adamant they stay there, even when shown their child cannot read at grade level in any language. \n\nThere are plenty of pros, though. You\u2019ll get a nifty stipend with your position. (My old Texas district is offering a $7,000 stipend.) You\u2019ll also enjoy the fact that you\u2019ll be high in demand in most areas and will more than likely get a job before summer ends. I also adore working with Hispanic parents and students. \n\nPM me if you would like to talk more in detail.", "created_utc": "1655843031.0", "edited": "False", "id": "id80ike", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_vg766e", "parent_id": "t3_vg766e", "score": "1", "subreddit": "teaching", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qyj9"}, {"author": "phantomkat", "body": "God, I can\u2019t choose between these two:\n\n\u201cBlind Spots and Polka Dots\u201d: a Daredevil/Miraculous Ladybug WIP.

I would definitely try and sit down with a teacher you know and discuss these areas so they can give their POV and experiences with these things.\n\n1) Data collection. University never prepared me to the high amount of data I would need to collect for every little thing. Reading assessments every six or nine weeks. Math benchmarks. Behavioral tracking for students (because otherwise, some admin won\u2019t even help you). Small group data for reading in math so you can track intervention. This is by far my weakest area in teaching. It\u2019s almost impossible to teach yet still do all this. \n\n2) Extra activities and performances you have to do as an elementary teacher. Look, I love a good ol\u2019 Christmas performance as much as the next teacher, but these events are just one more thing you have to fit to your teaching schedule. I have awesome memories of kids dancing or singing on stage, but it came with the added stress of moving teaching time around. Many of these things will require you to stay after school. Since you\u2019ll have a kid, it\u2019ll be that much more challenging moving your after school schedule around. I\u2019ve had to stay at events until 8 or 9pm, then wake up at 5am for work. Admin didn\u2019t care what you had going after school. \n\n3) Parents. I\u2019m sure you have a lot of experience with parents and how fun they can be (/s), but there\u2019s a just a special breed of parents that come out of hiding when it\u2019s about grades and honor roll. Some parents will talk to you until they are blue in the face about why their child deserve those missing points on a test.

You always have to keep in mind things like, \"Okay, we're going to lunch, but A can't sit next to B because they start to fight, and C plays with his food all the time.\"\n* Parents can be a bitch. If you get one of THOSE parents they can make your year Hell.\n* Likewise, students can be assholes. I've had kids who can't make eye contact with each other or they would fight. I've had kids spoiled rotten and would frequently throw tantrums. \n* There's always the guilt of bending over backwards \"for the kids\". Stay after school and do this. Spent your own money for x. If you don't set hard boundaries, this can wear you down.", "created_utc": "1647902575.0", "edited": "False", "id": "i1l9g9q", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_tjj3pi", "parent_id": "t3_tjj3pi", "score": "4", "subreddit": "Teachers", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qqcs"}, {"author": "phantomkat", "body": "I once had a principal dock me points because while the lesson went fine it didn't really \"showcase how I could teach\".

Elementary teaching can be notorious to try and wreck your work/life balance because some people think little kids = bend over backwards for them. Here are some tips I keep in mind that  you could communicate to your wife:\n\n* Work hard during your planning period so you're not tempted to work at home. \n* Leave the school the moment you're contract says you're able to. If your grade level team wants to plan/go over curriculum then that can be done during their planning period. \n* Don't volunteer for stuff. As an elementary teacher, you're already going to do a bunch of other cutesy things that are not teaching.\n\nOf course, as your wife continues to teach, she may move some things around. For example, I best lesson plan at home with Netflix on the background on a Sunday night. Grading is best done at school.
