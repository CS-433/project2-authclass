A little intro, then some iteration of verse+chorus a number of times, maybe a solo or bridge, then an outro at times. \n\nIt's easy to miss that in the app as it all just simply scrolls by as you read it. \n\nThe analogy might be the difference between reading a page in a book vs memorizing a passage by heart.  If you want to jam by the campfire or what-not, you can't be pulling up your app or even paper/digital tablature frankly. It will have to memorized.\n\nI sometimes print out a set of chords+lyrics for a song already in Yousician, tape it to the wall, and then just play the song (and maybe sing along). You can even start the song in Yousician and, looking only at your print out, silver star them while never looking at your app. Sometimes I just queue up a song on Spotify and try to keep up with the rhythm.\n\nMy personal goal for a song is to be able to play and sing it with my eyes closed.\n\nAnother thing is exploring music theory, which is basically absent from the app, which /u/KeyResponsibility366 explains in their comment. Understanding how chords are constructed and why they are named as such requires knowing how scales are constructed (at the very least Major and Minor scales). Which also gives insight into how chord progressions fit together in a way that sounds pleasing.\n\nI am just now refreshing myself to some of this concepts after years off.

For reasons that remain unclear, Syrian government troops and some Russian nationals appear to have attacked a coalition position, near Al Tabiyeh, Syria.\n\nThe attack occurred in the vicinity of Deir al-Zour, a strategic, oil-rich territory that is coveted by the Syrians. Most of the fatalities were attributed to an American airstrike on enemy columns that was called in by American-backed Kurdish soldiers who believed they were under attack.\n\nAt no point, an American military spokesman said, was there any chance of direct conflict between United States and Russian forces.\n\n\u201cCoalition officials were in regular communication with Russian counterparts before, during and after the thwarted, unprovoked attack,\u201d according to Col. Ryan S. Dillon, a spokesman for the American military. \u201cRussian officials assured coalition officials they would not engage coalition forces in the vicinity.\u201d\n\nThe Kremlin \u2014 seeking to play down its involvement in the fighting in Syria and seemingly hoping to avoid escalating tensions with the United States \u2014 has sidestepped questions about the episode, even as it faces rare criticism at home over its failure to acknowledge the deaths of Russians in Syria.\n\nIt has stressed repeatedly since last Wednesday that no members of the Russian armed forces were killed, and that any Russians fighting alongside the Syrians were mercenaries.\n\n\u201cWe only handle the data that concerns Russian forces servicemen,\u201d Dmitri S. Peskov, the Kremlin spokesman, said at a news briefing on Tuesday. \u201cWe don\u2019t have data about other Russians who could be in Syria.\u201d\n\nThe Kremlin said much the same about the nature of the forces in Crimea and eastern Ukraine in 2014, however, claiming they were volunteers and men on vacation, only to admit later that they were regular soldiers.\n\n\nPresident Vladimir V. Putin has said at least three times since 2016 that combat operations in Syria were winding down, including once during a surprise visit to a Russian air base in Syria last December. Yet there are hundreds if not thousands of contract soldiers in Syria whom the Russian government has never acknowledged.\n\nThey were deployed both to help keep the official cost down and to avoid reports of casualties, especially with a March presidential election in Russia fast approaching. Even though the Kremlin enacted a law during the Ukraine crisis in 2015 to make battlefield casualties a secret, the funerals for regular soldiers killed in combat need to be more official than those for mercenaries, and are thus difficult to hide.\n\nAnd some individual Russians have begun speaking out. Aleksandr Ionov, a Russian businessman working in Syria offering security and other services, said he estimated after conversations with associates in several private military organizations that more than 200 Russians might have been killed.\n\nMr. Ionov said not all those killed were Russian: Some of the paid fighters came from other countries that were once part of the Soviet Union. \u201cMore than 200 is the current estimate, we cannot know the exact number yet, but most of them were Russian,\u201d he said in a telephone interview.\n\nMr. Ionov said he was speaking out because he wanted any Russians who were killed to be officially recognized for their sacrifice.\n\n\n\u201cThe truth has to be told,\u201d he said. \u201cIf people died, then this should be recognized and respects should be paid to people who fought against terrorists.\u201d\n\nHe called on the government to give a fuller version of events, adding, \u201cPeople are outraged because they want to know the truth.\u201d\n\nMr. Ionov was not the only one speaking out about Russian fatalities. Aleksandr Averin, a member of the Other Russia nationalist party, confirmed that Kirill Ananiev, a party member who left for Syria about a year ago, had been killed in the airstrike, noting that there were other \u201csubstantial losses.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can confirm that Kirill died on Feb. 7 in Syria, near the Euphrates River, as a result of a strike by the American coalition,\u201d Mr. Averin said in an interview, adding that he was aware of \u201csubstantial losses\u201d suffered by \u201cparamilitary structures with ties to Russia.\u201d He refused to elaborate.\n\nAnother victim, Vladimir N. Loginov, 51, died \u201cin an unequal fight on Feb. 7 in the area of Syria\u2019s Deir al-Zour,\u201d according to a statement published online by his paramilitary organization.\n\n\u201cHe died, heroically defending our motherland in the far reaches against the invasion of maddened barbarians,\u201d the group, the Baltic Cossack Union in Kaliningrad, said in the statement.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know anything, whether they will bring them or not,\u201d said Mrs. Kocheva, 41, referring to the men\u2019s corpses. \u201cThis is very difficult and frightening.\u201d\n\nThe names of most of the victims identified so far were first reported by the Conflict Intelligence Team, a group of Russian investigative bloggers. The exact circumstances of their deaths could not be established by The New York Times.\n\nThe Russian Defense Ministry, which supports the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad, in the continuing civil war, said none of its servicemen had been involved in the clash and that only 25 pro-government Syrian insurgents were wounded. It took pains to distance itself from the battle.\n\n\u201cThe reason for the incident was lack of coordination between the reconnaissance movements of the Syrian insurgents and the Russian operative command,\u201d the ministry said in its statement on Thursday.\n\nThe number and exact nature of private Russian security firms operating in Syria is unclear, although there have been persistent reports in the Russian news media that some militiamen who fought on the side of the Russian-backed separatists in the war in eastern Ukraine later deployed to Syria.\n\nThe main Russian paramilitary contracting organization is the Wagner Group, known by the nickname of the retired Russian officer who leads it. The group has been operating in Syria in various capacities, including protecting some oil fields, according to multiple reports in the Russian news media. Its relationship with the Kremlin is murky and unconfirmed, but its leaders have reportedly received awards in the Kremlin and its mercenaries are trained at the Russian Defense Ministry\u2019s facilities.\n\nGrigory A. Yavlinsky, a veteran Russian opposition politician who is a candidate in next month\u2019s presidential election, called on Tuesday for Mr. Putin to disclose the number of Russians who had died in Syria.\n\n\u201cI demand an explanation as to why Russian nationals take part in ground military operations in Syria, despite the statements by the president and defense minister that Russian military formations will be withdrawn from this country,\u201d Mr. Yavlinsky said in a statement. \u201cI also think there needs to be a public report about relations with the U.S., as there is a growing threat of an accidental or deliberate direct military clash between Russia and America.\u201d\n\nThe official Kremlin stance is that its military deployment in Syria is now centered on two permanent bases, one for Russia\u2019s air force and one for its navy, there by invitation from the Syrian government.\n\nRussian political analysts said that the country\u2019s reluctance to confirm that its citizens had died as a result of a United States-led airstrike was actually a sign that Moscow did not want to further worsen the already fractured bilateral relations with Washington.\n\n\u201cThis is a very rare case, where the positions of Russia and the U.S. got closer,\u201d said Aleksei V. Makarkin, an analyst at the Center for Political Technologies, a think tank in Moscow. \u201cNo one wants to take steps that will do irreparable damage to the already broken Russia-U.S. relations.\u201d\n\n*Correction: Feb. 13, 2018\nBecause of an editing error, an earlier version of this article incorrectly described an account by a Syrian military officer.

Then later in the Reagan years they repurposed the way the money was given out to the states -- giving each state far more latitude in how that money was spent. And many of them did not even attempt to follow the previous model. \n\nIs that a parallel to how some states refuse to expand Medicaid under the federal dollars that came with the ACA?

Where people seem to talk more about silverware (\u201cthe fork, the knife\u201d) and what color things are more than any real person ever does and, having mastered these locutions, you get off the plane in a place where the language is spoken and can barely figure out how to say, \u201cHow do I get outside?\u201d\n\nPeople often ask me what the best ways of learning a language are without a classroom. And the truth is that a lot of ways most readily available will be fun and useful but won\u2019t give what they really want. Say you want to be able to connect with an in-law who doesn\u2019t speak English well or with people you supervise who don\u2019t or you just want to be able to enjoy films and TV shows in the language.\n\nIf so, lawyers and spoons aren\u2019t going to do the job. Neither actual people nor fictional ones are much given to discussing silverware or remarking on basic weather conditions (\u201cIt is raining\u201d), and \u201cMy name is \u2026\u201d is useful in an interaction with someone only one time. You need to be able to say and understand real things, such as \u201cHe didn\u2019t even know she was right in front of him\u201d and \u201cThat smells more like turkey than chicken\u201d and \u201cNo, you\u2019d better go around back.\u201d Those aren\u2019t idioms; they are the kinds of things you say all the time.\n\nPlus you need to be able to get past feeling that actual speakers of the language talk too fast. There are no spaces between words in spoken language, and sentences go by in a stream. But this is no more \u201ctoo fast\u201d than the sky is too blue. Humans don\u2019t express themselves in carefully paced nuggets of speech. To be able to handle a language means dealing with that reality.\n\nThe issue is the intermediate level. What do you do after you\u2019ve done a program that gets you started and takes you through the basic level, like Duolingo or Babbel (or my favorite, less known in the United States, Assimil)? You can take a class, but suppose you want to do it yourself? How do you get past \u201cMy cousin has a house\u201d and \u201cI see seven pens\u201d?\n\nI want to share my answer to that, because I have spent my life compulsively teaching myself to get around in languages \u2014 I have the polyglot disease \u2014 and I know of a way to get farther than people usually get. There is no reason that Glossika shouldn\u2019t be as well known as Duolingo and Babbel. It teaches you real language, and it gets you used to just hearing the language, rather than relying as much on text as sound. After all, there are no subtitles in real life.\n\nThe method is pretty simple. You get recordings of 5,000 sentences in the language of your choice. Glossika comes in more than 60 languages at this point: If you feel your life isn\u2019t complete without immersing yourself in some Slovenian or Uzbek, Glossika is for you. But the important part here is that the sentences are real ones. The first time I used it, the first sentence was about being good at tennis. Think: In a foreign language you know, were you ever taught how to say \u201cgood at\u201d? To speak a language is to know how to say things like that.\n\nI like to do about a half-hour a day when I\u2019m doing Glossika. More than that feels like labor, and then you fall off. You do a small bunch of sentences at a time \u2014 say, 15. You listen to the sentence as many times as you like, glean what it means and look at the written materials only as support if needed. Then you repeat the sentence. This is important: Saying the sentences not only helps with enunciating but also massively helps with retention. If you only listen to the material, it kind of goes right through you.\n\nThe key thing is what\u2019s called spaced repetition. The system gives you a sentence again later in your lesson and sprinkles it in with other sentences in later lessons. As time goes by, you cull the sentences that you\u2019ve had so often that you, as it were, know the drill. Also, no grammar lessons. You can study such things in the written materials if you want, but the idea is to pick up how the language works in a similar way to how we learn language as children \u2014 by just hearing it, all the time. So if you\u2019re not much for the \u201chablo, hablas, habla\u201d thing, you don\u2019t have to deal with that.\n\nGlossika isn\u2019t flashy. You don\u2019t get much by way of games (or \u201cgamification\u201d as one apparently says these days). Culture is not the point, either; it is assumed you will take in that kind of information elsewhere. Glossika is about doing the work. And do it for some months, getting in all the sentences \u2026 and one fine day, it\u2019s like going from the black and white to the color part of \u201cThe Wizard of Oz.\u201d\n\nSuddenly you can understand what native speakers are saying, because now the language is in your ear for real. I\u2019ll never forget the day I walked by some Chinese people and heard one of them saying in Mandarin, \u201cWait, take a picture of that statue,\u201d when just a few months earlier I would have heard nothing but a stream of sounds.\n\nThis, then, is the handiest way I know of to get past \u201cThat is my neighbor\u2019s pencil\u201d on your own. And by the way, no, I am not connected with the company in any way. I just want to share something really useful.\n\nGlossika includes some other activities to help you learn to write in the language and allow you to listen to yourself speak. I find those less important than just getting the language poured into my ear daily, with a kind of repetition that no actual human would be patient enough for \u2014 even for pay.\n\nI also want more people to know about Glossika because its creator, Michael Campbell, is a sterling citizen of the world\u2019s languages. Of the roughly 7,000 languages that are currently spoken, only about 500 or 600 may still be in use a hundred years from now. Globalization and urbanization focus people on speaking the big lingua francas, such that languages spoken by small Indigenous groups stop being passed on to children. Also, in countless cases in the past, Native Americans and Australian Aboriginals were discouraged from using their languages, with children physically abused in schools for doing so. There is now a language diversity crisis akin to the one facing so much of the world\u2019s flora and fauna.\n\nAs one response to this, Glossika helps you learn some struggling languages, such as Welsh and Taiwanese, free. Campbell is encouraging the last speakers of various Indigenous languages to record Glossika sets in their languages. The chance that many of these languages, such as Native American ones of the Pacific Northwest and indigenous ones of Taiwan, will survive as spoken languages is small. However, having them recorded in the Glossika format will be an invaluable way to at least preserve them for posterity.\n\nCampbell intends Glossika as a way to learn a language from the ground up. However, it\u2019s really a set for going intermediate. With all due respect for the platform, few adults are really up for piecing out how a language works by just jumping into idiomatic sentences without knowing any vocabulary or grammar at all, like babies.\n\nAlso, most people will want to check up on the grammar of a language more than the Glossika ideal assumes. Because the format uses the same 5,000 sentences for all of the languages, there are things that aren\u2019t drilled as much as they would be if the sentences were tailored for the language individually. In Spanish you\u2019ll want to see the masculine and feminine marking explained. In Japanese you\u2019ll need some explanation about which pronouns and verbs to use with whom and so on. But the general intensity of exposure you get to any of the languages is, in the grand scheme of things, invaluable.\n\nOverall, how do you learn a language beyond the basics? You start with things like Duolingo and Babbel (and Assimil!), and the next step is Glossika. After that, the next move is immersion with real people. After I did one set, a speaker told me, \u201cYou know a lot of words!\u201d That hedged but sincere compliment was dead on; I spoke roughly like a bright 4-year-old, and Glossika did that.\n\n____\n\nBasically he suggests some primers for beginning language learning - Duolingo, Babbel, Assimil - and then praises Glossika (but not without faults) for helping a beginner-intermediate speaker take the next step forward.\n\nIt would be good to hear others thoughts, as OP suggested.", "created_utc": "1631739682.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hczyi22", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_poy9sr", "parent_id": "t1_hczw464", "score": "14", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "chacamaschaca", "body": "Oh shit, it's a plot against us by Big Numbers!

As no one has answered yet, I'll give you a run down of how I came to grips with how to handle my fairly busy days.\n\nHave a good report sheet to get handoff with. A report sheet or method or getting report that you can write down all the things that will be relevant is rounds is important. Anything abnormal or unexpected in ROS, significant events overnight, specific patient concerns that they somehow never manage to bring up to they MD directly, and also your own concerns. Keep an eye out for what the ultimate plan for discharge is, or find out in rounds. I've notice my night shift crew are great at admissions, but they struggle with the nuts & bolts of discharges - where are they going, will they need oxygen, do they have all their new prescriptions, any other durable medical equipment, etc.\n\nFirst thing after handoff is to take a look at the EMR and get a handle on what time scheduled meds are for your patients including anticipating likely PRNs they may need/want. Try to cluster to your med times the best you can. Morning med pass can be hectic, as pts tend to have most of their daily meds due in the morning. Take a look at labs. If CNAs are about, get that first set of vitals and BBGs in and then head off. If you have a few extra minutes, try to take a look at the last attending's note. That will give you an idea where the pt stands on being treated for active problems and a ballpark idea of their disposition.\n\nGenerally I group my med passes at 9, 12, 2, and 5.\n\nI chart the basics - pain assessment, education, sepsis screen, etc - as I move through morning med pass or just after. It depends on how fast I'm moving. Assessments need to be done efficiently. Save wound assessments & dressing changes for that early afternoon slowdown.\n\nWe are lucky enough to do rounds in the middle of the day - that gives me more time to know wtf is going on. If that's not possible for you -- you may have to give them what you got from night shift plus a few extra details. This is where a dual-purpose report sheet (above) comes in handy.\n\nAfter the morning tornado of meds, assessments, people off to procedures, and rounds - things should ease up a little. Now you can work on your assessment charting, wound cares, and discharges - weaving them in between your patient rounding and other medications & cares.\n\nIf you're coming back the next day, hopefully you will get most of your patients back. Save that previous report sheet and use a different color ink for the next day. It will be easier to make sense of all the things you've jotted down and differentiate which day things took place on.\n\nYou've already got experience under your belt so your transition should be easier.
