the spoken language in all its registers, even with the more subtle social class variations.\n\nThere is a similar problem with medieval written Piemontese from the Sermoni Subalpini, which looks clearly more Occitan and French shifted than modern Piemontese, but we don't really know if people in Piemonte talked that way or it was more like a writing convention.\n\nIt's even possible that after the middle ages Lombard and Tuscan diverged in some aspects but converged in others (mostly the vocabulary I would say).\n\nAlso, keep in mind that Florence is very close to the linguistic border with the Gallo-Italic languages and northern Tuscan is clearly one of the most \"northern\" shifted Italo Dalmatian varieties.\n\nThere are also some features that are uniquely Gallo-Italic and

that they share much of their culture and language with us (especially with Lombards of course, way less with people from other regions).\n\nSomething similar can be said about Austrians and Germans and so on.\n\nYou also don't seem to aknowledge how diverse are the languages and cultures of Italy, not to mention how diverse they were some centuries ago.\n\nJust to give you an example, my regional language is linguistically closer to Occitan and French than to Tuscan or Neapolitan, because it's part of the whole Romance linguistic continuum, that in the past was also a cultural continuum, so I don't understand what do you mean when you say those languages are \"100% Italian\".\n\nIt would be like to say Portuguese, Castillian and Catalan are \"100% Iberic\".\n\nUnder

brands, advertisements, sport competions... (the complete list of life aspects in which the national identity is involved would be very long), so the perception is completely different from some century ago.\n\nIn general people tend to understimate the cultural impact of the formation of nation-states, because we take them for granted.\n\nThat said, probably you are right on the fact that in the 18th century in Corsica at least the Italian educated elites could be considered Italian, tough in a peculiar situation and keeping in mind that being Italian in pre-unification period was very different from what it means now.\n\nAlso, the Bonaparte family was peculiar even among Corsicans, because they could trace back a Tuscan origin.", "created_utc": "1653307512.0", "edited": "1653333647.0", "id": "i9oa09i", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_r3zq7e", "parent_id": "t1_i9o3enk", "score": "1", "subreddit": "MapPorn", "subreddit_id": "t5_2si92"}, {"author": "NikolaKrippa", "body": ">Native Corsicans are ethnic Italians. The Island's original inhabitants were from the Italian peninsula dating back to the Bronze age and the Etruscans.\n\nThis makes no sense.\n\nItaly as a concept didn't even exist in the bronze age and Italians are among the most genetically diverse people in Europe, with Northern Italians closer to French and Spaniards, while Southerners closer to Greeks.\n\nIf you want to argument for the italianness of Coriscans, ok, but please don't use this nonsensical ethnonationalist and genetic \"arguments\".\n\nBtw, more seriously, Corsicans became \"Italians\" (more like Tuscans actually) way later than the bronze age, after they were colonized by Pisa and Genova.\n\nBefore they were culturally, linguistically and to some extent even genetically more similar to Sardinians, who are a quite distinct group too, that also became Italian quite late and still today many of them don't really feel Italian.\n\nPost-medieval Corsicans were culturally very similar to Italians, yes, and in some periods many of them, especially the eliters, identified as Italian, yes, but they are also quite peculiar.\n\nI'm Italian and I know that before the 18th/19th century even mainland Italians didn't care much about the Italian identity, except maybe some educated people.\n\nThe average Italian identified with his city, region, state and so on, while Italianness was a vague and distant concept.\n\nIt isn't a case that Paoli was an educated Corsican and lived in the 18th century, when Italian nationalism started to became a thing among the elites, but keep in mind that Paoli and his father fought even against the Republic of Genova, an Italian state, for the independence of Corsica, so it's complicated.\n\nIn general, the ethnognesis of Italians have been a long, complex and diverse process that ended only in the 20th century, when within the Italian nation-state evolved a unified Italian culture and the school system and media spread the Italian identity even to the most remote villages.\n\nCorsicans participated only partially to that process, so it's undeniable that they have strong ties with Italy, but at the same time they are distinct, kind of like Swiss Italians, even if in a different way.\n\nEven more generally, Europe is full of ethnic and national groups that share strong ties with their neighbors, but they are also distinct.\nThink about Swiss
