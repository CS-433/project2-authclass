He was having extreme anger issues. Hallucinations. Unbridled panic and paranoia. In his moments of lucidity, he was afraid he was going crazy, and with good reason. From a CNN article that interviewed his wife, Susan Schneider Williams:\n\nDescription of Lewy body dementia:\n\n> \"Lewy body dementia has more than 40 symptoms that can randomly appear and disappear, Schneider Williams said. Categorically, the signs include impaired thinking, fluctuations in attention, problems with movement, visual hallucinations, sleep disorders, behavioral and mood issues, and changes in bodily functions such as the ability to control urinating.\"\n\nRobin Williams:\n\n> Robin had been experiencing severe memory, movement, personality, reasoning, sleep and mood changes.\n\n> ... paranoia was another significant symptom, Schneider Williams said. \"It was the amygdala region of his brain that had a ginormous amount of the Lewy bodies. So that area of the brain is really our ability to regulate our emotions, particularly fear and anxiety. And Robin's was basically broken.\"\n\n> Toward the end, Williams also experienced delusional looping. \"Your brain is concocting a story of what you think reality is,\" Schneider Williams said. \"And the people around you are unable to rationalize with you and bring you back into what is actually real. So it's incredibly scary for everyone around someone who's deluded as well as the deluded person.\n\n> \"Lewy body is neurological; it's a circuitry problem. So the chemical and structural changes happening in Robin's brain were responsible for the psychiatric symptoms that he was experiencing,\" Schneider Williams said at Life Itself. Those included depression.\n\n> The doctors Schneider Williams met with after learning of his diagnosis \"indicated his was one of the worst pathologies they had seen. He had about 40% loss of dopamine neurons,\" she wrote in her 2016 article \"The terrorist inside my husband's brain\" for the journal Neurology. \"The massive proliferation of Lewy bodies throughout his brain had done so much damage to neurons and neurotransmitters that in effect, you could say he had chemical warfare in his brain.\"\n\nSource: https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/01/health/lewy-body-dementia-robin-williams-life-itself-wellness/index.html\n\nHe had a very severe case of a very specific type of dementia.

There's no \"children\". There's \"boy\", there's \"girl\", there's \"girls\" (only girls) and there's \"boys\" (which can either mean only boys, or all children).\n\nThe theory is that this can keep girls guessing whether they're being adressed and included in the activity or not, whereas boys always know they're being adressed and included.\n\nSome people say that the masculine form being the default is just a grammar thing and shouldn't matter. Some people say that it does matter.

You read the article and see the journalist has absolutely no understanding of either the facts or the issues. Often, the article is so wrong it actually presents the story backward\u2014reversing cause and effect. I call these the \"wet streets cause rain\" stories. Paper's full of them.\n\n> In any case, you read with exasperation or amusement the multiple errors in a story, and then turn the page to national or international affairs, and read as if the rest of the newspaper was somehow more accurate about Palestine than the baloney you just read.

Urea, creatinine, uric acid, and prostatic\u2010specific antigen (PSA) concentrations were assessed in urinary samples before sexual stimulation (BSU) and after squirting (ASU), and squirting sample itself (S).\n\n> Results\n\n> In all participants, US1 confirmed thorough bladder emptiness. After a variable time of sexual excitation, US2 (just before squirting) showed noticeable bladder filling, and US3 (just after squirting) demonstrated that the bladder had been emptied again.

How about complex ones? \n\nIf you can have simple conversations on things related to daily life, like your family, your job and your city as long as people speak clearly and slowly, that's A1. If you can have conversations on complex and abstract issues, you can defend your opinion with arguments and you can use idiomatic expressions to do it, that's C1. If you can even understand cultural references, subtext, and humour, that's C2. \n\nSo, if you're looking at skills and not grammar, that's basically the CEFR, only you're using a homebrew version, which is, of course, perfectly fine.\n\nAdditionally, I don't think I mentioned grammar, although I do need to go back and check to make sure. You asked \"why are people in a hurry to learn\", and I basically answered \"so we're able to fully interact with and explore the target culture\". And I mentioned B2 as the level of skill where you're able to really start doing just that.\n\nI'm not big on grammar, to be honest. I'm more of a \"read a lot and develop a feeling for what's correct\" kind of person.\n\nEDIT: I forgot to mention that I also hope you attain your goals, and that I hope you enjoy the process, too!", "created_utc": "1655465294.0", "edited": "1655466413.0", "id": "icp3w08", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_vdxyov", "parent_id": "t1_icp2z27", "score": "10", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "dailycyberiad", "body": "My mother tongue, Basque, uses YYYY/MM/DD.

Whereas in Chinese, generally, you learn one h\u00e0nz\u00ec and one reading for it, and that's all. The reading for the same character doesn't (usually) change from one word to the other. \n\nYou replied:\n> But Cantonese and Mandarin pronounce the same h\u00e0nz\u00ec differently. So those are different readings of the same character. Surely they'd need to write that, reflect it somehow. \n\nAnd someone answered:\n> In one specific region with one specific spoken language or a specific regional pronunciation for a h\u00e0nz\u00ec, there's still one specific reading for a h\u00e0nz\u00ec. It might be different from the very widely taught Beijing Mandarin one, for example, but it's still only one. The speakers of that language or dialect will learn their regional version, and that's all. \n\n> Otherwise, it's like saying you need phonetic transcripts on top of English-language texts to show how it's pronounced in Texas and in Boston. A Texan English speaker will be perfectly able to understand what the English speaker from Boston wrote; if read aloud, it will sound different depending on the reader, but that doesn't mean they need phonetic explanations.\n\nAnd I add:\n\nThe word \"house\" can be pronounced \"hewse\", \"howse\" or even \"whose\", depending on the variety of English being spoken, but each speaker will know one pronunciation of it, so no phonetic transcriptions necessary.\n\nWhen in one same region, one same character can be read differently by the same speaker depending on context or word, that's when you need furigana.\n\nSo that's why they mentioned the English-language examples.

Yo he cantado, I've sung. \n\nNotice that \"past unfinished\", \"past, finished, several parts\", etc. are translations of the literal names of the tenses.\n\nAFAIK, Latin-America uses a different system to name the tenses, where \"Pret\u00e9rito\" is one specific tense, so only one of the past tenses has \"Pret\u00e9rito\" in the name, which IMO makes names shorter but creates confusion.
