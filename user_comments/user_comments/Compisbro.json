I don't know how classes are structured in Mexico but I recently started teaching foreign language in the USA. The district/state basically dictates how much content you have to cover. Your boss basically says \"I want the kids here by the end of 9 weeks etc \" and it can impact your credentials if the state deems you an ineffective teacher. The vast amount of material kind of forces you to overload kids with conjugations and stuff when they should be focusing on speaking with confidence.\n\n I'm relatively new to this but I am teaching Spanish two and I am basically forced to follow the textbook. (was told not to deviate) In the first two weeks I am supposed to go over Ser, Estar, Tener, Regular AR,ER,IR verbs, adjectives, Ir+a+place, Hacer, Gustar, stem-changing verbs, and a couple other things. 5 class periods to cover all of that. Mind you most of my kids can't say \"Hi how are you?\" because this school basically had substitutes all last year who would just hand out worksheets, never explain anything and just passed the kids. I tried to argue for my students saying that they don't know Spanish 1 stuff and I am not reviewing..... I have to teach them things they would of had 9 weeks to learn in Spanish 1 in two weeks. I get the school wants them at a certain level but this is a poor school. Many of my kids are way below their reading level in English. This type of high pressure unnatural learning environment will just push them to cheat. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n I LOVE languages and know that this crap isn't what is going to inspire most kids to speak and learn a language but I literally can't do anything about it. Talking to colleagues who have been doing this for years, sometimes decades, this is basically the experience. They try to be as creative as possible but this is how foreign languages are \"supposed\" to be taught in the USA and unfortunately it is heavy writing with low speaking. (Despite the standards saying 90% talking in Spanish is the goal.)  I learn languages as a hobby . I would love to structure my class just like I learn languages. Lot's of input, maybe setting up an SRS system for the kids. Spanish 1 would cover the same material but I would heavily focus on building core vocab and building their confidence in speaking. Give them a real strong language core so when they walked into Spanish 2 we can start being nitpicky with tenses and stuff.  I get that in reality we would have to talk about verb conjugations and all that jazz but kids HATE that stuff. \n\nI try to be as creative as I can and much of my teaching has to be virtual cause of COVID so that sucks. Maybe once I am more tenured the school might look the other way while I try new stuff out. But for now... I have to teach a language a way I fundamentally disagree with.

This is the book where Harry is becoming a teen and his emotions are becoming much more complicated. \n\n2.) Eh I agree... kind of . The second film just recycles a lot of the soundtrack from the first one and a couple of tracks sound like Star Wars.

My first is that my definition of fluent may be different from yours. I see fluency as near native personally but respect anyone who has a different definition.  My second disclaimer is that I have yet to become 'fluent' in a foreign language at the level that meets my personal standards so take any of my opinions with a grain of salt.                                                                                                                              I have however become functional in two foreign languages.  I define functional as being able to hold down a job in that language although one would still struggle at times and it would be obvious you were a foreigner. I also include being able to read novels at least at the young adult level (Think maybe the 7th harry potter) and understand 98% of the vocab and get the rest from context. I think you should also be able to understand at least 90% of what is spoken. The path to functional to me is pretty easy. As you said Discipline is key but once you have your schedule straight it really is as simple as reading, listening , speaking, writing and of course grammar and vocab drills. You work at a level that is challenging enough that you learn but not so out of your level that it discourages you and you get stuck forever. Fluency however, at least as I've defined it personally, requires a bigger commitment. The march to functional requires you to set aside a certain amount of time and in that time you study or \"practice\". Fluency requires you to dive into the language completely. (as much as you can). For example, I know that once I'm home from work I could force myself to do EVERYTHING in French. Reading, watching the news, googling, writing, watching TV/movies everything should be catered as if I were a monolingual French speaker. Doing that every single day by effectively \"banning\" all other languages at my house as much as possible and I will get pretty close to native as time goes on. I obviously don't have evidence to support this because I don't think a study like this has been done to prove it. However,  I basically grew up on the internet and all the people that have near native fluency in English despite not knowing a fluent English speaker in person and having never gone to an English speaking country basically adapted the lifestyle I describe. When I ask them \"How is your English so good?\" Most of the responses talk about how all the good movies/tv shows/anything that they like were readily available in English and hard to find in their native language so once they got home everyday they would do everything in English as it was their only option. (They like me spent most of their free time on the internet)                               **What are you struggling the most?** My biggest struggle is adapting the lifestyle I have described. I have tried multiple times in the past to implement but I am quite attached to the content readily available in my native English. Don't get me wrong; being functional in Spanish and French means that occasionally I find a really good film/tv show/youtuber/book that I really like and I can binge it for hours but I can't do that every single day for a period of several months or longer. The times that I tried I felt like I was constantly searching for new content that I enjoyed and would just naturally start making exceptions and start interacting with stuff in English. (Oh, a show I like is back, OF COURSE I'm not gonna watch it dubbed in Spanish or French but this is just a small exception to mainly using Spanish/French) Eventually I go back to using English most days all day and occasionally stumbling across content in a foreign language I enjoy and spending a week binging it like crazy. I'm married to a fellow language enthusiast so we speak Spanish at home but as they are military that's also not consistent as they deploy and once gone I go right back to mostly English most of the time. **So to make this short I would say I'm struggling the most to find content in foreign languages that I actually like.**", "created_utc": "1556407776.0", "edited": "1556408023.0", "id": "ely20pk", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_bhxznh", "parent_id": "t3_bhxznh", "score": "3", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "Compisbro", "body": "As others have said level is more impressive to me.

You can fully immerse yourself in a language at home with just your computer and internet. You just have to tell yourself, \"When I walk through my door ALMOST EVERYTHING, my hobbies, my social media, my TV shows, my books, my thoughts will be done in my target language \" and you need to stick to it no excuses. Only use your other languages if you HAVE to communicate with people who don't know your target language.  Even days you feel tired you need to do it. I used to be friends online with this guy from Bulgaria. He had never left Bulgaria in his life and was pretty poor so his school basically sucked. He spoke perfect English, and I mean perfect. It was insane he had a VERY slight accent. I asked him how he did it and he literally just said, \"I only used the internet in English, I make friends online (he played guild wars a lot) and we only chat in English, I watched movies in English and everything. I did that for years \" He was able to immerse himself in English only while he was in his room (And being a teen like me at the time, spent several hours a day in his room haha) He apparently was really good at Mandarin too according to several of our common friends in our skype group but that's because he really liked Chinese literature/cinema and since he was already fluent in English spent a lot of time doing almost everything in Chinese. (Playing Chinese MMORPGs) Crazy thing was he wasn't even a language enthusiast/aspiring polyglot. He just wanted to do it so he did xD\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYes, if you can go to a country where the language is spoken it is a great motivation to keep practicing but I feel like people really overestimate the number of times you will be \"forced\" to use it. Expats live in countries for decades and hardly speak the language. I know people who wanted to learn the language of the country they were in but then naturally gravitated towards expat communities without meaning to and before they knew it were speaking English 95% of their day unless they were at the store or something.  (My parents lived in Germany for 5 years. They wanted to learn German but never did the work so when they left Germany could hardly order their food. ) So yes, it is a correct expectation as you put it but it is a lot of hard work. Changing your thinking language/the language you do your hobbies in is going to be hard. Your brain will fight you tooth and nail because it is used to doing it all in your native language (or English) . Yes, at first you will be frustrated because you not being fluent in the language will mean your brain will hurt as you start doing everything in your target language but I promise you will improve quickly because you've given yourself no choice. If you do this by the time you make it to the country that speaks your language you should be fine.

Then, since it is all in Anki my goal is usually about 20 new words a day when I'm ready to start reading HP.

I think ego is the main reason why people let their minds become weak as well as general societal changes that has led some people to think that intelligence levels have dropped.  I think most people (If we exclude the exceptional or those suffering from intelligence issues they were born with) have about the same amount of [i](https://intelligence.At)ntelligence.  At least in the west, in which I grew up in, a lot of kids are raised with this idea that each and every person is special. This is important as it teaches confidence but I feel like the schools leave out that we as a society have to work together and people end up learning the confidence good willed teachers teach them and turn it into arrogance. Then pride basically sets in and they refuse to want to hear anything that opposes their worldview. Growing up I have seen people's success in life limited not by their intelligence or lack thereof but by their unwillingness to admit they are wrong. I have seen adults get defensive and even visibly agitated when you correct them on something they are saying even if it is factually false and you can prove it to them. I have seen these very adults even suggest the facts are, \"fake\", without any information to back their claim other than the fact that it goes against their worldview; some even inventing or prescribing to conspiracy theories to avoid hurting their pride. The very idea of being wrong about something is seen as an insult.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso, we in the west have changed our view of leisure time as well. We glorify leisure time and make it the ultimate goal. People work so that they can lay around and buy things or watch TV or sit on social media. There is absolutely nothing wrong with any of these things of course, but many people I know (Anecdotal evidence I know) and have met do these things to unhealthy and addictive levels. Unfortunately, society doesn't view addictive behavior as bad as a whole.(Unless it is drugs and alcohol)  We laugh about binge-watching or sitting on our phones for hours/picking up our phones every couple of minutes, and might even go as far to passively say something like, \"Oh I should spend less time on this stuff\" but few actually can will themselves to do it and will often make excuses as to why they can't; or just be completely in denial of the fact that they cant. I think this generally has led to weaker minds as every time you participate in addictive behavior your will gets weaker and weaker. Of course, if you ever bring this up, the pride I wrote about before is still there and people will accuse you of blaming technology which is, of course, ridiculous because as I previously said; It is not the technology itself but the addiction to it that has led to this result.  The intelligence is there but most people don't keep their minds working and just like any other muscle, the mind will weaken itself.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWith that said, if someone is generally happy spending all their free time sitting on social media or binging shows I have no issue with it. It is their life and I don't think one needs to be productive/ spend time strengthening their minds to be happy. Happiness is the goal after all. I just think it is super dangerous if people do all of this and then still stay in the delusion that their opinion/worldview is somehow any better than anyone else.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat's just my thoughts on it though; I know some recent studies have shown that while IQ is going up in developing countries and it is becoming stagnant in western/more developed nations but these studies don't give any real answers as to why this is.

If I didn't understand a word it rarely impedes overall comprehension and I typically get by fine. I do watch a lot of youtube in spanish though so my listening is waaaaay better than my speaking. But this idea that a lot of B2 speakers would need people to slow down probably only applies to people who speak at B2 but whose listening skills are like a B1 or A2 (I used to tutor people in french and ran across people like this all the time) . \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhen learning languages people often accidentally neglect certain skills, (I personally neglect writing and reading as long as I can so Master speaking and listening quicker), but then tell themselves that their proficiency is all at one level even though they haven't put the same effort into all their skills. Btw I'm not talking about the official tests just what definitions say each level is. I knew a guy who actually passed the C2 exam in Italian and he admitted to me he could hardly understand or speak the language (He said those two skills were B2 on a good day) and that was barely able to get by on those sections but aced the writing and reading portions.", "created_utc": "1537506279.0", "edited": "False", "id": "e6d3ajo", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_9ebmnu", "parent_id": "t1_e5ogcpd", "score": "1", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "Compisbro", "body": "I typically don't like language partners for a couple reasons.

They want to sit and talk to me in English/French about the weather today for the 50th time this month and I'm trying to practice the subjunctive in Spanish and they just want to talk about the weather. Another is even if you do find the perfect language match up it is difficult to get time tables together. Time zones, different stages of life, even personality are all factors. I have gotten lucky in the past and found the perfect language partner I needed at that time but life gets in the way and either I or the partner end up responding less and less until every couple of months we send the quick, \"Hey I'm not dead just been super busy!\".\n\nThe majority of partners only last a couple days sadly before they give up or you get busy and they get mad so they dont reply when you return. But hey, depending on your level a couple days might be perfectly fine for you if you don't mind switching through partners quickly.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI say the best advice is to find native speakers in non-language learning communities online. I love video gaming so I constantly chat with other gamers and I try to find the ones that only speak my target language who don't want to learn languages in general. They often end up helping me more with my mistakes than language partners with the forever struggle of which language gets more time and I get to make new friends while playing video games.

It was mainly the internet that made me figure it out. I got my first computer at the end of 6th grade and would stare at photos of guys and although I wasn't fully cognizant of sex (I didn't touch myself until I was about to start 8th grade )  I just know I really liked looking at them. I would even put on gay porn. I used to think masturbate had something to do with the word \"Master\" and somehow though it was hot xD.(A master guy or w/e the kinks started early haha)  Of course on gay porn sites back then there would be a lot of straight porn and nude women but I never felt anything towards them, actually I would get this revolting feeling every time boobs or a vagina would pop up like \"ewwww.\" Anyway going into high school I knew what I was but went through the whole \"I'm Bi \" thing. Even managed to get a \"girlfriend\" who was crazy about me and always tried to initiate kissing/sex but I always made an excuse to get the hell out of there.

Anyway, I shit you not the first day she started using that treatment I immediately wasn't attracted to her anymore. I couldn't even kiss her anymore. It was like night and day and super weird.

What I most often encounter with Latinos who grow up here is that they are completely fluent in English but often struggle to express themselves completely in Spanish thus resort to Spanglish.

I often get , \"What does that mean?\" \"Oh, we use -insert Spanglish word here which is just an English word they made to fit into Spanish pronunciation-\" and when I tell them that that's a Spanglish word and not an actual Spanish word they get all upset with me. I don't mind Spanglish, hell I grew up with it, but some people really need to recognize that there is no shame in admitting that they speak Spanglish and not Spanish. Spanglish is an interesting sociolect and it is no way less than Spanish. But try dropping some of these Latinos in a Spanish speaking country and have them work in a Spanish speaking office. They'd realize real quick their actual proficiency.

I would obviously keep studying on the side. One of my favorite shows is Charmed and I watch it without subtitles dubbed in my target language. I have seen every episode of all eight seasons like 10 times (in multiple languages now) and I usually watch an episode a day and by the time I finish I have the general flow of the language down. There are 178 episodes of charmed so it takes me that many days to watch it with an episode a day, and honestly, about halfway through with the study I do on the side I start understanding a lot of what they're saying and by season 6 I am picking up almost everything. I have as of yet to watch season 8 and not catch a word. Hope that helps a bit? (Btw I know dubbed audio is not always \"Natural Speech\" but after watching 178 episodes in only the language I can understand the language from any source. Even native sources.  )", "created_utc": "1534908530.0", "edited": "False", "id": "e4m23ko", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_995aen", "parent_id": "t3_995aen", "score": "1", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}]
