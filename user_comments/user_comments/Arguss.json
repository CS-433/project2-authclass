Learning a language actually consists of 4 different skills: Reading, Writing, Speaking, and Listening, and you need to practice each of those skills to improve them. \n\nDuolingo doesn't require you to practice writing your own sentences much, especially if you're just doing the bit where you have a word bank rather than typing in the sentences yourself. If you want to get better at writing in German, you need to practice...writing in German. \n\nr/WriteStreakGerman is the subreddit for just that, with friendly German natives who will correct your writing (they're very nice!).\n\nThere's also [DeepL](https://www.deepl.com/en/translator), which is like Google Translate, but better. That's a way of checking your German without needing an actual person to correct it. It's not 100% accurate, but it's pretty accurate.\n\nThird, you probably need something other than Duolingo to explain the grammar for you, because Duolingo is shit at explaining grammar. I would know, I also started with Duolingo. The aforementioned [Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/German/wiki/index/) has a lot of links, but I'll suggest just one to you: the YouTube Channel [YourGermanTeacher](https://www.youtube.com/c/YourGermanTeacher/playlists). They are German teachers with playlists of videos to go through all the grammar you need, in order. \n\nStart with the A1.1 Grammar playlist, and work through it. Then do the A1.2 Grammar playlist. Then A2.1, A2.2, and B1.1. If you have some sort of grammar question, chances are they have a video to explain it to you. If that doesn't work, try googling it and/or searching in this subreddit (we've had a lot of prior threads about grammar questions.)\n\nFourth, start looking into graded readers for German for level A1 or A2. Reading other people's sentences will help give you an idea of how to structure sentences in German, so reading will help you to learn the German sentence structure. [Here](https://www.amazon.de/Learn-German-Stories-Collectors-Beginners/dp/1511565276) is one such set of graded readers.", "created_utc": "1666599145.0", "edited": "False", "id": "itkcym8", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_ybsv9s", "parent_id": "t3_ybsv9s", "score": "3", "subreddit": "German", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qq51"}, {"author": "Arguss", "body": "Es ist keine Beleidigung.

That means their only real electoral threat is from the extreme wing of their party (left for Dems, right for Reps).\n\nAs a result, they are incentivized to both move away from the center, to stave off attacks from the flanks, which works great for getting elected...and then leaves a gaping hole between the average Dem and average Rep, which is difficult to bridge to get significant reforms done. That, combined with the filibuster in the Senate practically requiring cross-party collaboration for major non-budget legislation, leaves us with gridlock.\n\nIn a multiparty system, though, the two main parties don't primary themselves and constantly egg people on to become more extreme. That leaves room in the middle for policy overlap. It also leaves open the possibility of a coalition that crosses the middle line, like the Soc Dems + Greens + FDP in Germany.\n\n>  your policy doesn't not go through because of the system, it doesn't go through because it's unpopular\n\nThat's not true. There are a number of policies that are popular but don't get passed, because Dem voters support it and half of Republican voters support it, but that means it's a contentious issue *within* the Republican party, and (as said above) Republicans are incentivized to side with the more extreme half of the party so as to not get primaried, so they oppose it and singlehandedly block it from passing, because like 25% of the electorate is against it.\n\nFor example, in my state of Arkansas, we passed a minimum wage raise and legalized medical marijuana despite the objections of the Republican legislature. That's something our state constitution allows, is these ballot referendums that bypass the legislature, but those aren't allowed at a national level, and so the federal minimum wage is stuck where it was set by Dems back in 2007, and marijuana federally remains completely illegal, even though both are popular and have healthy majorities in favor.\n\nEdit: to give some numbers: [71% of Americans](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/minimum-wage-opinion-poll-09-05-2021/) say the minimum wage should be raised.\n\n[91% of Americans say marijuana should be legal for medical use, including 87% of Republicans.](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/04/16/americans-overwhelmingly-say-marijuana-should-be-legal-for-recreational-or-medical-use/)\n\nTotal legalization is less popular, at only 60%, but is still supported by 47% of Republicans.", "created_utc": "1666083987.0", "edited": "1666084973.0", "id": "iss5kcq", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_y6kxew", "parent_id": "t1_isrjd7u", "score": "1", "subreddit": "SocialDemocracy", "subreddit_id": "t5_2sjw0"}, {"author": "Arguss", "body": "Danke!", "created_utc": "1666071554.0", "edited": "False", "id": "isrqzp9", "is_submitter": "True", "link_id": "t3_y59sxn", "parent_id": "t1_isripsk", "score": "2", "subreddit": "WriteStreakGerman", "subreddit_id": "t5_364k6p"}, {"author": "Arguss", "body": "Danke!", "created_utc": "1666071414.0", "edited": "False", "id": "isrqsqw", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_y5mw2m", "parent_id": "t1_isrjhy4", "score": "2", "subreddit": "WriteStreakGerman", "subreddit_id": "t5_364k6p"}, {"author": "Arguss", "body": "N\u00f6\u00f6\u00f6\u00f6\u00f6\u00f6\u00f6!\n\nDanke.", "created_utc": "1666034548.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ispl6dx", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_y66uuy", "parent_id": "t1_ispecfl", "score": "4", "subreddit": "WriteStreakGerman", "subreddit_id": "t5_364k6p"}, {"author": "Arguss", "body": "Ein Thema zu finden ist ein gro\u00dfes Problem f\u00fcr jeder, der hier langfristig schreibt.

Staying in the bed, she heard birds singing outside (of) the window. ~~Passing through the gap between curtains~~, **T**he first sunbeam, **passing through the gap between curtains**,^(1) shone right into her eyes. She was still in the bed. Wrapped in the soft and warm blanket, she didn\u2019t want to leave her room or do anything at all. Every sound from outside pierced through the airy silence of early morning. Ellie discerned^(2) the wind soughing^(3) in the tree, playing with leaves. Her father had planted that tree 30 years ago when she had just been born. \u201cWhen\u2019s the last time I spoke with my father?\u201d she thought. Trying to avoid sad thoughts, she decided to get out of bed and start a new day.  \n>  \n>Having disentangled **herself** from the blanket, she trudged towards **the** bathroom. Gloom and her thin face glanced at her from the mirror. She dragged herself from the bathroom to the kitchen. For one whole minute, she ~~was staring~~ **stared** into the fridge deciding what to eat.^(4) Eating some porridge, she contemplated the^(5) old photo of her family. A strong man with a moustache^(6), a young woman in a bright and colourful^(6) summer dress and a small happy girl with a joyful smile on her face look**ed** at her from this photo.^(4) Being done with her food, Ellie picked up the laptop from the floor, settled herself in an armchair, and started working.\n\n^(1) Having the clause \"passing through the gap between curtains\" before you've mentioned the actual subject is confusing; it sounds like Ellie is passing through the gap between the curtains. It's not strictly wrong, but can be confusing.\n\n^(2) I understand what you mean, but \"discerned\" does not sound natural here. A simpler word like \"heard\" would actually work here much better.\n\n^(3) \"Soughing\" appears to be used correctly here, but (speaking as a native English speaker) I have literally never heard this word before in my life.\n\n^(4) There's some time skips: We skip from her deciding what to eat, straight to her already eating the porridge (that we didn't know she had decided on eating). Similarly, we skip from her eating to being done with her food. I think the issue here is the -ing clauses, the present participle clauses--we skip straight to an action that is already happening without starting it/finishing off the prior action. Like with #5, this *can* work as a kind of literary/poetic way of phrasing things, but it can also come off as a bit stilted/disjointed.\n\n^(5) Very minor, but \"the\" here implies that we either already know about the photo or *should* know about the photo, despite it being new information. That is something you can do, is just insert information in a way that assumes the reader already knows about it, but it can confuse some readers if it's not already clear that this is your style, your [voice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Writing_style#Writer's_voice).\n\n^(6) These are British spellings. American English would be \"mustache\" and \"colorful\". Not wrong, just be aware of who your audience is.\n\n\\---\n\nOverall, this is pretty high-level stuff-- I'm mostly nitpicking here about minor details rather than any major grammatical or spelling errors.

For example, r/WriteStreakGerman has native speakers who voluntarily correct your German writing submissions. Technically that's someone else helping teach you. [DeepL](https://www.deepl.com/en/translator) is like Google Translate but better. Googling, \"kaufen verkaufen unterschied\" will usually pull up a question website like HiNative or Quora or whatever, where someone has already asked this question, and someone else has already answered it.\n\nIn these and other ways, it's possible to learn over the internet without taking an official course. The issue is that you're always making a trade-off: **the less money you spend, the more time you generally have to dedicate** to make up for that. Courses are useful because it's offloading the admin part of learning to somebody else. They're also useful because it's someone else dictating the pace, making sure you're keeping a good speed. By yourself, it's easy to get lazy and have a slower pace than you would want.\n\n>How much time do I realistically need to finish B2 if I study 5-7 days a week for 1-2 hours?\n\nI do not yet consider myself B2 (I've never taken any official test, to be clear), and I've been learning German for 2 years and 2 months now. I started out doing 1-2 hours a day, but I've been increasing that over time, especially for listening practice through podcasts, and by reading news articles.\n\nOne issue I've had is that I'm quite shy and find it difficult to practice speaking with others, which has significantly hindered my speaking progress. That's another thing to note: listening, speaking, reading, and writing are 4 separate skills, each of which you must practice in order to advance them all.\n\nBut anyway, I've not spoken with natives much, and I've been a bit lazy at times with studying grammar (I pretty much always listen to something in German each day, and write daily). As such, **if your goal is to become B2 or C1 in less than 2 years**, I suggest you dedicate as much time as possible to learning German, and consider taking an official course/hiring a tutor on iTalki/having a teacher who can guide you faster and more efficiently than learning it yourself.\n\n>Is Duolingo even helpful for someone like me trying to become proficient in German?\n\nDuolingo is useful as a tool when you're A1/A2, for learning vocabulary and learning the basic structure of German sentences.

Es gibt 3 verschiedene Modelle der Repr\u00e4sentation:\n\n1. Der Abgeordnete kann ein Spiegel sein; Er spiegelt die Meinungen seiner W\u00e4hlerschaft vollst\u00e4ndig wieder. In diesem Modell hat der Abgeordnete keine Freiheit, er muss die W\u00e4hler\\*innen genau wiedergeben. Wenn 51% seines Wahlkreises an etwas glauben, stimmt er daf\u00fcr.\n2. Der Abgeordnete kann ein Delegierter sein; Die W\u00e4hler\\*innen vertrauen ihm und verlassen sich auf ihn. Er trifft Entscheidungen eigenst\u00e4ndig und hat die Freiheit, seine eigenen politischen Meinungen auszudr\u00fccken, denn die W\u00e4hler\\*innen vertrauen auf sein Urteilsverm\u00f6gen und darauf, dass er ihre Interessen wahren wird.\n3. Eine Mischung aus den ersten beiden Modellen.\n\nAber dar\u00fcber hinaus gibt es eine zeitliche Dimension: Vielleicht handelt der Abgeordnete in Wahrung unserer Interessen, aber nicht unserer kurzfristigen Interessen, sondern unserer mittel- oder langfristigen Interessen.\n\nDiese Interessen k\u00f6nnen sich widersprechen; Ein Baby will keinen Nadelstich, aber die Mutter und die \u00c4rztin tun das, um das Baby vor Krankheit zu sch\u00fctzen.\n\nDadurch ist es m\u00f6glich, als Abgeordneter die kurzfristigen Interessen der W\u00e4hler\\*innen zu ignorieren oder sogar zu widersprechen, aber gleichzeitig die *langfristen* Interessen der W\u00e4hler\\*innen zu wahren.\n\nIch glaube, Finanzminister Lindner hat seine eigene Entscheidungen schon so gerechtfertigt, auch wenn sie bei den W\u00e4hler\\*innen momentan offensichtlich unpopul\u00e4r sind.\n\n...Andererseits sind die FDP selbst sehr unpopul\u00e4r geworden.", "created_utc": "1662191151.0", "edited": "1662191541.0", "id": "imwgx16", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_x3tokc", "parent_id": "t3_x3tokc", "score": "3", "subreddit": "WriteStreakGerman", "subreddit_id": "t5_364k6p"}, {"author": "Arguss", "body": "Mindestens f\u00fcnf Staffeln?

If I'm looking up a specific phrase or something and I come across a concept, I'll research the concept a bit, but nothing very formal.\n\nSo, it's sort of that I'm always doing something with my TL, but also not really \"studying\" per se in the proper sense. I don't think my method is particularly efficient, but I also don't have any deadlines, and the most important thing is that I'm doing something with the language every single day.", "created_utc": "1661409880.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ilpawxk", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_wx4ax5", "parent_id": "t3_wx4ax5", "score": "3", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "Arguss", "body": "Es ist immer erstaunlich, wie viele Fragen es noch geben kann, auch wenn die Serie schon seit Jahren nicht mehr produziert wird und Adam schon so viele Fragen beantwortet hat.", "created_utc": "1661408735.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ilp9eyg", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_wx5m97", "parent_id": "t3_wx5m97", "score": "2", "subreddit": "WriteStreakGerman", "subreddit_id": "t5_364k6p"}, {"author": "Arguss", "body": "Wie viele Stunden beim Sprachlernen verbringst du jeden Tag?

Disclaimer: I'm only B1, so I may get some of this wrong.\n\n---\n\nFirst off, notice that we're using an um...zu... Infinitivsatz here, which roughly means something like, \"(in order) to x\", where x is the verb.\n\nIch fahre zum Strand, um zu schwimmen.\nI'm driving to the beach, (in order) to swim.\n\nThat's step one, check out those **Infinitivs\u00e4tze with um...zu...**\n\nSecond, with every um...zu... you need a verb, which is usually at the end of the Infinitivsatz. Here, it's vorkommen. I know it says, \"vorzukommen\"; for separable verbs, you put the zu from the \"um...zu...\" construction between the prefix and the stem of the separable verb (look up **separable verbs** if you don't know what those are).\n\nThird, but wait, \"vorkommen\" doesn't mean \"to feel\", it means to happen or occur or exist? Well, here's where that \"sich\" comes in: turns out this is one of those fancy **reflexive verbs**, where you add on a reflexive pronoun which sometimes completely changes the meaning of the verb. So it turns out, the verb isn't \"vorkommen\", it's \"sich vorkommen\", meaning \"to feel\".\n\nNow we're getting somewhere: it's finally the season, (in order) to feel.... something. What? Well, look right next to vorzukommen: falsch = wrong.\n\nBut not just to feel wrong, but to feel wrong \"noch mehr als sonst\", semi-literally \"yet more than otherwise/usually\"\n\nIt's finally the season to feel even more wrong than usual.\n\n---\n\nI hope this helps.

Reddit doesn't like to **bold** stuff when it's just punctuation, hence why I have to write out comments down here.\n\n^(3) When you're giving an exact quote of what you or someone else was thinking, you [either put what you thought in quotation marks, or you can use italics](https://www.grammarbook.com/blog/quotation-marks/internal-dialogue-italics-or-quotes/) for it.

So it depends on if you're writing in British English or American English style.\n\n\\---\n\nTo actually respond to the post itself: I find it's always useful to think about people in terms of psychology and identity. People have a self-image, an identity of themselves.\n\nThis identity can be an idea or a characteristic that they believe about themselves: \"I am smart,\" \"I am athletic,\" \"I am hard-working.\"\n\nIt can also be an identity based on membership of a group: \"I am a Green Bay Packers fan\" (American football club), \"I am a Republican,\" \"I am a Catholic.\"\n\nPeople usually have multiple identities/multiple images of themselves that they carry around in their heads: \"I am a Republican AND a Catholic AND I am athletic, all at once.\"\n\nPeople tend to become hostile when they feel that one or more of those identities is becoming threatened--for example, if someone attacks Christianity and says God does not exist, that will trigger someone who is a Catholic and religious.\n\nBut it can also be more subtle than that--if their mental image of themselves is, \"I am smart,\" and the evidence for that is, \"I took French in high school, I can learn foreign languages, that means I'm smart\", and then you come along and you already speak 3 languages and might learn a 4th, that undermines how impressive them taking French in high school was, which in turn undermines the self-image of themself as being smart.\n\nIt can also be a social hierarchy thing--if they imagine themselves as being higher on the social ladder than you in some way, and then you unexpectedly undermine that by being better than them at something, that too can undermine that self-image they have of themselves being high on the social ladder.\n\nAnd once an identity gets threatened, again, people tend to become hostile.\n\nI don't know enough to say definitively what triggered this person, but those are some thoughts about what it *could have* been.", "created_utc": "1658671901.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ihg7k6j", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_w6qhyc", "parent_id": "t3_w6qhyc", "score": "2", "subreddit": "WriteStreakEN", "subreddit_id": "t5_2y42lo"}, {"author": "Arguss", "body": ">Lately, I've been having trouble using conjunctions and prepositions.

By default, all plants are containers you open and then pull the item out of, which is silly and tedious. This mod (or one like it) makes them act like in other games, where you simply harvest the plant with one click.\n\nThere's also some bug fixing mods like Morrowind Code Patch, although that also includes a bunch of other options you may or may not even understand at the moment.\n\nIf you don't want to get an alternative leveling mod, you should understand well how the leveling system works, so as to not shoot yourself in the foot. \n\nAttributes only go up on level up, and only the 3 you pick to increase. How much each attribute increases depends on how much you've used the skills of that attribute while you were gaining this level up. I forget the exact numbers, but 5 is the max amount you can increase an attribute per level, and you get that by having leveled skills governed by that attribute 10 times. If you leveled the relevant skills less than 10 times, you get a smaller potential increase of 1-4, depending on how many times you leveled the relevant skills.\n\nThis means for a \"maximally efficient\" level up, you should level up the skills of 3 different attributes 10 times each before each level up. Of course, each major/minor skill increase counts as 1/10th of you leveling up, so bizarrely to level efficiently you should have miscellaneous skills you are leveling consistently to get those +5 increases, perhaps even having your main skills you actually use be miscellaneous skills. The original leveling system clearly is \"fun\" :D.\n\nThe other issue is, Endurance determines both starting HP and HP gain per level. But by default it's not retroactive, so any time you aren't increasing Endurance as fast as possible just means a permanently lower HP Max than someone who had increased Endurance as fast as possible.

The date of January 6th was not an accident; that was the day that Congress was officially validating the votes and affirming that Biden had won the election.\n\nThis gets somewhat complicated because of the specifics of how American elections work, but basically it's not actually a popular vote, but instead based on the Electoral College and \"Electoral Slates\" sent by each state, where the state lists out Electors for their state and who they are voting for.\n\nCongress gets together on January 6th in the lower chamber, the House of Representatives, and validates these Electoral Slates, adding up the number of Electoral Votes for each candidate. The sitting Vice President presides over this meeting where they officially count the votes, and he affirms everything is valid and in order.\n\n\\---\n\nThings get more complicated at this point, but one key thing is that if a given state's electoral slate can't be certified (say, the slate of a swing state where voters narrowly voted for Biden instead of Trump), there can be a series of events that lead to Trump being chosen as President instead.\n\nThere are multiple ways to stop a state's electoral slate being certified, including the Vice President Pence rejecting the slate of a close swing state that voted for Biden and accepting an \"alternate\" slate voting for Trump instead. A second option involves Republicans in Congress objecting to the pro-Biden slate and voting for a pro-Trump \"alternate\" slate. A third option is *breaking in and stealing the slates from the House of Representatives on January 6th,* which would force the states to recertify and issue new slates (which would not have to match the first ones, but could potentially vote for Trump instead).\n\nPence ultimately refused to reject slates, saying he didn't have the constitutional authority to do so.\n\nCongressional Republicans split on objecting to the slates of the close swing states, with most House Republicans objecting, but Senate Republicans mostly refusing to join in with this form of legal coup, causing the objection to fail.\n\nOn the other hand, the rioters on January 6th did indeed break into the House of Representatives, and could have stolen the slates, except that quick-thinking congressional clerks grabbed the boxes containing them right as they were fleeing the chamber/the chamber was being breached.\n\n\"Okay,\" you say, \"but it's not like they were told to do that. It's not like you had the President saying to a crowd of people outside, 'You need to go in there and stop them from counting these pro-Biden slates and stealing the election from me.'\" Well, Trump did in fact have a speech that day just down the street from the House of Representatives:\n\n>**As to counting Biden's electoral votes, Trump said, \"We can't let that happen\"** and suggested Biden would be an \"illegitimate president\".  \n>  \n>Trump also said, \"you'll never take back our country with weakness. You have to show strength and you have to be strong. **We have come to demand that Congress do the right thing and only count the electors who have been lawfully slated.**\"  \n>  \n>\"**So we're going to, we're going to walk down Pennsylvania Avenue** \u2014 I love Pennsylvania Avenue \u2014 and we're going to the Capitol and we're going to try and give... the Democrats are hopeless.

I live in the US. I like to swim. I played baseball today.\n\nWith all of those, you're doing the main/independent clause structure, the Hauptsatz structure: Subject^(1), **conjugated verb/helper verb**, object/adverb stuff, **final verb stuff**.\n\nIch **habe** heute Baseball **gespielt**.\n\nIch **lebe** in den USA.\n\n^(1) (or rather, Topic, but you'll get there later)\n\n\\---\n\nNext step up would be to combine these simple sentences with coordinating conjunctions, so those conjunctions that combine two main clauses: aber, und, oder, etc.\n\nIch **habe** heute Baseball **gespielt**, aber ich **mag** Baseball nicht.\n\nThe most important thing at your level is to notice where the verb(s) go and remember that. The videos go into more detail on this; for a main clause/Hauptsatz, it's called \"V2\" word order, because the conjugated verb goes in the 2nd position (verb-2nd, V2).\n\n\\---\n\nNext step would be to add some dependent clauses, a Nebensatz. You know those are coming because there will be a subordinating conjunction that indicates it's about to be a dependent clause: dass, weil, wenn, als, ob, obwohl, etc.\n\nThat's like a Hauptsatz, except you pluck out all the verbs and then put them back into the sentence at the end in reverse order.\n\nI like cars. They are fast.\n\nIch **mag** Autos. Sie **sind** schnell.\n\nI like cars, because they are fast.\n\nIch **mag** Autos, weil sie schnell **sind**.\n\n\\---\n\nAt your level, this really doesn't have to be anything complicated, so keep it as simple as you can.
