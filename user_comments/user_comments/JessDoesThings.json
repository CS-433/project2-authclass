Video essays are my number one favorite genre on YT actually. I never played either LOU game but I enjoy watching all the discourse on the second game. Personally, I find the themes and story very interesting, and though I don't think the style of gameplay is for me, I would like to watch someone play the whole thing or watch the story aspects. I have watched a couple videos about it so I am pretty familiar with it. And also, anyone who clicks this video will already know the characters. I haven't played it and I remembered all the characters. You still say their names and remind the viewer who they are, while showing them on screen. So I think it was fine the way you talked about the characters.  \n\n\nOkay onto the review/critique.  \n\n\nThere are a lot of things you do really well here. First of all, I disagree about your \"performance\" needing to be more engaging. This is for a video essay. It doesn't need to sound like Jake Paul or whoever (he was the first one I thought of lol). I think you sound like any YouTuber doing a commentary or essay, even better than some of the ones I've watched. Audio sounds really good and professional.   \n\n\nIn general, your use of various gameplay clips was great. You would not stay on one long gameplay clip for too long. You switched it up to keep it interesting and would show relevant clips. That's an underrated part of video game essays so you have that down! You have a good feel for how long to stay on a single clip and keep it interesting.  \n\n\nThere were a couple moments in editing that I think really helped highlight your point from the script, too. There were other moments that detracted from your point, but I will get to that. I think you did well editing the part where >!Ellie and Abby are fighting at the end where it cuts to the flashback of Joel. !<That was well-done. It helped highlight your point>! that wanting to forgive Joel is the reason she doesn't kill Abby.  However, I was expecting the clip of Abby being let up from the water and gasping for breath just because I've seen that ending scene a bunch.  !<That might have made it a tiny bit more powerful to include that too instead of going straight to Ellie sitting in the water. Take that with a grain of salt though, as it is already well-edited and was impactful the way it was written and edited. Just an expectation I personally had.\n\nAny time you used gameplay in the essay to highlight your point in the script was pretty well-done. Alternatively, I don't like the song by Joel to bridge between the intro and the first argument/commentary point. It's too long and could either be implemented better in-essay or done as an end credits kind of thing. A couple  seconds of it before going to voice over might be a better compromise. I know it's an emotional moment but the full clip doesn't belong in this style of video, sorry. I really liked the >!flashforward moment from the ending, where you talk about how everything is fine, the perfectly pastoral scene for our main character who has found peace, only to have it interrupted by her nightmares of Joel. !<That was a nicely done by you! Good editing and good writing there. It was very impactful.  \n\n\nSome negatives: I don't think the intro was very strong. Aside from the 50 seconds of video clips and no talking, the actual intro was difficult to decipher. I listened to it many times. It was read very quickly and is overly written in my mind. Stronger, clearer writing would help. You say the word themes a lot and reference criticisms and say some verbose things that come across as clunky and the first time I heard it I was totally lost. You do mention that you think it's a meditation on purpose and how you disagree with some of the criticisms of it, so I understand you do lay out what the video is about, but it is weakly written, repetitive, and not representative of how well you can actually write in the rest of the video. I think there is a way to do an intro with the things you've included, maybe reworked to be more engaging and clear.   \n\n\nAs a video about the cycle of violence and forgiveness, it is a strong video. In the wake of a lot of critiques about it, I think this serves as a good defense. Your editing is overall good, save for a couple of those spots that drag early on. Audio is clear and professional-sounding, though I think the intro is too fast and has its own unique issues.   \n\n\nHope this helps!
