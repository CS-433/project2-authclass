The more the telescope can see at once, the fewer individual observations that are needed to complete the survey. The better the sensitivity, the shorter the amount of time each individual observation has to be.\n\nASKAP maximises its FOV through Phased Array Feeds (PAFs): essentially, each of its receivers has multiple electronic elements which look in slightly different directions. So even though the dishes will be pointing at a particular point on the sky at any one time, each element of the phased array will have a slight offset. ASKAP can form 36 separate 'beams' in this way and tile them together to make one big image. \n\nThis method of increasing the FOV is completely separate to the telescope's resolution, which is determined by the largest distance between any two dishes in the array (i.e. the longest 'baseline') \u2014\u00a0this is radio interferometry. \n\nASKAP has actually already done a shallow survey of the whole of the southern sky: RACS.

It sounds like you're in a great position to take the first step, and the OU is a very well-regarded physics course. I know a few people who came into physics a bit later in their careers by doing an OU degree and then progressed to MSc and PhD courses. Your software experience will come in extremely useful as coding is one of the most important skills there is in physics. Rather than trying to plan out a whole route, take the course and see what areas of physics interest you the most. HEP and Astro are two of the most popular areas of physics, mostly due to the fact they get the most popular science exposure, and many people head into a physics degree with one of the two in mind. However, along the way you might find an area of physics even more interesting! \n\nOne thing to bear in mind is that at each stage of a physics career, there are fewer and fewer positions available. More people do undergrad than do a masters, more people do a masters than a PhD, and most people who do a PhD in physics end up outside of academic research (often by choice, but sometimes due to the lack of jobs available). There's no guarantee that you'd be admitted to an MSc programme, even with an undergraduate degree. \n\nOverall, the chance that you'll have enough luck (and I really mean luck; it's as big a factor as skill, enthusiasm, and hard work are) to come out in the end with a permenant job in physics research is realistically very slim. However, a physics degree will teach you many things and would definitely open up a lot more options in a software-oriented career. Rather than an end goal, focus on the journey. A physics degree is tough but can be very rewarding! As long as you go into it without the expectation of a particular career path, and get enough out of the degree to warrant doing it, then that's the main thing.", "created_utc": "1643577131.0", "edited": "False", "id": "huwiqo6", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_sga0ob", "parent_id": "t3_sga0ob", "score": "3", "subreddit": "AskPhysics", "subreddit_id": "t5_2sumo"}, {"author": "astronemma", "body": "Pretty much what people have said here.

It\u2019s also a very natural response to deny that it\u2019s happening, so it\u2019s understandable that your MIL didn\u2019t want to think about it as long as she did. \n\nTo add to your summary points at the end:\n1.

Two types of astronomy primarily take place from the ground: radio and optical. Yes, telescopes like Hubble can take amazing images above the atmosphere, but they are in very high demand. You say that the cost has come down, but space-based astronomy is still magnitudes more expensive than from the ground (forgive me for not having any figures to hand, I'm a ground-based astronomer). We have a LOT of telescopes quietly chugging away on the ground, spitting out good science. The flashier space ones tend to get a lot more attention so perhaps more emphasis is put on their scientific contributions than is fair. \n\nNow, onto radio astronomy, which I'm more qualified to comment on. Radio astronomy is *hard*. It's a lot more technical than putting a CCD behind some mirrors or a lens (I realise I am being a tad reductive there). To get comparable radio resolutions to shorter wavelengths, your telescopes have to be much bigger (resolution scales with wavelength divided by diameter, and the smaller the better). Now, there's only so big you can make a single dish, but we can make use of radio interferometry. This links up multiple smaller radio telescopes, to effectively make a much larger one.

I'm a physicist; I get radio telescopes to look at distant galaxies to study their magnetic fields. But I wouldn't have a clue where to start with this, even with infinite computing power available to me. Computers are only as smart as the person programming them. And, contrary to popular belief, physicists aren't geniuses. Many of us are great at what we specifically do, but would need to put a lot of work in to understand our non-specialist areas. \n\nEither way, even if you had a physicist who specialised in a relevant field to this question, I would say no. For a start, there are many observable constants to the universe, the most well-known probably being Hubble's \"constant\", which governs the rate of the expansion of the Universe. I say \"constant\", because we don't know for certain that it's not changed over time (different methods of measuring it get statistically significantly different results, which might be a result of them probing it at different epochs). These differences, and uncertainties on this measurement and others, propagate through to uncertainties of how systems that depend on them evolve over time.\n\nLet's say that you have all of these constants nailed down precisely (unrealistic, but you're asking for a hypothetical here). The next issue is that some physics just does not have an analytical solution. Even the 'simple' (compared to your question) three body problem, where three independent objects are in motion relating to each other, has no solution. We can approximate it, sure, based on measurements. And we can do these numerical solutions really well so that you wouldn't know the difference. But those differences again introduce an uncertainty which propagates.\n\nHowever, you've said that this wonder physicist has been given a complete set of axioms. Let's say this means the constants are precisely determined and everything is modelled analytically. But is that analysis on a macro or micro level? When you get to small enough scales, things essentially just become probabilities. Could you calculate the probability of every single action or event? I feel like the scale of the numbers involved still makes it impossible, but I can't say for certain. But that's your definite endpoint, a set of probabilities for every possible evolution of the Universe. You couldn't determine which one would unfold, just as you cannot predict exactly when a radioactive atomic nucleus will decay. You can create statistical models of its average behaviour over time, but knowing the exact moment of such an event?

Sorry for being a little cranky last night. \n\n> Satellites don't produce wideband RFI however as they have narrow band filter that filters the output.\n\nIn theory, yes. In practice, not everything is filtered out and some satellite signals spill over into protected radio astronomy bands, e.g. see the signal shown here: https://public.nrao.edu/telescopes/radio-frequency-interference/\n\n\n> I expect telescopes also have narrow band amplifiers and also do not receive from a wide range of signals\n\nThis was the case historically, but upgraded electronics on new and updated telescopes can (and do) observe a wide range of frequencies at once. For example, one of the telescopes I work with is the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) which has 2048 1MHz frequency channels spanning over 2 GHz (and it can observe two of these windows at a time!). I've observed with ATCA in real time for a total of over 100 hours, and the whole time there are RFI spikes that come and go (we could deal with something persistent a lot more easily). I don't think I have ever observed at a time that there wasn't at least one source of RFI in the band. \n\n> This isn't a good analogy\n\nI beg to differ. Yes it's not the same physics, but it has the same overall effect on astronomical data. Light pollution adds contamination to optical astronomy; RFI adds contamination to radio astronomy.\n\n> Satellites emitting radio signals has already been happening for many decades. The sky is full of satellites that emit radio signals.\n\nExactly. I am saying that this is an issue. At the moment they can be dealt with. Starlink could be overwhelming. \n\n\n> Then radio astronomy is already impossible and has been for decades. Your information you're presenting here is obviously faulty in some way.\n\n\nYou know that this isn't the case. I said that a satellite *could* drown out an astronomical signal. It also can be of a similar magnitude to the astronomical signal, and they get muddled together. It's not an all-or-nothing things (it would be easier if it was, then we would know which data were bad a lot more easily). \n\n> That would imply poor engineering which is not something I would say about satellites. What known satellites leak lots of RFI? Do you have an image of such a leaky satellite compared to background starlight?\n\nPlease again refer to this: https://public.nrao.edu/telescopes/radio-frequency-interference/\n\nYour analogy to background starlight isn't how radio astronomy works. For starters, pretty much all astronomical radio emmission that we see is from galaxies, not stars. Secondly, as I have said previously, radio images aren't made from a \"point and shoot\" approach; it requires careful signal processing techniques. Contamination from RFI can manifest in many different ways during this process. It usually results in the imaging algorithm not converging, or if it does then RFI causes artefacts in the image. You don't \"see\" the satellite, you see its effect on the image. \n\n> I'm wondering how this works. The signals strength emitted at that distance from the ground would already be very weak, for it to then be reflected all the way back to the ground from the tiny surface area on the satellite would make it significantly more weak. I can't imagine this being very bright. Do you have any example satellite imagery of such a reflection compared to background starlight?\n\nI don't work with as low frequencies myself, but I have heard a few colleagues say this e.g. https://twitter.com/jr_pritchard/status/1221852393178091521\n\n> SpaceX is already providing accurate positioning data to the astronomy community from my understanding.\n\nI'm sorry but this is incorrect.

Starlink is completely overwhelming. There is no expectation, but that is due to there being no precedent set for all this yet. \n\n> SpaceX for their part has been very active with talking with the astronomy industry after the launches and the news about their visual brightness.\n\nAs someone working in the astronomy industry, I'm afraid to say that this is not the case. \n\nI hope that clears up any questions or misconceptions that you have.", "created_utc": "1589971715.0", "edited": "False", "id": "fr88r95", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_gm8jh4", "parent_id": "t1_fr7h107", "score": "1", "subreddit": "dataisbeautiful", "subreddit_id": "t5_2tk95"}, {"author": "astronemma", "body": "Apologies I came off as rude.

MicroJanskys seems small until your radio telescopes are designed to be sensitive to that level (which, to be clear, they now are). \n\nYes, you could theoretically do some cool stuff with space-based interferometry. But you would need to launch an unfeasible amount of radio telescopes to compensate for the loss of ground-based ones.

They don't detect photons like a CCD does; the radio signals cause an electrical voltage in the radio receiver. These signals are then processed (involving many calibration steps) in order to form an image. Radio telescopes pick up signals in a wide range of directions to varying degrees of sensitivity \u2014 even 90 degrees away from where they are pointing. If there is a strong radio signal in one of the so-called sidelobes (which can be 90 degrees away from the source the telescope is pointing at), it will drown out any astronomical signals. A typical telescope beam pattern: http://www.ras.ucalgary.ca/radiotel/beam1.gif\n\nUnfortunately, human-made radio signals have a much greater amplitude than astronomical ones. Radio Frequency Interference, or RFI, is to radio astronomy what light pollution is to optical astronomy. Radio telescopes have started to be built as far away from humans as possible (e.g. deserts in South Africa and Australia) in order to be in an environment with as little RFI from mobile phones etc as possible. \n\nThe one thing that your radio telescope cannot avoid, no matter where it is, are satellites. As I mentioned before, an RFI-producing satellite anywhere above the horizon could drown out an astronomical radio signal. There are two ways in which satellites can cause RFI:\n1) The communication frequencies that they emit leak out from their designated bands, and into ones supposedly protected for astronomy. \n2) They can be just as reflective of low-frequency radio waves as they are of optical light. Low-frequency radio broadcasts from Earth can be reflected off the satellites and picked up by the telescope beam.\n\nRadio astronomy is technically challenging enough without having to also loose potentially significant amounts of your data (and with the satellites still not in predictable orbits, you don't necessarily know which data are affected). Adding more satellites is the equivalent of building floodlights next to an optical observatory.\n\nSorry this all seems very pessimistic, but SpaceX have done what they have done with very little (if any) consultation with the astronomy industry.

Other than the basic physics (e.g. electromagnetism core content) I wasn't familiar with the field i work in for my PhD. Do you do a master's project in your fourth year? That was what introduced me to aspects of the field I work in now (radio astronomy & magnetic fields in galaxies). Basically: many people have imposter syndrome, and just the fact that you have made it through to your final year of a physics degree is an achievement. Fourth year is when you will really start to be able to focus on the things that interest you the most. Don't worry about having a clear direction in mind; realistically most people don't (and even if they do, can change their mind). Also don't feel like you have to go straight into the PhD from undergrad; if by the time PhD application season rolls round and you're still unsure, take a break for a year and apply once you've graduated. Try not to compare yourself to your peers and their plans, and don't think that you have to know everything before starting a PhD. It's called being a PhD student for a reason; there is still plenty to learn!", "created_utc": "1588956172.0", "edited": "False", "id": "fpw2lt8", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_gfs1fe", "parent_id": "t3_gfs1fe", "score": "3", "subreddit": "AskPhysics", "subreddit_id": "t5_2sumo"}, {"author": "astronemma", "body": "Hulme community garden centre are closed for browsing but are doing deliveries!", "created_utc": "1588682211.0", "edited": "False", "id": "fpjvno0", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_gdwpzd", "parent_id": "t3_gdwpzd", "score": "3", "subreddit": "manchester", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhjj"}, {"author": "astronemma", "body": "Thank you!", "created_utc": "1588174498.0", "edited": "False", "id": "foyl6cw", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_ga8j2j", "parent_id": "t1_foyebga", "score": "1", "subreddit": "LegalAdviceUK", "subreddit_id": "t5_32g6u"}, {"author": "astronemma", "body": "Thank you!", "created_utc": "1588174478.0", "edited": "False", "id": "foyl4v5", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_ga8j2j", "parent_id": "t1_foy41a4", "score": "2", "subreddit": "LegalAdviceUK", "subreddit_id": "t5_32g6u"}, {"author": "astronemma", "body": "We are in England.", "created_utc": "1588163450.0", "edited": "False", "id": "foy2677", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_ga8j2j", "parent_id": "t3_ga8j2j", "score": "2", "subreddit": "LegalAdviceUK", "subreddit_id": "t5_32g6u"}, {"author": "astronemma", "body": "THAT POSTER!

Beyond that, we don\u2019t really know what causes them, so having an increasing number of them will help us pin this down. \n\nOne possibility is that they are given off from astronomically cataclysmic events (think of something like a supernova \n explosion). However, there was one FRB that repeated \u2014 it came from the same place in the sky. Does it have the same physical origin as the other FRBs (each single pulse looks the same)? Or is it something else entirely? Now that we\u2019ve seen two repeaters and we know the first isn\u2019t an anomaly (plus, there are other similarities between the two repeaters), we can start to pin down the potential causes of them. \n\nAnd sorry no, not aliens. They\u2019re coming from all over the sky, so unless there are multiple alien civilisations that have independently developed the same technology, then it\u2019s not an artificial signal. There is an astrophysical explanation, we just don\u2019t know what it is yet. \n\nEdit: super nice -> supernova ", "created_utc": "1547151196.0", "edited": "False", "id": "edqo01c", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_aeliw6", "parent_id": "t1_edqjkhb", "score": "193", "subreddit": "Astronomy", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhor"}, {"author": "astronemma", "body": "Anyone who thinks they know how to write Doctor Who better than the writers needs to read the Writer\u2019s Tale.

[Anyons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anyon) arise when you look at the area between Fermi\u2013Dirac and Bose\u2013Einstein statistics -- which is something you can do when considering the physics in two dimensions (the maths is in the anyon article I linked if you're so inclined).

I did Physics with Astrophysics (probably similar to majoring in physics and minoring in astrophysics?), at an institute that does a lot of radio astronomy research. For my final year I had to do a research project, and ended up working on observations of a nearby spiral galaxy.

The UK is pretty good for vegan food.

The main supermarkets are still reasonable for those things though, and unless it's a tiny convenience store will have a range of vegan alternatives. Tescos, Morrisons, Sainsbury's etc always have at least soya milk, even in their smaller stores. And if there's something more specific you're after, Holland &amp; Barrett is a health food store that sells things you can't find elsewhere. Hope you enjoy! \n\nEdit: in terms of budget, I spend around \u00a320 a week on food.

The constant has a negative pressure equal to its energy density, causing the accelerated expansion. In this hypothesis, there would be no concentration of this constant - it's just a fundamental property of the universe. \n\nThe cosmological constant is part of the standard cosmology I learnt in undergrad (the Lambda-CDM model). However, there is also the theory of [Quintessence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quintessence_(physics), in which the observed acceleration of expansion is caused by the potential energy of a dynamical field, i.e. one that can vary in space and time.

It's not a force that repels galaxies, it's a lack of force to attract them. [This Forbes article](https://www.forbes.com/sites/startswithabang/2017/02/04/ask-ethan-if-gravity-attracts-how-can-the-dipole-repeller-push-the-milky-way) explains it pretty well, but before I found that I started to write my own analogy: \n\nImagine you're standing in the middle of an equally-spaced circle of people, with each person holding a rope, and the other ends of the ropes being tied to you. If they all pull with an equal amount of force, they all cancel each other out and you don't move anywhere. If one person were to leave the circle, leaving a gap in their place, then you no longer have the force from them pulling you towards them. The overall force now acts in the direction opposite to where they were standing. You get pulled away from the gap - it seems like it has repelled you. It's a pseudo force, analogous to centrifugal force. \n\nThe \"Dipole Repeller\" is simply an underdensity, i.e. a relative void in matter. To quote the original Nature letter, \"When describing the gravitational dynamics in co-moving coordinates, by which the expansion of the Universe is factored out, underdensities repel and overdensities attract.\"\n", "created_utc": "1490353025.0", "edited": "1490353854.0", "id": "dfcg12s", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_616jl1", "parent_id": "t3_616jl1", "score": "4", "subreddit": "askscience", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qm4e"}, {"author": "astronemma", "body": "I need to dust my laptop screen... good work!", "created_utc": "1490350557.0", "edited": "False", "id": "dfcf5no", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_61697v", "parent_id": "t3_61697v", "score": "1", "subreddit": "astrophotography", "subreddit_id": "t5_2raop"}, {"author": "astronemma", "body": "If you have any animal shelters near you, it might be worth seeing if they have any piggies to adopt.

No space is empty; even from a fundamental particle physics perspective things are popping into and out of existence all the time. From an astrophysical perspective, the term \"interstellar medium\" is what we use to describe the matter that can be found in between star systems (gas, ions, atoms, molecules etc). \n\nIf a photon from that star reaches us here on Earth, then that particular photon hasn't been obstructed by anything. But there could've been others that were - we can observe something without all of the light from it reaching us. In general, the light has probably been attenuated somewhat, with the magnitude of this depending on what it has passed through. Think of it like seeing headlights through fog - you can still see them, but some of the light has been scattered and/or absorbed. \n\nOne thing to note is this attenuation is dependent on the wavelength of the light. Something that is obscured when say, looking in the optical range of wavelengths, may be entirely visible in the infrared. For example, you can actually use radio telescopes when it's cloudy, as radio waves aren't absorbed by clouds. This is partly why we use a range of different telescopes to look at astrophysical objects at a range of frequencies.
