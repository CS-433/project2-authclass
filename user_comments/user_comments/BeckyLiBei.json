And trying to interact with your teachers is problematic when you can't speak.  Also, the majority of students studying Chinese have cringe-worthy pronunciation, and they don't seem aware; they need long-term practice.\n\nI wouldn't encourage foregoing speaking entirely---your weakest link is going to require the most time mending, and become a bottleneck in the future.

(Assuming we're not counting dictionary apps like Pleco.)\n\n2. Skritter I used for a few months years ago when preparing for a (handwritten) exam (it's too expensive, so I don't use it anymore).  Dong Chinese I used for about a year, also when preparing for an exam.  I sporadically still use it (maybe once every few days), but it's less useful for me now that I'm not focused on improving my vocabulary.  [In my opinion, useful apps tend to make themselves obsolete by efficiently teaching you everything it can.]\n\n   iTalki is different, since all it does is put you in contact with teachers; the app itself basically doesn't help you learn.

Skritter is for Chinese handwriting practice, and is useful for when I don't have pen and paper handy (like on the subway).  It helped a bit with handwriting.  I mostly used Dong Chinese for watching media and tracking my vocabulary; I uploaded HSK-related media and use it for study.  It was helpful for making sure I got enough exposure to HSK words.  All apps are a \"drop in the ocean\" when it comes to learning a language---I've spent literally thousands of hours studying Chinese.  iTalki is different: the app didn't help me learn Chinese, the teachers did---iTalki was especially helpful for my oral Chinese.\n\n   I'm planning on taking the HSK6 on Sunday (2 days from now); my reading, vocabulary, and grammar is strong (C1+), my writing is decent (high B2), and my oral and listening is okay (B2).\n\n4. While I learn things like vocabulary on iTalki, again it's not the app, it's my teacher.  In any case, I mostly learn by myself, without apps.\n\n5. [+6.] I paid for Skritter (temporarily) and Dong Chinese.  Skritter is just too expensive, especially when TOFU Learn (and pen and paper) exists.  Dong Chinese feels worth it to me.  I tend to wait until Black Friday to save money.  I've spent quite a lot on iTalki, but I'm not paying for an app: I'm after the teachers; I've also had teachers outside of iTalki.  \n\n7. For Chinese, I'd recommend the HSK Standard Course textbooks; thousands of students have been successful with these textbooks.  Most apps (95%+) are utter rubbish and just want your money.  Duolingo for Chinese is underdeveloped (I hear it's better for other languages).  iTalki is a great way to access teachers (and multiple teachers at the same time), and you can easily change teachers if you have problems---I'd recommend it.  Skritter has an amazingly smooth interface, which makes practicing fun.  Beyond that, there's not much benefit.  (If you're wealthy, Skritter is a reasonable choice for Chinese handwriting practice.)  I feel Dong Chinese is definitely worth it---you can tell it was designed by someone who is actually leaning Chinese.\n\n9. Dong Chinese helped a bit with motivation, because I could see my progress in a plot.  At the same time, I ended up wasting time important content into Dong Chinese, rather than just studying it directly.  Skritter is just something to do on the subway or something, when you need to wait; it's not motivating.  Teachers on iTalki often help with motivation, especially since I have a range of different teachers.", "created_utc": "1665709515.0", "edited": "False", "id": "is8ca3z", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_y34h2u", "parent_id": "t3_y34h2u", "score": "2", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "BeckyLiBei", "body": "This is what I mean when I say my Chinese is \"B2-C1\", even though CEFR doesn't directly apply to Chinese.", "created_utc": "1665705720.0", "edited": "False", "id": "is83wky", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_y2yyxi", "parent_id": "t1_is7oe1u", "score": "2", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "BeckyLiBei", "body": "I'm guessing, if anything, second-language learning will become more popular when computer translation begins to surpass human translation (like what happened with chess).

It's hard!  I remember the first news article I read took me a full day.  1 article = 1 day's worth of study.\n\nHowever, if you read articles about the same topic (narrow reading) you'll reuse the same vocabulary over and over.  Over time, I could read articles about my first topic (COVID) faster and faster.\n\nThe other point is that news in Chinese has a very rigid structure, and once you're familiar with the structures that might arise, it's much easier.  Often it's something like [30 characters of introduction] + [name] + said + [quote what they said].  And that can be a whole paragraph.  And after a while, you realize what you're reading is just a university name or a research institute, and don't need to pay too much attention (it's not going to affect the meaning).\n\nReading non-fiction is much easier than fiction.  Non-fiction is consistent with reality (so you can use your background knowledge), and avoids a lot of flowery words.  A lot of scientific words are direct translations from English (e.g. \u9ed1\u6d1e = \"black hole\").  Thus news is much easier than novels.\n\nI wouldn't bother with flashcards, and just read 10 news articles about the same topic (the repeated vocabulary is your de facto flashcard system), and just be aware that the first few are going to be incredibly hard.

I\u2019m a native speaker and a Chinese language instructor, and I was typing on a computer, so obviously there couldn\u2019t be any blatant grammatical or spelling errors.

I found my marks were reasonably estimated by this mock exam (except the writing section---they just give me 65 regardless of anything else); the questions are very much like what are on the actual exam.  Since you take the mock exam on your home computer, you can use video recording software to record the whole exam, and show your teacher the writing section.\n\nThe mock exam shows how many characters you've used; I'm guessing the real exam is the same format.

(I.e., you could turn on a C-Drama and follow the characters dialogue without subtitles.)\n\nThe problem with dramas is that they're so boring.  I don't understand them because I cannot focus my attention on them.  I prefer to learn something, but with e.g. science-related YouTube videos, they talk so fast about technical topics, so I can't easily keep up.  Most of the time, I can go to the cinemas and understand the movie, but they always have subtitles.  Talking with teachers is easy enough, but maybe they tailor their language to my ear.  Talking with random people is sometimes extremely hard, and sometimes no problem at all.  It depends on how crisp their Putonghua is (and how patient they are, and how much slang they use).  It took me over 15 years to reach this level, but most of it was achieved in the last 3.\n\n> (2) What did your study routine consist of to get you to that point? What exercises/activities were you doing? How many hours a week were you dedicating to it?\n\nThis changes all the time.  Recently I've been taking an iTalki class every morning.  It's made a big difference.  I think being able to speak more has improved my listening---if I've managed to output something, it's likely solidified in my mind.  So having iTalki teachers that let me speak more has helped.  Also I don't get distracted talking with a teacher.\n\nI sometimes listen to YouTube videos, but I don't think they're of huge benefit.  I worry it'll just train me to think of recordings as \"background noise\".", "created_utc": "1663892196.0", "edited": "1663892410.0", "id": "ipjfs5b", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_xkwzdf", "parent_id": "t3_xkwzdf", "score": "2", "subreddit": "ChineseLanguage", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qyz1"}, {"author": "BeckyLiBei", "body": "\u6211\u559c\u6b22\u770b\u8fd9\u4e2a\u9891\u9053\u7684\u89c6\u9891\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e2a\u4eba\u7269\u53eb\u201cCaptain Disillusion\u201d\u3002\u7528\u4e2d\u6587\u8bf4\u51fa\u8fd9\u4e2a\u540d\u5b57\u7684\u610f\u601d\u6709\u70b9\u96be\u3002\u201cCaptain\u201d\u8fd9\u4e2a\u5355\u8bcd\u5c31\u662f\u961f\u957f\uff08\u6b63\u5982\u201c\u7f8e\u56fd\u961f\u957f\u201d\u91cc\u7684\u961f\u957f\uff09\u3002\u201cillusion\u201d\u5c31\u662f\u5e7b\u89c9\uff08\u540d\u8bcd\uff09\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u52a0\u4e2a\u524d\u7f00\u201cdis\u201d\u7684\u5355\u8bcd\u201cdisillusion\u201d\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u52a8\u8bcd\uff0c\u610f\u601d\u662f\u4f7f\u4eba\u4e0d\u53d7\u5e7b\u89c9\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u6240\u4ee5\u8fd9\u4e2a\u4eba\u7269\u662f\u201c\u4f7f\u4eba\u4e0d\u53d7\u5e7b\u89c9\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u961f\u957f\u201d\u3002\u7528\u82f1\u8bed\u8bf4\u4ed6\u7684\u540d\u5b57\u542c\u8d77\u6765\u6bd4\u8f83\u6d41\u5229\u3002\n\n\u5728\u4ed6\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u91cc\uff0c\u4ed6\u5206\u6790\u70ed\u95e8\u7684\u7f51\u7edc\u89c6\u9891\u3002\u6240\u6709\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u5177\u6709\u4e00\u4e2a\u7279\u5f81\uff1a\u5b83\u4eec\u770b\u8d77\u6765\u4e0d\u771f\u5b9e\uff0c\u666e\u901a\u4eba\u6000\u7591\u5b83\u4eec\u88ab\u67d0\u79cd\u8f6f\u4ef6\u6539\u53d8\u4e86\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u4e0d\u80fd\u8bc1\u660e\u81ea\u5df1\u7684\u731c\u6d4b\u3002\u8fd9\u4e2a\u9891\u9053\u7684\u4e3b\u4eba\u64c5\u957f\u89c6\u9891\u7f16\u8f91\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u7ed9\u5927\u5bb6\u89e3\u91ca\u4eba\u600e\u4e48\u80fd\u591f\u91cd\u590d\u5b9e\u73b0\u540c\u6837\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002\n\n\u636e\u6211\u4e86\u89e3\uff0c\u4ed6\u5728\u6bcf\u4e00\u4e2a\u89c6\u9891\u6253\u626e\u5f97\u50cf\u4e00\u4e2a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\uff0c\u4eff\u4f5b\u4ed6\u60f3\u8981\u5047\u88c5\u4ed6\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u771f\u6b63\u7684\u4eba\u3002\u8fd9\u4e2a\u4eba\u7269\u5047\u88c5\u4ed6\u662f\u4e2a\u771f\u6b63\u7684\u4eba\u5c31\u50cf\u4ed6\u5206\u6790\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u5047\u88c5\u4ed6\u662f\u4e2a\u771f\u6b63\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u3002\n\n\u5176\u5b9e\uff0c\u4ed6\u5206\u6790\u7684\u5927\u90e8\u5206\u89c6\u9891\u91cc\u5c31\u662f\u540c\u6837\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u4f60\u9996\u5148\u62cd\u80cc\u666f\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u6ca1\u6709\u79fb\u52a8\u6444\u50cf\u673a\u5730\u62cd\u6709\u4eba\u7269\u7684\u89c6\u9891\uff08\u6bd4\u5982\u4e00\u4e2a\u4eba\u7ad9\u5728\u6905\u5b50\u4e0a\uff09\uff0c\u6700\u540e\u7528\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5220\u6389\u89c6\u9891\u91cc\u7684\u4ec0\u4e48\u5143\u7d20\uff0c\u6216\u8005\u66f4\u7cbe\u786e\u5730\u8bf4\uff0c\u7528\u201c\u80cc\u666f\u201d\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u66ff\u4ee3\u8fd9\u4e2a\u5143\u7d20\uff08\u6bd4\u5982\u6905\u5b50\uff09\u3002\u4f60\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u4e1d\u4e0d\u82df\u5730\u9009\u62e9\u5149\u4eae\uff0c\u5426\u5219\u89c6\u9891\u91cc\u6709\u5f88\u591a\u96be\u4ee5\u6539\u53d8\u7684\u5f71\u5b50\u3002\n\n\u6bcf\u4e00\u4e2a\u89c6\u9891\uff0c\u4ed6\u8bf4\u51fa\u4e00\u53e5\u8bdd\uff1a\u201c\u7528\u5fc3\u7231\u4e0a\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u6240\u6709\u522b\u7684\u4e8b\u60c5\uff0c\u5c31\u7528\u4f60\u7684\u8111\u5b50\u201d\u3002", "created_utc": "1663844067.0", "edited": "1663844350.0", "id": "ipgarkn", "is_submitter": "True", "link_id": "t3_xk2wbg", "parent_id": "t3_xk2wbg", "score": "2", "subreddit": "kantuxiehua", "subreddit_id": "t5_6s0ej3"}, {"author": "BeckyLiBei", "body": "I don't think this is especially common.

During my PhD I got to know a couple of researchers at Nankai, and we ended up collaborating on a whole lot of papers over the years since then.  I'd spend a fair portion of my year in China.\n\n- In 2014, I moved to China with a job at Nankai.  In 2019, I ended up leaving and came to Beijing to see if I could find a job here.  Unfortunately COVID hit, and everything was turned upside down.  Having no job (and no idea if I could even apply for a job) and living in China, I decided to commit to studying Chinese.\n\n- Without proper study, my Chinese ended up around mid/late-HSK4 (in late 2019, after ~14 years).  After deciding to properly study, I finished off the HSK4, and nowadays, i.e., 3 years of full-time study later, I'm preparing for the HSK6 (again; I failed in March).\n\nHow long did it take me to have a smooth conversation?  It depends what counts.  Even now, not every conversation I have is \"smooth\".  But I feel at the HSK4 level, I could manage to say most basic things with help and breaks etc.  Nowadays, it's more like I can say the same thing in 5 different ways without major grammar mistakes, but I don't know which is best.  I can also use precise words here and there.\n\nMy tips?  Heavily prioritize vocabulary (read a lot---millions of characters!), then prioritize fluency.  Get your reading to the level where everything is \"comprehensible input\".  First \"theory\", then \"practice\".  First \"breadth\", then \"depth\".  When you reach a higher level, go back and fix the bugs in the \"easy\" content (which likely appears hundreds or thousands of times more frequently).", "created_utc": "1663715620.0", "edited": "1663716009.0", "id": "ip9deyk", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_xj32er", "parent_id": "t3_xj32er", "score": "3", "subreddit": "ChineseLanguage", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qyz1"}, {"author": "BeckyLiBei", "body": "There's quite a number of sites with comparable lists of emojis with their names in your TL.

In this research note, I will recount how I set up an experimental method of masturbating to *shota* comics, and how this participant observation of my own desire not only gave me a more embodied understanding of the topic for my research but also made me think about loneliness and ways to combat it as driving forces of the culture of self-published erotic comics.\n\nI was wondering if he'd make puns in the paper:\n\n> And so I realized that my body was equipped with a research tool of its own that could give me, quite literally, a first-hand understanding of *shota*.", "created_utc": "1660278154.0", "edited": "1660278384.0", "id": "ijyd40d", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_wm2rcx", "parent_id": "t1_ijxiaic", "score": "1", "subreddit": "iamatotalpieceofshit", "subreddit_id": "t5_3jj03"}, {"author": "BeckyLiBei", "body": ">For how long have you been learning languages?\n\nI started learning Chinese in 2005, so perhaps 17 years now.

My oral Chinese still needs work, but it's decent.\n\n>Are you satisfied with your progress?\n\nI prepared for the HSK6, which led to significant leaps in my reading skills.  Nowadays, I'm getting into the swing of things with iTalki, and I'm amazed how quickly my oral Chinese is improving (something that's been lagging for years).  And yes, I'm thrilled.\n\n>What's your favorite method/exercise to study?\n\nRecently I've started studying high-school textbooks.  It meshes well with iTalki classes, because my teachers have learned this content in high school (unlike, say, HSK textbooks).  They seem to love talking about these topics; maybe it makes them nostalgic.  I'm finding this combination of methods quite effective.\n\n>What has language learning brought you?\n\nI live in China now.

Down the line, you choose another topic (my second topic was the Trump vs. Biden election) then another topic, until you no longer need narrow reading.\n\nUsing narrow reading, I was actually surprised how early I could start reading newspapers.

The HSK wordlists have been criticized as being too literary...\n\nI heard similar criticism before embarking on the HSK6 journey.  I feel there is another side to this story:\n\n- When studying for the HSK6, you also need to know many \u8d85\u7eb2\u8bcd (words outside the syllabus).  You don't just master the 5000 HSK words and that's it.\n\n- Following the HSK syllabus also means there is a lot study materials available, and it's easier to find a teacher with relevant expertise and preparation.\n\n- As our reading and listening improves, we receive an increasing volume of increasingly difficult input.  In this way, we encounter the HSK vocabulary.\n\n- If your goal is to read literature, then \"being too literary\" is not a problem.\n\nNevertheless, the HSK6 workload is intense.  And there's very little practical benefit of a HSK6 certificate over a HSK5 certificate.  I just want to point out that there are both pros and cons here.", "created_utc": "1646479990.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hzfwogg", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_t6s9o4", "parent_id": "t1_hzfthmu", "score": "2", "subreddit": "ChineseLanguage", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qyz1"}, {"author": "BeckyLiBei", "body": "I'm currently preparing for the HSK6 in 3 weeks time; it is truly one of the most stressful times in my whole life.\n\n- Vocabulary, vocabulary, vocabulary.  People say you need to know 5000 words, but I would estimate that in reality you need a (passive) vocabulary of 15000+ words.  The 5000 HSK words need to be studied in-depth: you need to know precisely what meanings they have and don't have (and how they're used, collocations, etc.).  My advice is to prioritize learning the HSK vocabulary above all else: afterwards, the learning process is faster because you absorb more due to fewer dictionary lookups.  I also recommend looking up words in a Chinese-Chinese dictionary, so you don't have to waste time comparing the differences between English and Chinese words.  Pay attention to efficiency: mere seconds wasted when multiplied by the 2500 HSK6 words add up quickly.\n\n- Read lots.  I'd say 1 million characters of input is the bare minimum; 10 million characters of input is more reasonable.  Reading speed and accuracy greatly affect your score in all three sections of the HSK6.  (This also benefits your vocabulary.)  [Note: progress is not linear---your reading speed increases significantly over time, resulting in being able to consume far more input.]\n\n- Listen lots.  I suggest having headphones and listening materials continuously at hand.  In particular, repeatedly listen to example sentences containing HSK vocabulary (such as from [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhY8qKWhJh8) or [Mandarin Corner](https://mandarincorner.org/) or the [Tingli Anki deck](https://ankiweb.net/shared/decks/Tingli)).  (This also benefits your vocabulary.)\n\n- Learn Chinese history.  Many questions involved Chinese historical events, figures, items, etc., and it's assumed you are familiar with all this.\n\n- Count your study hours.  I use the Toggl app to do this, but there are many other productivity apps around.  In my experience, 500 hours of study makes a noticeable difference.\n\nAnd also consider the choice between handwritten and computer tests.  Both options have their pros and cons: I'm taking the handwritten exam.  However, if you want to do the handwritten exam, you'll need to practice handwriting over a long period of time.

YouTube videos like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhY8qKWhJh8) and [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G6jWN0PzDI) can assist (consider downloading them via youtube-dl and converting them to mp3s to play on headphones so you can listen while e.g. doing housework).  Consider getting a Chinese-Chinese dictionary so you know what the words actually mean (not just know their closest English words---you need depth of knowledge at the HSK6 level).  E.g., many words like \u5fcc\u8bb3 (\"taboo\") and \u7231\u597d (\"hobby\") function in ways that their English counterparts don't.\n\nGo through the *HSK6 Standard Course* textbooks (using YouTube videos and the [Chinese Zero to Hero](https://chinesezerotohero.teachable.com/courses/enrolled/559834) materials as supplements).

It's important to write things down on a piece of paper, so you don't have to memorize a zillion bits of information.  Note you're given 5 minutes after the listening section to fill in the answers (although maybe this is only for the handwritten version).\n\n- The general advice for the reading section is to work backwards (from the 4-th part to the 1-st part), as this helps with timing.  Consider blindly guessing for the \u8bed\u75c5 (\"faulty wording\") section to save time for the other sections (or just focus on easily identifiable errors like double negatives \u9632\u6b62\u2026\u2026\u4e0d\u518d\u53d1\u751f); recently I've been trying to [tabulate the \"faulty wording\" examples in the available exams](https://chinese.stackexchange.com/q/50538/8099), and I keep finding native Chinese speakers (without a time limit, with access to the Internet) getting them wrong, or just simply declaring they don't know.  This is not easy.\n\n- The second part of the reading section requires familiarity with the HSK6 vocabulary, and in particular differences between synonyms and collocations.  I find the third part of the reading section tricky, as you need to pay attention to subtle details as to why or why not a sentence part can fit in a gap.  The fourth part is about searching for answers in a text: there's not enough time to read them in full---with practice, you get fast at this.  I tend to make sure to read the first and last sentences to get some idea what the article is about.  If you're asked for a \u6807\u9898 (title) mostly you want to choose the option that is mentioned in every paragraph (but there are exceptions).\n\n- For the writing section, reading speed and accuracy is critical.

(I'm guessing there's no one-size-fits-all answer here.)\n\n> Is it normal to have enough points to pass the Listening section of HSK, but still struggle to follow along with what was said?\n\nYes.

Getting 80%+ is much harder than a 60%.\n\n> Is there anything in particular you did to improve Listening comprehension? (e.g. focussing more on audio-ONLY without subtitles or something)\n\nFor the HSK5, there's a relatively small number of topics they talk about, and their forms of expressions are limited.  If you do lots of practice exams etc., you'll start predicting what they're talking about, the moral of the story, etc., because you've seen similar content before.  You also get used to what you can and can't ignore, and can predict the upcoming questions.  This helps significantly: it doesn't feel unfamiliar.  (I'm fairly sure the same is true for earlier HSKs, but my first HSK was HSK5.)\n\nFor the HSK6, my teacher went through the 2500 HSK6 vocabulary items and said aloud a sentence containing the word.  I repeated back the sentence (if I could), and repeatedly practiced the words I had trouble with.  Nowadays, I can almost always hear HSK words correctly.  (In my mind, this was flat-out the most useful exercise for improving my listening.)\n\nHowever, when I hear a fast-paced HSK6 snippet, I still struggle.  While I can hear individual words correctly, I can't piece together their meaning quickly enough.  I particularly struggle with topics I'm not familiar with, like business, Chinese medicine, architecture, law.\n\nOn a more practical note, I bought good quality headphones, and always have listening material at hand.

It's amazing how quickly you can go through a textbook if you already know the vocabulary, and don't always have to look things up.  So I suggest preparing a vocabulary list (e.g. that from your textbook) and making sure you get multiple exposures (both reading and listening) to each word.

In this sense, I feel it could be useful, especially if you read it aloud.  (It may also make it easier for dictionary lookups, and having already-segmentated sentences and proper nouns in capitals would make reading easier.)\n\nUsing this method for improving vocabulary feels incomplete to me.

Down the line, this may lead to the feeling of plateauing since you'll need to spend time on words you already consider \"known\".\n\nThe other issue is that many Chinese characters have meaningful components (such as phonetic components), which means you have to rely more on memorization.  (E.g., today I encountered the word \u67ab\u53f6 (\"maple leaf\").  I've never seen the character \u67ab before, but I (correctly) guessed it's pronounced the same as \u98ce.)\n\nI use a \"minimal pinyin\" approach: only add the pinyin if and only if you don't know how to pronounce the character.

Learning Chinese is a marathon, and people who start off well still may \"hit the wall\": progress at the start is obvious (\"I went from knowing no words to 100 words!\"), but the same progress later on looks rather different (\"I went from knowing 800 words, to knowing 900 words.\").\n\nWhen losing motivation, it can help to identify precisely where the problem lies, this way you can target the problem areas.  This is my current problem:\n\n1. \"My listening is not good enough.\"  What do I do?  Simply \"listen more\" is not really helpful (this always applies), especially at higher levels when there are so many words: I might not encounter my weak points despite months of untargeted listening.\n\n2. \"The words on this list I do not hear correctly.\"  Now I know precisely what to target: I can download example sentences, turn them into mp3s, and listen to them over and over.  It's much more efficient.\n\nBeyond this, sometimes when I'm feeling demotivated and know I'm not going to work, I find ways to distract myself using Chinese.  E.g. I watch [this YouTube channel about movies](https://www.youtube.com/c/%E5%A4%A7%E8%81%AA%E7%9C%8B%E7%94%B5%E5%BD%B1).  Or, if I can't do anything useful, I try to get good sleep and prepare for something for the morning.\n\nBeyond that, mixing up your study methods can spice things up.  Also motivating is finding things that were \"hard\" but are now \"not so hard\" (kept your old textbooks?).  Having a concrete \"road map\" also helps me (\"these are my goals; this is how I'll achieve them; it'll take this long\").\n\nProgress is best measured in hours of study.

Learning Chinese is a marathon, and tracking known characters and words is one way to maintain motivation.  Note that one's definition of \"known\" develops over time.\n\n> Q2 - If yes, how do I distinguish between words that are only one character, and a character? Do they count as both a word and a character? Only one?\n\nE.g. \u6211 is a word and a character.  These are separate statistics.  Tracking characters is more practical since \"what is a word\" is not easily answered (e.g. are \u661f\u671f\u4e00 and \u661f\u671f\u4e8c two different words?  \u4e1c\u8fb9 and \u4e1c\u9762?

Once you've seen 3000 characters, it takes effort to even see new (previously unseen) characters.\n\n> Q3 - Would people recommend putting characters + words in different organized \"categories\" in my Pleico vocab bank, or is that unnecessary?

Currently there's HSK1 through HSK6.  HSK4 through HSK6 are used for admission into universities, etc., in China.  My impression is that people who live in China and study Chinese full time typically reach HSK4 after 1 year, HSK5 after 2 years (in total), and HSK6 after 4 years (in total).  However, I'm yet to encounter anyone who's progressed linearly from 0 to HSK6.\n\nThe current HSK is criticized for a range of reasons, notably for not having a oral Chinese portion (so there are people who pass these tests but cannot speak), and because you can \"game\" it (i.e., optimize your marks via mastering test-taking tactics, not via learning Chinese).  There are good reasons for the upcoming reform.\n\nHSK5 is advanced in the sense that few people get to this level (I'm not intending to be immodest here; I think this is objectively true---Chinese is hard!).  But there's no guarantee that someone who has passed the HSK5 is fantastic at... well... any aspect of Chinese.\n\nFor me in particular... no-one really thinks I'm a HSK5-level student.  I mostly took the test for the experience and motivation.  Realistically, I'm mid/late-HSK6 nowadays.  I'm somewhere in the realm of B2-C1 using the European system.\n\nPractically, I can have meaningful conversations on a good day about a familiar topic.  Get me on a bad day, and talk about e.g. finance and I'll be useless.  When I talk with friends, they say they're not slowing down for me, but get me away from cleanly pronounced standard Mandarin and I'm lost.  (I actually complement Chinese people on their Chinese nowadays.)  News is still far too intense for me to comprehend without \"cheating\" in some way.  It's not a big struggle to read newspapers (which I do most days), and I sometimes read adult, non-translated novels.  Fiction is still very challenging.  Writing seems to be my strength; I'm guessing it's partly because I wrote [a short story](https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&pid=sites&srcid=ZGVmYXVsdGRvbWFpbnxyZWJlY2NhanN0b25lc3xneDoxNzdmMWE4N2NmNWFlZThm) when I was back at HSK4; I enjoy writing in Chinese.  My handwriting is decent.\n\nWith the current (pre-reform) HSK, I consider HSK1 through HSK4 as beginner, and HSK5 and HSK6 as intermediate.
