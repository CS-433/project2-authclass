For example I\u2019m a sexual abuse victim and this trauma has unfortunately festered into my fantasy. Not going into details but the point is the porn I watch at times contains things I\u2019d never want to try.\n\nAnyhow I agree with some of the other posters here.

People choose not to, people choose to keep gyms open, bars and restaurants packed, trams and busses packed, filled with massless people etc. The amount of massless people is dystopian to me.\n\nOther rich privileges include having tax funded cleaning of their apartments. Yes, you need to spend money to get money in circulation but this is going on while health personnel or workers in elderly care or teachers or police are paid horribly. So Sweden would rather funnel money to clean rich people\u2019s homes than to invest in necessary infrastructure. The tons of tax money richer people have isn\u2019t really obtained as tons of tax money as you put it, Sweden\u2019s stock and value tax is very low, so wealthy people generally get a very lenient tax here compared to other countries.

The fine is a salary based percentage cut, but the max amount of the salary cut is so low she barely notices the fine. One set of privilege for the rich, another set of privilege for the poor.
