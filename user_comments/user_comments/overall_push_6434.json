And no other language has the \"tsu\"/\u3064 sound except Japanese. Untrained non-natives can't even distinguish the sound from it's closest approximant in their own native language which is \"su\" most of the time.

The only way that people would start using Hindi on an academic level is if it was made mandatory in India. But here comes the problem, even if 48% speaks Hindi in India what about the other 52%? Probably not every language comunity would like this decision. Personally, I would just move out of the country because I'm not that good at Hindi.\n\n Another solution could be to mandate the local languages of each state at colleges and universities. But that would be another national pandemic.\n\n\n Firstly because of lack of standardization in these languages. India has a lot of problems with standardization, especially in upper grades where a lot of technical terms are used. You would see books using different terms for the same thing. For many local languages the terminologies can  change a lot between different books and sometimes even in the same book. Now that wouldn't be a problem if the textbooks the government provides didn't contain multiple words referring the same thing. It's not that a big problem though, that people would just stop using these languages but it's just one of the inconveniences that you face using local languages. \n\n\nSecondly, inability to access international content or content from other states. Most of the good stuff are written by people who don't speak your language. If Indian languages get importance in academic fields it would largely limit student's access to good content. Personally, If I just think about all the good resources that I have encountered for my college, most of them were written by people who don't speak my language and they were written in English. \n \n\n For the last point, it would reduce job prospects to a large degree. Indians dream of working in MNCs and American companies. Think Sundar Pichai and Satya Nadella and all other Indian CEOs. English increases job prospects.
