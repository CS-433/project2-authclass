Body and fitness level is never the same\n\nmy tummy will never be taut after having stretched the skin so much during my pregnancy, but it never was taut to be begin with. a few weeks ago, i finally became able to sprint at my full max without springing a leak. that was when i finally felt like i had my body back. overall fitness level, i just have to feel safe going to the gym again, and then i can work on lifting until i'm back to where i was pre-pandemic. but TBH, i'm thrilled with my current condition because i am doing way better than i ever expected my over-40 postpartum body would be. people are noticing that i'm in good shape. feels good, man.\n\nand now that i think about it, going back to part A, my husband is noticing my fitter, healthier body, and he is a little \"perkier\" than before, so I guess that's an improvement in that camp.", "created_utc": "1661271242.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ilh0tnw", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_wvfyb2", "parent_id": "t3_wvfyb2", "score": "4", "subreddit": "fitpregnancy", "subreddit_id": "t5_372t2"}, {"author": "InfernalWedgie", "body": "2x1 double whole-grilled onions, no sauce, with ketchup.
