You could just attack move and absolutely shred your opponent if they didn\u2019t have the proper countering units.

If the other player tried to engage, the infestors would fungal and let the broods decimate the army. The point here is this playstyle stifles any response and growth from the opponent, dragging the game into a boring stalemate until someone made a mistake.

For what you\u2019re spending vs what the protoss is spending in that engagement, protoss can pick up a lot of expensive units without investing a lot compared to the terran (did i also mention that adepts. don\u2019t. fucking. die?).\n\nLet\u2019s say you get into mass air. Okay. Vikings, ravens, etc. You\u2019ve shut down the first 5 or 6 tempests and you have a little breathing room. At this point, I\u2019ll bet you a beer that toss is massing carriers, and, as we know about terran\u2019s absolutely *phenomenal* late game, you\u2019re on a timer before toss just a moves and cleans house with the golden armada. \n\nPersonally, I haven\u2019t tried battle mech against toss.

This is gg at this point. Zerg is on 70+ workers, 4 bases, has better tech, econ, army value.  \n\n\nOkay, let's get down to business. I'll do my best to adjust my response so that you won't be overwhelmed by information.\n\n  \nBefore we begin, the summary of the replay was that the zerg simply had better macro. Nydus ultra was really the icing on the cake, since the game was pretty much over at 10 minutes. The struggle playing against Z is the fact that you're on a timer to kill the Z before they get too big. \n\n  \nFirst and foremost, to address your point regarding not attacking early enough due to army size, the biggest problem here is that you're not spending your money. Sc2 is a game about spending your money as best as you can. If you don't spend your money, you won't have units, tech, or economy; it doesn't matter how much ahead you are economically if you don't have the units to show for it. The biggest \"solution\" here is to either add more gates or get a robo/stargate. If you ever find yourself holding on to more than 400 minerals or so with everything you have producing/on cooldown, drop down a couple gateways (stop at 12 or so). Remember to spend your money every time the warp gates come off cooldown. This is incredibly important.  \n\n\nSecondly, your forge was a little too early and cut into the timing of your natural. You generally want that natural up and running ASAP (with exceptions, but we're going to pretend like they don't exist for now). Double forge upgrades should start before 6 minutes as a general rule of thumb.  \n\n\nThird, a couple shield batteries or two outside your natural are good for holding pushes. That being said, however, cannons typically aren't necessary. A cannon is 150 minerals. That's enough for a zealot and a half. Zealots can move, cannons can't.  Try not to rely on cannons too much.  \n\n\nTo keep it simple, the 3 biggest things I think you can improve on this game are:  \n1. Spending your money in extra gateways and more units.  \n2. Stagger your unit composition more and attack one place at once. Protoss armies sometimes struggle staying split, and, even up to diamond, if you can execute one push really well, you typically win.   \n3. Take it easy on the cannons. Practice defending with units instead of static defense.  \n\n\nOn to cheese now.  \nCheese hurts. Even at high levels, cheese gets the better of you at times. The difference between someone at a higher level and a someone playing at a lower level is how they respond to that cheese. Not responding properly to cheese is what typically ends the game. To combat this, you can look up games where pros deal with cheese (parting and has are the two cheese legends of pro sc2 if you're interested), or learn the hard way.  \n\n\nIf you're dealing with a cannon rush, pull the probes. Pull 5-6 and surround the pylon the moment you see it go down. Send another probe to follow the probe that dropped the pylon. The important thing here is that you do not pull too many probes. Keep enough mining at all times and do not overreact. The goal here is to stop that first cannon from completing. If the toss drops a second pylon, pull more probes and surround that as well. In the event that a cannon has is close to finishing and you're nowhere close to killing the pylon, move everyone back. At this point, it's going to be hard. The thing is, with a cannon rush, if you hold properly, you're so far ahead that you're almost guaranteed a win.  The key to this? Practice.  \n\n\nTerran drops don't really qualify as cheese imo. Drops are just a part of play. Protoss has drops themselves and they're a pain to deal with (I'm looking at you, archon drops). That being said, the key to stopping drops is:\n\nA. having map vision and seeing the drop, B. having units ready preemptively. If you're hotkeying your army correctly, leave some stalkers in the base that aren't bound to your main army hotkey. That way, if a drop lands, you have units in place ready to deal with it. If anything, you might be able to snipe the medivac before it unloads.  \n\n\nThere's a LOT more to this. that hasn't been mentioned/explained thoroughly For the most part, focus on producing more units and spending your money.  \n\n\nIf you have any questions, feel free to message me!

If anything, wait for the other terran to move out and, if you position your fight properly, you can swallow their army and call it a day. If you\u2019re absolutely trying to break a tank line, however, liberators and ravens are the way to go.\n\nIn TvT, air is especially important. Whichever terran wins the air battle has a significantly higher chance of winning the game. This is due to a lot of reasons, but let\u2019s focus on siege tanks. The units in the game that can absolutely shit on siege tanks are liberators, ravens, and banshees. In a typical TvT, it\u2019s not surprising to see a lot of liberators and ravens mixed into your marine/tank simply because they can either 3 shot siege tanks without taking damage or disable them altogether in a fight.  To counter this, the other terran must get air units of their own, hence starting an \u201cair unit arms race.\u201d Typically, you have to find a healthy balance between vikings, liberators, ravens, tanks, and marines; it\u2019s rather convoluted at first, but it gets easier with time. Oh, and, in case this wasn\u2019t clear, get a second or even a third starport.\n\nMicro is a bit of a pain. That fact never changes. If you don\u2019t favor microing heavily, I would suggest holding off on the ravens for now and just learning how to set up with liberators and tanks.\n\nDon\u2019t worry about dropping the other terran to harass them. If you have a good unit composition and know how to set up your tanks and liberators such that it\u2019s hard for the other terran to attack into you without losing everything, you can keep containing the other terran while you expand behind it. Over time, if the other terran\u2019s economically suffocated and you\u2019ve been trading evenly, it should be a easy switch into BCs for you because of how far ahead you are in terms of macro.\n\nHope this helped!\nLet me know if you have any other questions.", "created_utc": "1544389122.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ebgao8s", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_a4of2g", "parent_id": "t3_a4of2g", "score": "9", "subreddit": "AllThingsTerran", "subreddit_id": "t5_2tfht"}, {"author": "A_Swimmming_Pigeon", "body": "Before I begin, I\u2019d just like to reiterate the golden rule of any matchup vs terran: For the love of all that is holy, don\u2019t attack directly into siege tanks if alternatives exist.\n\nLike the others have said, tech up if the terran\u2019s turtling and stop them from expanding. With the rate of how fast minerals run out in lotv, you\u2019ll suffocate them in no time.\n\nIn ZvT, it pays off to be patient. If the terran\u2019s not moving out, sure; take your sweet time teching up and expanding. If you\u2019re patient enough, the terran gets antsy and begins to move out. When terran\u2019s moving out, if your creep spread and overlord spread is good enough to see them moving out (or if the terran shoots a poor overlord) get your army in place to pounce before tanks can set up. Likewise, keep about 20 lings or so hotkeyed separately and parked outside the terran\u2019s base. Even up to low masters, terrans keep their walls down when moving out, so just A move your lings into the nearest mineral line and focus on your fight. The terran has to respond in 2 places, whereas you can focus entirely on killing siege tanks and taking a better fight (serral does a great job of this if you\u2019ve watched any of his games). In the event that you and the terran trade evenly, you\u2019ll come out ahead because of the runby, and if you lose the fight, well, at least you\u2019ve also dealt damage.  More often than not, though, terrans focus on saving their mineral line so much they forget to micro their army, which means it\u2019s easy pickings for you:)\n\nHope this helped!\n(side note: roaches melt under siege tanks; unless it\u2019s mech, I generally play Ling, bane, hydra/muta/corruptor against T.

It\u2019s slightly outdated, but I think it\u2019ll be of help (especially if you\u2019re playing terran).\n\nIn SC2, there\u2019s the holy trinity: army, upgrades, econ. You can\u2019t spend your resources on all 3 at once, so it\u2019s a matter of balancing it out and deciding what to do at what time. There are loads of build orders out there for each matchup, but I\u2019d suggest starting out learning the 1/1/1 build order; it\u2019s incredibly versatile and works in any matchup. As time goes on and you get a feel for macro, things will become intuitive; it\u2019s a good idea to start following a rigid build order as best as you can, and then slowly deviating as you get more comfortable with the game.\n\nWatching pro games and going on liquipedia are good places to find new things to try and improve on, but ultimately, improvement in starcraft boils down to playing more, and, more importantly, knowing what you did wrong. For instance, did you forget to produce units during a fight? Did you scout a stargate but still lose 8 workers to an oracle?  Small things make or break your game, so review your replays as necessary.\n\nAs for army compositions, there are two main compositions for terran: mech and bio. Mech is mostly expensive factory units built around a core number of siege tanks; they\u2019re slow and clunky, but a well set up fight becomes incredibly cost effective as your units just melt whatever comes your way. Bio, on the other hand, is mostly marine, marauders, and medivacs (people mix in tanks now though). Bio is fast paced, micro heavy, and versatile against almost every composition in the game (it\u2019s kind of your bread and butter, go-to terran build unless you\u2019re gumiho). (note: Maru vs Rogue in GSL season 2 is a prime example of bio play)\n\nAs a general rule of thumb, spend all your money. Banking minerals and gas is units or upgrades you\u2019re not getting.

In sc2, however, your personal skill determines the overall outcome of the game - if you lose, that's your own problem, nobody else's. By eliminating the aspect of team play, it's a lot easier for someone who's good at the game to rise up the ladder /very/ quickly and to be placed in the appropriate league (thanks to blizzard's promotion system). In league, however, if you get \"unlucky,\" or have to claw your way out of low elo through getting 100 LP and winning a Bo3/Bo5 promo series, the climbing process becomes noticeably slower.\n\nThe \"cherry on top\" comes from the difference in skill needed in both games. SC2 has a much harsher learning curve and difficulty, having to manage upgrades, worker production, army production, harass, positioning, scouting, and so much more. While league does demand that you pay attention to the minimap, your champion, and the rest of the map, you still ultimately focus on one champion in general. In SC2, it's like having an army of champions, each with their own abilities and positions. Because of the difference, it's inevitable that the SC2 ladder has some shifts implemented so that we don't have 60-70% of the general population stuck in bronze :D.\n\n", "created_utc": "1494983225.0", "edited": "False", "id": "dhnlm6b", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_6ag93k", "parent_id": "t1_dhjs1y7", "score": "1", "subreddit": "starcraft", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qpp6"}, {"author": "A_Swimmming_Pigeon", "body": "The core difference between LotV and previous expansions is mainly differences in micro.

While there are definitely suggested builds and compositions, at the end of the day, it really boils down to how well you've scouted and what your opponent wants to throw at you. If you're floating a lot of resources, remember to tech up to a hive and get your upgrades, or invest in your army even further. For instance, if you're pushing out with roaches, morph some of the damaged ones into ravagers, or morph some more zerglings to supplement the roaches. A lot of your early game minerals are usually either invested in drones, queens, or lings - if you have a lot left over, it usually means you have something else you can invest them in. You should be sitting around anywhere between 6 to 8 queens, with one at each hatchery for injects while the others spread creep (believe me, creep spread is an absolute must).\n\nSome of the more common compositions revolve around zerglings and banelings (around Lair tech of course) with metabolic boost (zergling speed) as well as centrifugal hooks (baneling speed) to take engagements. Other units to throw into the mix (i.e. hydralisks, corruptors) really depend on what your opponent has/is going for. As a general rule, if you can survive to late game and start pushing out with hive tech (i.e. ultralisks, brood lords), you're in a pretty good shape. It's a good idea to head over to liquipedia to check out some builds or watch some pro replays (Dark, Nerchio, Serral, and Life are all great zerg players) and see how they play.\n\nAgain, take this with a grain of salt - I'm not pro for a reason!\nHope this helped!", "created_utc": "1489110363.0", "edited": "False", "id": "deqhzwm", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_5y3drj", "parent_id": "t1_denz1xi", "score": "1", "subreddit": "starcraft", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qpp6"}, {"author": "A_Swimmming_Pigeon", "body": "A) Definitely!
