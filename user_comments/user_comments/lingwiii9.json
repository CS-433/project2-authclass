What is your purpose in majoring in Arabic other than you like it? Do you want to pursue an academic career? Translation? Teaching? Diplomacy? Because  these are the most likely career paths for you.\n\nAs of now, the chic factor of Arabic is big and one could easily suppose that by having a solid cultural foundation and high level language skills will take you anywhere, but the truth is, it won't, unless you have other skills and specialisations.\n\n**So before choosing a major, please reconsider what career AND lifestyle (you can onyl pursue an institutional career or freelance/own business is possible, moving abroad is a must, want to stay in your hometown/only move intra-country etc.) it is that you want.**\n\nMy best and warmest suggestion would be to specialise in something if there is something you feel interested in as a career, maybe go for a business and management degree AND learn the languages besides it.\n\nYou can find plenty of teachers and courses who can help you achieve a high level of fluency, you can still find scholarship opportunities to study in your target language's country, and all the cultural knowledge and readings, you can do on your own, for your own joy and interest. \n\nUniversity is university, not a language school. Also, often the level of teaching will not be enough for you to really have a good command of the language by the end of your studies, even with a few months abroad included.\n\nTranslation is offerred as a postgrad course in many countries anyway, so if you decide you want to earn that qualification, you can still do so, the same goes with any further postgrad and doctoral studies in your area of interest. But you will broaden your choices and opportunities big time if you choose a more specialised or universal subject for your studies, at least for undergrad.\n\nWishing you the best.", "created_utc": "1664635734.0", "edited": "False", "id": "iqmoud7", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_xsra2t", "parent_id": "t3_xsra2t", "score": "3", "subreddit": "learn_arabic", "subreddit_id": "t5_2v4vi"}, {"author": "lingwiii9", "body": "FYI, Rijeka/Fiume had special status: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corpus\\_separatum\\_(Fiume)", "created_utc": "1664621087.0", "edited": "False", "id": "iqlz4v7", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_xs7sh2", "parent_id": "t1_iqlvjgo", "score": "8", "subreddit": "europe", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh4j"}, {"author": "lingwiii9", "body": "Lol", "created_utc": "1664439578.0", "edited": "False", "id": "iqcdbuw", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_xqph8h", "parent_id": "t3_xqph8h", "score": "5", "subreddit": "languagelearningjerk", "subreddit_id": "t5_37rt5"}, {"author": "lingwiii9", "body": "Igen, \u00e9s egy\u00e9bk\u00e9nt a t\u00e9r\u00e9rzet sem utols\u00f3, t\u00e1gas, f\u00e9nyes terekben mozogni nagyon kellemes tud lenni, nem sz\u00f3lhat minden csak a f\u0171t\u00e9sr\u0151l\u2026.

You are only asking us to help you choose between the languages, but you have not really mentioned what is your purpose in majoring in these languages? Do you want to pursue an academic career? Translation? Teaching? Diplomacy? Because majoring in East Asian Studies, these are the most likely career paths for you.\n\nAs of now, the chic factor of these languages is very influential and one could easily suppose that by having a solid cultural foundation and high level language skills will take you anywhere, but the truth is, it won't, unless you have other skills and specialisations.\n\nIt sounds lovely you wish to live in these countries, but in this case especially, a competitive degree will grant you a way better job prospective, than East Asian studies, which will be the least competitive degree you can come up with for one of the toughest job markets out there like Korea. \n\nSo before choosing a language, a geographic area and a culture to engage with for the most of your career, please reconsider what career it is that you want.\n\nMy best and warmest suggestion would be to specialise in something if there is something you feel interested in as a career, maybe go for a business and management degree AND learn these languages besides it.\n\nYou can find plenty of teachers and courses who can help you achieve a high level of fluency, you can still find scholarship opportunities to study in your target language's country, and all the cultural knowledge and readings, you can do on your own, for your own joy and interest.\n\nTranslation is offerred as a postgrad course in many countries anyway, so if you decide you want to earn that qualification, you can still do so, the same goes with any further postgrad and doctoral studies in your area of interest.

If they insist, try to have them put this into writing, because if it is really so, they deserve a huge fine. But I think it is more likely that the bank clerk could not speak proper English and fully explain the problem to you.\n\nMany foreigners take loans in Hungary, you require the necessary papers like tax ID and proof of income from NAV, proof of residence etc., what anybody else is asked to provide.\n\nHowever, they are right in saying that if you don't speak Hungarian or not well enough, you will require an \"official\" interpreter, that is, an interpreter who has the required qualifications\n\n*\\[usually degree or professional certificate. For interpreters, you can have a look at* [*fordit.hu*](https://fordit.hu) *though not everyone is certified here, so you must state you require the services for a bank loan) or ask in specific Facebook groups\\]*,\n\nbecause you can sign the loan agreement only if you clearly understood the terms and conditions of it, in front of a notary public, but the contract will be in Hungarian, so even if you know the conditions well, officially, an interpreter still must be present for you to be able to clear up any potential misunderstandings and to read to you in your language what the notary public will read to you in Hungarian.\n\nBtw, the whole thing with the notary public is required for everyone universally, it is not because of the language, but to make sure people understand what they are getting into and on what conditions. Your \"extra\" addition to the process as a foreigner is the interpreter. Please note, the bank will not provide one, you will have to hire one for yourself. I would advise you to hire one to take part in the whole process, not just for the signing of the agreement, and not to take a friend, because my experience is neither the friend nor the bank clerk speak enough English to really understand and explain heavy financial/legal matters appropriately.\n\nGetting a loan is not always easy, the red tape can seem discouraging, but as long as you have a suitable proof of income, your income is high enough for your loan target and your target property is eligible, you will be fine. Bank clerks are themselves often a bit clumsy about loans and they might feel extra pressure when doing the paperwork for foreigners, having to rely on a foreign language etc. so just take it easy and try not to stress too much.

How could the blood test \"be done right\" in this case?\n\nIt is not the purpose of a blood test to increase awareness among doctors. It is what it is, a blood test. E.g. When I was diagnosed, I had a bunch of symptoms, I had a hormonal panel done and even when you get the results, unsatisfying results are marked with an asterisk, so you as a patient can already see if it is something going on, and the doctor will interpret your results, even if they are not marked, he can see if there are imbalances, close calls etc. Some symptoms are what they are, asserting a patient's pain or discomfort are hard to determine, while some symptoms are easier to determine, do you have it? yes/no.\n\nFrom what I have read in this thread, most people were not disappointed, because the blood test could not measure their LH, FSH, testosterone, androstendion, estrogene, insulin etc. levels, but the lack of willingness from the health care provider to even have that test done or when showing the results, the health care provider simply ignored to interpret the results. How could you make a hormonal panel more specific than measuring the hormones in question one by one?\n\nTherefore even current blood testing is ready and easy for a health care provider to deploy for a PCOS diagnosis for the diagnostical criteria like hormonal imbalance etc., which can be detected via a blood test. Also, you have ultrasound and see whether you have cysts or not, some patients don't, but still, it is something that is fairly easy to decide and detect. Should we have better, more standard benchmarks to scream to the doctor on the results slip, that hello, this is PCOS, maybe it could be easier, but from the technical part, considering PCOS is hard to define within a single standard framework and all patients have a very different set of emerging symptoms with varied severity, it might have a lot of co-morbidities influencing each other back and forth, I don't see where and what blood test you can deploy here.\n\nAs for awareness, I don't think it is the right word, because a health care provider should not be aware, but knowledgeable about all kinds of syndromes and ready to recognise them. I understand it if some older medical professional or some who are geographically disadvantaged might not be so familiar with it - but even that lack of experience cannot be a reason for unwillingness to diagnose. You have a patient and no clue what is going on, at least consult a colleague or refer your patient to one.\n\nWhile some people here are also from Europe and Canada and encountered uncooperative public health care professionals, most of the complaints seem to me to come from people who navigate the US health care system, where some tests might even depend on your insurance etc., so it might not be as much a technical issue than a systemic/health care management one.", "created_utc": "1632673196.0", "edited": "1632734172.0", "id": "hed1ev3", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_pvdzp2", "parent_id": "t1_he9ozwc", "score": "3", "subreddit": "PCOS", "subreddit_id": "t5_2ryc6"}, {"author": "lingwiii9", "body": "City Taxin\u00e1l a c\u00e9g k\u00f6t szerz\u0151d\u00e9st, kapsz taxik\u00e1rty\u00e1t \u00e9s havonta fizeted online, sz\u00e1ml\u00e1t let\u00f6lt\u00f6d.

Really happy PCOS is getting more scientific attention, wishing you all the best for your project!\n\nJust a question though, I am curious about how you can develop a better blood test for diagnosing PCOS - since my impression is that what impedes timely diagnosis is not the non-existence of blood tests (hormonal panel etc.), rather doctors not really knowing about PCOS or not considering it as an option, what I call \"frequency bias\" - most doctors hear a symptom and will come up with the top 3 most frequent things they know and encounter in their patient body, and rarely go beyond that if you are hard to diagnose. Also, where I live, it is hard to get a hormonal panel prescribed, because very few doctors are even aware of PCOS, think it is just an excuse for obese women, but if you go to a private service provider, you can have it all done for yourself, take the results to your gyno/endo (preferably to a private one, younger, more aware etc.), who will probably also do a physical exam, ultrasound, ask about your symptoms and will probably be able to tell if you have it or not. Anyway, my argument is that it is not really the matter of a blood test (though some benchmark might need to be recalibrated), but more the matter of having it done and checked - but if there is a technical way to improve diagnostics, I think that is cool and very curious to know more! :) Have a good weekend. :)", "created_utc": "1632601058.0", "edited": "False", "id": "he9f2kv", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_pvdzp2", "parent_id": "t3_pvdzp2", "score": "23", "subreddit": "PCOS", "subreddit_id": "t5_2ryc6"}, {"author": "lingwiii9", "body": "You have to use it, because people these days lack basic reading comprehension skills, they would take it literally and the online masses would come to tear you apart........therefore you must add /s to make it clear you are being sarcastic.

Please note, this is a very strong laser, only doctors can use it, so the traditional IPL often advertised in beauty salons is not the same thing.\n\nIt varies from person to person and the lighter skin and darker hair you have, the bigger the contrast, the more effective it can be for you, but that doesn\u00b4t mean with lighter hair or darker skin it will not work for you, but you will definitely require further rounds of treatment. At least this is what I\u00b4ve been told.\n\nThe first round was unpleasant and slightly painful (imagine something like pricking yourself with hot needles), but from the second time it was just the fraction of the pain or close to nothing as my hair became less and less stronger. I had to undergo 6 rounds, with quite a few months even half a year or more between each and after some years you might require a \"refreshing\" round. The hair cannot disappear totally and forever from a few places like under your knees where it is too strong, but overall, 95% of my hair did not grow back and what still grows is very soft and thin and unnoticeable. I am currently doing rounds for my armpits, it\u00b4s not as effective as on my legs, becase the hair is stronger, but still grows slowly and a lot less and softer.\n\nIt took a total of three years to finish all rounds, but even after the first one I did not have to shave again, a friend who did the same and with stronger hair, did not have to shave again after the 2 round (but it is important that you still finish all sessions to properly BBQ your hairbuds).\n\nThe treatment is not the cheapest one, but since a lot of time passes between two sessions, it is manageable and I think well worth the investment. I am located in Europe, so can\u00b4t tell you much about US prices if you are located there, but one round for me was 500 EUR (that\u00b4s a monthly salary here in the Eastern part).\n\nWishing you all the best! :)", "created_utc": "1628857190.0", "edited": "False", "id": "h8ry02y", "is_submitter": "True", "link_id": "t3_p3k6qw", "parent_id": "t1_h8rvvzk", "score": "3", "subreddit": "PCOS", "subreddit_id": "t5_2ryc6"}, {"author": "lingwiii9", "body": "Hi, I can and did, nothing came up except for IR and PCOS.", "created_utc": "1628856432.0", "edited": "False", "id": "h8rwojl", "is_submitter": "True", "link_id": "t3_p3k6qw", "parent_id": "t1_h8ruzgi", "score": "2", "subreddit": "PCOS", "subreddit_id": "t5_2ryc6"}, {"author": "lingwiii9", "body": "Thank you.

I saw PCOS as just another task/problem to solve on my list. So I went to see an endocrinologist, did my homework in reading various sources, hired a personal trainer, cooked & ate what recommended - I am a very compliant and well-disciplined person in general.  I also had prior experience with large-scale weight loss *\\[achieved with moderate exercise and diet\\]*, so I kinda knew the drill, I always had more stressful periods in my life when some weight crept back (10-15 kgs from 30-40 kgs lost) and I quickly got it back under control.\n\nA few years ago I gained 30 kgs in TWO MONTHS (*before you ask, no I did not eat extremely unhealthy, just regular stuff - meat, veggies, sometimes potatoes/rice if with family, but I don\u00b4t drink soda, no snacks etc*.). I knew it was not OK, went to see several doctors then for quite some time until I could find out I have IR and PCOS. In the meantime, I kept ballooning more and ended up with around 50-60 kgs of excess weight. The last 20 kgs being my own fault for giving up and just eating random junk I never allowed myself before, because I thought to myself, what can I do anyway, how worse could it get etc.\n\nSo, I put PCOS on my list to solve problems and took metformin, inositol, vit D, other vitamins, went low carb/also tried keto, exercise, all the crap you can read about. I though I would bombard PCOS/IR out of my body.\n\nWith a strict regime, medication and going to the gym every day, doing cardio, lifting weights, I barely lost 10 kg, most of it being water weight and then the weight loss stalled. \n\nNothing could restart it and I was running out of ideas. \n\nThen I had a pretty hard and busy period at work. On my busiest days, I would eat nothing, just drink water, I\u00b4m never hungry nor have appetite when I am this busy and focused. I noticed I was starting to lose weight. I realised it works, so I kept going. Drank lots of tea, water, sometimes coffee, if I felt very cold, then a cup of keto-friendly hot chocolate, did some cardio at home, tried to sleep more. It worked miracles. I felt great, lost close to 25 kgs in two months and I felt I was starting to live in a human body again. \n\nAlso, it was a relief, I did not have to stress myself over getting to the gym in time, not being able to go to the gym during covid, not having to think hard of what to eat every day etc. Before that, I felt like my diet and exercise regime was just another full-time job (btw, I own a business, so working excess pretty much all the time) and it was a HUGE mental load for me, and I already had a lot from work anyway.\n\nHowever, after some time, even my fasting weight loss stalled. The holidays came, I went home, had a few careful but nice meals with family, then I restarted it and now even this does not seem to work any more. But will keep trying and see if I can do another -25, as it would really help me to go a manageable weight (that is, below 100 kg. Goal is between 70 and 80, I am tall and also have a lot of muscle besides the fat).\n\n***I am NOT proposing you to starve yourself in any way. I KNOW it is not healthy***, it can result in eating disorders, yoyo effect etc. **It is just my own experience, because I was just desperate nothing of \"the usual protocol\" worked** and honestly, any moment I spend in this huge and unhealthy body is potentially worse then those few months of doing this and reaching a healthier, manageable  weight where I can exercise more freely and reclaim the joy of cooking.\n\n**However, if you can manage your weight well and effectively without having to go this extreme, PLEASE DO. There are a lot of nourishing, healthy and yummy foods and you should not give upon them. Also, I love cooking and experimenting with new, healthy recipes can be pretty fun! Or even quick and simple! If your excess weight is not extreme, but manageable and you can maintain a not too fast, but steady paced weight loss, don\u00b4t torture yourself like this, keep a healthy and running metabolism and give yourself a bit of \"food joy\". At the end of the day, PCOS will not really go away and you are in for the long-term to change your eating pattern and habits.
