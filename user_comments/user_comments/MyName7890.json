No doubt about it. But you have really shaken me to my core about a subject that I had a great deal of trouble with in the past. There are a lot of us on reddit that have a very hard time dealing with death and have a pretty terrible health anxiety, and knowing I'm not the only one on reddit suffering, and I should assure you that your post has caused harm to some other people on this site.\n\nThe reality of the situation is, not to shrug off rabies as a disease, but know that it is VERY ALMOST UNFATHOMABLY unlikely that you have this disease.  Just reading your long winded post about how we should be scared has placed me back into my debilitating fear that I just recently was able to get over in the past half-year.  I was bitten by a dog at the end of it's lifespan at a vet hospital.  The dog was very docile and it bit me when I put pressure on it's injured leg.  Not a hard bite, but it did break skin. We cleaned it immediately and checked to see if the dog had it's shots and rabies vaccination, and what do you know, it did.  And they don't fuck around with those vaccinations.  the dog was given a yearly shot and I was told by our vet that in some cases these shits are given yearly but usually fully cover the dog for far longer than that.  The yearly shot is to be cautious and be absolutely sure.  So I'm okay right?  Not in my mind, after days of research later, sleepless nights, POSTS LIKE YOURS, and a couple of emergency room visits that have subsequently wrecked my credit I was sent into a tailspin about rabies.  Every headache, every twinge in my arms, everytime my throat got scratchy, that was it.  Even posting this I have been having to tell myself that TYPICALLY if you're bitten on the hand the virus would have taken hold by now.  TYPICALLY.  The 8 years is an anomaly and when you post things like this you are worrying people literally to where it ruins their lives in the short and long term.  I went to my primary care physician 3 times only to have him tell me not to come back again because my worries were ludicrous.  What gave me the fuel?  Well a terrible mental battle with anxiety, ONLY fueled by stories like yours.\n\nIf you get bitten, OF COURSE, go to the ER and be cautious.  OF course your should there is no doubt about that.  But stop pretending that this disease is some sort of epidemic.  It has been largely eradicated when it comes to both dogs and cats, domestic and feral, and unless you have contact with wildlife you SHOULD NOT let this disease worry you.  I am upset at this post because I see people commenting that they are scared, and they flat out shouldn't be.  There are 300 million americans and on average 2-3 a year have died from rabies since the turn of the century, and most of them were from bites that took place overseas. \n\nStop your fear mongering.  I agree it is a very serious disease that once it takes root YOU ARE DONE, but people with health anxiety please be reminded that he is sourcing a ton of anomalies, and it is very rare that a dog salivating on you, or a cat nipping you will give you rabies.", "created_utc": "1664898596.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ir12m4g", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_xv3r1h", "parent_id": "t1_iqzzvnq", "score": "9", "subreddit": "polls", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh65"}, {"author": "MyName7890", "body": "Yep.

You dont buy more than you can afford. You make sure you either have no work the next day or you drink less so you will be fine to go into work. You dont drink to excess save for maybe a rare party occasion. If you cant drink for 2 weeks bc of outside circumstances you may be a lil put out but you can easily get over it.\n\nAn alcholic:\nYou drink multiple times a week. You may be spending more money in drinking than isfinacially wise and it may be hurting other aspects of your life. You cannot limit yourself when you have work the next day so you either show up hungover and do a halfassed job or call in sick regularly. You often drink more than is wise and it may be affecting your health. If there is an outside circumstance that is preventing you from drinking for 2 weeks you will have a really hard time coping mentally and physically and will constantly be waiting to drink.\n\nThis is the difference between normal human behavior and an addiction. The same goes for sex. But even unlike alchol, sex (if done safely) does not have any negative monetary or health effects from doing it multiple times a week. Sure sex is enjoyable and people want to do it often but so is eating a nice homecooked meal or doing your favorite hobby.

If you are meeting a tutor once a week for an hour Id say at least go over 2 gramnar points. maybe 3. the tutor is kinda just there to introduce it and answer any questions and do some practice. \n\nA structured course is key:\nTtmk in Korean is always a good shout. You can test ur level on their site and go from there. Their lessons are short i'd say u could do 2 or 3 a week.\n\nAnother course i highly reccomend, even above ttmk is korea university's quick korean (\ube60\ub978 \ud55c\uad6d\uc5b4) on youtube. Their lessons cover full courses from levels 1 to 4 i think. Level 1 is taught in english but level 2 onwards is korean which really helps immersion. \n\nVerbs:\nAlso don't learn just verbs. Always learn them in context. Knowing \ucd08\ub300\ud558\ub2e4 means to invite is all well and good until you have no idea what particle to use and how it works at all in use. Instead learn like this:\n\n\ucd08\ub300\ud558\ub2e4 - to invite \n\n\uc800\ub294 \uce5c\uad6c\ub97c \ud30c\ud2f0\uc5d0 \ucd08\ub300\ud588\uc5b4\uc694\n\n\ubbfc\uc218\ub294 \uc800\ub97c \uc9d1\uc5d0 \ucd08\ub300\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \ubc14\ube60\uc11c \ubabb \uac14\uc5b4\uc694\n\nUse at least 2 sentences. But 3 is usually better.\n\nThe same rule goes for any vocab that you arent super confident about. Like you wouldnt do this for like \uc0ac\uacfc but maybe you would for \uc804\uc7c1 \n\nAnki!!: Drops and quizlet are...ok for memorising but I'd highly reccomend anki. Its a must for language learners. Any new vocab or verbs you learn, pop them into ur master anki deck. They used spaced repition so if you do it every day you will end up knowing a lot. Don't just put in words. Also put in each example sentence in its own flashcard. I cannot reccomend anki enough. Make sure when reviewing to say the word out loud. Write front of flashcard in english and back in korean. So ur being asked to translae to korean. Cant recommend anki enough. Its improved my Korean ability so much. Spaced rep is so important.\n\nAlso rather than using a list or drops for vocab invest in ttmks 'natural korean conversation for beginners' book. Also download the ttmk book reader app for the audio files. Use this as reading n listening practice and to mine vocab. (Focus more on listening than readning as listening is the hardest aspect of korean)\n\n\n\nOverall. Heres what I would suggest. In this order. Whenever you have time.\n\nYou should review your anki deck every single day. Even if only for 5 minutes. But try get through as much as you can each day. There is a daily limit you can decide.

I think these types of programs can be great to bring up your knowledge of korean but they should really only serve as a support for your conversational practice.\n\nThe real benefit of the program being in korea isnt so much the intensity but the ability to be speaking korean all the time. If you spend say 4 hours a day in class learning korean but then only hangout with foreigners and speak english outside of class your skills will be wayyy worse than a person in the exact same class as you that spends a few hours a week hanging out with koreans or doing language exchanges with koreans.\n\nTL;DR: the language program can be amazing or dissapointing in building your skills depending on the amount of time you spend practicing korean with natives outside of class while youre in the country.", "created_utc": "1651651669.0", "edited": "False", "id": "i79nh6r", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_ui16xk", "parent_id": "t3_ui16xk", "score": "36", "subreddit": "Korean", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rd8q"}, {"author": "MyName7890", "body": "I think with coke specifically the problem is its a lot more addictive than alcohol.

If you have a terminal illness with less than a 50/50 chance of survival, or a life ruining illness like dementia that theres no cure for, then I think you absolutly should have the right to kill yourself as well as access to euthenasia, even if youre quite young (but still above 18 obviously.) You are not doing someone with progressive dementia or a mostly likely unsurvivable disease any favours by forcing them to stay alive. There is no point to physically being alive if your quality of life is wilting away and theres little to no chance of it ever improving.\n\nOn the other side of the issue I do not think someone should be allowed to off themselves just because they have depression or some other mental illness or are just struggling in life in general. This is because depression absolutely can be treated and there is a huge possibility that your life quality could go up massivly if you just get the right help. I think for most mental illnesses you shouldnt have the right to kill yourself bc ur really not thinking clearly when you are depressed. You could argue the same for dementia of course but the key difference is that depression can improve. So I think that you should be stopped from killing yourself in these type of circumstances.\n\nMany people who have been forcefully stopped from comitting suicide have gone on to live good lives after getting help and end up glad they werent able to go through with it.\n\nSome ppl ofc manage to beat the odds of low survival rate illnesses, but many more suffer for an unnecessary amount of time before they eventually die anyway. So I think if youre given the raw statistics of your condition and info on what treatment will be like and what to expect, you should have the option to end it to save yourself from the needless pain and suffering that lies ahead.\n\nEdit: spelling", "created_utc": "1650638589.0", "edited": "False", "id": "i5r6ai3", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_u9eo9t", "parent_id": "t3_u9eo9t", "score": "1", "subreddit": "polls", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh65"}, {"author": "MyName7890", "body": "If a crime is commited against you soley because of ur race and religion, its a hate crime.
