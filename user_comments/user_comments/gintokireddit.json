Good flats can probably be built, but I 100% don't trust our government (regardless of their political party) to make sure it's done well - I imagine they'll just focus on saving money in the short-term and housing as many poor people as possible, at the expense of the living standards of the occupants and properly considering potential long-term problems.

Unarmed fights happen, force has to be used. Armed normally no force is actually used. Similar to how it's less violent to have a big security guard with a gun than a small unarmed security guard, because nobody challenges the big one. So it could be someone does gunpoint robbery because they think it's actually safer.\n\nNeighbourhoods will be angry and sad, when their father, brother, cousin, son etc is killed and missing from their family. See all the Americans without fathers. Violence will be more normalised, with people doing violent vigilantism.\n\nCountry is fucked, with rich people getting way more opportunities than poor people.

It also isn't worse than other crimes in terms of how likely the criminal is to stop being a criminal/be reformed in the future, so it would be killing someone who had a decent chance of living a normal life.

This was deliberately seized upon by some to insinuate that I see ethnic minorities as being in opposition to the working class \u2014 a wholly ridiculous proposal.\r  \n\r  \nI believe the \u201cliberal left\u201d \u2014 what I understand to mean the political and media representatives of Blairism, who have socially left-leaning but economically right-leaning views, not \u201cleft-Remainers\u201d, many of whom I recognise as solid comrades \u2014 have been complicit with aggressive, neoliberal policies, have allowed Labour to abandon its core base and have left millions of people disgruntled and isolated from wider society.\r  \n\r  \nThe far-right have sought to take advantage of this \u2014 sometimes successfully \u2014 by offering horrific alternatives...\"\n\n\r\rNot an endorsement of the far-right, as you're trying to make out by taking something out of context.\n\nAlso ridiculous that you want to smear him for an article praising the Russian guy's social projects, by bringing up an unrelated quote about women. We're only allowed to highlight the good someone's done, if they also have a perfect track record on everything else? Can't praise Obamacare in the US, because Obama also did drone strikes?

In Japan in 1993, Pancrase held an event in Japan that was basically MMA, but no close-fisted punches to the face allowed (so more kicks, grappling, slaps) and many fighters were Japanese pro wrestlers and they all wore WWE-style boots.\n\nUFC 1 was in 1993. No time limits and was openweight. Won by Royce Gracie, a BJJ fighter. UFC was actually intended to be an infomercial for Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, to show that BJJ can beat all the other styles and even beat bigger guys. Then people realised the best style is to mix elements of different styles. UFC is the biggest promotion nowadays, but from about 1997-2007, Pride FC was the biggest promotion, based in Japan, when MMA and kickboxing were huge in Japan (often called the Bushido Boom). They had 40K people in stadiums, even 70K+ one time and the fighters (Japanese or foreign) were mainstream stars, even a lot of manga comics mentioned non-Japanese MMA fighters and fighters would appear on game shows. They sometimes had tournaments where they fought more than once in a night. Fedor was widely considered GOAT back then. The fights were in a boxing-style ring, 10 minute first round, 5 minute second round and unlike in the UFC knees and kicks to a downed opponent were allowed, but elbows to downed opponents weren't allowed. Pride closed because of Yakuza links being revealed, leading to the loss of a major TV deal and then the UFC bought Pride and closed it down.\n\nUSA and Brazil have the most UFC champions in history, but the sport is growing elsewhere, with many European countries (eg Poland, Ireland, UK, Czech Republic, Russia) getting their first champions in the last several years. Mexico, China, Australia and NZ have had champions recently too. France only recently legalised MMA (because considered dangerous/their judo association lobbied against its legalisation). New York only legalised MMA in 2016, probably because the at-the-time UFC owners (Fertitta brothers) ran NY casinos that didn't allow labour unions, so the labour unions lobbied against MMA being legalised. Still illegal in Norway.\n\nIn the US biggest mainstream stars have been Conor and Ronda. The fighters most commonly cited as GOAT are GSP, Demetrious Johnson, Fedor, Jon Jones, Anderson Silva, Jose Aldo and Khabib. Lightweight is often considered the most consistently competitive and high-level division.\n\nONE FC is a big promotion based in Singapore. It's not considered to be on par with the UFC yet, but it's on SE Asian TV and they get many fighters from countries that the UFC doesn't scout in (eg Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, India, Pakistan), plus some fighters from Europe, Brazil, Korea, Canada and US go there. They also have Muay Thai fights in MMA gloves, with some of the best European and Thai fighters. They have an Indian-Canadian HW champion now (guessing you're Indian). ONE FC has almost the same rules as Pride FC, with a few differences (in a cage, grounded elbows permitted, no soccer kicks to grounded opponents).\n\nMMA is a sport that's always evolving. Eg BJJ subs off back are less common now, calf kicks are quite new, more techniques from other combat sports are always coming into MMA, like more feints from kickboxing, head movement from boxing and throws from judo.\n\n~~Leon Edwards is the GOAT.~~", "created_utc": "1661112017.0", "edited": "False", "id": "il8e6sy", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_wu756a", "parent_id": "t3_wu756a", "score": "1", "subreddit": "MMA", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhj4"}, {"author": "gintokireddit", "body": "He said his body didn't respond after round 1.

ISIS destroyed ancient buildings in Syria, Britain dismantled many buildings in South Asia, but those civilisations, cultures and achievements still existed.\n\n  \nAlso with Punjab and the rest of Hindustan specifically, of course there's huge shared heritage, which can be seen just looking at today (which isn't during Mughal rule). Huge overlap in language (even Bangla and Punjabi are more related than European languages of lands that are much more geographically close to each other), clothing, cricket, architecture, clothing, food, religious practises, attitude to family and friends and other things. You can't just discount Mughal rule and the \"1000 years of Buddhism\" (which I suppose means 1000 years of Buddhist countries, not \"Buddhism\". Countries are more than just their religion - post-revolution France, and Tsarist Russia were both Christian; Taliban's Afghanistan and Indonesia are both Muslim, but that tells almost nothing about the system of governance or the culture), as if it didn't happen or just because it goes against your political crusade. It did happen, whether you like it or not. It's like saying \"well, I'm 70 years old and my life had nothing to do with the military, as long as you ignore the 20 years I was in the Army\". Extreme mental gymnastics, while normal people see the reality of how much people have in common with each other. Put 100 Punjabis, Iranians, Turks, Uzbeks, French and people from Delhi, without a doubt the Punjabis will have more in common with the people from Delhi and the least with the French. You put a Punjabi with Indians from many parts of India and there's very little chance of culture shock - literally without being told they're Indian, they won't even notice.", "created_utc": "1660504775.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ikaf21h", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_wo3p4g", "parent_id": "t1_ika47vl", "score": "1", "subreddit": "pakistan", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh89"}, {"author": "gintokireddit", "body": "Obviously there is huge overlap in history.

Paksitan is not unique in this regard - sports either develop in a country (or even a community within a country) through a planned drive or through a famous athlete in that sport emerging from that place.\n\nFor example, the Pakistan Army was largely responsible for the growth and success of Paksitani squash in the 50s until the 90s, I think it became a part of the culture in the Army and better-off Cantt areas.\n\nWhy is England good at soccer? Because it's played in schools for free from the age of 5, there is a culture of passion for it because it's already a popular sport and there are players in the league structure (British and foreign) to look up to. Why is France more successful than England in soccer? They have the same as England, but they also have more outdoor spaces to practise soccer (even in the ghetto areas there are very local non-grass playgrounds to play sports in, Riyadh Mahrez talked about this being a difference between growing up in France and what he sees in Manchester), they have an academy in Paris which turned France from being on the fringe of winning trophies to actually winning them. Not sure about France, but some years ago in England it was talked about how the Spanish kids play soccer on smaller pitches, but in England we grew up playing on full-size pitches, which means it becomes more about physicality at the youth level (to be able to run around on a big pitch) and less about skill development, which is why English players until very recently were less skilled on the ball than Spanish players - the players who did well in England at the youth level were those who could rely on their physical speed/strength/stamina and never had to develop as much skill or simply couldn't develop skills as much, because they're tired.\n\nWhy are there so many South Korean female golf players? Partly Pak Se-ri was successful in the 90s-2000s and became a star, inspiring others to play.

Well, partly because the Caucasus are generally good at wrestling and have it as part of their culture (for whatever reasons. Tough area to live, mountains, nomadic cultures so need sports you can practise literally anywhere - I don't know), but also because there are privately set up schools there that have a training regime from a young age. For example Abdulmanap's school (Khabib's father) and the Five Directions school (where Zabit Magomedsharipov trained, which also why Dagestan is successful in sanda and wushu [Documentary](https://youtu.be/Q0EwWAjIi20?t=232)).\n\nWhy is South Korea (for example) so good at Judo. Partly because they have schools where the judo teams train 2x a day five days per week, at around 15 years old.\n\nWhy is USA so good at wrestling? Partly because they have wrestling in almost all schools and colleges, again teenagers training almost every day.\n\nCountries like Mongolia, Russia - they pay athletes money to win medals.\n\nUSSR had extensive sports science research, far ahead of America's - American sports scientist Michael Yessis has talked about (in video interviews I've watched) visiting Russia and being given Soviet research documents in the 70s-80s and being astonished by how deep the research was, and they told him it was just their old stuff. [ARTICLE](https://www.just-fly-sports.com/a-system-of-concurrent-training-for-team-sports-anatoliy-p-bondarchuk-and-michael-yessis/)\n\nWhy is Japan so good at quite a few sports? Well, they have a robust school sports system, so kids can compete in sports like basketball, volleyball, soccer etc against other schools. Basketball got more popular because of manga/anime (maybe the same for some other sports), so sometimes it's something less planned too, although you can still push for art projects to inspire people to do stuff (bit like the government of Pakistan spending money on Army songs to get support for whatever). Soccer they were very influenced by Arsene Wenger coaching a team in Japan's soccer league, which is part of why Japan now plays with such a nice passing style (now that style is more globally popular, but it wasn't like 10-20 years ago).\n\nWhy is Cuba so good at amateur boxing (eg Olympics)? Partly because they have schools that have dedicated boxing trainers. Some of the kids are taken out from normal schools and put into those schools.\n\nLike a lot of things in Pakistan, I think it comes down to so much corruption meaning nothing can be organised properly (eg you want to build a soccer pitch? Where's the money? How do you get the land? Is the government going to organise it? Even a running place (track or just a suitable road) is hard to find in Pakistan in most urban areas) and also foreigners don't feel comfortable to set stuff up (compared to in other countries), because of terrorism and because of political turmoil. And obviously sometimes the culture too: like parents think sports will take away from their kids' education.\n\nI mean wow, Pakistan even has good hockey and squash success in its history, but manages to throw even that away! Who is playing squash from Pakistan now? Hockey, Pakistan is still a good team, but way worse than before. Not sure why since I don't follow hockey, but there is hockey in my family and it seems that Pakistan lacks the fitness in their hockey players, compared to other countries (including India, who have now caught up with European fitness standards). So no wonder it's hard to develop new sports, when the country can't even take advantage of its previous success and interest in hockey and squash, which should make a country ripe for more success, as long as people can play, the sport is marketed properly and the coaching is good from a technical perspective. Cricket thankfully hasn't been lost and is only improving with the PSL and with the new players getting more fit than the previous generations.\n\nBut yeh, it's not great.

In some of the 50 states of America the criminal justice system is used to disenfranchise voters, sometimes for their entire life or sometimes until they pay a hefty fine to get back their voting \"rights\". Typically this is a higher proportion of poorer voters, men and certain ethnic minorities. What happens if someone does a felony and then gets a normal job afterwards? Depending on their state, they might still not be able to vote.\n2. People from certain backgrounds get away with crimes more easily. The rule of law isn't fair. Eg more police in certain areas, in the US teenagers in student fraternities will do drugs and get away with it, while people in adjacent inner-city neighbourhoods will get a criminal record and maybe khabib'd by the police for smoking weed, drinking under-21 or doing other drugs. A corporate dude can withhold wages, avoid taxes, lie on their college application and get ahead, while some joe schmuk breaks a tiny law and gets a record.\n3. A lot of criminality is in part caused by conditions faced by people due to the government and society failing those without much money. For example, poor mental health services for poorer youths and poorer people in general (About 70% of prisoners in France suffer from at least one mental or psychological disorder and about 25% suffer from a severe psychotic disorder [LINK](https://www.prison-insider.com/en/articles/france-prison-et-sante-mentale) England [LINK](https://www.centreformentalhealth.org.uk/publications/future-prison-mental-health-care-england) America 43-44% [LINK](https://www.prisonpolicy.org/research/mental_health/)); poorer kids being less likely to be diagnosed with developmental disorders like ADD or Autism [LINK](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/10/171011180552.htm) or even for physical health conditions like cancer [LINK](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22472883/) or other conditions [LINK](https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/4/10/e005530), resulting in less support and people being more likely to reach breaking points or make poor life decisions; poorer students being more likely to underachieve (compared to their potential) in school, which in many countries is almost a life-sentence because of how difficult it is to fund re-schooling or re-training as an adult, so people will look for illegal ways to make money - even a lot of the British \"working class\" that you talk about do this, in the form of cash-in-hand jobs so they they can avoid paying taxes or sometimes even claim state benefits/welfare at the same time; poorer social services to support kids in poorer areas dealing with domestic abuse, sexual abuse, physical abuse, emotional abuse, neglect, bullying, racism etc - youths often join gangs to find social belonging or safety, people often do crimes to act out. You can also see the wealth of research done into how issues like this affect the likelihood of future criminality, including violent crimes and drug abuse [LINK](https://www.gov.scot/binaries/content/documents/govscot/publications/research-and-analysis/2018/05/understanding-childhood-adversity-resilience-crime/documents/00535550-pdf/00535550-pdf/govscot%3Adocument/00535550.pdf), if you spend as much time searching as circle-wanking over idpol.\n4.  People become discontent when they work hard, but have nothing to show for it at the end of the day or the end of the year and when there seems to be no legal avenue to better their lives. People work hard and only have enough to scrape by, while those with better fortunes live easily off their rent payments or the career they were able to get from a combination of working, but also having a relative leg up - there's always someone out there who didn't get certain individual opportunities that you got. A homeless teenager looks at someone with bad parents who beat and chastise them but at least give them a roof over their head and thinks \"wow, you've been handed something I didn't get\". When people feel like they deserve more, they'll eventually try to grab it, even if it means breaking the law. People see other people breaking legal rules or just seemingly not having to play by the same societal rules as they have to and think \"fuck it\". \"They didn't have to work their way up\", \"they didn't have to pay their own rent and bills from a young age\", \"they didn't have to travel by public transport for hours every day to get to work\", \"they didn't have to suffer being beaten by their parents, \"they didn't go hungry\", \"they got a job easily because they're black/white/blue/pretty\", \"you had parents/siblings/cousins/friends supporting you\" etc.\n\nThis can be a tax-evading building-site labourer, chef, electrician or even an office worker moonlighting as a delivery driver. It can be people who can't afford their first car insurance but know that the best job opportunities require a car, so they fully drive without insurance or a group of friends pool money together to buy car insurance under one of their names and then share the car (still totally illegal). It can be people who work a normal job for a bit but feel underpaid or even aren't able to find any employment in the first place (because they don't have experience, connections, don't have the right look) and decide to start illegally selling drugs or stolen cars. Someone who starts doing robberies because they rightly or wrongly feel like life is unfair because some people got some things for free that they didn't. It can be Francis Ngannou, who worked in a sand mine in Cameroon for a decade from the age of 10 and one day thought \"is this going to be my life?\" and traversed the Sahara Desert so he could illegally move to France to start training and became a UFC champion. It could be Brazilians who can't find a house and start building a favela. Someone who breaks the law, saves money and starts a legitimate business.\n\nThese things don't account for all crime, but they are relevant in many cases, maybe even the majority of cases.\n\nAnd yeh I live in an area where there are stabbings, dickheads in loud cars, shootings in the day time, crackheads talking to themselves or pretending to be homeless, I mean ffs some prozzie-looking chick in a russian hat tried to follow me home last month, my work colleague was walking home and unfortunately witnessed a youth bleed to death after being stabbed, me and him walk home on adjacent streets (I have to say that, because people will be like \"I live in the fucking hood yo wassup bro bruv dun come here ya get merkd yeehaw giddyup\" just because their city made the news). And these people are fucking annoying (so are students btw), but I sympathise with some of them and get that they sometimes also don't have the best options.

Kamaru's went down I guess with better competition and then it's gone up, mirroring the perception that his striking's improved. I wonder how he compares to Leon Edwards, considering in their first fight Leon seemed to be a bit more accurate than Kamaru (in the open striking, not sure if that's counted separately from the knees to the thigh/glutes against the fence) and Leon's always been known to have good striking, whereas Usman had clear room for improvement.\n\nObviously high volume styles won't have the highest accuracy, but it's interesting that Max's has been almost always increasing, wonder what causes that. I guess he entered the UFC extremely young and then was constantly improving his game, plus his last two fights were a bit of a step down in competition compared to Volk/Poirier.

It took four weeks for subtitles to be restored on Sky, Freeview, Youview and Virgin Media. It was another four weeks before subtitles were restored on Freesat.As a result, Channel 4 fell short of its annual quota to subtitle 90% of programmes on Freesat - achieving only 85.41% - in breach of its licence conditions.\"\n\n\"Channel 4 did not provide any information about the cause of the outage or steps being taken to resolve it for 12 days following the incident.  \nOn-screen TV guides included inaccurate information about the availability of Channel 4 access services until 14 October 2021, nearly three weeks after the outage began.  \nDeaf viewers were likely to be among those most impacted by the outage, but Channel 4 did not provide any information to viewers in British Sign Language until 15 October.  \nNor did it broadcast any on-air advice or information about the outage until that date, when it issued a statement which read: \"Channel 4 would like to apologise to viewers for not currently being able to provide access services. We realise how frustrating this is for our viewers.\"  \nAudiences who did not have access to Channel 4's online information would have had no understanding about the scale of the issues or that the company was working to rectify them.\"\n\n\"Channel 4 must now report to Ofcom by the end of this year on the steps it has taken to ensure greater resilience of its access services, as well as how it is continuing to improve the accessibility of its programmes.  \nOfcom said it recognised that the Red Bee incident was \"unprecedented\" but following its review, the watchdog has made a number of recommendations broadcasters are expected to act on.\"", "created_utc": "1655736526.0", "edited": "False", "id": "id2c4d7", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_vgjvva", "parent_id": "t3_vgjvva", "score": "5", "subreddit": "unitedkingdom", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhqb"}, {"author": "gintokireddit", "body": "It doesn't seem to be \"middle class\" (whatever this means to different people.
