However, the effectiveness of phonetic training is not a direct consequence of the amount of exposure to L2 sounds learners receive or whether that exposure is more or less intense in time, rather its effectiveness depends to a great extent on how successful it is in directing learners\u2019 attention and L2 sound-processing ability to the phonetic cues native speakers attend to. \n\nThis appears to be the exact point OP is making.\n\nAnother: [Speech Perception Training can Facilitate Sound Production learning](https://pubs.asha.org/doi/abs/10.1044/jshr.3702.347)\n\n> This study examined the role of speech perception training in the correction of phonological errors. Twenty-seven preschoolers with phonological impairment who misarticulated /\u222b/ were randomly assigned to one of three groups: Group 1 children listened to a variety of correctly and incorrectly produced versions of the word \u201cshoe\u201d; Group 2 children listened to the words \u201cshoe\u201d and \u201cmoo\u201d; Group 3 children listened to the words \u201ccat\u201d and \u201cPete.\u201d A computer game was used to provide reinforcement for correct identification of the words. All children received the same traditional sound production training program for correction of their /\u222b/ error, concurrently with speech perception training, during six weekly treatment sessions. On post-testing, Group 1 and 2 children demonstrated a superior ability to articulate the target sound in comparison to Group 3 children.\n\ni.e. receiving speech perception training in addition to production training is better than just production training.

They are generally represented by the [International Phonetic Alphabet.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet)\n\n*Note: <angle brackets> here represent orthographic letters (graphemes), /slashes/ refer to phonemes, and [square brackets] refer to concrete sounds on a phonetic level and allophones.*\n\n- \"reduction to schwa\": see [Vowel reduction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vowel_reduction) and [Stress and vowel reduction in English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_and_vowel_reduction_in_English). It's very common in English for unstressed vowels to reduce to [schwa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schwa) [\u0259], like the <a> in \"**a**bout\". The <e> in \"synth**e**sis\" is usually reduced to a schwa and not pronounced like a stressed <e> would be -- compare to the <e> (/\u025b/) in \"bet\". As OP pointed out, [\u0259] does not exist in Spanish.\n\n- \"pure, unmixed vowels\", a.k.a monophthongs, are vowel sounds that do not change during the duration of the vowel. For example, the <i> in \"bit\" is (in most English dialects?) one single pure sound /\u026a/. All standalone vowels in Spanish are monophthongs. As opposed to...\n\n- \"Diphthongs\": vowels whose quality changes throughout the pronunciation of the vowel. For example, in \"boy\", <oy> is the diphthong /\u0254i/ where you smoothly glide from /\u0254/ to /i/ in one sound. See [Monophthongs, diphthongs, triphthongs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vowel#Monophthongs,_diphthongs,_triphthongs). Diphthongs *do* exist in Spanish (e.g. \"aire\"), but a single written vowel will never be a diphthong -- it'll always be written as two vowels next to each other (generally a strong vowel /a/, /e/, or /o/ with a weak vowel /i/ or /u/ -- but two vowels next to each other does not necessarily indicate a diphthong in Spanish!). See [Diphthongs and triphthongs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_phonology#Diphthongs_and_triphthongs) from the Spanish phonology wikipedia page. \n\n- \"[vowel hiatus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vowel_hiatus)\": This is somewhat similar to diphthongs, but there is no glide or intervening sound between two adjacent vowels. In general, in Spanish, two strong vowels next to each other constitute vowel hiatus -- there are two distinct, separate vowel sounds present and no glide in between (as in OP's example, p**ae**lla: [/a/ and then /e/, clearly separated](https://forvo.com/word/paella/#es)). Note: this is one of relatively few cases where Spanish orthography is not entirely phonetic. Compare the vowel hiatus in \"paella\" to the falling diphthong in \"[aeropuerto](https://forvo.com/word/aeropuerto/#es)\". \n\n-  [\"pre-L breaking\"](http://americanphonetics.ruhosting.nl/course/12-sonorants/12-3-3pre-l-breaking/): hadn't heard of this one before, but it seems to refer to vowels before the <l> at the end of many words in English becoming diphthongized, e.g. the insertion of a schwa sound in \"feel\" ([fi\u02d0\u0259\u026b] instead of just [fi\u02d0\u026b]). Don't do this in Spanish.\n\n- \"aspiration\": aspirated consonants come with a puff of air. Say \"pit\" and \"spit\" aloud with your hand directly in front of your mouth -- the /p/ sound is accompanied by a large burst of air in \"pit\" but much less so in \"spit\". All consonants are *un*aspirated in Spanish -- if you were to speak Spanish with a candle flame directly in front of your mouth, it would hardly quiver. [This video on LatAm Spanish phonology](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XW1JADx5KP0) does a good job showing the difference between aspirated and unaspirated consonants, around the 2:30 mark. Also see [Aspirated consonant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspirated_consonant).\n\n- [\"plosive\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plosive): a consonant during which the airflow completely stops. E.g. when saying /b/ or /p/ in English, your lips close entirely, and with /g/, your throat closes. As OP mentions, these are most often realized in Spanish as...\n\n- [\"approximants\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Approximant): A somewhat broad term that refers to sounds where the articulators (e.g. lips, tongue) in your mouth don't quite close together. The video linked above also has a section on approximants in Spanish. Perhaps the clearest example in Spanish is the bilabial approximant /\u03b2\u031e/ that appears when a written <b> or <v> comes between two vowels -- this is why you'll sometimes see native speakers mixing up \"a ver\" and \"haber\" in writing, since they're pronounced exactly the same way: [a\u02c8\u03b2\u031ee\u027e]. \n\n- [\"allophone\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allophone): \"phonetic realizations of a phoneme in a language, which do not contribute to distinctions of meaning\", i.e. a slightly different way of pronouncing the same sound in a language that doesn't carry any meaning. In English, using the example from the Wikipedia page, we don't distinguish between the aspirated [t\u02b0] in \"top\" and the unaspirated [t] in \"stop\" (and many native speakers can't tell the difference) -- they're allophones of the phoneme /t/. The distinction is important in, say, Hindi, where the asipirated and unaspirated versions could be considered separate phonemes since they distinguish between otherwise identical words.\n\n-  \"CV, not VC\": this refers to [syllable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syllable) structure, where C means consonant and V means vowel.\n\nedit: Fixed some transcription ambiguity.

I like *his* dog.\n\n\u201cHe\u201d, \u201chim\u201d, and \u201chis\u201d are all fundamentally different forms of the same word \u2014 they all refer to a male in the third person \u2014 but each form is used in a different grammatical context.\n\n> He watches baseball.\n\nThe man we are describing is the subject of the sentence (i.e. he does the action of watching baseball), so we use \u201che\u201d. This is the **nominative** case. \n\n> I see him every day.\n\nThe man is the object of the sentence (he is the \u201creceiver\u201d of the action, so to speak \u2014 I am the one who sees, and he is the one who is seen), so we use \u201chim\u201d. This is the **accusative** case.\n\n> I like his dog.\n\nWe are indicating that he owns the dog, so we use \u201chis\u201d. This is the **genitive** case. \n\nIn fact, the genitive case is the only grammatical case that remains in English for all nouns, e.g. \u201c*John\u2019s* car\u201d, \u201cthe *dog\u2019s* collar\u201d, \u201cthe *band\u2019s* first song\u201d. The way we form the genitive in English is (usually) by adding **\u2019s** to the end of a word. (This is known as the Saxon Genitive). The genitive is obviously formed differently in Polish, but showing ownership is, among other things, one of the ways the genitive case is used in Polish. \n\nSo, just as English pronouns have different forms depending on their role in the sentence (he/him/his, she/her/her(s), they/them/their(s)), *every single noun* in Polish has different forms. There are several different cases (nominative, genitive, dative, accusative, instrumental, vocative), and the way each case is formed depends on the gender of the word, the number (singular vs. plural), and the ending of the base form of the word.

It depends on the adjective. After all, what can cause an adjective to apply?

You\u2019ll get like 8 emails reminding you of the impending closure every few days and will give you information on how to back up your data.\n\nSee this page: https://uchicago.service-now.com/it?id=kb_article&kb=KB00016476", "created_utc": "1640819613.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hqh2bht", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_rrg1me", "parent_id": "t1_hqgw1e3", "score": "4", "subreddit": "uchicago", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh46"}, {"author": "abundantmediocrity", "body": "Not an expert, but I would imagine somewhere between 0% and 100%", "created_utc": "1640114481.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hpgl6s9", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_rllrfm", "parent_id": "t3_rllrfm", "score": "172", "subreddit": "uchicago", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh46"}, {"author": "abundantmediocrity", "body": "> Ice spikes grow as the water in an ice cube tray turns to ice.  The water first freezes on the top surface, around the edges of what will become the ice cube.  The ice slowly freezes in from the edges, until just a small hole is left unfrozen in the surface.  At the same time, while the surface is freezing, more ice starts to form around the sides of the cube. Since ice expands as it freezes, the ice freezing below the surface starts to push water up through the hole in the surface ice (see diagram).  If the conditions are just right, then water will be forced out of the hole in the ice and it will freeze into an ice spike, a bit like lava pouring out of a hole in the ground to makes a volcano.  But water does not flow down the sides of a thin spike, so in that way it is different from a volcano.  Rather, the water freezes around the rim of the tube, and thus adds to its length.  The spike can continue growing taller until all the water freezes, cutting off the supply, or until the tube freezes shut.  The tallest spike we've seen growing in an ordinary ice cube tray was 56mm (2.2in) long.\n\nFrom https://www.its.caltech.edu/~atomic/snowcrystals/icespikes/icespikes.htm\n\nYou can find a cool time lapse of one these forming here: https://youtu.be/7hgf7mY1XjU", "created_utc": "1639816701.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hp11k86", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_rj32d9", "parent_id": "t3_rj32d9", "score": "163", "subreddit": "Physics", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhi6"}, {"author": "abundantmediocrity", "body": "M31, the Andromeda galaxy :)", "created_utc": "1639142801.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hnzftm9", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_rd8fio", "parent_id": "t3_rd8fio", "score": "6", "subreddit": "AskAstrophotography", "subreddit_id": "t5_240mnx"}, {"author": "abundantmediocrity", "body": "It worked for a friend of mine to get off the CS 154 waitlist \u2014 he went to class for a week, spoke with the professor at the end of first week, and got into the class", "created_utc": "1638461441.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hmy25t8", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_r6lrld", "parent_id": "t1_hmw4wid", "score": "1", "subreddit": "uchicago", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh46"}, {"author": "abundantmediocrity", "body": "With the info you\u2019ve provided it\u2019s hard to tell whether it\u2019s the raw data or the processing (what equipment?

Based on this post it seems you have a tendency to use impressive-sounding words without fully understanding their meanings/connotations, and this can really muddle your writing. For example:\n\n>  Recruiters have a predilection for candidates who are good communicators to funnel through their company's talent pipeline.\n\n\"Predilection\" is almost always used with things and actions, not people. Someone could have a predilection for Italian food, a predilection towards eccentricity, a predilection for Classic Rock. You could say something like \"He has a a predilection for Mozart\", but in that case it's referring to someone's music taste, as in \"He is fond of Mozart's music/He thinks favorably of Mozart.\" In your sentence, \"Recruiters have a *preference* for candidates ...\" is a better choice, in my opinion -- it's both more clear and more natural. I will say that this is a very nit-picky correction, since \"predilection\" mostly makes sense in this context and certainly isn't incorrect, but it did stand out as sounding strange.\n\n> The people in these positions were called analysts and most of them have prestigious academic pedigrees.\n\nI think you probably mean \"prestigious academic degrees\". \"Pedigree\" refers to someone's ancestral lineage. It's occasionally used more broadly to describe a thing's history or background (the pedigree of a word, the pedigree of a philosophical idea, etc). \n\n> I even had users lambaste* my writing to make a point. \n\nWhat do you mean by \"to make a point\"? Additionally, \"lambaste\" is a strange word to use in this context. To lambaste something is to verbally attack it, to criticize it extremely harshly. The word's a bit too violent for this context. \"I even had users criticize my writing\" or \"I had users pick apart my writing\" or \"I had users read what I wrote and point out mistakes\" are better options, I think.\n\n> Native English speakers, by virtue, are good communicators when using English.\n\n\"By virtue\" sounds strange on its own -- the phrase is \"by virtue of\". (e.g. \"By virtue of being Native English speakers, Americans are good at communicating in English\"). You might rewrite this sentence as, \"Native English speakers are, almost by definition, good at communicating in English\". (The phrase \"good communicators when using English\" is a bit clunky, but I think the whole sentence/idea would have to be restructured to root out this clunkiness). \n\n> However, as my English skills gradually improved, I keep beating myself up for not being able to write as eloquently as I would have liked.\n\nI'm not sure what this grammatical concept is called, but the verb tenses aren't completely right here. The following two versions are correct:\n\n\"However, as my English skills gradually **improved**, I **kept** beating myself up for not being able to write as eloquently as **I would have liked.**\"\n\n\"However, as my English skills gradually **improve**, I **keep** beating myself up for not being able to write as eloquently as **I would like**.\"\n\nIt should be entirely past tense or entirely present tense.\n\n>  I make great efforts to eschew doubting my abilities, but I just can't disabuse myself of the notion that I am a failure.\n\nThere's nothing grammatically wrong with this sentence, but stylistically it sounds awkward. \"I make great efforts to eschew doubting my abilities\" could be expressed much more clearly as \"I make a great effort not to doubt my abilities\" or, for the sake of simplicity, just \"I try not to doubt my own abilities.\" Writing simply and concisely isn't necessarily the best option, but it's almost always a good one.\n\n> The more I read, the more terminologies I will discover. \n\n\"Terminology\" refers to a group of terms proper to a particular field/subject -- business terminology, scientific terminology, etc. I think what you're trying to convey here is something more on the lines of: \"The more I read, the more I expand my vocabulary.\"\n\nThere are a couple more sentences that sound slightly off, but It's 3:00 AM here and I'm having trouble pinpointing exactly what's wrong with them. I hope this comment didn't come off as too harsh. Major props to you for reading four hours a day -- reading is absolutely the best way to improve your writing. It seems that you're proficient enough as a writer now that most of your room for improvement is in stylistic choice and understanding the subtle nuances of less common vocabulary. My main advice to you is to simplify your word choice! Most of the times that you used \"impressive\" words, the simpler equivalent was a much better choice, both for style and for clarity. Find authors whose styles you enjoy reading and try to figure out what exactly it is that makes their style stand out. Recognize that writing is highly context-dependent -- the same person will likely write a business email and a fictional short story in completely different styles, and it's important that the style match the context.", "created_utc": "1630837200.0", "edited": "1630837483.0", "id": "hbo7fsx", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_pi2c70", "parent_id": "t1_hbnwgw9", "score": "3", "subreddit": "EnglishLearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2u8ap"}, {"author": "abundantmediocrity", "body": "\"I'm in Scotland in which I'm based\" sounds super, super weird to me.

It sounds a bit unnatural to my ears to say \"What about going to the movies tomorrow?\" as a direct substitute for \"How about going to the movies tomorrow?\", but the difference is pretty slight.", "created_utc": "1630562118.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hba8gff", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_pfu5fc", "parent_id": "t1_hb7o3ei", "score": "1", "subreddit": "EnglishLearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2u8ap"}, {"author": "abundantmediocrity", "body": "Grammatical case is definitely one of the hardest things to get used to coming from English. \n\n> I am learning that nouns change for numerous reasons grammatically\n\nHow familiar with the case endings are you right now? There's the nominative, genitive, dative, accusative, instrumental, locative, and vocative -- [page 12 and beyond of Oscar Swan's Polish Grammar in a Nutshell](http://www.placedauphine.net/random/PolishGrammar.pdf) has a basic overview of where each case is used. \n\n\nOften the information that English expresses through word order is expressed through case in Polish. So \"Maria ma ryb\u0119\" means \"Maria has a fish\", but \"Ryb\u0119 ma Maria\" *still* means \"Maria has a fish,\" since \"ryb\u0119\" is the accusative case of \"ryba\" and indicates that \"fish\" is the direct object of the sentence, and \"Maria\" is in the nominative case, indicating that she is the subject of the sentence. She is the one doing the action regardless of her position in the sentence, and the fish is being acted upon regardless of its position in the sentence, because that semantic information is expressed in the word endings themselves. To say that \"The fish has Maria\" (whatever that means), you would have to say \"Ryba ma Mari\u0119\" or \"Mari\u0119 ma ryba\". Maria, now being the object of the sentence, is in the accusative case, and ryba, now the subject of the sentence, is in the nominative case.\n\n> Can anyone tell me why the suffix varies in this instance? Is it arbitrary and something to memorize or is there some rule of thumb?\n\nSo, in general, the direct object of a transitive verb is in the accusative case, as in your example, \"mam ryb\u0119\". (This is a very general rule of thumb; there are many, many situations where this is not true. Certain verbs and structures will seemingly arbitrarily call for the direct object to be a different case than the accusative. The Oscar Swan pdf linked above goes into those, and there many YouTube videos that can explain the reasons why different cases are used much better than I can.) The reason why you say \"Jestem cz\u0142owiekiem\" (instrumental case) instead of \"Jestem cz\u0142owieka\" (accusative case) is that \"cz\u0142owiek\" is not actually a direct object. It's a predicate noun. After linking verbs like \"zosta\u0107\" (to become) or \"by\u0107\" (to be), the following noun is in the instrumental case. So,\n\n- Jestem **cz\u0142owiekiem**. (I am [a] human)\n\n- Justyna jest **\u0142adn\u0105** **dziewczyn\u0105** (Justyna is a pretty girl.)\n\n- On jest bardzo **dobrym** **uczniem**. (He's a very good student)\n\nAll of the examples above are in the instrumental case. One important exception is that after the phrase \"to jest\" (this is), the next noun will be in the nominative, not the instrumental. So, you'd say \"To jest m\u00f3j przyjaciel\" (this is my friend), NOT \"To jest moim przyjacielem\". \n\nGenerally, in the singular, nouns that originally end in *-a* will end in *-\u0105*, and everything else will end in *-em* or *-iem* depending on the consonant before it.\n\nI have a fish: Mam ryb\u0119 (the fish is the direct object, the thing the verb is acting on, so it's in the accusative case).\n\nI am a fish: Jestem ryb\u0105 (I am identifying myself as a fish, the fish is a predicate noun after the word \"to be\", so it is in the instrumental case).\n\n\nThere are several more situations where the instrumental case is used besides just this. I'd recommend watching [this video from Polski z Ani\u0105 on the instrumental case](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM-Uzgy225A). It's entirely in Polish, but there are English and Polish subtitles available if needed.\n\nWiktionary is also a good resource for looking up noun declensions. Every noun entry includes a declension table.

My physics TA has said that the difference in preparedness between physics students who take 131 vs. 141 in their first year is so huge that exam grade distributions in phys 185 (2nd year mechanics) have two distinct peaks. Phys 140's did wonders for building my problem-solving skills, and the class digs far deeper into the math and intuition behind physical phenomena than the 130's does. From what I've seen, the 130's are sort of like a fast-paced AP/IB Physics class but the 140's take a completely different approach to teaching and problem solving that's very different from anything I did in high school. The undergraduate physics advisor might tell you that the 130's and 140's are mostly the same and while the material covered is similar, that really isn't true. (The 130's are by no means easy, but it's a completely different experience). \n\nTaking both honors physics and honors math isn't impossible, but know that both sequences have a reputation for being really difficult. 141 was easily my hardest class first year. I know a couple people who took both 161 and 141 simultaneously. It's a shitload of work, but if you're dedicated to putting in a shitload of time, you'll probably be alright. \n\nSomething important to consider is the major requirements for physics -- ~~if you take math 160's, you'll still have to take the full math 183/184/185/186 physical sciences sequence in addition.~~ [not true, see comment below.] (I know one guy who took 161, 162, and then placed into 185 for third quarter, but I think this is a pretty rare exception since he'd already taken linear algebra and Calc 3 in high school -~~- if you go down this path, you'll probably have to do 161, 162, and then go into 183~~). Consider whether it wouldn't be better to take 183 your first quarter and get started on the math requirements for the physics major as soon as possible. (I'm biased, since this is what I did, but it really does make fitting everything else in the major so much easier and frees up a lot of time in later years). The 180's math sequence was pretty much made for physics majors -- I think the math and physics departments worked together to make sure that the material coincides as much as possible. E.g. Stokes' theorem is introduced in math 184 and is useful for the intuition behind Maxwell's equations in phys 142; the Fourier series is introduced in math 185 and is hugely useful for studying damped/driven oscillators in physics 143 -- the physics classes give the necessary overviews of these mathematical concepts, but covering them in detail in a separate class really helps with solidifying your understanding of their applications to physical systems. The 180s are also extremely interesting (and challenging) classes in their own right and serve far more than just support for physics.\n\ntl;dr take phys 141, take math 161 if you really want to but I'd strongly recommend 183 instead. Also, Henry Frisch is an amazing professor.

Some things to watch out for:\n\n- You start the piece around 110 BPM but then significantly speed up the tempo in measure 6 to ~130 BPM before slowing down again around measure 10 to the initial tempo. I\u2019m not sure if this is a conscious decision or not, and could certainly be up to interpretation, but when I first learned this piece I found myself accidentally speeding up during the triplet runs. The triplets in measure 6 are the same tempo as in measure 1 \u2014 if you play through from measure 1 to measure 10 without changing tempo (i.e. completely ignore the ritardando in measure 5) you\u2019ll get a feeling for how the tempo should be.\n\n- Practice measures 10 and 12 suuuper slowly !making sure you\u2019re playing them correctly! until you really have the triplets down. Measure 10 sounds decent but a little bit slurred, measure 12 sounds a bit syncopated \u2014 keep the triplets even. If you haven\u2019t done this yet, I\u2019d recommend sitting away from the piano and just tapping out the rhythms with your hands on a tabletop before applying it to the music. I found [this video](https://youtu.be/76kuNLs61xI) helpful for practicing polyrhythms. Another thing to try is playing the left hand on the piano and singing or humming the right hand. This way you can focus on getting the rhythm right in your head without worrying about hand synchronization, and then transition to getting your hands synchronized once you know you have a really solid mental model of how it should sound.\n\n- The A#-C#-A# and C#-E-C# in the last beats of measures 13 and 14, respectively, are supposed to be triplets. You\u2019re playing them as normal eighth notes. Make sure the first right-hand A# in measure 13 plays together with the A# in the left hand and the first right-hand C# in measure 14 plays with the E in the left hand. The same thing applies here for practicing these triplets as the ones in measures 10 and 12 \u2014 as tempting as it may be, get them down perfectly extremely slowly before thinking about playing at tempo. Be aware of triplet markings in the sheet music! They\u2019re all over the place in this piece.\n\n- the final G# in the right hand of measure 16 sounds with the E of the left hand, not the A#. Make sure you get the feeling of the G# \u201cfalling into\u201d the A in the next measure. Note the tenuto markings and that the F# is a quarter note, not an eighth note.\n\n- This isn\u2019t necessarily something to worry about right now since you\u2019re still figuring out the technical nuts and bolts, but don\u2019t neglect dynamics! There\u2019s so much room for dynamic variation. It can be helpful to associate the music with a very particular image or feeling \u2014 for me, this section is the ebb and flow of water or a flowing stream (as clich\u00e9 as that sounds) \u2014 and find your way of translating your image into music. Also, there are often 3 or 4 voices playing at once, and since we only have 2 hands, it can be easy to accidentally bog down the main melody in a sea of notes. Listening to recordings with the music in front of you has helped me with this sort of thing.\n\nTriplets can take some work to get used to, but once you really get them down, it\u2019ll be that much easier next time you encounter them. Eventually you\u2019ll wonder why they gave you any trouble in the first place.

Ionized sulfur gas (Sii) primarily releases light at wavelenths of 671.7 nm and 673.0nm, which fall into the red part of the [visual spectrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visible_spectrum#/media/File:Linear_visible_spectrum.svg). Ionized hydrogen gas has several spectral lines, the brightest of which is hydrogen alpha (aka Ha) at 656.28 nm, also in the red part of the visual spectrum. Doubly ionized oxygen (Oiii) releases light primarily at 500.7nm, which is a bluish-green color. So instead of taking a photo that covers the entire visual color spectrum, OP used specialized narrowband filters that isolate those 3 wavelengths (Sii, Ha, Oiii) in [very narrow slices](https://imgur.com/a/zR1gL5H) of the full spectrum and took separate images of just the Sii light, just the Ha light, and just the Oiii light. He then mapped the sulfur image to red, the hydrogen image to green, and the oxygen image to blue (this is the false color part). Part of the reason why this is useful (and visually more appealing) is that it differentiates between Sii and Ha, which would normally be a pretty similar red color -- now we can see clearly that the red regions are sulfur rich, the green regions are hydrogen rich, the blue regions are oxygen rich, the yellowish regions have both hydrogen and sulfur, the purplish regions have both sulfur and oxygen, etc. [This site](http://www.astronomymark.com/hubble_palette.htm) gives another comparison between the Hubble false-color palette and true color on a different object, and [this site](https://photographingspace.com/ap-color/) has another explanation of the Hubble palette and more example images.\n\nEdit: I\u2019m glad this explanation was useful for a lot of people!

The kit lens that came with your camera is probably good enough to get started, but you generally want as much aperture as possible for whatever focal length you\u2019re shooting at. I love my Nikon Nikkor 35mm f/1.8 lens, and it\u2019s surprising cheap for the quality. If you\u2019re looking to take some shots of the Milky Way (or any similarly wide shots), something like that or another low f-ratio wide angle lens would work well. The Rokinon 135mm f/2 lens is very highly regarded if you want a longer lens, but you\u2019d definitely need a solid tracker to get any nice shots with such a hefty lens at that focal length. \n\nIt depends on what you want to shoot, but you\u2019ll feel pretty limited pretty quickly if you don\u2019t use a tracker at all. If you live near a relatively dark site, you could take some nice wide-field Milky Way or constellation shots without a tracker (taking lots of short photos of a few seconds each, depending on where what you\u2019re shooting is in the sky and your focal length), but it\u2019s very difficult to do anything more without a mount. The mount is pretty much always the most important part of your rig, and going from a camera + tripod to any basic tracker is a huge upgrade. If you\u2019re looking to get into widefield shots, check out something like the iOptron SkyGuider Pro/SkyTracker Pro or the SkyWatcher Star Adventurer. If you want to take small FOV shots of specific deep sky objects, those mounts may work for some large telephoto lenses (up to 300mm or so, probably), but if you\u2019re planning on going further (e.g. shooting through a telescope), you\u2019d need a much heftier mount like an Orion Sirius or Atlas.

The subjunctive is used with [certain verbs and expressions](https://www.lawlessspanish.com/grammar/verbs/subjunctive/) that convey doubt/possibility, [some adjective clauses](https://www.lawlessspanish.com/grammar/verbs/subjunctive-with-adjective-clauses/),[ certain conjunctions](https://www.lawlessspanish.com/grammar/verbs/subjunctive-with-conjunctions/), and some \"[if clauses](https://www.lawlessspanish.com/grammar/si-clauses-conditionals/)\", as in the screenshot in this post. The thing that all of these usages have in common is that there's some element of uncertainty, doubt, etc. The subjunctive has to do with how the speaker feels toward what they're saying -- it expresses [modality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_modality) (hence the name \"the subjunctive mood\", one of several \"[grammatical moods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_mood)\"). The mood of a verb shows whether the speaker is conveying a fact vs. a command, a doubt, a desire, etc.\n\nThe reason it might seem so foreign to English speakers is because we use the subjunctive less commonly than in Spanish, and it often looks the same as other verb conjugations. E.g. \"If I had a billion dollars, I'd buy a private jet.\" In this case, the speaker is talking about the present tense: \"If I had a billion dollars with me right now in the present, I would buy a private jet.\" So \"had\" isn't expressing something that happened in the past (even though it looks the same as the past tense), it's actually an example of the subjunctive mood in English.

Since planets are so small and fuzzy, you need to capture hundreds or even thousands of frames and later let your computer choose the best frames to stack them into a sharper and cleaner image. Usually, DSLRs aren't great for taking video like this, because whenever you shoot video it downsamples the image from full resolution to 1920x1080. Since planets are going to be really tiny in your field of view, this won't work very well since you'd be losing a lot of data. But some cameras have a \"crop video\" mode, where instead of taking a lower-quality video of your camera's full view, it takes a high-quality video of a very small portion of your camera's view (generally 640 x 480 pixels, which sounds small, but is more than enough). This is perfectly fine for planetary imaging, since the planet takes up a very small portion of your field of view anyway. The Canon T2i has \"crop video\" built in as one of its video modes in settings, but I'm not sure about the T5i. There are some programs like [BackyardEOS](https://www.otelescope.com/store/category/2-backyardeos/) that might allow you to take videos this way if you plug your camera into your computer, even if it's not explicitly available in the camera's settings. Point is, your camera is probably just fine to start out doing this sort of thing.\n\nAnd I think you'd definitely be able to get a sharp image of Saturn with a $300 scope. [This image](https://www.reddit.com/r/astrophotography/comments/d56vk0/saturn_taken_91519/) was taken with a $150 scope + a 2x barlow lens for $30 with a similar camera to yours (on a night with unusually good [seeing](https://www.cleardarksky.com/csk/)) and even though it's a bit fuzzy, you can make out the Cassini Division. With a scope twice as good I'm sure you'd be able to take something you're proud of. But if you're able to, I'd recommend spending a bit more to get something properly \"good\" instead of just \"good enough\" so that you don't reach the limits of your gear too quickly.\n\nOne thing to keep in mind is that Saturn is starting to set earlier and earlier. Once it gets dark, Saturn is already quite close to the horizon, so you'd have more atmosphere to shoot through than if it were high in the sky, causing more atmospheric distortion and a fuzzier image.\n\nEdit: [demo of why stacking is necessary](https://imgur.com/a/H2Gsslb)\n\nAlso, check out [this post](https://qu.reddit.com/r/astrophotography/comments/devwh7/saturn/) -- a single shot from an iPhone through a $300 scope, and [this one](https://qu.reddit.com/r/astrophotography/comments/cpfnry/saturn_from_august_10th/), with basically the exact same setup (smartphone, Orion XT6) that used stacking.

Are you talking about the contrast between the dark vignetting on the edges and the bright center, or the very faint ring around the middle? I think both of them are probably caused by an imperfect lens \u2014 astrophotography really reveals all the minor faults in all equipment, especially when it comes to flatness of field. Any lens will cause vignetting, and I\u2019ve had a problem with a large, faint halo appearing in the middle of some of my images too, and I\u2019m not exactly sure what causes it. Maybe a nearby light that\u2019s diffusing over the lens weirdly? There are a couple ways to correct for it, though: \n\n1.\tThe ideal way: flat frames. I think Sequator calls them vignetting frames, but they solve for any imperfections in light transmission, including stuff like dust motes on the lens/mirror, vignettes, potentially the \u201cdonut\u201d issue you\u2019re having. Basically, you take a picture of a completely evenly-lit field (computer screen, morning sky, etc) with diffused light (something like a t-shirt over the lens, etc). Then, a program like Sequator takes the information from those pictures and corrects your star images. Google \u201castrophotography flat flames\u201d or similar for more info on how to take/use them.\n2.\tThe less ideal way: post-processing. I personally have had a lot of trouble properly capturing flat frames with just a DSLR lens \u2014 they always seem to overcorrect, dust is in different positions, etc \u2014 so I usually go this route, but taking real flat frames is definitely better if you can take them properly. Use a program like RawTherapee or Photoshop or PixInsight or any photo editor to try to remove any vignetting and the halo in the middle (DynamicBackgroundExtraction from PixInsight and GradientXTerminator for Photoshop are expensive but powerful tools). Most have some sort of vignetting correction which might fix your issues. You can also try to make a \u201csynthetic flat\u201d where you use your lights (star images) to artificially create flat frames. It can potentially be more effective than background correction/vignetting correction but is more labor-intensive.\n\nAlso, increasing the contrast after the fact probably made the halo more pronounced, especially on a jpeg in a phone app. What\u2019s it like before any edits?", "created_utc": "1570054773.0", "edited": "False", "id": "f287vbd", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_da7fxh", "parent_id": "t1_f27oitz", "score": "1", "subreddit": "astrophotography", "subreddit_id": "t5_2raop"}, {"author": "abundantmediocrity", "body": "The idea of having a lightweight and completely portable SkyGuider setup that doesn\u2019t need any extra external batteries is really appealing to me, but I\u2019ll definitely be on the lookout for one of those mounts on cloudynights, then.

Generally, you want to follow the \u201cRule of 500\u201d: divide 500 by your focal length to find the longest exposure time where the stars aren\u2019t visibly trailing. So if you\u2019re shooting at 55mm, you can take exposures roughly 10 seconds long before there\u2019s noticeable star trailing because of the earth\u2019s rotation. Of course, this is just a general guideline, so once you\u2019ve learned how to focus, take some test shots and see how long you can expose for while keeping the stars sharp. If you want to expose for as long as possible and you don\u2019t have a star tracker, it\u2019s usually good to use a wider angle lens (e.g. your 18mm lens, since 500/18 \u2248 30 seconds). If you take a 30 second exposure at 250mm, or even 55mm, the rotation of the stars (or rotation of the earth, I guess) becomes way more apparent because of the long focal length. \n\nAs for focusing, make sure you\u2019re doing everything in fully manual mode. The sky is far, far too dim with too little contrast for autofocus to work properly. Even if the camera appears to autofocus on a star, it usually won\u2019t actually release the shutter and take a picture until it detects enough light (or until you switch the focus into manual mode). There should be a switch on your lens that changes the lens focusing mode from auto to manual. [Here\u2019s a good video on how to focus on the stars. ](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=P5UIgOwReMQ) Make sure you\u2019re focusing the camera at the same focal length at which you\u2019ll take pictures.\n\nAlso, since you\u2019re so close to the city (I suffer from the same problem :/ ) try looking up \u201cstar trail astrophotography\u201d and see if it\u2019s something you\u2019d be into.

You should be able to check the histogram of each picture you've taken right from the camera. I have a Nikon so check your camera's manual to be sure, but I think you can press the info button while looking at your image to scroll through between just the photo, photo with statistics (exposure time, ISO, etc), and photo with histogram. The histogram basically just displays the brightness of your picture in a graph -- see [this website](https://digital-photography-school.com/how-to-read-and-use-histograms/). How bright your exposure time depends on the aperture (how much light is let in), ISO (how much the light signal gets amplified), and exposure time (how long the picture is being taken).\n\nBut since you're just getting started, getting the ideal histogram doesn't really matter. Like the other guy said, it'll be difficult to over-expose your images with just a camera on a tripod. The biggest challenge you'll face is exposure time. Since the night sky is extremely dark and even the brightest celestial objects are pretty dim, you'll want to take the longest exposure images you can and let as much starlight reach your camera sensor as possible (unless you're taking photos of the moon or planets). But because the earth is rotating, the stars will start to streak in just a few seconds. You can use the \"[rule of 500](https://bradycabe.com/blog/2017/2/the-500-and-300-rule-for-photographing-the-night-sky)\" to give you an estimate of how long you can expose for -- if you're shooting with a lens at 50mm, for example, you can take a 500/50 = 10 second-long exposure before the stars start to noticeably trail. It should be a pretty good guideline unless you specifically want to take star-trail images like [this one](http://ppcdn.500px.org/80047273/5e2d094e5f2b604c6b2a59a5da278b6443f8c2dd/5.jpg).\n\nAlso, very first time you try to take some astrophotos, getting the camera properly in focus will probably be tricky -- see [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejgr5Bjn6oI).\n\nSo, to answer your question, you should expose for as long as possible while still keeping the stars sharp (for now, at least, since you're just using a camera and tripod). Astrophotography is definitely one of the most technical types of photography, so it may take a lot of reading and experimenting to figure out how everything works, but keep at it and you'll see why we all love this stuff.

[Questions 3 - 26](http://www.newadvent.org/summa/1002.htm#article3), and really the entirety of the First Part of the Summa, are directed towards understanding this God-like, unmoved-mover entity as the Christian God (in his goodness, simplicity, power, knowledge, etc., but this doesn't matter in a conversation about the five ways).\n\nYour summary looks good but I'm gonna change it a little bit to emphasize some of this important stuff.\n\n1. Some things are in motion. I don't think there's any denying this first premise; obviously, things around us are changing and moving, and for this argument it's not even necessary that all things be moving.\n\n2. All things in motion were put into motion by another thing. Also undeniable, I think -- nothing can come into existence without some cause.\n\n3. Everything that moves is moved by some previous mover, and that previous mover is moved by another, and that previous previous mover is moved by another, etc; this follows necessarily from #2. This leaves us with two options: either this causal chain goes to infinity, or there's some original cause that started the chain that paradoxically was not caused by anything else.\n\n4. This chain of \"moved\" and \"movers\" can't go on to infinity. As far as we know, the universe is finitely old.\n\n5. There must be some \"first mover\" that is itself not moved by anything prior, and we give this First Mover the name \"God.\" \n\nAnd you're right, this first mover does break the rules of causality, and that's the point. Aquinas' argument is that because of the way we observe the universe to work, there must be some original cause that itself is unmoved for everything else to follow the \"rules\" nicely. There exists an unchanging being that is the first cause of all change and is eternal. Without this being, there would be no first cause, and nothing would exist. Since we observe that things move and change, this being must exist. Of course, this \"being\" isn't exactly what Christians mean when they refer to God, but I think being the First Mover counts as the absolute minimum requirement of any monotheistic deity. And like I said above, a big ol' chunk of Aquinas' Summa is dedicated to trying to explain why the Christian God is this First Mover.\n\nAlso explaining theological treatises on a meme page is pretty tiring so I think I'll check out here lol.

What type of astrophotography are you most interested in?

You can get some sweet images with a relatively setup cheap like this -- see [one](https://hw.reddit.com/r/astrophotography/comments/ac845v/2018_pleiades/), [two](https://pa.reddit.com/r/astrophotography/comments/a89k40/milky_way_core_at_35mm/).

I don't know how up-to-date it is, but the cheapest recommended setup there falls right into your budget. You can also get a [nice telescope for under $300](https://wisepick.org/best-telescope-under-300/) and still take some pretty solid pictures of the moon and brighter planets with your phone through the eyepiece or with a [cheap adapter](https://www.amazon.com/Gosky-Universal-Phone-Adapter-Mount/dp/B013D2ULO6#customerReviews). Honestly, this might be the best option, since it'd suck to invest a lot of money into this hobby and (possibly) end up not using it.

I'd definitely recommend trying the 45 day trail - the price is pretty steep (~$270!) but it's such a step up from anything I've used before. You can also download Photoshop CS2 for free. And as for rnc-color-stretch, make sure to remove the gradient as best you can before stretching (I'm sure there's a video somewhere that explains how you can do that with something like PS CS2 or Gimp). Data collection is just half the process :)\n\nSteps I took for the above image:\n\n- DynamicCrop: Cropped a few pixels from each side cause it looked like there were some artifacts\n\n- LinearFit: Ran a script (NoiseEvaluation) to see which RGB channel has the lowest noise. Split the image into its three color channels and linearly fit the higher noise channels to the lowest one to correct for differences in response to light. Recombined the channels with ChannelCombination\n\n- DynamicBackgroundExtraction: Extract the background gradient and subtract it from the image (this is one of those tools where you can reallllly see the power of PixInsight)\n\n- BackgroundNeutralization: Color corrected the background to make it less colorful\n\n- SCNR (SubtractiveChromaticNoiseReduction): Reduces chromatic noise of a specific channel, usually green. You can see a strong green cast in your processed image - there's virtually no green in space (no green stars, very few green nebulae) so any very green pixels are probably noise.\n\n- TGVDenoise (total generalized variation de-noise): Generated a high attenuation inverted luminance mask (described [here](https://jonrista.com/the-astrophotographers-guide/pixinsights/effective-noise-reduction-part-2/)) so that TGVD'll act more strongly on darker areas of the image and very little on the bright parts to get rid of high-frequency background noise. \"Recovering piecewise smooth multichannel images by minimization of convex functionals with total generalized variation penalty\" is the title of one of the papers describing how total generalized variation works so I'm guessing it does some pretty complicated stuff.\n\n- MultiscaleMedianTransform: Similar process to TGVDenoise (described on that same website) with a very protective mask to target and remove the low and medium frequency noise in the background/darker areas. TGVDenoise usually leaves a mottled-looking background and this does pretty well to fix that (but you can still see some mottling in the background in the final image). \n\n- StarMask and ColorSaturation: Generated a star mask and inverted it to only target the stars and selectively desaturated them in light blue and magenta. I think this killed the star color in the stars that are actually blue (and ended up looking grey/white), but it greatly reduced the colorful halos from chromatic aberration. \n\n- ArcsinhStretch: A tool to stretch the data while keeping all the original R,G,B color ratios in every pixel the same to retain the color. It does pretty well to keep the background dark and to stretch just the nebulosity. Don't really know how this works but somehow inverse hyperbolic sine functions are at work here?\n\n- MaskedStretch: Another way to stretch only the brighter parts of the image and not the background. It generates a mask to only apply a stretch to the lighter parts of the image, stretches slightly, generates another mask with the newly stretched image, stretches it slightly again, etc. for at least a few dozen iterations.\n\n- HistogramTransformation: Also used this to stretch - just pulled the midpoint of the image down to increase the brightness of everything a bit. Stretched the data with various masks to protect the background and used these three tools a couple times each until it looked pretty.\n\n- LocalHistogramEqualization: This enhances the contrast in similar brightness, low contrast areas to reveal more detail. I think it takes into account the brightness level so as to not sharpen the background. \n\n- CurvesTransformation: Generated a luminance mask to target only the darkest parts of the image (background) and pulled the curve down to darken it a bit more. \n\n- HDRMultiscaleTransform: Boosts the dynamic range. Used this on the brighter parts of the image with a mask to bring the core of M42 down a little bit since the stretching had blown it out slightly. \n\n- ColorSaturation: Kept the same mask as the previous step to increase saturation in the stars and nebulae. I think I made sure to saturate every color except for magenta and light blue in order to get rid of the chromatic aberration once and for all (but some magenta is still visible on the brightest stars, whoops)\n\n- ACDNR (Adaptive Contrast-Driven Noise Reduction): Final pass of noise reduction at the end. This smooths out the image and tries to protect edges to stop major structures from getting blurred out. \n\nI'm so envious of the dark skies you got to image this at, taking pictures in bortle 7-8 suburban/urban transition skies is pretty tough haha.

Identification \n\nInstrumental is used for identifying/defining a noun in terms of another noun, using the verb _by\u0107_. For example:\n\n- On jest Polak**iem** (He is Polish/he is a Pole)\n- Ona jest nauczycielk**\u0105** (She is a teacher)\n- Tygrys jest kot**em** (The tiger is a cat)\n\nImportant note: when the subject is 'to' (like in \"to jest m\u0119\u017cczyzna\"), you do not use the instrumental for the second verb. It stays in the nominative.\n\n#2. Transport \n\nCan be used for showing what transportation was used to get somewhere. \n\n- Jad\u0119 autobus**em** (I am going by bus)\n- Lec\u0119 samolot**em** (I'm flying by plane)\n\n#3. Instrument \n\nThis is what you were talking about earlier - defining the means by which something is done. \n\n- Jem widelc**em** (I am eating with a fork)\n- Pisz\u0119 o\u0142\u00f3wk**iem** (I am writing with a pencil)\n\n#4. Time \n\nCan be used to tell the time during which something happened \n\n- M\u00f3wi\u0142em wczoraj wieczor**em** (I was talking yesterday evening/last night)\n- Spa\u0142em zim**\u0105** (I slept in the winter)\n- Rank**iem** (in the morning)\n\n#5. Verbs that take the Instrumental \n\nSome verbs just take the instrumental instead of the accusative or any other case. \n\n- kierowa\u0107 samochod**em** (to direct the car) \n- Ona interesuje si\u0119 matematyk**\u0105** (She is interested in mathematics)\n\n#6. Prepositions \n\nThere are also some prepositions that take the accusative! \n\n- Przed pude\u0142kiem (in front of the box)\n- Mi\u0119dzy budynkami (between the buildings)\n\nI think that covers all/most of the possible uses for the instrumental.

English has mostly lost this case system, but it remains in some pronouns. For example:\n\n- **He** drove the car.\n- **His** shoes are blue.\n- I like **him**.\n\nEverything in bold is the same word, just with a different case. In the first one, \"he\" is the subject and stays in the default subjective case (also called nominative case). In the second example, \"he\" owns something, so the word has to change to the possessive case (also called genitive case), \"his.\" In the third example, \"he\" is the direct object (the thing receiving the action of the verb), so \"he\" turns into the objective case (also called accusative case), \"him.\"\n\nIn those examples, \"he\" changes its form depending on what purpose it serves  in the sentence.\n\nThe case system is a really important part of a lot of languages. Most Slavic languages, German, Greek, Korean, Japanese, Baltic languages, Sanskrit, Tamil, Latin, and quite a few more all have a case system to a certain degree.

I'll try to answer each question in order.\n\nIt depends on what you think is an \"acceptable level.\" That image is very noisy, but he had to sacrifice low noise to bring out the faint nebula because he had such a low integration time for something so dim (just 12 minutes). Using a de-noising tool should be avoided if possible; it can throw away the faint details and sometimes give the image an oil painting-like look. The best way to lower noise is to stack more images and take longer exposures. I think there's a section in the wiki that talks about the signal-to-noise (SNR) ratio. There will almost always be some noise, and the background will not be completely black (unless you clip your histogram, which you should also avoid doing).\n\n\nIf you really want to image DSOs now, continue to experiment with settings. See how long you can expose without getting any trailing. Try some brighter targets, like the Orion Nebula that you mentioned and other bright Messier objects. However, I think you should not do DSOs until you buy a DSLR. Shooting DSOs sounds pretty difficult with your telescope/webcam. I think that your best bet for bigger/brighter objects would be to piggyback your future camera on top of your telescope and use a wide-ish lens (200 or 300mm for small things). That way the slightly inaccurate tracking will be much less noticeable, and you might be able to get images up to 30 seconds before trailing/field rotation appear.\n\n\nYou should definitely continue to learn your way around AS!2 and Registax for planetary/lunar imaging. There are some great tutorials by wwgeb on YouTube like [this one](http://youtu.be/Ci_aMmO4DBA). From what I've heard your scope is perfectly capable of making some nice planetary images. If you're planning to continue with DSOs definitely learn how to use DSS (the 'DSO stacking' section of the wiki is a great place to start) and basic post processing. You can also download an old version of Photoshop (CS2) [from here](https://www.adobe.com/cfusion/entitlement/index.cfm?loc=en&e=cs2_downloads) for free! You'll need an adobe account. It's from 2005 so it's not the best but it's still a damn fine processing tool for the price of zero dollars. Learn how to stretch the histogram, enhance contrast, bring out faint details, etc. Sometimes people link their raw TIF file in their posts here. If you want, download them and practice processing to see how much detail you can bring out. \n\n\nTo be honest, I can't really say if you could get comparable images. I have never used a webcam for astrophotography nor have I used an SCT, but I think getting images like that would be difficult without some pretty serious tracking with the scope that you have. Using the piggyback method I mentioned earlier and you probably will be able to but I can't guarantee it. [This guy has a telescope from the same lineup as yours, piggybacked his DSLR on top, and produced some really great photos.](https://m.reddit.com/r/astrophotography/comments/42trpp/its_2016_lets_share_some_setups/czdqgo4). \n\nI really don't know about webcam settings. I'm sure the YouTube channel wwgeb mentioned earlier could help with that, I think he has a firecapture settings tutorial. Your images (through your telescope) will not look like that. That's a pretty wide view (probably less than 100mm, can't really tell). If you're talking about the brightness/detail of the galaxies, then... Maybe. Somebody else here who's had experience with SCTs can help you out there. Again, I think you'll get nice DSOs with a piggyback setup. \n\nI'm not sure what the gain should be or how it compares with ISO, but cranking it all the way up will most likely make the image very noisy. Look up what the sweet spot is for you camera. Also: don't decrease exposure time! Yes, more exposures make a better image but so do longer exposures. Don't necessarily use the longest possible exposure you can but see how long you can go without star trails or field rotation.\n\nNow this may not be the best advice since I'm also pretty new to this hobby, but the TL;DR is:\n\nKeep shooting lunar/planetary stuff and get as good as you can. When you get a DSLR experiment with setups and try piggybacking it to get long exposures for DSOs. \n\nEdit: [Here's a comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/astrophotography/comments/18bns8/celestron_8se_dslr_mounting_questions/c8dhk96) that says how to shoot DSOs with an 8se and a DSLR.
