I know it\u2019s not easy in this day and age to be in comfortable with yourself but I promise you that fad diets and weight loss goals that are not recommended by a medical professional are extremely harmful for individuals under the age of 18. Dieting and restriction set you up for a lifetime of a bad relationship with food and most people who diet end up gaining more weight back because of how it messes up their perception of food. You are a human being, and a young one at that. Your body needs different things than an adult\u2019s body, particularly more. Teenagers need at least 2,200 calories a day due to the rate your body is growing and developing! \n\nIf you read all of this and truly wholly think, \u201cI can\u2019t do that, I am still uncomfortable with my appearance and my body,\u201d you especially should spend a lot of time taking care of yourself emotionally and practicing self love, self respect, and self care. You are more than a body, more than looking attractive at a few angles. Losing weight seems like the answer but being kind to yourself is vastly more important. \n\nYour body, like any other human\u2019s, will carry you through so many seasons of life. Sometimes those seasons will cause your weight to go up or down. This is entirely normal. People who are perfectly in shape their whole lives, put a *lot* of work into maintaining that aesthetic. It\u2019s not effortless and it\u2019s not something most people would enjoy doing forever. Speaking as an adult, most of us feel our best eating a little more greens with regular moderate exercise like walking or running or biking.\n\nBottom line, you do not need to lose weight, you need to lose the shame that you feel for having a very normal body. And in 10-15 years,  you\u2019ll be surprised at how many high school athletes who will have swapped their six packs for beer guts. Focus on growing yourself as a person, take care of them, love them, and no matter how your body looks, you will be content with who *you* are.
