For reference, a black belt takes around 10-15 years of dedicated training and competition. Does that mean a black belt knows everything? No, but they are an expert in that field. A blue belt represents an understanding and basic ability to implement all fundamentals, but is by no means an expert.\n\nI think this can, and should be applied to other fields as well. Of course, that doesn't mean that a given black belt is by definition better than a given blue belt in a given situation, but it shows a theoretic and practical understanding of the subject on general.\n\nHow you'd implement that for programming I have no idea, but theoretically it could work.", "created_utc": "1598210117.0", "edited": "False", "id": "g2m4j3b", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_if0j4l", "parent_id": "t3_if0j4l", "score": "1", "subreddit": "webdev", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qs0q"}, {"author": "DRac_XNA", "body": "This hurt to read.", "created_utc": "1597924189.0", "edited": "False", "id": "g27cnza", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_id10g2", "parent_id": "t1_g26q43x", "score": "2", "subreddit": "Bass", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qpc3"}, {"author": "DRac_XNA", "body": "And all in a song about wanking!", "created_utc": "1597856842.0", "edited": "False", "id": "g24ci3f", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_icgoww", "parent_id": "t1_g22r98d", "score": "5", "subreddit": "musictheory", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qrjj"}, {"author": "DRac_XNA", "body": "I think legend is too strong.
