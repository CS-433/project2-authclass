These arguments have been rehearsed so often that they have become nauseating. ... Their purpose in citing these verses is to win favor in the eyes of the Gentiles by demonstrating that they believe the statement of the Koran that Mohammed was mentioned in the Torah. But the Muslims themselves put no faith in their own arguments, they neither accept nor cite them, because they are manifestly so fallacious. Inasmuch as the Muslims could not find a single proof in the entire Bible nor a reference or possible allusion to their prophet which they could utilize, they were compelled to accuse us saying, \"You have altered the text of the Torah, and expunged every trace of the name of Mohammed therefrom.\" They could find nothing stronger than this ignominious argument the falsity of which is easily demonstrated to one and all by the following facts. First, Scripture was translated into Syriac, Greek, Persian and Latin hundreds of years before the appearance of Mohammed. The motive for their accusation lies therefore, in the absence of any allusion to Mohammed in the Torah.\n\nEdit: fixed formatting and added link.", "created_utc": "1666714832.0", "edited": "False", "id": "itqmx3m", "is_submitter": "True", "link_id": "t3_ycj0i9", "parent_id": "t1_itq6vpz", "score": "1", "subreddit": "islam", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhbp"}, {"author": "IronAlcoholic", "body": "I don't know what to tell you, I am friends with lots of converts and they converted through various denominations.", "created_utc": "1666706390.0", "edited": "False", "id": "itq1wk5", "is_submitter": "True", "link_id": "t3_ycj0i9", "parent_id": "t1_itq149w", "score": "1", "subreddit": "islam", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhbp"}, {"author": "IronAlcoholic", "body": ">You will never be accepted into the Jewish faith because no matter what you do your mother is not Jewish. \n\nJudaism has a form of conversion and is a multi-ethnic religion.
