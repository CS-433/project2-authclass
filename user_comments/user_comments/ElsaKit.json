I first read the book in high school and I thought Holden was a brilliant character, and I appreciated it even more after I re-read it when I was older than Holden is there.\n\nHe was always very easy to empathize with imo. Just a boy who's very much lost, directionless, isolated and depressed, dealing with a lot more than any kid his age should, trying to navigate life and deal with his own trauma, desperately seeking a connection, all the while going through arguably the toughest period of growing up... A boy who loves his siblings with all his heart, who's sensitive to a point he struggles with the ugliness and pain he sees all around him... He may call people phony, he may complain about stuff all the time, call them mean things, but notice how at the ends of his tirades, he often ends up saying something kind of positive - how he likes it anyway, how it's actually fun... He's a teenager, and a very difficult part of growing up is that things are no longer idealized, simple, black and white and to be taken for granted - you start seeing the cracks, the ugliness, dishonesty, all the greys. And Holden struggles with that. Everything is suddenly deeply flawed, everything bothers him in some way; he's a rebelling teenager, perpetually unsatisfied. But that dissatisfaction largely comes from a place of disillusionment imo. A place of sadness, lost-ness, frustration, confusion, as well as a certain child-like innocence and idealism.. But at the same time, I always felt like a lot of it was just a pose, this persona. Like you said, he had it on for almost every interaction, this \"tough guy act,\" as you call it. But really, I feel that the language he keeps using is stronger than how he actually feels. He cares, he cares a lot. Too much, even. He is thoughtful, sensitive, kind-hearted. He is sad, alone, disappointed in the world as well as himself (notice how he always talks about himself in very negative terms while having nothing but lovely things to say about his siblings).

Why Backman, whyyy do you do this to us... ;-;\n\nSorry, I literally just finished the book and I'm very emotional...\n\nI agree with you completely. Another great testament to Benji's character was at the beginning of Us Against You, when he \"gave\" Maya and Ana the island... and when he approached them to take them there, he wordlessly gave them a hammer so that they'd feel safer walking with him... and when they took the little boat to get there, he just swam beside it, not getting in with them, again helping them feel safe. He didn't say any of those things out loud, he just did them. Benji was many things but he was never selfish. He always fought and loved and cared with all of his heart.\n\nHe was no saint, he could be violent, even if a lot of it was more a desire to harm himself than others; he struggled a lot with others' expectations and perception of him, becoming what they thought him to be. He had to fight so, so so much, and the most difficult battles were very much internal. He was in a lot of pain and didn't know what to do with it. But his heart was always in the right place. He immediately sided with Maya, despite the fact he loved Kevin deeply and dearly, because he knew that what Kevin did to her was horrible and unforgiveable. He took beatings or blame for others because he knew they'd be in more trouble. He made himself look like a coward, risking the wrath of very dangerous people, in order to save a kid from getting hurt in a fight. The list could go on... And he did all of that automatically and wordlessly, never expecting anything in return. All he wanted was to just be able to play hockey, just be accepted, just be free to be himself.

This boy has already had to go through so fcking much, and he fought and fought and fought and by the end of Us Against You, we're actually leaving him in a hopeful place...

It wasn't that I didn't think I could do wrong and everything was always everyone else's fault, it was just vicious self-defence. It was so difficult for me to openly admit I was wrong because it made me feel so much shame that it was almost unbearable. Idk where it came from, maybe some insecurity or a deeply ingrained need for perfection (I've always been a massive perfectionist...), and I know it's bad, I know there's nothing shameful about admitting a wrong - on the contrary - and that's what I try to teach any kid I interact with, but it's hard work and I can tell you that it's still a struggle sometimes. I did often feel terrible and was aware that I was in the wrong, but I was just stubbornly shielding myself from experiencing all that shame; just flat out saying it was pretty much impossible at times. But it did make me feel terrible about myself.\n\nI don't guilt trip people, I'm not trying to shift the blame to them. But sometimes apologizing is the hardest thing ever. It depends, it strangely differs a lot situation to situation. Sometimes it's not difficult at all. When it's serious, when I unintentionally hurt someone, it's surprisingly easy. I don't want to make anyone feel bad in my place, this is purely my problem that I need to work out. It usually happens with smaller things, go figure. And I did definitely get a lot better over the years. An area where it's still difficult sometimes is with my parents. No idea why. Still trying to figure that one out. But I am working on it. I think the key for me is trying to keep as self-aware and honest with myself as possible, and recognize when it's happening - ie. when I mess up but can't bring myself to say it.

It was the first time in my binge that I had to take a little break, I was kinda depressed for about a day after, or like in a strange daze.

It's hard to watch honestly, just comparing the Ted from episode 1 with the Ted from Time Travellers and after... it makes me sad.\n\nAlso, it's probably the first episode that significantly alludes to Tracy's death.

Please read...\n\nYou said one thing right. He is \"sick\", but in the sense that it's essentially a mental condition that he has no control over.\n\nPedophilia is HEAVILY stigmatized, for very understandable reasons (to an extent it has to be) but it's to the point where people essentially can't ever reach out to anyone about having these feelings without being completely discarded and demonized by the society and their loved ones. It's a social death sentence. I feel the need to stress that being a pedophile DOES NOT EQUAL being a child molester. Being a pedophile does not equal being a monster.\n\nImagine you're going through life, normal decent human, never hurt anyone and never want to, and gradually you realize that you are physically (or even romantically) attracted only to minors. Imagine what that would do to your psyche and self-perception. Again, it's not something you choose, you have zero control over your attraction. What you DO have control over are your actions, but people don't care about that. These people don't even have to do anything bad and are inherently seen as deplorable monsters. There is no legal or morally acceptable way for them to satisfy their feelings and they are often (rightly) afraid to talk to anyone and seek help. Which is a big problem, not only for their own well being but also for any potential victims - it increases the likelihood of the person potentially acting on their feelings. This massive stigmatization is breeding more dangerous people, and access to help and support is the best prevention.\n\n__Please, urge your friend to seek professional help. I don't know what kind of person he is, but if he says he never wants to hurt a child, that's a very good sign. He has no control over how he feels. That alone does not make him evil. The pornography is very bad of course, there is victimization of a child involved*... but in the end that doesn't really change my point. With the right kind of help and support, he might be able to live a normal, fulfilling life without ever being a threat to anyone (in the best case scenario even find a different outlet than his current one...). Urge him to seek help. It's not only help for him, it's also prevention.__ You can look for specialized resources online, I know such things exist in my country.\n\n(*Edit: What qualifies or is used as CP does not necessarily have to involve actual children being actually victimized. AFAIK, it can often be things like \"innocent\" nude or semi-nude pictures that unthinking parents have unwittingly posted online... you'd be surprised how often that used to happen. Nudity is not taboo in many countries, especially with children because it doesn't cross people's minds that it could be sexualized... Not that that makes it completely okay, I personally feel like there is still a level of victimization here, but it's much more gray since the child's life will probably never be touched by it, they'll never even know... IMO, parents really should be educated on this stuff and not post their kids online... but that's a whole other conversation in itself. There is a whole loaded ethical discussion about this subject to be had, way too loaded to get into here. For instance, there had been discussions about AI-generated CP as a way to offer an outlet to pedophiles while protecting actual children. Would that be ethical? I'm not saying one way or the other, I don't have all the answers. It's a very complicates issue (and not the point of this comment; just wanted to point this aspect out because it is an important facet of the conversation). \n\nEither way, our priority should be first and foremost protecting children, and secondly, other people's health and well-being; providing access to suitable help and resources is the best way to achieve both.)", "created_utc": "1661760107.0", "edited": "1661762007.0", "id": "im8cblw", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_x07cc3", "parent_id": "t3_x07cc3", "score": "9", "subreddit": "TrueOffMyChest", "subreddit_id": "t5_2yuqy"}, {"author": "ElsaKit", "body": "Oh god yeah, that's them", "created_utc": "1661757802.0", "edited": "False", "id": "im89o4g", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_x0257s", "parent_id": "t1_im75agc", "score": "1", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i"}, {"author": "ElsaKit", "body": "I would nope out of this earth straight fucking away if there were mosquitoes as big as whales, I tell you\n\nI've always really liked and been fascinated by insects but these motherfuckers, for whatever reason, disgust me to no end.

This makes it very difficult to talk about non-binary people or someone whose gender I don't know; linguistically, it's pretty much impossible. I suppose the next best thing would be to use the plural, but that just sounds incredibly unnatural and confusing in Czech (partly probably also due to the fact that in the past, a similar form of address did exist and was incredibly formal, like for kings and such, so it sounds quite ridiculous when used nowadays); (*tbf even the plural is technically gendered, but the masculine is used as default/neutral).

It was all about religion and I just wanted to get to the actual story. It still made me think though. Cut to now, and that part is what stuck with me for all these years. It never left me. This book's perspective on religion really struck a deep cord with me. I keep thinking about Pi running home to pray to his Hindu gods to thank them for introducing him to Jesus (may be misremembering slightly but I think that was the gist of it). This boy comes across three different major religions - Hinduism, Islam and Christianity - and he embraces all of them without ever feeling like there should be a problem with it. Because that's how I felt and nobody ever put it into words in such a way. Why do these things have to be contradictions? Why do we have to fight and wage wars in the name of religion? Pi could unproblematically integrate these different thought systems. Why can't we at least try to be more accepting...?\n\nThis is a simplification, and also like I said, it's been 10 years and I was young.

The *second* things got difficult, the second he had to face the painful reality of how much of a piece of crap he had been to Robby and how much he hurt him, he chickened out. Like, I know it's hard, okay. It's really painful because in facing Robby, Johnny has to face his own failures, they are shoved right in his face, and yeah, that hurts. But dammit...! Imagine how hurt Robby is...! Shouldn't Johnny be reasonably expected to be the bigger person here, to do the bigger part of the work to mend the relationship?\n\nConsidering how much pain he's caused his son, how much damage to their relationship, if he truly means it, if he's serious about making it up to Robby and being back in his life - then he has to work his *ass* off for him. He has to be consistent. He has to work *hard*, and not give up as soon as things get difficult. Because they will be difficult, and slow. There is no shortcut to fixing a relationship you have so deeply damaged. Robbie - very understandably and justifiably so - is going to be resentful, he will lash out and push him away, because he has been hurt so much by Johnny already. He can't trust him, and he has no reason to give him another chance. Johnny has never given him a reason to believe he's actually changed and would be there for him, that things would be any different, that he's willing to put in any genuine effort. In fact, Johnnny has only ever abandoned and disappointed him. Like, when Robby was in juvie - where the fck was Johnny?? He didn't visit him even once! And when he did, it was only for Miguel...! You call that trying? No, not good enough, Johnny is failing Robby over and over again, and we're expecting the kid to be the bigger person, forgive him just like that, do the hard work instead of Johnny?\n\nNo way. Robbie deserves a dad who is willing to fight for him, work is ass off for him, be there for him, consistently and reliably, and not run away as soon as his feelings get hurt.\n\n(Also, nobody is suggesting he should cut Miguel off. Their relationship has been really good for both of them, they love each other, they have helped each other grow as people, Johnny shouldn't have to abandon Miguel in favour of Robby. But he can't keep abandoning Robby in favour of Miguel, either. Which is what he has been doing so far. When push came to shove, he always chose Miguel, because it's just so much easier than facing his failure. And frankly, I believe that at some point Robby should come first... he has never been the priority in Johnny's life and he deserves to be.)\n\n(Sorry for such a tangent lol)", "created_utc": "1657901793.0", "edited": "False", "id": "iga3qs2", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_vzah3d", "parent_id": "t1_ig8f5ez", "score": "6", "subreddit": "cobrakai", "subreddit_id": "t5_3ncyn"}, {"author": "ElsaKit", "body": "This!!!", "created_utc": "1657900012.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ig9z7fx", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_vzah3d", "parent_id": "t1_ig9whsm", "score": "3", "subreddit": "cobrakai", "subreddit_id": "t5_3ncyn"}, {"author": "ElsaKit", "body": "I completely agree with you.

When push came to shove, he always chose Miguel, and every single time he tried to do something for his actual damn son, he gave up as soon as things got tough.\n\nAnd yeah, like you said, that's probably the most frustrating part - he does try hard for Miguel, he is willing to go the distance for him. Not for Robbie though. Miguel loves him already, he treats him kindly and gives him the benefit of the doubt, second chances, so it's easy; but with Robbie, it's hard work. So he gives up before even trying, or he takes the path of least resistance. It's so selfish and cowardly...! Like when Robbie was in juvie, where the f*ck was Johnny??? He only came to visit him once - and guess why?? For fcking Miguel...!? It makes me so angry. How is Robbie supposed to feel?? His resentment and the feeling that nobody's got his back are completely justified; that's what Johnny's been proving to him over and over again. He keeps abandoning and disappointing him. How could Robbie ever trust him again...?\n\nYeah, it's cool that he regrets f*cking up with Robbie, but if you're not willing to work HARD to make it right, it means absolutely nothing. You chicken out the second it gets hard. Robbie deserves so much better... Damn.\n\nIt's really frustrating. I want to see him work his *ass* off for Robbie.

I do wish they reigned it in a little. A lot of the minor ones didn't really land, sometimes it was a bit awkward, but the worst offence imo was that they crammed the jokes even in the serious or heartfelt scenes, which just completely took you out of the scene. Gorr/Bale was so good and terrifying, I just wanted to enjoy his creepiness; but they kept making quips at him and it just didn't work a lot of the time. It kept undermining the scene, the stakes... and that's such a shame because the stakes were really high! And the underlying story was really serious and heartfelt, it was about Thor trying to heal from everything that's happened to him, all the loss, and open up his heart again... and Jane's arc on top of that... so much heavy stuff, but it didn't really get a chance to land properly because it kept being undercut with a crazy amount of jokes and quips... I don't think it's a coincindence that probably the best scene in the movie (and damn, *such* a great scene...) was when Gorr managed to gag Thor & co. so they couldn't keep quipping at him and the creepy, scary scene could finally happen uninterrupted lol. Probably the first time you could actually feel the stakes being high...\n\nI wish they just let the movie breathe for a bit, just sit with the serious moments without desperately trying to MAKE YOU LAUGH. I feel like they did manage that in Ragnarok but for some reason not here, it was pure chaos and insanity. The tonal clashes were a bit jarring at times. I didn't really mind the randomness of the humour tbh. Just the amount. It seemed that the movie couldn't go one minute without a quip.\n\nThat all being said, I still loved it, I laughed a lot, overall had a great time. Some scenes moved me, too.

The only exception to hard consonant-ending words being masculine I could think of (apart from -st words like kost, zlost, strast, past...) is smrt.\n\nAs about the -ev, -el and -ost words, those can easily be either masculine or feminine (p\u00e1nev, tykev, lahev... / tet\u0159ev, jev, n\u00e1lev...; postel, ocel, petr\u017eel... / kostel, v\u00fdst\u0159el, hotel...; kost, zlost, radost... / kompost, most, skvost...). I would also change -ost to just -st, because otherwise it omits words like slast, lest, p\u011bst, etc. that follow the same pattern.\n\nAnd what about consonants that are neither hard nor soft (b, f, l, m, p, s, v, z) - words like kor\u00e1b, srab, slib (m), \u00fapal, smysl, st\u016fl (m), mysl, h\u016fl, Neapol (f), z\u00e1znam, strom (m), zem (f), hlas, n\u00e1pis, les (m), ves, oves, sm\u011bs (f), poryv, z\u00e1liv, od\u011bv (m), obuv, Zbraslav, \u010c\u00e1slav (f), sliz, sr\u00e1z, z\u00e1kaz (m), tvrz, hr\u00e1z, nesn\u00e1z (f)? They seem to be predominantly masculine, but still missing from your chart completely.\n\nTo be quite honest, I really admire your effort but I don't think it's actually making anything easier... I don't think you can come up with rules to explain why, say, postel or ves are feminine but kostel and les are masculine... There's some trends for sure, and you have pinned down a lot of them, but I don't think there's any real merit in trying to fit it all into categories based on some arbitrary rules... I don't think it can be done and tbh the chart feels even more complicated than it all already is, haha.

On a different note, it also has a hearing impaired character who only uses sign language, which is pretty cool!

It can be a teacher, school counsellor, another relative, a friend's parent... whoever. But an adult.\n\nI'm sure there are hotlines available too, and those can be pretty helpful as well because, at least in my country, they are (or at least some of them) anonymous, you are not required to tell them anything specific, and you can always just hang up.. Many are completely free. They can help you come up with a plan, talk with you about your issues and concerns... Unfortunately, I only know about the options in my country (Czechia), so unless you live here, I can't really suggest a specific helpline, I have no idea what options there are where you live.

Just let me give you one piece of advice, as somebody who has been in your position in the past. You take very good care of yourself too. If you can, find some support for yourself as well. Talk to an adult. Even if you think you can handle it, don't underestimate it, pay attention to how you're really doing. Most importantly, don't ever, ever feel like your friend's well-being or life are your responsibility, like they depend on you. They don't; it's very good of you to be there to support your friend, and that's exactly what you can do - support him, be there for him. But there are limits to what you can do. It's not your job to \"save\" him. There are some things out of our control, and it's good to know that, and you need to know that what you are doing is enough. Take care and stay safe!

Probably the most out of all of these.\n\nI honestly don't get why people love it so much. Can somebody please explain to me what makes the movie good in your eyes? Like it was a visual spectacle, it looked cool, sure - but other than that...? I just thought it was incredibly dull and while it had some really cool ideas that it *tried* to explore, in the end the main message/theme was kind of butchered.. \n\nLike you have all this childhood trauma, and you are trying to reconcile your past and your present, forgive yourself and make some kind of peace with what your father put you through... the idea of having to integrate both the good and the bad, I found to be so compelling. It could have been a great take on such a serious subject. But how does the connundrum get solved, you ask? Answer: airbending! That's it, you learned airbending, you're all good now. *What...??* Idk, I just feel like if you want to tackle these heavy subjects in a superhero movie, by all means, go for it, but then you need to treat them really respectfully; most of all, imo, you have to prove that there was a *reason* for your movie specifically to tackle these subjects. Why did you decide to center your movie around dealing with the fallout of parental abuse? What unique/meaningful/... thing did you have to say about the themes...? And if you don't have a good answer to those questions, then just fckn don't make a movie about it... I feel like they picked the themes up, tried them out, and then it was a bit too complex so they just dropped them in favour of a few extra fight(-adjacent) scenes... it felt disrespectful and pointless. If you didn't want to make a movie about this subject, then why did you take this route...??\n\nI personally also found Shang-Chi as a character *incredibly* dull tbh... I feel like he had no real personality and he just didn't manage to draw any emotion out of me... idk\n\nIt might be worth mentioning I've only seen the movie once.

Like the comment before said, kids are getting to this kind of stuff super early now, which is scary... so they need to have proper education there from a very early age. Porn is super misleading and unrealistic, promotes some harmful ideas... I'm not saying explain coitus in detail to preschoolers, but things like helping them form a healthy relationship to their own bodies, have a realistic idea about it, teaching them how to treat someone they like (e.g. not expressing it by bullying them, etc.), the importance of consent... Can'n speak for anyone else but at least in my country, all of that is sorely missing. We never even had sex ed at school, just a few odd lectures about stuff like menstruation for girls, no idea what boys had instead... and then biology lessons later, but that just talks about the anatomy and biology anyway, nothing about sexual health.\n\nYou also want kids to come to you when there's an issue, you want them to talk to you about stuff. So obviously trust is extremely important, a good child-parent relationship can change everything. Parents need to talk to their kids more, about internet and social media, the dangers, teach them how to be safe and responsible, but not just about the internet - the child needs to know you will be there to listen no matter what, that you will support and help them through anything. If you have a relationship based on mutual trust, a lot can be done even in relation to online safety imo.\n\nIt makes me so mad how so many parents nowadays just sit their kids in front of tablets and phones as a way to entertain them, or to get rid of them for a while... It's such a bad practice. And letting young kids have access to the internet while not monitoring where they go and what they do there, sticking a phone to a 10yo just like that, and not discussing things with them, guiding them - so irresponsible!! \n\nOof.

You see women sunbathing topless often (my experience is from Croatia but it's definitely not a one-off).

Just a heads up, generally speaking they won't make things any easier for you, they won't be very accomodating. They don't always speak English either. It's a hassle lol, even for us a lot of the time. But hey, I wouldn't worry about it too much. Bureaucracy sucks ass, but that's not a uniquely Czech thing.

Trust me, nobody actually wants to know what people are truly thinking about them (or not even just necessarily *about* them, this would apply to so many situations...). Many things stay unsaid for very good reasons. Loving people, having friendships, any kind of relationships really, all of that kind of relies on how the people act and treat you, right? On trust. But everybody gets ugly thoughts sometimes. They don't have to mean much if you don't say them out loud/act on them, and you don't say them when you don't want to hurt the other person. But I'm pretty confident that everyone has had a moment where they thought something about a person that would deeply hurt them if they heard it. There are also secrets that are kept for good reasons, that would only cause pain... Things you're just not supposed to know... Idk, there's just so much. You can say that you'd use the ability responsibly, but the thing is you can never know what people are thinking at a given moment - well, until you actually read it, and then it's kinda already too late, you can't \"un-read\" it.

The stories he must have.\n\nI was at a language course abroad last year and I met some incredible people there, the vast majority of which were significantly older than me (I'm your age). The person I befrended the most was a woman in her 60s, a theatre acress and former opera singer btw! Incredible stories, incredible woman. The other one was an older gentleman, he was so great, he pretty much took me and my two friends (as we were the youngest there) under his wing... I exchanged addresses with him before we left. Unfortunately, we didn't get a chance to exchange any letters because shortly after returning home, he sadly passed away... I'm really sad I didn't get to talk to him again.

Part of it is convenience, you just want to be able to say \"I'm this\" or \"I'm that\" and be done with it. You want to avoid confused looks and questions & stuff... Neatly fitting in a box that the larger society can clearly recognize is convenient and makes you feel valid. But it can also be incredibly binding and reductive. You don't need to have a simple, straightforward name for what and who you are, nor do you necessarily need a long, convoluted explanation. I tend to say things like \"I'm leaning towards bi, but I'm still figuring it out,\" or \"I'm open to anything.\" Easy, simple, nothing else needed.\n\nBut like I said, I totally understand that feeling and your point (I have also had a little bit of an identity crisis like that myself not too long ago, so I get it lol). It's one of the reasons I often use the label \"bi\" when I want to make it simple for people. It's a simple and clear answer and it usually doesn't lead to further questions. The truth is, idk whether I prefer men or women, there's a good chance I'm not sexual at all... but saying I'm bi keeps my options as well as the range of my potential partners open, if that makes sense? It means I can just do whatever feels right without feeling like I have to explain myself all the time (of course one can and should just do what feels right regardless of what label they currently use... but the point it that labels can make that harder or easier, depending). This approach might not be right for everyone, but it really works for me. I mostly use the label for other people's sake. As for myself, I think it's important to give myself freedom to figure it out and explore it in my own time. The label is partly for me, it helps in some ways, it feels right at this point in time, but I'm not going to define myself by it and limit myself to it. I'm just me. It's important to keep in mind that things can change, your preferences can change too, you grow, you discover new things about yourself. The fact that you're suddenly attracted to a guy does not make you a fraud. You have all the time in the world to figure yourself out. You're totally fine.\n\nMy advice would be to not rely too heavily on labels in general. Using them can really help sometimes, they have their place for sure, but I don't think anyone should wrap their entire identity around them. It's just one small facet of you, and like I said, it's also not set in stone. You're super young as well, nobody should expect you to have it all figured out. I'm 23 and I'm still learning. And that's okay. Give yourself time and space to explore. There is no one right answer. Use whatever label you feel comfortable with at a particular time, or none at all. Take care of yourself, and best of luck!\n\nAnd sorry this was so long and all over the place...

It was happiness, joy and nostalgia combined.\n\nI'm so glad you liked it. The first half or so is magical, the nature, the mundane things and activities - it makes me so happy too. And the visuals - stunning, right?? I can't get over the animation/art style, no matter how many times I watch it. And that's so sweet that it made you reminisce about your own childhood. I don't have that particular connection to it, but it still manages to make me feel nostalgic. A part of it might be my long-term interest in (traditional) Japanese culture. The feeling I get from this movie is definitely very special and hard to describe.\n\nAnd yeah, knowing Takahata, it was bound to take a somber turn...\n\n>I was just BEGGING for a happy ending at that point.\n\nI KNOW right. It's heartwrenching. What you described is the exact experience. You just *beg* for a happy ending, it seems so close.. I think what makes it so soul-crushing is precisely the first half of the movie. Because you know what kind of life she could have had. You *know* she could have been perfectly happy. She never wanted to be a princess, Takenoko would have been enough. But her father was dead set on giving her a life worthy of a celestial princess... As the movie progresses, you see her happiness dwindling, and you keep waiting for that turn for the better, for her father to realize his mistake, for Sutemaru to find and save her - something! It's so incredibly frustrating because you also know her parents loved her so much and they were genuinly trying to do what's best for her, give her a good life. Only her father got too wrapped up in it that he forgot why he was doing it in the first place... If only he had listened to her. It's so painful because the tragedy was so completely unnecessary and entirely preventable. And they payed the price for forcing onto her a life she never asked for and never wanted. For the sake of \"giving her a good life\", they ruined her happiness and their own... Fuck...\n\nSo I'm right there with you... I have seen it several times and I kid you not, I have never cried more during a movie. Idk what it is about this one specifically that cuts me so deep, I think it's a combination of things, but I cry. A lot. Every single time.\n\nYou know what gets me started, without fail? That music... that *damn* music (Edit: There was supppsed to be a link here, but apparantely this sub doesn't allow youtube links lol.. so just look up \"tennin no ongaku\". Although you probably already know which one I mean lol)... I wouldn't have believed that this cheerful tune could be the saddest thing in the world. I think it's partly the juxtaposition that makes it so.. idk, deadly. But it just kills me.\n\nAhh. Sorry for such a rant, but I can't get enough of this movie. It makes me feel so many things and it's really hard to express it all in just a few words lol.

I've had guy friends who I could never even imagine seeing in a romatic way despite how much I liked their personalities, they were just unattractive to me - but turns out it was more because of the way they didn't really take care of themselves physically, sometimes had greasy hair, sometimes smelled of sweat... It's really off-putting, regardless of how you look otherwise. On the other hand, when you do have those things pinned down, it makes a *huge* difference. When one of those friends started to take better care of himself, dress better, smell nicer etc., suddenly his attractiveness level increased to a scary degree lol. Don't underestimate it.\n\nEspecially smell. Seriously. I can't stress that enough. Smelling of sweat (or orherwise bad) is so offputting. Smelling nice immediately makes you ten times more attractive.\n\nAlso confidence. Yeah, I know it's easier said than done, but confidence can be worked on and improved. And it's insanely attractive. So many people who if you just saw their picture, you would definitely not describe them as conventionally attractive. But confidence can do wonders.\n\nJust my two cents.

He's one of the people who absolutely *makes* these movies, who makes them what they are...! He's absolutely crucial. He and Miyazaki are a literal dream team, cannot imagine a better duo. I've been to two live concerts of his music (where he conducted the orchestra himself) and just. Uhhh I could gush for ages lol.\n\nHave you seen Ghibli's *The Tale of Princess Kaguya*? That's Isao Takahata's movie, but not only is Hisaishi's music excellent there (no doy), the movie is FCKING BEAUTIFUL man. Like I can't overstate it. It destroys me every time, it's definitely much more somber than Miyazaki's movies, so a fair warning there... but if you haven't seen it, I can't recommend it enough.\n\nAlso, Hisaishi made the music for some of Takeshi Kitano's live action movies as well, if that's something you'd be interested in.

Yeah, that's a good point about Casita.\n\nAnd I do think them being given the magic back was basically a reward/acknowledgement. I still wish it hadn't returned though. I would have adored such an ending.\n\n>Do we know for sure (I forget) that they also got their individual gifts back?\n\nYes, we do. They all use them in the final sequence. The growth is still there though - Isabella makes all these different and \"imperfect\" flowers grow, Luisa can lay down and relax... And one thing I really appreciated is that Mirabel doesn't suddenly get her own magical gift. That would have been really stupid imo and kind of undermined the whole message. She stays \"magic-less\". Her gift was bringing the family back together, helping them all heal, and bringing Casita and their magic back, I suppose. Her real gift is her compassion, courage, perseverance, all that stuff. And the magic was only given back *after* she made peace with herself and fully accepted that it's not the magic that would've made her worthy or important, that defines her - it's All Of Her. They all needed to learn that lesson in order to be able to wield the magic again; it reminds me of what Tony Stark says to Peter Parker in the first(?) MCU Spider-Man movie: \"If you're nothing without the suit, then you shouldn't have it at all.\" He has to learn what it is that really makes one a superhero, what really matters, and only then does he earn his suit back. I think it's like that with the Madrigals.\n\nSo I get it and like I said, it doesn't ruin the ending or anything. It works. But I *still* would have preferred a magic-less ending.

I do think it's more exaggerated from an American's point of view though. We tend to make racist and homophobic jokes quite a bit. Many people separate humour from actual views though. I can make a gay joke that plays into established stereotypes but that doesn't mean I have anything against gay people or would treat them any differently irl. I think you come across that reasoning a lot over here. Of course it's a slippery slope and not all jokes are super okay to make, but generally Czech people tend to see it as \"it's just a joke, I mean no harm,\" I think (also I feel like some people deliberately go harder than they need to because they're sick of everything needing to be pc these days so they're kind of provoking ob purpose..). We're kind of famous for making jokes about everything and everyone, including ourselves. Think of that what you will. But dark or \"politically incorrect\" humour is one of our staples, for better or for worse. We generally mean no harm nor feel any hate or disdain for these minority groups.\n\nThat being said, I do think these issues are definitely present here. I come across tons of casual homophobia. It's not to the point where you would get attacked on the street or anything (at least where I live). I feel like people tend to keep to themselves and talk behind your back lol. But you get comments, jokes, some people use slurs in casual conversations, it's tons of little things. If you bring it up they always say \"I'm not homophobic tho, I have no problem with gay people.\" But they don't stop with those things. They don't see anything wrong with it, they refuse to. And if you have a problem with it, many would just call you too sensitive.\n\nMany Czech people have this attitude of \"do whatever you want, be with whoever you want, I don't give a shit, I don't care what your skin colour is - just don't bother *me* with it.\" Which on one hand is nice, people generally won't go out of their way to hate on you or anything like that; but on another level it's annoying, because a) they think that because of this attitude, they can't possibly be homophobic (or any other -phobic), so they refuse to acknowledge when they do make a mistake or change because they don't see themselves as homophobic - it's kind of like \"I don't care if you're a f*ggt, therefore you can't say I'm homophobic\"... b) sometimes even being public with your orientation/racial issues, things like Pride parades etc., is seen as \"bothering them with it\". And god forbid these groups actually want equal rights, like gay marriage for example. Basically some people just don't want to see it at all.\n\nSo I'd say generally speaking, people here are not overtly hateful or even discriminatory most of the time, no malicious intent. It's all in that casual homophobia/racism/what have you. Which they're often very blind to. Which can also suck but hey, still loads better than some other places...\n\nOf course this is very area- and social bubble-specific. University circles in Prague, for example - very good on that front. I can't speak for the whole country. I don't have that kind of experience.\n\nSorry for such a long rant.

But he was the one she went to first. Unless I'm misremembering... Then she probably concluded it was no use because he didn't really care and he wouldn't help her anyway, he didn't understand her (didn't he again say something like there was nothing she can do to help, it wasn't her problem, so to just forget about it...?).\n\nSo while it was shitty of Retsuko to go behind his back and lie to him about it, I kinda get why she did it.

But she refused to just accept that there was no way for her to help Ton, so she kept trying to find a way... eventually going to Tadano. He was the only one who actually helped her instead of shutting her down. Not saying the others were in the wrong but I do sympathize with Retsuko here, and I quite like that she wasn't a pushover and refused to take no for an answer. And as about her not telling Haida, I think a part of it was her promise to Ton to not tell anyone in the office... the other part was her probably feeling like she and Haida were already drifting apart, feeling that he wasn't really on her side regarding the issue, and (especially later) lack of trust. I'm pretty sure she was also hiding it because, well, meeting up with her ex after work just looked really bad and would defnitely upset Haida. It's shitty that she didn't communicate with him, I'm not excusing that. But then again, that's not just on Retsuko... it's a two-way street.

It seems that a lot of us feel very much the same way about it.\n\nJust briefly - for me, this was definitely the most frustrating season. Some things were really good and other things were just weird, disjointed, seemingly out of character. There were just so many really weird moments and choices overall. The ending was especially disappointing.\n\nBut yeah, I think the main point of contention is generally Haida... he seemed very out of character this season. Or, like he massively regressed. The fraud plotline seemed like a bit much... almost made it feel like character assassination at times tbh. I still don't believe it's in line with what we saw of Haida in the previous seasons. I think the plot beats could have potentially worked, I could see it making sense on paper, but the way it was handled and justified felt kind of.. contrived? It made me feel like different people were writing it or something. Either way, Haida was quite infuriating and, frankly, increasingly difficult to root for. Most of all though, I hate the fact that his arc went nowhere and they didn't even let him redeem himself. He didn't grow.

I also think that he took the responsibility of suddenly being the boss very seriously and he felt like he had to protect everyone from losing their jobs no matter what. Well, especially Retsuko. Given the buildup from the first half of the season, it would make perfect sense that he would feel that way. If you think about it, he started out just trying to help everyone keep their jobs in perfectly normal ways - like sharing his code trick to improve work efficiency, etc. But it wasn't really enough... so he went further, and got kind of wrapped up in it all.\n\nI think a part of it also could have been him just desperately wanting to do *something*, right. To be a little bit more than just an anonymous face in the crowd. Maybe in a way he may have been trying to prove that to himself...? Maybe also, in a roundabout way, to Retsuko...? Like he felt worthless next to Tadano, very intimidated by him, and then, when he finally started going out with Retsuko, he caught her going behind his back to hang out with Tadano instead and then lying about it - I mean no matter how you look at it, it looks really bad... I feel like that was the moment he cracked and really leaned in to the shady business stuff. I definitely felt a lot of anger and possibly resentment from Haida after that happened. Which I totally sympathize with tbh. Who wouldn't be broken by that... it's like all his fears and insecurities of not being enough, being nobody to her, getting proven right. I'm just trying to figure out what was going through his head. I think that a big part of why he did what he did was that it seemed like the only way to protect everyone. And a part of it was also selfish - to be *something*. To finally be seen and acknowledged. Which, I'd say, is pretty human...\n\nI have to say, that's one aspect I think the season tackled pretty well - the ruthless and impersonal, anonymous nature of the uniform corporate Japanese society, and the existential dread of being just another nameless face in the crowd, somebody expendable, wholly unremarkable, worthless. Haida had always somewhat felt like that, feared that - that he was no one, wasn't good enough, could never measure up, had nothing to offer. That he was just average and unremarkable in every single way. Nobody really knew him nor cared to, which especially hurt from the person he cared about the most. So I can kind of understand that downward spiral.. I'm just still kind of trying to integrate what we saw this season and what I knew about him previously. See if there's a way for it to fit lol.

You perfectly expressed my own mixed feelings. \"i genuinely don't know if i loved this season or hated it\" - speaks out of my soul.\n\nLet me ramble now (it's gonna be long, sorry). Spoilers ahead, obviously.\n\nI agree about the plot. It did feel kind of disjointed, almost random at times. It felt tonally inconsistent a lot of the time, too.\n\nThis\n\n>I thought for sure the moral undertone would be that Haida was doing something to out either the CEO or the three greedy board members for illegal activities, and the moral would be Haida asked Retsuko for trust but she couldn't give it to him.\n\nis exactly what I was hoping for too. I kept thinking \"Haida would never go so far, that can't be right, no way he would actually do that...\"\n\nThis\n\n>It seemed out of character to me that Haida would run like a lap dog to the first person to give him praise in the workplace, at least to the extent of committing major fraud. He's not the same Haida from season one\n\nis exactly it for me. He wasn't the same Haida we'd come to know in the past 3 seasons. Didn't feel like him at all. It was... just strange. Strange all around.\n\nI mean even the self-confidence thing - Haida had always been insecure, we knew that, but it felt like they cranked it up to 11 in s4. Like even though he was anxious and insecure, he's still confessed his love to Retsuko before, with words and all. But suddenly he thinks so badly of himself that he can't even say \"yes\" when *Retsuko* basically asks *him* out? He was completely tragic.. it was honestly hard to watch. After a while I found myself actually wanting Retsuko to just cut the crap for him and straight up dump him. Sorry Haida, I feel for you, I kinda love you, but man... you need to get your sh#t together.\n\nI think the worst part for me is that it felt like they took all the development he went through in the last season - and completely threw it out the window. The way Haida's arc ended in s3 felt meaningful, like a step in the right direction. He finally learned to be a bit more open about his feelings, to finally step up and take initiative. To be a little bit braver. But suddenly we're back to square one. No - not just square one, we're at like minus five it seems. Haida was always insecure but he didn't seem to loathe himself. He had some self-respect. He still had *some* confidence... didn't he? Like jeez, he was even pretty cool at some point...! What the hell happened...? It's like they sucked all of that out of him.\n\nAnd what really pissed me off was how they \"resolved\" it. Like okay, I guess I could accept this - Retsuko already rejected him before so that put yet another significant dent in his confidence... She was an idol, had fans and followers, she had all these adventures and cool people around her, heck she even dated this insanely cool genius billionaire for a while - and *she* dumped *him*! How could Haida ever possibly measure up...? Now that Retsuko finally seems somewhat within reach, he freaks out and all his insecurity - that had perhaps been there all along, just didn't seem *as* massive before - comes rushing to the surface. He feels like he's not good enough for her, and either way it will eventually implode, so he's too afraid to even try. Listen, I can be sympathetic to that. It makes Haida's entire presence in s3 feel kind of meaningless but whatever, I could get over it, I could probably find some reasoning to kind of justify or explain it. But I hate that they didn't even let him grow this season - like at all!! If anything, he regressed...\n\nThink about it - he spends the first third (or so) of the season wussing out and being too scared to ask Retsuko out or do anything really. And does he eventually overcome this hurdle? No, in the end it has to be Retsuko - she is the one who has to tell him she's interested. And later he goes on to do all that morally dubious stuff, get manipulated by his boss and commit fraud... basically becoming the season's antagonist (damn, how did we get there)... and does the show let him redeem himself? Hell no! It has to be Retsuko to set him straight, yet again! And even in the final showdown, when he actually stands up to the president - and then Retsuko, *again*, randomly shows up and screams them both out the window??? Like seriously, what *was* that ending...?? *At least* give him a proper redemption... Like it's ultimately okay if a character makes a series of really bad choices, that makes them human I guess, but if you want to portray that he's still really a good guy and present him as redeemed - then actually let him redeem himself, dammit...!!\n\nWell sh#t. That was a tangent haha. Sorry.\n\nIf anyone has any counterpoints, a way to frame it differently to make it less frustrating, I welcome them with open arms. I really want to like it. I mean despite this rant, there was some really good stuff this season as well. Like I said, still not sure whether I hated or loved it. But the Haida arc just... yeah.\n\n(Oh, also that one scene where Fenneko randomly just throws Haida under the bus??? She spent allll that time and energy playing matchmaker, had always been there for Haida as support, and then when he gets promoted, she not only tells everyone his \"secret\" to make him look kind of bad, but she also takes a rather suggestive picture of him and Tsunoda - and *immediately* sends it to Retsuko?? Just when they had *finally* started going out? Why???? And it's literally never addressed again?? *????????*)", "created_utc": "1639680841.0", "edited": "1639681121.0", "id": "hotbrs0", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_rhp4ue", "parent_id": "t1_hort02q", "score": "33", "subreddit": "aggretsuko", "subreddit_id": "t5_fi0gt"}, {"author": "ElsaKit", "body": "I'm like... super conflicted rn.

More specifically, HE failed. Now he's alone and has close to nothing left; he's full of grief and guilt, shaken to his very core because he never had to deal with a failure of this magnitude. He is devastated, beats himself up to no end, and he's lost his faith in himself. His way to cope feels very in-character to me - he just lets himself go. He blocks it out, represses the hell out of it...

Not sure how popular or unpopular this is as an opinion, but seeing that it has 8.0 on IMDB, I feel like it belongs here.\n\nLet me explain. \n\nVisually, it was beautiful. Great fight scenes, wonderful spectacle; I even liked the character introductions and Katie specifically (I know some people found her annoying, but I actually enjoyed her). However, I don't think the movie was much more than just that - a spectacle. After the introduction that kind of got my hopes up, the characters were just bland and completely dull. Very uninteresting overall. Especially Shang-Chi (and his sister as well...). He had close to no personallity, he just felt like a plot vessel. Just your generic protagonist with a tragic backstory who is presented as kind-of-but-not-realy a loser while secretly being cool. Katie at least had a distinct personality, she was the best character for me, the only one I got invested in. There was no character growth anywhere to be seen; they tried to tackle the issues of heritage and trauma, the impacts of having an abusive parent, making peace with where you come from, accepting that both the good and the bad are parts of you and shape you as a person - which are all such great concepts, but in the end it fell completely flat. It was very surface-level and the movie didn't actually delve into these questions at all. It was all solved by Shang-Chi learning to airbend, and that was that.\n\nAlmost worst of all, the movie was completely predictable. Like okay, superhero movies kind of get to be a bit predictable, I get that - but there was literally nothing surprising there, nothing new or unexpexted, nothing that caught me off guard or subverted my expectations in any way, no plot twist whatsoever. You knew exactly what was going to happen at any point pretty much from the exposition dump at the beginning (Edit: Well, the Mandarin did catch me off guard, I have to give them that...). It's just a shame.\n\nI actually had fun watching it on the big screen. I enjoyed the ride. But if I think about the movie even a little critically, it just wasn't very good imo. Take away the impresive visuals and it would be the most boring movie ever, no substance, nothing to make it worth watching. I guess the villain was decent, at least his motivations were human and understandable, but even then, there were better villains within the MCU, he didn't stand out at all and won't be particularly memorable imo. It's a shame. I hope Shang-Chi's next appearance in the MCU is stronger character-wise. He needs a solid, memorable personality if he is to stick and actually work with the rest; otherwise he will get completely overshadowed and buried.\n\nPlease feel free to disagree and lmk what you thought about the movie.

It would culminate with >! the (supposed) killing of him and his daughter.!< Not only would that make the movie we actually got make more sense and hit that much harder, it would also do SO MUCH for Black Widow as a character. She had been essentially a secondary character all this time and it's such a shame because she's frcking great. Giving her a solo movie only *after* her death is way too late...\n\nAlso, this is kind of unrelated to the point, but the ending somewhat frustrates me (obv. spoilers ahead). The movie had such incredible potential to tackle the issues of guilt and retribution, forgiveness and self-forgiveness... and Taskmaster - you know, the little girl whom Natasha mutilated and whose life she ruined, basically sacrificing her, arguably the darkest thing she ever did - should have been the main vehicle for such a conversation. She should have had a much bigger role and forced Natasha to properly confront the horrible things she did in her past and *actually do something to atone for them.* But that conversation never happened. Nat never actually had to do anything, and she didn't actually face any real consequences. Instead, they just punched each other for a bit and then Nat smashed some red gass in her face and suddenly all was solved and forgiven. Taskmaster didn't even really have any spoken lines, for god's sake. It started out so good, Nat grapling with her past and posing the question whether one can truly be forgiven and forgive oneself, whether her bloodied file can actually ever be wiped clean - but the movie never went anywhere with it. It's just a waste of potential (and character).\n\nI feel the need to say that I did actually really love the movie. I thought it was great, above all the chamistry between characters and the way they played off of each other were brilliant imo. It was a lot of fun while also having a lot of heart.

I was also picturing the movie characters, especially at first, but I guess the book felt like so much of its own thing that I gradually somewhat disconmected from the movie, in a sense. I mean, the way Howl looks in the movie is completely spot on (down to his eye colour and earrings iirc), so I still imagined him pretty much the same way. But some of the other things and characters, not so much. Most of all though, I felt like even the plot was so different that I didn't actually know what to expect, so I thoroughly enjoyed the whole ride. I mean, the movie completely revolves around the war and Howl changing into some kind of monster and having to be saved from himself... but none of that is even present in the book! War is pretty much just very vaguely in the background, but its role is nowhere near as significant as in the movie. The book revolves much more around the Witch of the Waste (who is also NOTHING like in the movie), and the whole climax is completely different as well.\n\nI was also counting on the book to explain some strange and vague points from the movie that we seemed to lack proper context for, like the scarecrow/prince, the weird dog, the random, brief and out-of-the-blue appearance of Sophie's \"mother\" (who looked younger than Sophie herself)... And I just absolutely loved to see where all these things came from in the original story, what the context was, where Miyazaki took it from, to see the explanations. I had so many moments while reading the book when I was like \"Oooooh! So *that's* what this was!\" Not to mention just having more context for the events and characters in general, their backgrounds, some motivations better explained, expanded on or slightly changed, etc...\n\nYeah, idk, the book just did it for me!\n\nThat's not to say that I suddenly dislike the movie or anything...!

And you're essentially forced to keep it in, leave it festering, like you said, which is just bound to blow up somewhere.\n\nI also want to say, \"pedophile\" *doesn't equal* \"child molester\" or \"r*pist.\" Yet people keep using these interchangeably, which just adds to this - it makes the \"crime\" of having certain urges which are out of your conscious control equal to the crime of actually hurting and exploiting children... which just adds to the demonization and takes away people's chance to get help and support in time (or if not 'takes away' entirely, then at least makes it significantly more difficult). It only helps to make them feel like they're inherently some monsters that don't ever have a chance to be seen as anything else. But these things are absolutely NOT the same, and whatever you may feel about it, a pedophile who never hurts, never touches a child in their life, is not a monster... and they deserve compassion and help just like anyone else.\n\nThis is definitely a very touchy subject and there's no easy answer. The question of rehabilitation is very tricky as well... I think protecting potential victims should be the priority - which would also (and ideally) be done by prevention, like you said. We're focusing so much on catching offenders who have actually hurt someone, and understandably so, but maybe we should invest more energy and effort into making help for pedophiles accessible so that these thing happen as little as possible..\n\nI hope that made sense.", "created_utc": "1628758118.0", "edited": "False", "id": "h8msw7x", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_p2ljhn", "parent_id": "t3_p2ljhn", "score": "5", "subreddit": "mentalillness", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qwyh"}, {"author": "ElsaKit", "body": "Excuse me what?!", "created_utc": "1628722864.0", "edited": "False", "id": "h8lebv6", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_p2f39x", "parent_id": "t1_h8kyj8d", "score": "15", "subreddit": "CatsAreAssholes", "subreddit_id": "t5_2zexl"}, {"author": "ElsaKit", "body": "Beautifully put.

It\u2019s like a massive eye spy book. People are always amazed when I just casually pick a 4 leafed clover up and hand it to them.\n\nOmg same! Hahaha. I do the exact same things. I rarely specifically go to look for them, I usually find them while walking somewhere (like maybe I slpw down or even pause in front of a clover patch and look for a sec if it's a nice one..). Often I see a patch and I just know that a four-leaf's gotta be there.\n\nOne of my funniest catches was when we were playing some sort of a racing game outside, probably during PE; it was my turn, I was running as fast as I could and then, right at the finished line, I tripped and fell; and to everyone's disbelief, I just went \"Oh look, a four-leaf clover!\" Right in front of my face as I fell hahaha.\n\nIt's funny though, I don't love 5 and 6-leaved clovers. I thought it was super cool when I would find them as a kid, but now idk, they are a bit disappointing...? It's hard to explain. I'd much rather find a four-leaf clover, they just look so much neater and more aesthetically pleasing... And 4-leaves bring good luck, but what do these do? Nothing. (lmao) I know this probably doesn't make any sense, but to me 5 and 6-leaved ones often kinda feel like \"cheating\"...? Like usually I don't just find one, usually there's more of them in the same patch. Which means that the patch is somehow \"mutated\" or whatever and the find doesn't feel nearly as satisfying. Idk man, I seriously don't know how to explain my dissatisfaction with them lol. But yeah, I usually don't pick them, I leave them there. Same with when I find a patch full of 4+-leaved clovers. It doesn't feel like anything special anymore if there's a ton of them in one place, so I tend to leave them alone. It's so much more satisfying to find a single four-leaf clover in a patch of normal ones!\n\n(Forgive my crazy rambling lol.

You can say \"u\u017e jsme tady\" = we're here (already) (usually implying something like \"we've arrived\"), or \"u\u017e jsme zase tady\" = we're back (here) again; you can also say \"jsme zase **tam**, kde jsme byli\" (be careful about the different use of tam (= there) x tady (= here)) = we're back to where we started. You can even say the last one as \"**u\u017e** jsme zase tam, kde jsme byli\" - the meaning is the same, the \"u\u017e\" only provides more emphasis (if I wanted to reflect that explicitly in the translation, I would probably put it as \"we're back to where we started *again*\" or sth like that). Be careful - in this sentence you can leave out the \"u\u017e,\" but you can't really leave out the \"zase\"!

Example: \"Ten klobouk je *\u010derven\u00fd*\" (= That hat is *red*). \"(Ten klobouk je) *jak\u00fd?*\" - \"\u010cerven\u00fd.\" Ergo, \"\u010derven\u00fd\" is an adjective. Or you can think of it this way - you can substitute the adjective with the word \"jak\u00fd\" and make the sentence into a question - \"Ten klobouk je *jak\u00fd?*\" (lit. \"What is the hat like?\", it can refer to colour, size, or any other property of the hat). The same goes with adverbs and \"jak\" (e.g. \"Vypad\u00e1 *divn\u011b* (= He/she looks *weird*).\" - \"(Vypad\u00e1) *jak?*\" - \"Divn\u011b.\"). This is on the most basic level, there are other words you \"ask\" about adjectives/adverbs with, but let's not make it even more complicated. Now, all this may sound a bit confusing to a non-native speaker because it probably doesn't actually help you distinguish between the two word classes, but this is how Czech people learn it. I just wanted to give some insight into how the words behave in connection to adjectives and adverbs. I hope I didn't make it sound too complicated...]\n\nNow, where it becomes tricky is the translation. In English, you have \"how\", which in isolation and in some cases would indeed be translated as \"jak\" - e.g. \"*How* are you?\" = \"*Jak* se m\u00e1\u0161?\" HOWEVER, you can't think of these words as equivalent; \"how\" doesn't equal \"jak\", just like \"what\" doesn't equal \"jak\u00fd\". The English interrogative words (such as \"what\", \"how\") are much more vague and can be used in many different contexts where Czech would have entirely different words.\n\nIf you want to translate the word \"jak\u00fd\" as literally as possible, it would be closest to \"*like* what\", as in \"*what* is something *like*.\" My example sentence from above, \"jak\u00fd je ten klobouk,\" would most closely mean \"what is the hat like,\" \"what does the hat look like.\" Of course, in most cases you won't actually phrase it like that in English. \"Jakou to m\u00e1 barvu\" (\"jakou\" = feminine accusative form of \"jak\u00fd\") would be \"*what colour* is it,\" \"jak\u00e1 byla cesta\" (lit. \"what was the trip like\") would be \"how was the trip,\" etc. To that question of yours, you can't ask \"*jak* byla cesta,\" because you're asking about an adjective - the trip was exciting / long / boring / annoying / etc. - not an adverb. You can use \"jak\" in phrases like \"*Jak dlouh\u00e1* bude cesta?\" = \"*How long* will the trip be/take?\" That's different, because it's not just \"jak\" alone, it's the phrase \"jak dlouh\u00fd\" = \"how long\". Same with \"jak \u010dasto\" = \"how often\", \"jak rychle\" = \"how fast,\" etc. In all these cases, you're essentially modifying an adjective (e.g. long) or an adverb (e.g. often) with another adverb - the answer to \"how long\" could be \"very (=adv) long\"; ergo, the rule that \"jak\" stands in for an adverb and \"jak\u00fd\" for an adjective still stands.\n\nThe problem is, the adj/adv distinction is not always clear in English, you have many words that can be both (e.g. long, late), and then there are these colloquialized phrases like \"How are you?\" - \"I'm *good*\" instead of \"I'm *well*,\" etc. ... so it gets... confusing.\n\nWell this was super long, I genuinly hope I didn't confuse you even more.. I tried to explain it the best I could, but in case it's too confusing, I'm happy to try and clarify. Or maybe someone can explain it in a less wordy way...", "created_utc": "1622740850.0", "edited": "1623349141.0", "id": "h0gnv2k", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_nqiakf", "parent_id": "t1_h0fjnok", "score": "3", "subreddit": "learnczech", "subreddit_id": "t5_32zci"}, {"author": "ElsaKit", "body": "Thanks!!", "created_utc": "1622736656.0", "edited": "False", "id": "h0gdtay", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_nqiakf", "parent_id": "t1_h0fgcax", "score": "1", "subreddit": "learnczech", "subreddit_id": "t5_32zci"}, {"author": "ElsaKit", "body": "That's interesting.
