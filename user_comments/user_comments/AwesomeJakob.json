I'm 21, and quite happy with my improvement (no plateaus so far).\n\nAssuming I'm around 2050 ELO (I've not played much OTB, but I haven't struggled nearly as much with the transition as some other people in this thread), and I want to reach a level where I can compete in blitz with other titled players like FMs and occasionally upset a player like yourself (i.e. reach 2300 strength), what % of the way from 0/600 - 2300 am I currently at?  50%? 75%? 10%? \n\nI'd also like to become a FM eventually in my life, and I wonder how realistic that is if I actively pursue chess along a normal study & work life.\n\nLastly, if you have the time, perhaps you could try to explain the strength or difficulty of certain ratings like 1000-1800 took me as long as 2300-2400 or something like that.

Maybe because the key locations are distinctly different from Qwerty, although Colemak is supposed to be easier to learn precisely BECAUSE it is so similar to  Qwerty?\n\nFeel free to join the Colemak and Dvorak discord servers btw, there's lots of helping and nice nerds on there :) The best Colemak typist is Viper, and the best Dvorak typist is John!.\n\nBy the way, I don't really like the term 'multilingual' when it comes to layouts, there should be a distinction to actual languages like German, Spanish, English... Which can all be typed with alternate forms of these three layouts I believe.\n\nI kinda coined the term 'layoutfluid' for people like me and future you.

A senior adult in one group loses a bunch of games, then just ragequits and leaves the tournament hall. He is subsequently banned from further tournaments.\nI believe this might have happened twice, but the second time the only real adult in our group quit after losing all of the games he had to play (including blundering a mate in one against me) so that didn't affect the other players.\n\nMy chess club organizes a pretty big tournament in my town, in my school, even. The tourney is running pretty smoothly I'd say, except there's like that one kid who has used a needle or something and stabbed other players with it during the breaks. He has to publicly apologize to the victims and shake their hands in front of everyone attending the tournament. Pretty awkward intervention, overall.\n\nBy far the most embarrassing event happened in a rapid tournament though where we were playing in set teams. I face an older lady and just blunder a piece within four moves. 1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6 4. O-O axb5.\nNow, me blundering a piece like a complete beginner isn't even the embarrassing part here, nor is it the fact that she *is* one and 1000+ points weaker than me, no, it's the fact that I try to take the move back, as in, I (try to) move my king and room back and move my bishop instead.\nI could give a few excuses now, I could say that I had an off day, I was exhausted from the other games, distracted, or irritated because she was writing down the moves, something that you don't usually do in rapid tournaments and a big reason why I attempted my sneaky crime in the first place since she was not paying much attention to the board, but in any case, I still did it and she noticed.\nTo my luck though she doesn't make a big deal out of it and I manage to destroy her within some moves, and out of guilt offer her a draw one move before checkmate. She is very surprised and happily and gratefully accepts. I go wash my face because oh my god what am I dirty scumbag doing.\n\nI still cringe when thinking about the act, taking back a move usually never even occurs to me and I don't ask for takebacks on lichess... so this was quite a unique experience, and I hope it stays that way.\n I have to admit that I may not have offered a draw if our team hadn't wiped out their team of seniors and there was no chance of losing the match, or if it had been rated.
