And in news or social media, it can make you feel seen and less alone. \n\nIt is problematic when it's haphazardly used as a gimmick for financial gain or for taking the moral high-ground, but that's a problem with people's motives and many not knowing how to incorporate it, not representation itself. \n\nI'm not saying representation should be a focus for every piece of media, but it's something worth considering that can improve stories and (like in OP's post) simply make people happy to \"be included\" for a moment.

The only positive feeling from it I've ever gotten has been just a hesitant respect/fascination towards the thing because they don't fully understand it.\n\nI read through some [example sentences from old literature](https://dictionary.goo.ne.jp/jn/53909/example/m0u/) and some [example English translations](https://ejje.weblio.jp/sentence/content/%E5%A5%87%E5%A6%99) and they all seem along the lines of \"weird\" or \"curious\".\n\nAs another example, on [this](https://career-picks.com/business-yougo/weird/2/) page explaining the English word \"weird\", it says:\u300cweird\u300d\u306b\u306f\u3001 \u300c\u5909\u306a\u3001\u5947\u5999\u306a\u3001\u5909\u308f\u3063\u3066\u3044\u308b\u300d\u3068\u3044\u3046\u610f\u5473\u304c\u3042\u308a\u307e\u3059\u3002\u300c\u5947\u5999\u306a\u300d\u3068\u3044\u3046\u610f\u5473\u306e\u82f1\u8a9e\u306f\u3001\u4ed6\u306b\u3082\u300cstrange\u300d\u300codd\u300d\u306a\u3069\u304c\u3042\u308a\u307e\u3059\u3002\n\nI only referenced \u98a8\u5909\u308f\u308a because I didn't think the other definitions fully supported either interpretation, which did end up being misleading, my mistake. \n\n\u73cd\u3057\u3044 is a mostly neutral meaning of \"rare\", and \u4e0d\u601d\u8b70 is something you can't quite understand (so yes, unimaginable), with a slight feeling of mystery. I wouldn't call either of those \"wonderful\" because they don't have a distinct positive feeling attached to them like \"wonderful\" does. \u975e\u5e38\u306b\u8da3\u30fb\u304a\u3082\u3057\u308d\u307f\u30fb\u3046\u307e\u307f\u306a\u3069\u304c\u3042\u308b\u3053\u3068 is definitely the most positive, so I should have mentioned it, but it just didn't feel the same as what you were describing. It sounds more like \"hey this is surprisingly good\" rather than an unimaginable wondrous feeling. Plus I've only seen it used that way once or twice.\n\nI think it *can* have a feeling of \"wow this is amazing and wonderful and awesome\", but really that seems to be more reliant on context, and isn't really said by the word itself.

If someone wrote \u7259 and put \u306f (ha) next to it, then they're probably saying \"tooth\" (\u6b6f), but implicitly mean \"fang\" (\u7259).\n\nTranslators often decide to put quotation marks in cases like these, where the word is meant to be different from the rest somehow, but as you've noticed it doesn't give the same feeling as the original text.\n\nYou could try translating it *back* into Japanese - \"The elves use Hagane-no-Ken\", or maybe just capitalization - \"The elves use Steel Blades\", or maybe add a translation note or something, but really there's no perfect way. \n\nQuotation marks is one of the easier tactics, so many translators will just default to using them any time there's \"special\" words.", "created_utc": "1552487254.0", "edited": "False", "id": "eifjia9", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_b0kq2b", "parent_id": "t1_eifasra", "score": "10", "subreddit": "manga", "subreddit_id": "t5_2ql0i"}, {"author": "Rpg_gamer_", "body": "Mine is Favorite Things linkffn(11318985).

In that case I'd like to add that if you're going to have any major antagonists or drama-creators you might want to include them in your \"deep\" characters, as that can make the conflict more interesting.\n\nI like the \"why throw four people at a problem when you can send forty\" :) I'm guessing you see specialists as like a separate section of the military, where everyone is essentially in the same standing? I've always sorta pictured them that way too, but I still kinda wonder what being a \"specialist\" would actually entail compared to just standard military personnel. \n\nIn armies there's often people who specialize in certain fields like defusing bombs, driving, medical support, etc., but I don't think they're treated with a special label of \"specialists\" or anything. I mean with just a general label of \"specialist\" you're left thinking \"specialist of what?\". At least with \"air force\" and \"marines\" etc. you know what they specialize in. \n\nI think maybe the general military is in charge of rather distinct and consistent duties like guarding areas/people/events, clearing grimm, and open combat when there's war, while the specialists are left to deal with unexpected occasions or missions that require being discreet and efficient. \n\nThey could be the only place with people who have special skill sets, but I feel like that would require quite a few people to be specialists... I guess there's not that many wars and stuff in Remnant anyway so maybe they wouldn't need that many?\n\nThere's also the possibility that they play a commanding role over much of the standard military. They could send even more than forty people to deal with problems that way :)\n\nI think having a person around just for their tactical skill can be interesting and does sorta make sense, but it does have its problems. Unless they're just an advisor outside of battle then they'd need to be *somewhat* competent in battle in order to not drag the team down. If you really want them to suck at fighting, maybe make them mobile enough to survey a situation and stay out of trouble. Being an actual burden does open up possibilities for conflict and making things more interesting/difficult, but having a blatant weak link like that can be annoying for the reader sometimes. \n\nThere's also the whole \"oh this guy is smart so I'm gonna make him figure out everything for everyone and all problems will be solved by him, because nobody in the team is capable of thinking on his level\" problem. Some writers overplay the whole super-smart tactician idea and forget that having multiple eyes and perspectives on a situation is an invaluable resource of information. Having other people weigh in with ideas and things they notice makes the rest of the team seem less like idiots, makes them feel more like a team of equals, and is (in my opinion) what a good tactician would try to aim for.\n\nTbh I never even thought of Winter getting over her prejudices.

Changing a verb's -u ending into -i is a somewhat old piece of grammar, which roughly changes the verb into the **state of** doing that action. It's not really used much anymore, but there's still bits of it left over with stuff like \u597d\u304d.\n\nI *think* it's kinda different from stuff like \u304a\u5e30\u308a in polite language, as \"\u304a\u5e30\u308a\u306a...\" seems wrong to me... but I'm not sure to be honest.\n\nAnyway, the gist is that \u597d\u304d is an adjective *describing* the state of liking something, and because it's formed without \u3044, it's a na-adjective, meaning it can often act on it's own without conjugation. \n\nWhen you say \u72ac\u304c\u597d\u304d, you're not saying that dogs *do* anything, you're stating a trait about dogs, the trait that they're something you like. And... well this is where the \"subject\" interpretation of \u304c falls flat. \"Subjects\" in European languages are the thing doing an action. But following a noun with \u304c does not mean it has to be followed with a verb. It's just saying \"about me - dogs are (in the state of me liking them)\". \n\nYou could try and twist it into \"since \u597d\u304d came from a verb it sorta still acts like one\", but then look at the sentence \u79c1\u304c\u72ac\u304c\u6016\u3044 - I'm afraid of dogs. The second \u304c states something about dogs, and the first \u304c shows that that statement about dogs relates back to \u79c1. It's the same with \u597d\u304d and \u6016\u3044 because they're both adjectives.\n\nAnd now you may be thinking \"but, if generalized information can follow \u304c and it doesn't show the grammatical subject, isn't it the same as \u306f?\". In response to that, I'd bring you back to what I said in my initial comment, with \"\u79c1 just does stuff/**expresses itself** with \u304c\". The stuff marked with \u304c does stuff within a sentence without necessarily being the topic, and sometimes the stuff it does is just **be** things. \n\nNo idea if this will help, but in Korean, adjectives are just \"descriptive verbs\", like \"this food **is being** delicious\". Japanese doesn't really have anything like that, but I think maybe that idea could help in understanding that you don't always need a verb for there to be action. Like, \u79c1\u306f\u72ac\u304c\u6016\u3044 is a full sentence, and despite it a verb being a \"requirement\" of a full sentence, there's no word in there that you could really call a \"verb\".

The \u3088\u306d is added because it's weird to just say \"**you know this**\" and leave it at that. It's so weird that without \u3088\u306d the subject becomes unclear, and the other person might wonder who \u77e5\u3063\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059 applies to. Many Japanese people would prefer this ambiguity over using \u3042\u306a\u305f though.\n\nThe second one is actually fine because it's describing a situation from an outside perspective, and the people doing each action need to be established. **After** this sentence, if you started describing her eating, you could start the sentence with \"\u30e9\u30fc\u30e1\u30f3\u3092\u98df\u3079\u306a\u304c\u3089...\" (while eating ramen...) without the \"\u5f7c\u5973\", because we know who's eating already.\n\nThe sentences aren't wrong by any means, but they want to make sure Japanese learners understand the grammar being used in the English, so they can't leave such details out. \n\n... But your problem with the sentences probably wasn't that. If there's anything confusing about them I could try to explain it to you...", "created_utc": "1545082748.0", "edited": "1545083583.0", "id": "ec05ock", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_a6velu", "parent_id": "t1_ebzoe08", "score": "2", "subreddit": "duolingo", "subreddit_id": "t5_2t6ze"}, {"author": "Rpg_gamer_", "body": "I sort of just play what I want to play and prioritize stuff that has stuff to read.\n\nLike, I found Dragon Age Origins in French great since it's dubbed and has tons of reading to do, but plenty of other games can fulfill the same role really.

One needs to sympathize with both sides to consider what actions are justified and what is actually happening/will happen.\n\n>I'm saying just give them a break\n\nI'm more against their actions because they're plain harmful, rather than because it's not understandable or worthy of sympathy. They do deserve sympathy, but I just feel that not considering the life of the person who cheated is more an action of spite and anger than logic.

Try to avoid using them other than to force the enemy back or mix things up.\n\nAlso once your opponent is near the net forcing you back, you might want to try to get them to move back with wide shots, back lobs, or quick curves. Wide shots are the least likely to work at pushing them back, but also pretty much the only one you can actually score with out of the 3.\n\nBe just a millisecond more patient and calm with your plays. I see you deciding which way to go before the opponent actually throws, and then you have to backtrack to compensate.\n\nMe and /u/ImScaryBro both said you should quick curve less. You should also learn to replace those quick curves with skill curves. Try to get the hang of making slight skill curves that make your disc go to a vulnerable area for the opponent. I've found this much easier to do on Stanton but that's just my personal preference. \n\nLike /u/RyPhi said, try to get supers more. But I'd argue that even blue is enough to consistently get supers out of if you're facing a Makenna, who's blues are actually pretty slow.\n\nWhich brings me to the last thing, and the thing that's closest to \"suck less\". Learning to know the path the disc is going is very important. If you know where the disc is going earlier, you can set up for a super earlier. You can catch it *before* it bounces off the wall, and then throw a corner shot from the net. You can catch that shot that otherwise would have cost you the game.\n\nWhen it comes to *how* to read the path of the shots, keep in mind that on a small court like this and only so many directions you can shoot, there's only so many possible paths your opponent can throw. One example of this is the hard skill curve serve shot Makennas often do (and you failed to catch multiple times). It curves hard into the wall, a bit on your side of the net, and then diagonally travels to the opposite corner. This becomes pretty easy to catch once you start to notice the pattern. Though moving into position beforehand can screw you over if you were wrong, so sometimes it's best as just a thing to make you more prepared.\n\nSorry for the wall of text.", "created_utc": "1490868386.0", "edited": "False", "id": "dfljsp0", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_62c6tc", "parent_id": "t3_62c6tc", "score": "9", "subreddit": "DiscJam", "subreddit_id": "t5_3cigp"}, {"author": "Rpg_gamer_", "body": "Define \"good\"...

I recommend placing both yourself and your turrets in places that people wouldn't often pan their cameras towards, or in places where they'll already be dealing with your teammates attacking them as well. I see many people following the first part, but even if turrets are hidden well, they're pretty useless if you don't lay them so your teammates can kill the enemies you weaken with them. A hidden turret can often be found and destroyed, but a turret that was behind them while trying to avoid a D.VA is often left unnoticed for much longer.\n\nHer primary fire can be quite powerful if you can start attacking them without them noticing for a couple of seconds, or if you can somehow avoid their fire long enough. Hiding in a corner and pouncing on someone when they walk into an area where you have turrets set up is a common tactic.\n\nDon't forget her secondary fire can go through shields like Reinhardt's. \n\nTry to use a mix of half charged and fully charged secondary fire to punish enemies that walk through a choke point. They'll be forced to avoid it and make their movement more predictable or get hit.\n\nHer teleporter has an arrow showing what direction your teammates will face when they go through it. The ideal teleporter is somewhere the enemy team wouldn't expect/would have a hard time getting to, is moderately close (but not too close or it'll be found) to where they need to be, and is placed at a time that makes the best use of its 6 charges (rather than at a time where your teammates will just trickle through and get mowed down by a prepared team).\n\nOne more thing to remember is that unlike other characters, she can jump around, crouch, etc without having any effect on the damage of her primary fire, but it will certainly have an effect of the person trying to kill you. So erratic movement is more recommended on this character (when the enemy sees you that is).\n\nOverall though, she's not the greatest of characters right now and that's why she's getting so many buffs.\n\nedit: oh, and one more thing. Given that the turrets make a noise and display an exclamation mark whenever they detect someone, a single turret can be used to know when somebody's trying to flank. This is most useful when you have a mic and can alert your teammates of it. Given that you actually have to be facing the turret's direction to notice though, it's not always a useful tactic.", "created_utc": "1479956963.0", "edited": "1479957809.0", "id": "dadcie0", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_5ef0gi", "parent_id": "t1_dacuytg", "score": "5", "subreddit": "OWConsole", "subreddit_id": "t5_3f3wt"}, {"author": "Rpg_gamer_", "body": "Hey this is a month old post but I enjoyed the video and it helped me out a ton.

By learning to write a kanji, you'll have a seperate kind of sensory experience related to it, and as such, have a stronger connection to it, memory-wise. When you're trying to remember which out of \u7a4f and \u96a0 a word ended with, or what the hell \u5614\u5410 means, a slightly stronger connection in your memory can make the difference.\n\nBut so can just having more experience with the kanji.

I've never tried it.\n\nBut in the end, I'd never call it a waste of time. If it makes even a slight amount of difference, then the only way to read the same way a native does is to learn to write. \n\nYou'll want to focus mostly on practicing writing them, rather than just looking up their stroke order, because the sensory experience of writing them down is the key that makes it worth it.\n\nIt's up to you, really. Just be aware that it might slow you down a bit. Or it might make learning faster, if it helps cement the kanji in your brain faster.

It doesn't teach you that you'd pronounce that as \"ikimono\", and as far as I know, it doesn't teach vocabulary in general.\n\nSo the game plan for people using heisig would be to use the heisig book to learn the meanings of the kanji, and use other resources like anki on top of it to learn the other stuff that accompanies it such as pronunciation.\n\nWanikani is quite a different service. It teaches you radicals and kanji meanings just like Heisig, but that's where the similarities end. Once it teaches a kanji, it follows up soon after with a vocab word that includes the kanji. It include the \"most common\" pronunciations of each kanj (kanji have multiple pronunciations quite often) and vocabulary that it introduces. It also includes a srs in-built, and a somewhat pre-set schedule you have to follow (this can be troublesome for people who aren't complete beginners, since it delays them actually learning).\n\nAs for the detriments to wani-kani, it focuses on mnemonics that just get more and more ridiculous as you go on, to the point that they become near useless by the time you've learned you first 1000 or so kanji. It almost requires modifications to your browser that are made by the community and posted in the forums to be able to do stuff that's near essential to making it efficient. It forces you to go slower than many people would like at first, but actually gets a bit too much later on. It has a monthy fee. And there's probably other stuff.\n\nBut... it has the pronunciations, and if I remember correctly, it even includes automatic audio of native speakers saying everything that comes up on the srs. But I may be wrong. So, even if it has a bunch of problems, and even if I dropped it at level 32 out of 50(?), I still see it as a better resource than heisig, and I see it as a valuable stepping stone in the path I took to where I am now.\n\nOh and btw, the whole putting you on equal grounds as Chinese people thing, Wanikani does that too but, like I said, it's dumbed down (a bit too much).\n\nEdit: this is quite biased towards wanikani, since I never gave heisig a proper chance, such as not looking for stuff to accompany it like you're supposed to.\n\nEdit2: oh, a detriment with Wanikani that I still suffer (only slightly) from 2 years after quitting, I have a bit of trouble knowing what parts the kanji I'm looking at is actually made of when trying to find it in an online ditcionary.

I'll list the differences I noticed.\n\n- The approaches on the enemy were less consistent, which made surprise attacks easier, but general control harder.\n\n- Along the same lines, if you went slightly in the wrong direction with destroyer, you can put yourself in a very bad situation, because your main method of propulsion doesn't have a quick enough fire rate to recover yourself from the bad situation. Tria-angle doesn't have this problem.\n\n- Tri-angle has the small benefit that you aim forward to charge towards the enemy, which means your rather weak bullets can wear down your enemy during the chase, and given that nobody can out-run you, this is actually a way I've killed many people that I had trouble closing in on, but wasn't dying from being close to them.\n\n- I was able to kill the triple-shot (not triplet) with relative ease, while it was much more difficult with triangle, strangely.\n\n- Destroyer has a better chance against the classes body damage is bad against, such as gunners. This is because it can overcome its difficulty in closing in with a sudden, single-use burst in speed from its recoil. Chasing after the classes you're bad against is a bad idea with both, but destroyer wins when it comes to that initial engagement. This opens up more options as to what it can kill, and it won't run out of prey as easily, because it won't be entirely limited to not killing the classes it's bad against.\n\n- I found myself only hitting the enemy once when I managed to close the distance and having to close the distance again with another shot to do more damage sometimes when using destroyer. This doesn't happen often at all with triangle. Your control and speed with triangle is much more consistent, so once you're in distance, you'll just be repeatedly hitting the enemy until they die. This was especially evident in the way I died: I buried myself into the shots of an octo-tank, a rather casual thing for a triangle, and found myself dead, rather than laughing evilly at my power. Once I hit the octotank, I sorta bounced off, and was left trying to get close again, but died before I could. What would have happened with triangle, is I would have hit him, and stayed in the exact same position as my body kept registering hits to it.\n\n- Triangle was much more efficient at escaping.\n\nTLDR; Destroyer may be able to suddenly close in on the enemy easier, but I don't really see the point when closing the distance doesn't mean certain death for the enemy, unlike it does with triangle. Triangle is better at killing enemies body damage builds are good against, and destroyer is better killing enemies it's bad against.\n\n", "created_utc": "1464394077.0", "edited": "False", "id": "d3mffxh", "is_submitter": "True", "link_id": "t3_4laxrh", "parent_id": "t1_d3mcwhl", "score": "2", "subreddit": "Diepio", "subreddit_id": "t5_3e819"}, {"author": "Rpg_gamer_", "body": "Something wrong?

He freaks out and is relieved to see the girl safe once the water gets out, noting to himself that he's grown a bit affectionate towards her. \n\n- End of chapter 1\n\n- The girl disappears when she goes to sleep at 9pm. She wakes up full of energy at 7am. He's annoyed that there's a small girl living her life in his eye.\n\n- He keeps on pinching the bridge of his nose, and acts more tired. His coworkers act a bit worried, and one of them says he should get a wife, because then she'd make him meals and stuff, and he'd feel less tired.\n\n- He doesn't really want a wife, because being alone is easier. And he doesn't really feel alone with the girl floating in his eye.\n\n- He has one of those automatically cleaning robot vacuums.\n\n\"Maybe she's appearing because I'm not satisfying my sexual needs?... No, no, no. Definitely not.\"\n\n\"Let's get in the bath. Besides, she's asleep by now, so there's nothing to worry about... Why am I basing my schedule around her...\"\n\n- She wakes up while he's bathing, and he doesn't want to be looked at and hurts himself while scrambling around.\n\n- She's happy to see him (by the looks of it), and he yells that children should be in bed at this hour.\n\n- At the office, the coworkers are worried about him again after he says he tripped in the bath and hurt himself. His coworker mentioned that he isn't getting sleep because of his daughter. The main character realizes that last night was because children don't sleep as soundly as adults in some cases. \n\n- The girl enters his vision, looking very guilty about what she did, and then runs off. He's pleased that she's a bit more behaved, and reminds himself not to use the eye wash. \n\n- A few hours after she was acting bashful, she was back to her energetic normal state and invading his space again.\n\n- End of chapter 2\n\n- He compliments the robot cleaning vacuum, and the eye girl acts all happy and glad to be complimented, but the guy corrects her and says he was talking about the robot. In the conversation he refers to both the cleaner and the robot with one of the words for \"you\", and the girl gets a bit confused, and then angry and sulky by the end of the conversation.\n\n- She stays like that for a week\n\n- The coworkers joke around with the main character again.\n\n- His coworker had \"yume\" written on his neck. Turns out that his daughter keeps writing her name everywhere she can (*why* she does isn't really explained). His coworker is a bit annoyed but pleased that she likes her name, and understands that \"she doesn't mean anything bad by it\". He starts going on for a little about how important a name is. \"It makes a conversation more personal and connected between the two talking\".\n\n- The main character reacts to that, thinking silently for a second. The coworker asks if he's thinking of something that relates to the conversation.\n\n\"No, I was just thinking that you really are a proper father, aren't you\".\n\n\"just what were you thinking of me until now? And by the way, you're really reacting to conversations about children a lot lately... DON'T TELL ME YOU KNOCKED SOM-\"\n\n\"**NO**... I've just had the chance to interact with one lately.\"\n\n\"What, a niece or something?! Do you have siblings?! I'm all ears! What's her name?\"\n\n\"A n-name? I don't...\". His hand touches the eye wash in his pocket, and he responds with the name \"Ai\". \n\n- Ai is an actual Japanese name, and is pronounced similar to the English word \"eye\" (coming from \"eye wash\"). \"Ai\" also has the meaning of \"love\" in Japanese.\n\n- The coworker thinks that it being based of the word for \"love\" is wonderful, and just as the main character is about to take back what he said because he thought it was stupid, he saw that the floating girl (now called Ai) was acting really happy.\n\n- It turns out that the eye girl just wanted a name, and was angry that there was no distinction between her and a vacuum robot because of it.\n\n- The guy sticks with the name Ai because she liked it.\n\n- Ai gets all excited whenever she sees her name on a sign or anything (there's plenty of stuff with the word \"love\" on advertisements and stuff). She even happily starts pointing at a porn dvd advertisement with the word \"love\" in.\n\n\"She's acting way too excited\". \n\n- He smiles. \n\n\"'She doesn't mean anything bad by it', huh\". (referencing a quote from his coworker when he was talking about his daughter writing her name everywhere.)\n\nThe end.\n\n--------------------\n\nI'm terribly sorry that it turned out to be like a 4chan green text story.

And in an average rpg, there are various key concepts that are often quite important to keep in mind. Such as:\n\n- the idea of compensating for your character's weaknesses with equipment, stats, or abilities. As in, a weak mage like him should develop ways to evade, but he doesn't increase his agility at all, or find a faster way to fly, or even consider the concept of teleportation.\n\n- The concept of recognizing unbalanced parts in a game and abusing them. Such as the \"physical endurance\" skill. It decreased physical damage received by 3 whole percent on its first level up. Which only took a couple hits to the body to activate. Even if it has diminishing returns and takes longer and longer to level up, you could get your physical damage taken to around 50% of what it should be with that skill.\n\n- And the will to test and observe in a game where you don't know all of the rules. Have 100 stat points? Put a couple into stats you haven't experimented with much to see how effective they are. Got a crafting skill? Experiment with it to see how different the kind of stuff you make is from bought equipment. Got a skill from touching a book? Go to a god damn library. Got a shit ton of cash?
