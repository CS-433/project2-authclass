Again, looks a bit dark/dull for my taste. \n\nThe fourth picture is my favorite.

Writing 2-10 page essays and movie scripts, listening to it for hours and hours a day up to 5 times a week engaging in conversations and debates about a VARIETY of topics, and reading articles, books, essays, plays, etc. is what I can attribute most of my skill increase to. In addition to that, I did do lessons on italki up to 3 times a week for about a month, AND I actually live in Miami where I basically live in a Spanish speaking country and can use Spanish 24/7 lol. It took me 2 years to get to this point after starting my program with no real outside studying like flash cards or keeping a journal. I\u2019d recommend sticking with italki lessons as often as you can have them, reading A LOT as that will improve your vocabulary better than any other method (imho), and watching tv/YouTube/ listening to podcasts to improve listening comprehension. Fun fact, even at my C1 level, I do have a hard time understanding Spanish on tv without subtitles but I understand YouTube videos and podcasts just fine. Just make sure you diversify whatever you intake in order to improve the fastest, even if it\u2019s boring, and make sure it\u2019s at a high level.
