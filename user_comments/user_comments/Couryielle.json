I was 19/20 at that time, mostly living away for college and secretly in my first serious relationship, which happened to be with another girl. SU was something my sister and I bonded over whenever I was home for the weekends.

I jokingly pointed out that the pink/purple/blue theme of her app looked like the bi flag. She then replied with the most controlled casualness, \"that's because I'm bi\", and it took me a ridiculous amount of self-control not to yell, I was NOT expecting her to say something like that AT ALL. Our family is more on the \"tolerate and love but don't really understand/accept\" spectrum, so even if I have full confidence my parents will still love me fully and I won't be thrown out, my currently 27 y/o ass still hasn't even come out to this day. But here was my baby sister, 13 years old, confident and trusting me enough to tell me this\n\nI asked her to show me where to change the app theme, changed it to the pansexual flag and said \"this one is me\", and I didn't even need to tell her what it was, she just went \"oh, pansexual!\" That was the very first time in my life I ever even told anyone in my family this (my mom thinks I'm asexual lel). It blew my mind, as someone who didn't even really truly realize people can sometimes just genuinely not be straight until I was 16, to see a 13 year old who already had such awareness of these things and of herself.

What we have are aspects, and trying to keep all the verbs in the same aspect in Tagalog like you would tenses in English is going to make it sound unnatural and weird to read, because Tagalog naturally uses different verb aspects regardless of whether the action happened in the past, present, or future. At least when it comes to verbs, we simply don't have the same considerations for novel writing as in English\n\nSame as in English, POV is totally dependent on the effect you want to achieve! You can easily google discussions about the pros/cons/angles you can achieve by writing in the 1st, 3rd, or even 2nd person -- this isn't something that is specific to any one language afaik. Tbh since we use the same punctuations as English anyway, I think the novel writing process (in terms of plot, POV, structure etc) is pretty much the same in Tagalog as in English (outside of verb tense/aspect)\n\nAs for tips about writing in Tagalog specifically, probably my biggest one would be to NOT transliterate sentences from English to Tagalog, which is something I have to point out a lot when editing/beta reading for others. Think about the thought you want to convey, and figure out how you would naturally say/describe that thought to someone who doesn't understand English. This takes a TON of practice, you WILL be dissatisfied and frustrated at not finding the right words that probably come faster to you in English, but it's simply something you have to keep going at until you find yourself writing Tagalog more comfortably without defaulting to English first. Basically practice writing lots of \"throwaway\" stories/essays, or maybe keep a journal in Tagalog. A lot of people assume it's easy to write in Tagalog just because you're fluent in it, but it actually does take legitimate skill, so don't be discouraged if it doesn't come as easy as you think it should! Be prepared to exercise!\n\nTip #2, ACTIVELY READ Tagalog novels. Not just assigned readings or pocketbooks/popular lit (though there's nothing wrong with them!). Active reading means you're not just absorbing the story, try to analyze how authors structure their sentences or play with POV or use imagery and idioms. Highlight parts you like/don't like and think about why you like/don't like them. We have a very rich history of published novels since the mid-1800s, hundreds of books that somehow simply never get talked about in school. If you can find them, take the time to appreciate what they have to offer.\n\nTip #3, and this is more of a practical writing tip, be mindful of ambiguous words. For example, if you have the phrase \"tatlong taong walang Diyos\" somewhere, it's a good idea to specify whether you mean \"tatlong t\u00e1ong walang Diyos\" or \"tatlong ta\u00f3ng walang Diyos\". You don't really need to put diacritics on every single word imo, just in cases where it can be read differently in a way that would change the meaning.\n\nTip #4, if you can't find an equivalent/natural sounding Tagalog term for an English word, you don't need to push it. Languages evolve, word borrowings happen, saying \"email\" instead of \"sulatroniko\" is not going to shame your ancestors or denigrate your Tagalog skills. It's okay to sprinkle deep Tagalog words here and there depending on the formality/tone/time period you're aiming for but in general if reading a single sentence would necessitate 5 trips to a dictionary, it's not gonna be that great of a reading experience (unless it's really necessary for the purpose of your novel. These are really just suggestions not hard rules lol)\n\nSORRY THIS HAS GOTTEN SO LONG I can't think of anything else to add rn but I hope this could be of help.

Also in this context \"sumali\" sounds more natural for me than \"makisali\" for reasons I can't rationalize yet at the time of typing (tho \"makisali\" isn't really wrong...?)\n\n\"Ulit na naman\" is not a viable direct replacement for \"again\". I think most people would simply say \"again\" itself. Saying just \"ulit\" mmmmight work but it kinda carries an impatient tone imo. I don't think there's a direct translation for \"again\" used in the context of reiterating an earlier statement, the closest equivalent would be \"tulad ng sinabi ko\" (as I said)\n\n\"Pinag-uusapan\" is also a verb that requires multiple actors bc one can't simply \"have a conversation among oneself\". It should be \"pinag-uusapan **namin**\"\n\nSocial media is already plural\n\n\"Tingin\" --> \"paningin\" (\"Tingin\" is like, a glance. \"Paningin\" is viewpoint)\n\nNot really a mistake but putting \"sa social media\" after \"paningin ko\" sounds more natural imo\n\n\"Dahil\" is not wrong at all but the more common/colloquial equivalent is \"kasi\"\n\n\"Duon\" --> \"doon\" (not really wrong, just a pedantic correction)\n\n\"May malakas na opinyon ako\" is not really wrong, but it kinda sticks out as an obvious transliteration...? It also makes HAVING strong opinions the point of the sentence instead of having STRONG opinions. I'd probably say \"malakas ang opinyon ko\" to get the latter point across (tho I really feel like \"malakas\" isn't quite the right adjective, but I can't think of anything that sounds more natural rn)\n\n\"Gumitna\" can also be \"pumagitna\" in this case. \"Gumitna\" is for placing oneself in the middle so tbh it works fine but \"pumagitna\" is SPECIFICALLY for placing oneself between two opposing/arguing sides. \"Gumitna\" may require context when used for conflict but \"pumagitna\" doesn't\n\n\"Nahihirapan**g** kumampi\" kinda implies that you are, until the very time of typing, actively having a hard time picking a side. That's a valid statement, but if you mean to say that you find it hard to take sides *in general*, you can say \"sobrang hirap para saking kumampi\"\n\n\"Hindi parang paniki\" is not exactly wrong, but its meaning is closer to \"not bat-like\" (or with the whole phrase, \"not like *a* bat in our story\"). If you want to say \"unlike the bat\", it'd be \"hindi **katulad ng** paniki\"\n\n\"di ako nawalan ng anuman**g** kaibigan\" sticks out as a transliteration, you can simply say \"di ako nawalan ng kaibigan\". \"Sinumang kaibigan\" also works but \"anumang kaibigan\" is more of \"any kind of friend\"\n\n\"Sa kwento nito\" --> \"sa kwentong ito\"\n\n\"nga\" --> \"sa\" ? (I'm assuming it's a typo)\n\n\"Lumalaban ang mga ibon sa mga hayop\" -- grammatically 100% correct, semantically also totally acceptable. It simply means \"the birds are fighting the animals\", which sounds a bit neutral. Depending on the context of the story, you can also say \"**nilalabanan** ng mga ibon ang mga hayop\" (the birds are fighting *against* the animals) or \"**nakikipaglaban** ang mga ibon sa mga hayop (the birds are fighting *with* the animals) to be more descriptive\n\n\"Tumatahimik at naduduwag siya\" -- oh man I'm not sure if I can explain this right. Though it IS grammatically correct, something feels off about it to me and I think it has to do with the fact that \"tumatahimik\" is a dynamic verb and \"naduduwag\" is a stative verb? It's like saying \"he shuts up and is scared\", it's not wrong but it doesn't quite match. For better verb parallelism (?) it probably sounds smoother to turn them both into stative and say \"natahimik at naduwag siya\" (perfective aspect because he's already done reacting)\n\n\"Hindi siya kumampi\" is not really wrong by itself, but \"wala siyang kinampihan\" answers the question better. The focus of \"kumampi\" is the bat while the focus of \"kinampihan\" is the side that was chosen, which is what the question is about\n\n\"Nag-iisa siya\" is not wrong but it's simply a neutral declarative statement. \"Nag-iisa na siya\" would give the meaning that he wasn't along before but now he is\n\n\"Makisama\" is more of \"to be in solidarity/harmony *with*\" (meaning you have to use *sa* with what you're being in solidarity/harmony with) but with active effort put into it. \"Nakisama ako **sa** kaibigan ko sa sinehan\" gives the impression of \"I put up with my friend at the theater\"\n\n\"Kung paano nawawalan ng mga binti nila ang mga pating?\" -- 1) In the \"kung\" + [question word] structure, the \"kung\" removes the questioning property of the question word and turns it into a relative pronoun. Just like how in \"the person *who* arrived\" or \"the place *where* I live\", who/where aren't asking questions, the paano in \"kung paano\" isn't asking a question. The kung also makes the whole phrase a relative phrase, which feels incomplete without the noun it's describing, so you can either say \"ang kwento kung paano [...]\" or simply drop \"kung\"; 2) \"Nawawalan\" means their legs disappearing is a regular occurrence up to now; 3) Not every single element of the English version of the sentence needs to be translated! Trying to translate every element from English can actually just make the structure confusing to look at in Tagalog on first read. You can just say \"paano nawalan ng binti ang mga pating\" or \"paano nawala ang binti ng mga pating\" and it would still naturally translate to \"how sharks lost their legs\" (or \"how shark legs disappeared\")\n\n\"Pero nung isang araw\" -- \"nung isang araw\" means \"just the other day\", this should just be \"pero isang araw\"\n\n\"na hindi nakakahanap ng pagkain kahit saan\" -- this is more of \"who is not finding food anywhere\". It sounds more natural to use the infinitive: \"na hindi **makahanap** ng pagkain kahit saan\" (who couldn't find food anywhere) or the perfective: \"na hindi **nakahanap** ng pagkain kahit saan\" (who hadn't been able to food anywhere)\n\n\"Pumutol ang mga tao ng binti ng bawat pating\" -- grammatically correct, but the focus here is on the humans when it should naturally be on the shark's legs. \"Pinutol ng mga tao ang binti ng bawat pating\" also parallels the focus on the leg of the man in the previous sentence, so you can even say \"pinutol **din** ng mga tao\" to emphasize that it's retaliation\n\n[BONUS: to emphasize the anger of the humans, you can say \"pinagpuputol ng mga tao ang binti ng bawat pating\". If you put the stress on the last syllable, the *pinag-* + [repeat first 2 letters of the root word] structure can mean that the action was done in a frenzy/with abandon, e.g. \"pinatay\" means \"killed\" but \"pin\u00e1gpapat\u00e1y\" means \"went on a killing rampage\"; \"binil\u00ed\" mean \"bought\", \"pinagb\u00edbili\" means \"is selling/is buying for\", \"pin\u00e1gbibil\u00ed\" means \"bought like there's no tomorrow\"]\n\n\"Dahil wala nang binti\" --> \"dahil wala na **silang** binti\" (the phrase felt incomplete)\n\n\"ilalim ng dagat\" --> \"**sa** ilalim ng dagat\"\n\n-----\n\nCan I just say though, you're doing an incredible job with Tagalog! Some awkward wordings here and there (not rly due to grammatical mistakes but simply due to Tagalog having a different way of expressing thoughts than English) but nothing incomprehensible. Most of the suggestions I had were just tips on how to make some things sound more natural, you have the basics down hella good already!\n\nAnyway I probably repeated a lot of the points other editors have already made (haven't checked the whole doc properly yet) but hopefully I've also covered some bases that others haven't.

I sincerely apologize for the length of this info dump, I tried to be as succinct but thorough as I can. Pls don't worry, a lot of this is just me being nitpicky/pedantic about spelling or offering more nuanced but optional alternatives \ud83d\ude05 you're not required to follow every single comment I make, it's just that I saw that you seem to be at a quite advanced level so I threw in a lot of nuance comments instead of just straight up correcting grammar\n\n-----\n\n[Susi]\n\n\"E di\" is more of \"if that's the case\" and \"manatili\" is more of \"to remain in a certain way/state\" so \"di ako gumagamit ng bag edi di nananatili sa bag ko ang mga susi ko\" sounds more like \"I don't use bags, if that's the case my keys don't remain in my bag\". I would suggest using \"kaya\" (so) instead of \"e di\". If you don't really put your keys in your bag, you can say \"di ko nilalagay\" or \"wala sa bag ko\"\n\nIt's a good practice to separate affixes and loan words with a hyphen, so while \"magfocus\" isn't wrong and is something a lot of people (including me) would sometimes also write, \"mag-focus\" is much easier to read\n\n\"Di ako napakagaling\" is not wrong, but \"di ako masyadong magaling\" or \"di ako ganoon kagaling\" sound more natural\n\nWhen adding a prefix that ends with a consonant to a root word that starts with a vowel, a hyphen is very preferred, so it's \"mag-aral\". All words that start with a vowel when written actually start with a glottal stop when spoken, and the hyphen denotes that. \"Magaral\" gets instinctively read as ma-ga-ral, which isn't a real word (tho I don't doubt some people spell it like this for the sake of speed/character space)\n\n\"Mahirap akong mag-focus\" sounds off bc what's being described by \"mahirap\" here is \"ako\" and not \"mag-focus\". \"Nahihirapan akong mag-focus\" is how most ppl would say it (\"mahirap para sakin mag-focus\" is also 100% natural, so u good!)\n\n\"Tsaka\" is short for \"at saka\", so \"at tsaka\" is redundant (this point is admittedly kinda just me being pedantic lol sorry)\n\n\"Nakikipag-chat ako ng best friend ko\" sounds off. You talk *to*/chat *with* a person, so in Tagalog it's \"nakikipag-chat ako **sa** best friend ko\" (I know in English it's valid to say \"I chatted you\" but \"chat\" in Tagalog is mostly treated as just another word for \"usap\" [through a chat client])\n\n\"Laging nawawala ni Sandra mga susi niya\" -- no real corrections here, just wanted to say this is such a natural sounding spoken sentence lol. \"Ang\" very very often gets dropped in casual conversation. If you're writing academically though, probably best to write \"ang mga susi\"\n\n\"Miyerkoles\" --> \"Miyerkules\" (not really wrong, just a pedantic correction)\n\n\"Parang hindi siya nagtatrabaho sa [day]\" -- this is not really wrong, but I think \"(ka)pag\"/\"tuwing\" would sound more natural than \"sa\". \"Sa\" kinda gives me the impression that her not working on that day is only for that specific upcoming day, which puts it at odds with the habitual/repeating \"nagtatrabaho\". \"Pag\" means it's every occurrence of that day and not just a one time thing. It's like the difference between \"she doesn't work on Thursday\" and \"she doesn't work on Thursday**s**\"\n\n\"Araw araw\" --> \"araw-araw\" (not really wrong, just a pedantic correction)\n\n\"Plana\" --> \"plano\" (plana isn't a word haha)\n\n\"Magkasama\" is a... plural? mutual action?? verb. Putting *magka-* in a verb means the action is being done together/to each other by the subjects, so it can only take plural subjects. You can say \"gusto kong magkasama **kami** ng best friend ko\" or \"gusto kong **makasama** ang best friend ko\"\n\n\"Magzoom\" --> \"mag-Zoom\". You can also say \"makapag-Zoom\". The former isn't wrong, but it's like the difference between saying \"be with my best friend to Zoom\" vs \"be with my best friend so we can Zoom\"", "created_utc": "1647403340.0", "edited": "False", "id": "i0uej2y", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_tet41o", "parent_id": "t3_tet41o", "score": "3", "subreddit": "Tagalog", "subreddit_id": "t5_2t8bg"}, {"author": "Couryielle", "body": "If only for the sake of learning the language, I'd say there's no issue with you guys using \"po\" with each other, but as many other people have pointed out, po/opo is really typically not used at all between siblings (except sometimes with very young [essentially beginner level!] kids to teach them how to use it). I'm an older sibling and if my younger siblings suddenly started unironically using \"po\" with me, I would feel like I did something wrong to cause them to be distant/tiptoe around me, but that's only because we're all fluent enough that we don't need to practice using po all the time like we did when we were <4 years old\n\nBasically at this stage you can either choose to use \"po\" because you're still beginner level speakers or not use \"po\" because you're already adult siblings, your choice", "created_utc": "1646719790.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hzt25g8", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_t8zbkp", "parent_id": "t3_t8zbkp", "score": "1", "subreddit": "Tagalog", "subreddit_id": "t5_2t8bg"}, {"author": "Couryielle", "body": "I would encourage convincing your mom to speak it to you, it's your best bet to getting direct exposure to the language.

Then, a few seconds later while I was still puzzling over what I just happened, she suddenly toppled backwards. I was too stunned to see it happening again that I froze, and she hit the ground and cracked the back of her head. It turns out she was having a mild stroke at that time. I started crying in disbelief and guilt, I KNEW she would fall, I LITERALLY, PHYSICALLY saw it happen just seconds before, but I couldn't move when it actually did.

It's similar to how multiple adjectives tend to appear in a certain order in English (e.g. \"big red rubber ball\" feels more natural than \"rubber red big ball\")\n\nSo in the absence of other ingklitik, *po* would be the second element in a sentence, such as your example where \"maligayang bati\" is considered as one unit. \"Maligaya **po**ng bati\" is also acceptable, though the underlying structure is slightly different bc this time \"maligaya\" and \"bati\" are considered separate elements.

Words that begin with /m/, /n/, and /w/ NEVER use -um- full stop\n1. When the subject acquires a trait they didn't have before, -um- is used but ~~never~~ almost never mag- [e.g. \"tumaba\" not \"\\*nagtaba\"; \"sumigla\" not \"\\*nagsigla\", \"gumanda\" not \"\\*nagganada\"]. An exception I literally only thought of when I was about to hit send was \"dumilim\" and \"nagdilim\" both being acceptable (albeit with a subtle difference)\n1. Foreign words HIGHLY favor mag- over -um-. The only foreign origin words I can think of that can use -um- are Spanish loan words that have been in the language so long they've become naturalized [e.g. \"rumesponde\" feels a bit more natural than \"nagresponde\" but both are acceptable; \"pumrotekta\" and \"nagprotekta\" sound about equally natural to me; \"pumost\" sounds distinctly off compared to \"nag-post\" and might require context to understand]\n1. In cases where both -um- and mag- don't change the meaning, -um- can feel slightly more intentional/deliberate/forceful than mag- [e.g. \"pumunta\" can feel more deliberate than \"nagpunta\"; \"lumakad\" can feel more deliberate than \"naglakad\"; \"sumulat\" can feel more deliberate than \"nagsulat\"]. However this is just a very subtle difference in most cases, and most people wouldn't even realize this unless they really think about it. Using one or the other doesn't really affect everyday convo\n1. In cases where -um- and mag- cause change in meaning, -um- tends to be about the doer performing the action on/by themself (intransitive) while mag- tends to be about performing the action on something else (transitive) [e.g. \"pumasok\" (the doer goes inside) vs \"nagpasok\" (the doer puts something inside); \"sumakay\" (the doer hitches a ride) vs \"nagsakay\" (the doer lets someone/something else hitch a ride); \"sumabit\" (the doer gets caught on/hangs on to something) vs \"nagsabit\" (the doer hangs something up)]\n\nAs for what words fall under the cases in \"rule\" 4 and 5... there's no rule for telling. Outside of \"rule\" 1 and 2 there's also no universal way of telling which words can or can't take mag-/-um-. I don't know why \"kumain\" and \"nagsabi\" are acceptable but \"\\*nagkain\" and \"\\*sumabi\" sound weird, it's just not something native speakers can explain. The applications of mag- and -um- also go beyond just what I listed -- you may even find usages that conflict with what I've written here (which is why I put \"rules\" in quotes)\n\nOverall I agree with the other commenter, the only real way to tell which one is appropriate to use in any given situation is to just be familiar enough with which contexts use which.

However, the general pattern seems to be that *-um-* tends to be reflexive/intransitive, reflecting actions done by the actor to themself and/or by themself, while *mag-* seems to have the actor involving something/someone else.\n\nSome examples:\n\n**Case 1:** ***-um-*** **but not** ***mag-***\n\nk\u00e1in (to eat)\n\n* kum\u00e1in - the actor is eating\n* \\*magkain - not standard Tagalog; often used by Bisaya speakers\n\nsak\u00edt (to hurt/be in pain)\n\n* sumak\u00edt - the actor is a body part and it is in pain\n* \\*magsak\u00edt - not standard Tagalog\n\n**Case 2:** ***-mag-*** **but not** ***-um-***\n\n\u00e1lay (to offer)\n\n* mag-\u00e1lay - the actor is offering something (or sacrificing someone)\n* \\*umalay - not standard Tagalog\n\nlut\u00f2 (to cook)\n\n* maglut\u00f2 - the actor is cooking something\n* \\*lumuto - not standard Tagalog\n\nwal\u00eds (to sweep)\n\n* magwal\u00eds - the actor is sweeping an area\n* \\*wumalis - very much not standard Tagalog; it is also awkward to say\n\npost, comment, like, subscribe\n\n* mag-post, mag-comment, mag-like, mag-subscribe\n* \\*pumost, \\*kumomment/kumomento, \\*lumike, \\*sumubscribe - these all look and feel terrible\n\n**Case 3: both, but with not that much difference (opinions may vary)**\n\npunt\u00e1 (to go)\n\n* pumunt\u00e1 - the actor is going to a location (somewhat purposefully -- this is what you use when giving directions)\n* magpunt\u00e1 - that actor is going to a location (somewhat neutrally -- the actor may or may not have intended to go there)\n\nl\u00e1kad (to walk; to go on a journey)\n\n* lum\u00e1kad - the actor is walking; the actor going to on a journey\n* maglak\u00e1d - the actor is walking (not taking a ride or anything else -- they are putting one foot in front of the other to move forward; used hilariously/sarcastically when inanimate objects are not found in their proper place, implying that they grew legs and walked to another location)\n* magl\u00e1kad - the actor is pushing affairs (usually paperwork) forward\n\npat\u00e1y (to die)\n\n* pumat\u00e1y - the actor is killing something/someone\n* magpatay - a bit questionable because the only context I can think of where this is acceptable is \"magpatay ng ilaw\" (to turn off/kill the lights), otherwise it doesn't make sense.

However, *yung* is not considered \"formal\" so it's generally avoided in academic writing, hence Google translate not quite factoring it in.\n\nAnother thing, formal writing has an overwhelming preference for using reverse/unnatural sentence order, which is not wrong at all but also is not really something naturally spoken (complex sentences seem to be a different matter in this regard but that's an essay for another day).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The apple is red**\n\n*(Kulay) pula ang mansanas.* \\[stating an observation\\]\n\n*(Kulay) pula yung mansanas.* \\[relaying info about the apple you saw/have\\]\n\n**It is John's apple**\n\n*Mansanas ito ni John.*\n\n**I give John the apple**\n\n*Binigay ko yung mansanas kay John.* \\[*binibigyan* is technically not incorrect, but it carries the default implication that the action is still in progress, i.e. \"I am currently in the process of giving John the apple.\" The imperfective aspect is for actions in the middle of being done or actions that occur regularly, and since there's nothing in the original sentence that pertains to repeated action, it feels more natural to say \"I gave John the apple.\" This is the same logic for the next three sentences\\]\n\n**We give him the apple**\n\n*Binigay namin sa kanya yung mansanas*\n\n**He gives it to John**\n\n*Binigay niya ito kay John.*\n\n**She gives it to him**\n\n*Binibigay niya ito sa kanya.*\n\n**Is the apple red?**\n\n*(Kulay) pula ba ang mansanas?* \\[this can feel like \"Are apples red?\" asked as a general question, since it's not necessary to use the plural form to indicate plural\\]\n\n*(Kulay) pula ba yung mansanas?* \\[this is the one that more naturally translates back to the original sentence\\]\n\n**The apples are red**\n\n*Pula yung mansanas.*\n\n*Pula yung mga mansanas.* \\[optionally used if you want to point out that there is more than one apple\\]\n\n**I must give it to him**\n\n*Kailangan kong ibigay ito sa kanya.* \\[lit. \"I need to give it to him/her.\" *Dapat* is more of \"should\", so \"Dapat ibigay ko sa kanya\" is more of \"I should give (it) to him/her\"\\]\n\n**I want to give it to her**\n\n*Gusto kong ibigay ito sa kanya.*\n\n**I'm going to know tomorrow**\n\n*Malalaman ko bukas.*\n\n**I can't eat the apple**\n\n*Hindi ko kayang kainin yung mansanas.* \\[pragmatically, the speaker is referring to a very specific apple here so using *ang* would sound out-of-place/formal as heck. \"Hindi ko makakain ang mansanas\" is more of \"I will not be able to eat apples\"\\]\n\n**I have eaten the apple**\n\n*Nakain ko na yung mansanas.* \\[again, it only makes sense that the speaker is referring to a specific apple, not apples in general. \"Kumain na ako ng mansanas\" is more of \"I have already eaten an apple/I ate an apple just a bit earlier\"\\]\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf anyone has any corrections or questions or additions, please let me know \\^\\^", "created_utc": "1617103625.0", "edited": "1617104281.0", "id": "gssf9fu", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_mfpng7", "parent_id": "t3_mfpng7", "score": "3", "subreddit": "Tagalog", "subreddit_id": "t5_2t8bg"}, {"author": "Couryielle", "body": "I haven't really been following the event cycles so I'm confused, didn't we already have the current EN/WW Kotori UR event?

Sorry in advance for the extensive notes bc I wanted to give you options for choosing nuances\n\n>> If I could have a thousand (dreams)\n\n>Kung magkakaro\u00f3n ak\u00f3 ng is\u00e1ng libong (pangarap/panaginip)\n\nBy *dreams* here do you mean \"I dream of being successful in the future\" or \"I dream of you every night when I sleep\"? The former is *pangarap* and the latter is *panaginip*\n\n>>They wouldn't measure what you mean to me\n\n>Hind\u00ee nil\u00e1 masusukat kung gaano ka kahalag\u00e1 sa akin\n\nA shorter alternative is *hindi nila masusukat ang halag\u00e1 mo sa akin*, which would be closer to \"they wouldn't (be able to) measure your value/importance to me\"\n\n>>I can't explain this fire that's been burning\n\n>>When all I've known is rain\n\n>Hind\u00ee ko maipaliwanag itong ap\u00f3y na nagliliy\u00e1b\n\n>Gay\u00f3ng ang tanging al\u00e1m ko lang ay ul\u00e1n\n\n*Sunog* in *nasusunog* refers more to something that is being burned by the fire, *liy\u00e1b* is more about the flames itself? Like, \"nasusunog ang x\" means \"x is burning\" while \"nagliliy\u00e1b ang x\" is more \"x is on fire\". Something can *liy\u00e1b* (be on fire OR metaphorically feel like it's on fire, e.g. a fever or anger or patriotic fervor) without being *sunog* (burned off/out/away)\n\n>>But the storm is clearing now\n\n>>And the way the sun is shining like I've never felt its warmth before\n\n>Ngunit nahahaw\u00ec na ang bagy\u00f3\n\n>At tila ba ngay\u00f3n ko lang nadam\u00e1 ang init ng sikat ng araw\n\nThis is more of \"but the storm is being swept away\" because I can't think of a more appropriate term for the clearing of the skies OTL\n\nThe next line is more \"and it feels like it's only now that I felt the warmth of the light (lit. shine) of the sun\". *Ningn\u00edng* in *pagniningn\u00edng* does mean shine, but like in a shimmery/twinkly kind of way so it refers more to stars :'D *sikat* is the in-your-face kind of shine that is automatically associated with the sun. Alternatively, *sinag* refers to the rays of the sun, so you can also use \"sinag ng araw\" instead\n\n>>If I could have a thousand dreams\n\n>>They couldn't measure what you mean to me\n\n>Kung magkakaro\u00f3n ako ng is\u00e1ng libong (pangarap/panaginip)\n\n>Hind\u00ee nil\u00e1 masusukat kung gaano ka kahalag\u00e1 sa akin\n\nBtw you can shorten *hind\u00ee* (no/not) to just *d\u00ec*, if it would help with the metre\n\nAlso I just realized, an alternative way to say the first line is \"magkaro\u00f3n man ako ng is\u00e1ng libong (pangarap/panaginip)\", which has the sense of \"even if I have a thousand dreams\" instead of \"in the event that I have a thousand dreams\"\n\n>>If I could have a thousand wishes they'd all be the same\n\n>>To be with you tomorrow\n\n>Kung magkakaro\u00f3n (/magkaro\u00f3n man) ako ng is\u00e1ng libong hil\u00edng, pare-pareho lang sil\u00e1ng lah\u00e1t\n\n>Ang (makapiling/makasama) ka bukas\n\nBoth *makapiling* and *makasama* are used in the context of being together with someone, but the nuance is that the latter comes from *sama* (to go with/be included) while the former comes from *piling*, which is a concept that's hard to put into words... it's like if you want to be with/by/in someone's *piling*, you want to exist by their side and be part of their life? So *makapiling* is much deeper and more emotionally involved than just *makasama*\n\nBut then when I asked my mom, she said she'd probably choose *makasama* in the case of your lyrics bc she feels *makasama* is for tomorrow while *makapiling* is for the rest of your life lol. I see her point but also *makapiling ka bukas* doesn't feel too weird for me personally, just very emotional and passionate about being with someone tomorrow.

I absolutely hate spoilers and managed to mostly avoid them the entire run of the anime so needless to say, I was pissed beyond words that I accidentally found out about the end to such ridiculous detail. I even figured out by myself that Ash staggering in the OP was most likely him walking to his death (I was right). No matter how much I wanted to forget everything and go into the finale blind, the damage had already been done so I thought, what the hell, might as well steel myself. I've been preparing for him to die since at least Episode 2 anyway\n\nSince I thought I already knew the ending so well, there were many important things things that ended up catching me off guard. First of all I thought Ash would die in the final battle, so between Dino falling off the building up to the time Ash sat down to read Eiji's letter, I actually really thought there was a chance I've been had. It was like watching a soldier survive the entire war against all odds and hoping they'll have a restful peace time, only for them to die of a random mishap when they're finally on their way home\n\nSecondly, I did not know about Eiji's letter *at all*. I thought Ash would be fighting until the very end, I did not expect he would go out in peace like that. It's one thing knowing one of your favorite characters of all time was going to die and even knowing what causes his death, it's an entirely different thing watching him practically willingly go into death's arms while being assured how loved he was. I lost it so, so hard\n\nLastly, although this isn't about the anime anymore, absolutely *nothing* prepared me for Garden of Light. *Nothing*. All I knew since long before was that it's a sequel set some years in the future and it's a required reading that will supposedly help people heal, but I completely forgot about it until I saw it in the table of contents for Volume 19 (I read the manga at the anime's pace). Help people heal, my ass. I watched the anime in the morning, cried hard until lunch time, read the events of the finale in the manga up to GoL in the afternoon, and cried *very* hard well into dinner (as in I seriously started crying into my food just because I remembered how Eiji used to cook for Ash, and how he'll never be able to cook for him ever again. My sister laughed at me). When my brother, who hadn't seen me all day because he was at work, got home later that night, the first thing he asked is if I was okay because my eyes looked so fucked\n\nI emptied out more than half of our one new tissue pack that day. A day or two later, I sat my sister down and watched the whole anime with her. We took a break after Episode 20 and I went to read the rest of the side stories, thinking the worst is over. Hell no, Private Opinion really went and tore me a fucking new one. Then I went to reread GoL again and miraculously managed to stop short of consuming the last square of tissue, which conveniently went into use when I saw the last episode again. My usually emotionally unexpressive sister didn't cry at the finale, which is something I expected, but then some time later she started asking me where the tissue was, and I had nothing to left give her but [this](https://i.imgur.com/0lUP6NY.jpg). Turns out she started reading GoL afterwards and it's what got her good lol.

I still cried very hard\n\nI remember how one of the underlying themes in Yuri on Ice is how love alone can't save you, it helps but you're still the one who has to save yourself. I was literally just thinking, right before watching this episode, how that theme could apply to Banana Fish, since wasn't it pretty clear that love had saved Ash? But the ending made me realize, that's just my desperate wish. I want him to be happy so bad that I completely overlooked how broken he was as a person near the end. I mean, Episode 23 was basically about him rejecting the love that Eiji gave him freely, the one thing that could help him save himself. It's so easy to say \"but he's already free! He has such a good future that he can now grasp!\" when you're not the one going through what he has, processing the world through his eyes. His suicide was the result of a tragic combination of shitty factors, but it's one of many possible endings that makes narrative sense, no matter how much I wish it never happened. And in the end Cain was right, no one can kill Ash but himself\n\nIt'll take me a long time to accept this ending but to my own surprise, I don't hate it as much as I think I should. Sure it's a tragedy for the sake of tragedy, bury your gays kind of ending, but I guess we need to remember that sometimes everything can go right and still end up wrong. It just really blows that this had to happen to *him*, that it had to be in *this* story of all stories. I've loved Ash literally since he kicked that one thug down in Episode 1.

(I will go to the mall **today**.)\n* Pupunta ako sa mall **mamaya**. (I will go to the mall **later today**.)\n* Pupunta ako sa mall **bukas**. (I will go to the mall **tomorrow**.)\n\nThese senses of time can be combined with other words to be more specific when telling time. For example, to say \"last \\[unit of time\\]\" or \"next \\[unit of time\\],\" you say \"noong nakaraang \\[x\\]\" and \"sa susunod na \\[x\\].\" \"This \\[x\\]\" is \"ngayong \\[x\\]\"\n\nUnits of time:\n\n* *segundo* (second)\n* *minuto* (minute)\n* *oras* (hour)\n* *araw* (day)\n* *linggo* (week, also the word for Sunday)\n* *buwan* (month, also the word for moon)\n* *taon* (year)\n\nSo for example, last week is \"noong nakaraang linggo,\" this week is \"ngayong linggo,\" and next week is \"sa susunod na linggo.\"\n\n* Naglakad ako sa parke **noong nakaraang buwan**. (I went for a walk in the park **last month**.)\n* Pupunta ako sa probinsiya **sa susunod na linggo**. (I will go to the province **next week**.)\n* Ga-graduate ako **ngayong taon**. (I will graduate **this year**.)\n\nYou can say \"noong nakaraang araw\" and \"sa susunod na araw,\" they don't sound weird at all but it's just faster to say \"kahapon\" and \"bukas\" (plus \"sa susunod na araw\" is more along the lines of \"the following day\" instead of \"tomorrow\")\n\nLastly, a day is roughly divided into 5 parts:\n\n* *umaga* (morning, around 5\\~10am)\n* *tanghali* (noon, around 10am\\~2pm)\n* *hapon* (afternoon, around 2\\~6pm)\n* *gabi* (evening, around 6pm\\~12mn)\n* *madaling-araw* (I'm not sure what this is in English, but it's around 12mn\\~5am)\n\nYou can combine these with *kanina/ngayon/mamaya* to specify the time of the day something happened earlier/is happening today/will happen later today\n\n* Umulan nang malakas **kaninang hapon**.

This is likely what books mean when they say \"social distance\" but in the case of \"grabe siya\" you definitely have to be close to the person to make that statement.

It's mostly used with people you talk to regularly but still want to show respect for (e.g. elders and superiors). This is also the default pronoun to use with strangers, though you can still make it more respectful by using *sila*\n\n*Sila* is an even greater leap back since, semantically speaking, you're not even addressing your listener anymore, making it the most respectful in tone out of the three. It's used with people you're meeting for the first time and/or you don't foresee ever meeting again, or people whom you believe deserve almost reverent respect (though it might be awkward to keep using *sila* if you have to talk to that same person regularly). People in the service industry tend to use this to show even greater respect to their customers than what *kayo* implies.

The closest thing Tagalog has to English present tense is imperfective aspect, but since you can use imperfective aspect in the past and future, it's not always a very good indicator that the verb is in the present. The tense (i.e. the time the action happened) in Tagalog can really only be gleaned from context or time adverbs,  but not from the verb itself\n\nAs for advice on improving:\n\n1. Avoid mentally translating English to Tagalog word for word. Verbs that appear as present tense in English don't always translate to imperfective aspect in Tagalog (and vice versa) so the good news is you don't have to stick to writing like that :) Bad news is you really just have to know which situations use imperfectives or other different ways of expressing present tense in Tagalog, but since you're already somewhat fluent this shouldn't be much of a problem!\n\n1. Write your stream of consciousness thoughts in Tagalog/Taglish just to get used to getting the language down on paper, or try writing about something as if you were telling another person about it, not writing a school essay on it. Scriptwriting especially deals with language as it is spoken so if it sounds awkward to you or your parents, it will most probably sound awkward to anyone who knows the language\n\n1. Don't try to brute force verbs into looking a certain way if that's not what your heart dictates. Trust you native instincts. If it feels like it's happening in the present or looks like a present tense verb in English but looks like a \"past\" perfective or a \"future\" contemplative verb in Tagalog, it most likely really is still present tense\n\n(Sorry if this isn't what you were looking for OTL I originally wrote a long-ass essay detailing how English tense-aspects and Tagalog aspects translate to each other but there is just so much \ud83d\ude02 if you need specific help with expressing English nuances in Tagalog or vice versa feel free to ask)", "created_utc": "1539365983.0", "edited": "False", "id": "e7nbtri", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_9nid39", "parent_id": "t3_9nid39", "score": "6", "subreddit": "Tagalog", "subreddit_id": "t5_2t8bg"}, {"author": "Couryielle", "body": "This has been happening to me almost as much as 1 goods and 1 misses lately.

It's not like we can't speak pure Tagalog, we can *afford* not to speak full Tagalog because we know, instinctively and automatically, just what to keep and what to take away in order to communicate more efficiently.

English vocabulary slipping into the language is inevitable.

She came into our household some time after I was born so I literally don't remember a day she wasn't there for me in my childhood. She taught me the most basic human skills like how to bathe, how to brush my teeth, how to wear clothes etc. She's also the single kindest, most understanding, most unconditionally loving person I've ever known\n\nShe started getting sick and having nervous breakdowns when I was around 8 so she had to leave home for a while, but she recovered in about a year and came back to take care of me again. When I was in college her sickness relapsed. She had very bad insomnia and couldn't sleep more than maybe an hour or two between days, and she was constantly on edge and tired and paranoid because of it. I was living in uni but decided to move back home to take care of her and my younger siblings, while still going to school in a city 3 hours away\n\nShe rarely left her room and always looked constantly lost and tired. She couldn't bear to even look at my baby sister because she would get absolutely convinced that she would die horribly in front of her eyes. She's a very devout person and she has asked me to take her to church at 4 in the morning, crying inconsolably, because she thinks God has abandoned her. Then she got better again after extensive medical intervention, but shortly after she had to go back to the province to take care of her aging parents. I took her out and we spent her last day in the city together. It was the last time I saw her\n\nAbout two years later, her condition relapsed. We started talking less and less on the phone, and eventually when I called she would just give the phone to someone else because she couldn't bear talking to me anymore in her condition. I started hearing horror stories from my cousins about how she started talking to herself or playing with her food or prancing around outside the house, how she can't be talked to anymore\n\nThe medical treatment she needed was in the capital city where my family lived. In February this year, I had a business trip to a relatively nearby province and pleaded with my family to let me pass by her town and take her home with me, all on my expense. I even pleaded with my boss to let me forfeit my return ticket home, at my own expense too. My family and Aunt Ewin's family kept dissuading me, saying they didn't want me to go through the trouble in such a farflung area where I don't even speak the language, that maybe I couldn't handle her fits during the journey (which would take two days on land), that I should use my money for something more worthwhile blah blah blah like I wouldn't move heaven and earth to see her whole again, like she wasn't worth all the money I had to give. In the end they assured me a male cousin would take her to the capital, and I capitulated and took my flight home, aiming to use my money to help with her treatments instead\n\nThey never came. She died 3 months later, 900 kilometers away, out of her mind, and I never got to see her again. I was willing to use all the means I had to get her help. Everyone brushed me aside but did absolutely nothing for her\n\nShe would have turned 60 last week. I know she'd be sad that I feel like this but I still can't let go of my fury until now. She treated me like her own and raised me with all the love and care in the world. Her death was so fucking pointless and miserable.

Again, education and how often someone actually uses English in their daily life factor into how well they can preserve the original pronunciation of the English loanwords when speaking Taglish, and it affects not just consonants but vowels too\n\nFor example, someone who's more used to speaking/whose native language is English might say a sentence like \"November na yung festival\" (the festival is on November) not only with *November* as /nuh-vem-buh/ and  *festival* as /fes-tuh-vuhl/ but also possibly *na* and *yung* with a more American twang. This is the stereotype (with good basis actually) for affluent people and it's pretty distinct because it sounds so off\n\nPeople who use English extensively at work or school but still use mostly Tagalog in every day life have a roughly equal chance of pronouncing *November* as /noh-vem-ber/ (not with an 'uh' sound) or /noh-bem-ber/ and *festival* as /fes-ti-val/, /fes-ti-bal/, or /pes-ti-bal/ at any given time. Tagalog words in Taglish sentences are kept the same. This is the case for a majority of the working class and people in higher education whom you're more likely to meet in international online spaces (like Reddit lol). The first case (/noh-vem-ber/ and /fes-ti-val/) is also how Taglish sounds like in media\n\nChildren and people who aren't fluent (yet) in English definitely use /noh-bem-ber/ and /pes-ti-bal/ by default, and they tend to pull the people from the previous paragraph towards this pronunciation when conversing\n\n**TL;DR** there's a sliding scale of pronunciations depending on how much English people regularly use in their daily life.

When they tell me that I'll just waste my time and effort in a dying country, I tell them I'm not killing my country any further by abandoning her right at the time she needs me most\n\nDenis Ten was a huge inspiration for me in that respect. He brought Kazakhstan to the world stage when he could have easily (probably) been more prosperous somewhere else, and he did it so that the people of his own country can have someone to look up to and believe in. Beyond loving how much life he breathes into his skating, his impact and the legacy he left behind for his country is something I can only ever hope to emulate in my life.

I guess it's just considered as an aspect in Tagalog for ease of classification -- unlike English where you have both tense and aspect and  can have multiple infinitives for the same verb (e.g. *to go*, *to have gone*, *to be going*, etc.), in Tagalog there's only one infinitive for each regular verb affix and its three states of completion, so why not just include \"infinitive\" under that umbrella term for \"forms of the verb that you gotta know\" lol (I pulled this explanation from my ass)", "created_utc": "1532660028.0", "edited": "1532660339.0", "id": "e33xd1z", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_91uzg8", "parent_id": "t1_e33na1u", "score": "2", "subreddit": "Tagalog", "subreddit_id": "t5_2t8bg"}, {"author": "Couryielle", "body": "Aspect works differently in Russian and Tagalog -- iirc in Russian perfective and imperfective are different variations of the same verb that can be inflected separately. In Tagalog, imperfective and perfective are just inflections of the same verb\n\nAs /u/MrGerbear said, there are 4 main aspects in Tagalog:\n\n- infinitive - the default or basic form of the verb\n- perfective - action that has already been completed\n- imperfective - action that has been started but not yet completed\n- contemplative - action that has yet to be started\n\nThe inflected forms happen to correspond by default to past, present, and future, but the reason why the term \"tense\" is impractical to use is because the different forms of the verbs can be applied to different points in time. Tagalog verbs don't care about what time the action happened,  all they care about is the state of completion of the action\n\n- \"**Kumakain** ako ng pizza kahapon nang dumating siya.\" = I **was eating** pizza yesterday when she arrived. [the speaker has started but not yet finished eating at a past time, hence *kumakain* here is not present tense]\n- \"**Kakain** dapat ako ng pizza kahapon kung hindi lang sumakit ang ipin ko.\" = I **would have eaten** pizza yesterday if my teeth didn't hurt. [the speaker was contemplating on eating yesterday but the action wasn't started, hence *kakain* here is not future tense]\n- \"Kapag **kumain** kami ng pizza bukas kahit wala ka, magagalit ka ba?\" = If we **were to eat** pizza tomorrow without you, will you get mad? [the act of eating has already been completed in the future, hence *kumain* here is not past tense]\n\nTL;DR: Tense is about when the action happened, aspect is about the state of completion of the action regardless of when it happened.

Maynila might sound better\n\n> \"nagkakaproblema ako [...] Kaya lang\"\n\nThis is a bit confusing. \"Kaya lang\" is along the lines of \"but then, unfortunately\", so the thought after it should be different or contrasting.

Plus, the emphasis of *makapagmiting* is more on the possibility of the action occuring based on circumstance or ability, so it kinda feels like if a meeting does take place, it'll be because of favorable conditions and not because it was deliberately planned. The act of meeting in this case is a social action that is executed both by the speaker and the complainants towards each other. To indicate that social and reciprocal nature, *mag-* verbs become *makipag-* and the other participating party is marked by *sa/kay* -- hence the basic underlying verb *magmiting* becomes *makipagmiting* \n\n> \"a las 0800\"  \n--> \"ng alas otso\" OR  \n--> \"ng 8:00\"\n\nSame reasoning as 6:20\n\n> \"makakauwi tayo sa Y kahit **makakapagtrabaho** ako\"  \n--> \"makakauwi tayo sa Y kahit **magtrabaho** ako\"\n\n\"Kahit\" pairs up a bit differently with each verb aspect:\n\n- With the perfective -- \"even if this action was done in the past/despite this action having already occurred\"\n- With the imperfective -- \"even while this action is currently being done/even though this action happens habitually or recurringly\"\n- With the contemplative -- \"despite the fact that this will happen in the future/even if this action is about to occur\"\n- With the basic form -- \"even if this action is done\"\n\nThe difference might be subtle, but for this case, it's much more natural to use the basic form than the contemplative\n\nAlso, like *makapagmiting*, *makapagtrabaho* emphasizes the possibility of working/being able to work. A simple *magtrabaho* is good enough imo.

The *nagkaroon* aspect is used to state that the *may/meron* condition was a yes in the past but not anymore, while *magkakaroon* states that the *may/meron* condition is currently a no, but will be a yes in the future. *Nagkakaroon*, however, states that something is currently actively in the process of being acquired, which is different from *may/meron* simply stating that someone has something\n\n\"Nagkakasipon/nagkakaroon ng sipon ang bata\" is more of \"The child is getting a cold.\" *May/meron* makes much much more sense to use when describing the current existence/possession of something, so only \"may/merong sipon ang bata\" translates to \"the child has a cold\" (though as noted by /u/roelm2, \"merong sipon\" sounds a bit redundant, but it's not unheard of)\n\n(Slightly unrelated to your question because it's not about possession, but for sickness, you can add the infix *-in-* to say that someone is experiencing that condition, so \"the child has a cold\" can also be translated as \"sinisipon ang bata.\" It's used about as much as \"may sipon\")", "created_utc": "1532411194.0", "edited": "False", "id": "e2xhzpp", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_91ah2c", "parent_id": "t3_91ah2c", "score": "4", "subreddit": "Tagalog", "subreddit_id": "t5_2t8bg"}, {"author": "Couryielle", "body": "I didn't even know there'd be maintenance today ;~; ", "created_utc": "1532406507.0", "edited": "False", "id": "e2xepce", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_91d99a", "parent_id": "t1_e2x7jpz", "score": "1", "subreddit": "SchoolIdolFestival", "subreddit_id": "t5_31rt4"}, {"author": "Couryielle", "body": "You have impeccable taste", "created_utc": "1532374339.0", "edited": "False", "id": "e2whq88", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_9181le", "parent_id": "t1_e2wfsma", "score": "7", "subreddit": "stevenuniverse", "subreddit_id": "t5_2viyl"}, {"author": "Couryielle", "body": "Oh huh, WD as Ragyo has been around forever but Nui as White Pearl never occurred to me \ud83e\udd14", "created_utc": "1532363578.0", "edited": "False", "id": "e2w52lb", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_915ytb", "parent_id": "t3_915ytb", "score": "11", "subreddit": "stevenuniverse", "subreddit_id": "t5_2viyl"}, {"author": "Couryielle", "body": "Maybe it's their giant woman fusion that pilots the giant woman ship", "created_utc": "1532317375.0", "edited": "False", "id": "e2v87vy", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_911mx0", "parent_id": "t1_e2uuljv", "score": "9", "subreddit": "stevenuniverse", "subreddit_id": "t5_2viyl"}, {"author": "Couryielle", "body": "Slightly unrelated but HAH I was right about her gem being the upside down version of Pink's cut, I'm ridiculously glad ;v;", "created_utc": "1532316708.0", "edited": "False", "id": "e2v7oae", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_911mx0", "parent_id": "t1_e2utcu6", "score": "13", "subreddit": "stevenuniverse", "subreddit_id": "t5_2viyl"}, {"author": "Couryielle", "body": "Well I'm fucked for work but ho.

You can be familiar with what all the prepositions mean and correctly guess some prepositional verb meanings but can't really explain why some go together and some don't (e.g. *give up*, *give in*, *give out*, and *give back* all make sense, but *give down* is weird; *up* and *over* are both about being in a higher place but *put up* is acceptable while *put over* is weird, and *take up* and *take over* mean different things). You only know which combinations are more used and acceptable through sheer exposure\n\nLikewise with Tagalog, you can be familiar with what all the verb affixes mean and correctly guess how they affect the verbs, but it's still sheer contextual exposure that can really tell you which combinations are okay and which are weird (e.g. why *-um-* and *mag-* are both actor-focus, but only *maglaba* is acceptable while *lumaba* is weird). But if you can learn prepositional verbs, you *can* learn affix combinations too!\n\nThat said, putting in examples of affix combinations for all the verbs in this list might put me over the post limit and be unnecessarily confusing and complicated, but if you'd like to see the possible affixations for a specific word, feel free to ask me through PM! I love talking about this language :D\n\n(PS: The concept you were referring to with verb affixes is *focus*, not transitivity. There is an explanation for getting the sense of which affixes to use that's more scientific than \"just sheer exposure\" and it's related to the two concepts, but it dives a bit deeper into linguistics territory and I don't know how practically helpful it would be)", "created_utc": "1530600627.0", "edited": "False", "id": "e1pem0v", "is_submitter": "True", "link_id": "t3_8vdqur", "parent_id": "t1_e1nkg0w", "score": "2", "subreddit": "Tagalog", "subreddit_id": "t5_2t8bg"}, {"author": "Couryielle", "body": "They are great words!

Was a bit sick with wisdom teeth woes ~~and the single bombest episode of a show I'm watching just dropped this weekend~~\n\nHmm, this is a bit tough for me to answer since I don't remember how I learned Tagalog in the first place, and I never really paid enough attention in my Filipino classes (since I already understood it anyway) to remember how they went. This is mostly how I might have approached it if I were self-studying Tagalog from scratch so it might not apply to you, it's really just more of a suggestion than a legit guide. Apologies in advance for the wall of text\n\nHaving a good vocabulary base would be really beneficial, especially for words you can immediately use. Nouns and adjectives especially for starters (verbs are a bit more tricky), and also stock greetings and pleasantries, which people say without thinking too much anyway. Just by knowing basic nouns, pronouns, and adjectives (which, compared to verbs, don't change much in a sentence, if at all) you can already make a HECK lot of sentences in the YX \"[(marker+)noun/adjective/pronoun] [marker+noun/pronoun]\" (English \"X is Y\") pattern. Learn the words that are personally relevant or interesting or immediately useful to you (words for everyday household objects should be learned first before like, the names of the months or countries imo, unless you want to ofc) and try to fit them into that sentence pattern, and learn new sentence patterns to express more complex thoughts when you need them (I'm a very informal learner haha). There are a lot of sentence patterns that don't use verbs in Tagalog!\n\n(Edit: I realized while trying to list sentence patterns that you can actually get away ridiculously smoothly with just using English nouns and adjectives in place of their Tagalog equivalents. The pronouns and verb affixes are inescapable though)\n\nThe toughest thing to get used to about verbs, especially if you're not familiar with how SEA languages work, are the verb affixes and what kind of roles they assign to the nouns (aka verb focus). It's one of the biggest grammatical differences between English and Tagalog -- while English relies on word order to tell you who is doing what to whom in a sentence and the subject is almost always the doer of the action, Tagalog relies on verb affixes and markers (ang/ng/sa) to tell you that, and the \"subject\" (I prefer the term \"focus\") has a pretty equal chance of either being the doer or the object of the action, or it could be something else entirely as well. It might seem intimidating at first but it's almost like a fun game when you get the hang of it!\n\nHere is a [good reference](http://www.seasite.niu.edu/tagalog/tagalog_verbs.htm) for Tagalog verbs and the two most common kinds of focus: the actor-focus (which makes the word accompanied by \"ang\" to be the doer of the action) and object-focus (which makes the word accompanied by \"ang\" to be what or whom the being is done to). Once you have (or while you're still acquiring, it's up to you) a good deal of vocabulary words, you can start making \"[verb] [marker+focus] ([marker+non-focus/other details])\" sentences, which would vastly expand how much you can express in Tagalog\n\nI could go more in-depth but this is already so long haha //// just ask me if you need any further clarifications ;v;\n\n**TL;DR**\n\n1. Learn nouns, pronouns, and adjectives. Learn also the three markers (ang/ng/sa), they're very important\n2. Practice those vocab with sentence patterns that don't use verbs\n3. Learn verb roots and at least their actor-focus and object-focus forms\n4. Practice using the verbs with the nouns/pronouns/adjectives you know\n\nAfter this you're pretty much done with beginner level! Of course this is a very general and incomplete guide, so please feel free to go beyond and learn more complex structures as it fits your needs. I mostly learned Japanese by slogging through text that's waaay beyond my comprehension level and piecing the meaning together from 3-5 different translation websites to avoid being bamboozled lol\n\nGeneral resources:\n\n- [SEAsite: Tagalog](http://www.seasite.niu.edu/tagalog/) is a bit old-fashioned and confusing to navigate, but it does offer insight on the finer points of Tagalog grammar\n- [Tagalog Lang](https://www.tagaloglang.com/) (\"Just Tagalog,\" or idk maybe it's simply short for Tagalog language) is like an informal dictionary, but it also shows how to use the vocabulary words in a sentence, so it's pretty helpful.

It's correct but it's super formal, so it sounds a bit out of place in every day conversation. Tbh we don't actually express this sentiment in Tagalog when meeting someone new, so it's really just more of a translation of a common English greeting than an actual greeting in Tagalog itself. In place of \"nice to meet you\" we say \"kumusta?\" (\"how are you?\" which doesn't really require an answer) or just... \"nice to meet you\"\n\nInstead of thinking of Tagalog as a VSO to English's SVO, I think it's more useful to think of Tagalog as a predicate-subject to English's subject-predicate. This is especially important when you consider that Tagalog has no word for the verb \"to be\"\n\nIn a basic Tagalog sentence a predicate can either be a noun, adjective, or verb phrase, and they all fall before the subject. For example:\n\nPrinsesa si Anna.  \n*Anna is a princess.*\n\nIn English, \"Anna\" is the subject and \"is a princess\" is the whole predicate. In Tagalog, the subject is \"si Anna\" (\"si\" is a special word that points to a named noun as the star/focus of the sentence) and the predicate is just \"prinsesa.\" Kinda like Russian, there's no \"to be\" in Tagalog and the word \"a\" is optional, so they're both dropped\n\nAdjective example:\n\nMalaki ang aso.  \n*The dog is big.*\n\nEnglish subject = \"the dog\"  \nTagalog subject = \"ang aso\" (\"ang\" is like \"si\" but for common nouns)  \nEnglish predicate = \"is big\"  \nTagalog predicate = \"malaki\"\n\nVerb example:\n\nLumilipad ang ibon.  \n*The bird flies/is flying.*\n\nEnglish subject = \"the bird\"  \nTagalog subject = \"ang ibon\"  \nEnglish predicate = \"flies\"  \nTagalog predicate = \"lumilipad\"\n\nIf you need any further clarifications, please ask away!

I was struggling to find a way to word it without coming off as a crazy Lapis Lazuli stan who thinks she must be coddled at all times, because I do want her to stop making bad decisions that obviously hurt others and, less obviously to her, herself. \n\nPeople deal with and heal from trauma differently, and her life experiences left her with crippling anxiety that can't be compared to anyone else in the show. This is a personal reason, and feel free to stop reading at this point tbh my thoughts are still all over, but her instinct to run away from the things that cause her anxiety is so painfully relatable that I can't help but root for her and hope she reaches a place where she can face them head on, the way I don't want to lose hope that someday I can too. I'm frustrated with her actions because I know what it's like to be too caught up in your own head to see the bigger picture and unable to make the logical call despite knowing what the logical call is, but at the same time she makes me see how my own anxious thought processes probably look like to others, how I could be hurting others too\n\nAs for everyone being quick to forgive her, she wasn't exactly actively trying to kill anyone out of malice like Peridot was, she was just trying to be left alone and to go home. It wasn't about entitlement, it's about desperately trying to go back to a familiar place after being lost for so, so long. And when she made a mistake and got caught on Homeworld to be led back to Earth, she did try everything in her power to warn them beforehand and keep them (mostly just Steven but still) safe. She was no doubt powerful enough to break away from Jasper's grasp in Jailbreak and leave them all behind at the beach but she didn't, she faced her troubles for the first time in the show because she has someone she wants to protect... and suffered massively for it. Malachite was the opposite of being born out of selfishness, she wanted *nothing* more than to be free and gone from the planet that she was unwillingly imprisoned in for thousands of years and holds nothing but bad memories for her, yet she willingly entrapped herself because she believed it was the better course of action to save Steven. All she ever asked for was her freedom, and she got it back after 5000 very long years, only to give it away again, and after everything, it still didn't work out in the end\n\nNo wonder she'd rather run away than face any kind of trauma again, she has yet to feel truly happy and safe because this whole time she's choking on the possibility of everything going wrong again like last time, even on days when she seems okay. Living on Earth, raising crops and making meep-morps were a distraction and she needed that too, but you really can't just lock yourself away from reality like that forever, and that's the point where we're at now. It's a reality check that got her out of her stagnant \"peace,\" and hopefully, eventually, down the path of true healing\n\nI don't think wanting to finally, *finally* have any semblance of peace of mind for the first time since ~3000 BC make her a chickenshit coward. And while I do want her to be genuinely happy, I don't want her to just overcome thousands of years trauma just because she's found people to truly care about. It's not that easy no matter how hard I wish it were, and I'm glad that it's being shown\n", "created_utc": "1525947985.0", "edited": "False", "id": "dyqxd8i", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_8hzzu2", "parent_id": "t1_dynw2xk", "score": "1", "subreddit": "BeachCity", "subreddit_id": "t5_3c6zb"}, {"author": "Couryielle", "body": "I think it's just the scheduling that makes the townie episodes seem more insufferable to some people.
