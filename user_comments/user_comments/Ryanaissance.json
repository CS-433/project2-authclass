Water (quality water--I personally use reverse osmosis filtration, but just getting enough makes a big difference).\n2. Sleeping position.  I've slept on my face since I was a kid.  Putting tennis balls or whatever around you to keep your face off the pillow and prevent scrunching your skin in your sleep is a big one.  I think not discovering this until recently has made some of them permanent, but the size has gone down since I've changed my habits.\n3. Physical therapy for back pain had the side-benefit of helping me be aware of holding stress in my muscles.  It turns out I've held a lot in my back and shoulders...and a TON in my forehead.  Try softening the muscles in that area more often?\n\nOf course having thin skin in your genes makes this problem an order of magnitude harder to fight.\n\nOther things that are mixed results at best:\n\nGelatin/Collagen (Great Lakes), Red Light Therapy (not infrared), Retinol, Hyaluronic Acid, Vitamin C, Tape, Microneedling, Low-Glycemic Dieting.   Long term use of all of these hasn't made much of a dent! in the problem.  In the short term the first three SEEM like they might have worked when I first started with them, but after this long of use, its clear they're not enough for a significant improvement.  They may be preventing it from getting worse though.\n\nSunscreen.  Noticeable effects are too long term to tell how much this has been helping.

They are the most beautiful languages on the planet that I've heard.\n\nIcelandic:  Ethereal sounding.  Very breathy.\n\nPersian:  Very soft and poetic sounding.\n\nFaroese:  A less ethereal version of Icelandic, but still one of the best.\n\nUkrainian:  The Italian of the Slavic languages.\n\nRussian:  Soulful.\n\nFrench:  Only the French could make gutteral R's and nasal vowels sound pleasant.  Maybe it's conditioning, maybe its inherently superior aesthetics.\n\nEdit:  I saw another comment on why French might sound cultured and Romantic to Americans and I have to agree.  The French influence on the foundations of America certainly make the language and culture more endearing and close to heart.  The large amount of borrowed vocabulary certainly helps as well.  Its like we're hearing a romantic pronunciation of words we already know.\n\nItalian:  The best sounding Romance language, but beauty is not just sonics, so it lists just below French...only just.\n\nPortuguese:  Sounds like Spanish trying to be French, and the result is amazing to hear.\n\nNorwegian:  Cheerful with a hint of Viking just below the surface.\n\nSwedish:  Sing-songy but a bit saccharine.\n\nOccitan\\~Catalan\\~Spanish:  These three sound pretty similar to my ear.

There are many math and science people in the US who speak it natively.  California, and the west coast as a whole, has a surprising number of Russians, so there are decent opportunities to get practice in.  It is uncommon to study yet there is decent demand for Americans who speak it.  It unlocks a huge part of the internet and if you do any gaming you already know how many new people you'll be able to play with.  And of course some of the best literature in the world is in Russian.  \n\nDespite all of those reasons, I wasn't leaning to Russian because the reasons weren't as *personal* as for Irish or Finnish, or even Spanish.

It takes little more than a single editor of a well-known journal to feed desired results to public.  They can, and as a matter of frequent course, do refuse to publish anything that goes against their beliefs, pet theories, or financial or political incentives.  Most scientists do not carefully check others' work.  There isn't time or energy, and most are busy with their own work.  They'll scan for relevant work to cite, rarely carefully deconstructing it in the process.  This is not even to mention the frighteningly large amount of mere incompetence found in published works.  How much time do you spend pouring over technical details of papers?  How would you be aware of work that disagrees if the editor refuses to glance at it and the censorship apparatus keeps as tight a lid on it as they can?  Could you spot errors in a technical analysis?  Could you recognize fake data when the author has an incentive to put a lot of effort into making it look real?\n\nSame with elections.  No judge has dismissed these fraud cases on their merit.  The evidence is overwhelming, and so are the forces who do not want the public to find out.  They work to make sure the public automatically dismisses any such claims.

Since Oregon was my home, perhaps I transferred those feelings to Finnish.  It was years before I learned anything about Finland other than \"some place that's like Oregon\".  Eventually I learned of the connection to Tolkien, as well as how pleasant the language sounded.

When I was in undergrad I didn't know about reddit, but there was Study Hacks on Cal Newport's blog-full of advice on getting more effective studying out of less total time spent.  He also wrote two small books on the topics.  Saved me from failing out.  Now I'm working on a PhD and I've largely internalized all of his advice, but I still peek here from time to time to see if there are even better tips I haven't encountered.\n\nThere and here have all the advice I think anyone could ever need.\n\nOff the top of my head the following is pretty instinctual to me at this point.  Original advice largely from Cal Newport.\n\n1. Regardless of ability, most students in most classes should not have to study to the point where it takes all of your time.\n2. Cramming should never happen.  Start early, study often (daily per class, but just a reasonable amount any given day)\n3. You don't have to read everything.  Learning to study effectively means learning to figure out what you actually need to read or know.  Everything else is a trap (unless you're curious-but only go back to the extra things after you're set with what is required) Like a Jeopardy clue-often only one or two words tell you that the actual question (answer) is different than what is stated.  Its the art of reading between the lines.\n4. For mathy classes its really straightforward:  Learn carefully (not by reading, but by doing) each specific topic the class covers.  Make a list.  Once you understand a concept/formula/problem type, you should be able to reproduce it without looking and explain it to others.  If you can't do that, you haven't learned it yet.  Check off each topic one by one and there isn't much else you have to do.\n5. For mathy classes, homework problems are rarely the algorithmic type you see in high school.  Work on the assignment the day its assigned.  Make sure you understand each question.  Solve the easier ones.  Each day work a little further.  For the hard problems you can't solve, try to think about why they're hard, what specifically is blocking you.  Why what you're trying to do is failing.  Sleep on it and try the next day and the next.  Your subconscious will often work it out, but failing that you'll have time to go to the Prof before the HW is due with actual specific questions he can answer, instead of \"I don't know how to do this problem\" like everyone else does.  Guaranteed you'll get better help from him/her that way if you need it.  Math/Science homework is kind of like tackling debt by paying off small debt first to build momentum.  Pick off the easy ones, and then you'll have more time for the hard ones.\n6. Studying for tests means self-testing.  Make up likely test questions and answer/solve them yourself.  Don't wait until the last minute, do a little bit everyday.  Like 5 minutes after each class or something-test yourself on exactly what you learned, how it fits with everything else, etc  Arrive for exams relaxed and get the easy A.\n7. Essays/Research Papers---Make progress daily from when you first hear about it.  Details depend on the assignment, but typically its brainstorm for topics, then narrowing for good questions/theses, then looking for references and recording as you go, outlining and refining the outline, adding in details to make a draft, having the prof look at it well before others have even started theirs, editing based on prof's suggestions.\n8.

But reality stands hard in the way.\n\nI tried doing a single language for years, and it works.  It can also be boring.  You always want to look at other girls.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNowadays, I've reached a compromise.  I practice between 1-2 hours most days (Cutting out an hour of TV or mindless internet browsing helped).\n\nHalf of that time is my current focus language, which I resolved to stick with no matter what until I feel fairly comfortable in it. The other half is divided among other languages-ones I'm more familiar with and ones I'm not.  I have a lot of languages here, so in this half I prioritize languages I've already become familiar with or ones I'm more interested in learning sooner, outside of my focus language.  This way I gain exposure to each language every day or two, but the investment is minimal.  Some might argue I'm not putting enough time in to make progress, but I'm not finding that to be true.  If I spend 5 minutes going over a dialog several times, and then the next day going over a new dialog, with every few days going back to a previous one, I'm making decent progress for the time invested.  The sounds, rhythms, structures, vocabulary are imprinting on my brain, and the hours are slowly adding up.  When one of those languages eventually becomes a focus, it becomes a relative breeze.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOnce I reach an intermediate level in my focus language, I'm ready to trade it out for another one.  I'm not abandoning it.  If it only gets 10 minutes a day most days, its still fine because I'm at a level I can read fairly quickly or watch a podcast or movie and get most of it.  And I'll still be learning new things most days.  Speaking is the main issue in my plan.  I don't devote that much time to it.  Most of the languages I'm learning don't have anyone near me to speak with, so I have to rely on the internet.  Language exchanges can be very hard to find for some languages.  If you're learning Chinese or French or something big like that, there's lots of opportunities.  Faroese?  Not so much.  I do try to do 1 or two speaking sessions per week, but obviously I can't get every language in.  Instead I'll usually do a couple of months with my focus language when it gets to a point I have enough vocab to speak ( I'm not a fan of speaking from day one).  After that I'll just try and do an exchange or pay for a session in whatever language I feel needs the most work, or that I feel like practicing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm in no hurry to become 'fluent' in any language quickly.  Nothing in my life requires it (though beneficial opportunities arise from time to time). Being interested in so many different languages, but only having the same time as most other people, this is my compromise.  I find it to be more efficient and enjoyable for me than doing one language at a time for 1-3 years and then switching to another.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso, I strategize a little bit with the order of which language I focus on.  For example, if you have a goal of learning Swedish, Danish, and Norwegian then you should start with Norwegian, as it is kind of a middle language and will aid more in learning the other two than starting from either of the other two.  Or if you want to learn Japanese, Chinese, and Korean, then you should start with Japanese.  If you learn Japanese first you have a big advantage when you work on Chinese because of your experience with Kanji, and the structures of Japanese will show up and make your life easier when you do Korean.", "created_utc": "1563651851.0", "edited": "1563652546.0", "id": "eubmse2", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_cfaxq0", "parent_id": "t3_cfaxq0", "score": "2", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "Ryanaissance", "body": "There is no doubt that if you want to learn one language well, as quickly as you can, you should only be studying that language.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTwo languages is doable as well, if you have the time for each.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you're in no hurry and want to learn several or more languages, then I think it is more efficient to learn them in parallel.  For example, if I wanted to learn Danish, Portuguese, Hindi, Maltese, and Scottish, I would take my available daily study time, and put half of it to a single focus one, say Danish.  The other half of the time would be devoted equally to the other four (after I spend a week or so obsessing over each to learn how to read their alphabets and pronounce them in a basic way).  This way I make steady, decent progress in one, until I reach intermediate (where I switch it out with another, say Hindi), while my brain is being exposed to the others a small amount each day.  Even if I can only do a small dialogue in each, the hours add up.
