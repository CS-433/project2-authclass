I started with learning on Duo and got SpanishDict for a dictionary app then found out it also had a learning feature. You type in words on it, so for the first bit I thought it was harder than Duo but after awhile I found it to be easier to learn and more enjoyable \u2014 I think it\u2019s the fast pace nature of it. Start with the 1000 beginner words pack and whenever you\u2019re ready start doing the grammar section alongside it \n\n 2. For listening I use the [Spanish After Hours](https://youtube.com/channel/UCfG2VhlQgy5bHGmkpeKcjVA) YouTube channel. She points to things, has captions, and it\u2019ll reinforce some of the vocab you learn \n\n 3. Some things that have helped me casually from day to day are following Spanish meme accounts on Instagram (they\u2019re for a fandom I\u2019m in so they keep me interested), joining r/ askredditespa\u00f1ol (short questions, short answers), and reading Wattpad fanfics in Spanish (Wattpad fics are generally young amateur written (easier words) and with an iPhone you can hold down on words and click Translate) \n\n 4. Language Transfer app, I haven\u2019t gotten far in it but it\u2019s pretty cool and the videos talk about finding words in Spanish just by knowing English (by using Latin etymology and switching out/adding parts to words (e.g. ly = mente | really = realmente)\n\n5. Bookmark the English to Spanish google translate page on your search browser\n\n 6. Get into the culture! Listen to music in Spanish (listen to a popular playlist, save favorites), watch shows with Hispanic/Latine characters (I got into Spanish because my favorite character in a show spoke one line of Spanish lmao), watch English shows with Spanish subs, and read up on traditions. Passion isn\u2019t essential, but it helps a damn lot\n\n Most importantly, move at your own pace!

Apart from relationships, all you really need from people are a name and pronouns \n\n Reasons I\u2019ve found why others believe in the concept of gender:\n\n\u2022 It\u2019s too culturally ingrained in them\n\n\u2022 They believe sex, expression, pronouns, or qualities are attached to gender \n\n\u2022 They haven\u2019t questioned it\n\n I still think other people are valid in their beliefs regarding gender (as long as they\u2019re respectful to other\u2019s identities on top of that belief) and that assumed respect is important; the best way to put it is that it\u2019s like being a gender atheist \u2014 other people have their viewpoint and mine doesn\u2019t make their\u2019s less valid, I just view them through my lens (you already know all this \u2014 I\u2019m just rambling).\n\n It\u2019s actually pretty freeing not having a think about my gender, and knowing that I\u2019ll probably never have to again", "created_utc": "1643148560.0", "edited": "1643150452.0", "id": "hu7n5wj", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_sc7gmn", "parent_id": "t3_sc7gmn", "score": "10", "subreddit": "agender", "subreddit_id": "t5_2ugup"}, {"author": "itgetsokay", "body": "I wouldn\u2019t really make any connection unless you said it the other way around, then I\u2019d think of the song California Girls \u2014 (17 y/o)", "created_utc": "1643138318.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hu6w2er", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_scju5e", "parent_id": "t3_scju5e", "score": "0", "subreddit": "namenerds", "subreddit_id": "t5_2xmrc"}, {"author": "itgetsokay", "body": "I know the stress is different (I\u2019m guessing) but Opie makes me think of OP (like original poster)", "created_utc": "1643128386.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hu65bt0", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_sbq0pt", "parent_id": "t3_sbq0pt", "score": "1", "subreddit": "namenerds", "subreddit_id": "t5_2xmrc"}, {"author": "itgetsokay", "body": "Spanish and Mandarin.\n\n If I\u2019m getting extra attention put on learning a language might as well go big with mandarin.

This not activating can have two causes:\n\n1. The original movement of creating the glyph can\u2019t set it off \n\n2. The glyph can only be set off by direct touch \n\n>would the spell activate as you applied ink to the stamp since you\u2019d be holding it?\n\n Let\u2019s assume case no. 2 isn\u2019t true. Since you\u2019ve already made the glyph when you made the stamper this one could work, but it makes me wonder about the sensitivity of the glyphs. If Luz were to have a glyph in her pocket, and it touches the side of her pocket, since it has indirect contact with her wouldn\u2019t this make it go off?\n\n Another thought: If the glyph goes off with indirect contact, would even just picking up the stamper set it off? So you could have like, a glyph gun (this is the reality I\u2019m choosing to believe)\n\n Edit: okay but wouldn\u2019t the glyph gun only go off once until pressure is reapplied? So Luz could toss the stamper from hand to hand really fast to have a glyph machine gun\n\nEdit 2: (actually it would probably just be obliterated after using the glyph once lmao)\n\nEdit 3: But if you were to make the end super thick could you get more than one usage out of it? Or would it just be one glyph 20x as powerful?\n\nEdit 4: ACTUALLY don\u2019t you have to imagine what you want the glyph to come out like in your brain? So you could just imagine a small fireball and the thicker stamp wouldn\u2019t effect it how it comes out (make it bigger). But then why is using a smaller fireball necessary? And would it still destroy it though?", "created_utc": "1629943694.0", "edited": "1629944911.0", "id": "hadgmi8", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_pbnlu1", "parent_id": "t3_pbnlu1", "score": "2", "subreddit": "TheOwlHouse", "subreddit_id": "t5_g53v4"}, {"author": "itgetsokay", "body": "I\u2019m between Amber and Zoey", "created_utc": "1629942134.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hadd59j", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_pbo4s5", "parent_id": "t3_pbo4s5", "score": "1", "subreddit": "TheOwlHouse", "subreddit_id": "t5_g53v4"}, {"author": "itgetsokay", "body": "King>>>", "created_utc": "1629941980.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hadct3i", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_pbozsq", "parent_id": "t3_pbozsq", "score": "7", "subreddit": "TheOwlHouse", "subreddit_id": "t5_g53v4"}, {"author": "itgetsokay", "body": "Haven\u2019t read it \n\nSure!", "created_utc": "1629919670.0", "edited": "False", "id": "habwz5t", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_p3ueit", "parent_id": "t1_ha84z4l", "score": "2", "subreddit": "teenagers", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjli"}, {"author": "itgetsokay", "body": "Eliza, Libby, Liza, Betty, Izzy, Elsie are my favorites", "created_utc": "1629868207.0", "edited": "1629868881.0", "id": "ha9acsi", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_palucx", "parent_id": "t3_palucx", "score": "1", "subreddit": "namenerds", "subreddit_id": "t5_2xmrc"}, {"author": "itgetsokay", "body": "Maybe he\u2019s his uncle, so he doesn\u2019t care all that much to meet King but still wants to help his lil nephew out and can lead him to his dad if he wants to meet him (or maybe he doesn\u2019t know where his brother (King\u2019s dad) is either and wants King to help him, hoping that he has information)", "created_utc": "1629783293.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ha4nnlo", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_pa89kx", "parent_id": "t1_ha4ituj", "score": "10", "subreddit": "TheOwlHouse", "subreddit_id": "t5_g53v4"}, {"author": "itgetsokay", "body": "An artist \n\n21.

If you feel like you orgasm too early I would recommend edging. Alternatively you could try out having multiple orgasms; after one wait a while for the sensitivity to go away and try again. If it doesn\u2019t work out for you that\u2019s perfectly fine. \n\n From what I\u2019ve read it isn\u2019t a bad thing, but if you get into a relationship where your partner wants you to keep going after you orgasm so they can also finish, don\u2019t feel pressured to or like you \u201cowe them\u201d (unless you\u2019re fine to keep going). Find someone that you\u2019re comfortable talking with so you can work out how to have sex that\u2019s satisfying to both of you.\n\n If you\u2019re happy having minute orgasms and only like having one, that\u2019s completely valid and don\u2019t feel like you have to \u201cfix\u201d anything.

This paragraph will go over the first part. Functions starting with S/N are known as Perceiving functions, either S/N will be your second letter (e.g. iNfp, iStj) . The functions starting with T/F are known as Judging functions, one will go as your third letter (e.g. inFp, isTj). In the cognitive functions every type these will alternate a certain way, either JPPJ or PJJP (e.g. INFP is F/N/S/T or JPPJ).\n\n The second part is attitudes, which will be either introverted or extroverted, every cognitive function has an attitude and will end with either e or i. These also go in a certain order, either IEIE or EIEI (e.g. INFP is Fi/Ne/Si/Te or IEIE) \n\n[Here](https://imgur.com/gallery/0DmNaGj) are the descriptions for each cognitive function. And [here](https://imgur.com/gallery/KqqSiro) is every cognitive functions order for each type. \n\n Another way to lay out your functions to make it easier would be: \n\n34: Ni\n\n32: Se Fe Fi \n\n30: Si Ne \n\n29: Ti \n\n20: Te \n\n In this test your type is based on your cognitive functions going in order, it went with INFP because Fi has 32 making it the highest, Ne and Si go next, followed by Te at the end. You\u2019re INFP also because with other types all your functions wouldn\u2019t go in order, you can still check out types with Ni dom (dominate, the first function, types with this are INFJ & INTJ) your functions percentage also work with ESFJ. \n\n Let me know if you have any questions, I\u2019ll be happy to answer :)", "created_utc": "1585708008.0", "edited": "1585708327.0", "id": "fm2xwct", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_fsp2km", "parent_id": "t3_fsp2km", "score": "3", "subreddit": "MbtiTypeMe", "subreddit_id": "t5_m1ah5"}, {"author": "itgetsokay", "body": "Magic, you just need a deck of cards and YouTube tutorials.", "created_utc": "1585625426.0", "edited": "False", "id": "flzjud6", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_fs56v9", "parent_id": "t3_fs56v9", "score": "1", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i"}, {"author": "itgetsokay", "body": "6w5 628/629?\n\nFirst paragraph is 6, second is 6/8/9, third is 2, and fourth is 5.", "created_utc": "1585578870.0", "edited": "1585579547.0", "id": "flxae8e", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_frrn2w", "parent_id": "t3_frrn2w", "score": "2", "subreddit": "Enneagram", "subreddit_id": "t5_2sdjj"}, {"author": "itgetsokay", "body": "Oddly I think Bryant and Patrick go better together, they\u2019re both strong names that both mean noble.
