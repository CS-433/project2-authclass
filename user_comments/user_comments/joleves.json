You'll see fire come out the back of your kart, as long as you don't brake, hit something, get hit or run out of reserves you'll maintain the fire and can drive much faster. So once you get it keep boosting. Learning to hold the fire for a full lap on crash cove or coco park is a good place to start if you can't do that already. \n\nFor the sharp braking I press down (on the d-pad) and the direction I want to turn, then let go of accelerate (X) and press brake (square). I usually do this in the air. So jump before hand and then before you hit the ground let go of brake, then let go of down and start accelerating again. You can practice this anywhere. \n\nI was the same btw, on some tracks I couldn't even unlock N trophy when I first played.

But I already recorded myself messing around with the jump (it just took a while to cut and upload the video) so I thought I'd share it anyway. \n\nTo clear a few misconceptions from other comments first. \n\n1. You do not need to have any fire or boost to hit the shortcut. [Here's me hitting it with no fire at all](https://imgur.com/a/AsnSwRf). So no need to worry holding fire just for the shortcut. But holding fire is more important in beating oxide than hitting the shortcut. \n\n2. You do not need to jump from the center / middle of the shortcut. You can jump high enough from any part of the half-pipe. [Here's me jumping to the shortcut from the wrong side twice in a row](https://imgur.com/a/0gWYFlJ). There is nothing special about where you aim to jump from. Just take a good, safe line. \n\nI think getting it consistently comes down to 2 things. \n\n1. Timing your jump. This is the most important part imo. [I tried to hit the edge of the half-pipe at a similar angle to you and could make it](https://imgur.com/a/l6X9tjj). Although it's more difficult / less consistent but it shows how important the timing is.   \n\n2. It's easier if you're more perpendicular to the rim you're going to jump off. You can get away with being at an angle, but it makes it a bit more awkward and after a certain angle it just isn't possible. [This is more how I would usually hit it](https://imgur.com/a/tcFMmE0). \n\nI agree that it is poorly coded. There's quite often times where I'll get the height but get stuck hovering at the top of the shortcut before being kicked back down which is really frustrating. \n\nAlso the rim of the half pipe is just glitchy in generally. After the first barrel I stay to the right and cut that corner, I'll often randomly lose my reserves going over the lip of the half-pipe. \n\nThere are a lot of shortcuts like this in the game. Blizzard bluff fence jump, the jump from the minecart shortcut back onto the track in dragon mines and the first 2 possible shortcuts in polar pass all come to mind. They're really all about timing the jump and your line, of course fire helps. \n\nAnd it's too late for you now, but you can beat Oxide on this track without ever taking the shortcut.

Especially because people are giving you solutions when they don't even know what the problem is or even where it is, I'm actually shocked at these comments. \n\nI've worked with a good physio who would always say there are 2 types of muscle knots. Those that come and go frequently (i.e. you sit awkwardly for a few hours and the knot goes away after a day or two) or persistent knots. \n\nThe first isn't anything to really worry about, they happen and go away. Just watch not to stay in a compromised position frequently and for long periods of time. \n\nThe other type of knots, I guess what people would call chronic, require a different approach. Looking at movement patterns and making sure that there isn't anything preventing that muscle from moving through a healthy range of motion. After that strength training is key. Stretching is good too, but my physio worked me down to like an 80:20 ratio of strength to stretch work.\n\nI like deadlifts, but please don't go and do them without first fixing any issues you have and without proper coaching (unless you actually know what you're doing). There are many top athletes that never do this exercise for a reason. You can get the same benefits through many other safer exercises. \n\nLastly diagnosing your problem properly will obviously help. Back knots could be in many places, the erector spinae, trapezius (lower, middle or upper region) rhomboids, lats etc. The fact people are recommending deadlifts as a solution without even knowing where your back pain is is mindboggling. \n\nIf you're not sure about trying any exercises out at the gym there are many you can do at home. Potential exercises could include any of the following depending on your weakness: Erectors can be strengthened by exercises like [these](https://youtu.be/JdJ2oH1Ef_I), reverse hypers, roman chair extensions, or by laying on the floor and using these muscles to lift you chest (and later legs) off the floor. People recommend the Y T I W exercises for people with upper / mid back weakness, reverse fly's and shrugs (very slow and controlled btw). Rows etc are great too. \n\nBut honestly, if you have ongoing issues you're far better off going to a physio who knows what they're talking about and can properly assess your pain and make sure there isn't anything more serious wrong.

Now that I've built up some strength I stretch after strengthening them sometimes. \n\nFor neck strengthening [here's a good video](https://youtu.be/gimeRpdqWQw). You can do a good few with body weight or bands, I personally like using weights but body weight is great too. You can target SCM as well if you want. Just lay down, rotate your body slightly to one side and slowly lengthen the muscle by moving your head and then contract it again to bring the head up.

Some days lower weight, higher reps (like 20). Other days higher weight lower rep range (8-12). For mid / lower traps the i y t exercises.

Awful fatigue for about 3 months, it has improved. \n\nI had this feeling like my brain was spinning. My GP thought it was vertigo. It was intense and by far the worst part of this illness for me. During the worst time I couldn't even shake my head to say no it just hurt so bad. I was so sensitive to movement too, sitting in the car made me feel faint / short of breath / heart palpitations. This lasted like 8-10 weeks roughly. I can mostly shake my head again, it's still somewhat sensitive. I have felt okay in the car doing some very short journeys lately but haven't gone far or fast.

At the start studying was impossible, literally in one ear out the other. \n\nI had a bad taste in my mouth / bad breath, mostly gone, it was constant and bad.

Ultrasound of my heart which the cardiologist said was healthy, just a blocked branch which he said he was happy to leave. They also had me do twice daily blood pressure readings for a week and wear a 24hr heart monitor. \n\nMedication: \nThe GP originally gave me a motion sickness tablet. It made me feel much better when moving, but just seemed to be relieving the symptoms not fixing the issue. I took these for 2 weeks and stopped because they can slow the healing of the balance system. The doctor then gave me an anti-histamine. She originally diagnosed me with viral labyrinthitis and vertigo, that's why she gave those medicines. I had symptoms of those things, but that diagnosis doesn't really explain the breathlessness etc. \n\nOther things I've done:\nMultivitamin - noticed no difference but I take those anyway. \nCod liver oil. \nMagnesium glycinate and\nCO10 - started at the same time, I definitely think they helped (or one of them did anyway).\nQuercetin - don't think I noticed a difference, but I've only been taking it like every other day. \nI've also been taking ibuprofen, usually for a few days in a row and then I take a break. And omeprazole recently. \nSome probiotics. \n\nI think my diet was relatively healthy, I cut out certain things like caffeine and dairy to see if I noticed any improvement. Tried to eat foods with more antioxidants; blueberries, grapes, cranberries etc and healthy fats; olive oil, sunflower seeds etc. \n\nIt's hard to tell which things have helped the most. Probably time, the booster and magnesium glycinate/ CO10 for me. \n\nWhat kind of magnesium did you take? I've read that oxide is the worst at being absorbed by the body but it's cheap and seems to be the most common in supplements. So citrate or glycinate are better, I ended up choosing glycinate as I read it was better against brain inflammation.

I personally find reading to be the easiest skill. You mentioned having good speaking and listening skills. If a native speaker was to say something to you and then you read that exact same piece of text, which would you understand more of? \n\nI guess what I'm trying to get at is what you think is preventing you from understanding something? The grammar can be very complex in advanced pieces of Hungarian I think, it is difficult. It also has a very rich vocabulary with very little overlap with English. Both of which means a lot of time / practice for you (and me). \n\nLike if I were to give you a random article [like this blog post](https://angol-nyelv-tanulas.blog.hu/2022/01/03/okos_celmeghatarozas?dashboard_position=299497858) and you had to underline everything you didn't fully understand would that be because of vocab, grammar, sentence structure or something else? \n\nIn my experience if you've been doing a somewhat equal amount of listening and reading since you started, it's more of an illusion that you think your listening is better than your reading. Because at the end of the day listening is you being able to parse what the person says and understand it, reading is just understanding it. It might just be that the content you're reading is just harder. \n\nI haven't read the anna gimi one so I can't say much about it, but a book like animal farm is difficult, it was written quite a while ago, uses more dated vocabulary and overall it's not a simple book. Neither is something like Harry potter, I've only read it in Hungarian but it's harder than people give it credit for. Don't be hard on yourself if you can't understand everything in a complex piece of work after only 2 years.  \n\nThe best thing to do is just continue to consume a lot of material I think. How many full books have you read? Maybe just pick one you already know well and go for it. It's up to you if you want to read intensively (and look up a lot of unknowns) or extensively, or do a mix, or maybe you'd find the listening-reading method fun / useful? \n\nBtw B2+ in Hungarian in 2 years is really impressive imo!\n\nEdit: I just saw your comment about not understanding texting either.

It was definitely like a sink or swim feeling, but the lack of graded material and the boringness of kids content forced me. \n\nI found 2 books for young teens in Hungarian (az \u00fajonc by Robert Muchamore and a szellem \u00e1tka by Joseph Delaney), don't get me wrong they are not easy reads by any means, but I must have read both about 5 times in English when I was a kid. Even though they might be a bit lame for adults, reading an old book I once loved was enough motivation to push me through it and I knew the story well so that kind of made a very hard book a little bit easier. So if there's a book you loved as a kid and know well I'd recommend finding a translation. Easier books like diary of a wimpy kid or the little prince might suit more in terms of difficulty, but you might not enjoy them as much.\n\nMost books will be really hard tbh, if you do take the jump to harder content here's some advice:\n\n- the majority of unknown words will be in the first 3rd of the book, if you make it through that you'll see a lot more repeating vocab. So keep at it! \n\n- if you read multiple books in a series or multiple books about the same topic you can make a hard book slightly more comprehensible because you'll get some overlap in vocab. \n\n- you could read something like TED talks. They have transcripts in many languages, they're usually fairly short and are about a specific topic. So you could choose to read a number of talks about 1 topic, consult the script in your native language if you're really stuck, and then move onto another topic when you want to. Plus the language used isn't as literary as in novels. \n\n- comics might be worth a go? If that's something you're into\n\n- blogs might be good too. A bit limited in Hungarian but if you find one you like they're also usually about specific topics. \n\nThe podcast Hungarian with Sziszi is really good btw if you aren't familiar with it.
