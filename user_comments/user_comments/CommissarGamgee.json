You seem to be going down the more utilitarian route and only that route which is quite dangerous.  \n\nLet me preface by saying that I have grown up my entire life with a very close friend who has downs syndrome. He can't really speak (he can say certain words like \"curry\" ehic is his favourite food) but he's still conscious and can make decisions for himself and he's one if the most lovable people.  His mother was given the choice to have an abortion but she decided against it and anyone who knows him is glad that she didn't.  He is amazing and has an amazing and full life with loads of friends and support. I absolutely adore him with every ounce of my being. \n\nHowever, on the other hand, my cousin had a child and he was born (as much as I hate to say this phrase) brain dead.  He was completely immobile and was just about able to breathe (I'm not exaggerating).  They had to carry him everywhere, take him to the bathroom and spoon feed him right up until his passing aged 22.  What sort of life was that for him?  I personally would hesitate to call it a life but more of simply an existence.  \n\nI know its unbelievably hard for a parent to make the decision whether to let their child go and I hope I am never in that position.  To me though, it's quite selfish.\n\nAnother example is that of the poor child Alfie Evans who was the centre of a major debate a few years ago. He was born in a semi-vegetative state and had a neurological condition.  He couldn't hear, see, smell or respond to touch.  The parents tried everything to help him but nothing could be done.  In stead of making the decision to let him go,  they wanted to keep him on life support (from what I remember he wouldve needed ventilation pretty much all his life).  They went to the courts and after long deliberation the courts ruled in favour of taking his life support off.  Its a gut wrenching decision but I think it was the right one.", "created_utc": "1627579211.0", "edited": "1627579661.0", "id": "h6z8p86", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_otta0n", "parent_id": "t3_otta0n", "score": "2", "subreddit": "unpopularopinion", "subreddit_id": "t5_2tk0s"}, {"author": "CommissarGamgee", "body": "Not disrespectful, more complete and utter ignorance.
