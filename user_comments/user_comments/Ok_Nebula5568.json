As someone who has ADHD as well and had to face plenty of hurdles as a result, but still managed to graduate in the top 2 percent of her class and get in and attend an amazing college to hopefully end up pursuing civil engineering, I fully believe in you! And your health should absolutely take priority over your education, so don't feel bad or let anyone make you feel bad for prioritizing it. \n\nAnd I am rooting for you for college applications! I remember college applications being stressful (I did apply to a bunch of schools, so maybe I brought that up on myself? But I digress.), so be kind and gracious to yourself and your peers as y'all go about this. Rejections might happen for you and your peers, and please know that that doesn't mean you're not good enough- you absolutely are. \n\nAnd as someone who was virtual their entire senior year thanks to COVID, have fun your senior year! It's not all about grades and college acceptances- feel free to relax and make some memories! But still, make good choices!

If A&M is indeed adding the Common App, I'd say just use that. As for recommendations, when I applied, I didn't submit any.  Generally if you use Common App, you can submit the recommendation letters in one full swoop with everything else, which was really convenient for me. I also think if y'all wait until late August, that should be totally fine. I didn't start working on my application to A&M until September 2020 and was able to get mine in by the deadline, so I think y'all should probably be fine.
