What you are asking and 2. What you want them to do about it/explain.\n\n- You are probably getting some study periods due to VSV, but I strongly recommend you just timetable these as 'politics' instead. It can start to feel very unstructured quite quickly, and with VSV the last thing you want to do is become disorganised\n\n- Keep up to date with your work. It's really easy to fall behind in vsv because obviously there's no teacher chasing you up for your work, helping you through the worksheet, physically going through the slides, etc. This is why keeping those study periods as politics 'classes' will really help.\n\n- Make a groupchat! I did it this year, I just put my Instagram handle in the chat and asked people to follow me. Technically it wasn't allowed, but I did it anyway and did not get in trouble ;)) Would highly recommend because it's super helpful to be able to discuss any class work in, especially because the teachers are hit or miss. \n\nHonestly, it's really similar to online learning! If there was anything that worked for you back then definitely utilise it next year.\n\nEnjoy it!

My previous points all stand, you can do it, you will get through it. Build up experience and knowledge, take any opportunity which comes your way. Internships are great, many will be unpaid though. Again, perhaps centerlink will be necessary. Maybe you move back home, live with roommates, etc. Dont feel ashamed of this. You are investing in yourself, in your career, and in your future. There is NO shame in moving back home, you are on your own timeline. I know everyone wants  good job with a good income, but maths and science inclined people are not the only ones with money!\n\nAlso, if you ever do change career paths later in life (like the nurse), dont ever get caught in wishful thinking. Never think \"if only I did this sooner\", because you didnt. There is no use in wondering what could have been, because it takes away from the now. When your 82, sitting in a rocking chair and reflecting on your life you probably will not be thinking \"I wish I started a trade at 16 instead of 32\", instead you will be thinking (hopefully) \"I'm glad I figured out what I was passionate in and pursued it. I am richer for the experiences I have lived.\"\n\nMaybe uni will be hard. Perhaps it'll be scary to make friends, maybe you'll struggle in the beginning. So what? Why let that stop you? Why let fear keep you from everything you want? Wear shorts in the summer, join that uni club, go to the dance class. Join the book club, offer to bake a cake for the bake sale, go to the fete. Tear it up at the club, talk to somebody you'll never see again. Know that fear and confidence can coexist. Being yourself is one of the most vulnerable things one can do but its also one of the most rewarding. There is someone out there for you, not just relationship wise, but friendship wise. You will meet your people. Maybe not now, maybe not for a long time. I hope you find them soon, but again life is unexpected. My mum is still forming close friendships at the age of life... 48! \n\nWhat to take away from this: your fears arent completely unfounded. They are rooted in the ides that life is unpredictable and scary, which is true! You are scared of the bad times, which will happen, and thus you would rather stay in your little safe bubble. I understand, I relate, however we have to straighten our spines and lift our heads. Life is coming, we have to accept what might happen and the things we may face, then we need to accept that whatever we think our life may look like will be interrupted by SO many curveballs. My mum thought she was going to be a ballerina at the Royal Ballet, instead shes a single mother to three girls in Australia \ud83e\udee3 Just because her old dreams didnt come true does not mean she is any less happy. Would you believe it if I said shes happier now than she was in her youth?\n\nAlso, go get good at maths. Dont do it because you think its your only path to a good life though, it isnt. Do it for the same reasons I want to learn to surf, go rock climbing, teach Englisn overseas, learn Spanish and French: because you can. Because life is only as rich and enjoyabke as you make it. Because the internet is a wealth of resources. Because there sre no limits to your potential. Because when your 82 and on the rocking chair it will have felt so good to know that you conquered maths.\n\nI hope this advice helps in someway, even though I am only 17 and know jack sh*t about life as well \ud83e\udef6", "created_utc": "1658834846.0", "edited": "1658835147.0", "id": "ihp9uvc", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_w8ey9a", "parent_id": "t1_ihp9tq5", "score": "2", "subreddit": "vce", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rpm4"}, {"author": "Misheard_", "body": "I dont want this to sound cliche, but you are 100% not alone. Currently I have been feeling the exact same way, I have an end goal in site (humanitarian aid, would love to work in the field for UN, UNICEF, IRHC, you know the drill) but no idea about the short term stuff like what to specialise in, etc. I just feel as though its easier to just remain where I am in life - secondary school student with no need to think about the future. However, you and me are kinda out of luck because the future doesnt stop for no one. \n\nLets also try and put it into perspective, school only 13 years of our life. Yes its signifcant, yes it shapes us, but no it does not define us. It does not make up the rest of our lives. Adulthood will be hard, enlightening, volatile, exciting, dynamic, rewarding. It is the longest stage of our lives, we might as well look forward to the experiences we will have, the memories we will make, and the lessons we will learn. No it wont always be easy, surely you've witnessed your parents go through/or have heard about some tough times in their lives. Hopefully you have witnessed them get to a better stage in their lives, tougher and more resilient. We will inevitably go through hard times, I understand that thats scary. It makes me want to hold on tight to my mums hand and never let go. However, we know that these times are just a necessity of life. They will not last forever. We cannot have some of our happiest moments without some of our harshest. \n\nGoing back to the workforce, uncertainty can make everything feel so frightening. However trust me when I say I dont think ANYONES got it figured it out completely. Some of my teachers, well into their middle ages (sorry) have even said they havent quite figured out what they want to be. That's because we grow and change forever. Our heights may be fixed, our brains may have developed, but we never stop exploring who we are and what makes us tick. Perhaps we will forever be chasing out what sets our hearts on fire, perhaps it will come to us in a dream on our 25th birthday. My point is, when we accept this the burden of the future feels a lot less heavy. Nothing is permanent, people change careers all the time! I met a nurse who had only started nursing in her 40s. Its easy to let society and what other people have to say about your career goals affect you, but in the end its YOUR life! You cant spend it trying to please others. \n\nNow in regards to supporting yourself, maybe it will be difficult to find a good, wellpaying job straight out of uni. Maybe it will take years, maybe you'll be taking crappy jobs completely unrelated to your interests or which have you working minimum wage. Is this the end of the world? I dont think so. We have our whole lives ahead of us, our whole lives to grow and expand on our careers. Maybe those crappy jobs will end up becoming the necessary experience to land your dream job. Maybe they gave you awesome skills which look killer on your resume. Or perhaps they stay crappy jobs, perhaps they will just always represent a time in your life where you were unsure and struggling. Again, this isnt the end of the world! My advice is to keep doing SOMETHING you love, then life wont feel so difficult. So maybe breaking out into the humanitarian sector is pretty difficult and I end up working some low-wage job at a bakery in rural Victoria. Okay... that doesnt sound too great to me, its nothing that I want to do. But, instead of moping I make the most of it. I learn how to communicate with customers, I go to work every day and relish in the smell of baked goods. I get involved with the community, I get a library card, I drive down to the beach whenever I can to practise surfing. A time in my life where I could have been really down on myself I instead turned into a point in my life which I would look back fondly on. I know I put a really rosy tint on that, there can (and probably will be) much more difficult times in our lives. We struggle to pay the rent, feel hopeless, go through long periods of unemployment, etc. My point is, find something, anything to keep you going. You will be okay. If theres a point in your life where you have to rely on centrelink payments, know that you have not failed.

The pomodoro technique is designed for those that cant focus/find it counterproductive to study for long periods of time without any breaks. Perhaps you need to start with an even lower intensity level, 15 minutes of study and a 1 minute break. \n\nWhen I get ready for a 'study session' (i say that loosely because alot of my study is just prescribed homework, like chapter questions or practise exam questions) I like to fill out a study planner. Don't just write \"complete biology questions\", make it a specific goal which can reasonably be accomplished. \"Finish drafting my English plan within these 25 minutes\" or something like that. I find the more specific I am with what I want to accomplish the more likely it is that I will.\n\nFlashcards are great. I use them for all of my subjects, and not just for definitions. My HHD Anki looks like this: \"How can poverty and education affect health?\", on the opposite side I have my answer.

For me, movement is important. Im always stretching, standing, bending and adjusting when im studying.

Explaining it in a very clear and concise way not only helps it stick in my head, but also gives a very clear outline and path for my brain to follow. think of it like French really, you dont just learn the noun you learn the noun + its gender right? so never just learn a quote but learn the quote + how its significant/blah blah\n\nAVOID:\nretelling the story \ud83d\ude35\u200d\ud83d\udcab everyone likes to think they dont do this, but trust me everyone has fallen into that trap once or twice. you dont need to explain a quote by giving it a whole backstory on the precise scene and what the characters were doing at the time. BORING. your essay is not a film review, its an analysis. remember that your teacher has read this text, whoever reads this essay WILL have read this text. if you a retelling a scene it must serve some purpose, either you are embedding quotes or you are adding something to the scene (bringing up a new idea, pointing out something in the scene, etc) I'll try to give an example:\n\n\"When Anna finally saw Elsa face to face in the castle, she tried to convince her to come back to Arendelle. [explanation]\" NO, horrific. \u274c\u274c\u274c\n\n\"When Anna pled with Elsa to return home, [explanation] [embed a quote of her 'convincing Elsa]\" MUCH BETTER! \u2705\u2705\nIf you already know how to avoid this, then keep it up!\n\nI dont take any of your other subjects so I dont have any other specific advice, sorry! \nHeres some general ones though:\n\nspaced reppition repition um dont know why it doesnt look right you know what i mean (anki would be esp good for bio, chem, probs psych too. Its basically quizlet but better) \n\nretrospective revision time tables (watch ali abdaals video on this)\nto do lists, very helpful\n\nstudy blocks, i do 30m work 5m break keeps me productive\n\nif you can, prestudying may be helpful\n\nknow how you learn/what you need to learn productively! VERY IMPORTANT. For eg, I cant read massive slabs from a textbook so I use speechify to read it to me as I follow along with my eyes. Movement is really crucial for me, during my 5m breaks I will roll out my yoga mat and do some stretching/light exercise/rolling around.

If you feel that these would be beneficial to you, definitely make use of them!\n\nFor me, I found a change of mindset helped. This isnt an instant thing though, its a concious effort for me to change the way im thinking. I think it sort of got claimed by those 'inspirational' tiktok accounts, but I personally really like this mantra: \"I know who I am, I love who I am, I like what I do and I like how I do it. I like my mistakes, I like the way I learn, and I like the pace with which I learn from those mistakes.\" \nI dont know... it just really works for me. It reminds me that learning is a constant journey, bumps along the road are normal and I have the resilience to deal with them and grow from them. When I find myself stressing over scores I take a step back, and calm my fears. \n\nThere is this good tactic, draw a circle and divide it into fours. Write down a feeling that you are currently experiencing (i.e, stress, fear, anxiety, nervous, doubt). If you like you can unpack those \"I feel stressed because im worried that my efforts are not enough\", but dont really spend too much time on this. Then draw another circle divided into fours, write down how you WANT to feel (my go tos are calm, capable, confident, and competent), and unpack those more \"I am calm because I know that I have the support to make it through any curveballs in my life\", \"I am confident because I have put in alot of effort into my studies.\"\n\nObviously I do not have everything figured out, I also deal with anxiety over my final scores...

Then you need to make a judgement on why the program is effective or ineffective, for example: 'This program lacks the input of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, meaning that it may not be culturally appropriate and may not be able to encourage participation in the program.' There are multiple ways to judge whether a program is effective you can really do anything! It could be health improvements as a result, Ottawa Charter action areas have been addressed, etc etc. \n\nHere is an example from the textbook:\n\nFor health this could look like 'Evaluate the capacity of the Aboriginal Driving Stories program to improve Indigenous Health and Wellbeing.'\n\nThe demonstrated answer - \nThis program addresses a signi\ufb01cant need among Indigenous Australians who experience signi\ufb01cantly higher rates of road trauma compared to other Australians. The program worked to develop personal skills among young Aboriginal people that can then be passed on to Elders. These skills can be passed from generation to generation in the future and decrease the risk of injuries among Indigenous Australians, promoting physical health and wellbeing. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people were included in the development of the program. This enhances its cultural appropriateness, and this may increase the participation rate among Indigenous Australians and the chance of promoting their health and wellbeing.\n\nLets break down this answer, firstly there is a link to a significant need/health issue amongst the Indigenous population which needs to be addressed. Then it has considered 3 different ways this program is effective: it has included education, how education can improve health and wellbeing outcomes, and then lastly the cultural appropriateness of the program. \n\nThe textbook key skill areas are sooo helpful!

Five weeks into the first term I had a super bad crash and was feeling super overwhelmed, here are the things I did to help me screw my head on straight:\n- To do lists. A very obvious one, but seriously never doubt a good to do list. At some point in the day (either when I wake up or before I go to bed) I will spend 5 minutes writing out a to-do list. This includes school things + day to day things. Here is what my to-do list looks like today (Monday)\nComplete 2 sections of my creative writing draft, Translate my German report, Give my dog a bath, Read a German short story, HHD edrolo\n\nIt helps for me to keep these tasks specific, 'German homework' doesnt help me at all! I need something concrete which I can tick off. When making my list I'll mentally cycle through all my classes and assess whether theres anything I need to do.\n\n- Calender. Another basic one, but I love the google calender app. I keep assignments, tasks, and homework in there but I also use this to note down spaced repetition sessions (i.e, on Mon I learnt about the prohibition era in History, on Thu I will go over those notes and some form of revision). Helps me keep on top of things.\n\n- Goals. I set goals all the time! Short ones and big ones. They help me stay focused and also make me feel productive and proud of what I did. For each study session I will have a goal, for example 'In this 50 minute period I want to have completed 5.6 and 5.7 chapter questions'.\n\nNow for all those 3 things I use Notion, its an app which basically keeps all of these things in the same place.

For example, Frankie was once an unpopular name in Australia perhaps 15 years ago so parents would have picked it looking for an unusual choice. 15 years in the future it's now an incredibly popular choice! I think it's in the top 15 now.\n\nAnyway, that's just my opinion. If popularity is important to you then I'll definitely consider it in my response. \n\nOkay, so Enzo.
