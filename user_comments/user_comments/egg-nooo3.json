break from running entirely for 2-3 weeks, either. \n\nafter those 2-3 weeks of rest, slowly increase your mileage (if you don't run at all during your break, start at 15mpw and move up from there)

it just happened).\n\ni do very occasionally eat added sugar (think every 3 months or so since january 2021), i still use sweeteners while baking (swerve, monkfruit, xylitol) and still eat fruit every

just sugar with a trace of nutrients that can easily be gotten from better sources). i'm personally not a fan of bananas so i don't eat those, but i regularly top my oatmeal with/eat fruits like raspberries, blueberries, strawberries, cherries, apples, peaches, nectarines, kumquats, etc. \n\ni've personally found that eating these fruits doesn't have any detrimental effect (i went two months without them, and nothing changed; my face is clear while eating them, i function better even while eating them, i am a great athlete while eating them, etc) on how i function, so i eat them. i occasionally eat kiwis, mango, dragonfruit, lychee, papaya, cantaloupe, watermelon, and honeydew too, but that's closer to 1-2 times a month. \n\nnut butters: personally, my favorites are costco's all natural peanut butter (it's just peanuts, oil and salt) and their all natural almond butter (the same but almonds). if i want to add flavor, i mix in a bit of vanilla extract and some cinnamon/pumpkin spice. trader joe's peanut butters, almond butter and cashew butter are also great, just stay away from the hazelnut butter (it's loaded with added sugar).\n\nprotein powder: currently i use body fortress's vanilla creme protein powder (1 scoop: 140 calories, 30g protein, 0g sugar). my family doesn't like the taste and i agree that it *is* an acquired taste, but i really do enjoy eating it in

dates every day to make up for the fact that you can't have sugar, but especially for someone transitioning, fruits aren't bad. even high sugar fruits have nutrients in them. \n\nthis all depends on your personal goals, of course, and whether you're limiting added sugar or overall sugars (i cut out added sugars but end up avoiding honey/maple syrup/etc), but i still eat fruit. if fruit sugars are bad, then we can start demonizing vegetable sugars.....and whole grain, slow acting sugars.....eventually, just carbohydrates in general....and that's headed into keto, and quite frankly, disordered eating territory. it's more unhealthy to eat NO carbs and overfill yourself with high-fat food (usually under the guise of losing weight: fruit and toast is usually way less calorific than cheesy bacon eggs are lmao). \n\ntl;dr each to their own, but we're called r/sugarfree and not r/keto for a reason. fruits are fine, and shouldn't be demonized", "created_utc": "1623291543.0", "edited":
