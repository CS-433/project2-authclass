Saskatchewan isn't really worth applying to as OOP since they only drop four marks and also require 520~ MCAT. Dalhousie is worth applying to as well if your last two years were your best.

Additionally, if someone went through some tragedy or had an excessively difficult time adjusting university, they shouldn't be forced to spend more of their time and money to recover their GPA, universities should be able to recognise that people come from different life experiences and that that doesn't mean you don't deserve to be a doctor. You have a very limited world view and seem to think everyone operates under the same circumstances, and also seem to lack any empathy for anyone at all.\n\nTake someone from a poor family, who was kicked out of the house for being gay. As a result, they fell into a depression. On top of their mental health issues, they face discrimination and they need to work to support themselves. This takes away time from their studies, and they're only able to muster a 3.5 cGPA. \n\nNow on the other hand, someone from a rich family, who were able to support them all throughout university, hire expensive private tutors, expensive studying tools and had connections to get them better research and extracurricular opportunities. As a result, this person is able to finish with a 3.98 cGPA.\n\nAre you telling me that in spite of all the difficulties the first person has to go through, it's \"unfair\" to the second to have some sense of understanding or leeway shown in the admissions process? \n\nSecondly, you are operating under the notion that a cGPA is defining of a candidate's academic ability in all contexts and that there is no room to contextualise a GPA without being unfair to other candidates. You would be very much incorrect in this case, as grading is very complex. Simply put, though, your cGPA is not necessarily a good definition of your academic ability. \n\nThirdly, even operating under the notion, the points you've made about a \"steady record\" mean essentially nothing. There was someone on this subreddit who got a 2 GPA in first year, but then a 4 steadily for the remaining three years. Their cGPA, as a result is only 3.5. Barring the first year, the other three years are likely more reflective of the candidate's abilities. Do you mean to say you believe a 3.5 is more reflective of their ability as a student, even when there was consistent demonstration that they on average perform much higher than that?\n\nFinally, many who have high GPAs would, simply put, be terrible physicians.

While I agree, I think this is the least important reason to not pursue medicine.

You need to be compassionate, passionate, gentle, understanding, intelligent, intuitive, and a million other things, with a genuine interest in improving the quality of life and healthcare for those in your community. If you only care for the money and don't actually care about providing quality healthcare to your community, you're making medicine worse for everyone.

For starters, Niko's eyes are uneven and personally that stood out a lot. The eyes also seem to go.. over her hair? I don't know how to describe it but you'll probably understand what I mean. I know this is done sometimes in anime so it's fine if you were drawing in it for on but I think the colour of the area of the eye that overlaps with the hair is usually less saturated. Another thing is, Niko's pupils, in the game, are in the center of the whites of her eyes, whereas here you've put them on the side. This may be a stylistic choice to make her look cuter in which case it would be fine, just something I wanted to point out in case you didn't notice.\n\nSecondly, the shape of her head is uneven. If you compare the right side to the left side, you'll notice the left side (left from our view) is a little wider than the right and doesn't round out naturally. Because of this, the hair on the left side of the head does not fall naturally. The locks on the left side of her face seem as though they are attached to the inside of the hat rather than her head. I'm also not sure what the dark brown part of her hat is supposed to be exactly.\n\nThirdly, it seems you tried your hand at some shading which is great! In the future, it may be beneficial to clearly determine where the light source is. In this image, the hair suggests that the light source is likely coming from the left (our left) of Niko, whereas the lighting on the scarf appears to be imitating the lighting seen in the game when Niko holds the sun, which is a rather dim light held towards Niko's center. However, as you have not drawn Niko holding the sun here, it does not quite make sense to depict the lighting that way.\n\nOverall, it seems like you were going for more of a chibi style with this so it's a bit difficult to separate what was and wasn't supposed to be a stylistic choice, but I hope these points help you.

I would agree they are the most popular girl group currently and maybe will be of all time, but I wouldn't say they're particularly influential. I feel like they were doing something fresh (or at least, not extremely overdone) in 2016-2017, but their music hasn't really aged with the members (probably owing to the fact that they have fewer than 30 songs in a nearly 6 years career). I can imagine some groups tried to imitate BP's style to try and grab their success, but ultimately it doesn't feel like BP will have the same longlasting impact as, as many others have mentioned, SNSD, or even personally as TWICE will.", "created_utc": "1650172483.0", "edited": "1650172845.0", "id": "i51regv", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_u41usc", "parent_id": "t3_u41usc", "score": "4", "subreddit": "unpopularkpopopinions", "subreddit_id": "t5_gsxgd"}]
