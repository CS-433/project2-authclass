To me, adverbs might as well not exist; they're all adjectives (or states, as you mentioned with \u665a).\n\nIf I want to modify a verb with an adjective, if it goes in front it has a \u5730 (often reduplicated if it's a single character adj), or in formal texts \u7136, if it goes after it has a \u5f97. \n\nStates, like \u65e9\u3001\u665a, etc can appear either in front or after (though there are some peculiarities, you'd never really hear \u6211\u4eec\u665a\u5230\u4e86, rather \u6211\u4eec\u8fdf\u5230\u4e86), and usually there's always a \u4e86 after the verb, or the state if it goes after a verb. \n\nAs for your point 3, it can also be rewritten \u4f60\u4e2d\u6587\u5b66\u5f97\u4e0d\u9519, missing off the first \u5b66, but the intuition here for me with the reduplicated \u4f60\u5b66\u4e2d\u6587\u5b66\u5f97\u4e0d\u9519 is that \u4e0d\u9519 must modify the \u5b66, but is not convenient to put in the \u4f60\u5b66\u4e2d\u6587 phrase, so it gets reduplicated at the end so that your adjective has something to modify.

One can often see clear racism, and no one will bat an eye.\n\nI think, whilst you're probably a good person, you've also taken this fearmongering as the truth. Which is natural, as after all a lie repeated enough times becomes the truth.\n\nAnd especially on social media -- I used to browse reddit generally, but now I really only go on this sub, because any mainstream subreddit will inevitably have some comment pipeline being: China is mentioned -> China bad -> just racism. Or there'll be some over-dramatised post about one instance of racism in China, and you can tell what happens next.\n\nConsider this statement: **\"If someone is racist (in the west), that person is a racist. If someone is racist (in China), chinese people are racist\"**. If you try to look objectively, does this seem to ring true in a lot of the attitudes on western social media?\n\n***Natives will almost always be*** ***over the moon*** that a foreigner is learning their language and wanting to learn about their culture. **Very few** will ever be hostile because you're a westerner. In fact, I daresay chinese hold the west in higher regard than westerners do china.\n\nEven still, westerners in china used to be put on a pedestal, and given priveliged treatment, because they are from the west. The west was seen as developed and cultured, whilst China was seen as undeveloped. This general attitude is melting faster than the US-Chinese relationship.  Now, a lot of expats who once had cushy english teacher jobs or whatever, now no longer are priveliged, leave China and go to r/China complaining about the damn ungrateful chinese-- I digress.\n\nPlus, Chinese people are not blind. Many have VPNs, and can see what western media, and people on western social media are saying, and frankly with the torrent of sludge on some of these platforms it's a wonder why chinese are not *more* hostile to westerners. But hey, you do get similar types of \"content\" on chinese equivalents of 4chan or reddit, which are also shockingly racist, but that just shows how we're all just people, and people are very similar even across such a large cultural divide.\n\nThat said though, if you have strong political opinions that you really want to voice and really really hate the CCP and the Beijing government, might as well move to Taiwan anyway.

It's not great, and whilst most of it was readable, I had no idea what \u65e9\u4e0a\u597d was until I saw people talking about it in the comments. \n\nMain things to focus on would be stroke order, proportion, and spacing. I'll explain in more detail but TLDR make sure your stroke order is correct (or at least follows the rules), and then work on height and proportion. \n\nWhilst the \"one character per square\" rule isn't exactly a strict one for quick handwriting, all the characters will be at least the same height, and usually spaced out enough that you can take them apart. The spacing issue is most notable on the \u559c. Your \u6bdb is too small as well. \n\nThere's also proportion: there are quite a lot of very similar components in Chinese, and, say, not making the \u5182 long enough on \u73b0 makes it look like a combination of \u738b\u6b20(compare to your \u6b22) -- the \u5182 in \u89c1 contributes a lot to the shape of that character (also the last stroke is a \u4e5a and not \u4e36). Another is the \u5e7f in \u5e2d, which looks more like \ud840\udc89, which isn't correct. \n\nAnd finally, stroke order, the thing that will screw up the legibility the most in certain places. For example, and I'm sorry to be blunt, but \u65e9 is totally unrecognisable. I believe there may have been two stroke order issues that caused this: on the \u65e5 you did \u4e28\u4e00\u4e00\u4e28\u4e00 rather than \u4e28\ud840\udccc\u4e00\u4e00, and on the \u5341 you did \u4e28\u4e00 rather than \u4e00\u4e28, and this caused the bottom to look more like \u4e04 than \u5341. In \u5e2d the (**left to right**) \u4e00 comes before the \u4e3f , and so you'll see in chinese handwriting the \u5e7f actually becomes a 7 with a dot on top. \u9633 should not have the sides extending down -- this is a computer font thing and the \u65e5 should be done in the same way as \u65e5 on \u65e9. \u6709 also has a left to right issue on the top part, both \u4e00\u4e3f and \u4e3f\u4e00 are accepted afaik, but the \u4e00 is L-R, and so you can't join them up like that. Finally, \u6c34 is not symmetrical on \u51b0, and your \u662f is wrong (the bottom \u4eba is two strokes).", "created_utc": "1656703433.0", "edited": "False", "id": "iehmits", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_voz7bw", "parent_id": "t3_voz7bw", "score": "1", "subreddit": "ChineseLanguage", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qyz1"}, {"author": "PotentBeverage", "body": "That still makes you not a fluent reader though.
