Most cameras work on the same principle. The shutter sound is the sound it makes when it lets light in to expose the photo-sensitive film. The film will react with the light, giving you a photograph. The shutter opens and closes very quickly, because otherwise the film will be flooded with light and thus the photo destroyed where it has all reacted. The amount of time the shutter is open is called the exposure-time, you can see those crazy photos of the milky way, they are taken with a very long exposure, as there is very little light to capture.", "created_utc": "1659647616.0", "edited": "False", "id": "iiywcrw", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_wfx3vy", "parent_id": "t1_iiwazrb", "score": "1", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i"}, {"author": "mx_ich_", "body": "GPU does not make better guesses.
