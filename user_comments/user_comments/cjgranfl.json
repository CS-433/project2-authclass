It mirrors what most folks here have found effective, and there's some folks here with a lot of effective language learning experience.\n\nI started out with a pair of books in my target language (a teach yourself and colloquial series book) and do a lesson / chapter in each per day whenever I can; life always happens but I try to stay consistent.  I take the new vocabulary from those chapters and add them to an Anki deck, and practice yesterday's content along with today's.  I try to do some Anki drills several times per day.\n\nSome folks will put together decks of the most common words and the like, but for me I want to make sure I'm learning vocabulary in context and figure the most common words will come naturally due to being the most repeated in content I take in.\n\nI've been doing this for several months now, and have gotten enough content in that I can now start working on phase two, which is starting to use a platform like Lingq to read beginner content. I use the spaced repetition / flashcard feature in Lingq as I add \"Lingqs\" (unknown words) from my reading.\n\nIf you do something similar with content aimed at beginners in Greek, you'll soon be able to dive into the approach that really accelerates vocabulary acquisition, which is reading and listening to as much as you can that is just above your level.  You make use of your learned vocabulary during listening and reading, and continue picking up new vocab.\n\nIf you jump right to the native-level content, you miss that middle ground that admittedly is hard to cross.\n\nHope this helps a bit.", "created_utc": "1666828710.0", "edited": "False", "id": "itxbgfj", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_yecjhd", "parent_id": "t3_yecjhd", "score": "1", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "cjgranfl", "body": "As others have added here, there's plenty of avenues where you could leverage IT knowledge in a company working in space sciences.

Say for instance, one section in Colloquial Ukrainian in the morning and one in TY Ukrainian in the evening.  I'll go through the chapter and add new vocab to my Anki deck (content is from both books together in the deck).  The whole idea here is building my initial vocabulary and ensuring that the foundations in grammar are understood.\n\nOutside of that content, I'll review the Anki deck twice a day between those sessions.\n\nPodcast - listening practice -\n\n[Ukrainianlessions.com](https://Ukrainianlessions.com) \\- A fantastic, graded podcast series that I do each day, usually repeating the same podcast twice and maybe again the next day if a lot of new vocab has been introduced.  I add this content to a separate Anki deck, which gets reviewed along with the Anki deck practice above.\n\nI'm on track at this point to hopefully be at about 1500 - 2000 words of vocabulary (and grammar basics) within about 6 months. At that time, I'll be hitting comprehensible input, using Lincq.  This has a built in spaced repetition deck system as well, similar to Anki, built from your \"Lincqs\" (words you identified during listening and reading that you didn't know).\n\nI had started Pimsleur earlier as well, and will probably revisit that throughout the next two months to ensure I'm not getting off track on pronunciation.  \n\nIt sounds like you're on the right track, so just keep working on vocab memorization until you get a solid foundation to get underway with comprehensible input, which is when things should get moving along steadily with lots of interesting options for content.\n\nHope this helps!", "created_utc": "1662084309.0", "edited": "1662085016.0", "id": "imqsasp", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_x3mrwi", "parent_id": "t3_x3mrwi", "score": "17", "subreddit": "Ukrainian", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qum6"}, {"author": "cjgranfl", "body": "Maybe not the same experience you're having, but I've noticed that if I hear something initially there's a bit of time before I \"snap in\" for lack of a better word for it.

I'm looking forward to the historical literature this will unlock for me (and Ukrainian for the same reason).\n\n\\- Icelandic - I've always been fascinated by this country ever since I was a kid in the 80s, long before it started to end up on tourists' radar.  This language's history is remarkable, and being one of the most conservative languages in the indo-european branch means lots of amazing literature options going back centuries.\n\n\\- Finnish - after several years of inefficient study and never getting conversational, I still fell in love with this language.

That alone will have a huge impact on your success, and you should have a different experience in calc this time around.  That said, I'm of the mindset that preparing to be successful in calculus takes a solid foundation in Algebra and Trigonometry, and a lot of folks that I've talked to who are able to pick up calculus concepts at a high level fail at the grind of solving calculus problems because of weaknesses in their algebraic or trig skill set.  The last thing you want is to come in with a positive mindset but still struggle due to a weak foundation here, and end up feeling demoralized, especially when your mindset alone is 90% of the battle.\n\nHave you taken any math placement tests at this point to see what classes you may benefit from versus be able to test out of?  The traditional track prior to calculus at the college level is a college algebra course, followed by algebra 2, and then followed by trigonometry or pre-calculus.  Regarding the difference between algebra 2 + trig vs. pre-calculus there's quite a bit of discussion and thoughts held by folks here, but my thought is that pre-calc is more of a deep dive into both topics assuming some existing knowledge of that level of content.  \n\nIf your algebra 1 level knowledge is on point, maybe algebra 2 followed by pre-calculus to take on the trig and dive deeper / get more practice in algebra is the ticket here, in my opinion.\n\nAlthough it's sometimes thought of as more of a high school tool, I'd recommend having a look at the Khan Academy algebra content, and jump into algebra 1 and 2 to see what's covered, to give yourself a self-assessment.  The content there includes everything through multivariable calc (calculus 2 at most universities), as well as linear algebra.  Plus, it's free.

It's a worthy one.  I can speak to your questions on Khan Academy content, as I've gone through all of the pre-Calculus and Calculus content myself and am currently working through the linear algebra course.\n\nRegarding your question on whether to skip algebra 2 vs. take it in addition to pre-calculus, I'd vote for the latter.  Although it's going to be more time consuming, my personal belief is that you can never be too good at algebra.  In addition, the Khan Academy Algebra 2 course introduces trig, and so when it's built upon with pre-calculus it won't be new. Tons of folks are able to absorb the content of a Calculus trackwork and the main ideas of differentiation and integration, but struggle with algebraic manipulation and core knowledge that can make or break your success in Calculus.  Build a rock solid knowledge of Algebra and Trig and your success in Calculus and Linear Algebra will build on that, and follow on work in differential equations and later higher maths will reflect that.\n\nIf you can find the time, taking the Khan Academy Algebra 2 course will make pre-calculus feel like a review and deeper dive, and a bit of new content (for instance, conic sections are only covered in pre-calculus.).\n\nJust my two cents here.", "created_utc": "1575397456.0", "edited": "False", "id": "f9kcblr", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_e5e7cu", "parent_id": "t3_e5e7cu", "score": "1", "subreddit": "mathematics", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qjc8"}, {"author": "cjgranfl", "body": "Yes, that works too.

The problem with a single-node SME cluster on each side is a lack of redundancy; if you lost that single node, everyone is dependent upon the other SME node for inter-cluster calling.  As long as that's understood, it could conceivably work.  Also important to keep in mind is that there wouldn't be a straightforward bandwidth management (LBM) setup here, since the two SMEs won't be tracking bandwidth utilization for all calls between the clusters as a single SME cluster would, and as your gatekeeper cluster does today.  This will be an important consideration for you to think through prior to migration, and may need to be managed by local Call Admission Control on the leaf CUCM clusters, leaving SME to just do dial plan resolution and routing.\n\n**3** \\- You are correct.  The SMEs by definition cannot register any devices other than trunks or H.323 gateways, including media termination points.  The call signaling would be sent from any given cluster to the SME(s) and the SIP SDP or H.245 call media details would negotiate the RTP endpoints of the call, which would be the voip endpoints.  Provided there's no need to insert an MTP for DTMF interworking, etc., the media would be endpoint to endpoint, with the signaling being between the individual cluster CUCM nodes and the SME environment.\n\nThis is a pretty large environment from the sounds of it, and a pretty complicated undertaking.  I'd definitely recommend a second set of eyes from a trusted Cisco partner or Cisco AS for a double check and for the design and migration planning, but you've got the right questions in mind.\n\nOne last thought; this may be a good time to look to move to SIP trunks to SME vs. preserving H.323.  H.323 is much harder to troubleshoot, and SIP interworking is the standard in almost all newer implementations.

Agree with the other folks here though that keeping moving is the key to recovery.\n\nFor me, I worked through some band glute activation and hip flexor streches, and that along with about 10 days off squatting more than warmup weight did the trick.  You can find some good videos on Youtube if you search on Squat and hip flexors.\n\nSome folks have issues with impingement of their Acetabulum and ball joint, and that's a frequent video topic.  In your case like mine, if you're dealing with a strain / tear vs. impingement, look for the videos specific to stretching and strengthening the glutes and hip flexors.

You mentioned skinny guys staying pretty skinny despite great strength increases.  I'm in a mild caloric deficit (around 300 kcals / day below TDEE), but my diet is very strict and spot on for macronutrient ratios, and am seeing increases in size despite getting leaner.  My theory?  Fat metabolism is contributing the extra calories my body needs to make use of the surplus protein I'm taking in.  If I wasn't a bit overweight (sitting at around 23% bf right now), I don't think I'd be seeing the same hypertrophy increases that I am.\n\nIf you're skinny and don't eat sufficiently to be in a caloric excess with ample protein for muscle fiber synthesis, there's no way for your body to get the extra energy required to add muscle tissue, and much of what you see in strength increases comes from neuromuscular adaptation and a bit of slow body recomposition.\n\nOh, one last note; I'm 43, so wanted to provide that context too since you mentioned your age too.", "created_utc": "1555681749.0", "edited": "1555682228.0", "id": "el9l0zb", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_bex951", "parent_id": "t3_bex951", "score": "5", "subreddit": "Stronglifts5x5", "subreddit_id": "t5_2x8is"}, {"author": "cjgranfl", "body": "A vote for 2a here as well.", "created_utc": "1555610825.0", "edited": "False", "id": "el7cx18", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_bedefw", "parent_id": "t3_bedefw", "score": "1", "subreddit": "skyrim", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s837"}, {"author": "cjgranfl", "body": "My headcannon is that the NPC rage quits when this happens, all pissed off about getting locked up.", "created_utc": "1555604567.0", "edited": "False", "id": "el72p1r", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_beibl3", "parent_id": "t3_beibl3", "score": "1", "subreddit": "skyrim", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s837"}, {"author": "cjgranfl", "body": "I thought I saw a screenshot someone caught of exactly this scenario, a while back.", "created_utc": "1555600180.0", "edited": "False", "id": "el6vyu9", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_behd8i", "parent_id": "t3_behd8i", "score": "3", "subreddit": "skyrim", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s837"}, {"author": "cjgranfl", "body": "Mega burn, good sir.

We need to ensure that the CUCM's SIP trunk IP address matches the address we specify for SIP signaling traffic from the CUBE, or you can get the error you're receiving along with the 503 here.

Do you have logging commands in place in the CUBE config that could be suppressing logging such as \"no logging console\" and / or \"no logging terminal\"?   If you issue a \"terminal monitor\" command at the enable prompt once logged in, you should expect to see your debugging output in your terminal session over Telnet or SSH as long as we're not suppressing terminal logging.
