It makes you look pretentious.)\n\nBlank line\n\nPhone number / Email address (email address in italics)\n\nHorizontal line before the next section\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow, for each of the section heads, increase the font size.  This uses more space.  Heck, maybe a blank line after the heading and before the meat.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn the Education section, the relevant Accounting courses are unimportant since you've completed your degree in accounting.  However, if you've taken relevant courses that aren't accounting courses (or required for your degree), then list them.  And relevant applies to the job you're applying for.

(Normal GPA, GPA in major, Junior/Senior GPA.)\n\nDid you do anything while in school?  Any awards?  Any extracurriculars?  Accounting club officer?  Swept the classroom?  Cleaned the professor's erasers?  Something?\n\nCongratulations on passing the CPA.  What are your plans to earn your license?  (If I was looking at this resume, I'd be wondering my I didn't see something about you being currently in school \"to complete educational requirements\" for the license.)  And make sure that the fact you've passed the exam is prominently mentioned in your cover letter.\n\nAt this point in your career, your professional experience is non-existent.  Drop the word professional.  The only point your non-accounting jobs should show are (1) do you show up for work regularly (which a lot of people right out of college can't do), and (2) is there any history of excellence.  Aim your points in those jobs at these points.  The points you've listed are part of the job description.\n\n(Well, not exactly.  In my pre-accounting days, I dishwashed at a couple places.  Bussing tables was only done at some of the jobs, and I never assisted servers.\n\nA dishwasher job that only lasted five months demonstrates neither the ability to stay employed or the ability to excel.  I'm not sure if that one is even useful.\n\nWere you actually an employee of the high school, or were you a student volunteer?  Fall is not a date range.  Be consistent with your dates.\n\nFor the packer position, was it a summer job for two summers?  If so, it shows you worked well enough that they wanted you back the following year.  The existing points don't demonstrate either of the things that non-accounting jobs should demonstrate.\n\nExperiences and skills?  What experiences did you list here; I only see skills.\n\nIn terms of skills, I've been burned several times by self reported skills.  Look at certifications that you can use to backup your claims of skills.  Microsoft has a series of MOS exams for all the major Office programs.  QuickBooks has it's own certification program.\n\nInterests deserves its own header, especially considering how sparse your resume is.  But you may wish to flesh out your interests.  For example, what is your interest in Fitness?  Do you like looking a physically fit people?  (I do, but I wouldn't put it on a resume.)  Do you run?  Weigh lift?  Etc.\n\nDo you play bass guitar?  Or do you just buy every album that Tony Levin has played on?  If you're in a band, **that's** an activity.  (You do not need to be in a successful band to have an activity.)\n\nYou are living through history, but I doubt that's what your interest is.  Do you just sit at home reading history books?  (Do you learn about aliens by watching the History Channel at night?)  Do you go to battlefields?  Etc.\n\nBTW, you can turn your Investing interest into something good for your resume by forming an investment club.  ([https://www.betterinvesting.org/](https://www.betterinvesting.org/))  This would be a good demonstration of both leadership, training skills, and working with others in a financial setting.\n\nOne hint about the Interests section.  This is where I find my ice breaker questions.  These are the questions I ask at the beginning of the interview.

I'm lucky in that my employer offers three different policies that I can choose from, one an HMO which is focused on local coverage, one that combines a local HMO with national coverage, and one in-between.  Additionally, I can get coverage for myself, or myself and my spouse, or myself, spouse, and children, or myself and children but not my spouse.

When my daughter graduates college I'll be dropping coverage to only myself.)\n\nIf you're getting insurance yourself, you may qualify for healthcare coverage from the [healthcare.gov](https://healthcare.gov) government subsidized web site.

The nations that still are concerned about Russia can join with the United States and the United Kingdom, both of which also appear to take Russian offensive capabilities seriously, and create the CETO (Central European Treaty Organization).\n\nThe issue with a defensive alliance (such as NATO or CETO) is when they move beyond being a defensive alliance and expand into the internal affairs of the member states.

First, there's the insurance to cover costs, etc., if your plans go bad.  Missed flight.  Etc.  Second, there's medical insurance to cover you while overseas.\n\nPersonally, I'm not a big fan of the first type of travel insurance for the long-term traveler.  Recently, my wife and I screwed up our return flight from London.  The airline was fine with rescheduling us on the same flight several days later.  However, because of work issues, we had to fly back the next day.  The first type of travel insurance would be great in that situation.  However, if we were retired, we would say \"heck, London is fun.  We'll just hang out for an extra week.\"  So, if you're travel plans are flexible (and hanging out in Europe for a year seems pretty flexible), I'm not sure that what you get through travel insurance would be worth the cost.  But ultimately, that's your decision.  You decide the whole cost / benefit thing.\n\nNow, for the health insurance aspects, if you're going to hang out in a single European nation, it's time to do some research.  Rather than getting generic travel health insurance, you may find that you can get local insurance much cheaper.  Much of Europe has good government subsidized health coverage.  Check out the costs of just getting that local coverage.\n\nMost of the travel health insurance I've seen covers things like transporting you from a country with poor health care back to a \"civilized\" nation.  Most of Europe has fine health care, so that's not all that useful, either.\n\nPersonally, I'd be looking at heath-oriented travel insurance if either (a) I'd be going to many countries so researching each country's health system would be prohibitive, or (b) I'd be going to countries with less than top-notch health systems and might want to be transported to a country with good health care.\n\nHowever, as with almost everything, your milage may vary.", "created_utc": "1665670132.0", "edited": "False", "id": "is5njqa", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_y2z7n4", "parent_id": "t3_y2z7n4", "score": "3", "subreddit": "travel", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh41"}, {"author": "Equivalent_Ad_8413", "body": "The typical voter will vote based only on the letter after the candidate's name.

As for the salvage value, you get to figure out how much the mold will be worth once it's no longer useful.  Good luck with that.  (A lot of people I know just assume that the asset is worthless at the end of the useful life.)\n\nAs for the molds which aren't any good, they have no value.  If you had capitalized them when you acquired them, you now get to write them off.  And if you never capitalized them in the first place, then there's nothing to depreciate.  (BTW, that's also true for the molds I discussed earlier.  If you didn't capitalize the molds, there's nothing to depreciate.  You don't get to expense the molds when you acquired them AND depreciate them.

Obviously this is something they really want to do.\n\nTo pay for this, the other six months they take whatever job they can and live in the cheapest way possible, just saving up all the money they can to fund their next walk in the woods.\n\nIf travel is what you want to do, you're still going to need to figure out how to pay for it.  Unless you can manage to monetize your travel with some sort of social media account that will fund your travel through advertising, you're going to have to work at least part of the year.

Do you go for instant gratification, work at any job you can for six months while living like a monk and then travel until the money runs out.  Just realize that unskilled work pays crap, so you won't be able to save much money.  Or do you go for deferred gratification, going to school until you have useful skills.

And then while traveling, you'll be living as cheaply as possible.  Every time you go to a nice restaurant, you've probably chopped at least a day off the time before you have to go back to work.\n\nThe third option is what most people do.  Go to school to get useful skills.  (By the way, think about a semester abroad while you're in school. Or think about going to school in a different nation if you've got the language skills.)  Get a job that pays decently.  Have a decent life, with movies, going out occasionally, etc.  And then on your vacation, travel.\n\nYou are not owed anything from other people.

That's a very small sample set.\n\nLooking at your resume, the first thing that sticks out is that you only had one accounting job after graduation and it only lasted fourteen months.  And then you did nothing for the next two and a half years.  That's two danger signs.\n\nFirst, to a lot of old school recruiters for accounting positions, if you have a job for only a year, you failed at it.  Two years (minimum) is the beginning of acceptable, but they really want three years.  They want to know that their investment in you as a new employee will be repaid with the value you bring to the job.\n\nSecond, a two year gap is not a good look.\n\nBoth of these can be addressed in the cover letter, but it's still a large hurdle to get over.\n\nOK, starting at the top.  Did you major in accounting or did you major in business administration with a specialization in accounting?  Universities don't make it easier when then come up with degrees like what you have.  If you GPA is good, add it.  Your job below is barely above entry level.\n\nYou said you took the CPA exam?  Your resume should say if you are CPA eligible (i.e. you've got all the educational requirements) or that you're eligible to take the test.\n\nNormally I'd say that once you've got that first job post-graduation, education should drop below experience.  But given the gap in your work life, I'm not sure you want that to stick out.  You may want to treat this as looking for an entry level position.\n\nIn your Company A & B jobs, who gave you your paycheck?  If it was a staffing agency, then that's your employer.  If you worked at a certain company for the entire fourteen months, that was your job assignment.\n\nCheck your grammar.  Bullet 5 of Company B should be \"recognized\"\n\nHonestly, these jobs aren't really the kind that will move you up in the world.  Other than carpet bombing your city with resumes hoping something sticks, I'm not sure what would work for you other than (maybe) getting a Masters and using your schools job placement service to get an entry level position.  (An entry level CPA job pays significantly more than minimum wage.)\n\nUnder skills, I've been burned repeatedly with people's claimed skills.  See what you can do to get a third party certification for those skills.  With Microsoft Office skills, start with the MO-200 and MO-201 tests in Excel.  From there, you can search for the PowerPoint and Word tests.\n\nI'm not sure if anyone cares about beginner level programming skills.  The [Python Institute](https://pythoninstitute.org/) has a series of certification tests you might want to look at, assuming that's a road you're willing to go down.  (This might end up with you doing something other than accounting.)  There are several SQL certifications available, both for writing code and for running servers.  (Again, this may bring you down a different road.)\n\nAre you a native English or native Tagalog speaker?  The one that you're a native in, label as native.  The other one you should look at a certification to support your claim.  I don't know the certifications for English or Tagalog so I'll let you find the best certification.  However, if they're using the CEFR levels, you probably need at least a B2 and preferably a C1 skill level.  (If you grew up in the United States and learned Tagalog in order to speak to your family, don't assume you know it on the business level.  I did an audit in Puerto Rico.  There were a couple people in the office with the same story.  They grew up in NYC and got a job with the company.  An opening appeared in the job with a nice bump in pay, but it was in PR so they'd need to speak Spanish.  They said \"hey, I've been talking to my family all my life; this should be a piece of cake.\" Turned out they didn't know anywhere near as much Spanish as they thought.  They said that first year in PR was really rough.)\n\nI like hobbies on resumes.  They provide the interviewer with ice breaker questions.  However, I think I'd leave off \"anime\" if you're looking for work in the United States.  Just say movies.  Even then, you might want to drop movies entirely.  With badminton and chess, those are active skills.  You're doing something.  With movies, you're just sitting in a dark room for two hours.  Unless you're making movies.  That would be interesting on your resume.  (Don't ask why reading is good and movies are bad.  Prejudices run rampant among recruiters.)\n\nPersonally, I'm not sure what to do with your resume.  If you can afford it, you might want to consider some sort of restart.  Get your Masters in accounting.  Get your Masters in IT if you like it better.  After you get it, you've got a brand new masters on the top of your resume.  People might not even notice the pre-Masters gap.\n\nBest of luck.", "created_utc": "1656273058.0", "edited": "1656360985.0", "id": "idud9v3", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_vj6g46", "parent_id": "t1_idu6vea", "score": "5", "subreddit": "Accounting", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qw2b"}, {"author": "Equivalent_Ad_8413", "body": "Then it sounds like it's a Wizards problem.\n\nYesterday (or maybe Friday night) I had my first mid-game disconnect.

If you're still working prior to your \"full retirement age\", your income affects the money you get.  For me at my current salary, I'd get nothing.  So if you're working you may wish to put off collecting Social Security until your full retirement age.\n\nSecond, your health.  In general, Social Security payments over your lifetime will add up to the same total amount no matter when you start taking Social Security **if** you die at your government calculated life expectancy.  Unless you have access to Professor Pinero's machine, you don't know when you're going to die.  But you do know your family history and your current health.  If you think you're going to die before your life expectancy, then start taking the money as soon as possible.  But if you think you'll live longer than your life expectancy, then (if you can) put off collecting Social Security until you're seventy.  Do not delay past seventy; at that point you're only throwing money away.\n\nThird, political. According to the latest Trustee's Report, Social Security's Retirement Trust Fund will hit zero in 2034.  At that point, under current law Social Security goes into Pay-As-You-Go mode, paying out benefits as it collects taxes.  The immediate result will be a 23% drop in benefits and a **very** gradual reduction in benefits from then on.  If you think Congress won't manage to fix Social Security between now and then, you may want to start your benefits sooner so that you can sock the money away outside of the trust fund.  On the other hand, if you think Congress will actually do something so that benefits aren't affected, then you can ignore this.\n\nFor me, I don't trust Congress as far as I can throw them.  (There are hundreds of members of Congress.  The total weight is a lot more than I can pick up, much less toss.)  So my plan is to start collecting Social Security as soon as I hit \"full retirement\", and simultaneously max out my 403(b) and IRA contributions.  I suspect I'll still have \"extra\" money which I'll have to put into a normal investment account.  But it's still better than letting the federal government hold on to it in their Trust Fund.

Let's use a typical journey as an example...\r  \n\r  \nA simple example...\r  \nLet's assume your itinerary includes a journey from Berlin to Prague...\r  \n\r  \nHow much does point to point cost?\r  \n\r  \n\\- From \u20ac18.90 with an advance-purchase fare, limited availability, specified train only, no changes, no refunds, no flexibility.\r  \n\r  \n\\- Or \u20ac72.00 with a flexible ticket bought at the station on the day, unlimited availability, good for any train.\r  \n\r  \nHow much does a pass cost?\r  \n\r  \n\\- \u20ac56.40 per day using a 5-days-in-1-month Eurail global pass (that's the adult 5-day pass price divided by 5)\r  \n\r  \n\\- \u20ac43.40 per day using a 5-days-in-1-month youth Eurail global pass (the youth price divided by 5)\r  \n\r  \n\\- \u20ac40.10 per day using a 10-days-in-2-months Eurail global pass (the 10-day adult price divided by 10)\r  \n\r  \n\\- \u20ac30.10 per day using a 10-days-in-2-months youth Eurail global pass (the youth price divided by 10)\r  \n\r  \nA pass gives you unlimited travel, so you can use any Berlin-Prague train you like, just like the \u20ac72 flexible ticket (better, in fact, as you could go up & down on trains between Berlin & Prague all day if you so desired, or change your mind and carry on beyond Prague to Bratislava or Vienna)\r  \n\r  \nSo is a pass the cheapest option?\r  \n\r  \nNo, the \u20ac18.90 advance-purchase ticket is cheapest option.  It's not a trick question!\r  \n\r  \nIt's also the easiest option, book it online at the German Railways website and show it on your phone.  Click, click, booked!\r  \n\r  \nSo if you're only planning 2, 3 or maybe 4 such trips and your dates are confirmed, maybe your accommodation is pre-booked and you're happy to commit to a specific train a month or two in advance on a no-refunds, no-changes basis, then advance-purchase tickets are the cheapest option.  I explain the best way to buy tickets for specific routes on the how to buy tickets page.\r  \n\r  \nJust remember that \u20ac18.90 is the cheapest possible price, these advance-purchase fares have limited availability and vary in price just like air fares.  On your date it might cost \u20ac24.90 or \u20ac27.90 or \u20ac34.90, depending when you book and how popular that date or train is, just like flights.\r  \n\r  \nSo does a Eurail pass still make sense?\r  \n\r  \nYes, a pass still makes sense if you value flexibility, because it's significantly cheaper than the \u20ac72 full-flex fare.\r  \n\r  \nWith an advance-purchase ticket you're nailing your plans to the floor months in advance.  Trading up to a Eurail pass gives you the freedom to travel when you want - or even where you want, you can decide on the spur of the moment not to go to Prague after all, but to Budapest instead.  And as a pass gives you unlimited travel all day, you can make additional journeys before or after this one if you need to.\r  \n\r  \nFor a longer and more complex tour of Europe, using a stack of advance-purchase tickets would be risky:  If a flood, fire, landslide or national strike knocked out one journey, the rest of the trip could come crashing down like a house of cards because advance-purchase tickets become worthless if you miss the train.  A Eurail pass gives you the flexibility to re-plan, re-schedule or even re-route as necessary.\r  \n\r  \nFor example, Mrs 61 and I once travelled to Italy from my in-laws' house in the Netherlands using a pass.  The day before we were due to return, a train accident in Belgium completely blocked our planned Milan-Paris-Rotterdam route, but with our passes we could easily divert via Milan-Zurich-Cologne-Rotterdam.  That flexibility can be worth paying for, a form of built-in insurance.\r  \n\r  \nLet's take a more expensive example:  Amsterdam-Berlin:\r  \n\r  \nHow much does point to point cost?\r  \n\r  \n\\- From \u20ac37.90 with an advance-purchase fare, specified train only, no changes, no refunds.\r  \n\r  \n\\- \u20ac126 with a flexible ticket bought at the station on the day, good for any train.\r  \n\r  \nHow much does a pass cost?\r  \n\r  \n\\- \u20ac56.40 per day using a 5-days-in-1-month Eurail global pass (adult price divided by 5)\r  \n\r  \n\\- \u20ac43.40 per day using a 5-days-in-1-month youth Eurail global pass (youth price divided by 5)\r  \n\r  \n\\- \u20ac40.10 per day using a 10-days-in-2-months Eurail global pass (adult price divided by 10)\r  \n\r  \n\\- \u20ac30.10 per day using a 10-days-in-2-months youth Eurail global pass (youth price divided by 10)\r  \n\r  \nIn this case, the 10-day adult Eurail pass is only a little more per day than the cheapest advance-purchase fare, and the 10-day youth Eurail saves money over that fare.  And all adult & youth Eurail passes save a lot of money over the full-flex fare.\r  \n\r  \nBut don't use a pass for a short hop...\r  \n\r  \nVienna to Bratislava only costs \u20ac11 or so, full-flex, bought at the station on the day.  Florence to Pisa is only around \u20ac8 each way.\r  \n\r  \nIt'd be cheaper to buy a 4-days-in-1-month pass plus a normal ticket for a short hop like these, than to buy a 5-days-in-1-month pass.  Common sense, surely?  You can check prices for specific journey by selecting the starting city here.\r  \n\r  \nRemember to factor in the passholder reservation fees...\r  \n\r  \nWhen comparing point-to-point fares with a Eurail pass, the point to point fares you see online always include the cost of any compulsory reservation.  But if you use a pass, you sometimes have to pay a reservation fee in addition to the cost of the Eurail.  Here's a rule of thumb:\r  \n\r  \nIn France, Italy, Spain, reckon on paying a \u20ac10 reservation fee for every train other than purely local ones, in addition to the cost of the pass.\r  \n\r  \nYou need to pay a passholder fare to use Eurostar between London & Paris, Lille, Brussels or Amsterdam.  This costs \u20ac30 in 2nd class or \u20ac38 if you have a 1st class pass, see Eurostar passholder information here.\r  \n\r  \nOn overnight sleeper trains you need to pay for a sleeping-berth, typically \u20ac34 for a couchette or \u20ac94 for a bed in a 2-bed sleeper.\r  \n\r  \nHowever, in Benelux, Switzerland, Germany, Austria, Denmark & most of eastern & central Europe, there are usually no fees to pay (unless you want a sleeping berth), you can just board a train, sit in any empty unreserved seat, and show your pass when the conductor come along.  That's a generalisation, but in these countries, even if a seat reservation is required, it's typically only \u20ac2 - \u20ac5, the same as any other ticket-holder would pay to reserve a seat.\r  \n\r  \nThere's a full list of Interrail reservation requirements & costs in each country here.\n\nhttps://www.seat61.com/how-to-use-a-eurail-pass.htm", "created_utc": "1655929816.0", "edited": "False", "id": "idcio16", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_vie5zd", "parent_id": "t1_idch9y9", "score": "4", "subreddit": "travel", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh41"}, {"author": "Equivalent_Ad_8413", "body": "Take a look at the prerequisites for the courses in the Masters Program in Space Studies at the University of North Dakota ([https://aero.und.edu/space/](https://aero.und.edu/space/)) or at American Public University (https://www.apu.apus.edu/academic/schools/science-technology-engineering-and-math/masters/space-studies.html).", "created_utc": "1655929549.0", "edited": "False", "id": "idci16v", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_vie94t", "parent_id": "t3_vie94t", "score": "1", "subreddit": "space", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh87"}, {"author": "Equivalent_Ad_8413", "body": "The last Mastery Pass included 3 packs for the latest set.
