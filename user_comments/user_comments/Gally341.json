TLDR at the bottom if you need.\n\nTwo things really helped me with verb conjugation:\n\n* [This workbook](https://www.amazon.it/Practice-Makes-Perfect-Italian-Premium/dp/126045343X) I got at a bookshop\n* **But most importantly**, [the Anki Deck you can download from this site](http://www.asiteaboutnothing.net/w_italian-conjugation-flashcards.html)\n\nI don't know if you use Anki or another flashcard system already, but.... dude... I cannot tell you HOW MUCH that Anki Deck helped me get my head around Italian verb conjugations.\n\nThough it was a lot of work and there was a lot of trial and error involved. To simplify the process:\n\n1. [**Read the guide on using the Anki Deck**](http://www.asiteaboutnothing.net/w_italian-conjugation-flashcards.html)**.** Don't skip this step. It explains how to use it; it's a little weird (trust the process).\n2. Do the Anki Deck, however many cards you can handle at a time. **Do it every day** (or at least try to...)\n3. **Acknowledge the fact that you are going to suck at first.** Especially with verb tenses like *Passato Remoto* and *Congiuntivo Passato* \\-- two verb tense you likely have not been exposed to yet at your learning level. (sidenote: third person plurals always *fuck* me up in these tenses)\n   1. Elaborating on this point -- you are going to get a lot of cards wrong. It's alright. Just keep going. You'll eventually get the hang of it. Sometimes it helps to type out the entire conjugation of a verb in a certain tense, so that you can start to see the patterns, how the spelling changes with certain consonant clusters, etc...\n4. **Supplement the deck with further research and learning.** Don't know what *congiuntivo* is and why it's important? Look up some videos or articles online and get educated, son.\n\nAnd that's it really. To be honest, I stopped using the deck in the middle of the 11th word (*dovere*) because I felt like I was getting the hang of the conjugations patterns at that point.\n\nThe benefits of doing that deck, even only the 20% of it that I completed, are worth the time. Your comprehension of spoken and written Italian will increase ***tenfold*** when you understand verb patterns. Let's look at an example sentence from an Italian article written today:\n\n*\"Per\u00f2 se non* ***vinciamo*** *domenica* ***faremmo*** *un passo indietro.* ***Affronteremo*** *una squadra che* ***sar\u00e0*** *determinata, consapevole di chi* ***andr\u00e0*** *ad* ***affrontare***\\*.\"\\*\n\nI'd be really lost trying to figure out what this means before going through the pains of learning verb conjugations. In this sentence alone, we have *Presente, Condizionale,* *Futuro, e Infinitivo*. Even if you don't know every word, knowing where you are in the sentence's timeline helps tremendously in comprehending new input.  And if you need a rough translation:\n\n\"If we don't win Sunday we would be taking a step back. We will face a team that will be determined, aware of who they are going to face.\"\n\n**TL;DR: It takes time, hard work, and patience to grasp verb conjugations, but it will take you to the next level more quickly (however you decide to do it).**", "created_utc": "1664932850.0", "edited": "1664933030.0", "id": "ir3g0hs", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_xvhe9t", "parent_id": "t3_xvhe9t", "score": "6", "subreddit": "italianlearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2tuxf"}, {"author": "Gally341", "body": "Like the top comment says, there's a few factors.\n\nI started seriously learning Italian this year and it took me probably 6.5 months to call myself \"A2\" but some facts about me:\n\n* English is my first language\n* I took Italian in high school (so I remembered some basics on gender, articles, basic vocab, pronunciation, etc... but I wouldn't have called myself \"A1\" at the start)\n* I was going HAM at the beginning, like 15 to 20 hours a week\n* I read [this guide](https://sajforbes.nz/languageguide/introduction/) at the start, which helps to shape your studying methods a lot\n* I'd also call myself a quick learner", "created_utc": "1664930796.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ir3bkui", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_xvl70s", "parent_id": "t3_xvl70s", "score": "9", "subreddit": "italianlearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2tuxf"}, {"author": "Gally341", "body": "Oh what, and my boy Mason Geertson can't?!?!?", "created_utc": "1664390340.0", "edited": "False", "id": "iq9ovnx", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_xqb2ku", "parent_id": "t3_xqb2ku", "score": "1", "subreddit": "devils", "subreddit_id": "t5_2roo0"}, {"author": "Gally341", "body": "Wait.

Until they play better team defense, goaltending stabilizes, and the special teams find chemistry, they will inconsistently win (and more often lose) games.

How could they start 7-3-2 and then suck this bad? I understand that their schedule was weak to start the year, and maybe they won some games they shouldn't have because of late game heroics, good goaltending, or what have you... but they were keeping on a good point pace even when facing some tough squads.\n\nYou can't tell me this team sucks this bad -- these games they dropped to the Senators, Flyers, Red Wings.... these are games that we would have been way more competitive in during the first 10% of the season. \n\nAnd injuries are not an excuse. We survived without Jack, survived without Dougie, and we haven't had Miles Wood all year.\n\nI just don't get it. Maybe most of these guys aren't \"gamers\" -- maybe that mental hunger is missing. I remember one of the Denver Broncos recalled that the key to being successful in the playoffs is having more \"dogs\" than the other team, which he described as guys that absolutely have to, nay **need** to, win at all costs. He said the Patriots always had more dogs.\n\nMaybe we just need more dogs. Fire Recchi, but fire that damn psychologist they hired too. \n\nThis team has suffered from a lack of leadership among players, coaches, and the front office. No one has guts or balls. Shero kind of had that, but he gambled on Taylor Hall, and he lost in the end. Can't blame him for making that trade or trying to build around him after that MVP season.\n\nMost of us obviously don't know how these guys are outside of the 60 minutes we watch them per game. Nico could be a complete party animal and Geertson might like going to museums with Dougie. But there needs to be some guys in that room that take leadership and instill confidence in the rest of the team. Losing cultures can be broken. But it's hard. Real hard.\n\nJust rambling. No one is probably gonna read this. I'm pretty checked out on this season. It's really sad. Almost got my hopes up for this stupid ass franchise again.

Especially if you live outside of North NJ. There's honestly not a lot of us to begin with, and that's why we are usually \"no nonsense\" fans. Repping your Devils gear out in public is like a badge of honor. A testament that you're a true New Jerseyan. Not unlike your fellow statesmen wearing Rangers, Isles, Flyers, and Penguins (penguins?!) gear.\n\nIt's also a mark of suffering lately. God we've been awful. We're not Philly bad, but we will let the team have it sometimes. And for what it's worth, we started the trend of booing Gary Betmann back when our team was in talks of relocation...during its first Stanley Cup run.\n\nWe can be crass when we win too - someone starts a \"Rangers suck!\" whistle-to-chant every home game, even when we are playing some random ass west coast team like the Coyotes. We also like to remind the opposing team that they suck everytime we hit the twine. Yes, even when the Devils scored to ruin the away goalie's shutout bid, making the game a cool 1-5 blowout in the waning minutes of the third. We're east coast in that sense.\n\nBut there's also great pride in rooting for the Devils. We're a small but loud fan base with a little brother mentality, and we are right on the cusp of surpassing our neighbors to the east. The team is building something special. Players want to come to NJ to play with Hughes and Nico. We have three cups to our name -- and they are probably the only reason the team still exists.\n\nSeriously. Think about it -- you put a team in a market that is already contested by an original six club, a club that is about to win 4 straight, and the fucking Flyers? And you market them as a New Jersey team, one of the least charismatic states in the lower 48? Bro, you need your head examined. But bless John McMullen for granting us a New Jersey hockey team. There's no better feeling than seeing our arena packed, red jerseys clamoring, going wild over a Jack Hughes overtime dangle.\n\nI love the Devils. If you see a Devils fan in the wild, they are very likely a true hockey fan.
