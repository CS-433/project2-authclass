Most went to a 4yr college nursing programs that culminated in their BSNs, took the NCLEX became RNs and began their careers as nurses.\n\nI suppose that's a huge change from the days that only required a HS Diploma to be a nurse.\n\n- CNA program is 8-12 weeks and then you're hired as a CNA. \n\n- LVN/LPN program is 1-2 years and then you're hired as an LVN/LPN.\n\n- ADN is 2yrs and then you're hired as an RN.\n\n- BSN at Samuel Merritt is 2yrs (with prior coursework) and then you're an RN.\n\n- Accelerated BSN (ABSN) at Samuel Merritt is 12 months. \n\n- Accelerated MSN (AMSN) at Samuel Merritt is ~20-24 months.\n\nI've met CMs, CRNAs, FNPs, all MSN and BSN RNs who have gone through either the ABSN or ELMSN program. \n\nWhat I've noticed is that those that went through the Accelerated versions of the programs (prior degree required - from any field) have greater cognitive abilities. \n\nI've met lawyers, engineers, architects, etc. which today are RNs, FNPs, and one is a CRNA (they switched careers because their fields were decimated by technology).\n\nI suppose that's why Samuel Merritt has an accelerated path and a traditional pathway. That's also true with JD and MBA programs - there are accelerated and traditional.\n\nThe CRNA was previously an architect - went from BSN RN with no work experience as an RN directly to the ER and then ICU in a year. After which they entered into the CRNA program and straight back to the same hospital working as a CRNA. \n\nThey graduated at the top of the program - filled with plenty of RNs with many years of experience - many of which didn't make it, in spite of all those years of nursing experience. \n\nAn RN case manager or an FNP doesn't need CNA, LVN/LPN or phlebotomist experience to do their jobs. They're not doing blood draws or spoon feeding patients in those jobs. They're using critical thinking skills and their education.\n\nRegardless of where we start in any new field, we all enter that level without experience - cops, firemen, electrician, etc. all get their training and enter the job. \n\nIf we want to blame anyone, blame the corporatization of hospitals that cut the new grad nursing transition programs. \n\nMaybe hospitals should have a model that's similar to MD residency for those entering the nursing profession or some other transition / apprentice type program.", "created_utc": "1659763337.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ij5hsxx", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_wh2t1s", "parent_id": "t1_ij4ap1h", "score": "3", "subreddit": "nursing", "subreddit_id": "t5_2ra72"}, {"author": "Cloud9", "body": "Scan, scan, scan - OneNote or iPhone / Android.

They were hiring in India ~15,000 and laying off in the US. But for those that may not know, at least at that time, there were two IBM India entities. One held the ex-pats and the other employees native to India - with two salary and benefit structures. \n\nOne of my Indian colleagues in the U.S. decided to take a transfer to IBM India rather than being laid off - as did several others in his unit. Well, his colleagues were placed in the IBM India unit with full benefits, except for him. None in the unit knew there were two IBM India until they got there. \n\nHe raised the issue explaining that he's a U.S. citizen that just happens to be Indian. IBM refused to place him with the rest of his group and the salary differences were extreme as one might imagine. So at the end of the day, he just ended up quitting there. Losing out on both his severance (had he accepted the layoff in the U.S.) and most of his benefits. \n\nAnother \"loophole\" is the underreporting of layoffs. As I came to discover, locations with less than 50 employees, do not have to be reported - anyone that has ever worked at IBM knows they have (or had) a high number of teleworkers. Many began their jobs at IBM without being attached to any physical location, just working from home, for units that do not have physical locations because all the workers are remote. Those types of employees aren't necessarily captured in these 'mass layoffs' - only business locations with 50+ employees get reported. \n\nSo plenty of people that work from home or locations that have right around 50 employees (they'll transfer a few employees to hit the less than 50 goal) don't show up in those numbers ([DOL](https://www.dol.gov/general/topic/termination/plantclosings)) So if you see a news headline that says, \"10,000 impacted by IBM layoffs\" you can rest assured that it's more than 10,000.", "created_utc": "1649382527.0", "edited": "False", "id": "i3ueesd", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_ty086u", "parent_id": "t1_i3r87hu", "score": "1", "subreddit": "technology", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh16"}, {"author": "Cloud9", "body": "Oh I agree with you, but these are folks that began working at IBM before a 401k was even available.

Little did they know that even though they had been \"grandfathered\", they'd ultimately get laid off. That was a significant blow to their retirement plans. Not to mention the job loss itself. \n\nAs for ESPP, what I was pointing out is [IBM's history as it pertains to that benefit](https://www.discerningreaders.com/ibm-employee-stock-purchase-plan-espp.html).

Here's the [Spanish version](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23361.Living_Language_Conversational_Spanish) to give you an idea. And / or Olly's \"101 conversations [Insert Language]\" series.\n\nThose are my main resources. Are there other resources?

It seems that people see this image differently. \n\nSome view it as the result of Bitcoin (or crypto) whereas one can look at it as the result of the  ***pursuit*** of value (crypto). What we don't see is the comparison - that is, the pursuit of *fiat* value. That's less direct and harder to see in a single picture, but we're all well aware of precious metals mining, oil extraction, etc.\n\nBitcoin (crypto) and fiat will outlive us all. If the comparison isn't the pursuit of value, but just the end products, then we have Bitcoin/crypto vs. fiat/precious metals (gold, silver, etc.). \n\nThe comparison point, at a minimum, would be global. But we have to acknowledge that crypto is just a little over a decade old vs. fiat that has been around for hundreds of years - and gold/silver even longer. Who knows what it'll look like in hundreds of years' time?\n\nTo get an idea of the resource consumption of fiat, we'd have to compare the entire global financial system and its energy consumption. We'd also have to acknowledge that it does not serve the entire population, just as crypto does not serve the entire population. \n\nWhat would that look like? Using https://fiatmarketcap.com we get a general idea. 116 fiat currencies covering 140 countries. We'd have to look at how many central banks there are in the world - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_central_banks\n\nThat list looks like ~200+ countries.

What is global mining energy consumption? \n\nCentral banking in the US alone would be 13 branches, ~10,000 banks and ~75,000 commercial bank branches - buildings, people, etc. excluding credit unions and other non-banking entities.\n\nThe US banking sector alone employs ~1.9 million people\nThe European banking sector employs ~2.62 million\nThe Chinese banking sector employs ~4.2 million  \n...and so on... to include all of Asia (minus China), Russia, South and Central America, Africa, the Middle East, Australia, etc.\n\nWe'd have to continue this process and account for the energy consumption of building, maintaining, and servicing every physical asset used in the global banking sector to support all fiat (at a minimum, even though we ignore gold, silver, etc.). \n\nOn the crypto side, we'd have to account for the ~1M bitcoin miners (who also mine many other cryptos), data centers, and smaller miners. \n\nFor profitability reasons, crypto mining seeks out the lowest energy resources - both traditional and renewables. It can be thought of as a form of energy arbitrage. The race is on to seek out the lowest energy resources to mine crypto - even volcanic sources. https://apnews.com/article/cryptocurrency-technology-business-bitcoin-central-america-e0074a2343a3e3a9beb08723ff65ecf5\n\nFor the aforementioned banking sector subset which excludes most countries and regions of the world...  \n\nWhat would the aggregate energy consumed by the creation, maintenance and servicing of physical assets + employees, to run the facilities and serve the customer base, equate to?\n\nWould a per capita energy consumption metric be a fair comparison when one system has hundreds of years head start?\n\nA crypto coin / token, once created, theoretically lasts forever.

We'd have to account for the global banking sector technology - data centers, employee computers, etc. and every technology 'refresh'.\n\nIn other words, it would be a significant effort to perform a true comparison between the energy consumption of crypto vs. fiat - and even then we'd still be missing the comparisons to gold, silver, etc.\n\nWe could look at this another way using small countries as proxy and looking at the national money supply market cap in BTC. \n\n~4 BTC is equivalent to Sao Tome And Principe circulating money supply of 3,265,000,000 STD\n~50 BTC is equivalent to Tajikistan circulating money supply of 24,354,000 TJS\n~52 BTC is equivalent to Malawi circulating money supply of 1,816,000,000 MWK\n\nSource: https://fiatmarketcap.com/Country\n[Currency converter] Source: https://www.unitconverters.net/currency-converter.html\n\nMost BTC was mined in its early years - https://www.statista.com/statistics/247280/number-of-bitcoins-in-circulation\n\nSo the comparison of BTC without a qualifier as to when it was created would be misleading - to create 4 BTC today would require significantly more energy. \n\nFour BTC created in 2009 is an insignificant amount of energy consumption compared to STD currency which in all likelihood has been created more than once as fiat banknotes wear out, but we're only counting it once. \n\nThough this is not really about BTC being an environmental disaster - we regularly waste enough food to feed the bottom 3 billion people. Ironically, agriculture (to produce all that food) is one of the leading causes of deforestation.\n\nWhat's the environmental impact of the global food waste? Deforestation? Decades of war in countries around the world? The energy consumption going into the creation, use and maintenance of the world's weaponry? \n\nOne doesn't have to go far to see enormous amounts of waste and inefficiency in our society. \n\nCorporations regularly destroy perfectly good, new products they produce in order to maintain artificial scarcity and price. Fashion brands are the worst offenders, but it's a widespread practice across numerous industries. Most of the household names from Amazon to Disney and luxury brands, supermarkets, etc. all do it.\n\nIn light of the amount of energy consumed around the world in the creation of goods, simply to destroy unsold goods, because they couldn't get the price they wanted for those goods or want to maintain ongoing artificial scarcity and pricing power, crypto seems like an odd target for anticonsumption.", "created_utc": "1641966923.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hsbdjeh", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_s1cqvn", "parent_id": "t3_s1cqvn", "score": "1", "subreddit": "Anticonsumption", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r83n"}, {"author": "Cloud9", "body": "https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/10/covid-vaccine-pfizer-ceo-says-omicron-vaccine-will-be-ready-in-march.html", "created_utc": "1641888315.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hs6l61r", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_s0a7tc", "parent_id": "t1_hs4u5er", "score": "1", "subreddit": "Coronavirus", "subreddit_id": "t5_2x4yx"}, {"author": "Cloud9", "body": "https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/10/covid-vaccine-pfizer-ceo-says-omicron-vaccine-will-be-ready-in-march.html", "created_utc": "1641888306.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hs6l5m7", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_s0a7tc", "parent_id": "t1_hs4te3i", "score": "1", "subreddit": "Coronavirus", "subreddit_id": "t5_2x4yx"}, {"author": "Cloud9", "body": "Maybe.

I asked him how he could be so sure and he said something to the effect of - \"Isn't it obvious? Every subject is just a language - just like the one you're speaking now and you learned that one, didn't you?\"\n\nThat simple insight has led to a lifetime of learning.\n\nFrom that point on, all academic subjects were just 'languages' to be learned - the language of mathematics, the language of chemistry, the language of biology, anatomy, physiology, and so on. \n\nIt led to software development (Assembly, Basic, COBOL, Pascal, C, Fortran, etc.), database admin, system admin, network engineer, IT sales, marketing, management, business development, project management, etc. - \n\nSure, those are programming languages, not human languages, but what is a language?

It's the (implied) premise that I question.\n\nPerhaps growing up bilingual results in a blind spot - as the experience of being monolingual and learning a second language, particularly as an adult, is not something I can relate to. I can only relate to the language learning experience and in some ways even that is muted because I tend to gravitate towards languages with a close lexical distance to my native languages. So learning another Romance language from a Spanish or Italian base, while still requiring work, is much easier than a completely unrelated language.\n\nFrom my perspective, the centricity of a language may help some non-native learners, particularly in sourcing and scope of language learning materials, but to my way of thinking it isn't a critical or limiting factor.\n\nThe lead that I buried before was simply that in practical terms, pluricentricity doesn't have as great an impact as a non-native language learner may perceive when it comes to learning a language. \n\nThe drinking straw example was meant to indicate not only the differences, but the fact that most native speakers don't notice these differences. Why? Because most people live their entire lives in their country of origin and never hear them. Most don't even have a passport. Only those that immigrate or travel are likely to encounter them or if a native speaker runs into a tourist in their country.\n\nIn the U.S., I can travel to all 50 States and be understood. I'd be fine in the U.K., Canada, Australia etc. sure there are some differences, but they would be minor by comparison. \n\nThat's often not the case with other languages. My ex is Chinese and I grew up with many Chinese. I thought if I learned Chinese (Mandarin or Cantonese), I could communicate with all of them (I was young). Until I learned that in their own families they could not communicate with every family member. Chinese is a group or family of languages, but in the western world, we have a tendency to refer to them as dialects. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_varieties_of_Chinese\n\nAs it was explained to me, for a Cantonese speaker, Hakka or Mandarin are very different languages - not mutually intelligible. Spanish and Italian or Norwegian and Danish would be more mutually intelligible by comparison.\n\n\u201c\u2026 Mandarin and Amoy Min Nan (dialect of Hokkien) are 62% phonetically similar and 15% lexically similar. \n\n**By comparison, German and English are 60% lexically similar.** https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hokkien\n\nThis is why most Chinese TV media has subtitles - in Chinese (the written characters are the same). \n\nEven if we just focused on Mandarin, it's not spoken the same across the country. A Taiwanese Mandarin speaker will find it difficult to understand a Northeast Mandarin speaker. And that's focusing on the official language of the country.\n\nThis is also the case with India as explained to me by Indian friends and co-workers. Two of my co-workers are native Indians from different regions and the only language they can communicate in is English despite each one knowing more than one Indian 'dialect'. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_languages_by_number_of_native_speakers_in_India\n\nBut I digress. To a much lesser extent than the extreme examples above, this is also true of Spanish. Even within Spain, knowledge of (Castillian) Spanish isn't going to help you communicate with say a Basque speaker. It *may* help with a Catalan speaker, just like it would help with an Italian or Portuguese speaker. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Languages_of_Spain\n\nWhen I'm asked by those seeking to learn Spanish 'which version of Spanish' they should learn, I ask them what their objectives are - if they just want to live in Mexico, I tell them to learn that. If they want to retire in Spain, then learn Castillian Spanish. Would they be mutually intelligible? Yes! Would there be differences? Yes.

Let me explain.\n\nIn my family, we all grew up bilingual. My father always, even to this day, spoke with us in English. My mother always spoke with us in Spanish. They're both completely fluent in both languages. \n\n'Spanglish' was never heard in our household growing up. You could choose to answer in Spanish or English, but never mix them. \n\nWhen we lived in Spanish speaking countries, we used more English at home. When we lived in the NYC, we used more Spanish at home. My siblings only speak English. I can speak with them in Spanish and they'll understand and respond in English. They can read a book or watch a movie in Spanish, but they find it difficult to speak or write. \n\nNone of us even heard about 'Spanglish' until our late teens. When I came across it in HS, I thought those using Spanglish just couldn't speak one or either of the languages well. I found out that wasn't true at all when I befriended some of those speakers. They were fluent in both languages. For them, it was just a matter of selective comfort or whether they felt something was better expressed in one language or another. \n\nOne of our friends grew up in Europe and in their multi-generational household 5 languages were spoken daily. The only time I ever saw them mix languages was when they were emotional and arguing.

In my case, I self-represented (Pro Per). The main reason behind that was my ex's litigiousness and their family being well off. Their strategy was simply to outlast me, but it sounds like that's not your situation.\n\nDuring the property division, I identified all pre-marital property (no matter how old) and had all the receipts for all of it. When challenged in court as community property, I produced the receipts and the judge ruled in my favor. That eliminated most of the items of value from consideration. \n\nFor the marital property, I hired a certified divorce financial analyst. They went through every financial asset and liability and determined ownership (joint) prior to the date of separation and (sole) after the date of separation. It was all laid out on the propertizer. \n\nThe court order I received for my ex to pick up their things was based on a motion I filed with the court. Before I filed that motion, I thought through all the scenarios and I requested that specific language be included to the order. Previously, I had to call the police on two occasions due to my ex violating court orders. Given that history, plus my attempts to get them to pick up their personal belongings (more below), my motion was granted and the court order was very specific (ex cannot damage any property / destroy property on site or leave it elsewhere on the property (curbside, lawn, etc.).\n\nAs part of the order, my ex could not enter the home (even though they were a joint owner). They were limited to the one garage. An independent 3rd party was allowed to enter the home and take inventory of all items. They were not allowed to remove anything, just take visual inventory and video record the walk through. I walked through the house with them providing access to every area - rooms, drawers, safes, etc. [They attempted to engage me in discussion several times during the video recording, but I simply stated that they're here to take inventory and nothing more]. \n\nThey reviewed the video and the inventory list and their attorney sent a list of items that belonged to my ex. I brought the smaller items of value (jewelry) to the court with me during the appearance regarding the motion I had filed and those items were properly identified and turned over in court. All other personal belongings and larger items were moved into the garage before the date on the court order (clothes, shoes, bicycle, electronics, houseware, kitchenware, etc.) \n\nDuring the property division, I did not particularly care about furniture, electronics, kitchenware, etc. all of that stuff is easily replaced and has low resale value.\n\nYou may be interested in the efforts that preceded the motion I filed. \n\nI emailed my ex and their attorney to select a date and time (from the dates/times I provided) to remove their personal belongings. It was a very brief and dry email - one to two sentences and dates/times (3-5) and every 2 weeks, I would send another email with the same language and new dates. \n\nI had about 6 of those emails when I filed my motion and stated all the email dates, and dates/times offered in the motion. During the court appearance, I provided copies to the court.\n\nIt sounds like you had a boilerplate court order. Unless the court order explicitly states that the party cannot enter the home, there is nothing the police can do. \n\nSince you have kids, I would recommend that you obtain a temporary custody order.

Like OP, love my kids, but can't say the same about parenting. \n\nTo begin, it needs to be understood that there are many different kinds of parents out there. Some parents are highly conscientious, whereas for others, kids are akin to human pets. \n\nFrom my observation, it's the former that is most likely to hate the role as they tend to be responsible and prioritize the children in their lives. That means organizing their lives for the benefit of the children i.e. moving to family oriented suburban areas, more family or child oriented activities, focus on the overall wellbeing of the children across multiple dimensions - academic, physical, emotional, psychological, spiritual, etc., saving for the children's college and so on. \n\nFor the latter, the children are secondary to themselves. They're more of an appendage to their lives. The philosophy is, \"the children are not the priority, we are, the children are just along for the ride\". Less focus on the children's wellbeing across the aforementioned dimensions. These are likely to be the type of parents that do not reorganize their lives in any meaningful way for the benefit of the children.

This is especially the case if they cannot afford to 'offload' the child(ren) as previously described. \n\nIt's a 24/7/365 'job' that puts their life on hold for many years.

Corporations heavily marketed the benefits of the 401k and many people are still sold on it relative to pensions. Probably because the younger generation only knows about today's pensions and not the pensions that existed in the '70s and '80s. \n\nNot that workers had a say anyway. I was in the \"transition\" generation, as a result, I have three partial pensions and had three 401ks. \n\nMy first company simply told us that the 401k was being introduced, but no changes were being made to the pension. However, new employees were being onboarded without the pension plan. When enough employees had been convinced by a 3% match to start up a 401k, they announced the pension plan would be discontinued. Generally, it mostly impacted the younger workers and everyone else was grandfathered in. \n\nSince I had accepted a slightly lower starting salary for the pension benefit, and it was being discontinued, I left for another company that had a pension. \n\nAt the new company, pension and 401k were the norm. After a decade, they too announced that the pension plan would be eliminated. \n\nNew employees fared the worst. \n\nNot only did they not have any pension benefit, but the 401k match had been reduced, employee stock purchase benefit had been reduced, and to top it off, they were starting at lower starting salaries. \n\nI'm on my third pension system now (and 401k). If I had just begun with my current employer, I'd already be retired with 100% of my annual salary for life. \n\nWhat the younger generation doesn't realize is that these pensions systems have been changed from 20yrs to 30yrs to now 40yrs. And during that time, 401k match went from 6% to 3% to 0%. Discounted stock purchases went from 15% to 10% to 5% to 0%. Employer-covered healthcare went from 100% coverage to 90% to 80% to 70% or less now.

Their jobs back in those days covered:\n\n100% retirement (pension - 100% of final salary) 100% healthcare (no copays, deductibles, salary contributions, etc.) 100% tuition reimbursement 100% job security\n\nHomes were much more affordable as a percent of income. Almost every week I get to hear one of my coworkers brag that she bought her first home when she was 18.\n\nWhat the younger generation doesn't understand about that statement is that there was no credit reporting back then. You could easily get a full-time job with all the aforementioned benefits right out of High School. And with an average job, one could buy an average home and support a family.\n\nJobs were secure - layoffs only occurred in companies going bankrupt. An important fact when considering buying a home or alternative opportunities. A foundation grounded in secure employment ripples throughout all other decisions.\n\nAny sizeable company offered free lunch to its employees.\n\nOther things you don't hear much about were the annual holiday parties. These were lavish parties held by the companies for their employees every year.\n\nFree food, free drinks, etc.\n\nBack then, employees received training. No, not like today. They were literally trained for their jobs.\n\nToday, it's expected that you come into the company with all the skills necessary to be effective and productive from day 1.\n\nBack then, you joined the company - the skills didn't need to be a perfect match - and they would send you to be trained (1-3 months). You'd learn all about the tools, processes, organizational structure, etc. of the position.\n\nI know this because I lived it. I'm from the tail end of the boomer generation.\n\nAte 3 meals a day for free courtesy of my employer.\nAttended undergrad and grad school tuition-free (I actually made money).\nDid not pay or contribute to employer-provided healthcare back then.\nDid not have to contribute to a retirement plan back then (pensions).\nThese differences make the $75k back then very different than the $75k today. And I'm not talking about the time value of money, inflation, etc.\n\nAt every salary point, it was easier to support a family back then than it is today.\n\nMy mother retired from the United Nations. She only had a H.S. degree. That job today requires a specialized master's degree.\n\nMy father went to college for free - back when it was free to attend.\n\nBooks were not that expensive, used books were commonly used and many courses maintained multiple copies of the required textbooks in the library and could be checked out for the whole semester.\n\nBoth have 100% free healthcare for life. Both had pensions that pay 100% of their final salaries. They've been retired for more than 25 years (more years than they worked).\n\nMy father-in-law bought a NYC brownstone for $50k back when loans were approved simply through reference or holding what was considered a steady job. It's now valued at more than $3M.\n\nSpeaking of steady jobs. Layoffs were unheard of / uncommon. They only occurred (for the most part) when a company was going bankrupt.\n\nOnce upon a time, it was common for lawyers and doctors to graduate and shortly thereafter wipe out their student loan debt by declaring bankruptcy. They would then begin their high paying careers with large salaries and no debt.\n\nThe younger generation may not realize this, but...\n\nMany companies provided free meals to their employees. The last of those was JP Morgan (before it became JPM Chase). Sure, a few select companies like Google may do it now, but back then, if you were working for any sizeable employer, you had free lunch in the cafeteria.\n\nI worked for two such companies in the '80s.\n\nFree breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Free snacks. Free coffee all day. Lunch was an hour-long casual affair.\n\nFree dry cleaning. Free shoe-shine. Free onsite gym. Free onsite barber.\n\nFree onsite medical. 100% healthcare coverage.\n\n100% college tuition reimbursement. Not in a rush to go home? Wait until 6 pm (the earliest you could use the service) and take free car service home.\n\nHealthcare was 100% covered by the employer.

You often hear rent vs. mortgage comparisons - don't stop there, that's a half-truth. There's so much more to ownership than a mortgage. I'll focus on the downsides of home ownership because most of the arguments are for home ownership.\n\nHere's a few: real estate taxes, maintenance, repairs, utilities, insurance, HOA (depending on location), mello roos (CA), special assessments, house cleaner, gardener, pool cleaner (if it has a pool), add-ons (decks, patios, sheds), furnace, A/C, wiring, pest control, \"savings\", etc. the list really is longer than most owners let on - it's not called a money pit for nothing.\n\nOn the surface, when comparing by square footage, in many locations, owning will be less expensive than renting because you're getting more square footage by buying than you are by renting. Just check your local area and see what it costs to buy a 2,000 sq ft home vs renting the same square footage. You can use zillow as a proxy. \n\nHere's what's often not discussed. With more square footage comes greater utilities expense, house cleaning expenses, gardening, etc. but most important of all....TIME. \n\nYou'll find plenty of homeowners that don't place any value on their time - I've had neighbors that spend the entire weekend digging ditches, fixing irrigation pipes, buying and installing their own windows, doors, toilets, etc. and tell me that the repair only cost them $x for parts - they place no value on the 8+ hrs they spent doing the labor. \n\nSome people enjoy that. They love to garden or fix things and it's almost a hobby for them. Nothing wrong with that. But to others, those are chores that are not enjoyable. \n\nI paid off our home in 6 yrs. The value of the home increased significantly. It was reassessed (all the homes in our neighborhood were reassessed) and the taxes increased accordingly. Annual taxes that I used to pay correspond with 4 months of rent for me today. So you could make the argument that I'd get 8 months of 'rent-free' living annually by owning, but that's the whole picture.\n\nDuring the 2008 economic crisis 60% of my neighbors lost their homes (and the equity in them if they weren't upside down). With jobs gone and businesses bankrupt, there wasn't a simple way for them to recover. Like most of my neighbors, I too lost my job. Here is where a home is an advantage - if it's paid off, it's easiest to just pay the r.e. taxes and insurance (higher for ownership than renter's insurance) and let the home go into a state of disrepair until you land a job. \n\nMost new home owners underestimate home maintenance costs. My mother-in-law had to have her roof redone (NY home) at a cost of $40,000. My father had a newly built home (in FL) that needed a new roof after a hurricane $20,000. \n\nSo depending on where you buy, plan on flood insurance, earthquake insurance, etc. so plan on insurance riders. Many people assume the total cost will be covered by insurance though commonly it's not. \n\nWhole house A/C is great. Until it breaks and is beyond repair - it cost us $12,000 to get a new system in place.\n\nBig storms tend to knock down fences breaking the post. Fence repair is by linear footage and last one I had to do ran $3,000. My S.O. just had to do hers last year after a storm knocked down part of her fence - $2,500. \n\nAside from TIME - let's look at another variable - MOBILITY. Lost your job? Tired of living / working in your area? It's easier to move. \n\nDuring the 2008 crisis, a co-worker who'd also gotten laid off, let his lease expire, flew off to South America and Southeast Asia for almost 2yrs - living off his severance pay. Try that with a mortgage, homeowner's insurance, r.e. taxes, etc.\n\nThe reality is that the average homeowner will not be in the same home for 30+ years or even 20 years. I believe the average is 12-13yrs. In some places it's even less.\n\nMost homeowners 'trade up' - their starter home isn't good enough any longer and they move into neighborhoods that are more expensive with higher mortgage costs.\n\nSo yes, while your rent may go up (mine went down this past year), it's likely your housing costs will also go up as a function of trading up.\n\nWe haven't even begun to cover all the stuff that homeowners buy - from kitchen and bathroom remodels to loads of furniture. You'll find that a 2,000-3,000, 3-4BR home has a lot of empty space. \n\nYou'll buy significantly more furniture than you would otherwise. We had a whole living and dining room area that was completely furnished that we used maybe twice a year during Thanksgiving and/or Christmas.\n\nIn the 15 years we lived in that home, if we got 10 uses out of that space, I'd say that was a lot. \n\nWe had a guest bedroom. Used maybe a dozen times over those same 15 years. \n\nWe had a nice backyard. If you like to garden, you'll enjoy the space. Make sure to account for the costs of irrigation systems, floods from pipes breaking (pipe repair) in the winter, buying plants, fertilizer, etc. \n\nGarage doors - you'll want double springs - eventually a spring will break with one spring the door will remain open or closed depending on the position when it broke. With dual springs it'll still function normally while you find someone to repair it.\n\nPaint - houses need to be painted every 5-10 years (exterior / interior). This is thousands of dollars. Again, you could do it yourself for much less. \n\nTrees - sometimes you'll need to trim tree branches to keep them off neighbor's property. You may need a tree removed or the roots may encroach upon the home foundation and crack it. \n\nLawns - they need bi-weekly maintenance. A gardener runs $60-$100 a month around here. They need to be fertilized, aerated, watered, etc. (increasing your monthly water bill).\n\nHouse cleaning - we had a cleaning service $200/m. It was a team of 4 that would 'deep' clean the house once a month and do a light cleaning once a week. It would usually take them 4-5hrs to do the 2500 sq ft, 4BR, 2BA.\n\nPest control - during the summers we'd have an ant invasion so it a pest control service would come out and treat the entire exterior perimeter of the home. Different pests in different areas of the country from ants and roaches to scorpions (AZ) etc. Again, just add that to your annual costs. \n\n\"Savings\" - we \"saved\" quite a bit by installing solar panels, solatubes, specially insulated windows, energy efficient appliances, timers, etc., but all of that requires spending quite a bit of money which you'll recover \"over the long run\" if you're still in that home.\n\n\"Investment\" - yes, in some areas homes appreciate at a significant rate. In many areas of the country home prices are relatively flat. When compared to the U.S. stock market, they lag. \n\nI recall a conversation with my late ex-mother-in-law. She bought a brownstone for $50k in the '70s. It's estimated at $2.2M (before repairs of $400-500k - ex-father-in-law is an architect with industry contacts that can bring it in around $400k).\n\nI used the same figures that she provided to calculate S&P500 Index returns during the same timeframe. It was approximately double the return. \n\nWe excluded all the annual homeownership expenses (other than the necessary repairs required to sell it) which on average was approximately what rent would have cost her - granted, she would not be living in as large a space. \n\nHere's one that affects 50% of married Americans - divorce. A couple that rents can disentangle quicker than a home owning couple. With a lot invested into a home, it becomes yet another battleground during a divorce. Even during an amicable divorce where only one party wants the home, there are appraisals, valuations, fair market value calculations that include repairs, etc. that can extend the divorce process and lawyers aren't cheap. \n\nHere's another that affects some Americans - bankruptcy. If you have a $500k paid off home under your name and declare bankruptcy due to large debts resulting from job loss, long-term unemployment, medically unable to work, etc. you'll lose it. \n\nIf you have a $500k 401k, creditors can't touch it as it's protected by Federal law. \n\nToday, I rent. Would I buy a home again? Perhaps, but only under certain conditions - a great foreclosure opportunity or other economic distress and the property would have to be a net positive cash flow opportunity and most likely to rent it out and have that positive cash flow subsidize my living expenses. The same can be done with dividend paying stocks, but with real estate you'll have greater leverage. \n\nEven if I did buy a residential property again, at my age, it would never be under my name. I'd probably set it up under an LLC if a rental or under a trust if I lived in it. Under a trust, it's protected from creditors, divorce (if I ever got remarried), nursing home can't get to it making eligibility for Medicaid easier (provided it's been more than 5yrs since the r.e. transfer to the trust), avoids probate when I die, etc.", "created_utc": "1568867674.0", "edited": "False", "id": "f0qvwgb", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_d5vmly", "parent_id": "t3_d5vmly", "score": "4", "subreddit": "personalfinance", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qstm"}, {"author": "Cloud9", "body": "If they show poor judgment, that's enough for me.", "created_utc": "1568767112.0", "edited": "False", "id": "f0nde9z", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_d5fqnj", "parent_id": "t3_d5fqnj", "score": "2", "subreddit": "TrueOffMyChest", "subreddit_id": "t5_2yuqy"}, {"author": "Cloud9", "body": "> Food, clothing and shelter are obligations.\n\nTechnically, yes.

It wasn't a surprise to me. Much of what you've describing, I've lived through. Nights were especially difficult barely getting any sleep for years on end.\n\nIt's one of several reasons that my ex-wife left and pretty much gave up on the boys (also have a daughter). The amount of parenting work was significant. \n\nToday, my sons are 17 and 16. The difference in them between ten years ago and today is night and day. Here are some of the things I worked on with them.\n\n1. When they were very young, I took them to the swimming pool - a lot. In the water, they would physically tire out quicker and would be calmer and more receptive to my instructions.\n\nI had to train both to be able to look me in the eyes when talking with me. It was a very lengthy process.\n\n2. They both did much better under a very disciplined schedule. Every hour of their waking time was scheduled - 7 days a week. From wake up time to bedtime and 'sleeptime'. When they were very young the structure was in 15 minute increments. \n\n3. We played quite a few 'games' - one was the \"freeze\" game (see who could remain \"frozen\" the longest). We also played the \"silence\" game, the \"quiet\" game, the \"reading\" game, \"eating\" game, etc.\n\n4. I taught them to meditate. It calmed them. I also read to them every day - many of the books were to soothe, calm and reduce anxiety.\n\n5. Both took to Pokemon pretty quickly. I also had them work with clay, do origami, etc. for some autistic kids they respond well to tactile activities.\n\n6. After a while, I had them read stories to me (while I cooked, cleaned, etc.), but they had to do so calmly or \"story time\" was over and another activity would have to take its place.\n\nIt wasn't until their early teens that ABA services were engaged. In retrospect, I should have engaged ABA services earlier. For the past 3 or so years, they've been in therapy.\n\nToday, I can still keep them focused on their studies and the result is straight A's in all classes in the case of all 3 kids. They have friends (a handful) and it is not the hell it once was. \n\nThat being said, they still struggle with social situations. What comes naturally to a neuro-typical ie. recognizing facial expressions, sarcasm, double-entendre's etc. still goes over their head. \n\nAt times, I still have to tutor them in ambiguous concepts. \n\nI never used respite services even though I'm a single dad (full custody) with no family in the area. I had to take off from work for 5 years to dedicate myself to all 3 of my kids, but began working again last year given their ability to manage themselves now. \n\nThe progress for my oldest is such that even his doctors, when they see his medical records, have difficulty recognizing autism behaviors. Of course, much of this is just rote repetition and training and outward appearance, but it gets them by. My other son had other conditions in addition to autism, ADD, ODD, which make it much more difficult, but he too has improved dramatically across all 3 conditions. He no longer requires or takes the medication for ADD or any medication at all.\n\nWhile my response is focused on my sons because the topic is autism, it's imperative to make time for your non-autistic children. In many instances, my daughter didn't realize that many of the \"games\" we played were to help her brothers, so she was usually part of the treatment plan because I had no one else to pay attention to her while I helped her brothers.\n\nHowever, I did make separate time whether it was teaching her to cook in the kitchen or play soccer or go swimming. Sometimes, when all 3 were in school, I'd just take her out of school to have father-daughter time and we'd make a day of it. \n\nWhether it was teaching them to swim, bike, play soccer or other activities, I tried to weave in as much therapy techniques as I could. \n\nBoth group activities and 1x1 activities with each of the kids ensures that none of the kids are overlooked. \n\nNow that the kids are 17, 16 and 14 and are well-behaved, calm, \"normal\" kids w/friends is when all the family and even their mother - that bailed when help was needed, want back in to their lives. They're not very receptive having felt isolated all those years.\n\nA couple of years ago was the first time since 2006 (when the autism challenge began) that I took a 3 week vacation while they visited with their mother out of state. I spent much of it in the desert alone - clearing my mind, enjoying the silence and looking back at the journey and forward to the challenges yet to come.\n\nQuitting was not an option. Through the journey, I had my own MDD/GAD challenges. Some days I couldn't function at all, but we all made it through - together. Its had a lasting impression on all of them.\n\nIf you can, get help - ABA, respite services, family, friends, etc. - I would not recommend doing the journey alone, but if you're left with few options, just keep going one day at a time. It may seem endless and it's a decade plus journey with many more to come, but with every lesson they learn it's one less burden you have to carry.\n\nDo the best you can.

In fact, I think in many cases, your morality is deeply lacking if all you want is a child born but not a child fed, not a child educated, not a child housed. And why would I think that you don't? Because you don't want any tax money to go there. That's not pro-life. That's pro-birth. We need a much broader conversation on what the morality of pro-life is.\"\n\nChittister's position is not only informed by her faith, but also her academic experience: she's written over 50 books and has multiple degrees (including a doctorate).\n\nThe crux of Chittister's point is that there's a difference between advocating for birth and advocating for that child's entire life. If antiabortion proponents are truly \"pro-life,\" then those same legislators would not argue for defunding programs like those that provide school lunches or health care. Many who oppose abortion also oppose access to contraceptives. Antiabortion congressmen have consistently also advocated for defunding Planned Parenthood, which provides women with birth control options.\"", "created_utc": "1537931951.0", "edited": "False", "id": "e6ngo3q", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_9iugqh", "parent_id": "t1_e6n6nik", "score": "7", "subreddit": "LateStageCapitalism", "subreddit_id": "t5_39qgx"}, {"author": "Cloud9", "body": "We have a similar problem around here.

Their mom did the same - said it's not the life she signed up for, that they would never measure up to her expectations and that it was too hard and took off across the country. Their grandparents on both sides bailed for the same reasons.\n\nI made sure that I drilled it into their heads. The buck stops with me. As long as I'm alive they'll never have to worry.\n\nNow they're all teenagers. I spent years working with them - too many therapists to count. We're down to fine tuning now. One of the doctors commented that if it were not for (one of) my son's medical records / history and his specialization in this area, he would not be able to tell.\n\nMy other son is down to one day of therapy every other week and we only have about 18 months to go.\n\nThe difference between where they were almost 10 years ago and today, is drastic.

Your story can be boilerplate for the suburban neighborhood I lived in. \n\nThe timing might have been different in the case of my ex after 15+ yrs of marriage, but the story reads the same - caught her via GPS, pics, contacts, etc. on her iPhone that she didn't realize were being synched to the family computer. Long story.\n\nMy advice would be to head down to the courthouse and file for divorce. \n\n*Do not communicate via email or text with her - that will just add complexity. Keep discussions short and discuss like a business meeting with an agenda.\n\n*If she hires an attorney and you do not yet have one, require that they communicate with you in writing (this simple act put a stop to more than half of the games divorce attorneys play). Do not waste time in verbal discussions with them as nothing that they say, agree or promise to do has any legal weight. If it's not in writing, it's worthless.\n\n*Do not vacate the family home without a written legal agreement on child custody.\n\n*Gather all important documents - financial records, taxes, birth certificates, title to property, health and insurance records, etc. and get them on a USB drive or encrypt them and upload to a cloud service, mail copies to yourself at a friend's or relative's address. \n\n*If you're a gun owner, transfer ownership to a trusted relative. \n\n*If you drink or smoke, even if it's just an occasional beer or cigarette, stop. \n\n\nThese and other ordinary aspects of your life will be used against you to paint a false picture of you.\n\nFor example, my ex successfully obtained an order of protection based on false statements because I'm a U.S. Army Infantry veteran, gun owner, with 30+ years of martial arts. While I successfully defended against the order of protection, had I not done so, it would have been 7 years before I was allowed to see my kids. I could have lost 2nd amendment rights permanently. \n\nHer punishment for all the false accusations? None, zilch, nada. \n\nYou see, these are common divorce tactics that women are advised to deploy. Why? Because they work. For 2 months I was homeless (the order is granted until it's heard by the courts) without access to my kids, records, files, computer, home, car.\n\nThis gave her a 2 month head start on legal strategy, litigation tactics, brainwashing the kids with lies (Dad abandoned the family, he's never coming back, etc.). Additionally, I had limited access to financial accounts - gee, Dad is in violation of his fiduciary responsibilities because he hasn't paid all the bills - hard to do without access.\n\nYou can file the initial divorce paperwork yourself even if you end up hiring a lawyer afterwards. \n\nOnce filed, she has a limited amount of time to respond, so she'll have to start focusing on the time consuming divorce rather than sowing her oats.\n\nIt's not just trust that's gone. She no longer has any respect for you and every moment that you spend trying to salvage the marriage, for the perceived benefit of your child, will compound that loss of respect. \n\nI can relate to the sadness you feel for your daughter - I felt the same for our 3 kids. I too have a daughter. After 3+ yrs of her continuous litigation, our divorce was final.\n\nIn the end, I self-represented and retained full custody of our 3 kids. If you look at the statistics, it's a very low number of men that end up with full custody. Aim for full custody because it's likely you'll end up with less, either 50/50 or less than that.\n\nNow, I will warn you up front, your actions will need to be near flawless. The courts are heavily weighted in favor of mothers - they are given much more leeway than men. \n\nGiven what you've stated, it sounds like she has checked out in more ways than one. A mediated divorce or collaborative divorce may work for you, but neither worked in our case. Those approaches require both parties to be cooperative, responsible and accountable. A lot of wasted time and money was the result as she may not be in a hurry since you're probably the one working and she may be stay at home - what's the incentive when someone else is paying the bills and she gets to screw around?\n\nIn my case, I agreed to a date for the collaborative divorce and made it clear that if that meeting did not take place, I would go through the courts. Unlike mediation and collaboration, the courts cannot be ignored. \n\nAt no time should you even raise your voice in court. Speak calmly, logically, simply and choose your words carefully - every statement backed with evidence, supported by facts, case precedents and family law - leave your emotions outside. \n\nBest of luck to you. I hope it all works out for you and your daughter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "created_utc": "1536303331.0", "edited": "False", "id": "e5jkvw8", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_9dp121", "parent_id": "t3_9dp121", "score": "2", "subreddit": "relationship_advice", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r0cn"}, {"author": "Cloud9", "body": "I'll definitely be looking into it.

And lets say that one parent has full custody of that child and the other only has visitation. \n\nAssuming all else is equal, the software would calculate child support for the non-custodial parent at $400 per month (that represents both parents paying $400 for a total of $800/m). \n\nA single parent doesn't pay for the child's support. Both parents do. The custodial parent is already bearing the costs of support - children's clothes, food, healthcare, dental, vision, school supplies, etc. \n\nIn fact, if the custodial parent is bearing a greater support burden - as children's expenses increase as they get older - teens eat a lot more than when they were younger for example, then they can go back to court showing the increased expenses and depending on multiple factors, be awarded an increase in their child support from the non-custodial spouse. \n\nThe reality of child rearing is that the costs borne by the custodial parent almost always exceed the child support paid by the non-custodial parent. \n\n\n", "created_utc": "1531600327.0", "edited": "False", "id": "e2e5rgh", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_8y5dse", "parent_id": "t1_e2d63cp", "score": "1", "subreddit": "ProRevenge", "subreddit_id": "t5_2vjvl"}, {"author": "Cloud9", "body": "That's a perfect example of something that can raise questions. \n\nBank records show $5,000 withdrawal. Your receipt shows a painting bought for $X. \n\nNow you're called upon to produce the painting. You produce it and opposing counsel gets the court to have an appraisal performed. \n\nScenario 1: Painting is worth $5,000 - great. Now that asset will be divided by the court. \nScenario 2: Painting is worth $50 - great. Now you've called suspicion onto yourself and the barrage of questions begins. \n\nFunny you mention painting - in my own divorce, my lithographs were pre-marital property that her attorney tried to claim as marital property. Her attorney was shocked when I produced receipts that were 20+ years old. She exclaimed, \"Who the hell keeps receipts from 20 years ago?\" Judge: \"Apparently he does. Next matter.\"\n\nAlternative to your scenario: Spouse #1 goes shopping and spends $500 on shoes/clothes. Spouse #2 buys $500 pre-paid Visa card with credit card and has a drink at a bar. Comes home \"drunk\". Repeats the same every time Spouse #1 is spending on themselves - matching them dollar for dollar. Uses those funds to buy physical gold/silver coins through straw purchase and buries it. Name is not attached to the pre-paid card purchase of those coins through straw purchase. \n\nEvery time spouse #2 goes to get groceries - cash withdrawal $60 here, $80 there. When that divorce begins 3, 5, 10yrs later and financial disclosures take place. All the bank records show is a pair of shopaholics that can't manage their money.\n\nIf spouse #1 buys $500 shoes/handbags and spouse #2 buys $500 collectibles (art, coins, stamps, sports memorabilia, etc.) - spouse #2 is out of luck. Shoes are personal possessions, collectibles are assets that are divided (unless you can show they were pre-marital property).\n\nThe pre-paid card has no name attached to it. Easy to transfer. There are a dozen better ways, but the objective is always the same - to not leave a paper trail that ties your identity to any asset - decoupling as it were, in more ways than one.\n\nIf at any time, there is a transaction that attaches your name/identity to an asset of any kind - it can potentially make its appearance in court and if / when it does, the judge has wide discretion on how to divide the assets. \n\nIn CA, this can come back to haunt you even after the divorce has been finalized.

Additionally, I would intercept any inheritance she would receive and in the meantime, hire a commercial child support debt collection agency. \n\nOnce she realized she could not escape child support and that I would aggressively pursue it to for however long it took, she had a sudden turnaround and paid all the back child support (3 months) at once and hasn't been a day late since - I provide no grace period - the moment a payment is missed, I immediately initiate legal action. \n\nWhen she missed the very first day of child support, I knew I had to take immediate action because that would set the tone for the next 10+ years.

The grandfather was a bit of a hoarder, but not extreme and also collected a few things - stamps, coins, books, magazines, etc. \n\nWhen the grandfather died, his grandmother called all the relatives and gave them a chance to come and get what they wanted from the house before she started clearing out the rest of his things.  \n\nMy friend liked collecting 'artistic' items. He was a bit of an art fan and liked Andy Warhol among other artists. \n\nSo amongst the \"junk\" there were some old cans of Campbell's soup and he thought they would look nice with his Warhol print and took a couple of the cans and threw them in a bag along with some other items.  \n\nWe left and went back to his apartment and about a week later he put in place a floating shelf right below the Warhol print and placed the cans on the shelf.\n\nA year later his grandmother passed away and his parents and other relatives spent some time cleaning the place out and the relatives kept the coin and stamp collection, heirlooms, some China, vinyl records, etc. and donated, sold and threw away the rest.\n\nAbout a year after that, we're hanging out at his place and another friend asks where he got the old Campbell's soup cans. So as we're holding and admiring the condition of the cans, I notice that they don't feel like cans of soup, and I mention it, but Joey figures that his grandpa probably just collected them because he had several, even though Joey only took two of the cans. \n\nSo our mutual friend kiddingly says, \"check for a false bottom\" and we all chuckle. Then a few minutes later, he jokes, \"see if any part screws on or off\", again, we laugh. It's clear that those cans are completely and properly sealed. \n\nAnyway, we get distracted by the game on TV and we leave the cans on the shelf. \n\nAbout half a year later, I get a call from Joey that his place was broken into and his TV among other things are gone. So I go over to help him clean up the place. \n\nAt first I thought one of the cans was gone, but we end up finding it in the mess left behind. We clean up and sit on the couch having a beer.\n\nHe's bummed and doing some mental math on the replacement costs for items that were stolen and those that were damaged. It'll take a few thousand dollars to replace the items he's noticed missing thus far.\n\nSo I try to cheer him up a bit and say, \"At least you still have your intact art display\", but he tells me that one of the cans is damaged now, so I go get the can and sure enough, it's slightly dented on one edge, but it's hardly noticeable.\n\nSo we're there drinking and I start joking with him that the can is probably full of money and all he has to do to recover what he's lost is open the can.\n\nSo he says, \"may as well since it's ruined now\" and I joke that they probably stole his can opener. He realizes he hasn't checked to see what's missing in the kitchen so he goes there and everything seems to be in order. He comes back with the can opener and starts opening the can. \n\nAs he's 3/4ths of the way through, he says, \"hey, there's something in here, I see a white sheet of paper\" as the lid is fully open and he flips the can upside down on the coffee table, rolls of bills wrapped in a \"letter\" comes out of the can. \n\nWe can't believe it! There must be thousands of dollars in the can rolled in hundred dollar bills. We immediately realize that the other can may also have money in it and he goes to grab it and starts using the can opener.\n\nI ask him if I can read the \"letter\", he says, \"sure, suit yourself\", so I grab the \"letter\" and start reading. It's not really a letter, but just seemingly random words, \"wall plate, TV, brown dress shoes, wooden book cover, flashlight, lamp, armchair....\" and just as I was about to get to the end of the list, Joey, excitedly flips over the 2nd can and sure enough, more money and another \"letter\". So after a brief, momentary interruption, I get back to the final words in the list. At the end of this list was, \"...soup cans.\"\n\nThe second list had a few more details in it, like, \"stamps - wooden book cover\", etc. \n\nAfter Joey realized what had happened, he started calling his relatives to ask them if any of them had kept the book with a wooden cover, lamp, etc. basically, anything mentioned on those lists. \n\nOnly two items on those lists were in his relative's possession and both contained valuables. \n\nSo you may want to double and triple check everything before getting rid of it....\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "created_utc": "1527045781.0", "edited": "False", "id": "dzfboab", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_8lb74v", "parent_id": "t3_8lb74v", "score": "2", "subreddit": "minimalism", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r0z9"}, {"author": "Cloud9", "body": "The problem is, that much like a job interview, before marriage, people are on their best behavior; the red flags often don't show up until after marriage. \n\nSometimes immediately after marriage and other times years into the marriage. \n\n", "created_utc": "1526863942.0", "edited": "False", "id": "dzb5gaa", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_8ktbqe", "parent_id": "t3_8ktbqe", "score": "6", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i"}, {"author": "Cloud9", "body": "OP's question doesn't address the problem. \n\nLegality is bounded to a nation's jurisdiction.

Reddit is probably a younger crowd. Not many people mentioning hearing aids, meds, etc.\n\nNot sure that being a homeowner changes much. I owned apartments and houses from 1995-2016 and have 3 kids. Now we live in an apartment complex. All the apartments have washer/dryer/fridge/stove/microwave and access to gym/pool/jacuzzi (which are rarely used by any of the residents).\n\nThe only difference I noticed between homeowners living in houses vs. renters or apt./condo/townhouse owners is that homeowners in houses have a greater tendency to hoard and buy lots of things. My neighbors for example, had RVs, boats, jetskis, skis, snowboards, lots of sports gear - bicycles, weight lifting equipment, treadmills, etc. all rarely used. \n\nI distinctly recall which neighbors had pools built. The first year they got a lot of use - in the summer. Second year, half the previous year. By the third year they were rarely used. \n\nI opted for membership into the local Family Fitness which had a lot of activities for the kids and 3 pools - rather than building a pool in our backyard. And when they stopped wanting to go to the pool, I just canceled the membership. Meanwhile, my neighbors were still making payments on their $30-75k pools with zero use, not to mention the cost of heating, maintaining, cleaning, chemicals, etc.\n\nAnd after that, neighboring kids were wanting to be with all their friends in community pools that they had to pay for even when they had a perfectly good pool at home. \n\nThe community pools have slides, diving boards, dozens of their friends, classmates, concession stands, sprinklers, outdoor showers, etc. they're just more fun all around for the kids. \n\nI'd always needle my neighbors about it. I'd ask them when was the last time you used X. And invariable the answer was years if not decades. 2-3 car garages were filled to the brim with items they couldn't get rid of no matter how many garage sales they held. One in particular had a boat warehoused for a little over 10 years - paying monthly charges for storage and boat payments, etc. and using it maybe once or twice every other summer - if that. \n\nAnd every time they sold a house and bought a new one, they'd move all that stuff.\nThe kicker was when they could no longer get their cars into the garage and bought a new car that they wanted in the garage, they'd move all their stuff into a storage warehouse paying monthly storage for decades - most of which ended up in the landfill when they got tired of paying.\n\nWith young kids you'll have lots of items, but they'll outgrow that stuff. I digitized everything - their art work, photos, stuffed animal collection, car/train collection, etc. - all that stuff is long gone as they've outgrown it, but I can remind them about their favorite toys, blankets, friends, games, art, stuffed animals, etc. from the pictures I took. There are a few cars, trains, pokemon cards, stuffed animals, etc. in a small box that I kept for sentimental reasons b/c those were their favorites, but they call it the 'junk box'. They might feel differently if they have kids. \n\nThey're teenagers now so they rarely ask about any of that now except on family occassions like Thanksgiving or Christmas and then I'll bring up a photo or video on my iPhone or MacBook and they'll get a kick out of it. \n\n", "created_utc": "1526778167.0", "edited": "False", "id": "dz9guel", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_8k2jmx", "parent_id": "t1_dz8y88o", "score": "1", "subreddit": "minimalism", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r0z9"}, {"author": "Cloud9", "body": "Excluding shelter; food/water; clothes (jeans or Wolverine shorts, Ex Officio underwear, wool socks, polos).\n\n[Most people wear corrective lenses, but few even mention it.] \n\nThese are my daily use or carry items worth keeping:\n\nOn my person:\n1.

It's the design point of the system. Perhaps a simple example will help clarify. For a moment, lets imagine that all of humanity consists of 1000 people and 5 corporations.\n\n100 are minors going to school\n100 are elderly over 70 \n50 are under care due to terminal illness and \n100 are homeless \n\n650 are healthy, able-bodied working adults. 15 of those only make enough money for their bare subsistance and therefore, effectively pay no taxes (neither do the minors, the elderly, the terminally ill or the homeless).  \n\nThe first group consisting of minors, the elderly, the terminally ill and homeless will always exist - minors grow up and become adults which end up having kids that go to school. Adults age, become weaker later in life and many require care should they live long enough. The homeless are there for many reasons - mental health issues, addiction, etc. \n\nThe design point of any modern, CIVILIZED society (what we call civilization) is that the strong and able bodied contribute to the care of the weak unable to contribute - that's not to say they never contributed - the elderly over 70 were once workers, the terminally ill were once workers, the minors will become workers, and the homeless may likely have been workers at once point as well.\n\nThis is where taxes come in. To subsidize the needs of those groups. \n\nWhat people complain about is their total tax contribution. A few hundred (less than $1k) of a $50k salary is taxed for social programs. About $4k of $50k salary are taxes that go to corporate welfare. \n\nThis is where the tax system is broken. Under Eisenhower corporations paid ~90% in taxes and we had a booming economy.\n\nToday, corporations game the system so that profitable, multi-billion dollar companies, pay zero in taxes and often get back billions.\n\nIn capitalism theory, why should your taxes go to corporate oil subsidies? Why should you be subsidizing any \"pull-yourself-up-by-your-bootstraps\" corporation? Why should taxes go to bail out companies? To corporate welfare?\n\nIn theory, if a company is doing so poorly or is mismanaged to the point that it needs to be bailed out, then it needs to be shut down and companies that are stronger and better managed absorb that customer base.\n\nIn practice, weak, poorly run companies, whose executives continue to gut the company for their own personal gain through outsized executive compensation, bonuses, backdated stock options, etc. are bailed out perpetuating the problem. \n\nYou could make the argument that the 2008 bailouts were necessary to stabilize the markets. Ok, now the markets are stable. An orderly shutdown or break up of those companies can now take place.\n\nSo when discussing taxes and tax reduction, where we need to go is the diseased area of taxation - the corporate side of the equation where profitable, multi-billion dollar companies game the system.\n\nNot only is that where the problem is, but that's where more than 5X of our taxes go relative to what goes towards social programs - which by the way, is the design point of a civilized society - to care for its own citizens. \n\n", "created_utc": "1526230269.0", "edited": "False", "id": "dywzehc", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_8h14qm", "parent_id": "t1_dykvewv", "score": "1", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i"}, {"author": "Cloud9", "body": "He could have at least left a note.", "created_utc": "1525670455.0", "edited": "False", "id": "dykmi34", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_8hf7gs", "parent_id": "t1_dykm670", "score": "1", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i"}, {"author": "Cloud9", "body": "This is more than a decade ago.

Food/shelter courtesy of the US Army. Worked FT while attending college FT. Earned advanced degrees. Ended up working for a top 10 (at the time) Fortune 100 company. \n\nHad 18 months of \"emergency funds\", a paid off house, paid off cars, no mortgage, no student loans, no credit card debt, side business, rental property and financial accounts into the 7 figure range. We could have bought another house on the available credit in the HELOC. \n\nBut the story doesn't end there. Life goes on....\n\nAnd then.... 2008. Wave after wave of layoffs. I was caught in one of those waves a month after receiving a top rating and promotion. It didn't matter. The whole department was gone.\n\nFor 18 months spent 12-16hrs a day 'networking' with over 800 industry colleagues in my contact list. About 60% were similarly affected. \n\nOn the 18th month, after more than 5,000 applications, resumes, letters, emails, etc. landed a position paying 33% of my previous income. \n\nShortly thereafter, wife announced she wants a divorce, but we'd 'do it the right way for the kids'. \n\nI begin retraining into a healthcare career as it seems the only viable path for the area I live in. My ex did the same. So back to FT work and night school. She's a SAHM w/3 kids and going to school alternating schedules and juggling kids. \n\nWe had our kids when we were worth over a million dollars and no debts, but once you have kids, you can't put them back when the economy tanks. We could afford them just fine when we had them. \n\nThe side business tanked in 2009 along with more than 30,000 businesses in our area. Emergency fund gone. Expenses exceed income, but can't sell home. Fortunately, owned 2 rentals in NYC. Sold one. But given the downturn, proceeds were limited. \n\nNow we have student loans (retraining in healthcare for her 2nd degree, my 3rd). Two years later, she's almost finished pre-requisites and is admittted to a program pending remaining pre-reqs. For both of us, all our pre-reqs are 4.0 GPA since all the colleges in the area are impacted and that's what it takes to get into a program. Many students leave the state in order to get their license. We sell the remaining rental as r.e. market has come back somewhat. \n\nI'm admitted to a program pending completion of final set of pre-reqs. I fall ill, but continue attending. At this point something has to give - work, school, health, kids. With my health issues, I'm out of work a lot anyway as I'm in regular treatment. So I resign. And try to continue health treatments while attending graduate school. \n\nShe enters accelerated program - 15 months later she's a licensed RN. Half-way through her program, I begin mine. \n\nApproximately six months into my program, she takes off and files for divorce. Leaves the state permanently.\n\nI'm forced to take a 1yr leave of absence from program to care for my 3 kids (2 of which are autistic) after trying to coordinate almost a dozen babysitters around my 3 young kids schedules, my health treatments (and theirs), school and clinicals at the hospital.\n\nI'm served with motion after motion. Initially hire a divorce attorney, but that wasn't working out as he was churning the bills. My health deteriorates further. More frequent treatments as I care for the 3 kids, and self represent.\n\nThis spanned 4 years. No income during that time. Living off HELOC, credit cards, retirement accounts, student loans. Could barely function day to day for most of that time.\n\nLitigation raged during all this time. I tried re-entering the program, but half-way through the semester, I was buried with motions. So had to drop again. This happened again the following year. She would time the motions whenever I re-entered the program.\n\nCustody of kids was never an issue until judge issued support order and then she tried to obtain custody. In the end, after much litigation, I won full custody of all 3 of my kids. \n\nThe kids got older, became easier to take care of them. My health improved and only recently did I re-enter the workforce. \n\nBut what's left are 6 figure student loans. The house is gone in division of property as is half of retirement. No rental property. No business. Current job is about 50% of what I used to make before that 33% drop. All of it goes to living expenses for my kids and myself and servicing debt. \n\nI skipped a lot of the expenses in the story, but one was the annual COBRA of $12,000+ for our family during times of unemployment. \n\nLearned a lot over these past 10 years. \n\nNoticed that the financial gurus never seem to place much focus on putting aside the tens of thousands in legal fees that a divorce costs. Nor the $10k+ for COBRA. The lost income of falling ill in your prime working years when you have a family to support.\n\nMuch of the health issues mentioned are usually in the form of the healthcare costs in retirement (estimated at $250,000 out of pocket by some 'experts' - and that's with health insurance - Medicare and Part B).\n\nI wish you all the best of luck and I mean that sincerely.\n\n\n\n\n\n", "created_utc": "1525413771.0", "edited": "False", "id": "dyfcjfk", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_8gtr0p", "parent_id": "t1_dyf52wf", "score": "12", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i"}, {"author": "Cloud9", "body": "> \u201cno room for error\u201d generation\n\nThat's an apt description of multiple generations.

No access to the family home, vehicles, financial records, our children, nothing. During which time, she filed for divorce which restricts the use of accounts and her attorney attempted to lock me out completely financially. \n\nFor those unaware, in divorce proceedings, with some exceptions, you have 30 days to respond to motions or suffer a default judgement.

Only when the G20 or at least the largest and richest countries get together to put in place a Global agreement and perhaps even global taxation, will the bad behavior of the players cease. \n", "created_utc": "1521709648.0", "edited": "False", "id": "dw3h1ae", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_85rzq2", "parent_id": "t1_dw155c4", "score": "2", "subreddit": "LateStageCapitalism", "subreddit_id": "t5_39qgx"}, {"author": "Cloud9", "body": "If you think this is a new idea for them.......", "created_utc": "1521708528.0", "edited": "False", "id": "dw3glhx", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_85rzq2", "parent_id": "t1_dw189dm", "score": "1", "subreddit": "LateStageCapitalism", "subreddit_id": "t5_39qgx"}, {"author": "Cloud9", "body": "> You are saying people should be forced to give him their money or resources because he is old and doesn't have enough money to not be working.\n\nWe can suppose many things. He's 83, so lets go back in time. When he was 20 the year was 1955. I'm going to take a wild guess and say that there weren't too many opportunities for black people back then. The Civil Rights movement to secure legal rights for African Americans was from 1954 to 1968. \n\nLets suppose that at some point along the way, because you know, those pesky humans have to eat, he crossed the law and ended up with a record after doing a couple of years in prison for who knows what, maybe he stole, maybe he sold weed or cocaine to try to make a living. And since then he's been unhireable not too much demand for African Americans to begin with back then, much less one with a record. \n\nI doubt he was a millionaire who frivolously spent his money. But even if he was, and frivolously spent his money on alcohol because he was an alcoholic or gambler, because he was one or whatever you deem to be his \"moral failing\", in a just, civilized society, he wouldn't have to mow lawns at 83. \n\nAs for social capital, perhaps all those he knew are dead. It's not an unreasonable assumption that people around that age would be dead. Perhaps he never had children or his children disowned him because in his efforts to provide for them, he landed in prison due to the systemic racism of the time.\n\nI'm saying our taxpayer dollars subsidize big oil and dozens of other industries and hundreds of corporations. You know the type, the \"capitalist\" pull-yourself-up-by-your-own-bootstraps who are happy to be subsidized, bailed out, etc. at the expense of the taxpayer.\n\nIf there is anyone \"taking\" people's money, it's not the bottom of society where you need to be looking....\n\nThis conversation reminds me of an old joke.
