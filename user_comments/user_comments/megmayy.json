In January of 2015, I had a tonic clonic seizure while at work. I worked at a factory, so I smashed my face pretty good, and I knew something had to change. When I went to my neurologist, he didn't change my dose at all. He said \"we'll wait to see what happens\". Well, in 2015 and 2016 I began having night time seizures, and the absence seizures also continued. \n\nI began taking medical cannabis (CBD oil) in August 2016, as it is legal in my state; and I was seizure free for 5 months. On February 6th 2017, I had my worse episode yet. I was at work (an office job) and I had another seizure, but this time the seizures kept coming one after another and I had at least six in a row. I was experiencing Status Epilepticus and I had to be put into a medically induced coma so I wouldn't have brain damage.\n\nAlthough I was heavily sedated by Fentanyl, I remember waking up in the hospital with the breathing tube still in my throat; I immediately knew that I had had another seizure. I saw the date on the board in my room and realized that it was February 7th--I had lost a whole day.\n\nIt's been just over a month since this this incident, and I am now taking 3000mg of Keppra a day as well as 200mg of Dilantin. So far, things seem to be going really well as I haven't experienced any partial or tonic clonic seizures. I know that epilepsy is something that will always be with me. It will never go away, and I will never risk reducing my medication again.\n\nI really wish you the best of luck. I know that some people can successfully stop their medication, I just hope you don't have to go through the pain again. <3", "created_utc": "1490474119.0", "edited": "False", "id": "dfejlih", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_61dmha", "parent_id": "t3_61dmha", "score": "1", "subreddit": "Epilepsy", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s1h9"}, {"author": "megmayy", "body": "best song ever\n", "created_utc": "1490456586.0", "edited": "False", "id": "dfe7gh8", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_60uogj", "parent_id": "t3_60uogj", "score": "1", "subreddit": "PoliticalVideo", "subreddit_id": "t5_3arin"}, {"author": "megmayy", "body": "I guess mid-twenties, and you look very female to me by your face shape, eyes and hair.\n", "created_utc": "1490306966.0", "edited": "False", "id": "dfbqu12", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_60w2z2", "parent_id": "t3_60w2z2", "score": "1", "subreddit": "transpassing", "subreddit_id": "t5_2t5fu"}, {"author": "megmayy", "body": "So....did they reconstruct his dick?\n", "created_utc": "1490221708.0", "edited": "False", "id": "dfa64id", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_60umss", "parent_id": "t3_60umss", "score": "1", "subreddit": "history", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh53"}, {"author": "megmayy", "body": "So....did they reconstruct his dick too?", "created_utc": "1490221593.0", "edited": "False", "id": "dfa611i", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_60umss", "parent_id": "t3_60umss", "score": "1", "subreddit": "history", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh53"}, {"author": "megmayy", "body": "Try Zenni optical (a website) I got a good pair of glasses from them for really cheap!
