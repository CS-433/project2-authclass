Well, as a history buff from a country that's historically been harmed by Germany (Poland), I actually enjoy that Raiders takes place in the '30s, and that the bad guys are the Nazis. It's like a perefct concoction for me.\n\nNow, as for your complaints about the supernatural, you are kind if wrong abd ckearly missed the point. And I do not blame you, as I've seen the film dozens of times, and I only really got this some time ago.\n\nThere are actually a ton of messages throughout the film that indicate the Ark's power.\n\nPay attention to the following scenes (Spoilers ahead):\n1. During the meeting with the Army agents, Indiana shows them a picture of the Ark, depicting the havoc it can unleash. The leitmotif starts playing, and Marcus Brody says that the Ark is capable of levelling mountains and laying waste to entire regions.\n\n2. Around halfway into the film, the old imam says, \"This is a warning NOT to disturb the Ark of the Covenant\" before Indiana interrupts him.\n\n3. Belloq says, \"Jones, do you realize what the Ark is? It's a radio, a transmitter for speaking to God\".\n\nAs an atheist myself, the film is about a skeptic who has realized God's power is nothing to trifle with. Indiana was able to piece together all of these clues I've mentioned and figure out the Ark's power is tremendous. That's how he was able to tell Marion to shut her eyes. He finally understood all the clues about the Ark's power, and was able to save himself and his love thanks to that.\n\nSo you are free to disagree with me, but I think the supernatural stuff being left for the ending makes sense, as that's crucial to one of the story's arcs (Indiana turning from a skeptic into a man afraid of God).
