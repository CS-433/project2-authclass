You\u2019ll find a similar large immigrant populations in large cities with less and less the further out into the country you go, like you would in Sweden. People are generally friendly and are maybe more open to conversation than the stereotypical Swede, but more similarities than differences I\u2019d say. \n\nYou can find all those animals in Ontario. We have a lot of black bears here as well as moose and deer. Surprisingly one of the best places to see black bears is just at local dumps in cottage country. The bears like to go for a snack. Moose are kind of hard to come by and it\u2019s mostly luck. I\u2019ve seen 3 in all my years in Ontario and 2 were at the side of the road. If you go to the right places you can have a better chance of seeing them, but they\u2019re fairly elusive. I have also only seen wolves out west, but they do exist here. You\u2019ll mostly see coyotes around cities tho. Deer are pretty plentiful and their probably what you\u2019re most likely to see. Caribou and elk can be seen but their increasingly rare and you\u2019ll probably have to go way into the boondocks to have a good chance of seeing those. Also worth noting if you make it out west to Manitoba, sask or Alberta/eastern bc is there are bison there. I didn\u2019t expect that when I went out west. And they are way bigger than I expected. \n\nIn my opinion there are great parks all over the country. My top 3 are probably Gros Morne (east coast), grasslands (prairies), and Pukaskwa (northern Ontario) ntl parks. But the question is how far are you willing to go? 3, 5, or even 8 hours driving my seem like a lot, but on the scale of things in North America they\u2019re still pretty close by to Toronto. By contrast, if you want to drive to Yellowstone or the Rockies, you\u2019re looking more like 28-30 hours driving. 40 for Yosemite. One way. Which is \u00e9quivalant to driving from Paris to Moscow, so it obviously requires more planning and time off, but makes 3 hours seem like nothing. That being said, if you CAN make it out west I would 100% recommend it. The mountains and natural beauty out there are just on another level. \n\nSide note, I would also recommend you check out the Toronto islands. Not a stunning natural environment or anything, but one of the best skyline views in the country for sure. You can catch a ferry downtown to the island for like 6-7$.\n\nLmk if you have anymore questions.

Hamilton is a decent medium sized city with some rough edges. It\u2019s mostly post wwII brick homes and has a the feel of a typical rust-belt city. What makes Hamilton unique is the crazy number of beautiful waterfalls in and around town because it\u2019s built on the Niagara escarpment (locals call it the \u201cmountain\u201d).  \n\nAs for national parks near Toronto there are a few decent ones. There\u2019s a national park in Toronto called rouge River, although it\u2019s probably the shittiest national park in the country. It\u2019s basically just a city park. If you go a little further there\u2019s thousand islands national park about 3 hours east of Toronto which is beautiful but best seen from a boat of some kind. Then around 3 hours to the North west there\u2019s Bruce peninsula national park and the fathom five national marine park which have beautiful cliffs and stunningly blue water. You can take ferries out to the islands and there\u2019s a lot of fun to be had. Gets pretty touristy in the peak season tho. Point peele national park is four ours west, but it\u2019s also a bit more boring IMO. \n\nBeyond that you have some pretty cool provincial parks that are somewhat close, but the distances start getting bigger. Algonquin is a canoer\u2019s paradise and is 3ish hours from Toronto. Killarney is similar like 3 hours and is a good example of what mountains in Ontario look like. La cloche Provincial park is also cool but is a little further and more isolated. And if you feel like it Lake Superior provincial park IMO rivals most of our national parks, but is a butt numbing 8+ hours north of Toronto. Worth seeing though. There are tonnes of other smaller provincial parks but these are the ones that stick out to me as someone who has visited a lot", "created_utc": "1620480952.0", "edited": "False", "id": "gxdwm8r", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_n6xdj9", "parent_id": "t1_gxbnuaf", "score": "1", "subreddit": "EarthPorn", "subreddit_id": "t5_2sbq3"}, {"author": "069988244", "body": "Do yourself a favour and explore the country!

The sooner you figure that out, the sooner you can stop being offended by something as vague \u201ccancel culture\u201d. I\u2019m not telling you to accept any narrative, but I\u2019m telling you to open your mind up to the possibility that you\u2019re not as smart as you make yourself out to be, and that there are people who have different experiences in life to you. \n\nSome people suddenly not putting up with work-place racism and sexual harassment is a good thing. Less overtly stereotypical minority depiction is a good thing. Less systemic racism is a good thing. More police oversight is a good thing. Less innocent people killed is a good thing. Less acceptance of racism and sexism in society is a good thing. Do you disagree with any of these( because if you do then you honestly are a racist. Whether you like it or not. \n\nIs any of this making sense to you? This isn\u2019t a \u201cnarrative\u201d that you sheepishly suggest has some malicious narrative.

The reason why racial tensions SEEM so high right now is because of 3.5 years of the establishment in the US being if not more racist, at least more empowering to those racists. Wether you like it or not, Trump and his administration are a godsend for people with racist world-views because he helped normalized xenophobic thinking under the guise of being pro-America. \n\nI\u2019ve said it once and I\u2019ll say it again. The fact that black people use the n-word has nothing to do with AJ because they\u2019re totally different things. You can\u2019t decide that racism doesn\u2019t exist, and that no one can be offended by anything just because black people use a racist word that was pushed upon them amongst themselves. Honestly it\u2019s ridiculous that you even suggest this as a line of reasoning. \n\nThere\u2019s no point in dismissing a small issue just because bigger and unrelated issues exist. What kind of mindset is that? By that logic I shouldn\u2019t get my muffler fixed because my sister\u2019s car needs an oil change. Not really related at all, and also not my problem. The people making decisions about whether or not to keep AJ as a character aren\u2019t the ones who hold power to change the systemic issues in society, but that doesn\u2019t mean that they have to actively contribute to hurtful stereotypes. Because they ARE that. Maybe not to you, but they are. \n\nApplying this one thing that people weren\u2019t even that outraged over to the entire BLM movement is asinine, and you also have no reason to think BLM is behind any of this when they\u2019re very clearly about tackling large-scale issues. Just because some CEO or board of directors changed their fucking syrup bottle YOU get all outraged and claim cancel culture is pushing us close to authoritarianism. \n\nBLM doesn\u2019t have the final day in anything. Old white dudes and boards of directors who don\u2019t give a shit about black people are. That\u2019s the problem. The only reason the company \u201ccanceled\u201d itself is because they want to make a buck. How is that authoritarian at all? If they want to print syrup bottles with swastikas and realistic pictures of human shit they could. When I inevitably don\u2019t buy the bottle with excrement on it, have I fucking \u201ccancelled\u201d the brand? No! \n\nThese are very one sided issues. Either you\u2019ve seen it as problematic your whole life, but mostly just dealt with it, or you were oblivious to it being an issue in the first place. I\u2019ll let you guess which groups of people are more likely to have never thought about it. \n\nHonestly when you say things like \u201cracial tensions\u201d, \u201cblack-on-black crime\u201d, \u201ccancel culture\u201d, and \u201ccalling things racist=authoritarianism\u201d, it becomes painfully clear that the only source of information you consume is toxic right wing vitriol meant to pander to weak-minded white people who desperately want to feel oppressed by not being able to be racist anymore. And Reddit\u2019s \u201cmuh free-speech\u201d circle jerk has definitely pushed you further away from reality. If taking a racist characature off a plastic bottle is what offends you, you really are a snow flake. And if you can\u2019t understand why some people find issue with that, it\u2019s because of your own lack of historical knowledge, not some ignorance to the \u201creal issues\u201d you\u2019ve prescribed to black people.

It\u2019s an easily fixable, granted, small thing that can be fixed in a day. Nothing you mentioned can be fixed similarly easily. The only reason it gets so much press in the first place is because of backlash like this. \n\nAlso, I say it again. No one who speaks out about stuff like this thinks that this is the only or the most important issue facing black people. Most if not all are also against other more obvious forms of racism and discrimination at the same time. They\u2019re not mutually exclusive. Like I said, there\u2019s no reason why you can\u2019t think AJ is problematic while thinking education is beneficial to racialized communities. \n\nThe reason why mentioning black in black crime and education specifically gets people called racist, is because those exact talking points are used ad naseaum by very real, honest to god, racists. And their used in a way to minimize and de-legitimize the efforts of anti-racism movements. Which is effectively what you\u2019re doing here.

There\u2019s no reason why you can\u2019t think both, or all of these things are wrong, while also thinking aunt Jemima is based on a dated stereotype. \n\nThe reason why I think it may seem arbitrary to you is because at the end of the day it\u2019s still up to the company to change. If it were up to some, it would have been changed in the 60s, but ultimately it wasn\u2019t until the board chose to change it that it did.

It\u2019s essentially used as a dog-whistle to mean white lives matter.
