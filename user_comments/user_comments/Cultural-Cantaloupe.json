I've been working on Turkish for about 3 years now and let me tell you it is a rather difficult language. On the other hand, there are innumerably more resources for it than any other Turkic language - especially in English. If you speak Russian, that's a big plus if you can use their resources for other Turkic languages.\n\nIf you go with Turkish, the duolingo course is meh, especially compared to the German one. Do it nonetheless and supplement with [elon.io](https://elon.io) Been working my way through that and it's quite helpful. \n\nMy other bit of advice is not to make the same arrogant mistake as me and neglect listening practice. Of all the languages I've been exposed to, I find Turkish the most difficult to find the breaks between words.

However, fruit is highly variable in final clarity so it may be crystal clear then or might be a smoothy. Fine to drink either way. After fermentation you can bottle it and leave it for at least another month before its matured. Again, rough numbers here. More time will help it clear up.
