Does s/he have special knowledge of educating children on the autistic spectrum? Is it his class teacher? Does this pedagogist even meet this student everyday? I don't know how much you /need/ this job, but I hope you have the power to push back at this pedagogist and share your very real concerns. It seems like you are trying to push against the water which results in everybody having a bad time. It very much feels like teaching a blind man how to read instead of teaching him braille.\n\nIf I were you, I'd have a very open and honest conversation about (a) what are the true learning objectives of these sessions, and (b) the timeframe of his learning. He won't be learning at the speed of a student with no additional learning requirements (e.g. autism).\n\n>but she did say that I have do discipline him for basic things like hang his coat by himself, take the sheet music book out of the bag himself and so on...\n\nWhat is the purpose of these music lessons? Is it suggested by his pedagogist or his parents? Is it to teach him how to play the piano independently or is it to expose him to situations (e.g. listening, mimicking, waiting turns, making small amounts of eye contact). Is it so important for him to read music? Will he have a graded exam on his ability to set pieces? It's so important to set realistic goals.\n\nMoving forward, here are my general tips of teaching students with SEN (special educational needs)\n\n* There is a good chance they are more nervous and spiraling into the deep zones of despair than you are. There is a good chance that their educational experiences are most likely negative (e.g. being shouted at, being made fun of, not being able to do what everybody else can, feeling like a stupid piece of shit).\n   * As a result, take baby steps and get a feel of what is just right for him. Don't overload his cognitive abilities. If that means adapting your lessons and materials to make them simpler - so be it. Sight reading seems so unnecessary for his goals. It's difficult for anybody. Incorrect fingering and posture but he is getting it almost correct? That's fantastic! I'd say that the majority of your lessons would be making/giving him opportunities to succeed and receive praise! :D\n* Work to his strengths.\n   * What does he like? I'm sorry to presume, but for example if he likes Bluey (cartoon TV show) then can you make themed lessons and music about that TV show? Music is such an emotional tool and playing to his positive emotions might increase his attitude, motivation and ease up on his stress. Get this information from his caregivers (e.g. parents, family) and his pedagogist.\n   * Perhaps music theory, fingering, sightseeing, posture, etc. isn't what he was made on earth to do. But can he feel the music? Does he stim when he hears music he likes? Maybe he can 'feel' the music more than 'play' the music, if that makes sense.\n* Demonstrate, repeat, be patient, demonstrate, repeat\n   * A lot of teachers I know are a bit reluctant to give examples of the answer because it feels like cheating/giving them the answer. I don't know about you personally. But please feel free to demonstrate what you want him to do again and again. If he is looking away, perhaps it's too difficult or too much. Is it possible to break it down?\n* Give him breaks\n   * I don't know how big his cognitive load is, but this load is reduced with stress and anxiety. Let him relax for five minutes or so if you feel that he is having a negative reaction to too much. Maybe you could have a ten minute on, five minute off routine with him. In that off time, if he is okay to be relatively unsupervised, could you play some music on the piano and peak his curiosity/let him observe you?\n\nYou have done an amazing thing by coming here to ask for help. You are not trained in this, please do not feel bad if you cannot meet his needs! This isn't on you. You might also (if you haven't already) go to some autistic communities and ask them for their advice. I can imagine that a lot of educators (either for good or bad reasons) would give him the bare minimum.

There's too many answers to list here but possibly one of them is because school gives them negative feelings and video games are literally designed to make them happy. Can you be a teacher who doesn't give judgement and gives excitement, praise and hope? You might be one of the first teachers to get them excited for learning. A lot easier said I know, but maybe there is something in the classroom dynamics that can change.\n* Attention spans are limited these days (always?). Can you shorten activities and TTT? Can you break up grammar points?\n* Give them (fun) examples of what you expect them to produce. I can only imagine that you're using English to teach them English. I've always hated this and I've never found it useful in my own language learning. Make their cognitive load easier by showing them many fun examples of their target language. \n\nThis is what immediately comes to me without knowing more about your context.\n\nWith all said and done you have a context that needs accurate teaching practice and not a lot of time to get results. A lot of their results are not down to you, but previous teachers, the culture, parents, society and more.

This could be a task, pair, share activity that has groups debate, and then there can be a class debate at the end.\n\n**Collaboration and Media Creation:** Students need to choose, plan, and make a TikTok-esque video (all of this in English, even the planning).\n\nIf you feel like they wouldn't have the language to express stuff like planning (collab task), or answering hypothetical questions (extensive reading task), you can teach it to them after they've tried the task.

If it was fine the first time, make the task more difficult (e.g. add real life problems that would affect language output)\n\n**Feedback** \\- Ask and provide students feedback on their task - more positives than negatives(?!)

You don't yet have any famous entertainers (musicians, actors, gamers, artists, etc.) that have become well known in the west. When we do hear about you, it's in reference to negative news headlines and usually has clickbait titles (even the BBC, not trash-rag news outlets). Most of our news stories are about the US and UK, sometimes about Europe, and hardly ever anything else. Below are some examples of stupid news stories about Saudi Arabia that penetrated the west:\n   * Saudi Government bans rainbows (e.g. [CNN](https://edition.cnn.com/2022/06/19/middleeast/saudi-arabia-rainbow-colored-toys-ban-intl/index.html))    \n**Western Public View**: The Saudi government is actively banning and destroying all toys with a rainbow on them because it causes homosexuality. Colours cannot change a person's orientation but that's how idiotic they are being.\n   * Boy arrested for dancing in Saudi Arabia (e.g. [BBC](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-41019013))    \n**Western Public View:** The Saudi Police have arrested a poor innocent young boy for dancing in Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia is a cruel country where people can't even dance.\n   * Saudi Arabia & GCC warn/sue Netflix over breaking Islamic Values (e.g. [Yahoo](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/netflix-saudi-gulf-states-warn-191818548.html))    \n**Western Public View:** All Saudi Arabia and Muslims want to do is censor us. If you don't like it, go back home and don't use our media. When we want to change their culture (including human rights), we are called racists and bigots. When they want to change our culture, we bow down to them.\n* The news and far-right movements (e.g. politicians, governments) in the western world are either covertly or overtly anti-Islam. Either because it doesn't align with western morals or they use Islam as a mask to be more openly racist. Because of that, Saudi Arabia might take more flack.\n* British and American (English speaking countries in general) are pretty ignorant of anything outside of their own country. The exception to this is if there is a 8 part drama on Netflix about said country. I've seen a lot of people use the uses 'Muslim' and 'Brown' interchangeably. If you were to go to the average guy, show a picture of a Saudi and a picture of a Pakistani, they wouldn't be able to tell you the difference. The Middle East and then Pakistan and Afghanistan are pretty much culturally and politically the same to a lot of people. Their ignorance means even if something happens in another country, Saudi Arabia might get the blame.\n   * There was a funny/sad/worrying video of an old man shouting at a British-born Sikh guy (presumably with Indian heritage). The old man was shouting at him, telling him to go back to Saudi Arabia and that he can't treat women badly in the UK. The Sikh guy and his friends were just on the street doing nothing bad as far as I'm aware.\n\nLuckily, the world is getting smaller as communication and travel increases. I think this problem will sort itself out eventually on the path we are going to. As tourism increases in the country, the distant, unknown, and potentially dangerous Saudi Arabia will be known as a country for kind people, new cultures and experiences, and great food.", "created_utc": "1662618643.0", "edited": "1662623515.0", "id": "ink2tt5", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_x85w03", "parent_id": "t3_x85w03", "score": "21", "subreddit": "saudiarabia", "subreddit_id": "t5_2roj4"}, {"author": "Honeybeard", "body": "This is very true.

The coast cities (Jeddah and Dammam are the most \"open\" cities) whereas Riyadh is more down to earth and very large. The other cities/towns are quite small, not much to do, and perhaps more traditional thinking overall.\n* You need to find out early *who* would be paying for the compound. Hopefully the company but please make sure. You wouldn't want a nice tax-free salary and find out 50% of it goes towards just the rent. It might just be cheaper to find a family apartment building and rent from there. Also, not all compounds are western. A lot of them have people with executive jobs from Egypt, Syria, Jordan, etc. \n* If you can, learn to drive. You can't walk here, especially with kids. I get a lot of people expecting to walk/cycle everywhere because that's what we can do in our home countries. A housewife I know had to use taxis with her 3 kids (husband at work) to go to her hospital appointments, the park, the mall, etc. I can't imagine living here with kids and no car.\n* The hijab (headscarf) and abaya (long loose-fitted garment) isn't mandatory here for non-Saudis I think. Although most of my female friends really love the abaya. Just modest clothing. I imagine people would be especially patient with you if they see you out and about with 3 kids.\n* There is a large network of expat communities here. My family friends have all gone on to find other family groups to hang out with.\n* Behavior here is naturally different than in western countries. For you, you can expect it and tackle it as it comes. It isn't anything major. If your children are playing with Arab children, be prepared to be on standby and solve any problems that occur because of cultural misunderstandings. :) Again, nothing major, but the kids just don't have the foresight to predict this. \n* Something that a lot of newcomers seem to report as \"getting used to\" is the call to prayer. I don't know if you'd hear it on a compound. But you will naturally hear it 5 times a day, starting at 5amish. I sleep through it now and recently I think theyve made it a requirement to make them a bit quieter. \n* The people here are great, very patient with expat families I've found, and overall will be happy to help you. :)", "created_utc": "1659873932.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ijave9c", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_wic3hr", "parent_id": "t3_wic3hr", "score": "7", "subreddit": "saudiarabia", "subreddit_id": "t5_2roj4"}, {"author": "Honeybeard", "body": "Oh my goodness, thank you so much for writing all of this down.

Including:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* It often presents language in a very organised, structured, and bitesized way. The reality of language is that it is messy, chaotic, and often unpredictable. CBs fail the meet the goal of real language. When students are faced with real life language, often they don't have the skills needed to tackle it.\n* In addition to presenting language in digestable (but useless) chunks, the teachers, students, and the CB themselves will often assume that because it's \"been covered\" in a previous lesson, that it has been internalised. Often, what is the case, is that the student has a declarative knowledge of the language but it hasn't been internalised. Students blame themselves for the fault of bad teaching from both CB and teacher.\n* Textbooks often use a lesson planning called PPP (Present the language, Practice the language, and Produce the language). It is also the lesson planning taught on most short term teacher training courses (including the CELTA). Research shows that it's simply ineffective for the reasons in point number 2 above. However, it is very easy to package into a textbook. The current preferred lesson planning method by researchers is called TBT (Task Based Teaching) which focuses on the tasks that language needs and work their way backwards. \n* It often only presents a single interlocuter (a person speaking in a conversation) and rarely presents 2 (even rarer more than 2). Students who heavily rely (even with outside input) often find that they can understand the language, less so that they can produce it, and even less so that they can respond to unpredictable language and build communication together. I've seen high level students who often just want to speak in the class because they haven't learned how to respond. New teachers are fooled that they have a high level and thus they don't recieve further instruction.\n* They usually always rely on a synthetic syllabus:\n\n>Whereas synthetic syllabi use the target language grammatical system as their starting point for design, analytic syllabi start with the communicative purpose for which language is used. - [https://carla.umn.edu/lpd/modules/mod2/designing.html](https://carla.umn.edu/lpd/modules/mod2/designing.html)\n\nThe point of learning a new language is communication, whereas most textbooks focus on the language itself as a means to an end. \n\n* CBs often are boring which affects motivation. They have to be if they want to sell worldwide and it's their profit that they care about, not the students. In EFL, there is a famous acronym called PARSNIPS (Politics; Alcohol; Religion; Sex; Narcotics; \"isms\" e.g. sexism, feminism; Pork). CBs can not mention any of these real life activities if they want to sell to China, Saudi Arabia, even parts of Europe. Additionally, their activities are usually very dull so that they can be understood by everybody. As a result, motivation wanes off quickly.\n* CBs can also use harmful stereotypes in order to teach language. e.g. The rich people in the CB are white whereas the poor people are black; rich people are happier than poorer people; there's no mention of disabled people, people of colour, and other marginalised communities. Subconscious ideaologies of CB makers often translate onto the page and ignore real life people. One study I found looked into ESOL books (for refugees learning English in English speaking countries) - there were little mention of refugees in the book, and when they did \"exist\", they were often disadvantaged and unhappy in the text. There weren't any success stories to inspire them. The author noted that it could be seen that we are teaching refugees that white men are happier and richer, and refugees are usually unhappy and poorer.\n* CBs are often very generic and never specific. The goal of learning any language is to learn the language you will need in your life. However, CBs can only provide a limited amount of situations that probably aren't all relevent for students. Why, then, should students pay their hardearned time and money on learning language and situations that isn't useful?\n* There's actually more but I can't remember any of it now without looking it up.\n\nIn summary, CBs often serve their authors and publishers more than students. They are easy to sell as digestible, colourful, and linear. However, language is often not digestible and very much not linear. I'd wager from my experience that a small minority actually succeed using CBs. CBs are a relic of an older perception of what education should be that hasn't died off yet - an idea of \"chalk and talk\", the teacher has the language and will fill your empty glass up. It's an inaccurate way of thinking about second language learning. As for fixing all of this, additional CPD and teacher training should allow classrooms, teachers, and students to adapt real life language to the wants and needs of the students. The role of a teacher is not limited to teaching, it includes motivating, faciliating, presenting language, managing emotions, managing expectatons, guiding, and more. Education and more specifically second language education can be a very deep rabbit hole that, quite frankly, the CELTA or other teacher training courses don't even scratch the surface of.", "created_utc": "1657227582.0", "edited": "1657286811.0", "id": "if9a6vw", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_vtd5m4", "parent_id": "t3_vtd5m4", "score": "5", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "Honeybeard", "body": "Check this.

Here are my 2 cents:\n\n1) I fully agree with u/pixelboy1459 that your mantra should be \\[inability\\] + yet. I can't read **yet**. I can't remember them **yet**.\n\n2) I get the impression that you're in  your second semester from true beginner. That's about 5 months or so? Perhaps you and your teacher have too high expectations for the time inputted. Also, your teacher should (but perhaps s/he isn't) be well aware of what is expected from you at this stage. \n\n3) As another commentator said, traditional classrooms don't do well for languages. The ideal classroom would have the teacher create scenarios where you are breathing and living in the language. But perhaps your class is a very old fashioned and ineffectice textbook method. Sadly, textbook exercises aren't going to invoke communicative skills. \n\n4) Even if you're at the university with night classes and not a degree, see if they have anything to offer for you as a student. Perhaps have they a duty of care to students with additional needs. You say you aren't a student, but it seems you're a student of evening classes? It's a distinction I wouldn't mind.\n\n5) You say you are far behind everyone else in the class. Whereas I'm sure there are some high flyers in the class, are you sure you're the only one suffering? The problem with online classes and bad teacher management is that it's difficult to communicate with other students about studying. Part of a school's advantage is that the students can bond together to help each other. Do you have any sort of language learning community or are you all alone? the school and the teacher should be giving you every advantage that they can to help you, which include giving you a community to study with.\n\nGood luck, you are doing **much** better than you realise. :)", "created_utc": "1645455977.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hxu707j", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_sxrtit", "parent_id": "t3_sxrtit", "score": "1", "subreddit": "LearnJapanese", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qyls"}, {"author": "Honeybeard", "body": "Thank you for this reponse!!

My home country doesn't have the GPA system but I'm sure 2 years is still plenty to influence it. \\[edit: It's out of 4! Not 5! Wow, that's amazing - with time still to spare!)\n* You seem to have good English - could you improve it during your lifetime? Language learning is a life long journey, not just a 1 or 2 year goal, so if you can put yourself above the competition with excellent English and English communication skills, that might also help. Self-study, I think, would be sufficient for that. I'm talking about high level English communication skills, not just simply memorising grammar tables vocabulary lists. \n* A kind, patient, confident, charitable personality can put you lightyears ahead of candidates who show a lack of social skills. The CV will get you the interview, but a good connection made in the interview can get you a job or career.\n* I don't know if it's applicable in this country, but could you volunteer at companies that is in your field or interest? Volunteers can be used and abused (especially in America) - so, agree to stay there for a couple of months maximum for the opportunity to get some experience. Being a good volunteer over a month or two is like an extended interview period - they might hire you because of the connection you made. Even if they don't hire you, they might be more willing to help you in your job/career search. This is how I got kickstarted into my career 10 years ago. \n* Could you develop your skills in online courses - or even YouTube tutorials? I don't know what your major is. Moreover, could you learn a new skill? Learning a new skill not only gives you a new skill, but it will help your brain make connections in ways you can't imagine. \n\nI really admire your determination in this - good luck!

Get the students to discuss some pre-reading questions such what did she do? How old is she? Where is she from? etc.\n   * Tell them that the article they are doing to read will be about medicine, reproductive medicine, and family structures. Ask them to draw a mindmap of any vocabulary or situations they know.\n   * Read a few articles about the same subject and see:\n      * The registers of different articles\n      * Choice of vocabulary/grammar for the same subject\n      * Where their guesses correct or wrong about the woman\n      * Some general comprehension questions about the articles\n      * Why do the articles use the passive tense?\n   * Vocabulary about medicine, family structures\n   * Group discussions at the end of class\n      * What are the ethical implications of her actions? Were her actions ethical?\n      * What might have been her motives?\n      * Do you think she regrets what she did?

What difficulties or eases do they face? What will be the norm in another 50 years time? \n   * As you monitor their language together, identify emerging language and elaborate on it. Identify grammars that they are using incorrectly (as simple as possessive s to the third conditional)\n* There are many articles you can try this with.

Encourage them to watch it all in their own time. You probably need to show the video to them 2 or 3 times (maybe more) so already that's 15 minutes of the class.\n   * One TED Talk I like to utilise is How To Live to be over 100+ [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ff40YiMmVkU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ff40YiMmVkU)\n   * Along side a 4/5 minute clip, I supplement the video with articles and newspaper reports about the same topic.\n   * As above, create pre- and post-reading/video tasks. Activate their schemata with pictures, discussions, guessing from limited information, etc.\n\nI've just given you two examples of stories from authentic materials that you could use.

The CELTA doesn't end until you want it to end. Keep your notes, revise what you did, look at your teacher reflections, etc. Off the top of my head, I have found that the CELTA gave me constructive feedback about my teaching practice; clear classroom knowledge (STT/TTT, teaching vocab/grammar); types of lesson activities; and encouragement and ways to have CPD (continuous professional development). You can leave the CELTA learning 0% or learning a lot - it's really down to you. Doing a CELTA, unfortunately, does not guarantee you will be a decent teacher.\n\n>There also wasn't much about young learners, business or exam prep which is a big part of a lot of schools.\n\nThe CELTA is geared towards adults - the 'a' in CELTA is about adults.  It's a very general course, which you can expect for only a months worth of input. Like any craft, teaching takes years to learn and perfect. Specialisations take even longer. There is also a CELTYL (YL = Young Learners).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>And how do employers view the CELTA or CertTESOL, what do they expect from an employee?\n\nGenerally, it's seen as the industry standard in my experience. With the rise of internet TEFLs and a lack of regulation, the CELTA is one of the few TEFL qualifications that is regulated, which is valued by employers.\n\nWhat employers expect from employees depends on the job. It's a big world with a big variety in managers. Some might just want 6 hours of classroom teaching, some will try to be cheeky and get you to do more than you should. The interview is your chance to interview the employer, not the other way around. Ask detailed and thorough questions - they will usually respect you for it!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Is my experience with young learners pre-CELTA seen as worthwhile?\n\nIn short, yes. Put it in your total years of teaching. It depends on what job you will get next. If you are teaching in a nursery in Poland, it will be valued. Less valued, perhaps in an adult school in China.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>I figure if I'm planning on teaching long term I'm going to have to get experience with adults at some point if I want to continue progressing upward in the industry.\n\nSummer work is coming up, which is always popular in the TEFL world. In the UK, we have a lot of 0 hour contracts which lets you manage your working hours more flexibly if you want some practice. Usually, local governments will snatch up a free English teacher for refugee and foreign workers (volunteer).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf I were to give one piece of advice going from teaching YL to adults - you don't need as much classroom management or an authoritative presence.

The happiest times were at the end of the school day so I could go home to my bubble. The worst time was before bed - I had a deep and physical fear in my heart because I knew that the next day would be more work. I had no confidence in my teaching or my place in that society. It was beyond reason and all emotion. The first week, the manager said she would give me planning for my lessons, but in the end she put me in the class with 30 young children and a bunch of flashcards for six hours. I cannot express how mortified I felt. The first two weeks were probably some of the worst emotional feelings I've ever felt. I clung onto watching British TV clips on YouTube and American streamers on [Twitch.tv](https://Twitch.tv) just to feel at home. Even to this day, listening to a particular game's music makes me think of being in bed, slowly falling asleep to some guy on [Twitch.tv](https://Twitch.tv). I was alone and I didn't know where the shops were, I didn't have any friends, and I was texting my Dad every night saying that I am really thinking about coming home. I felt so vulnerable.\n\nAfter the year ended, I was sad to leave. I had made some good friends, learnt more about socialising and romance, learnt Spanish to a pre-intermediate level, created displays/curriculums. The only reason why I did leave was because the money was so poor, but I was tempted to stay.\n\nI came to Saudi Arabia 10 months ago and although I definitely felt more positive, I still found myself developing 'English language' habits to feel at home.

Here are my snippets:\n\n* I think your work experience will depend on your company. If the students pay, they will care about their learning. If they don't pay, they will care a lot less.\n* A lot of students will be persuasive and beg you to pass them if you failed them. Play hard ball - they might even respect you more for it. Even if they say that their dead mother will hate them forever, don't give it. \n* Work life is a lot more relaxed than other countries. If you are a semi-decent teacher, you will 99% be better than most teachers that they've had. Especially if you're teaching adults, be a friend, show them your culture, listen to their struggles, dreams, desires, and you will make a life long impression.\n* Drugs/alcohol/premarital sex is strictly illegal. You can find it if you really wanted - but if you're caught, it's a one way ticket back to your country out of your own pocket.\n* Although Islam is practiced here and is very obvious (prayers in the streets, at your work, the call to prayer on loud speaker 5 times a day including 5am, etc.), I don't think you'll find it imposed upon you. They will give you as much respect as you give them.\n* With that said, in my experience, I usually attracted three types of people: (1) somebody who wanted to use me as a free teacher/speaking practice without being interested in me, (2) somebody who wanted to convert me to Islam because it gets them more reward with Allah, or (3) a genuine person. I'm never hostile to any of these people, but my WhatsApp usually receives a message from the first two types of people every week.\n* Perhaps like in far eastern countries, people won't be shy once they get to know you. Overweight? They'll tell you to your face. Not married? \"Brother, you should really consider getting married, you're 28 now, think about your future children\". \n* 95% of the people I've met here have been lovely. I don't see myself leaving anytime soon. The 5% of people are people who are overly homophobic, talk openly about their hate for Israel, call me an American Idiot because America bombed the Middle East, and say that I don't deserve a job because I'm not Saudi. However, whenever I experience that 5%, the other people I'm with call them out on it. The general vibe I get in Jeddah is \"live and let live\" despite religion/politics/etc.\n* I'm never bored, but it doesn't take much to entertain me I suppose. I read, go to the beach, go to cafes/restaurants (pretty cheap), watch movies/YouTube, do extra work, learn Arabic, chat/play with friends on Playstation or with coffee. I don't get much time to be bored. I hate going to malls - too loud for me.\n* You will work almost exclusively with men. As such, conversations may get sexual, egotistical, and generally like an all-boys club. I just nod, laugh, and if they ask my opinion, I give it. My work place at the moment is obsessed with talking about gay sex recently.\n* If you're a woman, you don't need to wear a hijab. You would need to wear an abaya, which covers you from the neck downwards. There's plenty of expats here with their hair on show.\n* You won't be expected to partake in religious ceremonies (except Ramadhan during work hours, I think. You can drink in private I suppose. Although, my work hours in Ramadhan were specifically after fasting stopped because that's when students wanted to study). Although I have some advice: (1) never step in front of a Muslim praying (one meter or less) - this invalidates their prayers. (2) Never step on the prayer mat with your shoes. Take your shoes off. It's a clean place. (3) If they ask for your opinion on religion, freely give it. However, I wouldn't advise anybody to be evangelical about their faith or lack thereof in any work or social place. Even if you strongly disagree, just don't say anything, or don't go to Saudi. \n* Please give the students speaking time. Let your students explore your lessons on their terms, don't just talk with them for an hour. They've had that in their English education their entire lives. Even if they ask you a question, pose it to them or the class first. \n* Be positive, even with the smallest things. Although Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and Arabic are some of the most different languages to English (therefore making it very difficult to learn as a second language), Saudi Arabia also has generally quite a poor education system. Their own native literacy may not be good, let alone their second language literacy. If they struggle to say the world 'create' instead of 'Kuwait', give them a big smile and say 'Fantastic'. Positivity and encouragement will go a long way in motivation because I think Arab learners are some of the most disadvantaged to learn English. It can look like a behemoth, and you are their teacher, their cheerleader, their confidant, and their friend. Be the language teacher that you wish you had.\n* Students will often give you a lot/too much respect. Part of the Saudi culture. If they do, break down barriers. Insist they call you by your name (and not just Teacher or Teacher Mike). The more they trust you and relax, the more they'll learn. \n* You'll get invited to a lot of weddings. Enjoy the big feasts, swords dancing, and coffee. You can even wear a thobe (long male Arab garment) if you fancy. \n\nThat's all I can think of. Enjoy the experience. The more you put into Saudi Arabia, the more it will give you.

He got a pass.\n\nI'm not saying you can't fail, but I feel that you intentionally need to try to fail.\n\nHowever, I feel from your post that you need something more than just cold hard logic.\n\nThe CELTA is difficult because the content might be new or because it's such a big workload in just four weeks. It takes over your life and it's a lot to learn and adjust to within a very short time. By the end, I felt like a new man and I was sad that it was over. I wanted to go back because life was so slow afterwards.\n\nMy advice: talk to your tutors about it. Say how you feel and they will understand. Mental health and TEFL is increasingly becoming more important. When I say mental health, I mean everything from the 'big ones' like bipolar and schizophrenia to more everyday ones such as anxiety and self-loathing. Talk about it, accept it, evaluate it with another person. It will help your CELTA, your teaching career, and working abroad. Talk about the problems you mentioned here such as\n\n* wasted money\n* boyfriend feeling let down\n* family feeling let down\n\nLastly, I think the CELTA affects most people negatively. I learnt to skip lunch because the teaching practice made me so nervous that I'd fart constantly throughout and feel sick. Another woman, married, 2 kids, worked in government, cried every week because of the CELTA. In general, people were stressed.

It's common, don't worry.\n\nMy first piece of advice is to email/message/phone everybody you know who could find you a job. I got my first job because my CELTA tutor had received an email that week from her friend saying that they needed more teachers in a small school in Spain. It was plain luck. Email tutors, friends, your CELTA colleagues.\n\nMy second piece of advice is to keep applying. What websites are you using? I've only used [TEFL.com](https://TEFL.com) but [http://www.eslcafe.com/](http://www.eslcafe.com/) also exists as well as many others upon a Google search. Apply for 5 jobs a day and then relax. r/tesoljobs also exists. Hell, make a post in an appropriate subreddit saying that you're looking for a job. Either in this one or another one. There's no rules against it.\n\nMy third piece of advice is not to be too picky about where you go. You might have your heart set on France, but perhaps Brazil is a better fit. Saying that, don't accept a job where **you** need to pay them or where you feel your life might be in danger. I've had some friends who only search for Korean jobs and I think experience in another country who be better than being unemployed for a period of time. Look local as well. This will broaden your job hunt and give you **less** unemployed time and **more** employed time to brag about on your CV and in interviews.\n\nMy fourth piece of advice is to consider doing some volunteer teaching work in the meantime. This will broaden (a) give you more confidence, (b) keep those CELTA principles in your head and active, and (c) tell your future employer that you do have experience. I did a master's last year full time, I also taught part time - my employer was more impressed and happy that I had recent experience than a bloody master's degree in this field. Employers love experience. It gives them confidence (rightfully or wrongfully). Make them confident in YOU!\n\nAs I said before though, for every 30 applications, I got around 1 interview.

There's usually plenty of explanations that you can draw upon from various websites that can help you. \n\nThis question can be quite problematic because it can easily promote negative female stereotypes, it can easily introduce a topic that is inappropriate, and it needs to be tackled differently depending on the context.

Also, if I were you, I'd write down a context that you want to teach in the future because it will help you give a more helpful answer rather than a generic one. A generic one can lead to many different criticisms such as \"why didn't you consider the Muslims in your class?\" or \"if this was a woman in Brazil she might have felt uncomfortable\". \n\nI'm going to give you my context: I'm a single male, 28 years old, in Saudi Arabia.

I ask the student, who is the better wife for me? He/they discuss that they both have advantages and potential disadvantages depending on their preference. I then ask, **\"who is a better catch? - who is the woman who is better for me as a wife?\"**. The students respond that they prefer woman X because Y.

This is based on 90 mins of teaching time.\n\n* Find a video/podcast/whatever and find it's central theme, e.g. holidaying/politics/the future, etc. before the class.\n* \\[10-15 mins\\] Introduce the class to this central theme and let them develop ideas between themselves by asking very generic questions about the topic\n   * e.g. what kind holidays do you prefer? where is your dream destination? what are some holidays you would hate to go on? are holidays essential for people or just a luxury? what is the attitude to holidays in your country now and what WAS the attitude to holidays 100 years ago?\n* \\[10-15 mins\\] Pre-teach the vocabulary of the podcast you're going to listen to. This includes less common words as well as technical words. If you find that there are a lot of new words in this podcast, then perhaps it is too difficult for your students. 10-12 new words is a number I find works well.\n   * Pre-teach them through an exploration task, don't just tell them what it means. For example, the classic \"10 words on the left, 10 definitions on the right, match them up\" and let them work by themselves, then self correct in a group.\n   * Or, have 10 words around the room on the tables or walls. Let them stand up, walk around, and write what they think the meaning is next to the word. Discuss as a class why they think it's this definition. Then, present 10 definitions, and let them match them up. This provides more student discussion time as well as allowing students to exercise their current knowledge and better understand the gap between their current understanding and the true definitions.\n* \\[5 mins\\] Introduce the podcast and the general theme of the podcast. Explain that you're going to listen to it (nothing too long! attention will fade fast after 5 mins) and give them the title. Let them discuss and guess between themselves what will appear in the podcast. \n* \\[10-15 mins, assuming a 5 min podcast clip\\] Tell them to listen to the podcast for general gist. No writing, no talking, no pauses. After, discuss with a partner what they remember hearing. After, class discussion about what happened in the podcast.\n* \\[10-15 mins\\] They will listen again but now they can make short notes. Tell them explicitly not to write word for word, but notes. Class discussion after about what was spoken about.\n* \\[10 mins\\] Give them a transcription of the podcast clip and let them listen to it again as they read. They can make notes on the paper about new vocabulary or new ideas. Make the text double spaced to allow them to write easier. A final discussion about the topic of this task. Also, a discussion about how they felt about listening to podcasts and their listening skills in general.\n* 15 minute wiggle room for technical errors/natural extended discussion/additional questions/etc.", "created_utc": "1530898456.0", "edited": "False", "id": "e1wiahc", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_8witpd", "parent_id": "t3_8witpd", "score": "5", "subreddit": "TEFL", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qq76"}, {"author": "Honeybeard", "body": "My salary has been delayed every month since I've worked it.

They are great speakers but usually shit teachers. I say this myself as a native teacher. They understand how they know the language, but they don't understand (a) modern educational concepts around second language learning, (b) how learners approach Arabic, and (c) what to and what not to teach at any one point.*\n* *Also be wary about teacher's qualifications: they might have a degree in English language or Arabic language from a university, but this* ***isn't*** *a teaching qualification. It's a linguistics qualification.*\n* *Lastly, be pushy with your teachers. You're paying them money to help you in a short time period. If you don't understand, say so. Slow them down and say \"sorry, I don't understand\" or \"you didn't teach me about this type of grammar\". Even if you don't know the difference between a verb and an adverb, and the teacher assumes that you do, slow them down and make them do their job. Again, I say this as a second language teacher.

This isn't a language you can squeeze inbetween your current activities. Know your motivation and keep referring to it to keep at it.\n\n*My advice: You can also create some sort of physical rememberance of your motivation.* \n\n* *Make a collage of pictures of the reasons why you want to learn (speaking with people from a different culture, yourself in a new country, the joy of understanding foreign texts, people being impressed with your language skills).*\n* *Write down why you want to learn Arabic: this can be a bullet point, a poem, a story, anything.*\n* *Record yourself on Instagram or short videos speaking Arabic. This will improve your speaking and also you will see that you are slowly improving.*\n\n*You will have physical and personal references to your motivation. Don't rely on your brain which often forgets and often seeks pleasure in the short term.*\n\n**Tip 2: Choose a dialect**\n\nLearn formal (Fusha) as it is known everywhere, then choose one dialect alongside formal. Don't learn 5 dialects. Base the dialect on where you want to go. If you don't want to go anywhere, just learn formal.\n\n*My advice: I agree. I would perhaps say that if you want to learn Arabic then you probably want to understand something more than the news or text: perhaps internet communication or just Arabic in your city. If you don't have a specific dialect to learn, choose Egyptian as it is widely known.*\n\n**Tip 3: Utilise YouTube**\n\nRecommendations: **:** Esraosh Osh (Gulf/Kuwaiti Arabic), Spoken Arabic Simplified (Levant dialect), Hanan AlFardan (Emirati dialect), Arabic Lessons with Nada. There are a lot of free resources on YouTube.\n\n*My advice: Everyvody's favourite,  LearnArabicwithMaha, is also a great choice.*\n\n**Tip 4: Keep a record of everything you learn**\n\nUse Flashcards to understand and record your progress. In the beginning, vocab is key.\n\n*My advice: Memrise and Anki are fantastic, especially as they have premade flashcards for you to use with a nice interface.*\n\n**Tip 5: Develop fluency by getting an online teacher**\n\nYouTube/Books/etc. only get you so far, getting a native speaker will help you even further. You can also join his Patreon to get access to his help and advice.\n\n*My advice:* \n\n* *Be very careful with native speakers. They are great speakers but usually shit teachers. I say this myself as a native teacher. They understand how they know the language, but they don't understand (a) modern educational concepts around second language learning, (b) how learners approach Arabic, and (c) what to and what not to teach at any one point.* \n* *Also be wary about teacher's qualifications: they might have a degree in English language or Arabic language from a university, but this* ***isn't*** *a teaching qualification. It's a linguistics qualification.* \n* *Lastly, be pushy with your teachers. You're paying them money to help you in a short time period. If you don't understand, say so. Slow them down and say \"sorry, I don't understand\" or \"you didn't teach me about this type of grammar\". Even if you don't know the difference between a verb and an adverb, and the teacher assumes that you do, slow them down and make them do their job. Again, I say this as a second language teacher. In the long run, it helps you as a student and them as a second language teacher.*", "created_utc": "1529422599.0", "edited": "False", "id": "e0xm7dl", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_8s8z00", "parent_id": "t3_8s8z00", "score": "8", "subreddit": "learn_arabic", "subreddit_id": "t5_2v4vi"}, {"author": "Honeybeard", "body": "Haha, I hope you want me to be in Riyadh for good reasons! :)\n\nEverybody in Jeddah says that Jeddah is better than Riyadh.

I was told people go to Dubai to have fun on the weekends.\n\nI'm 28, white British, with no previous Arab experience and this is my first time outside of Europe. I live and work in Jeddah. I love it here. It's relaxed, friendly, and there are things to do. I spend my time on the cornishe (the beach), at cafes/restaurants (much cheaper than the UK), working on my job/studying Arabic, or at home playing video games/on the internet (with or without friends). That's pretty much my full week, I don't get a lot of free time to myself. Life is here perfect for me. I don't drink, so I don't miss alcohol. I'm trying to think of what I \\*can\\* do in Manchester which I \\*can't\\* do here in Jeddah, here's a list:\n\n* Go to a pub (cafes are the pubs on Jeddah, which do everything the same plus shisha but without a relaxing pint of beer).\n* Go to a bar (shisha bars are probably the closest, although I don't smoke. Loud music, pretty colours, exciting atmosphere).\n* Go to a club (I'm 28 now and to be honest, it wasn't enjoyable when I was 18-25 let alone now)\n* Museums/Art Galleries - I think there might be a few here about history? In Manchester we have a science one, a nature one, a history one. Also, people here generally don't want to spend their free time in a learning environment here, unless it's to improve their English.\n* Cinema - \"oh Saudi is finally getting cinemas!!\" yeah well, at \u00a320+ a ticket, you won't see me in one. Saudi custom traditionally is to stream movies at home with friends and I'd much rather do that.\n\nAs u/xanthemivak said, Saudi isn't as dystopian as people make it out to be. Even in the smaller villages/towns, the guys are relaxed and chill. The people in my work watch Game of Thrones (nudity, sex, murder, more?), Vikings (sex, sex, sex, murder, sex), and more. I don't watch that, it makes me blush sometimes. I've never been to Dubai, but imo I haven't come to this part of the world to try and find a western catered place. If you really want to find women, it's possible. Dating apps work here and there are women of many nationalities. Facebook has plenty of expat groups also.\n\n\\> Also is it true that you can't be seen publically with a girl as I am a Muslim?\n\nI can only speak for Jeddah. Women and men here walk together all the time. I think they are usually brother and sister, but I've never heard of a case where people have been asked to prove that they are related/single. I would advise not to hold hands or hug in public. Other people can comment for other regions.\n\nOverall, Saudi is a Muslim country. Some might say it is \\*the\\* Muslim country. You hear the call to prayer often (more often than not on people's phones), some people wear thobes, the way that people interact and communicate is very Arab, etc. However, there is little distaste for the west in my experience. A lot of the music/film/TV/news here is western and in English. I sometimes advocate for a less English/American atmosphere here in Jeddah, I don't like how people want to go to American restaurants all the time and listen to English music. No - I want to sit on the floor and eat khabsa with my hands with some old cringy Arab music from the 80s in the background thanks.

So I am from Manchester and I graduated from a master's last year. I also now work in the Middle East where I teach Middle Eastern students about English \\(general and academic\\). Manchester Uni is the best uni in Manchester and it has many resources for you to improve your English and academic practices.\n\nFor your Academic English, the first thing I can recommend is [http://www.phrasebank.manchester.ac.uk/](http://www.phrasebank.manchester.ac.uk/). This is used by natives and non\\-natives alike. It gives you a lot of academic language to use in papers for a variety of reasons. You can find the different sections on the left and at the top. The University \\*should\\* also give you a lot of extra classes for writing critically, giving presentations, and other academic practices. I advise you to email them \\( [study@manchester.ac.uk](mailto:study@manchester.ac.uk) \\) and ask them what help academically you will get, and if they have anything you can do now. The university website also has information about all of their postgraduate courses: [https://www.ceas.manchester.ac.uk/](https://www.ceas.manchester.ac.uk/) or [http://www.eee.manchester.ac.uk/](http://www.eee.manchester.ac.uk/)? I don't know which one applies to you. Look at the main website [www.manchester.ac.uk](https://www.manchester.ac.uk) and use the search function to find your course.\n\nI also advise you to go to the Student's Union. It's a company within the university that is only for students. They give help for social events, academic help, and anything other questions you have. [https://manchesterstudentsunion.com/](https://manchesterstudentsunion.com/) \\- This is their website. I advise you to get to know it well. The Student's Union also has a LOT of social clubs such as sports \\(football, archery, rock climbing, walking, etc.\\), religion, ethnicity \\(Pakistani, Arab, Chinese, etc.\\), interests \\(anime, gaming, etc.\\) and more.\n\nAlthough I'm biased, and I'm a bit bored of living 25\\+ years there, but Manchester is one of the best cities in the UK. It has a unique culture and atmosphere and it is very diverse. Arabs, South Asians, Africans, Christians, Muslims, Buddhists, tall, short, conservative, liberal, the list goes on. I had many Arab friends last year during my master's degree and they all flourished here, even with the demands of a master's degree. Some of them stuck only with their Arab friends and shisha bars/Arab restaurants. Some of them tried to ignore fellow Arabs and made international/native friends to improve their English and have new experiences.\n\nHere are two tourism websites for Manchester as well: they show a lot of the attractions and restaurants. If you want some home food or something new, Manchester is sure to accomodate: [https://www.visitmanchester.com/](https://www.visitmanchester.com/) and [https://www.tripadvisor.com/Tourism\\-g187069\\-Manchester\\_Greater\\_Manchester\\_England\\-Vacations.html](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Tourism-g187069-Manchester_Greater_Manchester_England-Vacations.html).\n\nSome general advice:\n\n* don't go out at night alone, take a friend or a few friends. I know some friends who have sadly been mugged at night :\\( Moreover, if you are out, don't use your phone or show anything expensive. This is basic knowledge for me as a Mancunian, but for a foreigner you might not think that. Hide your phone, hide your expensive watch.\n* Also, it's very cold and wet. Manchester is probably of the cities that rains the most because of the geography. Take warm clothes and waterproof clothes. It's probably cheaper in your country than in England country.\n* Get to know English prices if you can. We have a 20&#37; tax here on everything as far as I know. [Tesco.com](https://Tesco.com) is a popular supermarket whereas [Primark.com](https://Primark.com) is a popular clothing store. Look at their prices and get to know how much you need.\n* The first week or two weeks I think will be the hardest for you: get to know where the masjid is \\(if you're religious\\) because it will have a lot of friends who will be more than happy to help you. Also, get to know where the shops and takeaways are. I did my master's degree thesis on Arabs coming to the UK to study at university, and my results found that all my participants stuggled for the first couple of weeks. I want to help you avoid that by making friends in the local masjid and making friends in your accomodation.\n* Try NOT to live with 18 year olds. Generally, they are very messy, smelly, they smoke inside, they don't clean, they party inside \\(until 3am/4am\\), and you will either love it or hate it. If you have university accomodation, get the Post\\-Graduate accomodation. I lived with undergraduates last year and it tested my patience a lot.\n* Shops are also open for a short time on Sunday, usually from 10am to 4pm \\- that's the law here. So many Arabs don't think of Sunday as the weekend and go to the shops at 6pm and they are closed.\n\nI have two friends who I think can help you further. One is my friend from Jordan who has just finished his master's degree. He got a first and he is the loveliest guy I know. Another is a Pakistani friend who is currently now doing a master's degree in Mechanical Engineering at Coventry University. If you want to speak to either of them for advice, PM me and I can give you their whatsapp.\n\nOverall, you will love it. :\\)", "created_utc": "1522750429.0", "edited": "False", "id": "dwq0ifg", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_899vm0", "parent_id": "t3_899vm0", "score": "6", "subreddit": "AskAcademia", "subreddit_id": "t5_2sakj"}, {"author": "Honeybeard", "body": "I didn't even know this was a thing :\\( ", "created_utc": "1522748748.0", "edited": "False", "id": "dwpzq5q", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_899yh4", "parent_id": "t3_899yh4", "score": "2", "subreddit": "learn_arabic", "subreddit_id": "t5_2v4vi"}, {"author": "Honeybeard", "body": "I use Memrise.

If somebody asks for the truth, I will politely and tactfully state it. However, I feel in some countries these white lies/lies/omissions are simply more culturally acceptable. Especially in Saudi \\(and perhaps Chinese\\) society where a level of politeness and courteous behaviour is somewhat foundational. Locals might understand when and where there are lies, whereas I used to take stuff at face value.\n\n2\\) TEFL teachers have a bad reputation: We come, we usually teach poorly, we might be lazier than local workers, we might be culturally insensitive, and occasionally we disregard contracts and leave whenever we want because we know that they aren't/can't legally prosecute us. Perhaps even more. Managers and owners of schools need to be protective and vigilant of their students and income, and perhaps rightfully so.

Nearly all of Arabic language workbooks begin with the alphabet and give you simple words that everybody knows.\n\nSecondly, I advise to learn a dialect alongside MSA until it no longer feels beneficial. The first vocabulary, phrases, grammars, and sounds will be universal across all Arab dialects. Again, there's no fret to choose now for the rest of your life. For me personally, I have an interest in both formal (\u0627\u0644\u0641\u0635\u062d\u0649 alfus\u02e4\u0127a) and colloquial. \n\nRegarding sounds, don't be afraid to use your throat. There are two 'H' sounds, two K sounds, two D sounds, and so on - one from the tongue and one from the throat. In English, it's rude to use your throat to talk but it's encouraged in Arabic. In Arabic, these two sounds are seen as completely different and distinct. \n\nSubreddits: /r/learn_arabic and /r/arabs - actively or passively use them to get more of an idea about the language, culture, current issues, strategies, etc. Also, look at the 'top of all time' in /r/learn_arabic for some resources. \n\nBooks: https://www.amazon.com/Mastering-Arabic-Palgrave-Master-Languages/dp/1137380446 This is what I use. It combines vocabulary with learning the letters in a nice way. So that you aren't bombarded with learning the alphabet at once.\n\nArabic users are big on social media as well.

I agree with this to an extent but the academics recognise this also. Attempts to bridge the gap between teachers and academia have been made such as TESOLacademic.com which invites academics to discuss their research on a YouTube video. However, in my opinion, the videos are usually of poor quality. https://scottthornbury.wordpress.com/ provides an A to Z of ELT (English language teaching) which refers to personal experience and research. Social Media is also being used to increase teacher development, such as the #ELTchat, but again the advice on there is usually more anecdotal than scientific. \n\nIt's a difficult situation, perhaps similar in other applied academic positions, because the TESOL industry is not regulated at all. Jobs outside of native speaking countries want native speaking teachers, and these teachers typically lack experience, qualifications, and basic knowledge of pedagogy and linguistics (they won't know the difference between past simple and present perfect, for example, let alone how to teach it). Moreover, TEFL is used by many as a temporary 'live-abroad' job. On top of the poor wages, the high demand of schools, some teachers don't feel motivated to wage through the free journals of TESOL. Moreover, the high level language and terminology is simply less accessible for the average teacher. Even more so, managers of schools may not provide training. In my school, I've been to two training days about how to sell to customers instead of teacher training. \n\nThere does seem to be a few academic-teachers that bridge the gap. David Thornbury, David Crystal, and Jim Scrivener come to mind. and have YouTube videos/presentations. Also, the typical TESOL conferences also bridge the gap fairly well. The biggest conference, IATEFL, is a mixture of academic research presentations, paid advertisement presentations, and some self-congratulatory back patting. \n\nAll in all though, I want to improve my teaching skills. However, when I finish work at 10pm, I need to eat, learn Arabic, exercise, and relax my mind. I feel reluctant sometimes to risk skimming a few free articles in the hopes that they provide implications for the classroom.

I just had a look on the BBC website, because they have a lot of educational programs and games for young children, but I couldn't find anything. \n\nIf it's within your control, perhaps try to have different areas within the nursery that the children can approach and do in their own time. For example, a colouring the letter table, and a tracing the letter table, and a time with magnets of letters and small CVC (consonant-vowel-consonant, like C A T, cat) words they can make. You know your learners and their habits better than me - just a suggestion. \n\nYou can also look on google for phonics games and phonics youtube videos.

Religion is definitely more of an identity there than it is in western countries and different religions may have different laws in the same country (e.g. a person whose ID card says Muslim may be warned by the police if they are found to be drinking alcohol, an Arab Christian would not be warned).

When you think of what most identifies you, you might consider your gender, your age, or your nationality. The Arab regions also considers religion as a prominent identity.  I have had Arabs repeatedly ask me \"what's your religion?\" or \"I'm Muslim, what are you?\" - there's an assumption that all people are religious. It's as much as an identity as your age or gender.\n\nOn an additional note, whereas Christianity  and Islam are generally well respected in the Muslim regions (even Judaism to an extent), you may find that less respect is given towards polytheistic religions, and even less respect or shock is given for atheism.

In my experience, white lies are part and parcel of the culture. Both arabs do it and expats do it. There's a social decorum that the region likes to uphold, even at the expense of telling small lies. Again, this is a value that you will either have to stick with or compromise on.

For instance, a white person with a standard English accent who is handsome with no qualifications might get a job in Japan over a black person with a qualification and a non-typical accent. At times, employers don't want a teacher as much as they want a role model of a country to be conversational with their students. Of course, there are definitely exceptions. I'm telling you this because you should not have an expectation that everything is fair in this industry; additionally be very careful about which job you accept and which job descriptions you believe. In one job in Spain, I was promised that I would be given accommodation with an another teacher and that my holidays and bills would be paid. Instead I lived with a Spanish woman, her one year old baby (loud), and her dog (even louder and smellier) and I was not paid holidays or bills. You might think that the natural answer would be to go to the government and complain, but if you can't speak the language and you are a foreigner, you might not get the treatment you think you would expect or deserve. Working abroad, especially in cultures different from your own, will not give you the same rights as your home country. To some employers (I wouldn't know the percentage), you might only be a white face who speaks English who entertains children - anybody can do that. I might seem like I am demonising employers, but it is the market overall that is like this. A lot of research has been put into discrimination in TEFL work places but hardly any into unacceptable behaviour by TEFL teachers. For instance, if a teacher didn't like their job abroad, they could just move back home and leave the employer with no options but to run a struggling business. It works both ways, but please be canny.\n\nLeading onto this, Japan is a very popular country for obvious reasons. Perhaps consider extending your job prospects to Korea or another far eastern country (even Korea is becoming oversaturated as far as I know). A year or two in Korea, or another far-eastern country, might show employers that you are trustworthy in a far eastern country. \n\nIn the meantime, get some experience at home. Phone up your local council and see if you can offer free classes for local people or refugees - you can dress this up better on your C.V and it will help considerably with your teaching practice and confidence as a teacher. \n\nLastly, look at some British or North American j-vloggers on YouTube.

I only understood the game after playing the tutorial and doing research online. Some might think that it is absurd that a game could be so unintuitive that you need to do research online to learn how to play it. This is different from other genres, let's say fighting or sports games, where players research online for strategy guides and combos, but never need to be introduced to the base mechanics of a game via research or a tutorial. The base gameplay of a fighting game is inherently intuitive. A health bar reacts immediately to sound and visual cues, the main buttons of a controller pad changes the movement of the character, and there is usually a introduction of \"Round 1, FIGHT!\" which is reminiscent of a non-video game sport, boxing. \n\nI am always hesitant, however, to force tutorials on players. Nobody enjoys tutorials: they are usually condescending, poorly paced, and overall frustrating. I played a tutorial for Gears of War 4 recently and I was texting at the same time as the level of challenge was nothing.\n\nI think about the genre of MOBA though, and my experiences with other MOBAs. As far as I know they all give an optional tutorial, but offer it when the game first plays. With League of Legends, my first MOBA game, I got to play as an easy character, Ashe, and was told the foundations of the game. I didn't find it *as* frustrating because it was my first exposure to the genre. I didn't know how to attack, use skills, what the objectives are, or how to interact with minions. Later on in my League life, I have watched and read probably days, if not weeks, of YouTube videos and online guides for the game.\n\nReflecting on Gigantic, I think a similar model of actively offering the tutorial to new players would work well. Although MOBA is a growing genre, I would guess that it isn't a prominent one in the games market. Equally, this game has unique mechanics which has led a veteran MOBA player like myself  to not understand the game fully. In contrast, the transition from LoL to HotS was relatively painless.\n\nLastly, it is worth noting how *who* the player base is also. Specifically for the Xbox 1, I would hypothesis that the playerbase have recently got their Xbox from either Black Friday or Christmas and have downloaded the game Gigantic as it is promoted on the XB store and it's free to play. In that alone, a lot of new players to Gigantic and MOBAs will be playing now, lowering the skill cap. Additionally, as the game being easily accessible on Xbox user can play it. That means that a twelve year old boy can play as well as you or I.

Last year I taught abroad, this year I'm doing a masters in Language, Linguistics, and TESOL, and next year I hope to either do a PhD in something similar or work in an Arab country.

In a similar fashion, just as many Pakistani Muslims (i.e. non Arabic speaking) in the UK study the Quran to recite and read it, I have found that they cannot speak MSA almost at all beyond what is typically found in prayer. Even with the similarities between their native language Urdu, many of my Pakistani Muslim friends have visited Pakistan for a number of months to formally study Quranic language and yet I can speak better MSA than they can now. My point being, as I would equally advise an English learner, as the OP wants to learn either MSA or a dialect beyond YouTube videos on other online content, the three most prominent ways are to (a) get a reputable textbook and work through it, (b) use language technology (e.g. apps, websites) to connect with native speakers worldwide, practice, and make plenty of mistakes, and (c) attend classes.

The Quran is written in Classical Arabic.  \n2.Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) is the literary variety of Arabic used in writing and in most formal speech. It is fairly similar to Classical Arabic; most Arabic speakers think of them as two registers of the same language (fu\u1e63\u1e25\u00e1 al-\u02bba\u1e63r and fu\u1e63\u1e25\u00e1 al-tur\u0101th). MSA omits some classical grammatical constructs, has a stricter word order, uses a simpler numeral system, and obviously includes some more recently coined or borrowed words.  \n3.Colloquial Arabic refers to the many national or regional varieties of spoken Arabic. These differ significantly from MSA and Classical Arabic, as well as from each other; some are mutually unintelligible and therefore considered different languages by many linguists. They are usually unwritten.\n\nThe link under Classical Arabic points to the [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_Arabic) that comments, \"Classical Arabic (CA), also known as Quranic Arabic or occasionally Mudari Arabic, is the form of the Arabic language used in literary texts from Umayyad and Abbasid times (7th to 9th centuries).\"\n\nIf this is wrong then please educate me.\n\nI think that I make the distinction because in English literature there is a definitive change of tone between modern literature and Victorian literature, for example. Additionally the language used by Shakespeare in his writings is usually colloquially known as \"Old English\" which changes vocabulary and some grammar. Additionally, I would never encourage any Christian to use the King James Version of the Bible as it was written and published in the 17th Century; it does not use modern English whatsoever. All of Victorian literature, Shakespearian literature, and the King James Bible are written in English, but in different variants of English. That is not to say, however, that I as an native English speaker cannot comprehend them, however certainly Victorian literature is difficult to read and some Shakespearian literature is impossible to understand solely from my language.

You won't be \"teaching\" your baby from birth a language, you will be simply exposing them to the language and allowing their developmental language system (be that the Language Acquisition Device, Generative Grammar, etc.) find the connections. To expose your child to the language, find a Japanese neighbourhood and enroll them in the local nursery, find a Mosque and take your child to the non-Muslim outreach programs, go to the Italian food shop and ask the owner directly where he hangs out because you want your child to acquire the language. If they are foreigners in your country, they will usually be flattered. More specifically, make life long social connections with parents in the target language and allow the children to socialize, and equally socialize with their parents.\n\nI remember reading [citation needed] that it is difficult to force a language upon a child by a non-native parent, as when communication breaks out (e.g. how do you say \"fuck off you piece of shit\" during an argument in the target language, or if the child wants to flatter you they would use your native language to ensure you understand better) one would revert to English. The only way to solve this, I assume, would be to completely ban English from the household, which is a lot easier said than done. \n\nAll in all, you aren't going to teach your child so much as you're going to expose them.
