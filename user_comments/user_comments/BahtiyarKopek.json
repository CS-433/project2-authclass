I think another factor is the Latin alphabet reform that contributed to this.\n\n>Is there not any movement in Turkey right now, or ever, to \"claim\" Rumi as an Ottoman poet as well?\n\nWait so, I mixed up the empires. Rumi lived in Anatolian Seljuk Empire, which was the predecessor to the Ottoman Empire, which didn't exist back then. Anyways, I don't think there is a conscious movement per se to claim him as *Turkish*, but if you asked the average Turk on the street, they would probably answer that Rumi was Turkish and wrote in Turkish. He's nestled in the public's regard as Anatolian, and that brings up another issue. Nationalities and ethnicities weren't really on the front page of people's identities in the Seljuk or Ottoman Empires. They were Ottoman/Muslim first, then Turk/Arab/Persian second.\n\n>I am very surprised that Turkish literature before the 1900s is not even taught in high schools and are barely known to literature professors. Is this still because of fallout from Republican reforms? Is there also no push for Ottoman literature to be taught?\n\nAt least when I was in high school ~15 years ago, we didn't study any Ottoman/Seljuk material. The only thing I remember is the names of writers and poets, especially from the Tulip Period. They just expected us to memorize certain names, \"the first to write a play\" or matching author names with works. We never studied the works themselves. Everything I saw was from the Republic literature. People today are introduced to these works only through chance or if there's a drama adaptation of it on tv. I'm pretty sure it was because of the Republic and its executioners, they didn't just change the government method, they scorch-earthed it and left a fallout as you said. Until as late as 90s history books negatively represented anything before the Republic, especially towards the end of the Ottoman Empire. It was nothing but \"traitor\" discourse and millions of people still have this look towards the past. I don't know what they teach in schools these days. I skimmed the abstract section of a few articles in Turkish from the past few years on the subject and they're still advocating for it to be put in the curriculums, so I guess not much has changed.

But it doesn't mean there isn't any. Ottoman literary school was heavily Persian-oriented both because of Great Seljuk Empire's heritage and Persian literature being regarded as highest in the region, so most Ottoman writers/poets wrote in Persian. Using Turkish wasn't a custom until much later. But there has been hundreds of writers/poets in the Ottoman Empire, many of them famous throughout the whole ME region. Several Ottoman sultans wrote poems with aliases and their works are among those studied in Turkish literature departments in universities. Ottoman art also had a bloom in the 1700s during the Tulip Period. Majority of the literary material known today survive from the era. Also you mentioned \"Persia has Rumi.\" Yeah, he was born Persian, wrote in Persian as was custom, but also spent the last 45 years of his 66 year-long life and wrote his masterpiece in the Ottoman Empire, influenced the literary and religious consciousness greatly.

First your receptive skills develop (1-reading, 2-listening), then your productive skills (3-writing, 4-speaking). It's normal to feel eager to speak even at the most basic level but you can't expect to start speaking before your reception is fully developed. For example, with regards to English, hundreds of millions of people worldwide are in this \"I can understand, but can't speak\" phase and they think it's bad that they can do one but not the other. It's a source of embarrasment and it breaks motivation. But that's what everybody goes through in the acquisition process, and if you're in that phase that means you're on the right track. You've come a long way, but you still have a lot to go.\n\nSo you need to determine how good your receptive skills are, and improve them to a point where you understand at least ~80% of what you read or hear when you're watching something, or when someone's speaking. If you understand less than half, you still need to improve. You can do that by watching movies/tv shows with Turkish subs, and looking up the words you don't know. Listening to songs and trying to write down the lyrics as you go, and then looking up the actual lyrics. Watching random news coverages in Turkish, as those generally have the most formal and clear languages. Following Turkish social media platforms and trying to decipher random posts. Basically improve your reading and listening first and your vocabulary, grammar, pronunciation (sub-skills) develop with them. Writing and speaking comes after all these are at a decent level, especially speaking. At a certain point you'll notice that you're much better at talking with people through texting or messaging, but you struggle at face-to-face speaking.

But I don't believe for a second that Chuck meant that remark, he knows perfectly well what will hurt Jimmy to hear the most. Chuck's like a father to him, his idol, his anchor, that's why those words would cut the deepest. He knew it and wanted to really hurt Jimmy at that moment. There's just too much sibling rivalry, jealousy, and alienation between them that the core feelings are unreachable. The tiny flashback scene where Chuck is reading that book to Jimmy in the tent, that scene is special. It's like the spinning top scene in *Inception*, it's a distant, barely rememberable memory, but that's what ties everything in their relationship together.", "created_utc": "1653757145.0", "edited": "False", "id": "iabxdrm", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_uzij22", "parent_id": "t1_iabccqz", "score": "3", "subreddit": "betterCallSaul", "subreddit_id": "t5_2u05j"}, {"author": "BahtiyarKopek", "body": "Oh, I just saw your edit. All good. You're entitled to your opinion of course, it just came off a little harsh lol. I mean, of course it could just be plain filler dialogue. After all this is just a TV show for more or less general audience, but I'd say there are lesser media out there where writers copy-paste and create hundreds of episodes. It's obvious that some thought went into the writing and the production of this show.\n\nThe thing is, in modern art and literature authors very rarely include something in the product for no purpose. Symbolism has been loaded on much smaller, more insignificant things, even on artworks thousands of years old. You can write volumes on just the color of an item that appears for a few seconds, or a momentary expression, a hand gesture. And then there's the death of the author issue, where *even if* the author didn't intend anything by it, it could and does mean something, because it's the product of the author's unconscious and it gets its meaning without the author's knowing. It's actually quite impossible to create a product that has no meaning whatsoever.

I think it's implied that the song he plays then was among the records they stole. Original is \"R.B Blues\" by Ruth Brown, and it got replaced with, as far as I can find out, literally a royalty-free song, [here](https://www.smartsound.com/royalty-free-music/Blues/Just+Blues/Way+Too+Late+Blues/). I don't know if it was royalty-free in the 90s but I guess that's the cheapest the producers can go, right?\n\nIn 3.6 opening scene, \"La Donna \u00e8 Mobile\" by Pavarotti (performer may be different) plays for no reason other than \"it's a very famous catchy song.\" It got replaced with something called \"Harmony in Sport\" by Henri Seroka. I think it was composed for the 84 Olympics or something, I'm not sure.\n\nI feel like, S2 and 3 had songs that weren't massive hits in general that would cost a lot, so most may have stayed. But the few expensive songs got cropped out. 4-5-6 had many more hits. You can see all the originals in [this guide](http://retroweb.com/nexp/Northern_Exposure_Music_Guide.txt), but proper research needs to be done to determine which ones got replaced.\n\nOther than those, I think many viewers are frustrated about the change of final scene in 6.11, where \"Caminando Por La Calle\" by Gypsy Kings was replaced with a funky no-name song. The funkiness aside, I don't think the original adds any intrinsic value to the scene, it would go with any romantic moderate tempo track, but that replacement wasn't it. Same thing with \"The Fling\" soundtrack, \"A Whiter Shade of Pale\" doesn't have any intrinsic connection to the scene, just that it's nice to hear a worldwide hit. The replacement, \"Time Stood Still\" by Camaro Danny isn't *great* either, but barely a downgrade since the original doesn't really fit better. Emotional acoustic guitar with lyrics, totally fine with me.\n\nThe replacement track in 4.6 is pretty good, maybe the best among the replacements. But even then, the original it replaces can't possibly be beaten; \"La Passerella di Addio\" by Rota Nino is a classic and innately tied to Fellini's movies, so it's thematically compatible with the episode, although it must've cost a fortune. It was replaced with a track called [\"Venetian Boat Song\"](https://youtu.be/WQEgszVFZwQ) and I like this one a lot.\n\nIn 5.21, the episode of Ron and Eric's wedding, \"White Wedding\" by Billy Idol comes up randomly in a scene at The Brick around 8-9 mins, could easily be attributed to the jukebox playing. But they replaced that with a rock song with lyrics I can't find out what.", "created_utc": "1641571169.0", "edited": "1641572616.0", "id": "hrnf9hh", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_rxtb40", "parent_id": "t3_rxtb40", "score": "2", "subreddit": "northernexposure", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qrg7"}, {"author": "BahtiyarKopek", "body": "I don't think it's a white people thing, rather a small town thing.

She keeps pushing herself forward, trying to go against the image in her parents' mind *just* to prove to her parents that she can. It's like one of those cliche achievement stories where the person got bullied in high school, mean kids told them \"You can't become\" such and such. And the person worked all their lives just to prove them wrong. And when they do achieve it, they proudly share the story. *But this whole time* they obsessed over the abusive treatment they received in the past, lost sleep over it, dealt with the stress/hard work etc that comes with it and basically used poison as a fuel.

I mean, the conversation when he comes to tell her to come back is a pathetic demonstration. As Michelle says, they argue and then buy each other gifts, sweeping the reason under the rug, pretend it didn't happen and just move on. That's a really unhealthy relationship. The fact that he keeps missing the point when Michelle tries to explain it, drives her even more mad because Phil is beyond help. Compare that conversation with when he comes to tell her they *need to bowl for the team* even if they hate each other. That's the kind of behaviour any rational person would expect from a partner.\n\nIndividually I like each a lot, of course no replacement for Joel, but they add a different flavor.

From Maggie's first visit it's clear that the woman puts items that belong to the man on the shelf for sale, things she doesn't like, and they argue about it, again pretty standard. But Maggie just collects all these ambiguous details and writes a story, which Fleischman explains, would be nice if there were detective stories in life. It would be interesting and there would also be solutions to things. The fact that Maggie wants to buy \"a coyote-headed death god as a wedding gift,\" in Fleischman's words, \"he was probably trying to protect you from yourself.\" The gift itself is the representation of her anger towards her father for getting remarried and on top of that not inviting Maggie. Freudian theory is very prevalent in the episode. She admits this later in Fleischman's office, how she wanted to hit her father all week about the wedding.\n\nAbout the second part, yeah you're right, I never really thought about it that way.

It was for me too. At first watch I was 90% frustrated, but 10% confused. Now after so many rewatches when I look at it, it's a lot different than what I initially felt.\n\nFirst off, the state of Alaska isn't really breaking the contract. The stipulation for Joel to get his vacation is that a substitute physician must be willing to take his post during his abscence, which is perfectly logical, and this time nobody was found. Important to note that everyone in the town is privy to this information. Joel can't blame anyone for this. He's just being victimized by circumstances. There *is* no one to blame, there is nobody he can be mad at but circumstances. So he directs his rage towards Alaska and goes on a strike, which inevitably endangers his potential patients. He just puts himself in the wrong position when he was the victim. And of course, Joel's obsessive personality has everything to do with the way he flips out of control, makes him dig his heels even when he's got no chance to win. Even though it's against the contract to negotiate, Maurice and the Cicelians offer in good faith to compensate him with cash and services when it's absolute that the vacation is not possible, but he doesn't take it. The town's people sympathize with his situation, but he escalates it and this refusal is the act of war.\n\nAnother point is Joel's flawed moral development. When, say, Mike is hired to represent the state against him, he just takes it fully personally and goes off on him, \"After all I've done for you?\" and lists all the medical treatments he did for him. So this is what Kohlberg defines as \"Good Boy/Good Girl\" stage in moral development. Joel is listing all these to imply he *expected* Mike to do him favours in return, treat him nicely, take care of his interest at a time like this. The medical procedures, by the way, Joel is hired to perform, that are in his job description. And Mike is also just doing his job when Joel is violating a fine print article in his contract. Mike is obviously not suing Joel personally, he's representing the people against the fancy doctor from New York who threw a tantrum when the universe screwed him.\n\nJoel repeats similar lines to other characters, \"How could you do this to me, I set your broken bones, delivered your babies\" etc. Again these are his job's requirements and have nothing to do with him violating his contract. He could've been straight as an arrow, doesn't change that fact. What he says to Ruth-Anne is insane, \"Every single one of you stood before me naked, sick and needy, desperate for my help.\" So he not only thinks this is a quid-pro-quo deal, not only throws them in their faces, but on top of that he felt a sense of superiority for doing these, he's lording over the towners because he was performing, grudgingly and openly resentfully all the way through by the way, simply his job.\n\nOk, I'm losing track again, this is getting too long. But finally, what Shelly says is the moral of the episode. When Joel asks, \"How can you be a part of this lawsuit,\" she says \"Just being a teamplayer, all-for-one, one-for-all.\" So, that's the real contract Joel broke. He got screwed by the universe, or let's even say the state, but he still broke the social contract against his very small and intimate community.", "created_utc": "1639430201.0", "edited": "1639432419.0", "id": "hoffctp", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_rfnnnd", "parent_id": "t3_rfnnnd", "score": "3", "subreddit": "northernexposure", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qrg7"}, {"author": "BahtiyarKopek", "body": "[List of United States extradition treaties](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_extradition_treaties)", "created_utc": "1639223607.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ho40xb4", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_rdxx20", "parent_id": "t3_rdxx20", "score": "20", "subreddit": "GlobalTalk", "subreddit_id": "t5_mg3b6"}, {"author": "BahtiyarKopek", "body": "For being assaulted by a famous professional football player, whose job has nothing whatsoever to do with tackling/stopping fans, in front of thousands of audience and ~50 cameras while non-violently trespassing into the field.

Sibling rivalry is like the most universal thing in the world. Younger siblings get away with anything in their parents' eyes and this results in a lot of negative feelings in the elder(s), and if it continues to adulthood, which it does in BCS, it can create serious trauma. Jimmy is undisputedly the favourite kid, despite his faults. And with an ambitious and driven person like Chuck, this favouritism creates a poisonous wound that can never heal. The sibling rivalry due to favouritism is pretty much the root cause of all evil in BCS, including all the things you've listed.\n\nOn top of that, because their father passes away when Jimmy was very young and there's like 10+ year difference between them, Chuck is a father-figure for Jimmy and he constantly tries to get his attention, his approval, he wants Chuck to be proud of him. But because Chuck has a lot of negative feelings towards Jimmy, he can never get it. In fact the more he accomplishes the worse Chuck feels about him, so he tries more.

Each episode is kind of a stand-alone, especially \"Soapy Sanderson.\" But they also lay quite a strong foundation with Bernard's introduction, the nature of Holling-Shelly and Joel-Elaine relationships. That dream sequence in \"Russian Flu,\" where Joel dreams that Elaine is his sister almost foreshadows the break-up. S1 and 2 could've almost been a single season if not for the break-up in episode 2.1. It also starts the long tradition of absolutely bizarre dreams.\n\nI think it's a popular opinion that S3 is the best season, followed by 2 and 4, even though based on IMDb ratings 2 is the best (but according to those numbers, \"Jules et Joel\" and \"Dateline: Cicely\" both score 8.1, which is dreadfully low).\n\nJoel's departure was not cool, that's just a scientific fact. But it is also undeniable that \"Up River\" was absolutely wonderful. Even \"The Quest,\" where he leaves, considering the circumstances, was beautifully handled. I can't help but feel that ending up in the fishing village was always intended for Joel. If Cicely hadn't transformed him completely, the show would not have had a sense of closure, not unlike how Joel felt after getting dumped with a letter.\n\nOver this last rewatch I'm coming to the end of, my perspective of Chris-Maggie is slightly changing. I still feel that their getting together was awkward and didn't seem very well-written. BUT when you put some pieces together *cue The X-Files theme* it seems like it was a long time coming. In \"Slow Dance,\" the scene where Joel leads Maggie to the center of the bar and they embrace in this medium shot, Chris is right there with them, the only non-extra, with a yearning look on his face, both hands wrapped around a beer bottle. Maybe he interpreted the dance as Joel making his move and if he hadn't, he might have? Before that in the \"Big Kiss,\" the fact that Chris has to sleep with the most beautiful girl in town to get his voice back turns into an awkward rivalry with Joel. There probably are other things I'm missing but the biggest sign is *X-Files intensifies*, in \"The Letter,\" Maggie's younger self fawns over Chris, she can't contain herself. But Younger Maggie is literally Maggie, it's her subconscious, she's very attracted to Chris and for some reason this feeling is down in the basement of her mind. Maybe it's got something to do with Rick showing up in her dream and telling her (it's again Maggie telling herself) that every guy she's had a relationship with is \"gypsies, roamers\" and that she needs someone steady like Joel. She's been avoiding the inevitable Chris-ening since Rick's death, which fundamentally might just be evolutionary since we're all programmed to look for mates for the long haul. But the attraction is there, no doubt.\n\nI actually love Phil and Michelle, their relationship is genuinely so cute, they very obviously love each other dearly and up until the major falling out they were rock solid. Phil wasn't a cheap Joel at all, the Capras both wanted to come to Alaska. I don't think he was another disgruntled out-of-towner, he does flip out occasionally but that's because they're in a place like they've never been before. They handle Cicely seven folds better than Joel. One very small detail I noticed is that he finds the Founder's Day sock ornaments weird, but he still picks up one and wears it. Pre-transformation Joel would wanna have a grand total of \"nothing\" to do with that. His Italianness was a spice that branched out into interesting points but \"Little Italy\" was pretty weird. It's like they had two ideas, the little restaurant and the vendetta and decided to use both.\n\nAdam is a pure gem, one of the most creative and entertaining characters on TV by far. Eugene is cool but he barely gets any lines, there was potential but they didn't give much depth to his character. I love Leonard as well, he's awesome.

If the producers had had a little budgetary foresight and picked a similarly fitting but less expensive song in the original cut we wouldn't be here.\n\nOn the other hand, the Gipsy Kings song in that scene is a penultimate example of an expendable track that was picked purely because it was in a major album by a very popular band. There are trillions of moderate tempo songs about love in this universe and several billions of them are in Spanish. And I'm not exactly defending the replacement, it's not the best choice either, I don't even know what it's called or what it's about. But the alternatives that could be played in that scene to beautify it are endless. A Spanish song about walking down the street and falling in love (that's literally all of it) made by a French band isn't an inseperable part of NX. All of the complaint in this issue is directed at the obscurity of the replacement track, but fails to note the meaninglessness and out-of-placeness of the original.\n\nI've watched the entire show with and without original soundtracks several times over.

It's the age-old controversy around why Napoleon really lost the war, and it's a far-fetched but not unique theory that he personally wasn't there leading the war, which gives way to creative fictional scenarios. So supposedly, Pierre stays in Alaska afterwards while Napoleon goes back, and he settles down, starts a family, and then this family branches out from the main tribe, becomes a sub-tribe, the fictional Tellakutans. The claim of the Natives that come to pick him up is that Pierre is their ancestor. You may have noticed when they barged into the town meeting in the church, they're quite short (French stereotype) and speak some form of Native language (maybe Tlingit?) with the part \"for the corpse\" in French (pour le cadavre), implying Pierre influenced the language as well. Realistically a lot of research would need to be made to confirm it, but the Natives seem confident enough and they take him away. Ultimately I think the message is justified, it's their heritage and their ancestry, they should get to keep it. Maurice as always symbolizes the greedy imperial capitalist, trying to use the body for his capital gain. This is the definition of cultural appropriation by the way.\n\nThis part of Joel's change is pretty much universal, your whole life you are taught certain historical events/people and one day one of these facts is refuted, your whole life now feels like a lie. But as painful as the process may be, his rigid modern psyche becomes more flexible. He is now able to question what are regarded as absolute facts and he's not afraid to do so. It's like when humanity had to accept the Earth wasn't the center of the universe, or that humans weren't unique species, superior to all other animals. It's a huge blow to one's sense of self, it's disorienting.\n\nJoel also advocates for the revealing of this finding to the entire world, which I believe is justified. And after the Elijah dream he tells Maurice they should turn the body over to the Natives, which I also believe is justified. Culture belongs to the tribe, truth belongs to everyone.\n\nSide note; Chris arguing \"what would people feel like if we did reveal it\" was pretty un-Chris-like, but a Cicely resident intellectual had to counter-argue Joel's position. I guess the writers thought another Joel vs. Maggie would be boring and too much on the viewers.

But then he figures it out that he's out of his depth, that the ring demands him to sell his soul for great success in moviemaking. When the guy says \"Now you've done it,\" his answer \"Wha-What did I do?\" is so childlike innocent.

Yeah Joel leaving was a real bummer but overall I'm not too disappointed how it turned out. Episodes are generally full and well written. After several watches I really like the Capras and wouldn't do anything different about them. Their stories are really interesting and deep, especially Dr. Capra's. They both come to Cicely enthusiastically, in complete contrast to Joel, but their feelings change afterwards, Dr. Capra even yells out \"I hate this place!\" at some point. I wouldn't mind if they continued with Capras' transformation. Although the Little Italy episode was kinda dumb to be honest.\n\nMy dislike for Shelly's personality is amplified by several times when she fights Joel for his tapes. Why did they have to write it like that? I think they were desperately trying to create a scenario where Joel gives up on a worldly possession of his that he valued greatly. It's a big achievement for his spiritual transformation. But did Shelly have to be such a giant bitch? This happens on the funky water episode and she's not actually herself, and Joel probably wouldn't have let go if she wasn't that savage, but I just feel bad for Joel. Is that like a Jesus level transformation? Like not only giving up on worldly possessions but also turning the other cheek?\n\nUnder the circumstances, I like the episode where Joel leaves for its epic quest style. It's all about literary references with NX so that was fine. And he spends his last few days in Alaska with Maggie, travelling, talking, getting over obstacles together, which is very wholesome. They're more in sync in this episode than they are through the entire series. The way Joel teleports to NY is kinda weird but what can you do. Disregarding the behind-the-scene struggles, the whole thing connects together decently. The one and only purpose of Joel's coming to Alaska was him going through a spiritual and mental transformation and he achieves it, he's a new man, and he goes back when he's done.\n\nThe only thing I would've done different is Chris and Maggie. That's by far the worst decision they've ever made. Everything else is either on the same level of NX greatness or at the very least bearable (Little Italy, funky water, Chris being mean to Phil etc). But this is just not right. There was absolutely no need for that. Chris and Maggie separately were the strongest characters in the show, they could've ended it like that and it would be perfect. Chris doesn't have to have a relationship, just let him be his independent, wild, preacher/radio dj. Not just with Magggie, the whole part about him wanting to settle down is just a major disappointment. Maggie especially doesn't have to have a relationship after Joel, the only boyfriend she's had that doesn't end up dead. She can just spend the rest of the show single and independent.

I think fictionally Phil's character is well developed and has decent depth. The distinction has to be made between \"annoying because it's not a well developed character\" and \"annoying because of his personality\" because if it's the latter than that's probably what the writers meant to achieve with it. Yes, it's strange after 5 and a half seasons with the main character, but I found that this feeling goes away in 2nd and 3rd watching and you come to liking them. (I've watched the series more times than that.)\n\n>Maggie and Chris have absolutely zero chemistry\n\nI don't think there is a any other opinion on this issue, it's a very lousy attempt to salvage Maggie's lacking relationship theme. She acts like she's an independent woman who doesn't need a man, but actually she desperately needs one because her self-worth depends on it. This ruins Chris's character because he is the modern Jesus figure of the town, preaches day and night, he's a man of religion, everybody loves him, his name is \"Chris\" etc. There is no way this was the original path for Chris.\n\nI agree that the final season was an unfortunate disappointment but I don't blame Rob Morrow for it. After watching it so many times, the series is for me what the Bible is for Robinson Crusoe. From time to time I open up a random episode or binge on a particular season.

Some may take longer to learn and utilize than others, that's all.\n\nShe's definitely viable. She's never really been not viable. She's mostly been viable even for competitive. Don't know what your rank is but I'm gonna assume it's not very high, no offence. In your Elo, you can make anything work, 90% of all players are shit anyways. She's a pretty safe pick due to her hypercarry potential. If you or your team don't feed your asses off, you should be able to carry late game.\n\nShe's not the easiest ADC. Even after her update she's still in a position where she can be easily abused, pretty much one-dimentional gameplay, and most match-ups are struggle. But speaking from the perspective of someone with 55-60% winrate with Ashe over thousands of games, I can say that she can get over the worst looking matchups or come back from and carry pretty hopeless games.\n\nStarting up, you're gonna wanna focus on farming. If you're not duo-queue'ing, stay safe and try to get all the cs, buy a pink ward everytime you have gold and inventory space (and remember to place them), try to break even in the laning phase. With a confident support you can play aggressive and get ahead in lane, but you gotta know everything about the match-up and practice a lot first.\n\nUse your E to get vision of enemy jungle when you have 2 stacks on it. In laning phase, be careful with your mana, you're really dependent on your W and Q. In late game, you can shoot your ult from a distance and catch people very easily. Say everyone's mid, and you have vision on an enemy champion. Shoot your arrow, most often it doesn't matter who it is, cuz your team will kill them before the stun is over. And bam, that's an objective, like a turret or dragon/baron.\n\nIn teamfights you need to stay back and shoot whatever you can shoot, mostly it's the tank in the front line, focus them then you can move on. If you have opportunity to ult their ADC or mid that's good, but if the enemy initiates you need to hold on to it so you can save yourself. I'm gonna assume you know about orb-walking or attack-move and shit. With Ashe, this mechanic becomes *way more important* than other ADCs.

Humanist movement replaced God and put the humanbeing on the focus and the humanistic values. But on the other hand humanism's spread through Europe coincides with the European colonialism, the slave trades, exploitation of the East and the Americas and so on. So when you say humanism, and elevation of The Human, you're not including *all* humans. Blacks don't count, Asians don't count, Indigenous Americans don't count etc. Deconstructionist works of people like Derrida and Edward Said punched holes in this philosophy that covered over most of Enlightenment. Also when a period of arts and literature ends and you look back and ask \"Why?\" as in post-modernism looked at modernism, post-humanism now looks at all over Enlightenment questions past values, eliminate the ones that don't fit, change into something new. We hadn't quite gotten over our racist, ethnic, sexual, cultural prejudices in post-modernism. I think the 21st century's bar-none egalitarianism will determine the next movement.\n\nSo about the example:\n\n>The modern narrative of the United States is that native americans were savages, illiterate, completely devoid of any culture whatsoever, literally subhuman. Anythign that grants them any human characteristics whatsoever is challenging the meta-narrative of contemporary US nationalism.\n\n>The post-modern narrative of the US is: \"Maybe, sometimes, the US politicians didn't make the right choices 100% of the time, sometimes\".

Now, in relation with above, and Cyril rejecting male gender roles; \"manly appetite\" is alluded to twice during Cyril's visit, once directly by Josephine, *\"We know what a man\u2019s appetite is,\"* and then by the narrator, *\"But Cyril was most unmanlike in appetite.\"* The story being a modernist text, change from the old to new through rejection or inevitable means is always a major theme. The youngest member of the family is drifting away from the male gender characteristics with his appetite. Appetite in general is associated with greed, desire to devour, consume, thus again colonialism/imperialism. *But* instead, Nurse Andrews has the manly appetite. The sisters are annoyed by her eating and asking for more and more, and because of her manly appetite she's associated with the patriarchy. If it wasn't for her the sisters would be lot more at freedom to eat whenever/wherever they wanted to.\n\nAnd another thing is the chocolate cake, which is also made with sugar. But the way the sisters are agressively cutting at the cake, posing over it with the knife, on top of which Josephine's remark *\"Now, Cyril, you mustn\u2019t be frightened of our cakes,\"* means this cake is more than that. \"The rich, dark colour\" of the cake is emphasized (compared to Josephine's winter gloves and Constantia's shoe soles, I don't know what this means). At the deathbed of their father, he is described \"purple, a dark, angry purple in the face\" and during Cyril's visit \"curving his hand like a purple meringue-shell over one ear.\" When it comes to skin colours, purple is more like tanned and sort of flushed. The chocolate cake, on top of being sweet and dark coloured, was more than likely bought by Mr. Pinner's money. They're in a way taking their frustration out in an unconscious protesting manner on the cake, which symbolizes their father. This frustration manifests again towards the end in Constantia's stream of consciousness paragraph, *\"It was only when she came out of the tunnel into the moonlight or by the sea or into a thunderstorm that she really felt herself.\"*\n\nCyril's visits being a rare treat seems very much like another piece in this particular puzzle, but I don't know where to fit it.
