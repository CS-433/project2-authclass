I keep my acceleration gentle, shift at low RPMs, and engine brake as often as I can, as well as leaving the windows down vs using the AC as much as possible. If you're in an automatic, you just have to be more gentle with both the gas and the brake. If a light a couple hundred yards from you is turning red, don't stay on the throttle. There's no prize for being first to the red light. If you know how to shift in manual mode, this will also help tremendously, as you can control your shift points and engine brake. I personally recommend upshifting just over 2k rpm, and downshifting at roughly the same engine speeds. You don't want to be over revving it, because that just uses more gas. If you DO drive manual, don't be going 3-4-5-4-5-4-3-4-5 on a simple road just because it has a few twists. Usually 4th will be just fine for both engine braking and acceleration.

In English, cold is something you are, but in French, it's something to have. Therefore instead of \"\u00eatre\", you'd use \"avoir\", conjugated for third person singular, \"a\".
