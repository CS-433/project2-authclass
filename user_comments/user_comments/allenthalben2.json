Bristol uni has had, to say the least, an unusual number of suicide cases over the past few years and it's not hard to see why.\n\nIt might help you to actually read why the Judge rejected the university's argument:\n\n> This defence was rejected by Judge Ralton, who found: \u201cIt is obvious to me that the fundamental purpose of the assessments was to elicit from Natasha answers to questions put to her following the experiments and it is a statement of the obvious that **such a process does not automatically require face to face oral interaction and there are other ways of achieving the same.\u201d**\n\n> The Judge found that adjustments, such as removing the need for oral assessments altogether or, in relation to the conference on 30 April, 2018, assessing Natasha in the absence of her peers or using a smaller venue, were reasonable and should have been put in place.  \n\n> He observed that \u201cwhilst a few ideas\u201d regarding possible adjustments were \u201cfloated\u201d by the university \u201cnone were implemented\u201d. \n\nBut better off, why not try reading the [46 page judgement](https://www.judiciary.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Abrahart-v-Uni-Bristol-judgment-200522.pdf) and seeing that the judge arrived at their decision on pretty solid grounds.\n\nSome important quotes, amongst others:\n\n> I have not found anything within the course literature to say that the interviews and or the presentation can only be carried out orally.

There is no evidence that Natasha refused to engage with any reasonable adjustments because whilst a few ideas were floated none were implemented. The greatest criticism that could be made of Natasha is that she did not engage with Disability Services but that non-engagement resulted from the disability. **Unfortunately in the absence of a Disability Support Summary the University seemed to simply stall in its consideration of reasonable adjustments.** In those circumstances it cannot rely on lack of knowledge on its part to make reasonable adjustments (applying Tarbuck v Sainsbury\u2019s Supermarkets Ltd [2006] IRLR 664).\n\nPage 35 points out why the defence of 'what applies for one student must apply for all' is poor.\n\n> There can be no doubt that the University would have been in breach; the main breach would be continuing to require Natasha to give interviews and attend the conference and marking her down if she did not participate when it knew that Natasha was unable to participate for mental health reasons beyond her control.\n\n---\n\nIt's ridiculous we still have such ignorant comments like yours from people who fail to realise that a social anxiety disability is not \"oh I'm a bit shy!\" and that preventing someone from doing well in a course due to this is outright discrimination.", "created_utc": "1656206013.0", "edited": "False", "id": "idr5mad", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_vkpgm9", "parent_id": "t1_idqq9ak", "score": "11", "subreddit": "unitedkingdom", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhqb"}, {"author": "allenthalben2", "body": "America would be barren if all those without the financial and legal capacity to leave were actually able to leave.", "created_utc": "1656081734.0", "edited": "1656081932.0", "id": "idkavbp", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_vjpnei", "parent_id": "t1_idk9818", "score": "2", "subreddit": "worldnews", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13"}, {"author": "allenthalben2", "body": "*When Fascism comes to America, it will be wrapped in the flag and carrying a cross.*", "created_utc": "1656080801.0", "edited": "False", "id": "idk8kbv", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_vjpnei", "parent_id": "t3_vjpnei", "score": "29", "subreddit": "worldnews", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13"}, {"author": "allenthalben2", "body": "*When Fascism comes to America, it will be wrapped in the flag and carrying a cross.*", "created_utc": "1656080446.0", "edited": "False", "id": "idk7qh2", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_vjpfbh", "parent_id": "t3_vjpfbh", "score": "1", "subreddit": "news", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3l"}, {"author": "allenthalben2", "body": "Saw some in the Don at Kelham maybe a month ago, but only once or twice.", "created_utc": "1656077258.0", "edited": "False", "id": "idk0tx4", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_vjhgjg", "parent_id": "t3_vjhgjg", "score": "2", "subreddit": "sheffield", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rab3"}, {"author": "allenthalben2", "body": "If you think 'bothering to vote' qualifies you as someone who understands politics and 'the last labour government', then that's *cute* at best.\n\nIf you think the Conservatives have 'fixed' the country then I can only assume you are extremely wealthy and egotistical with no concern for anyone earning under 50k a year.\n\nIt doesn't take a genius to glance at Britain and conclude it's an absolute shithole compared to before.

The amount of books in Luxembourgish has been growing for years, and more Luxembourgish books make an appearance at the literary festivals. There are, again, plenty of songs in Luxembourgish if you spend more than one minute looking instead of jumping to judgemental decisions. They have their own festivals and cultural events, cuisine, idiosyncrasies in language, mythological and authentic history etc. etc.\n\nAs to 'natives struggling to write it'. Sorry, but this affects numerous languages. Multiple English speakers have problems writing homophones, but that doesn't mean one shouldn't learn English. Luxembourgish has had a repressed history in the country through the domination of the French (and for a period German) language, and creating a standard orthography has not been high up on the system. It also doesn't mean they struggle with their language, just with a codified writing system for it. For thousands of years there was no standard to writing many European languages, it does mean that people did not speak the language? How dense can you be.\n\nAs a person has already remarked in this thread, why come here just to whine you don't want to learn Luxembourgish?\n\nAs a small suggestion, based on history which doesn't need to be explained to you hopefully, it *doesn't look great* when a German of all people starts denigrating other languages and claiming that they have no culture.

If you have two infinitives and then you, in addition, have an auxiliary verb (inc. *werden*), they often take priority with some exceptions.\n\nCanoo.net used to have perfect explanations for this, which have now all been integrated into dict.leo.org. [This](https://dict.leo.org/grammatik/deutsch/Satz/Wortstellung/Praedikat.xml?lang=de#id=3.5.2.d) is the relevant page, scroll down to 3.5.2.d. As you can tell the rules are extensive, but it *mostly* boils down to the rule I mentioned above.\n\nFor your specific case with werden, you can do it with or without:\n\n> Wenn eine Verbgruppe zwei (oder mehr) Infinitive enth\u00e4lt, die vom Hilfsverb *werden* abh\u00e4ngig sind, kann das finite Hilfsverb im Nebensatz vor die Infinitive treten oder gem\u00e4\u00df der allgemeinen Regel ganz am Schluss stehen:\n\n> Beispiel: weil ich euch werde kommen h\u00f6ren /// auch: weil ich euch kommen h\u00f6ren werde\n\nSo your example sentence could also be \"dass Johnson sich daraus nicht mehr freischwimmen k\u00f6nnen wird\". Both are accepted.\n\n---\n\nAs to your question in the comments about \"Ich wei\u00df, dass du mich hast kommen sehen\", the answer is yet again :-) both are fine. The page linked above explains this to. When using haben + *hei\u00dfen* or *helfen* as Ersatzinfinitiv, you **must** put conjugated haben before all other verbs; however, for an Ersatzinfinitiv using the verbs of perception (*sehen, f\u00fchlen, h\u00f6ren*) or *lassen* you **can** put it in front, but you don't need to.\n\n> Wenn eine Verbgruppe einen Ersatzinfinitiv von hei\u00dfen, lassen, helfen, sehen, f\u00fchlen, h\u00f6ren enth\u00e4lt und dieser Ersatzinfinitiv vom Hilfsverb haben abh\u00e4ngig ist, wird das finite Hilfsverb im Nebensatz in der Regel vor die Verbgruppe gestellt. Zumindest bei lassen, sehen, f\u00fchlen, h\u00f6ren gilt aber die Endstellung des finiten Hilfsverbs auch als korrekt:\n\n> weil man euch hat kommen hei\u00dfen //// *nicht* weil man euch kommen hei\u00dfen hat\n\n> Beispiel: weil sie euch haben ankommen sehen\t//// auch: weil sie euch ankommen sehen haben\n\nIf you wanted to make it easy for yourself, if you always put the conjugated auxiliary first in a Nebensatz with two infinitives then you can scarcely go wrong.

It's worked in numerous countries \u2014 New Zealand is requiring 90% vaccinated in different regions; France required vaccination for the healthcare industry which shot up rates; vaccination rates in Austria are climbing after being stagnant for months; vaccination rates in Wales and Scotland, albeit low, still increased with a vaccine passport. You can argue as much as you want, but you cannot deny the raw numbers.\n\n2. If an individual has come this far along without having been vaccinated, the likelihood of them getting vaccinated is at this point, on the floor. I don't like this twisted narrative certain sceptics have when they say \"oh I was going to get vaccinated, I swear, and then the government said I should so now I won't! TAKE THAT!\".\n\n3. The situation with a vaccine passport only leads to an increase in vaccination rates. Doing what we're currently doing isn't leading to increases. So the choice is either i. where we currently are and not much further, or ii. moving along even if only slightly.\n\nRight now I do not see a need for there to be a vaccine passport, and I think the vaccination rates are high enough for us to withstand the winter without one. If it got to the point when the healthcare system is (somehow) even more overwhelmed than right now, then it's going to have to be considered because the only alternatives would be i. restrictions which everyone would rightfully lose their minds over, or, ii. a lockdown for the unvaccinated which would be almost impossible to police.\n\nWhat I think the most embarrassing thing about all of this is, is that *if we'd had a government properly funding the healthcare system for the last 11 years* we wouldn't even be having these fucking concerns.

But, more concrete criticism:\n\n> Lorna Slater, the Scottish Green minister in charge of delivering the scheme, confirmed on Wednesday the government was now unsure when it would start and was urgently negotiating with retailers and producers.\n\nSo they're delaying and talking to retailers about how to introduce it, how 'shambolic'.\n\n> Now Scotland looks like an object lesson in how not to deliver one of the world\u2019s most basic and widely deployed environmental measures. \n\nIn what world is this a 'basic' and 'widely deployed' measure? Sorry, but a small proportion of the world do this \u2014 in Europe it's only about [ten countries](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c2/Container-deposit_legislation_in_Europe_SVG_map.svg/1024px-Container-deposit_legislation_in_Europe_SVG_map.svg.png) for example\n\nAnd as for 'basic' **abso-fucking-lutely not**. Based on the German system which I have enough knowledge about: you have to decide what drinks are going to have the surcharge (fruit juice, smoothies, yoghurt-based drinks, glass milk bottles, alcohol?), determine if the surcharge will vary depending on material, determine which shops are required to have return schemes, determine whether shops should be required to accept all returned drink containers or only those of brands they sell, determine whether this will apply to international drink products, determine how they are to get the money back ('shopping voucher', cash, or both), [if a voucher] how long this can be valid for, manufacturing and installing machines somewhere for this purpose, tax implications etc.\n\nIt's absolutely not 'basic' on any level and, what a surprise, that quote has come from Greenpeace. The leaders in reactionary comments without actually considering the logistics of the affair.\n\n> is embarrassing for a government which loves to shout about its green credentials.\n\nNot doing this doesn't mean their green credentials are in tatters, but I do agree that Nicola tries to paint Scotland as being more green than it is.\n\n> Every year of delay means millions more bottles being dumped or burned.\n\nA huge amount of plastic bottles have now been made more easily recyclable by waste facilities. There are far more significant environmental problems than bottles of cans, it's really quite the wrong focus.\n\n> Slater said the chaos of Brexit, the problems faced by retailers during the Covid crisis and uncertainties about VAT charges on deposits had been obstacles to the scheme\u2019s introduction.\n\nYou mean a global pandemic would have impacted the timeline for this? I'm absolutely astonished. How do Greenpeace and co. not realise this, genuinely? There have been much graver concerns since the end of 2019 and now than a return bottle scheme.\n\n> Slater said she was negotiating with retailers and producers \u201cto figure out what the shortest practical time is possible to implement this scheme given the challenges around Brexit and around the pandemic. This is constant industry engagement.\u201d\n\nSo there's an actual reason for the delay, again. It's an utter non-story.\n\n----\n\nI agree that this system hasn't been managed perfectly but, 1. we just had a global pandemic with greater concerns, 2. it's absolutely not as easy to implement something as implied, 3.

France is heavily renowned for its lingusitic purism supported by the Academie Fran\u00e7aise, the Czech language revival consisted of trying to bring back words to compete with and replace German, Icelandic is still heavily conservative in borrowing words, Korean (particularly of the North) naturally remains resistant to loanwords, German has gone through these same periods as well, and the list just carries on.\n\nEnglish certainly has had it's share of linguistic purism movements, but they never really grew beyond the works of a handful of writers and only certain words were affected. With the absence of any major public institution pushing for the replacement of words of foreign origin with coined anglo-saxon terms, purism was even less likely.
