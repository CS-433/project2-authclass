Being in-person should also help.\n\nAbout learning good conversational spanish, you may need to practice outside of class. There are dedicated sections of the course for practicing and they help to hold conversations but each individual does not speak that much. Although, if you enroll in second year classes and up, I'm sure you will be fine. If found learning past tense forms (pr\u00e9terito) of verbs was very helpful for conversations (as well as knowing french lol).\n\nI joined a Discord server for spanish/english learners, where there are plenty of people from around the world willing to converse, which might be an option to broaden your vocabulary if there are no other students up for it.\n\nMichela Gentile was my prof for ESP1992 and she was great! Really beloved by other students as well.
