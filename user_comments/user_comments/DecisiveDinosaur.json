Sure in NA t2 is not that popular because it's just the franchise teams' academy teams, the teams don't really have any identity besides that. \n\nBut in EU, the t2 scene is thriving, especially because of EU Masters, where you can root for your region's teams against the other regions. Some of the teams are even more popular than the franchised teams (which is ofc a downside of franchising, imagine if KCorp was in LEC instead of Astralis, but that's the opposite of saying that t2 is dead).\n\nI imagine the VRLs is Riot's attempt to replicate that for Valorant.", "created_utc": "1654408025.0", "edited": "1654436454.0", "id": "ib83dn6", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_v55f0d", "parent_id": "t1_ib81b3x", "score": "24", "subreddit": "ValorantCompetitive", "subreddit_id": "t5_2g5ach"}, {"author": "DecisiveDinosaur", "body": "yeah, Wikipedia is one of the two resources I use to learn grammar. just 3-5 minutes a day reading the wiki page for Swedish Grammar has done so much for me.

Let me elaborate: (long post warning)\n\nMy parents started talking to me using English around the time I was 8-9. I never responded in English though because it just felt weird. Ever since then, they basically got me to input English stuff only, so I stopped reading/watching things in my native language (Indonesian), and I got like 75% of my input in English. As for the output, it was still mostly Indonesian, but I was a quiet kid so I didn't really do much output either way.\n\nThings stayed the same until high school. At this point, I was probably around B1, and I'd done very little output. I didn't like English classes but I got so much input that most things became second nature. I couldn't explain how the majority of grammar works except for the fact that \"it sounds right\". I didn't do too well in English speaking assignments still. So many hesitations and instances of me just forgetting words. Keep in mind that I never did any deliberate output practice like shadowing. \n\nFor high school I went to a semi-international school, which means I had to output English in like 50% of my class time. I was still pretty bad then, really thick accent and my speaking was a lot worse than my writing, because I had no time to think. But it gradually got better. And at this point, I understood most of the input I got, except for maybe a word or two once in a while. \n\nFor college, I chose to be an English major, which meant I had to do English input and output for hours everyday. Even when I spoke to my classmates, I mostly used English. I still wasn't great when it comes to public speaking but that's because of my anxiety more than anything else. I found that in a private setting, I can speak using English just fine, even if the accent was still there. I believe this was when I reached C2, because I had to read academic papers every single day, write about them, and even write some myself. At this point, I can watch/listen to anything in English at 2x speed while understanding every single word. By the end of college, after my thesis defense, the professor said I sounded almost like an American, which is probably an exaggeration but it showed that I'd improved in terms of my accent.\n\nRight now, my grammar is still not perfect and I can't explain how they work, because I never actually \"learned\" grammar (never paid attention in class) and I'm relying only on the \"feeling\" I got from input. But at least I'm good enough that I can basically do almost anything with the language better than I can using my actual native language lol.", "created_utc": "1650099570.0", "edited": "1650100393.0", "id": "i4xruhj", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_u4rwua", "parent_id": "t3_u4rwua", "score": "8", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "DecisiveDinosaur", "body": "how did he make reyna look like a decent agent lmao", "created_utc": "1650046634.0", "edited": "False", "id": "i4v0ty1", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_u4b90r", "parent_id": "t3_u4b90r", "score": "8", "subreddit": "ValorantCompetitive", "subreddit_id": "t5_2g5ach"}, {"author": "DecisiveDinosaur", "body": "really excited about this one. hope f0rsaken brings out the Yoru if Bind gets picked", "created_utc": "1650030994.0", "edited": "False", "id": "i4tyx54", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_u47r9w", "parent_id": "t3_u47r9w", "score": "17", "subreddit": "ValorantCompetitive", "subreddit_id": "t5_2g5ach"}, {"author": "DecisiveDinosaur", "body": ">I may understand those sentences but I probably wouldn\u2019t able to produce them that easily like that.\n\nI think the idea is that you should ideally hear/read the sentence structure often enough in your input that you end up being able to produce them naturally without thinking about the grammar/structure for too long.

And I watch youtube videos in swedish as much as I can as a bonus. Oh and there's a Swedish news website that uses simpler Swedish, I read news from there if I have the time. \n\n\nfor grammar, I read the Wikipedia article on Swedish grammar, and also some textbooks, but I don't do these things THAT much, because I prefer understanding grammar from my immersion. Another thing I do is watching videos of Swedish language teachers teaching Swedish grammar in Swedish, not English, so it kinda doubles as immersion too. \n\n\nFor vocab i use Clozemaster mainly (15-30 mins a day). And when I encounter words/phrases I don't see in Clozemaster, I put them on Anki, which I only use for that, I don't use any premade decks, so only for about 5-10 mins a day.\n\nSpeaking and writing are by far the weakest aspects of my Swedish. At the end of my days, i usually just try to write or talk about my day, and if I talk about it, sometimes I record it just to see how I sound like. Sometimes I also practice conversing in Swedish (in text and voice) with my Swedish best friend, which means that I don't really have to look for tutors (at least for now).\n\nI feel like everyone's
