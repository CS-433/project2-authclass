I'm not a native Danish speaker and don't know much (200 hundred words at best), but there are definitely similarities there. I've also studied German in the past and am fluent in English, so a lot of the time I see a word in Dutch and my brain goes \"oh, Germanic languages strike again\" because it sounds so similar in Danish for example.\n\nthe pronunciation in Danish might seem scary at first, it just doesn't follow the same rules. For me, understanding Swedish or Norwegian is pretty impossible I find. they sound incredibly weird and I now find illogical things about them, like I did with Danish at first lol\n\nbut if you haven't dipped your toes in dansk at all, I bet that svensk and norsk will be a lot more familiar to a native English speaker", "created_utc": "1655270802.0", "edited": "False", "id": "icf7dnt", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_vc1c4z", "parent_id": "t1_iccxch9", "score": "1", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "Benka7", "body": "hello traveler, what brings you to my inn?", "created_utc": "1655269788.0", "edited": "False", "id": "icf5wzn", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_vcdki7", "parent_id": "t3_vcdki7", "score": "3", "subreddit": "irishwolfhound", "subreddit_id": "t5_2xnsg"}, {"author": "Benka7", "body": "u/repostsleuthbot", "created_utc": "1655269407.0", "edited": "False", "id": "icf5c9u", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_vcj418", "parent_id": "t3_vcj418", "score": "2", "subreddit": "interestingasfuck", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhsa"}, {"author": "Benka7", "body": "people over 18 scare me too. that's why I can't look into the mirror", "created_utc": "1654941227.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ibyikcl", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_v9izld", "parent_id": "t1_ibyg5hv", "score": "26", "subreddit": "photoshopbattles", "subreddit_id": "t5_2tecy"}, {"author": "Benka7", "body": "both good boys? :))", "created_utc": "1654847895.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ibtya9x", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_v8ofbw", "parent_id": "t1_ibrq70j", "score": "3", "subreddit": "irishwolfhound", "subreddit_id": "t5_2xnsg"}, {"author": "Benka7", "body": "cutieeee! the photobomb from the dog and kid in the background though\ud83d\ude06", "created_utc": "1654803656.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ibrpc6l", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_v8ofbw", "parent_id": "t3_v8ofbw", "score": "5", "subreddit": "irishwolfhound", "subreddit_id": "t5_2xnsg"}, {"author": "Benka7", "body": "And that's rare, knowing the shit we see in this Subreddit lol", "created_utc": "1654768424.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ibpqata", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_v7mlz3", "parent_id": "t1_ibppoj4", "score": "3", "subreddit": "AreTheStraightsOK", "subreddit_id": "t5_26qkg5"}, {"author": "Benka7", "body": "he didn't realize that he was the kindergarten teacher and she was leaving it under his supervision", "created_utc": "1654753645.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ibp9l7b", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_v7zkdz", "parent_id": "t1_ibod2nf", "score": "11", "subreddit": "pics", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh0u"}, {"author": "Benka7", "body": "and when I do it I'm told to go home because I'm too drunk smh...", "created_utc": "1654753513.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ibp9ewp", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_v7zkdz", "parent_id": "t1_ibotid4", "score": "27", "subreddit": "pics", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh0u"}, {"author": "Benka7", "body": "hihi, the fact it cracked someone up is better than any Reddit award!

If we wouldn't have had the writers and enlighteners we would definitely not exist as a nation today.\n\nToday we think that we were a big part of the Union, but the constitution that said that we were equals was only released before the unions demise.\n\nThen after WW2 we sort of wanted our capital Vilnius, because goddamn, that's where the grand duke Gediminas dreamt of a big iron wolf! How could we not have that as our capital?? Funnily enough, Lithuanians were but a minority there. So the Poles wanted to take it for themselves and turn it into Wi\u0142no. And they did just that.\nSome people say that the Poles wanted another Union, while we thought of ourselves as separate from the Polish and wanted our own country...\nLet's also skip the whole part how we took shot a couple French soldiers and took the Memel area (today's Klaip\u0117da)\nThen the Soviets came around, said to our government *in a Russian accent* \"Listen, we give Vilnius to you, but you must let our forces be in your country, understand?\"\nAnd so we did just that, which ultimately led to them occupying us.\nAfter we got our independence back we were friends with the Poles again and they helped us get into the EU and NATO.\n\nI'm obviously skipping out on a bunch of history here (independence battles, Soviet times, the Tsardom, other stuff), but the main takeaway is that we don't view the Union as the lowest point of our country, but we also understand that it would've made us lose our identity and that the Polish were the ones actually in control, not the Lithuanian farmers.", "created_utc": "1587228724.0", "edited": "False", "id": "fnstxbg", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_g36x8q", "parent_id": "t1_fnsr10k", "score": "1", "subreddit": "europe", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh4j"}, {"author": "Benka7", "body": "I hope you take snus and don't actually eat the whole thing.
