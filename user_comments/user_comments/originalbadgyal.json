Some of these studies are behind a paywall, but I can send the PDFs if you want.\n\nIt's not totally clear cut, but:\n\n[This](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/316203933_Effect_of_stroke-order_learning_and_handwriting_exercises_on_recognizing_and_writing_Chinese_characters_by_Chinese_as_a_foreign_language_learners) study into Chinese learning found that writing (in itself) \"helped students to memorize the orthography and output of Chinese characters... and also helped improve memorization of the meaning of Chinese characters\".\n\n[This](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24760141/) study into typed vs handwritten note taking found that although the subjects typically typed more, it was at a shallower level, and they performed worse on concept checking questions (asked sometime later) than those who hand wrote their notes. [This](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/17586801.2018.1536015) study, focussing on native Finns, produced similar results.\n\nHaving said all that, two things stand out from what I've read. First, it all depends on *how* tech is used, rather than tech just not being a good option. It may be that we just need to get more used to it as a language learning tool in its own right, introduce it at the appropriate stage of learning, and in doing so, deploy it mor effectively.\n\nSecond, the *differences* between the two modes seems to vary with the language in question. Interestingly, a study from [Sweden](https://www.idunn.no/doi/full/10.18261/issn.1891-943x-2017-04-04) found that particularly for kids with Swedish as a second language, typing produced more action verbs, while handwriting produced more descriptive language.\n\nPersonally, there's something about the physicality of writing that helps words stick. I think it just adds an extra dimension to my understanding of a word (I tend to say *and* write new vocab as I practice it). Also, my TL (Korean) is pretty geometric, and I enjoy working with my hands, so maybe the sense of \"drawing\" the word helps with securing meaning?

I'd say routinely changing the way I use a resource has massively helped. As an example, watching a short YT video without subs for listening comprehension is one thing, but I can also improve my language skills by:\n\n- shadowing the voices  \n- turning off subs/audio and verbally describing what you think is happening (record it and get it checked)  \n- transcription  \n- watch with L2 subs to improve reading speed, or observe sound vs spelling issues  \n- reading the transcript while watching to improve reading speed, or mark for cadence/stress\n\nThese are things I wouldn't have attempted before reaching a plateau.\n\nLikewise, I am more disciplined with how I spend my study time - things like pomodoro and Focusmate have been instrumental in showing me what I *really* do with my time vs what I think I'm doing.\n\nFor me, the biggest thing in overcoming the plateau is knowing what it will look like when you reach the top of the mountain. At the lower levels, much of what we \"choose\" to learn is prescribed by the tools we use (books, apps, teachers). If, when you reach the plateau, you think about your motivations more deeply and find a meaningful WHY - as in:\n\nwhat is your goal? > (for that answer): Why? > (for *that* answer): Why?\n\n...then it will become much clearer what you need to do (or, indeed, avoid) to get there.

I can't say I'm surprised that there's not a lot of literature out there on this subject. I'm also a linguist, so I would love to read the paper when you're done.\n\nTo answer your questions: My wife of 3 years has a particular scent around her torso a few days before it starts, so I sometimes know first. I'll just say \"your period is coming\", or \"you're on a woman ting\", but also it's kind of arousing so she'll know because I'm all over her. Her personal signs are that she's super huggy before, and when the period actually comes she'll just say \"I'm on my period\".\n\nPIV is pretty much out (her choice due to churning stomach), but we don't really see menstruation as an obstacle to fingering or oral. We actually own a period blanket... which doubles as a sex blanket during her period.\n\nOverall I'd say it's a positive experience for me. She's raw, a little vulnerable and very sexy at this time. I'm probably more enthusiastic than my wife :)", "created_utc": "1552329431.0", "edited": "1552330775.0", "id": "eialw17", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_ay1m5e", "parent_id": "t1_eiaad5m", "score": "1", "subreddit": "sex", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3p"}, {"author": "originalbadgyal", "body": "I have visions of Ripley in Aliens just looking at the lair and then torching the whole thing.", "created_utc": "1552316022.0", "edited": "False", "id": "eia2hl9", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_azu0ml", "parent_id": "t1_eia06g2", "score": "1", "subreddit": "AskMen", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s30g"}, {"author": "originalbadgyal", "body": "Cool!

And we went from friends to dating for 4 months and then engaged and married a year after that. That's A LOT of clunky rookieness in a short time. \n\nAll of my wife's girlfriends got married at 23 so at 27 (and me a few years older) she'd taken subliminal notes from them, some of which weren't very helpful. For instance it was assumed that I would want to spend our social time with other couples exclusively because her married friends always coupled up. (I didn't want to). At times I felt like I was being compared to X's man, which caused some tension. \n\nI'd been raised in an egalitarian all female family where everyone did every chore on rotation, whereas my wife had been given a couple of light chores since forever. I was quite inflexible and not great at negotiating so we fell out about that when we moved in together. Protip: divide responsibilities up in whatever way seems equitable to you both (preferably before you move in), try it out for a bit and review. Sounds dry but it worked for us. \n\nQuality time was a big one. My wife is more introverted than me so being content sitting alone in a room together was easier for her than me back then. It's not that I didn't enjoy her company; I'm just more independent/active and a very loyal friend who likes bigger groups. It sounds weird but I wasn't as comfortable with exclusive couple-y together time as I am now. I just didn't know how to do it, and I didn't get why it would be pleasurable for her. (Now of course, it's ace!) \n\nAnd sex... Ho ho ho. We'd been raised with very different views, me not shy about bodies and reasonably well informed, her having been left totally in the dark. Her parents pulled her out of sex ed, no sex/puberty talk, self discovery is bad etc. (and they weren't religious or anything. They just didn't want to deal with her burgeoning womanhood). \n\nSo we made the decision when we got engaged to read loooots of sex and relationship books. We needed to get accustomed to an integral part of the relationship. There was definitely some giggling and \"you do *what!??*\"...I still had unrealistic expectations of hot sex all day every day even though I had no clue how to do it or how much I'd have to put in in other areas to get it! \n\nOur wedding night was an *epic* fail, but we made up for that in the weeks and months that followed \ud83d\ude00 Lots of awkward, talky, loving, encouraging, steadily improving, \"*hey this is getting really good now, isn't it?*\" sex. \n\nSo there was plenty of emotional immaturity on the one hand, but you learned very quickly the beauty and necessity of patience, understanding, compromise and forgiveness - it was essentially a crash course, and in my eyes these things are the mark of a healthy relationship. They definitely greased the wheels in the early days. \n\nWe still read relationship books now (you may, quite fairly, consider this 'catching up'). As rookies, we liked that we could get a third, 'neutral' perspective on things (sometimes there were moments of \"is this what it's supposed to look like? Are we adulting yet?\"). For example, it helped us mutually agree explicit rules on how to fight fair. I'm not saying we always, always stick to them or that other couples couldn't just work out a code of conduct by themselves, but for us it meant that we didn't fall back on models from past/other people's relationships that may not be the best fit. \n\nAnd even though we might be behind in some areas, we get to *really* celebrate each other's growth, which is always nice. I feel privileged to have found someone who accepted me and was willing to work at all of this without judging or rejecting me.
