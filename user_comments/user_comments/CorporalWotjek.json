I do think there's something more intrinsic to sport that fuels the human drive to participate and compete than crocheting, insofar as it's about moving your body (because almost everyone is able-bodied) in ways that immediately demonstrate skill, burn energy, arouse adrenaline, stimulate endorphins, restore health etc., whereas crocheting (which I do agree is an undervalued form of art, especially compared to painting which has historically been dominated by men and has enjoyed more prestige because of it) just doesn't come as naturally to the human body. Sport is simply a greater necessity to human functioning than art is, absent any comparisons between women and men (in the same way that men don't care about how gorillas can outlift them, I don't care about men's performance by the same token), women still need to move. Just like with any other pursuit almost everyone engages in (e.g. the education system, dating), more people = more incentive and more avenues for competition.\n\nPlus the modern consensus that art is subjective which complicates the selection of a winner; *plus* the fact that in sports, the competition is the event itself, whereas live-crocheting just wouldn't be that thrilling to watch; *plus* the fact that humans are naturally tribalistic, and team sports in particular feed into that tendency (for better or for worse) in an easy way with the in-built formation of 1v1 teams. I'll happily concede that the voyeuristic culture of professional sports is fucking weird (in the same way that idol culture is weird), inasmuch as some people will happily watch re-runs after re-runs of football matches without ever stepping on the football field themselves; I'll also concede that the popular types of competitive sports that society at large has come to rally around would probably differ by a bit or by a lot in a matriarchal society, perhaps prioritising sports like gymnastics more, but one can only wonder.

Even outside of sport, there\u2019s no better way to spur innovation, discipline, achievement, camaraderie than competition. Competition doesn\u2019t have to be antithetical to cooperation; the notion of sportsmanship itself (regardless of how much that plays out in reality) is centred around the activity of sport. Within sports, there\u2019s something transcendental about following an athlete\u2019s sacrifice and grit against untold obstacles that\u2019s every bit as humanising as some works of fiction (especially because the stakes are both so high yet in some ways artificial); Hidilyn Diaz stole my heart in the last Summer Olympics with how she won Philippines\u2019 first gold and pulled the entire nation together in celebration of her historic victory. Some of the experiences I\u2019ve had while playing sports competitively have been instrumental in reshaping my perspective on life, e.g. that just because they play on the opposite team doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re your enemy.\n\nI will concede that there are massive problems with the industry of professional sports (like the abandonment of Olympic venues to economic rot and space wastage year after year, or the slave labour implicated in the construction of gigantic air-conditioned stadiums in Qatar for the 2022 World Cup), but I reject that these aren\u2019t problems with national egotism and capitalist commodification first and foremost. If your only problem with professional sport is their environmental impact, there are plenty of sports that don\u2019t require terraforming huge swathes of land and are closer to carbon-neutral (I do think some sports are way worse than others, like how golf is basically inseparable from deforestation with the aim of creating monocultures of sterile grass, for the enjoyment of mostly millionaires and billionaires at all levels of skill).

Their true hatred is directed at the \u201cliberal elite\u201d (this divides into various branches: the \u201cHollywood elite,\u201d the \u201cjournalistic elite,\u201d \u201cuniversity elite,\u201d \u201cfancy lawyers,\u201d or \u201cthe medical establishment\u201d)\u2014that is, the sort of people who live in big coastal cities, watch public television or public radio, or even more, who might be involved in producing or appearing in same. It seems to me there are two perceptions that lie behind this resentment: (1) the perception that members of this elite see ordinary working people as a bunch of knuckle-dragging cavemen, and (2) the perception that these elites constitute an increasingly closed caste; one which the children of the working class would actually have far more difficulty breaking into than the class of actual capitalists.\n\n> It also seems to me that both these perceptions are largely accurate. The first is pretty much self-evidently true if reactions to the 2016 election of Donald Trump are anything to go by. The white working class in particular is the one identity group in America toward which statements that might otherwise be immediately denounced as bigoted (for instance, that a certain class of people are ugly, violent, or stupid) are accepted without remark in polite society. The second is also true if you really think about it. We might again look to Hollywood for an illustration. Back in the thirties and forties, even the name \u201cHollywood\u201d would tend to evoke images of magical social advance: Hollywood was a place where a simple farm girl could go to the big city, be discovered, find herself a star. For present purposes, it doesn\u2019t really matter how often this actually happened (it clearly did now and then); the point is at the time, Americans did not see the fable as inherently implausible. Look at a list of the lead actors of a major motion picture nowadays and you are likely to find barely a single one that can\u2019t boast at least two generations of Hollywood actors, writers, producers, and directors in their family tree. **The film industry has come to be dominated by an in-marrying caste. Is it surprising, then, that Hollywood celebrities\u2019 pretensions to egalitarian politics tend to ring a bit hollow in the ears of most working-class Americans?** Neither is Hollywood in any way an exception in this regard. If anything it\u2019s emblematic of what has happened to all the liberal professions (if, perhaps, a trifle more advanced).\n\n> Conservative voters, I would suggest, tend to resent intellectuals more than they resent rich people, because they can imagine a scenario in which they or their children might become rich, but cannot possibly imagine one in which they could ever become a member of the cultural elite. If you think about it that\u2019s not an unreasonable assessment. A truck driver\u2019s daughter from Nebraska might not have very much chance of becoming a millionaire\u2014America now has the lowest social mobility in the developed world\u2014but it could happen.

One of the hallmarks of the femme fatale trope is the apparent subversion of who wields power in the sexual relationship, and at the end of the day, the femme fatale is usually allowed to go her own way, to be childless, to be independent, to be beholden to no man, etc. \n\nThe portrayals of femme fatales are also rather mixed\u2014there are the cringe ones like Black Widow and the Hulk, where her infertility is made out to be her Achilles\u2019 heel, and it\u2019s really not clear why she goes for him at all, other than that he\u2019s there; but there are also portrayals where it\u2019s clear the only undesirable aspect of the character is the man\u2019s inability to conquer her, albeit tempered by her coquettishness, which holds up decently enough from a tenuous feminist lens. And there are femme fatales who aren\u2019t even coquettish or promiscuous! Often if you read between the lines, it\u2019s male entitlement that presumes she must be inviting him in by virtue of existing as a sexy woman. One example that leaps to mind is Poison Ivy\u2014of course it\u2019s DC Comics so you\u2019re going to get mixed portrayals\u2014but generally she alone already surfaces a far more in-depth character, with motivations and desires independent of men, than most girl-next-door\u2019s. When I think of Poison Ivy, I don\u2019t think of how sexy she is, but of the moral dilemmas she surfaces in her the-ends-justify-the-means approach in terraforming the world\u2014something you\u2019d never get with girl-next-door\u2019s, who are inherently too bland to provoke ethical dissertation.\n\nSo while yes, both the girl-next-door and the femme fatale primarily exist through the male gaze, once you strip away the male gaze, their relationship to the male lead, and analyse the actual characteristics surfaced of each, it becomes apparent that the femme fatale is significantly more aspirational from a feminist perspective in the traits she represents: namely, assertiveness and autonomy.", "created_utc": "1605895579.0", "edited": "1605896409.0", "id": "gcyow33", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_jxpu1o", "parent_id": "t1_gcymlh6", "score": "34", "subreddit": "Kibbe", "subreddit_id": "t5_22m7gw"}, {"author": "CorporalWotjek", "body": "> girl-next-doormat \n\n\ud83e\udd23", "created_utc": "1605894808.0", "edited": "False", "id": "gcyn9yo", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_jxpu1o", "parent_id": "t1_gcyj0na", "score": "1", "subreddit": "Kibbe", "subreddit_id": "t5_22m7gw"}, {"author": "CorporalWotjek", "body": "Lmfao ew.

When I look at [Margot Robbie] (https://www.pinterest.com/pin/430586414368514256/), [Princess Diana of Wales] (https://www.vogue.in/fashion/gallery/28-pictures-of-diana-princess-of-wales-in-stunning-summery-outfits-royal-style?image=5ec61a4e5ad135573cfd3d46) (scroll down to image 3), [Nicole Kidman] (https://www.popsugar.com/celebrity/Nicole-Kidman-Bikini-Beach-Sydney-2016-40860478), and [Katy Perry] (http://www.celebzz.com/katy-perry-bikini-candids-beach-amalfi-italy/) in their own skin and hardly anything else, \u201cFree Spirit\u201d is NOT the essence that comes to mind. Sure, they *look* relaxed because all of them are at the beach! That\u2019s what you\u2019re supposed to do there! But what I see immediately is their athleticism and their power, a different sort of power than the one we\u2019re taught Dramatics possess, but power nonetheless. Some of them even look downright Amazonian. \u201cFree Spirit\u201d seems too wispy and insubstantial an essence to bequeath to Naturals, considering they\u2019re the body type who read as having the most *physical* presence out of all the body types, if height is taken into account and evened out.", "created_utc": "1601916903.0", "edited": "False", "id": "g7szp6x", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_j5iabv", "parent_id": "t1_g7sqclu", "score": "9", "subreddit": "DressForYourBody", "subreddit_id": "t5_2o7ors"}, {"author": "CorporalWotjek", "body": "They love claiming lifelong vegetarians as their own too, to push the thread that veganism has always been practicable.

It may well give you the answers you're looking for.\n\nFor instance, the difference between an INTJ's Ni-Te-Fi-Se function stack vs. an INFJ's Ni-Fe-Ti-Se function stack is that an INTJ prefers to extrovert their thinking and introvert their feeling, meaning they prefer to share their objective thoughts and find consensus on those, while thinking \"my feelings, my business\", sometimes even to the point of believing their feelings/values to be a distraction to their Te. An INFJ prefers to extrovert their feeling and find consensus on those (e.g. by soothing disharmony in the group, as the INFJs I know have been weirdly bothered by (to me) when they couldn't achieve it), while preferring to keep their more logical thoughts to themselves (perhaps for the sake of the former goal when they conflict? tbh, I find this behaviour incomprehensible being an INTJ myself, but this seems like it matches your profile).\n\nIn contrast, someone with an Fi-Te stack to rival the INFJ's Fe-Ti stack will not model their feelings/values by correspondence with the group, but may even take pleasure in and go out of their way to encourage e.g. their divergent morality or individuality. They also frequently don't care about bringing the group's emotions into a comfortable harmony as much as an Fe-dom/Fe-aux user cares to. A lot of Fe users may find this selfish, while Fi users may regard the Fe user's pursuits with the attitude of \"why bother?\" since they believe each person is responsible for their own emotional state.\n\nI also find it interesting to note the terms you used even in typing up your post\u2014'brutally honest', 'morale', 'ideal person who tries to help the world'...when I was questioning my type, I was subconsciously concerned with more objective terms like 'truth', 'framework', etc. \n\nSpeaking anecdotally, I do think people cluster around people who are like them\u2014most of my friend group are N's, by nature of the field I work in. Most of my friends also happen to be dating people who are at most one cognitive function away from their type e.g. INFJ-INFJ matches, ENFP-ENTP matches, INTP-ISTP matches, etc. Speaking even more anecdotally, all the INFJ's I know have also been weirdly into penguins, but you probably shouldn't rely on that for anything. \n\nFeel free to ask me if you have more questions!", "created_utc": "1589981855.0", "edited": "1589982972.0", "id": "fr8m2dz", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_gn14ps", "parent_id": "t3_gn14ps", "score": "1", "subreddit": "personality_tests", "subreddit_id": "t5_2t9rh"}, {"author": "CorporalWotjek", "body": "Srs I was about to comment the same.
