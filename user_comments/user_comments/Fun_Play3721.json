I also remember going to the cinema the day twilight came out and watching the 10am screening with my friends, the first screening of the day (there was no midnight showing at our cinema). We all went and got lunch and then went again that same day for the 3pm showing to watch it again. I would read the books and then lend them to my friends and we would spend all day talking about it. \n\nThe downside was we were ridiculed in the media as being crazy and obsessive. Mainly by fully grown men and other young girls who were \u201ctoo cool for twilight\u201d. It was open season on anyone who was a fan which I think pretty terrible. Everyone was suddenly the \u201crole model police\u201d and said the book was full of bad role models. I don\u2019t remember Harry Potter being called a bad role model when that was in its prime. But because it was a book popular with young girls we had to made fun of it? Why do people have to have a go at young girls for being excited about something?
