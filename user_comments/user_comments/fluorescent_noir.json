She set out immediately to minimize the severity of the situation by making it clear to Kyle that she viewed her feelings and the entire situation as a joke.

We have seen friendships broken and destroyed on these shows, only to then see those same women make up and take down another wife together in an unexpected alliance in the very next season, but suddenly the same viewers of these shows where that has happened all along suddenly feel the need to pretend that they're morally opposed to watching a show like this - though they still tune in weekly. \n\nThe same people who claim to be over the bullying behaviors exhibited on the show are ABSOLUTELY policing the narrative and conversations in fan spaces as well - and resort to even uglier behaviors if you dare to point out that the rhetoric is getting to be a bit over the top.

You can't even talk about moments that make you laugh anymore without someone chiming in to tell you that you're wrong somehow for finding humor or any type of enjoyment in these shows. \n\nI was told by a moderator in another housewives community that they understand this type of rhetoric is becoming a problem, but they won't do anything to limit it or set rules to try and curb it because these angry voices get more engagement and clicks than the previous calmer, level-headed analyses that these shows used to receive. \n\nTL;DR: all that is to say, you're right, and the viewers that cannot dissociate themselves from this show and the fandom absolutely fucking suck.", "created_utc": "1662061948.0", "edited": "False", "id": "impb4td", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_x3few2", "parent_id": "t3_x3few2", "score": "1", "subreddit": "BravoRealHousewives", "subreddit_id": "t5_2v6dk"}, {"author": "fluorescent_noir", "body": "AVP exists.

But when he returns, the first thing Amy tries to do is sleep with him. That alone wouldn't be so terrible, if it was not treated so flippantly by the writing. The Doctor never tells Amy no, Amy never acknowledges that she has a fiance that she has betrayed, etc. \n\nThen River's episodes sort of begin to devlove into a similar state where each time she returns she is flandardized a bit more into being a loud, flirtatious charmer. In Silence in the Library she calls the Doctor Sweetie, but beyond that she really is shown to be a driven and capable archeologist/scientist on a mission. In later episodes it often feels that her intellect is put on a back burner and her flirtatious side is turned up to an 11 - pardon the pun. She's constantly flirting with Matt Smith's doctor and a lot of times it just felt like \"enough already.\" Thankfully, I do think that she was done right in the Husbands of River Song. \n\nThen there's one off characters like Tasha Lem, who the Doctor goes to see completely naked and who definitely has a thing for the Doctor.

The app will give you a word like \"Vendr\u00e1\" and will let you pick from several film clips using that word in a sentence. You can pick the sentence that you like the most, or feel is most applicable/you may use in real life, and add it to your learning deck. For example, I picked: \"No s\u00e9 qu\u00e9 es lo que vendr\u00e1\" The app gives you the sentence first in spanish, and when you think you know it you can click to advance and it will give you it in English below. The card gets added to your learning deck and will return every few days to quiz you on how well you've retained it. It's an awesome app that I feel really helped boost my learning.\n\nSecondly, I use **ClozeMaster**. This is an app that will quiz you with 10 sentences per round. They provide a nearly complete Spanish sentence, missing one word, and the english translation below. You have to either type in or choose the missing word in Spanish. This is another really great app in that the sentences it provides you are true to life and ones that will come up in daily conversation.\n\nI hope this helps!

I've brought this up a couple of times recently in various fan spaces. It's not just movies - it's every fan space for media. Tv shows, movies, video games. Dialogue on social media about media in general has become almost relentlessly negative over the last 4 or 5 years due to the rise of social media accounts that rip content apart for sport. \n\nPeople who may have really enjoyed a movie, tv show, or video game upon first viewing, will wander into a fan discussion space to find a vocal minority who will stop at nothing to tell them how terrible said media is, and how they're incorrect for liking it. For example, you can't go into a fan space about Doctor Who without someone linking you to a 5 hour long video on YouTube made by a \"superfan\" of the series, whose sole mission is to tear the current iteration of the show apart and tell people how terrible it is. \n\nPeople have internalized the idea that in order to be a savvy media critic, you have to be almost relentlessly negative about said media - because it's those negative opinions that end up having the loudest voice and furthest reach. People who enjoy stuff are often less vocal about it. They may show up in a thread and write one positive comment, whereas the vocal minority will comment 15 times in the same thread, or create a 5 hour long video for their similarly negative followers online to share. \n\nDiscussing media in general online nowadays, you run the risk of brainwashing yourself out of enjoying something you may have enjoyed prior to entering that space. I may not love every second of a movie or show I watch, but I still glean enjoyment out of it 9 times out of 10, or I turn it off and move onto something else.

I definitely think you need a thick skin, a lot of empathy and certain type of personality to do well in my particular line of work. Not to say that I have a great personality - it just does well in a patient facing context like mine, trying to resolve issues. I definitely don't achieve that goal of having a positive conversation with every patient or their family member every time, but I am also really good at setting boundaries and expectations with people.\n\nIf someone is getting particularly belligerent, I usually rely on trying to hold up a mirror to their behaviors with something like: \"gee, you know I'm hearing your frustrations about X and have some additional questions for you about this, but in order to continue this conversation I'd just like to ask that you lower your voice and show me the same level of respect I'm affording to you.\" Usually, that works. If it doesn't, I hit 'em quick with a \"I'm sorry, but this is no longer a productive conversation. Please feel free to call back later to discuss your concerns when you're ready to have a conversation with me about this.\" And disconnect the call or end the meeting.", "created_utc": "1640030971.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hpc2tpi", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_rkoskd", "parent_id": "t1_hpc223m", "score": "21", "subreddit": "HermanCainAward", "subreddit_id": "t5_35e6ns"}, {"author": "fluorescent_noir", "body": "Yes it is actually.

It helps restore trust and make moving forward with care decisions easier.\n\nThat being said, the most challenging aspect of this job has been retaining emotional and intellectual empathy for anti-vaxxers. Once upon a time, anti-vax conspiracy theories were relegated to nuts like Jenni McCarthy, but our political climate since COVID began has emboldened the entire Right to make staunch refusal of vaccination a facet of their personality. They are the most challenging patients to deal with clinically, and administratively. When people say that this is now a pandemic of the unvaccinated, they absolutely mean it.\n\nThese are people who are proud of their lack of critical thinking skills and lack of education. They feel empowered by their echo chambers online and by Right wing media - both of which fully abandon their follower the second they find themselves in the hospital with COVID, fighting for their life.
