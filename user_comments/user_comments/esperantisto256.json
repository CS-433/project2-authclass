Materials science is very important in structural applications.\n\nIf you want to do transportation, ENGRD 2110 makes a lot of sense, since transportation systems engineering makes use of a lot of coding.\n\nIf you want to do water resources or hydrology, then 2210 makes sense, since thermo is important for water stuff.\n\nAlso, you can use any ENGRD, so don\u2019t rule out ENGRD 2250 if you\u2019re into earth science, which is definitely still relevant for civil!
