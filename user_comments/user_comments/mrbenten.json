She has gotten *a lot* better, but her progress has very much not been linear. This morning she was running ahead of me a lot more because we were at my parents house for the first time, but the afternoon walk was much much better (probably because she was used to the street now).\n\nI walk her 4 times a day and I basically treat each walk like a training walk. In that:\n\n- if she started pulling I would immediately stop. Sometimes I would just wait, or I\u2019d call her back to me and only move forward then. If she was having a particularly difficult time I would just turn around immediately and walk the other direction. I had to be obnoxiously consistent with this\u2014 I would stop even if we were 5 feet from my door if she started pulling.\n- When she got better at coming back to me when the leash was taut, I started doing full resets. Meaning every time she would pull on the leash I would call her to me, have her sit, and only then start moving.\n- right now I\u2019m finding a lot of success by calling her name anytime she starts walking in front of me (but the leash is still loose). If she looks at me when I call her name I\u2019d pull out a treat and hold it at my hip and she\u2019d back herself up.\n- a metric shit ton of treats. Anytime she\u2019d look at me, was somewhat close to my side, came back to me. I would always make sure to hold the treat a little behind my back so she\u2019d have to back up to get it.\n- I also started lengthening the amount of time in between pulling out the treat and giving it to her. I\u2019d pull out the treat, if she was a little ahead of me she\u2019d back up, and then I\u2019d hold it above her head for a little bit longer than the previous few times, forcing her to walk right beside me until I lowered the treat. If she looked away I would call her name to get her eyes back on me.\n- I\u2019ve been doing pretty much all of my walks over the span of one block. New areas are still really difficult for her, so I\u2019ve just been going up and down the same block with her so she\u2019s not distracted by new things on the walk, whether the walks 5 minutes or an hour. If she\u2019s doing particularly well I\u2019ll walk somewhere new, but if she\u2019s clearly having a lot of trouble staying focused on me I just leave (do not do not do not force it if it clearly isn\u2019t working where you are).\n\nThis walk was easily her best walk yet (it was the first time she was genuinely heel walking!). But like I said she\u2019s definitely still got a ways to go before she can do this consistently\u2014 just hoping it gets more and more consistent the more we try.\n\nEDIT: also\u2014 I\u2019m using a 4ft long leash that\u2019s pretty thick and has some elasticity. I\u2019ve found the shorter length a lot better at getting her to learn to stick close to me, and the fact that it has some elasticity makes it hard for her to pull because it pulls her back a little. Just guessing here but the fact that it\u2019s so thick too I think makes her more aware of the leash as it\u2019s getting taut & gives me a better line of communication with her without being harsh.", "created_utc": "1665513778.0", "edited": "1665515534.0", "id": "irx8shx", "is_submitter": "True", "link_id": "t3_y1e4dm", "parent_id": "t1_irx4h0n", "score": "217", "subreddit": "Dogtraining", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r067"}, {"author": "mrbenten", "body": "How frequent is recommended?", "created_utc": "1665256617.0", "edited": "False", "id": "irjnpk5", "is_submitter": "True", "link_id": "t3_xyxnb5", "parent_id": "t1_irjnknj", "score": "2", "subreddit": "pitbulls", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qjof"}, {"author": "mrbenten", "body": "I didn\u2019t take it out at all\u2014 I just squeezed it in my pocket.

Not because English is *easy*, but because having English as you first language makes learning almost another other 2nd language much harder. I think there are two main reasons for this, one being what you mentioned in your post, that it's incredibly easy to expose yourself to English, even when you aren't trying two. The other reason being that English just doesn't have nearly as many rules as other languages do.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTake the word *walk*, for example. In the present tense, there is only one other variation of it: third person singular (*he/she walks*). The past tense conjugation is *walked*, regardless of gender, pronoun, or quantity. The future? Just throw a *will* before it (and this is true for all English verbs). Infinitive? *To walk*, which again, works for every single verb. And walk as a noun, as in, *I'm going on a walk*, bears no difference to the verb. In practice, the only conjugations we need to remember are walk, walks, walked, and walking.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLet's use the same verb, walk, in my main TL, Hebrew, for comparison.\n\nto walk -- \u05dc\u05dc\u05db\u05ea (lalechet).     \n\nwalk (present male singular) -- \u05d4\u05d5\u05dc\u05da (holech).    \n\nwalk (present female singular) -- \u05d4\u05d5\u05dc\u05db\u05ea (holechet).    \n\nwalk (present male plural) -- \u05d4\u05d5\u05dc\u05db\u05d9\u05dd (holchim).   \n\nwalk (present female plural) -- \u05d4\u05d5\u05dc\u05db\u05d5\u05ea (holchot).    \n\nI walked -- \u05d4\u05dc\u05db\u05ea\u05d9 (halachti).    \n\nyou walked (male singular) --- \u05d4\u05dc\u05db\u05ea (halachta).   \n\nyou walked (female singular) -- \u05d4\u05dc\u05db\u05ea (halacht).   \n\nyou walked (male plural) -- \u05d4\u05dc\u05db\u05ea\u05dd (halachtem).     \n\nyou walked (female plural) -- \u05d4\u05dc\u05db\u05ea\u05df (halachten).     \n\nhe walked -- \u05d4\u05dc\u05da (halach).   \n\nshe walked -- \u05d4\u05dc\u05db\u05d4 (halcha).     \n\nthey walked -- \u05d4\u05dc\u05db\u05d5 (halchu).     \n\nwe walked -- \u05d4\u05dc\u05db\u05e0\u05d5 (halachnu).    \n\nI will walk -- \u05d0\u05dc\u05da (elech).   \n\nyou will walk (male singular) -- \u05ea\u05dc\u05da (telech).   \n\nyou will walk (female singular) -- \u05ea\u05dc\u05db\u05d9 (telchi).   \n\nyou will walk (male plural) -- \u05ea\u05dc\u05db\u05dd (telchem).   \n\nyou will walk (female plural) -- \u05ea\u05dc\u05db\u05df (telchen).    \n\nhe will walk -- \u05d9\u05dc\u05da (yelech).    \n\nshe will walk -- \u05ea\u05dc\u05da (telech).    \n\nthey will walk -- \u05d9\u05dc\u05db\u05d5 (yelchu).   \n\nwe will walk -- \u05e0\u05dc\u05da (nelech).   \n\nwalk! (command male singular) -- \u05dc\u05da (lech).   \n\nwalk! (command female singular) -- \u05dc\u05db\u05d9 (lechi).    \n\nwalk!

Any language that has equivalents of *am walking* or *had walked* will have even more variations. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI know a lot of people will look at this as say that this is actually what makes English so difficult; sure, other languages have a lot of rules, but once you learn them, you're pretty much set. But English has exception after exception to learn, and many of them for no discernible reason whatsoever. However, I actually think that this is what makes English easier to learn than it's counterparts. If you say *\"I drived\"* in conversation, everyone will understand exactly what you mean. People will correct you, and eventually, you'll stop making those mistakes. And since English only has a couple general rules, you are able to start speaking very early on. Incorrectly? Sure. But you will still be able to communicate, and learning any language becomes so much easier once you are able to speak with natives. Whereas in a language like Hebrew, you straight up *cannot communicate* unless you are able to make and recognize all of these conjugations, that exist for *every single verb* in the language. A native Hebrew speaker will be able to recognize all of these conjugations as the same word, but many learners will often feel as if some of these conjugations sound entirely different from one another. Truthfully, English speakers just are not used to learning and applying so many rules just to speak a language. We're used to learning a few rules, and picking up the rest as we go.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso, I think the whole \"learning languages from watching movies\" actually plays a larger role than most people would think, at least in explaining the level of fluency so many people have in English as a second language. My dad's Israeli, so all of my cousins in Israel are not native English speakers. Most of my cousins in the  younger generations speak English very well, because they learnt it in school from like the 1st grade, whereas many of the older members of my Dad's family speak very broken English at best. However, the two adults that speak English more fluently than anyone else are both in their late 40s (kind of on the border of both generations). When I asked them how they learned English so well, they both accredited it to the fact that growing up they watched tons and tons of American movies.

The languages I\u2019ve learned tend to have a lot of rules with a few exceptions.\n\nFor example, the word *hope* can be both a noun and a verb in English. Past tense? Hoped, which is nearly identical to hope, and is the same regardless of the gender or pronoun of the subject. Future tense? Just shove the word *will* before it (and this is true for 100% of verbs). Infinitive? Just put the word *to* before the verb and you\u2019re done.\n\nIn Hebrew, the word for *hope* depends on a lot of factors:\n\nHope (noun) - tikvah.   \nTo hope - lekaveh.    \nI hope (female) - mekavah.    \nWe hope (male) - mekavim.   \nI hoped - kiviti.   \nYou will hope (female) - tikvi.   \nI will hope - ekaveh.\n\nNow you can probably notice the similarities between all of these words, and a native Hebrew speaker would recognize them all as conjugations of *hope* instantly, but I\u2019ve had so many instances where I though I didn\u2019t recognize a word, only to realize that it was just a conjugation I hadn\u2019t seen before. In English the conjugations are so similar and infrequent across verbs, outside of exceptions (like *speak* to *speech*), but in other languages there could be dozens of conjugations *per verb.*\n\nNow I know a lot of people say that this makes other languages easier, because you just learn the rules and you\u2019re done, but I\u2019ve always felt differently. English, IMO, is easy to learn, but hard to master. There aren\u2019t that many rules to learn, so you can start speaking fairly soon. If you say *drived* instead of *drove*, no one will be confused. You\u2019ll get corrected an eventually you\u2019ll stop making those mistakes. Whereas in Hebrew, you straight up *cannot communicate* without learning all of these conjugations first.

Most natives don\u2019t realize how many thousands of words stay dormant in their vocabulary, words they won\u2019t use for months or years at a time. It\u2019s not something you really start thinking about until you try to really master a second language, and mid conversation go \u201cwait, I don\u2019t know how to say \u2018forest.\u2019 That\u2019s a common word. I should know that.\u201d While C2s who live in the middle of the desert and haven\u2019t seen a tree in years will know how to say \u2018forest\u2019 in their language.\n\n3) I think there\u2019s a big difference in how people at a C2/native level react when they don\u2019t understand something. If I\u2019m at my doctor\u2019s office, and he starts uses terms I don\u2019t understand, I don\u2019t really get lost at all. I don\u2019t spend the next 10 seconds thinking \u201cWait, what does that word mean? Do I know that word? That sounds like a word I should know. Is this the first time I\u2019ve heard it?\u201d When this happens in my TL I sometimes go on this tangent and end up missing the rest of the sentence. In English I can immediately and without question identify the words that I\u2019m unfamiliar with.\n\nAll three of these things are things high school dropouts with limited grammar knowledge can do, but are incredibly difficult skills to pick up.", "created_utc": "1654106434.0", "edited": "False", "id": "iataacz", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_v2hd21", "parent_id": "t3_v2hd21", "score": "9", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "mrbenten", "body": "Absolutely not.
