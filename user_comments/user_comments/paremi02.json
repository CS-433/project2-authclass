For a rough estimation, I'll use the generous estimation that getting to A1 in ONE language will take you 2 months. Why, you may ask? Just because I've done it in less than that with languages that were similar to my native language, but I also know that learning languages that use a different writing system will take a lot more time than this, so I settled on 2 months to make my estimation easier to calculate. \n\nNow again, if we PRETEND that you study 30 languages for 2 months each, you will get to 30 in 5 years! Wow, that doesn't seem that bad. 15 years and maybe you will be at 90? Well it does not work that way. \n\nYou might have heard that you can't really forget a language. That statement is neither true or false. In my opinion it is near impossible to lose your listening comprehension in a language you reach high intermediate. Unfortunately that doesn't apply to languages you study very little. I have studied Spanish for 2 months in full immersion in a Spanish speaking country at age 8, and I never practiced it after. Lost it all. Of course I reactivated it by having classes throughout high school, and the time needed to ''relearn'' was way smaller than when I first learnt it, but I think you get my point. \n\nWhat I want to say is: the more you learn languages, the more the time required to learn a new one gets bigger, even if you're only studying the basics. There is a thing called ''maintaining'' your target(s) language(s), and that requires time. By the time you'd get to 10 languages you would have to spend probably 5 hours per week studying them to keep what you know (30 minutes each I think is a reasonable amount for keeping A1) and you would have to study your target language at probably 1h per day to make progress fast enough to reach A1 in a lapse of 2 months.\n\nNow take this example to 20 languages to maintain. That is 10 hours a week. This is just exponential. And here I just spoke about learning language by language, don't forget that there is a huge lack of resources for many many of them, some are so similar that you would mix them up, some have very complicated writing systems... \n\nI just wanna end this by saying that this estimation is probably very inaccurate, so don't quote me on any number I mentioned, this will vary from person to person, from which 100 languages you choose, etc", "created_utc": "1665009023.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ir7lkt2", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_xw9mod", "parent_id": "t1_ir7gzww", "score": "2", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "paremi02", "body": "I don\u2019t think you realize how huge of a task that is, even if you aim for  50, 30 or even 20% of your objective", "created_utc": "1665006662.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ir7g2by", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_xw9mod", "parent_id": "t1_ir7a0wi", "score": "3", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "paremi02", "body": "100 languages?? are you crazy?
