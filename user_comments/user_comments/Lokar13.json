If you are learning Japanese, there is a way to remove furigana and convert vertical text to horizontal with calibre so you can import novels.\n3. Get a multi button mouse (I use a Logitech G600) to program macros / key bindings so it's easier to move through vocab / pages.\n4. Listening while reading is really the magic sauce: Their TTS is fantastic if you have nothing else, but I'm finding using native audiobooks is the best.\n   1. Look for audiobooks on youtube, convert it to an MP3 and you can import them in with the text and the software will sync it together. (or just if lazy just use Picture in Picture to have it in the background while reading)\n5. Don't be afraid to hit the translation button, especially in the beginning. It's not a 1:1 perfect translation, but sometimes it just you don't realize you've missed something until ten pages later and you've lost the plot. Just a glance a the translated sentence will let me go \"oh wow\". And it's so quick, you can pause / repeat the audio and keep going without breaking flow.\n   1. Try a tiny sentence version of the L/R method - hit the audio, read along with the native sentence, then hit the audio again while reading the translation (and listening to the TL audio to try to pick out words), then read TL sentence again with the audio. Sounds tedious, but perfect for when you have chosen content that's above your level. (I had no business reading 2HA 8 months after starting Mandarin from scratch...but this method works if you *really* want to read a book)\n6. When you can't actively read, have the audio of content you've previously studied on as passive listening. On the phone, it's got a nice playlist that will track the text with the audio so you can glace down and follow along but can also multi task and not get lost if you aren't 100% paying attention.\n7. Join your TL language challenge every month for at least a year or two and try to stay to the top 10 (some languages are more popular than others.) And keep your streak! \n   1. It's easier to score \"coins\" in the beginning, but you have to do a lot of reading / listening to acquire a language. So, after than initial fun beginner stage, sticking with the challenges over the long haul gives you motivation to keep reading more and more to stay in the rankings.
