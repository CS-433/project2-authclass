[{"author": "frustratedlady15", "body": "I took some agency work in hotel housekeeping (UK) - I\u2019ve done Novotel and Premier Inn. Idk if its in the US, but novotel is a chain of 4 star \u2018business\u2019 kinda hotels, premier inn is maybe 2/3 star (based on location). Its demographic is business travellers and also people travelling for holidays. \n\nnever went back to Novotel but went back to Premier Inn several times - housekeeping work generally sucks, but at novotel they wanted us to do 40 rooms in an 8 hour shift, was during covid lockdown and we werent even told to exchange/wash the cups/mugs, just wipe them down with water and pillowcase (even if there was lipstick on the glass). \n\nAt premier inn, my list was like 18 rooms for an 8 hour shift. Glasses and cups were always exchanged. Premier Inn was 100% cleaner than novotel, although both hotels were changing bed linen, towels etc. between every guest. \n\nGranted, premier inn is one of the nicer \u2018budget\u2019 UK hotel chains, but i was totally shocked about novotel being gross, its marketed as a \u2018fancier\u2019 option for an exec/business traveller. \n\nIn general though, i wouldnt stay at a hotel if there was a single review saying bedbugs/dirty bedding.", "created_utc": "1666506411.0", "edited": "False", "id": "itffa9p", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_yb2mbb", "parent_id": "t1_itejxcg", "score": "5", "subreddit": "Frugal", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhbe"}, {"author": "frustratedlady15", "body": "Agreed", "created_utc": "1665382591.0", "edited": "False", "id": "irqd4ob", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_xzt24d", "parent_id": "t1_iro60sb", "score": "-1", "subreddit": "PetiteFashionAdvice", "subreddit_id": "t5_34m7m"}, {"author": "frustratedlady15", "body": "When I try to find UK gov information or nhs stuff it always defaults to american shit even if i add \u2018uk\u2019 or \u2018nhs\u2019 to the beginning/end.
