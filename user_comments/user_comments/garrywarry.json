With being diagnosed with something like bpd there comes an element of being special and validated in some way. A huge element of BPD is that it can develop from trauma and being invalidated so to finally have this reason and this group to belong to is important. To then have someone then say that those who fake disorders should all be categorised too makes you question your own legitimacy in your disorder and your own outward appearance (something that borderlines have their entire lives based on). Is that to say that a lot of these fakers are not BPD? No, chances are there are some. But all is a stretch, especially with the rates of a personality disorder being diagnosed being low. \n\nI personally think there are overlying traits, similar to how there are traits of BPD which cover into autism, or traits of autism which lie on their own. (For example sensory disorders). I also think that with social media we have a lot more people (kids especially) crying out for validation and willing to act in ways that they have not really learnt are unacceptable. Hopefully this will decline and these kids will realise though. \n\nWaffled a bit much but hopefully it was understandable. Source: diagnosed earlier this year with BPD after many years of problems.\n\nEdit : just read about malingering and BPD as had not heard of it before.

I worked through it though with support from my husband and doctors and things have been stable (as stable as can be for a functioning BPD person), in the last year I started a job which caused a lot of issues and I ended up like my 22 year old self.

I've given up the job and am again working on my mental health. \n\nI will be honest it is tough, but it's not something to be scared of. The diagnosis has actually given me some comfort in terms of being more aware of what is causing my problems and what I can do to solve it. I still get obsessive over people, my moods can change by the hour, I still very much split on people and on myself, and I most certainly still disassociate, but it's manageable.

A year or two back I was back in a primary school on placement and got to see how it has \"improved\" since my day. Now firstly they are actually teaching grammar in English. I left school only knowing what a noun and adjective were as the focus was not on grammar. Now they learn it from year 1. Other languages they start earlier too. For example french is now from year 4 (8/9) rather than year 7 (11/12) like my day. The quality however is still terrible though. Alot of teachers are standard primary teachers. They don't speak French and so rely on audio tapes and drilling and then worksheets to teach basic phrases. There was a 60 minute lesson on animals when I was there. They listened to an audio and then repeated then we're given a worksheet of match the animal to the name. A week later I saw a year 6 class do the exact same task. 2 years and no progression at all! \n\nI went to an international university and the first task we were given was to introduce ourselves in our native language.

It's a vicious cycle and time just makes it worse. \n\nI spent my childhood not caring about my teeth and then as a teenager had terrible depression and anxiety. I'd fall asleep with polos or gum in my mouth to help me sleep. It's a miracle I didnt choke. Since then my teeth at the back have literally crumbled or been removed due to infection. I last went to the dentist about 4 years ago and they estimated 35,000 dkk of treatment just on the teeth that were left. 3 have crumbled since then as even with government support we dont have any extra cash to pay for it. \n\nPeople assume we are stupid or junkies the moment they see our teeth. We dont smile on photos and even if people dont comment it's always on your mind to keep your mouth closed. I mumble alot to avoid opening my mouth properly. My daughter is now 6 and we do everything we can to teach her good habits. We sadly use ourselves as examples to show her what it can be like and I just hope her teeth are stronger than ours. \n\nI've sort of rambled here but people do assume this is a very American issue when it comes to dental costs but it's an industry that is costly in a lot of places and this needs to be changed.

It certainly makes a difference.\n\nThen there is the curriculum. The uk one though useful for guidance in what to teach is very overwhelming and has far too many knowledge requirements. This means so much less flexibility for lesson planning and personally I felt forced to use work sheets and textbooks just to cover the material, whereas over here (Denmark) there is more focus on the skills and a general knowledge of the topics. Lessons can be more hands on and can be changed as you go on and with the lack of testing until 8th grade there isnt as much pressure on pupils or teachers.\n\nLastly is the pupil behaviour. Teachers are respected a little more over here by parents and the general public and this carries down to the pupils. They know if they are really difficult then there will actually be consequences, something that seemed to lack when I was in the UK. Education matters to alot of the pupils (at least the ones I've taught) so it makes things alot easier in the classroom. This was in both the private and state schools here by the way. \n\nIf anything my main reason for wanting to go back to the UK is a combination of homesickness and that I sort of enjoy the challenge of the UK schools.

The language is a nightmare and the \"free\" courses aren't all that good depending on where you actually live. I went through 14 teachers in 6 months and then my school was sued for poor performance. Most people speak English in the populated areas so getting practice isn't easy. In the less populated areas the people aren't even social so it's just as hard. \n\nThe pay may be ok, but you pay higher taxes and before anyone says \"but free healthcare etc\", there are still waiting lists, dental is not free, mental health is available at a subsidised cost but still you have to pay. Prescriptions work on a scale that means they're not as expensive as you may find elsewhere but still nowhere cheap like the UK.\n\nEducation is ok again depending where you are. There is a real mentality that all kids should be speaking Danish and many teachers are not educated in how to teach bilingual children. The pressure is on for all kids to speak Danish and rather than allowing a child to master their home language first they would rather it not exist at all. Any kid lagging behind goes to a \"temporary\" class to catch up. Some kids I've seen have been in this class for 2 years showing no progress. All of which are non Danish for their mother tongues. And this is apparently quite common. I can only mention about the schools in my area though.\n\nThen there is the final point, personally I dont feel welcome here. I've been here for over 5 years now and have jumped through hoops of learning the language enough to communicate, integrating myself and my child into the Danish system, studying here and getting to know the life and I dont know if I want to stay.
