Congrats!\n\nAnyway, I liked the story. I think I would have prefered it if it had been set earlier, though, incorporated into one of the last two volumes, and slightly restructured and shortened to avoid repetition. As I've mentioned before, I didn't really like Gilbert and Violet's romance in the novels, and Transient Dream retroactively addresses some of the problems I had with it. E.g. after the train chapter in Book 2 we hardly ever see Gilbert and Violet just doing stuff together and developing their relationship as a couple, and some of the scenes we did get seemed to emphasize the power difference between them rather than reduce it. In this story, we finally get to see them have some fun together as a couple, thankfully mostly without Violet having relapses of overt subservience. Gilbert seems like a more developed character here, too. We get some scenes that show him as human, insecure and suffering from a fear of being left behind by those he loves, which is something we often got told before, but not shown enough imo. So I kinda felt like the novel series was a sock with a lot of holes in it and this story darned some of them. The end result is still lumpy, but servicable.\n\nThe structure of the story itself is quite...artsy, and I liked the contrast between Gilbert's life with and without Violet created by the alternating scenes, but I unfortunately don't have time to go into details right now.\n\n*The Queen*\n\nQ2: I think The Queen must be taking place between the last chapter of Ever After and the wedding. Violet and Gilbert are obviously on that grand tour she'd been talking about in that chapter, the one where she takes him to all the favorite places she visited for work. I think it must be before the wedding, because otherwise she would just have introduced Gilbert as her husband when Charlotte asked.\n\nSpeaking of which, I think Violet's answer is very strange here. After all, this must be after she told Gil she loved him (since a trip this long doesn't fit in anywhere else in the timeline). So it seems pretty weird, and very cold towards Gilbert, to introduce him as a former superior officer, when he's been courting her for at least 2 years and might already be her fiance.\n\nApart from that, this story mostly made me feel very sorry for Charlotte. I think she's one of the most well-written side characters in the LN canon, and I care for her enough to be sad that she's still isolated in the Fl\u00fcgel court and hasn't found any close friends.\n\nQ3: Oh, tons.

I'm under the impression that Dietfried gave Violet to Gilbert almost right after he got rescued and returned from the island where he'd gotten stranded, with only a short intermediate time period (a few weeks?) where the Navy's officer's corps used Violet to fight and kill captives for their amusement. She couldn't speak yet at the time (Gilbert's title and her name where her first words) and it looked like she'd been kept in a sack most of the time. \u201cYou\u201d at the beginning of VE-If looks like several months have passed since then. She already speaks in whole sentences and has a big vocabulary when it comes to military matters, and Dietfried seems to have gotten used to regularly grooming and instructing her. Also the first chapter mentions several naval maneuvers she's taken part in.\n\nHowever, I also have to admit that I'm a bit confused about this part of the timeline. I recently reread the Ever After C2 (the heist chapter), and it's got a short, awkhardly translated paragraph that makes it sound like Dietfried roamed battlefields with Violet. I didn't understand when and how that is supposed to have happened. For one thing, why would Dietfried, as a naval captain, run around on a battlefield in the first place? And when? It doesn't really fit in anywhere imo, so I wondered if it's just a mistranslation.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Do I sense a bit of author self insert into the deceased, introvert artist son or am I reaching?\n\nI don't know if it's reaching, but I got that feeling every time Akatsuki writes an artist. Dietfried, Oscar, Angela, unnamed dead guy...\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Would regular Violet say she would fight old age for Gilbert?\u00a0\n\nIf Gilbert himself were to express worry at dying, I think she might. However, mostly Linaria's desperation at the thought of his death strikes me as a deliberate parallel between her and the older Violet in the heist chapter. When Dietfried mentions that Gilbert will die before her, Violet tells him that she'll keep on living as she's been ordered and keep writing letters to Gilbert even if he doesn't get them. The reason why she's so composed is that she's found letter writing as a coping mechanism for grief and she's gotten a broader sense of perspective. She's had to help other people deal with grief in her job as an AM Doll and has obviously already thought about it and come to terms with the fact that it's inevitable. For 14-y.o. Linaria, on the other hand, the thought is new and incredibly frightening. She's completely focused on Dietfried as the center of her existence and has never been apart from him for more than a day since he found her.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>I could believe Flavia's suggestions\n\nWho's Flavia?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>(Teck translates something as \"sexy man Dietfried.\" Is this\u00a0ikemen?)\n\nDennou's translation says Dietfried is \u201coozing the sex appeal of an adult man\u201d. That sounds like it comes from a more complicated phrase than just \u30a4\u30b1\u30e1\u30f3.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>So do these booklets show that Gilbert didn't actually end up doing that much to \"make Violet\" into a human?\u00a0\n\nI think so. The stories show that Violet was never really meant to be the beast she thinks she is. She has a couple of innate good qualities that make her predisposed to learn quickly and get accustomed to being around other humans as soon as someone gives her the slightest chance. While reading this, I sometimes wished she could read this story herself. It might improve her self-image.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>what is Linaria's relationship with Dietfried here? She's still his employee and he's still her master. \\[...\\] She was actually fine being unhealthily attached to someone all this time?\u00a0\n\nI think this is all part of Dietfried's contraditory nature. He loves Linaria (which for him means that he loves the feeling of being needed that she gives him). So he adopts her to bind her to him after the war, but this is too much closeness for his comfort-zone, so he immediately starts distancing himself again by telling her she's nothing but an employee. Which is clearly not true, because two minutes ago, he was stroking her hair and thinking about how much he'd like her to cry at his funeral.\n\nSo no, I don't think she's actually \u201cfine\u201d fine.

Oh well...\n\nQ1: I liked the relationship between Dietfried and Violet a great deal. It felt beautifully nuanced to me and turned both of them into more 3-dimensional characters in my mind. The only possible answer as to what it actually *is*, is probably \"Whatever Dietfried currently wants it to be\". Dietfried has conflicting needs when it comes to relationships - he hates the idea of commitment and responsibilities because he feels hemmed in by them, but at the same time, he has a constant need to be reassured that he's needed. So he forces the people who love him into a perverse back-and-forth dance where he withdraws and gets cranky when he needs space and needles them into giving him proof of affection when he's insecure and wants to feel loved.\n\nIn the novels, we've already seen him do this to Gilbert a few times, most notably on Gil's first day of Army training (Gaiden C5), when Dietfried comes to see him off and then brings him to the verge of tears by leaving early and taunting him that he should break off contact entirely. In the If-verse, his relationship with You/Lineria goes through different phases and also increasingly shows this pattern. At first, he doesn't realize that she's fully human. In this phase, even though she's useful to his military career, he's frustrated because he thinks she doesn't need him. So he starts to needle away at her to get her to show some sort of emotion, as evidenced by the conversation they have while shopping in Leiden.\n\nAfter he tries to leave her and it gets blatantly obvious that she does need him, he gets more openly affectionate towards her, but also his flip-flopping between hot and cold behavior gets worse. So it seems that the more Dietfried cares about someone, the more he unloads his emotional baggage on them. Scenes that stand out are when he makes her cry by talking about his impending death (lol) and the epilogue scene in VE-If, where he gets clingy and passive-aggressive as he starts to fear that she likes Gilbert more than him.\n\nAs for the relationship between Lineria and Gilbert, the story doesn't give us many clues. Dietfried seems to think that they're falling in love and it seems to make him jealous in the end...but it's entirely up the the reader to decide if that's just self-centered paranoia on his part or not. Personally, I don't think there's any  romance in this story (just some potential for future romance with both Bougainvillea brothers if you squint), and I like it. For one thing, since the story ends shortly after the war, I doubt Lineria is older than 15 at the end, so any mention of dating would have icked me right out the door. For another, I didn't like the romance parts in the main timeline, so I was just happy that I got to read this well-written character study of a toxic dick trying to raise a vulnerable girl without any parts where the author tried to force me to see things I found problematic or cheesy as romantic.\n\nWhat we do know is that Gilbert first took an interest in Lineria, because he felt that Dietfried was abusing her and felt responsible for putting a stop to it. This dynamic is the same as in the main timeline, where he also only took Violet with him, because he felt he couldn't leave her with Dietfried. In this timeline, he couldn't take her with him because she was already too firmly attached to Dietfried, so I think he did the next best thing \u2013 meeting with her as often as possible, and introducing her to Hodgins so that she would have more stable adults in her life. I also like to think that Gilbert and Lineria have been bonding over their shared experience of dealing with Dietfried's tough love, and their meetings are partially r/raisedbynarcissists support group meetings.\n\nQ2: If I had written this, I probably wouldn't have been able to resist the temptation to give Dietfried a full redemption arc and make him super nice at the end. I applaud Akatutski's decision to let him stay a dick.\n\nQ3: I mostly want more of *this* universe.

It could easily have been adapted, but I think it had too much thematic overlap with other episodes. I agree that the whole village party thing probably served as inspiration for ep4. But also, there are similarities between this and the Magnolias' story. In both cases, we got mothers who are dying and want to leave kind words behind for their children. Even though Silene's story has different stuff going on in the background and the added complication that his mother's mind is going to fail before her body does, a think it might have felt repetitive if they'd put it in the anime.\n\nLux's chapter...felt like a bunch of missed opportunities. What I was hoping for when I read it the first time was that this chapter would finally examine some of the darker aspects of love. Because love isn't all sunshine and flowers, obvs. It has a lot of problematic sides that are either completely missing from the anime (like toxic relationships, people pretending to love others to manipulate them, children loving abusive parents, one-sided obsession, jealousy, etc.) or mentioned but not really adressed (like Iris' parents being inappropriately overcontrolling towards their adult daughter or the co-dependancy aspect of Erika's love towards her alcoholic brother). So when I started reading this chapter and realized what was going on, I got optimistic and expected the story to focus on the \"dark love\" aspects: Lux grew up with the nuns who pretended to worship and love her and she saw them as parental figures, loved them back and internalized their faith and later felt that she owed it to them to die for their faith, and she has to overcome this by realizing that no matter if everything about their love was fake or not, she doesn't owe them her death and can live without guilt. Except...the story is so all over the place that in the end, I didn't even know if I'd really read something like that between the lines, or if I was just hallucinating it.\n\nIt felt frustratingly similar to Edwards Jones' chapter in some ways. With Jones, we also see some hints of the \"dark love\" theme, especially in the retelling of his time as a cult leader, where he uses his charisma to make his followers commit suicide. But again, it was blink and you miss it. Also, in both of these chapters, Akatsuki tries to draw parallels between Violet and her clients. With Jones, it was that both of them were killers for some army at some point. But the similarities fell apart too quickly, because he was also such an over-the-top giggly villain type character who clearly enjoyed killing and hurting others, so it was hard to see any non-superficial relevance in it.\n\nWith Lux, both her and Violet grew up in unusual, repressive environments where people took advantage of them. Violet must at some point have been brainwashed into following a superior's orders and thinking that she doesn't have the right to live if she's not useful (hence why she tells Gilbert \u201cI'm just a tool, you can leave me behind if I get broken\u201d every time she so much as stubs her toe). Just as Violet has been fighting the entire series to get beyond that and learn to live her own life, Lux has been raised to play the part of a demigod and to become a sacrifice. She also at first finds it impossible to imagine a life outside the Utopia, and has to come to the decision that she wants to leave and live, and then figure out how to do this. I  really liked this idea and I think it was at least executed a bit better than with Jones.I also cheered for Violet in the end, because it felt like she'd become a teacher figure and inspiration for this girl who had similar problems to hers... but the story doesn't put enough focus on it for my taste. The strange theory that demigods might exist and Violet might be one actually distracts from this, imo (as do the super repetitive descriptions where some character or other coos about how pretty Violet is. I can't tell you how sick I got of that during my first reading).\n\nSo, back to Q1: This chapter would have needed a complete reworking to fit in with the themes of the anime, and obviously the script writers would have had to decide what to do with Lux afterwards, so this would have been a hard chapter to adapt.", "created_utc": "1666521725.0", "edited": "1666522189.0", "id": "itfxziw", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_xavwj7", "parent_id": "t3_xavwj7", "score": "1", "subreddit": "VioletEvergarden", "subreddit_id": "t5_3fwmg"}, {"author": "DiverseUse", "body": ">I feel this may also be something lost in (cultural) translation, because I know similar expressions are common in Japanese despite most Japanese being something between Shintoist and agnostic.

I don't think it's a plural issue, though, because the first time God gets mentioned, the translation uses the words \"the guy called God\". This sounds like it was translated from some Japanese phrase that makes it clear it means the singular. In the end, I just took it to mean that Benedict uses \"God\" the same way someone else would use \"fate\" or something and shrugged it off.\n\nIn your other post, you also mentioned that it seems strange that Benedict still talks about Violet being cursed by God at a time where she's already pretty successful.

As far as his character development is concerned, the story picks up after the end of the first chapter. Violet got him out of the deep depression phase of his grief, but in this story, we learn that he has lingering feelings of guilt and attachment issues. Which he gradually overcomes with the aid of a girl who's conveniently just his perfect soulmate. One of the recurring themes of the series is that it's easier to express your feelings through letters, and that writing letters can be a healing experience and bring people together. Angela even takes this to the next level by putting her artwork on the envelopes, and it leads to her and Oscar bonding over their shared interests as artists of different kinds. I appreciated this little touch, and also that Oscar got a conclusion to his personal story of dealing with grief, but the story didn't really grip me.

Correct me if I get anything wrong.\n\nQ1: Leticia's story would have worked well for me as a stand-alone chapter about just another client, I think. But as a supporting narrative for Violet's final character arc, I didn't like it. Akatsuki tries very hard to draw parallels between Leticia chasing her dream of becoming a professional singer and Violet \"chasing\" her \"dream\" of confessing her love to Gil. The main reason why this didn't work for me is probably that Leticia's dream seemed like a real goal worth chasing, while Violet's sudden inferiority complex towards Gilbert seemed like a random and inexplainable step back for her in terms of character development. Gilbert and Violet have been dating for what... 2 years(?) at this point, he's been doting on her and she's become a well respected figure in Leidenschaftlich thanks to her job as a high profile AM doll. And yet she suddenly starts feeling that she's not good enough for him and that confessing her love is some major obstacle.\n\nWorse, after the promising letters of the last chapter, I had hoped that Gilbert would get some more much needed character development, but there was too little of it in this chapter, which focuses mostly on Violet again. Gilbert does a lot of running around and sitting on luxury trains, but not much interesting and new happens in his POV scenes. The conversation with Hodgins was cute, but mostly rehashes the same things already said in Gaiden chapter 5. I had hoped for a resolution in regards to his guilt about using Violet as a child soldier, but the way it was handled (Gil discussing it with Benedict instead of Violet) didn't work for me.\n\nQ2: I have no particular problem with open endings, but this ending just left me unsatisfied. Part of the reason why I picked up the LN was that I wasn't really a fan of the romance in the anime and people on this sub kept telling me that the LN was so much better. But I ended up disappointed, because the aspect that bothered me most was the power imbalance between Violet and Gil, and that's actually a lot worse in the LN. Even in the reunion scene, there's still a moment when Violet wants to go back to just following his orders. I can't decide if the ending is truly as bad as I remember, or if it just felt that way because it was the point where my hopes that certain things would still be addressed were dashed.\n\nQ3: I had so many issues with the LN, this would turn into a whine fest. I'll spare you.\n\nQ4: Least favorite...I don't now. This chapter is among my least favorites because of the disappointment effect, but there are probably chapters that deserve it more. E.g. the Edward Jones chapter, because it had so much potential to show a darker side of \"love\" but it was handled so badly.

What I don't understand is why this revelation doesn't tickle Violet's curiosity.

The only things you'd be missing is the charming little main street with cafes and stores for Miyajima-specific souvenirs, the ropeway to the \"mountain\" and possibly the chance to see the inside of Ikutsuhima shrine (though that one might actually be open a bit longer if you're travelling in the main season).\n\nIf it were me, I'd plan Friday night with a flexible agenda, so that Dotonbori is something you can spontaneously decide to skip if you don't feel like it. On my own trip to the region, it was raining for the entire 2.5 days I spent in Osaka. When I visited Dotonbori, it was looking kinda dreary in the rain, I wasn't hungry enough to enjoy the food, and after a total of 8 days in Tokyo and Kyoto, I'd already seen so many brightly lit shopping streets that this one didn't feel that special anymore. So I ended up just taking a few pics and leaving after 15 minutes. I think I would have regretted it if I'd gone to Osaka just for that.\n\nSpeaking of unpopular tourist opinions, I think you also shouldn't feel too sorry if for some reason your itinerary doesn't work out and you have to skip Himeji. The castle is large, very pretty and surrounded by a nice park, but it's nearly empty on the inside, so it just looks like a larger version of any other Japanese castle you might have on your agenda. On my trip, I had the same \"diminishing returns\" effect with Himeji as a did with Dotonbori and many other iconic spots - by the time I got there, I'd seen 2 other castles and they all started to look the same.\n\nI disagree with the person who told you to skip Hiroshima.

I didn't like the demigoddess origin theory, because it just felt wacky in all the wrong ways, and not well though-out at all. The early chapters where it came from introduced a bunch of gods with weird names and very little backstory and then threw the idea that Violet might be the child of a war goddess at the reader, then never mentioned it or anything about the world's religions ever again. It's hard to get any worse than this, so I prefer the theory from Benedict's chapter almost by default. And tbh, it's very close to the theory I came up with for my own mind canon after watching the anime. Violet getting drugged and brainwashed into a child soldier is just the obvious explanation for her fighting skills and amnesia at the beginning of the series, imo.\n\nHowever, I also disliked (again) how the theory was handled in this chapter after getting introduced. I'm a sucker for any little bit of worldbuilding information in this series, but both the LN and the anime are quite underdeveloped in this regard, so I'll take every little scrap. Akatsuki does this thing where she sometimes dangles intriguing bits of information in front of me, so I get hooked and keep reading and then she drops the whole topic and skips to something uninteresting again, such as lengthy action scenes. This chapter was a prime example. We get the information that there's another continent with an ethnic group where children are routinely drugged and trained to be mercenaries and then, plop. Dropped and never mentioned again. There are also hints that Violet might be Benedicts actual sister. Never mentioned again. It left me so unsatisfied.\n\nI also still didn't know what to make of Benedict after these chapters.

At least in the LN, the motivation of the villains made sense. And unlike in the anime, LN-Violet doesn't have an irrational aversion to killing people even in situations where people really, really urgently need to be killed and there's no alternative. So the absence of awkhard dialogue about the morality of killing and following orders that no-one in real life ever had or ever will have while being shot at by enemies on the roof of a runaway train hurtling towards a deadly chasm was a refreshing change of pace and made me feel well-disposed towards this chapter, with the exception of the romance parts.\n\n**2)** This chapter takes their relationship in a direction I found problematic because of the power dynamic between the two. When Violet gets reunited with Gil, she immediately regresses into begging him for orders and offering to be his tool. This felt like a step back for her. She was on her way to becoming an independant, socially competent young woman and the minute they meet, she behaves like a brainwashed child soldier again. It really made me question if it's healthy for her to have Gil in her life at all.\n\nSpeaking of Gil, this chapter also makes it very clear that the power gap between him and Violet is a lot larger than in the anime. The scene at the military headquarters shows that unlike anime-Gil, LN-Gil is someone who is really in his element in the army. He's had quite the successful military career since the end of the war, with two promotions. He's described as charismatic and self-assured several times. He's got his own elite fighting squad and the members all fanboi him. He's very deft at making the best out of his family's connections, reputation and money to advance his career. He always gets his way, any time we see him in a conflict, etc. Also, he's been watching her all this time, while she didn't even know he was still alive. All the power and control in their relationship is on his side.\n\nAll of this combined icks me out and LN-Gil also just felt like some very 2-dimensional white knight character to me after this chapter. There's nothing particularly interesting about him; he's just got too many skills and not enough flaws for my taste.", "created_utc": "1664120979.0", "edited": "1664121159.0", "id": "ipuoa5y", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_xgt9hl", "parent_id": "t3_xgt9hl", "score": "2", "subreddit": "VioletEvergarden", "subreddit_id": "t5_3fwmg"}, {"author": "DiverseUse", "body": "What do you actually use them for?

That way, you'll spend a minimum of time on public transport and more at your actual destinations. Also, 2 days in Rome isn't much and if you're with a tour group, you probably won't have much time to explore for yourself, so an extra day would come in handy. If you just want to spend some relax time by the beach, there's an urban rail line called the Roma-Lido line that takes you to Rome's seaside suburbs around Lido di Ostia in about 30-40 minutes from Rome's Porta S. Paolo / Ostiense station.\n\nBtw, Naples polarizes people. Everything you might have heard about it is true. It's sketchy, it's vibrant, it stinks, it's beautiful, it's confusing, it's got a shitload of interesting sights and the traffic is brutal. I can understand why some female solo travellers avoid it, but I liked it and would go again, so if you're actually interested in the area, don't let the prospect of having shady homeless guys look at you while scratching their crotches put you off.

With each passing week, the fetus develops more human features, so aborting it feels closer and closer to murder.\n\nYou can envision this point of view as a pair of scales, where the needs of the fetus and the needs of the mother are on the opposite points of the scale. \n\nLet's say you got a woman who's gotten pregnant from rape and wants to have an abortion, and then you got a person with view #3 morally evaluating her case. Let's call her Joan. At the beginning of the pregnancy, the scales are all tipped in favor of allowing the abortion, because as long as the embryo is just a lump of cells to Joan, she only sees the needs of the mother. The mother might get problems with her mental health if she's forced to carry her rapist's child, she might get permanent health problems from the pregnancy itself, she might be forced to quit her job and end up in financial trouble, etc. All these considerations lie on the pro-abortion scale while the anti-abortion scale is empty. So Joan feels that it would be unethical to deny this woman an abortion.\n\nTime passes. The fetus develops a rudimentary nervous system, so Joan now has to consider that the abortion might cause it pain. The ethical consideration \"It is wrong to cause pain to a living being\" is added to the anti-abortion scale, but it is not yet enough make the scale heavier than the mother's side. \n\nTime passes. The fetus starts to look more than a human being. The head starts to look more and more well-developed, so Joan starts to suspect that there's a brain in there that might have formed the first tendencies of a personality. With each passing week, more doubts gets added to the anti-abortion side of the scale, until it finally tips.\n\nBut if you were to ask Joan where exactly the tipping point is, she would be unable to say so. The reason is that no-one can grasp what exactly goes on in the mind of a fetus. Where is magic point where it turns into a human being?\n\nJoan can't pinpoint when exactly an abortion starts to bother her, so when you ask her, she tells you that abortions should be \"rare\". Making them rare minimises the number of cases where an abortion takes place after the point in time where Joan's personal comfort zone ends. \n\nI'd argue that this view is not morally inconsistent, merely ill explained.", "created_utc": "1656276122.0", "edited": "False", "id": "iduk5es", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_vl9fx0", "parent_id": "t3_vl9fx0", "score": "42", "subreddit": "ExplainBothSides", "subreddit_id": "t5_3jf35"}, {"author": "DiverseUse", "body": "Ja, wenn man in Richtung Wedel f\u00e4hrt, sollte man irgendwann unter dem Gewitter vorbei kommen.", "created_utc": "1656076554.0", "edited": "False", "id": "idjzdmc", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_vjlm7z", "parent_id": "t1_idjxp0a", "score": "5", "subreddit": "hamburg", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r4mj"}, {"author": "DiverseUse", "body": "YTB, possibly EBH\n\nDogs don't have some magical innate sense that makes them dislike only humans who have objectively done something wrong.

Auch Gran Canaria hat in der Hinsicht nicht so den gro\u00dfen Eindruck auf mich gemacht. Am sch\u00f6nsten fand ich noch Lanzarote - wir hatten das Gl\u00fcck, direkt nach einem der seltenen Regentage dort zu sein und dadurch ist dann sofort eine unglaubliche Artenvielfalt an Pflanzen erbl\u00fcht. Die Insel war dann gar nicht so r\u00f6tliche und karg, wie man sie aus Bildern kennt, sondern komplett gr\u00fcn.\n\nAls Gesamteindruck hab ich die Gegend so in die Kategorie \"ganz nett, aber\" eingespeichert. Es gibt nette Ecken und sch\u00f6ne Gelegenheiten zum Wandern gerade im Insel-Inneren, aber insgesamt ist es mir dort zu viel Massentourismus und der Flug ist mir zu lang daf\u00fcr, dass es quasi nicht \"besonders\" genug ist.", "created_utc": "1653917620.0", "edited": "False", "id": "iajjwnf", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_uyhr6b", "parent_id": "t3_uyhr6b", "score": "1", "subreddit": "reisende", "subreddit_id": "t5_4rdyqv"}, {"author": "DiverseUse", "body": "Another obvious difference used to be that the former Eastern parts had trams while the Western parts didn't, and also the Eastern parts kept their old symbols for pedestrian traffic lights.

If you only want to look up regional trains that will be covered by the 9 Euro ticket, check the option \"local transport only\" in their search function.\n\nIf you want to use long distance trains, the earlier you book, the cheaper it will be. Booking in advance can make a huge difference. E.g. saver prices for the train from Berlin to Hamburg start at 17.90 Euro, while a flexible ticket bought on the day you travel can be up to 70 Euro.\n\nDB's pricing system can be complicated for people who haven't grown up with it, so feel free to ask any questions.
