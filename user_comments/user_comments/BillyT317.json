As far as I know, the whole CEFR framework was initially designed as an international standard to measure language ability. Like, isn\u2019t it convenient for anyone to get a grasp of what\u2019s your level on a certain language using only 2 letters!? But really nothing more than that\u2026 at least I think so. Also, we shouldn\u2019t forget that the whole CEFR thing is REALLY helpful when it comes to teaching. It helps teachers and students to organise the teaching material, set deadlines and assess the students\u2019 progress. From my personal experience in CEFR examinations in both English and French, I know that these test are too standardised to even be compared with native speakers\u2019 level. There are English B2 or even C2 certificate holders in my country, who can\u2019t even watch a movie in English without subtitles in mother tongue. Also there are native speakers who can\u2019t even write their name. The whole comparison between the two is completely pointless. In my opinion, the biggest and final goal when learning a language is being fully functional when using it. I don\u2019t care if you can respond correctly to some multiple choice questions about an article having to do with animal biology in TL. Can you understand others when talking in everyday life? Can you make an order in a restaurant? Can you explain someone how you feel? Can you hold an everyday conversation? Can you send a formal email to your boss? Can you read a book or watch a movie or understand a song\u2019s lyrics? CAN YOU LIVE YOUR LIFE USING ONLY THIS LANGUAGE? THIS matters most to me. And native speakers usually ace at it. Language learners can also ace at it, but it doesn\u2019t really have to do with some standardised test score\u2026 or at least that\u2019s what I think.

You\u2019ll be ALWAYS coming across new words and expressions. Also, the native speakers\u2019 level in their mother tongue varies across people and *especially* across different languages.

What I mean is that we all have to acquaint ourselves with the fact that no one knows any language perfectly. Maybe near perfectly but not perfectly.  When learning a foreign language, I think that we should initially focus on being functional, being able to express ourselves and understand others.
