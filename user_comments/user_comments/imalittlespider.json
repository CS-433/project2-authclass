When I first heard the song, I was quite disappointed with the chorus.\n\nI personally preferred the NF performance because I don't like the \"nooo\" before the the mask gets taken off since I feel it takes away from the moment. I also don't like the tall stairs because it takes away from bridge. I prefer the white gown though. He messed up in the GF a bit, which I didn't think helped.\n\nTo improve the song, I would've made the second chorus only 2 \"I'm Not the Same\"'s so it is less repetitive.

What Montaigne said: They hired a private risk assessor and they (the risk assessor) ultimately deemed that there was no way that made sense for them to go cuz europe got corona and quarantine\n\nWhat the delegation said: Well look there were lot of reasons...\n\n*kinda sus, hey*\n\nSidenote: Now, if we look at the start of this, Montaigne said she got told there was a 99% chance she would go to Rotterdam. I think SBS didn't put full effort into the live on tape because of this. They were simply too positive. Tbh I thought they wouldn't go to Rotterdam from the start, cuz of corona.\n\nNow, about the odds. Someone else mention Montaigne's tweet, so I don';t need talk in depth about the tweet. But even before that, Montaigne was prob looking at the odds cuz I remember looking at one of her interviews last year and how her friends and fam were/are esc fans. She even said earlier she saw all the nq comments.\n\nOff that got a bit off topic but (tl;dr) I think it would've impacted the decision but it wasn't the main reason\n\nEdit: Look what I found from a dude from the delegation: \"\\[Technicolour\\] will just be too different for some countries,\" Paul Clarke, the executive producer and creative director of Eurovision \u2014 Australia Decides says. \"But you never know.
