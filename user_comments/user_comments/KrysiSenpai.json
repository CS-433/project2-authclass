But I think there's one thing you have to be prepared to face: organisation. Polish universities tend to be an unorganised nightmare. They might be good itself, but prepare for even uni lecturers not having a clue the fucks going on sometimes. Although maybe it's different on the one you want to attend, but still, I think that's the one thing you'll surely notice very soon. \n\nSomeone shared their opinion about working in Poland as well, as in, that you'll basically be used as a low-wage slave. While some of that is true, I think it's only half the truth. It depends on the company, but if you want to have a good job, stick far from small, polish companies, those tend to be the most problematic. If you have some job experience, I think multinational corporations are a safe bet. I know, there's a lot of bad aura around them, but there's a lot of corpos that are actually pretty good and pay really well. It really depends on the company you'll get hired to, but speaking for myself, if you have any useful skill that can probably be one of the best places to work in. I'm really happy myself, I work for a German company and its honestly great, and they also pay very well.\n\nAnyway, I think overall Poland isn't like the worst place to settle in.
