All my best Jobs have been just as you described. Conversational interviews discussing past situations with like minded and experienced people. None of the bullshit exam questions nobody gives a shit about or the random fact about a primary service that never breaks or if it does is literally the easiest Google ever. People should be able to talk about how they made an impact, how they saved money, how they fixed a shitty situation. \n\nSame goes as a candidate. If you are only getting shitty technical questions your interviewer: A) looked up your questions to ask you 15 minutes on the internet before walking in the room with you, or B) suck at their job and have zero experience hiring, or C) likely both A and B. You need to flip the interview to conversational by asking relevant questions to the host showing your interest in THEM. People love talking about themselves and this will almost always get you on their good side and before you know it time is up for them. This will always leave them with a good  impression of you because you were relatable for THEM. However if you have to do this you need to question yourself if it's the kind of environment you want to work in anyways. If these people suck at screening for quality people, then the rest of the team will almost always be hit or miss, which will be interesting once you are onboarded. Usually have some great engineers but majority of the team will be dead weight or have inflated titles. You typically aren't learning in these environments, rather mentoring the Super Senior Uber Cloud Engineering Architect Head of Department greenies.\n\nP.S. I just had a panel interview and after passing phone screen with CISO spoke with a bunch of security and IT engineers. 4/5 of the panel we're aligned with the CISO vision, which is why I was called in, but one dude was just annoying and counter intuitive asking me questions about a service the CISO wants gone. I literally had to put the interviewer on blast during the interview and ask why I'm being asked irrelevant questions to the current situation about something everyone is pushing out the door. The host was shocked, but I still got an offer. Sometimes you have to show you know when and how to speak up in a situation tipped against you. It can demonstrate seniority and experience not always doing what's told, but asking the important questions of relevance and scope when necessary.
