But, despite that my situation is so different, I think I do have a little bit to offer you.\n\nRemember first that all anyone you meet will want to do is communicate.  Unless you happen to run into someone who is learning English and really wants to practice, people will switch to whatever language is easiest.  This means that many French speakers will insist on speaking to you in English because it's just less work, even if your French is at an honest B1 level, if you have a strong accent or find yourself stuck thinking of the right word.  You may have to ask explicitly to stay in French.\n\nSecond, whether you, as a tourist, will have much opportunity to socialize with locals depends a lot on the specific nature of your trip, how you choose to spend your time, and where you go.  If you're attending a convention or gathering that's held predominantly in French for people with a common interest, that might be a great opportunity.  If you're sightseeing and stay on the main tourist paths, you'll probably mostly interact with locals in shops and restaurants.\n\nJust remember that as an intermediate language learner, you're asking your speaking partners to take on a certain level of work to speak with you, particularly if they are better in English than you are in French (which will be common.)\n\nFinally, the culture of the community you're visitng matters.  Icelanders are not very talkative, which means random conversations with them will be hard to come by if you visit.  I really have no idea how outgoing the Quebecois are, in general.  But, that factor could work for you or against you.\n\nIf you really want to have meaningful conversations with locals, before you go:  Get a lot of practice speaking freely on all kinds of topics.  I can't tell you how many times I have attempted to speak Icelandic and found myself freezing up, despite understanding their side of the conversation well enough and knowing vocabulary that should add up to me being able to say something reasonable in response.  Practicing will help with this a LOT.\n\nAnyway, have fun!  Travel can be a lot of fun even if it's an uneven language experience.

Neither his methodology nor his YouTube content is particularly language-specific.  The graded readers and language courses are language-specific, but Richards does not, himself, develop them.  (They are created by experts in each target language.)  He doesn't even argue that his particular method is wildly better than other language learning methods; instead he presents it as a way to solve a particular problem, which is providing a motivated learner a hook to become and stay engaged in the process for the thousands of hours needed to become skilled in a language.\n\nIt's important, too, to keep in mind that the methodology he does advocate, which is based on [Stephen Krashen's Comprehensible Input Hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Input_hypothesis), also doesn't depend on a lot of explicit training to learn the details you're pointing out about Japanese in your response.\n\nSo, in a video like this, which is meant to get people who are thinking about learning Japanese interested in its details, overgeneralizations or approximate statements that aren't the full story (such as that Japanese vowel sounds tend to behave regularly and that there are few totally new consonant sounds) really aren't pedagogically relevant.\n\nAlso, he may not have emphasized it in this video, but Richards is up-front in general that he's not particularly proficient at Japanese, and that it's only a language he's started to study over the last couple of years.  The Japanese books and courses with his name on them were developed with his consultation as to method and teaching approach, but he didn't originate the content himself.  Furthermore, he doesn't promote his language course content as being a complete solution to learning a language.  They are instead meant to help beginners get to a point where they can start consuming simplified content in the target language and learn in a self-directed way.\n\nI have not personally looked at Richards' online Japanese course, but I have purchased the Icelandic A2-B1 graded reader from his book series.  It's a high-quality product despite that Richards doesn't anywhere claim to have ever tried to learn any Icelandic.  I wouldn't dismiss the Japanese course without looking at the course itself.  (Calling a course \"unnecessary\" is a weird choice of words, btw.  No particular source of information about a language is \"necessary,\" but it might well be useful.)\n\nFinally, as to his presentation style and personality, he's popular on YouTube because some people find him very enjoyable to watch, but he also really rubs some people the wrong way.

My decision to pursue permanent residence and citizenship came later.)\n\nAs /u/magmoug points out, the two most common routes are to marry an Icelander or to get a residence and work permit for a specialized job.  Usually, such jobs must require a four-year college degree and be in a field that is difficult to hire in the EU/EEA, but if you have exceptional skills in a needed specialized job and a ton of work experience you might be able to get sponsored without a four-year degree.\n\nUnder current law, it\u2019s possible to come to Iceland on a student permit and either marry a local or get a specialist job later.  If you do this, some of your time on the student permit can count toward qualifying for a permanent residence permit or citizenship.\n\nWith all these methods, if you get divorced (if on a marriage permit), lose your job (if for work), or drop out of school (as a student,) you will have to leave promptly.\n\nInitially you are issued a temporary residence permit that must be renewed every year or two.  After a number of years, you may apply for a permanent residence permit.\n\nIf you are the spouse of an Icelander, you can get the permanent residence permit at three years and apply for citizenship at four. Otherwise, permanent residence comes at four years and citizenship at seven.  Permanent residence requires proof of language training or passing a test in Icelandic, while citizenship requires passing a test (with some uncommon exceptions.)\n\nYou also will need to prove that you have not taken welfare payments for the indigent as well as that your taxes are paid up and that you have a clean criminal record (including speeding tickets!)\n\nFinally, the wait for your application to be processed can take another nine to 18 months, during which you must continue to reside in Iceland. (You can travel overseas no more than 90 days out of each year.)\n\nAnyway, I moved to Iceland in September, 2014, and my daughter (who was born here) and I were granted citizenship in June of this year.  Two weeks later, my son was born, and he acquired citizenship at birth.

Getting into VFX initially will be a struggle in any case, and there are lots of ways to learn the necessary skills.\n\nThe reason to get a more general education is that VFX may not always be a viable or desirable profession for you. Many of the people I have worked with over the years in animation and VFX production have gone on to do other things when the relentless deadlines and pressure to relocate internationally pushed them over the edge.  It\u2019s an industry that grinds people up and spits them out, and you will have plenty of time to subject yourself to that after college.\n\nBtw, the way you\u2019re presenting this, it sounds like they\u2019re helping pay for this.

Here's my feeling on this:\n\nWorking as an artist or TD in VFX is a job that will chew you up and spit you out.  Your technical competence will be a huge plus, but you'll be underutilizing it and end up working 80 hour weeks, probably in a foreign country, maybe without full overtime pay, and bottom line is, you'll be turning the crank to work on movies that aren't even consistently valuable cultural contributions.  (I believe in and love the art of film, but the bulk of visual effects work is done for films that are forgotten days after they're released.)\n\nFocusing on a research and development software engineering career, even for a VFX or animation company, can offer a career path that's a lot more stable.  Companies are a lot less ready to cyclically fire such employees because they're so hard to find and onboard.  Plus, the work is a lot more intellectually challenging and engaging, and you'll always be regarded as one of the smartest people in the room.  Finally, and this is important, **software engineers in the industry mostly tend to work a 40-hour work week.**\n\nWhen I took a software engineer role at Disney Feature Animation in 1996, at age 25, I was completely convinced that I and my peers were second-class citizens, barely tolerated in a world ruled by artists and producers.  In fact, looking back today, many more of my peers in the technology development area are still with Disney, and have been working there continuously, than people I knew in artistic and production roles.\n\nIt took me years of spinning my wheels, taking on projects that didn't really help my career, begging for opportunities, and changing jobs to wind up working as a digital lighting artist.  Then, once I got into it, I realized that while my technical skills were maybe 80th percentile, my artistic skills (generously) were in the bottom half.  I still lucked into some very good opportunities and had a relatively stable career, but for almost every job, I was selected despite, not because of, my artistic output, because I brought more to the table technically.\n\nMoving back into software development was by far the best career move I've made.

The main reason I'd want a telephoto would be for puffins, but late October isn't the right time for them anyway.)\n\nOne thing to consider is that, in late October, you probably will not be in the mood to swap lenses much when you are sightseeing outdoors. Weather will be cold, often rainy, and probably quite windy too.  (Of course, you can always hop in your car if you are renting one.)\n\nI shoot Nikon, so it's not exactly the same, but I have a lens that's about in the equivalent range of your 18-55mm and I very rarely take it off when shooting outdoors here, both because conditions are hostile to lens swaps and because the range is extremely good for landscapes.  The prime comes out for low-light or indoor shots.\n\nAnother thing worth considering:  Any kind of tripod or monopod, even the portable type a few inches high that you can rest on another stable object, can greatly improve your photos.  You can't always use a tripod in places like museums, and you'll want something light that you can carry around everywhere, but I strongly recommend considering compact options for your trip.

The more Icelandic one learns, the better. It\u2019s just that one can immigrate and get by just fine without mastering it immediately. \n\nBut, here are some basic facts about immigrating to Iceland that may not be obvious to you if you\u2019re an Icelander.  I say this having lived in Iceland eight years.  I\u2019m an Icelandic citizen and so are my two young children, who were born here.\n\n1) You will never really fit in, and you shouldn\u2019t make the mistake that learning Icelandic will fix that.\n\nIcelanders are highly sensitive to one\u2019s personal and family history. I know a couple of immigrants who have been here decades, married into Icelandic families, become fluent with the language, had kids and grandkids here, and nevertheless their *kids* often get referred to as foreigners with citizenship.\n\n2) Speaking the language will not make it much easier to make Icelandic friends.\n\nIcelanders tend to draw a line that places family and friends from preschool on one side and everyone else on the other.  It takes years of history with a person to become a real friend, setting language completely aside.\n\nDon\u2019t misunderstand me on this: Icelanders can be some of the warmest, most generous and helpful and kind people you\u2019ll ever meet.  But, most of them aren\u2019t accepting applications for new friendships at this time. The people you will encounter who need and want new friends are fellow immigrants, and this presents the issue that you end up feeding a stereotype that foreigners only talk to each other and don\u2019t \u201cintegrate,\u201d etc.  But, foreigners are mostly the ones who will accept your party invitations.\n\nI have a few really good Icelandic friends, and they\u2019d help bury the body in my car\u2019s trunk if necessary. But, their friendship was hard-won, and even immigrants who speak Icelandic perfectly tell the same story.\n\n3) It\u2019s incredibly difficult to learn Icelandic, and not for the reasons you think.\n\nPeople complain about the language being difficult, and it is, but that\u2019s not the problem. The problem is that Icelanders instantly switch to English when they realize you are not very good at the language.  This means that it\u2019s hard to get good speaking practice.  Now, I have noticed people getting better about this in the past several years. There has been some publicity about this problem. But, it\u2019s still an issue.\n\n4) English-language workplaces (officially or not) are more common than elsewhere in Europe, and not just in tourism.\n\nA few larger Icelandic companies that rely on foreign labor have standardized on English as the primary language in the workplace.  I work at one of these, and they\u2019re serious enough about it that even when it\u2019s just Icelanders in a meeting, they often speak English together. That\u2019s been a great experience for helping keep my life as an immigrant stable and productive, but working there has done absolutely nothing to help with my language skills.\n\n5) You won\u2019t want to try to deal with medical doctors in Icelandic until you are completely comfortable doing so.  (And yeah, they\u2019re more likely to complain about speaking English than just about anyone else.)\n\nMiscommunication can cost lives, and English is the international language of medicine. Most doctors have studied overseas, in English.  It\u2019s not worth poisoning yourself because you\u2019ve misunderstood instructions on how to take your prescription, or being diagnosed incorrectly because you used the wrong word for a symptom.\n\nBottom line: Don\u2019t let anyone else tell you how important learning the language should be for you.  It\u2019s worth investing all the time you can tolerate spending into it. It\u2019s worth achieving excellent listening skills and conversational fluency. It\u2019s worth being able to read and write at an academic level.

These purchases may incur international transaction fees and be currency converted but they will not be cash advances.\n\nThe one situation where having a chip-and-signature card may be annoying is when using automated kiosks for parking, buying fuel, or at vending machines.

They have multiple locations downtown and elsewhere. (If you're downtown, their L\u00e6kjargata location will be a quick walk away.)\n\n[Kaffi Laugal\u00e6kur](https://www.laekur.is/kaffimatbar) is a nice little cafe with excellent food and a vegan menu with good choices.  It's located at the L\u00e6kur Hostel and is some distance east of downtown.\n\nMore typical is [The Laundromat Caf\u00e9](http://www.thelaundromatcafe.is/), which has fewer vegetarian and vegan options, but enough to have some things to choose from. (Their English menu is available [here.](https://irp.cdn-website.com/6cf9c5fd/files/uploaded/Laundromat%20%20ensku.pdf))\n\nIf you like falafel, [Mandi](https://mandi.is/menu-2/) is a good choice, and they also have multiple locations around.  They also make fantastic hummus in a few different varieties.\n\nThere are a lot more options out there and I think you should have little trouble finding appealing vegetarian choices wherever you go.\n\nYou should know, though that [\"veganesti\" cookies **are not vegan.**](https://grapevine.is/news/2019/06/25/sorry-folks-veganesti-is-not-a-vegan-cookie/)\n\nEdit: From that last article is a link to [this Swedish-language blog](http://www.islandsbloggen.com/2019/05/att-vara-vegetarian-och-vegan-pa-island.html) listing a HUGE list of restaurants in Reykjav\u00edk and elsewhere with vegan options.

This all looks great.  A few thoughts:\n\nIf you want to have a hot dog while you're here, instead of having one in Selfoss, I'd recommend getting one during your Reykjav\u00edk visit at the [B\u00e6jarins Beztu Pylsur](https://bbp.is/) wagon on Tryggvagata.  This is the iconic, original hot dog stand that started the trend.\n\nIf your plan to have hot dogs in Selfoss is not explicitly intended to avoid eating at a restaurant, I recommend taking a look instead at [Kaffi Kr\u00fas](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g315852-d3434867-Reviews-Kaffi_Krus-Selfoss_South_Region.html).  It's a favorite of our family and their food has always been quite good.\n\nThe hot springs at Gunnuhver might be closed due to the ongoing volcanic activity on the Reykjanes peninsula.  It's also possible that access to the area might be an issue depending on where the lava winds up.  If you're up for a serious hike and have good hiking boots and appropriate clothing, you might attempt to visit the volcano itself.  (The eruption is about 7 km from the nearest parking and a 300m rise, so if you're uncertain about the hike, it may be best to see if sticking to your plan can work.)\n\nSome ideas about things to do in Reykjav\u00edk:  The [National Museum of Iceland (\u00dej\u00f3\u00f0minjasafn \u00cdslands)](https://www.thjodminjasafn.is/english/) has a great collection and lots of interesting information about Iceland's history.  It's centrally located and parking in the museum lot is free for visitors.  (There is an admission fee of 2500kr per adult.)\n\n[Perlan,](https://www.perlan.is/en-gb) a prominent building high on a hill in central Reykjav\u00edk, is a natural history museum with an artificial ice cave, a regular planetarium show and a huge, beautiful, 360 degree observation deck included in the admission price.  It used to be a water storage facility for the city.  (Perlan has an admission fee of 4690kr per adult.)\n\nThe Old Harbor area and neighboring Grandi neighborhood are home to the Maritime Museum and lots of opportunities to watch ships and boats move around.  A restaurant nearby that we love is [The Coocoo's Nest](https://www.coocoosnest.is/), on Grandargar\u00f0ur.  (The proprietor is an American from Ukiah, California, and they have a really great brunch on weekends.)\n\nOf course, [Hallgr\u00edmskirjka](https://www.hallgrimskirkja.is/en/visiting-the-church) (the impossible-to-miss church in the center of downtown) is worth visiting.  It also has an observation deck that you can visit for a 1200kr per adult fee.\n\nFinally, since you are making such an effort to be careful about Icelandic spelling, here are a few place names that are spelled a bit differently than in your post:\n\n* Reykjav\u00edk\n* Keflav\u00edk\n* Hverager\u00f0i\n* Reykjanesb\u00e6r\n\n(I wouldn't bring this up except that you put such care into spelling your place names correctly, which is awesome!)", "created_utc": "1660522319.0", "edited": "1660522523.0", "id": "ikbjay6", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_woh1pa", "parent_id": "t3_woh1pa", "score": "4", "subreddit": "VisitingIceland", "subreddit_id": "t5_2wgkr"}, {"author": "Lysenko", "body": "Almost anywhere that takes credit cards can take common NFT payment systems including Apple Pay.

A relative of mine, from the U.S., had her Capital One credit card frozen for weeks because we set up Apple Pay for her and she attempted to make a payment.

That should give you a sign of where the business\u2019s priorities are.\n\n* Software work is clear-cut.  You have well-defined goals and know when you\u2019re done.  Often, in VFX, how much to iterate is subjective, and the problem of how hard to work lands on the shoulders of you, the artist.

I edited my comment to make clear that that\u2019s a possibility.\n\nHowever, the opinion in the Chess24 case you referenced did not decide that question.  They did decide that chess moves in a tournament were uncopyrightable matters of fact, but they used a precedent that involved reporting on newsworthy results of NBA games, which isn\u2019t in any way applicable to the chess puzzle case, and the purpose and process of creation of chess puzzles make them not necessarily analogous to moves in a tournament game. In a chess puzzle published in a book, one is using a common medium (the game of chess) to express an idea (a tactical principle) using a board position that is often formed from nothing for that purpose.  (Silman\u2019s books are a little different in this regard in that he often draws on positions from his students\u2019 games.  Presumably these would be more susceptible to the argument in the NBA case.)\n\nThere\u2019s an article from a while back in the Duke Law and Technology Review that discusses these matters in relation to sudoku puzzles, which are very similar.  I\u2019m unable to find the article online though, so I can\u2019t offer you a link.  Their short answer was that it is unclear, and depends on a lot of specifics that would come up in litigation.  My understanding is that they focused a lot on exactly how the puzzles are created, and distinguished hand-made puzzles from those that were created at random by a computer.\n\nAlso, of course, a district court summary judgment ruling is probably the weakest possible precedent on which to base a legal argument, but it sure is better than nothing.\n\nWhether it would matter to a court that there\u2019s been a long-standing understanding in the chess publishing community that chess positions are always uncopyrightable as pure ideas, that I have no idea.  But, I do think it\u2019s worth noting that the court in the Chess24 case did not even consider that question in their opinion.\n\nIt\u2019s also worth taking into consideration that publicly saying \u201cI\u2019m taking these puzzles from Jeremy Silman\u2019s book\u201d might invite litigation even if the law is against the plaintiffs when push comes to shove.\n\nAlso, simply asking for permission might just be all it takes here.  It\u2019s very possible that the publisher might have no problem with it.\n\nEdit:  Another wrinkle is the statute and case law that makes it possible to copyright collections of uncopyrightable facts.

Remember also that Twitch being in the US means you may have to worry about US law as well for your purposes.)\n\nUsing puzzles from the book would possibly be a copyright infringement, but US law establishes that certain infringements are fair use.  Uses that focus on commentary, research, and scholarship can be permitted infringements.\n\n(\u201cPossibly\u201d because many argue that chess positions are uncopyrightable as a matter of law as pure ideas, rather than the expression of an idea.  There\u2019s some discussion about this later in the thread.)\n\nFactors that affect whether what you do is considered fair use include:\n\n1) Whether the study or commentary is nonprofit or for-profit. (Are you making money from streaming, or trying to?)\n\n2) The nature of the copyrighted work (for example, how much original effort and creativity went into creating these puzzles, since the underlying ideas and concepts cannot be copyrighted and the rules of chess may limit how such puzzles are constructed.)\n\n3) What proportion of the book you intend to cover.  (One puzzle is likely to be less a problem than covering a whole chapter, and that\u2019s likely to be less a problem than a series that goes through the entire contents of the book.)\n\n4) What impact is there on the market for the copyrighted work?

Here are the tips I'm following, and they're helping:\n\n1) Try playing slow games.  30 minute games will give you a lot more time than 15|10 or 10 minute formats to consider whether you are hanging a piece.\n\n2) Always look for, in this order, checks, captures, and threats when you're looking for prospective moves, on the ENTIRE board.  Don't just play them.  Ask yourself whether they leave you better off than you were.\n\n3) When you have a move you like, look at what your opponent will see after you move, including checks, captures, and threats.  Those are the moves they'll use to force you to do things you don't want to do, or punish a mistake.\n\n4) Remember that having tunnel vision about the move they just made might distract you from a more important thing happening elsewhere.\n\n5) Remember that bishops, rooks, and queens can have critical effects from all the way across the board.  You need to know where they are and see what they threaten.\n\n6)  Do puzzles to improve your tactics.  If you have a platinum or better membership, you can do all the puzzles you like on chess.com, and the Custom mode lets you pick specific themes to practice.  Lichess has free puzzles.  Also, Chessable has the excellent book 1001 Chess Exercises for Beginners which is a great way to do structured practice of specific tactical ideas.

Here are some good ideas of when NOT to do it:\n\n*  If you're behind on material.  (Exchanging pieces will make you proportionally more behind.)\n\n*  Often, if you're losing a bishop to capture a knight.  (Bishops are often held to be slightly more useful than knights, although that's situational and this consideration might go the other way in some circumstances.)\n\n*  If the exchange leaves a piece hanging (unprotected by any of your other pieces).\n\n*  Often, if the exchange causes you to double, or worse, triple, pawns in a rank.  (These are positional considerations that might be less of a concern than some other advantage you might gain.)\n\n*  If exchanging pieces yields a loss of tempo (For example, if the exchange requires you to move a piece you've already developed to a good spot, and their side gets to develop a piece that's still in its starting location, they've gained an extra developing move, which is called a \"tempo\" advantage.)\n\n*  If exchanging the pieces undoes some of your development without making them do the same.  (Typically, this means you're moving advanced pieces backwards to capture.)\n\nOf course, if leaving their piece on the board sets up a tactical situation like a fork/pin/skewer on the next move for them, or if it is directly threatening one of your pieces, or if the piece is positioned to obstruct some other objective of yours, then it makes sense to ignore all those reasons and take the trade.\n\nWhat John Bartholomew says is:  \"If you can't describe a reason why making the trade helps you, you should not take the trade.\"\n\nHere's a great John Bartholomew video that talks about the entire question.

However, I have some guesses.  (Edit:  I should clarify that I'm not particularly defending their choice vs. other alternatives, just offering thoughts about what they're likely thinking with this.  These kinds of design choices are really subjective and I don't claim to have a better idea than anyone else about what the best balance is.):\n\nThey're probably looking at the NPE as primarily aimed at players starting from zero with MTG knowledge.  They're trying to hit what they're hoping is a big, untapped market of people who have never played Magic before.\n\nAfter finishing the tutorial, a player walks away with all the one-color starter decks, which are relatively low power, but at that point someone new to the game needs to be introduced to two-color decks.  So, at that point they start handing out two-color decks as quest rewards.  Here are some of the goals they're probably worried about with this:\n\n* They want a player to be exposed to slightly higher power-level decks that give them a foundation to build on.\n\n* They want a new player to have credible options for doing all the daily quests with these higher-quality decks:  \"Play 40 red or blue cards\" for example.\n\n* They don't want to overwhelm a new player with options.  Giving them a total of fifteen decks in the first two weeks (five one-color and ten two-color) may be amazing for a player who knows Magic and is already hoping for certain color combinations to build on, but likely starts to be overwhelming for a new player.   Playing a different deck requires figuring out win conditions and synergies and how to get the most from the deck's theme, and with so many decks to choose from, it has the potential to be an awful lot to take in.\n\n* They also likely want to avoid a situation where everyone has the same five two-color decks, which would mean those are the only decks you ever see on ladder.  By having four tracks with modest overlap, they can ensure new players are seeded with decks they can reasonably take the time to play and experiment with, yet will have a far more varied experience once they queue up.\n\n* Not allowing players to choose the track is important, because otherwise it's likely that players would fixate on minor quality differences between tracks and you'd get all new players looking up the \"best\" track on the Internet, thus undermining the variety from the last point.\n\nI personally do NOT think that the volume of free cards in the decks was much of a factor in their decision, since the quality level of cards in these sets is low on average and it's a one-time giveaway to get new players started.

You are unlikely to learn much that's useful and the cost can be very high.  There is no reason that you can't use the skills you developed in your architecture degree to create a demo reel that will earn you work.  I've worked with a number of former architects who have gone that route.\n\nIf you have the artistic skills for matte painting, it's a more rarefied specialty than compositing.  Today's matte painters mostly build paintings from photographic source material and handle the entire end-to-end process of projecting those paintings onto 3D geometry, then rendering elements for compositing with what's photographed.  A few years ago, Cinema 4D was very popular for this task.  I'm not sure if it's been supplanted by something else since then -- my career path has carried me away from the VFX matte painting world.\n\nMy advice would be to get some cheap personal-use licenses for packages like Maya that support such licensing, then work on a matte painting reel that 3D tracks a set extension into a scene, with a photorealistic matte painting projected onto it.  To get a first job in the field, your best bet is to focus all your attention on one professional-quality shot of moderate difficulty.  You don't need an entire short film, and a lot of students fall into the trap of showing way too much mediocre work instead of refining and perfecting a top-quality showpiece that truly demonstrates the upper limit of their skills.\n\nIf you do put something together, feel free to PM me on here and I'm happy to take a look at a rough cut to give you feedback.  I've worked in VFX and animation at Disney, Dreamworks, Pacific Data Images, and Rhythm and Hues Studios over a 22-year period, and worked on two productions at Rhythm as a matte painting TD (developing tools to support matte painters and helping set up projections), so I can be pretty specific about what marks you're trying to hit with your reel.\n\nFinally, and this may be a reason to be cautious, be ready to move anywhere in the world.  VFX production is chasing tax breaks right now and much of it has been moving around between Canada, the UK, Australia/NZ, and places like Singapore.\n\nEdit:  I can certainly see why people warn you not to do it!  And, I made a conscious decision to get out into a different, related field.  But, if it's appealing to you, I think there's no reason not to do it for a while and see how it goes.

I don't mean this to take you down a notch, but instead to offer specific feedback that might help what you choose to do next time.\n\nFirst, who looks at that piece has no sense for what it should look like, and so it's impossible to tell how much work went into what you did or what you achieved.  And no, adding more description in a written reel breakdown is not a way to solve this problem.\n\nSecond, your lighting is in an extremely unfortunate place that actively sabotages your work.  You have rendered this particle system to look uniformly dark, and placed it on top of a dark background so that you can't see it.  If your goal is simulating something (in this instance, water?  judging by the name of the piece) you shouldn't be trying to light it at all, just make the particles neon colors so people can see and evaluate your simulation.  Yes, lighting such a thing is an important skill, but it looks like you need a lot of practice on that area separately.\n\nFinally:  The title calls this a \"water creature,\" but there's nothing watery about it.  It's a cloud of particles, which is an easy thing to make, but it simply doesn't look like water, splashing or otherwise.\n\n[Here's what real splashing water looks like.](https://i.imgur.com/3Sp9iYM.jpg)  There is a surface defined by the surface tension of some of the water, with droplets flying around here and there.  The water's brightness comes largely from reflecting the sky, and that's added on to the refracted light from what's on the other side.  Depending on the scene, one or the other of these may be a lot more prominent, but in your scene it just looks like a dark cloud.\n\n[Here's what professional-quality computer animated water looked like 15 years ago.](https://youtu.be/gQ2DAA-i8l0?t=1m39s)\n\n[Here's what it looked like five years ago.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFv7R28oTAM)  (And yeah certain bits of that sequence don't look great -- my team did the work, and we were doing so while our company, Rhythm & Hues, was literally filing for bankruptcy in the middle of our production schedule.)\n\nI almost feel like a good move would be to take a painting class.

The idea is that you put together a large enough collection of cards (a \u201ccube\u201d) and use one of a number of techniques for splitting those cards up among the players.  One simple technique is to put together fully-randomized collections of 180 non-basic-land cards per player, and each player builds a 40-card deck with anything they can find in those 180 cards, plus as many basic lands as they want.  A typical deck might be 14 basic lands and 26 other cards.\n\nThis splits up the really strong synergies that may be enabling that one deck and challenges players to build something new each time that plays to interesting strengths in their pile of cards.  Then, you play a few-round tournament to see who wins.  When you\u2019re done, all the cards go back in the cube and get shuffled together for next time, when you\u2019ll split it up into new sets of 180 per person.\n\nThis type of approach works really well if you have a sizable collection of random cards from one or a couple blocks, since the blocks are designed (in part) to be interesting to play in random draft formats.  The power level will be lower of course, and there won\u2019t be the same feeling of long-term tweaking and refinement, but it will get everyone more focused on what is a good card and how to do something new and strong based on what one\u2019s draft looks like.\n\n(And, of course, if you have one stand-out mythic rare bomb card that is so strong that it always seems to be on the winning side, you can exclude it from your cube.)", "created_utc": "1525818985.0", "edited": "False", "id": "dyo1ran", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_8hzrl0", "parent_id": "t3_8hzrl0", "score": "3", "subreddit": "CasualMTG", "subreddit_id": "t5_2uo3g"}, {"author": "Lysenko", "body": "Oh regarding booster packs, many game stores will happily sell you piles of random common cards for really cheap.

Here's a picture of how this kind of thing might work.\n\nThe game designers have a big list of ideas that they would like to put into the game.  Initially they don't necessarily filter these for technical feasibility.  Instead, they print out cards with a printer and try them on paper.  (The Hearthstone team has in the past indicated that this is one way that they first try out new mechanics.)\n\nAs they try ideas, they'll shuffle their list of priorities around.  Whatever is most fun or interesting and doesn't get ruled out for breaking the game bubbles to the top.  At a certain point, they'll decide to run their top few ideas past the rest of the team.  (Maybe the rest of the team has already been playtesting these ideas on paper and thinking about them, or maybe they do this as part of this stage of the process.)\n\nOne or more game designers will sit down with a UI developer and brainstorm some ideas about how the mechanic will function.  The UI developer will provide feedback about options.  Like /u/Soup_Roll says, it is more complicated to provide a means to select a card in the hand than it is to pick a random card, but at this point both options will be on the table.\n\nThe UI developer (or a lead, or the whole UI team) will then look at the development roadmap to see what other tasks are coming up and make some wild guess estimates of how long different options might take and where they will fit.  They may go back to game design and say \"You can have a random card buff with some kind of shiny feedback saying to the other player which card is buffed this week, but picking a card out of your hand will be more complicated and we will probably not be able to finish that before February with the work we've already committed, although you can have it in two weeks if you are willing to push back the work for the multi-class cards. [jade etc.]\"\n\nAt this point, game design has to make some choices. February might be too late for the work to make it into the next expansion.  They could push back the multi-class cards but they're the centerpiece of the expansion's story, and the voice actors have already started recording, plus they want this card buffing mechanic to be one of the multi-class abilities.  They don't really have any ideas they're ready to commit to that are simpler from a UI standpoint, and their playtests have suggested that the random card buff feels pretty powerful as a mechanic anyway.\n\nSo, they elect to go for the simpler random mechanic.  UI gets to work, delivers in two weeks, and the expansion releases on time.\n\nBottom line is that this kind of development is a balancing act.  With the team they have, which for a successful game is ALWAYS too small, how much value can they bring to the game within the constraints of their release dates?\n\nIn our hypothetical scenario, perhaps a couple of UI programmers run into each other at the expansion release party.  One of them has been thinking about the conversation about that feature, and brings up that there would be value in general in having a way to select a card in the hand.  So, perhaps they bring back to their team an idea to build a little infrastructure to make that problem easier to solve next time.\n\nTwo expansions later, the same question comes up, but this time it's easy to do and makes it into the game.", "created_utc": "1486778369.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ddlklf2", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_5t6r2m", "parent_id": "t3_5t6r2m", "score": "1", "subreddit": "hearthstone", "subreddit_id": "t5_2w31t"}, {"author": "Lysenko", "body": "The client prevents you from running an alpha and an omega, or two alphas, at the same time.

To me, it reminds me a lot of [Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfenstein:_Enemy_Territory)\n\nEach of these games let you choose a character (or character class) that has very strong differences from the other choices in relation to their strengths and weaknesses.  A character with high damage may have poor mobility.  A character with high mobility may require much greater effort to aim correctly.  A character may be strong at healing other players on the team and weak at doing damage for themselves.\n\nTo play, you form teams of these characters with other people.  Now, the most fun I've had in these games are playing with groups of friends who develop niches that work well together.  Maybe I specialize in playing healers and my friend specializes in playing high speed, high-damage characters.  As we play, we learn ways of working together, both generally and on specific maps, to achieve strong synergies.\n\nOverwatch can be very fun on a completely random team if everyone knows the game, has an idea of what each character's strength is, and picks a halfway reasonable team comp.  When playing with five other friends, though, there's another level there of planned cooperation.  \"OK, if I pick Zarya for her black hole ability (which sucks up enemies into a location) and you pick D.Va for her self destruct ability, we can work together to wipe out the whole enemy team.\"  It's a challenge of strategy and coordination, but it's possible that a clever enemy team may have the perfect counter to that strategy, switch to it mid-game, and try to shut us down.  At that point, it becomes about who can execute better.\n\nThe fun part of Overwatch are the clutch moves that just happen to go unbelievably well (wiping out the other team on the objective in overtime with a fingers-crossed Hanzo ultimate aimed in the right direction, through a wall) and the games that come down to seconds or (in-game) inches of positioning at the very end.  If you're playing with other people you know, that shared experience can be a lot of fun.\n\n[I'll bet this guy had a pretty good time with his team on voice comms when this \"play of the game\" came up.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/4m6vej/when_the_beat_drops_l%C3%BAcio_potg/?ref=share&ref_source=link)\n\nEdit:  One really clever thing that the Overwatch team has done is default to keeping randomly matched teams together across matches (though sometimes it will shuffle players around.)  This means that if you find some good accidental synergy with another player in a random quick match, you can work on keeping it going.\n", "created_utc": "1464884849.0", "edited": "1464885575.0", "id": "d3t99le", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_4m7ug2", "parent_id": "t3_4m7ug2", "score": "2", "subreddit": "Overwatch", "subreddit_id": "t5_2u5kl"}, {"author": "Lysenko", "body": "The way it works is that an existing player offers you a buddy invite, from which you make a 21-day trial account.\n\nIf you subscribe during those 21 days, the existing player will have a choice of either adding 1 month to their subscription or getting a PLEX, which is an item that can be used to add a month to someone else's.\n\nSo, the \"51 day trial\" idea is that you buddy invite into a 21-day trial, subscribe, and have the friend who invited you give you the resulting PLEX.

In CCP's case, the 2014-2015 year-over-year change in profit was about $86 million (11 billion Kr., which is the headline number [here](http://www.mbl.is/vidskipti/frettir/2016/02/25/11_milljarda_vidsnuningur_hja_ccp/) ), the difference between their $65 million loss in 2014 (most of which WAS a paper loss due to write-offs of capital assets in the form of WoD) and their $21 million profit in 2015.  Yes, that number is wildly inflated by their 2014 write-down. Disregarding their 2014 write-down of about $68 million, the change in operating profit was about $18 million from 2014 to 2015, and while it's not the $21 million number that you seem to have misinterpreted as that year over year change in profit, it's pretty good.\n\n(My numbers come from [here](http://marketsforisk.blogspot.is/p/ccp-2014-financial-statements.html) for 2014 for CCP because I don't care to slog through the Icelandic government website where those numbers were sourced.)\n\n> In regards to your \"WoD had nothing to do with it\" the financial statement itself stated that the dropping of WoD had a large impact on the financial statements\n\nNot what I said, I said the one-time charge had nothing to do with 2015's $21 million profit number.  Laying off all of WoD's developers, different story.  The difference is one is a \"paper\" action that is an accounting gesture (the write-down, which began and ended on their 2014 financials) and one is a \"real\" action (the layoffs, which have a continuing contribution to reduced costs.)\n\nI just don't understand how a newspaper article talking about a $21 million profit number for 2015 has somehow turned into a year-over-year number in your head.

It's not \"paper\" anything.  They're actually spending less money in relation to what they earn.  The stated $20m profit number in those articles is clearly not a year-over-year number comparing 2014 to 2015, it's the bottom-line net profit from 2015.

They talked a while back about allowing monetization of maps in Starcraft's arcade feature and then backed off because it went over badly to do that with a game for which people had already paid a full retail price.\n\n* If nobody buys Overwatch, they might well reserve the right to make a left turn and go full-on HOTS-style free-to-play with it, but if you think someone's going to promise that that will *never* happen, you're dreaming.", "created_utc": "1446863859.0", "edited": "1446864129.0", "id": "cwrf33x", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_3rtopl", "parent_id": "t3_3rtopl", "score": "1", "subreddit": "Overwatch", "subreddit_id": "t5_2u5kl"}, {"author": "Lysenko", "body": "While I agree that Hearthstone is a simpler game, your suggestion that Blizzard is unnaturally unresponsive is flat-out bizarre.\n\nFor one thing, making rapid or frequent changes to card properties has the potential to cause Blizzard problems in a way that you don't acknowledge.  Unlike WOTC, who sells a physical product, Blizzard has to overcome a certain inherent level of consumer distrust for their digital product.  People fear that they'll buy a thing and it'll change or disappear before their eyes, and that's one of the reasons that it's harder to sell players digital assets than real-world ones.\n\nBoth Magic and Hearthstone can alter the relative power of old cards by introducing new ones, but changing the text for old cards (which each organization treats as a last resort) runs the risk of making customers feel they've been \"baited-and-switched,\" cheated with the promise of one thing and then given another.\n\nIn both games, the development teams solve card or metagame issues by introducing new card sets that make older ones less effective, not by changing the cards themselves (except in the most extreme cases.)  WOTC does this because they have to, they're tied to paper cards.  Blizzard does this because it risks reducing the overall perceived value of their product to change them constantly.  They want the digital asset to feel like a physical card, and changing text breaks that illusion.\n\nAlso, Blizzard has access to better metrics than WOTC does, real-time quantitative metrics, when it comes to how cards are used, what types of decks are in play, and so on.  WOTC can try to gather such metrics from MTGO, but that world isn't necessarily representative of their paper customer base.  Better comprehensive metrics mean that Blizzard has better information than the typical complaining customer.  They do listen, but the pattern of complaints is not the sole input to their decision-making about how to proceed with the game.\n\nMagic is a great game with depth that Hearthstone won't achieve soon, if at all, just by virtue of having been around 23 years.

A few good ones are Redemption Road (www.redemption-road.com), Spectre Fleet (in-game channel \"Spectre Fleet\"), the SirSqueebles stream community (in-game channel \"SirSqueebles\" or www.twitch.tv/SirSqueebles)\n\n*  Join a new-player-friendly PvP-intensive corporation.  This might be something like Noob Mercs in Gallente faction warfare, it might be an educational community like EVE University with PvP opportunities, or it might be a general new-player-friendly corporation like Brave Newbies.  You might also be able to find a decent non-faction-warfare PvP corp that is open to new players.  One good one to check out is Rifterlings (in-game channel \"weflyrifters\").\n\n*  Look around on forums and Reddit for one-time open events to mess around with.  These might be good opportunities to meet and talk to other players.\n\nFinally, if you participate in one of these events and get your ship or pod killed, try sending a message to whomever killed you, say you're brand new, and chat with them a little bit.  You might find an interesting direction or group of people to associate with.\n\nIMPORTANT:  Make contact with one of these communities early, get them to link you a ship fitting suitable for a first-few-days low-skilled character to use, and train the skills needed to fly that ship first.  This skill training might take several hours, depending, and it's a good idea to get started early rather than show up for a scheduled event and discover that you can't fly a suitable ship.\n\nJust remember, enjoying the game stands or falls on connecting with other players, so make that a first priority.

The battleship can't hit your friend because its guns can't track.

Manually clicking in space to ensure you always have some motion along the axis perpendicular to the target, then spiraling in toward him, would have reduced the incoming damage and might have saved you.\n\nManual piloting is an essential component of PvP, particularly in smaller ships.

There is NO reason that a wardec should cause you to stop your activity, but there are some very good procedures for staying alive.  These include:  Having corp insta-undocks and insta-docks for home stations and major trade hubs, so that war targets cannot threaten you while undocking or returning.  Using out of corp alts to scout.  Also, rearranging your activities to be away from the major trade hubs and routes that high-sec merc corps like to frequent.  Using these procedures, our corp has come out ahead on almost every wardec we've been had for the past year.\n\nA hint on fighting back:  high-sec merc corps do not expect you to fight back, and they tend to have SOME (not all) members with more money than sense.  What we've done is load up on cheap, high-damage, low-cost destroyers, and when we scout a war target on the undock alone in system, we'll send someone out on a neutral alt to bump them far enough off that they can't dock up.  Then, 5 or 10 of us undock in destroyers.  We might lose a destroyer or two, but when they lose their half-billion or more battleship, it's pretty embarrassing.\n\nHere's the message that one alliance sent out about us in their last wardec:\n\nhttp://imgur.com/HQysTLK\n\nEdit:  The best thing you can do to avoid future wardecs is not lose anything expensive.  Other corps will look at your war history before wardeccing you, and looking like an easy target is what makes them pick you out of all the other choices.\n\nAnd finally, here's the advisory email that goes out to all members when we get decced:\n\n==========================================\nSo here's the skinny on the wardec:\n\nThese guys just camp trade hubs and try for easy kills on people not paying attention. They are not smart, but they're good at what they do. Get lazy and you'll die. That said: we don't give a fuck. Fly cheap, use our instant undock bookmarks (of which there are many) and don't feed the trolls. Please read the rules below for our wars and understand these are not suggestions, these are rules. If you give away kills because you're not following these rules, you'll be kicked from corp until the war ends since you're a liability.\n\nNow, the important bits for you all as members:\n\nDon't:\nBe in a clone worth more than 40-50 mil ever anywhere for any reason while the war is active.\nBe in a ship with ANYTHING fancy on it or in the cargohold. We shouldn't lose a single faction mod during any of this.\nBe out missioning/ratting/incursioning (which you can't anyways) at any time. I know people need isk, but you'll lose more than you gain.\n[Edit:  My opinion is that if this is the MAIN thing your corp does, you can find ways off the beaten path to continue relatively safely.  Make safe spots. Watch local.  Learn the 5-minute basics of PvP survival and use them.]\nHave local minimized. If a WT (war target) is in local, you need to know immediately, and you need to link the pilot's name and system in corp chat immediately.\nAutopilot anywhere. I mean seriously, what the fuck were you thinking, right? Just don't. And don't sit in space unless you're paying attention at all times.\nLose a single ship to these fascist, neo-nazi bastards. Ok, so they're not nazis, but let's not lose ships.\n\nDo:\nCommunicate. We're not making this complicated with intel channels and such, just let people know in corp chat anytime you see a WT out and about.\nUse common sense. Now is not the time to haul that PLEX you bought in Jita up to Amarr.\nFly cheap. Now, more than ever, it's important we stay affordable until ISK-making starts again at the end of the week. Frigates, dessies, and cruisers are perfect.\nFeel free to move out of Amarr if/when station camping begins. Vacationing to Dodixie is fine.\nMAKE INSTANT-UNDOCK BOOKMARKS FOR ANY STATION YOU USE OFTEN. And make them corp bookmarks. Getting camped in can be easily avoided.\nHave fun. It's always a pain when someone tries to pee in your punch bowl, but stopping playing or hiding is even less fun than losing a couple digital spaceboats.\nAsk questions. If you're new to war, not a big deal. But the better informed you are, the easier life can be.\n\nSo That's pretty much it. Any *serious* questions or comments can be sent by replying all to this mail. Better to have those things in mail where everyone has a chance to see them than in corp chat where offline people will miss out. I'll be keeping roams and things rolling this week, but a good deal of it will be in either faction warfare space or null just to give us some covering fire.\n\nAnd lastly, expect to see some serious shit floating around. There will be plenty of Vindicators and Vigilants and Machariels and such asundry. These guys have plenty of ISK and a pretty serious intent on killing stuff. We will not out-gun an entire alliance, and thus I ask no one take a fight with any WT. Try to get out, if only in your pod. WE WILL FIGHT BACK, but only at those times where we can do it in a coordinated and effective manner. Don't be a hero, wait for a healthy number of us to be online and then we can spring the trap.\n\nGood luck, soldiers, and smoke 'em if you got 'em.\n", "created_utc": "1398847684.0", "edited": "1398848664.0", "id": "ch5u33d", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_24col6", "parent_id": "t1_ch5tnv2", "score": "2", "subreddit": "Eve", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qil9"}, {"author": "Lysenko", "body": ">   Pirate was still a thing.\n\nIt's not really a thing in the sense it used to be, of making money by extorting it from people whose ships you tackle.

WoW was kind of like an EZ-Bake Oven, a toy where you could really only follow the plan in playing with it, but it was pretty cool.\n\nEVE, in contrast, is like one of those huge, motorized Erector sets that I used to covet as a kid, and later on had one of. All these metal parts that you'd use to build things, but no obvious thing to make. Some of the parts had sharp edges and could cut you. It was also easy to lose a bolt on the floor and find it, painfully, walking to the bathroom at night.

Gaming communities, which tend to be male-dominated anyway, can often foster cultures that are not sympathetic to women, and while I think most groups in EVE are mature enough to treat their female members respectfully, you may well encounter behavior that's completely inappropriate.

Generally the actual creator NEVER owns rights to a work made for hire.  (Usually, if someone contracts with a graphic designer or photographer who wishes to retain ownership of the work, there will be a written contract which states so explicitly.  Otherwise, it will by default fall under the \"work for hire\" category and the employer will own it.)\n\nNote that the CCP Alliance Logo Usage License, which claims ownership of a copyright based on a contract of adhesion (a practice that would explicitly not be legally binding if attempted under U.S. law), states that it's to be interpreted based on the law of the Republic of Iceland, so unless you're an expert on Icelandic copyright law (and there may well be only a couple such people in the world) you probably can't offer an accurate opinion about whether submission would actually transfer ownership of the copyright.\n\nEdit:  Here's the WIPO's English translation of the relevant Icelandic statute, as most recently amended.  Interestingly, Iceland requires only an \"explicit agreement\" to transfer copyright.

The trick is learning to engage them properly.\n\nThe two main things you have to deal with on gates or stations are sentry guns and jumping/docking up.\n\nYou have the option to attack anyone with -5 or worse sec status or a criminal or suspect flag without worrying about sentry guns.  Another option for dealing with sentry guns when attacking neutrals is to aggress, immediately warp off, and warp back.  (The sentry guns will not reactivate against you for an act that doesn't lose you sec status, and repeated aggressive acts vs. the same targets within 15 minutes will not lose sec status.)\n\nAs far as docking/jumping:  If you can get the other party to aggress you, they cannot do either for 60 seconds.  If you can tackle them, you'll have 60 seconds to kill them.  There are a few ways to bait out a fight -- fly something that makes you look like an easy target, get yourself tagged with suspect status, or look like you're flying around alone.\n\nUsually you'll want your friend(s) to hang out in an adjacent system, then bait with something somewhat survivable but not too threatening, and get the other party aggressed on you and tackled.  Then your friends can warp in and help.\n\nRegarding D-scan, if in faction warfare space, you'll save a lot of time by checking the FW site beacons first.  You might have 50 celestials in system but only two beacons, and 95% of the time most players in space will be on one of those beacons or at a station.\n\nHope those tips help a little bit!  Also, I do recommend faction warfare, particularly if you and your GF don't pick up additional friends to fly with.

This wouldn't be a useful way to do that.\n\nSo, while I appreciate people offering advice about the fit, because they're trying to be helpful, I'm neither in a position to take that advice (because I have 100 Atrons fitted another way!), nor will I generally take fitting advice from this forum.

Not necessarily, taken in isolation, but there may be a lot of such assumptions built up over many years, and it will take time and human energy to identify every place in the code that might assume something like that.\n\nEdit:  From what they said and what they implemented in Rubicon 1.3, my personal guess is that the current implementation of ship skins requires NO graphics engine or game engine code changes whatsoever.  Blueprints already have the capability to turn one object into another one with a different typeID, and mechanisms exist to get new blueprint items into the game, so they probably could do this with some effort on the art side and a database update, but no software engineering time and probably little QA time.  A more sophisticated solution is certainly easy to design, but will require more costly work that will take time away from other, probably important, projects, so this is a way to assess how excited the players will be about the idea.", "created_utc": "1395267149.0", "edited": "1395267444.0", "id": "cg6vhab", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_20sd5l", "parent_id": "t1_cg6dth8", "score": "2", "subreddit": "Eve", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qil9"}, {"author": "Lysenko", "body": "Soooo because it's easy to do in WebGL, it's easy to do in the EVE client?", "created_utc": "1395205826.0", "edited": "False", "id": "cg6abas", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_20sd5l", "parent_id": "t3_20sd5l", "score": "12", "subreddit": "Eve", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qil9"}, {"author": "Lysenko", "body": "Thing is, it is possible to sort the column in either order.", "created_utc": "1395205776.0", "edited": "False", "id": "cg6aarh", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_20scyv", "parent_id": "t1_cg6a9k1", "score": "1", "subreddit": "Eve", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qil9"}, {"author": "Lysenko", "body": "...

Much of this is due to PvE's requirement for sustainability, while PvP is usually about hitting hard and fast.  So, a fit for one will possibly be very bad for the other, though that's not always the case.\n\nFor most of your character's life, tech 2 modules will be available to use, so most fits will include them in many slots.  (Sometimes characters who can use tech 2 will go for other versions of an item due to fitting requirements, so pay attention to that!)  However, while you can only use tech 1 versions of a module, you can often downgrade those modules.\n\nThe way you find a tech 1 version of a module to downgrade is to Show Info on the module, either by right-clicking or from the (i) button on the item in the fitting window or elsewhere.  There is a tab called \"Variations\" that shows the different versions of that item, and at the bottom, below the list, is a \"Compare\" button that lets you pick attributes to compare.\n\nGenerally, you'll want to compare at least power grid, CPU, the key attributes of the item's effect, and \"Meta level.\"  Meta level is a generic way to categorize the quality of a each version of the item.  Typically, meta 0 is the basic Tech 1 version, meta 1 through 4 are better Tech 1 versions that drop from NPCs, meta 5 is Tech 2, and meta levels above 5 are various rare and expensive versions.\n\nAs a general rule, if you can't use Tech 2, you'll want to be looking at Meta 3 and 4 items, though be sure to compare market prices, since due to certain details of the Tech 2 manufacturing process, Meta 4 items tend to be MUCH higher in price for small benefit.\n\nYou should be aware that some fits, particularly for PvP, are pretty sensitive to the specific stats of the items, and don't work when downgraded.  Usually, this is not a big deal, but it's just something to keep in mind.\n\nRegarding your money situation:  If you have 11 million ISK, you probably should not be flying anything larger or more expensive than a tech 1-fitted destroyer.  I'd consider selling some of the items you received in your missions to date, and don't plan to use.\n\nRemember to take advantage of all the sources of income from missions, if you're going to run them.  The missions reward money in the form of mission rewards and often bounties, yes, but they also reward Loyalty Points (LP), which you can use in the issuing faction's LP store (from the station menu) to buy items that you can resell at a profit. Faction ammunition, implants, and skill books are popular for most factions at low amounts of LP.  LP should be a significant part of your overall reward.  Also, looting and possibly salvaging the wrecks from your missions can be very worthwhile if you are not tearing through them extremely quickly.\n\nOne thing that can be very helpful is to use a Mobile Depot to refit a destroyer from guns in the high slots to tractor beam and salvage units in the highs.  Or, you can go all salvage units and use a Mobile Tractor Unit, which automatically tractor-beams and loots wrecks.  These are probably a little expensive for your current money situation, but once you have another few million, they'll look more appealing.  Normally, you'd want to drop the Mobile Tractor Unit on entering a site initially, before you start fighting, and it will slowly collect and loot wrecks.  Salvaging then becomes easy and fast.\n\nFinally, as to fits, there are many ways to fit a Catalyst or Algos.  I did a Google search for \"Catalyst PvE battleclinic\" and came up with a number of fits, none of which looked perfect to me, but they all looked usable, and more importantly they were all pretty close to each other in overall capabilities.  Generally you'd probably want to use 125mm railguns, since that will keep you at a distance and lessen your need to take damage from the NPCs.\n\nDrones are really valuable for pilots who fly a lot of Gallente ships, but you'll have to combine drone skills with hybrid skills, which means a lot more front-loaded training.  If you can fly Caldari frigates and destroyers as well, you can pick from among pure hybrid ships and focus on gunnery skills for now, before branching out into drones.\n\nHope some of those thoughts help.", "created_utc": "1394624075.0", "edited": "False", "id": "cg0m765", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_207wiy", "parent_id": "t3_207wiy", "score": "11", "subreddit": "Eve", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qil9"}, {"author": "Lysenko", "body": "Thanks.  I imagine it's possible some specific art asset's design drove, or at least inspired, this change, but a LOT of companies out there have struggled with having to make this shift as they realize that it's a necessary step along the way toward a truly photorealistic look.  It's clear that EVE's design has been pushing toward photorealism (and making huge strides toward it) for years now, and the result has been a truly beautiful game.\n\nThey probably put this step off as long as they could, but it's necessary to get the very best look out of an HDRI engine.  Also, I suspect that they did apply some kind of automatic color correction to their nonlinear textures to try to approximate the old look, but it's never going to look exactly the same, and the fact that the new look appears somewhat flatter and less contrasty, but more saturated, is typical of that type of shift.\n\nThe good news is that this should help clean up a lot of very subtle cues in the game that make it not look photoreal, and new assets should look fantastic, assuming CCP has a texture development pipeline that makes it easy for artists to produce linear textures.

Transparency, colored reflection, refraction, and caustics (the streaks of light on the bottom of the swimming pool, for example) become nearly impossible to calculate correctly.  Antialiasing at object edges doesn't work well.\n\nAlso, linear textures give you the ability to paint light sources into textures just by cranking the values way up, part of a larger class of techniques known as HDRI (High Dynamic Range Imaging.) Significant parts of the EVE graphics engine have used HDRI techniques at least as far back as Incarna, but nonlinear textures play badly with those techniques and make certain colors and tones look cartoonish when the stuff around them looks closer to photoreal.\n\nAs for why they haven't held this back until they had updated all the textures out there, EVE has a LOT of art assets and if they waited to complete that task they'd probably get a fully linear texture model into the game sometime around 2025.

I am not one of those people, but I do have some cautions and caveats.\n\nFirst, just to be clear, buying PLEX for cash and selling for ISK is essentially being compensated in-game for paying for some other player's game time. You are paying a higher cash cost than that game time would cost on a regular subscription basis.\n\nIt's relatively easy to buy, say, 5 or 10 PLEX and, because of the sudden influx of a lot of money, lose sight of the cost effectiveness of what you're doing. Going from flying 30 million ISK cruisers to billion-ISK tech 3 ships with shiny modules is a huge step up in risk without the game experience or possibly even the skills to go with it.  Don't be the guy featured on the r/Eve front page with the 44 billion, poorly fit battleship.\n\nA more reasonable approach is to figure out a way to use that money as seed capital for a carefully thought-out strategy to fully fund your activities.  Maybe you do that through trading, or putting together an economical (but still more expensive than you have been spending) ship for some type of high-value PvE.  Maybe you join faction warfare, and your few billion can fund a couple thousand super-cheap frigates until you learn to convert your LP to ISK optimally.\n\nOr, maybe PLEX are a way to fund an extraordinary one-time cost, like a birthday gift for a fellow player or a donation to a community member whose content you appreciate.\n\nMy personal feeling is using PLEX as a stepping-stone to real self-sufficiency is the best goal to set should you go down that route.

Maybe you're doing something and run into a new player who wants to tag along.  Maybe you find someone more experienced who can give you a pointer or two, or even someone who blows up your ship who can suggest some techniques for survival.

Find a public event of some kind related to what interests you, get on comms, and talk to some other players.  Find a corp and get to know them.  Be careful and do your research, but don't get caught up in the paranoia that a lot of EVE veterans like to encourage new players to adopt, because the paradox of EVE is that you can't trust everyone, but if you don't trust anyone your existence in the game will be pretty bleak, and yes, boring.\n\nSometimes my corpmates and I attempt difficult things in the game.  Sometimes we'll just sit on comms and talk about the game and what's going on in it.  Sometimes we'll talk about other things.  Sometimes we log off and go do something else for a week while skills cook.\n\nNevertheless, having the connections that come with a corp mean that I can log in and have some contact with familiar, friendly people, and that's the beginning and end of a good EVE experience.\n\nEdit:  I'm going to offer a blatant plug for the community with whom I fly, because they're welcoming of new players.  I started out as a regular viewer of www.twitch.tv/SirSqueebles, who often runs open fleets for stream viewers out of his in-game channel, SirSqueebles.  A year later, I'm in the corp he leads.  Check out the stream and pop into the channel sometime, and if you're around on a weekend or at the right time of day, come along on one of the viewer fleets out of Amarr.  Even if the fleet's advertised for players in, say, armor cruisers, whatever frigate you can fly with a scram and a web will always be welcome.

Do the same in null and you'll see who holds sov, but you'll also see other locals who live nearby.\n\nTravel in high-sec and you'll see the same thing among PvE-based entities.\n\nIf you don't care where you live but want to be learning and playing the game with a good group of people, first pick what area of the game you think you find interesting, then ask around, here, on the forums, in public channels.

I believe that while I was waiting for the ship to stop, I warped in both cases with the ship at either 0.1 m/s or slightly under.\n\nThe second time, I was much more rigorous about waiting an extended period of time for the ship to get well below 0.0 m/s, and I saw very little difference based on orientation.\n\nMy tests were a very low agility case.  I was testing with a Charon into which my character is barely skilled -- Advanced Spaceship Command and Caldari Freighter are both at 2.  My navigation skills are maxed out, of course, but low skills in those two probably has a significant adverse effect.\n\nThe issue is likely that because the ship takes so long to slow down, it's unlikely to be at a complete stop even after waiting a long time.  So, my initial test probably had a speed of something like 0.1 m/s, pointed far off where I was warping.  With such extremely low agility, reversing even that modest velocity took a significant amount of time.  Essentially, because it was oriented based on its (extremely low) velocity, the ship had to move in a huge circle to turn around.\n\nSo, it looks to me that for a very low-agility ship, even a tiny velocity in a direction well off from my target can greatly increase time into warp.  Webbing probably would help a lot in this instance, just because the difference between 0.1 and 0.01 m/s as a starting speed seems to be significant.\n\nThis confirms the statements people have made here and elsewhere about only velocity vector and not ship orientation as such mattering.  However, it also suggests that for very large, slow ships, where \"passively aligning\" may not get you to a dead stop before you warp, it might be helpful to do so, because a small velocity in a random direction can have a negative impact on time-to-warp.\n\nI suspect that having Advanced Spaceship Command to V may reduce this effect quite a bit, and that I'm being punished for my low skills for the freighter in this instance.\n\nIt's been quite interesting to dive into this, and quite a learning experience.

(Warp when pointed toward the target took about 30 seconds, warp when pointed about 120 degrees away took more than 60 seconds.  In comparison, a Maelstrom always took the same 11 seconds to enter warp regardless of orientation.)  When it had to turn, it appeared to accelerate to the speed at which it entered warp, then wait while it continued turning until it was pointing the correct direction.

The test was not in any way sensitive to the starting point.\n\nA battleship took 11 seconds whether it was pointed directly at or directly away from the target (and consequently turned 180 degrees while accelerating.)\n\nA freighter taking a sharp turn from a dead stop took over 60 seconds to turn about 120 degrees, during which it accelerated to almost warp entry speed and then the speed dial stayed put until the turn completed.  The same freighter pointed at the target took about 30 seconds to enter warp.\n\nIn any case, the original assertion that warp times are entirely independent of ship orientation appears to hold true for some ships, but only those whose rotation completes before they finish accelerating.  The ones that take a lot longer to turn than accelerate will wait until the turn is finished before entering warp, and orientation matters because turn rate is generally constant.\n\nWhether the freighter had to turn 110 degrees or 130 is entirely irrelevant to what I was testing, since making such a sharp turn yielded such a tremendously longer warp time than being pointed roughly at the target.  It would have added or subtracted a few seconds from my sixty-second wait, but regardless it would still be a much longer warp time than the 30 seconds when it was already pointed toward the destination of the warp.", "created_utc": "1393298359.0", "edited": "False", "id": "cfnzdim", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_1yrfya", "parent_id": "t1_cfnyzyi", "score": "1", "subreddit": "Eve", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qil9"}, {"author": "Lysenko", "body": "A few thoughts:\n\nFirst: It's very normal to feel irritated or upset when you lose a ship in a way you feel you might have avoided, but there are things that you can do to mitigate this.  One is to approach PvP roams with an absolutely certain expectation that you'll continue to take fights until you do lose your ship.\n\nI recently started a new character that is about a week old, which I fly with some friends' alts in faction warfare.  For about 35 million ISK I purchased 20 Atrons with all the modules to fit them identically, and I'm currently on the fifth one, with six kills (totaling about 100 million ISK) and four losses (totaling about 10 million ISK, including crap in my cargo hold looted from prior kills.)  When I lose one, if my friends want to keep going, I go back and grab another.  They're forgettable, disposable, and numbered Atron 5 through Atron 20.  I don't contribute very much, other than additional stress to the enemy pilot, some modest damage, and maybe a scram, but it's an excellent exercise in keeping my expectations reasonable.\n\nSecond:  You don't have to derive joy from other people's tears.  Yes, some people do in EVE, and so there are antisocial pastimes like high-sec ganking out there, but you can totally embrace the PvP game without making someone else's misery your goal.  Most of the fleets I run in will ignore ships that are clearly not looking for some kind of fight, unless they do something monumentally absurd like afk autopiloting their industrial slowwwwly to a low-sec gate while we sit on it waiting to jump.  There are plenty of hyper-aggressive people around with -10 sec status or a suspect timer to give you fights all day long.\n\nFinally:  It's not clear from your message how old you are now, but assuming you're very young, and sound it, I can understand why you find interacting with the adults who play the game with you a little threatening. Since it doesn't sound like you have systematic social anxiety problems, which are a thing, one suggestion is to try getting to know the people with whom you fly one by one.  You don't have to key up in a fleet, but if you get to know a few of the people around you as individuals, it'll make it a lot easier to come out of your shell a little more in a group.\n\nYeah, you might stand out as young, but you'll be able to rely on confidence that the people who know you already are on your side.  Furthermore, the adults around you are FULLY capable of saying their own silly/immature/out of place things by themselves, and most likely some of them drive other ones nuts by doing this.  As long as you're willing to listen to what other players have to say, allow that you might be wrong in your understanding of various things in the game, or in life, but also express your opinions with an understanding that you deserve to be heard as well, you'll be fine.\n\nYour post here is well-thought-out, clear, and gets right to the point, so I imagine you can communicate a lot more effectively than many of the adults around you in the game.\n\nEdit:  Looking again, it's not clear from your post whether you're into the PvP thing at all.  If not, just think of the cost of the ship you're flying in terms of what you consider its prospective lifetime.  Even an experienced player can lose a ship in a mission if they disconnect at the wrong time or just get complacent, but many missioning players will go a very long time between having a ship ganked from under them or lost to NPCs.  In that context, you can feel OK flying a ship that hurts a little bit to replace, because you won't have to replace it that often.\n\nI make money, sometimes, running WH and null sites in a remote rep Dominix, which costs about 250 million ISK.  I've lost 3 of them over the last year to forgetfulness about watching D-scan and having someone land on me, and it's always frustrating, but they have earned so much more than their cost that there's never really a question about whether to replace them.  Thing is, they're very effective at what they do, and other than occasionally playing around with something like an Ishtar or a T3 just to see the differences, I'm not super-tempted to replace them with another ship type for their purpose.  Find something that's a good balance between cost and effectiveness that you like flying and fly it to death.  You'll get very good with the ship and the fit and when it does come time to buy another one you'll be more than ready, even if it does sting a little bit to have someone kill your baby. :)", "created_utc": "1393297381.0", "edited": "1393299388.0", "id": "cfnywdv", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_1yuq25", "parent_id": "t3_1yuq25", "score": "30", "subreddit": "Eve", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qil9"}, {"author": "Lysenko", "body": "I'll give you a somewhat different perspective.  I'm in a corporation that was founded and is still run by [SirSqueebles](http://www.reddit.com/user/sirsqueebles), who was featured in last week's [dev blog](http://community.eveonline.com/news/dev-blogs/community-spotlight-sir-squeebles/).\n\nOur recruiting is careful and slow -- normally, new members come from those who join SirSqueebles' stream fleets, and will be invited to join once they're familiar faces who are known for bringing a constructive, attentive attitude.  The thing is, there are probably 100 regular stream viewers who would seriously consider joining if recruiting were thrown open.  We could probably have those numbers overnight -- the reason it doesn't happen is to keep a consistent, positive culture within the corp and try to center recruiting on people who fit that culture well.\n\nWe also have a very tight focus:  Solo and small-gang PvP, generally non-faction-warfare, though some of us dabble in FW on alts.  We do lots of other stuff too, but it's generally focused on funding our PvP, one way or another.\n\nBecause our experience is built around streaming, it's not a typical corporation's situation, but I think there are some good lessons to take away.  First, it can greatly aid your recruiting to find a way to reach out to the community.\n\nMaybe you can open certain activities to the public, getting help from corp members to run them?  A player's a lot more likely to join a one-time activity than to switch corps, since even though the latter is pretty easy to do and in fact fairly low-commitment, it FEELS like a big deal.  Having public activities that you get the word out about in forums or whatever can give players outside your corp opportunities to meet and team up with your corp members, and you'll inevitably find people who are eager to join if they have a good time.\n\nSecond, consider whether focusing on numbers is the real issue.  A member may complain about numbers or activity when they really only need a couple other players interested in doing what they're doing.  If players are online but aren't communicating or teaming up for things, that can be an issue of them not feeling cohesive, not getting to know each other well, not having a full range of options for communicating with each other about their plans and what they want to do, or not enough people helping start initiatives or organizing things.  Some of these things can be improved by recruiting people who are socially active with corp members and can serve as centers of organization.  Others can be improved by encouraging regular communication by voice, for example, or defining a clear focus for the corp that centers on particular interests so members will be more likely to want to team up.\n\nHope that helps a bit!\n\nEdit:  Running public events of some kind can serve as a way to get numbers up in a practical sense but without actually having to give up on your culture or standards when inviting new players.  In a sense, it can be the best of both worlds, and it will make the people you do recruit appreciate each other that much more, for the additional cohesion and effectiveness when doing things in-corp.", "created_utc": "1393281924.0", "edited": "1393282286.0", "id": "cfnrne6", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_1ysmf0", "parent_id": "t3_1ysmf0", "score": "3", "subreddit": "Eve", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qil9"}, {"author": "Lysenko", "body": "Scanning the hardest signatures is made significantly faster by maxing skills and using all available boosts to scan strength.

Edit:  For example, the Maelstrom entered warp in 11 seconds when pointed at the target and when pointed 180 degrees away.\n\nWith the Charon, however, alignment was a very different process.  A 120 degree turn from a dead stop took over 60 seconds to enter warp.  Meanwhile, warping from a dead stop with the ship pointed toward the destination took about 30 seconds.

Their scanning skills are definitely the best investment they can make in terms of cost for benefit.  This player's potentially going to lose a lot of scanning ships, and yeah, doubling the cost for one module is not a sensible move.\n\nBut, for a moment, let's talk about another common exploration use case, which happens to be mine, a scanning alt in a C3 wormhole.  With everything else maxed out, the extra 5% bonus to scan strength from a Sisters launcher is only really helpful on the hardest to scan sites, for example -0.9 truesec data and relic sites in null, C6 wormhole entrances, and things like 10/10 combat sites.\n\nHowever, those turn out to be the most important things to scan.  A lot of the monetary value of wormhole life is easy access to deep null, where I'll often run with a few other people, all of us in remote rep Dominixes on our mains and high-skill, well-equipped scanning alts who fan out from a null entrance to catalog everything we can find nearby, running 7/10 sites and up as we find them.  Time is at a premium when scanning, because lingering too long can draw unwanted attention, although the low traffic in deep null is on our side.  Once in a very rare while we do get complacent and lose a ship, but it's almost always a 250 million ISK Dominix and just about never a covops frigate.  That's ok, because the sites normally pay out 150 million to multiple billion ISK each and take maybe 20 minutes to run, when we're not super-focused on blitzing them.\n\nIn the wormhole, scanning is a continual, tedious housekeeping requirement that everyone pitches in to do.  Sigs change names every day, bookmarks need maintenance, and the static exit changes every 24 hours.  Also, other exits will open up at random, which requires immediate scanning to see what's on the other side.  Even small increments to scan stats save time and difficulty over the long run -- when I switch from my maxed-out, implanted, Sisters launcher, tech 2 scan module scanning alt to my main who's merely 4/5 on the skills and runs with the Sisters launcher and rigs, I absolutely feel the difference.  It's not major, but it's noticeable, particularly on the hardest-to-scan sigs.\n\nFinally, combat scanning is an important application in wormholes, and frigates can be as hard to scan as some of those most difficult signatures.\n\nThe point being that wormhole dwellers scan the hardest sites in the game in large volume, usually invest many hundreds of millions into their exploration fleets, and ultimately scanning fatigue winds up being an important limiting factor for their potential to make money.  However, when a typical C3 data site yields over 100 million ISK for 20 minutes to run and null sec DED sites are better than that for the same time, a 40 million ISK module on one covert ops frigate is just a small piece of a big machine, and it's one that's targeted at easing the most tedious piece of the entire process.\n\nSo no, I wouldn't fit a deadspace MWD on a scanning ship, any more than I'd fit a Sisters launcher on an interceptor.  However, nobody's ended up making the front page of anything using a single faction module that adds to the effectiveness of the ship's obvious, primary purpose.\n\nThe right way to look at the cost is:  Scanning faster means more time running sites, less time lingering in hostile space with the covert ops ship, and an easier, less frustrating scanning experience.  A high-end scanning frigate fit is maybe 80 million ISK, about the same as running one C3 site.  And, used as intended, they're pretty difficult to lose.  My losses in these ships have usually been trying to hero tackle a wormhole visitor with a fleet racing up behind me, but they're unfortunately not very good for that, and too expensive to use that way.

There's \"master looting,\" which allows a designated individual to hand it out.  There's \"free-for-all\" which allows whoever gets there first to pick it up.  Finally, there's \"need or greed.\"\n\nWhen an item drops, \"need or greed\" looting prompts everyone in the party to click one of four choices, \"need,\" \"greed,\" disenchant, or pass.  If one or more players pick \"need,\" the game rolls a random number between 1 and 100, then assigns the item to the highest roll.  If NOBODY clicks \"need,\" the same procedure happens for those who clicked \"greed.\"  If nobody clicks \"need\" or \"greed,\" if someone picked \"disenchant,\" and someone in the party has sufficient disenchanting skills to turn the item into raw enchanting materials, that happens and the resulting materials are distributed to the person with the highest roll.\n\nSo, anyone who clicks \"need\" has priority over anyone who clicks \"greed.\"  Generally, rolling \"need\" on an item expresses intent to use it, while rolling \"greed\" expresses an intent to sell the item, keep it as a souvenir, or whatever.\n\nThere are various agreed-upon social rules among most prearranged groups about when rolling need or greed is appropriate, and automatically-matched groups have additional built-in rules to ensure that players can't roll need on items that are of obviously low value to their class, so that those rules don't have to be discussed and decided at the start.\n\nEdit:  For groups playing on voice comms, normally asking \"May I roll need on that?\" is considered polite behavior before doing so.

Unlike many other activities in the game, though, doing anything worthwhile in a wormhole (besides traveling, for which they can be very convenient once scanned down) requires having strong basic skills trained up and careful attention to fits and choice of ship.  Good cloaking and scanning skills are essential.  You can drop probes, cloak up, and do all your scanning while cloaked, which makes it nearly impossible for someone to get the drop on you like that.\n\nNote that data and relic sites in wormhole systems have NPCs, and in fact are generally harder than normal combat sites in those same wormhole systems.  NPCs in wormholes (called \"Sleepers\") are strong and difficult to kill compared to most of those you'll find outside.\n\nWormholes also do not display players in system in the local channel, although you can talk in it if you want to give away who you are.\n\nI had a fun WH experience the other day -- A corpmate scanned down a C2 with two connecting high-sec systems and some other WH connections.  He was using this to get to null sec, but I decided to run some sites in the C2 in an Ishtar.  I dropped a mobile depot at a safe and a mobile tractor unit at my site, and realized after I'd cleared the site that I could refit to use multiple salvagers to salvage more quickly.  So, I popped out of the WH (taking my loot with me but leaving the MTU and the Mobile Depot in) to pick up a few salvage units.\n\nWhen I returned, the warp from my entrance to the mobile depot took me past the site I'd run.  I was spamming D-scan, as I often do, and noticed that as I passed the site, eight combat scanner probes were on top of my mobile tractor unit and my remaining wrecks.\n\nI considered worst cases.  Worst case was one or more T3 cruisers cloaked up next to the MTU, waiting for me to arrive and finish salvaging.  Under no condition would I be able to take such a thing on.  Best case, I guess, was someone arriving and checking the MTU and finding nothing, then leaving.  Good luck w/ that.\n\nI warped in at about 70 km, cloaked up and sat there for a bit (which may not have been a fantastic choice, but it didn't backfire this time), then decloaked, dropped sentries, killed the MTU, and one by one killed each wreck.

Too much lingo in my answer.  Crimewatch is CCP's name for the portion of their server software that manages suspect and criminal statuses, limited engagements, kill rights, and player security statuses, as well as triggering Concord and (I think) empire navy responses.\n\nWhile the new behavior may feel less \"wild West\" to you, it actually has resulted in a lot more combat in high and low sec, because it's relatively easy to get a suspect timer and attacking a suspect is always allowed.  Players use suspect timers to bait fights on high-traffic stations, fleets fly around in low-sec preferring to attack those with suspect timers because it doesn't cause a sec status hit or cause gate or station guns to attack, and so on.\n\nOf course, having a suspect timer does put you in a disadvantaged position in terms of others being able to initiate combat with you in high sec, but not vice versa (if you want to keep your ship.)\n\nRegarding your second question:  Attacking another unflagged player's ship in high sec, or attacking a player's pod in low sec, gives you a 15-minute \"criminal\" timer, which will cause Concord to attack and kill you if you are in high sec and allow other players to attack you in low sec.\n\nIf you steal from another player's wrecks or cans, repair someone who is engaged in combat that would normally get you a suspect or criminal timer if you were in their place, or attack another unflagged player's ship in low sec, you get a 15-minute \"suspect\" timer, which allows other players to engage you for 15 minutes but doesn't cause gate guns or Concord to attack you.\n\nIf a player attacks you in high sec or low sec, and you have a criminal or suspect timer, each of you get a 5-minute \"limited engagement\" timer, represented by a bluish-green timer at the top of your screen.  This allows you to kill and pod the other player without penalty.\n\n(Note that this means if you are suspect and a player attacks you in high sec, you, and only you, are allowed to kill and pod that player within the next five minutes!  This timer is refreshed each time they initiate a new aggressive action against you, so as long as they keep fighting back, the timer will be continually refreshed at five minutes.)\n\nA \"kill right\" is created when a player acquires a criminal timer by attacking your ship in high sec, or podding you in low sec, if they didn't otherwise have the right to do so by a limited engagement or a suspect or criminal timer.  Kill rights appear on your character screen, and for a period of time (I think 30 days?) you can activate the kill right, which will give the other player a 15-minute suspect timer.  You activate a kill right by selecting the character's ship while in space and clicking on the cross-hairs button in the Selected Item window.\n\nYou can make your kill rights available to others for a price you set, and any other player can pay that price to activate the kill right.  So, if you have a kill right against you, it's possible that you might suddenly go suspect because any player around you has activated it with the intent to attack you.\n\nWhy did they make these changes?  A major reason is that the old system was very difficult to understand, and even to document, so players were often confused and developers had difficulty validating the correctness of changes to the code that implemented it.  Another reason was that large battles in low sec were very much worse than in null sec because the old system was very hard on the servers from a performance standpoint.\n\nHere's a page that describes the new behavior in more detail:\n\nhttps://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Crimewatch\n\nAnd, here's the dev blog that describes the differences between the old and new systems, explains the reasoning behind them, and also completely documents the new timer behavior:\n\nhttp://community.eveonline.com/news/dev-blogs/73443\n\nHope that helps.\n\nEdit:  Fixed description of limited engagement timers.", "created_utc": "1392089481.0", "edited": "1392090526.0", "id": "cfc9qhj", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_1xkpwi", "parent_id": "t1_cfc8g6n", "score": "1", "subreddit": "Eve", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qil9"}, {"author": "Lysenko", "body": "One thing you should be aware of is that the speed of a ship can provide some very clear clues about its fit, and you should make sure to have speed on your overview, both relative and absolute.

(Save active repair modules for when you've actually taken damage, because they are costly to run.)  Your ship will turn that direction, which will be at about a 30-45 degree angle from your enemy, and start accelerating.  Wait until you've moved some distance, then turn the camera back to face your enemy (which doesn't change the direction of your ship) and double-click halfway toward the side of the screen again.\n\nDoing this repeatedly lets you get closer to the other ships while making sure that from their point of view you're moving side-to-side instead of coming straight at them.  It will cause you to spiral in toward your enemy rather than heading straight toward them.\n\nWhy this works: Turret weapons have more trouble hitting the faster you're moving to one side or the other, but they can do full damage when you're heading straight-on toward someone.  If you're in a small, weak ship, this is how you can approach something larger without getting killed in one shot.  A fast frigate vs. a battleship would die in one volley if it headed straight at the BS, but spiraling in like this might not take any damage at all.\n\nIf you ever hear an experienced player, or a fleet commander on a stream or something, say \"keep your transversal up,\" that's what they mean.\n\nEdit:  Double-clicking in space to pilot manually is in the basic ship piloting tutorial, but I know almost nobody who read it carefully enough to notice or understand.  They should fix this.\n\nEdit 2:  What you need to know about \"approach,\" \"orbit,\" and \"keep at range\" is that they generally make you head directly toward or away from the target.  Approach makes you travel toward them, keep at range makes you travel directly away, and orbit takes you directly toward or away and then makes a 90 degree turn right when you're at the orbit distance.  So, avoid approach and keep at range in combat unless you know exactly what you're doing, and only hit orbit when you're at the orbit distance.  For example, with orbit set at 6km, you could spiral in as above and hit orbit right at 6km distance and be safe, but if you hit orbit at 12km, you'll point your nose (and your velocity) right at the enemy, and they will be able to get some hits.\n\nAlso, note that missiles do less damage as your speed gets higher, but the direction doesn't matter.
