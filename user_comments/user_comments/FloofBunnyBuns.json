I tried getting in from highschool and was denied but DVC has a ton of opportunities and great programs that really beefed up my application and the classes really prepared me for here. \n\nCommunity College difficulty varies a lot depending on the school and what classes you're taking. Hard science classes like physics and chem were super intense at DVC, but a lot of GenEd classes were easy. However, there's a ton of tutoring available and professors almost always have time/ want to help you outside of class.

Never felt uncomfortable being openly queer near SF. Plus, it can be quite diverse. In general I like California a lot because it feels a bit like an oasis from other states which are going backwards on LGBT laws. Of course, this is just one state of many and I reccomend looking up other queer friendly cities to see what best fits where you would like to live, I'm just biased because I grew up here haha! \n\nCollege is definitely the best route to setting up a life in the US. Computer science is a wonderful profession to go into! Lots of amazing job opportunities and good wages. I know the price of college is TERRIFYING. Many of my friends were low income, and received little if at all financial support from family. However, there are many scholarships and financial aid available especially as a US citizen. I started off in community college and it was PERFECT for me. A lot less pressure, people tend to be friendlier, and way way cheaper. \n\nI know the wait until you can go to college feels awful, and feels like it'll be forever. While my experiences are no where near as intense to what you might be going through, I grew up in a homophobic household and it felt like things would never end, but now that I'm finally independent, life is so so much better. \n\nIt sounds corny to say, but things WILL get better. \u2764\ufe0f", "created_utc": "1661554701.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ilxlcek", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_wybdjq", "parent_id": "t3_wybdjq", "score": "16", "subreddit": "IWantOut", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r5hw"}, {"author": "FloofBunnyBuns", "body": "Oski what is your opinion on pineapple on pizza?", "created_utc": "1661545555.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ilwzkj8", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_wyhm4f", "parent_id": "t3_wyhm4f", "score": "27", "subreddit": "berkeley", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh9w"}, {"author": "FloofBunnyBuns", "body": "I try not to skip days, but there's a looot of times where either for emotional/schedule reasons it feels impossible to do something I'll do 5 minutes of Duolingo or watch a short video. \n\nI know if I skip a day I'll get into the spiral of oh I can skip tomorrow, maybe I'll skip the day after that too..... \n\nKeeping a streak holds me accountable and makes me quite motivated and those \"easy days\" give me enough confidence to do more intensive studying when I'm ready.", "created_utc": "1661543146.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ilwtku8", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_wx4ax5", "parent_id": "t3_wx4ax5", "score": "1", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "FloofBunnyBuns", "body": "I met a bunch of non-Brazilians learning Brazilian Portuguese from my university.
