If you haven\u2019t seen it, there\u2019s this scene where the guy is giving the girl he likes advice on how to give a wedding toast for her sister. He told her keep it light.

Maybe he grew up with that kind of model and wants to replicate it?\n\nMy other guesses could be that, since he has anxiety, maybe he feels upset by something in the relationship but can\u2019t properly communicate it and it comes out in teasing?\n\nIf teasing is a hard \u2018no\u2019 for you, does he know that and does he also know that it\u2019s a circumstance from your life experiences that came before him? That it\u2019s more a part of your approach to relationships, and not just about him. It can be confusing if you ever tease him. If the gates are closed for him, they must also be for you as well. \n\nI know it can be tough to trust yourself after dealing with n relationships, but you will know best if this teasing feels familiar because it\u2019s toxic or because it is triggering past pain.
