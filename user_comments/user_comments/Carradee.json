If you want to change them, then the way to do that is to address whatever's causing them.\n\nIn this particular case, it sounds as if the root of your feelings is how you're emotionally perceiving CNC as mocking rape survivors. That sort of feeling comes from internal framing and personal subconscious correlations. Adjusting it requires adjusting your framing and-or conditioning yourself to adjust the baggage your subconscious dumps in.\n\nAnd again: Your feelings *are* valid. Wanting to change them is *also* valid. If you wanted to retain your feelings, that would be valid, too--though in that case, I would advise better targeting them at the specific form(s) of CNC that actually bother you; your current framing is actually demonizing some folks' natural perception of sex.\n\nFor example, a sex-indifferent person who just wants to spend time with their partner and literally does not care what they do together, and the partner wants sex? Their acquiescence to sex qualifies as CNC, even if there's enthusiastic desire to spend time with the partner, because that enthusiasm isn't about the sex itself. Sometimes such persons only find out they're engaging in CNC well into a relationship and their partner ends up feeling like (and-or getting lambasted by others as) a rapist.\n\nWhen you're perceiving CNC as mocking rape survivors, you're including such sex-indifferent persons in who you're viewing as mocking you. I highly doubt you're intending to do that. Better identification of what precisely you're taking issue with can help you address it or communicate it.\n\nAs it is, I'm having to guess what specifically is bothering you about CNC, which is an umbrella ultimately involves shifting what cues convey consent (and-or the lack thereof) from the usual defaults that apply in everyday conversation. Consent is still a required part of it. Rape lacks consent entirely. That's a foundational difference between the two, one that you evidently usually respect in other contexts, so there has to be something else going on in your subconscious or hindbrain causing you to connect CNC to rape.\n\nRapeplay actually one of the forms of CNC that have more clearly defined cues consistent with non-CNC activity. Rapeplay just has overt definition-swapping, and it has specific defined cues for when that definition-swapping applies. Rapeplay is acting and ultimately a communication game.\n\nThere are some forms of CNC that are *far* more \"fuzzy\" about boundaries, like free use, intoxicated play, mind play, and somnophilia play. Considering your expressed issues with how anonymity affects consent, I'm a bit surprised those don't bother you more than rapeplay. They share how anonymity adjusts the trustworthiness of (and ability to check) some factors that many people (but not everyone) deem relevant for consent, *without* the way anonymity sabotages some social factors that have unavoidable impact on consent (though how precisely they affect a person's consent is subjective).\n\nIf you don't view DD/LG as mocking people who were molested as children, then seeking to view rapeplay consistently with how you view the DD/LG kink could help?

Orientation can contribute to a person's [sex stance](https://www.lgbtqia.wiki/wiki/Sex_Stances), which is probably why asexuals are more likely to be averse to having sex than the general population is, but there isn't a direct, specific causation there.\n\n**Someone being asexual just means there's a lack of sexual attraction**: a lack of \"Ooo, I'm drawn to that person for the purpose of sexytimes!\" This lack may be complete, with a person never feeling sexual attraction, or it may be partial or contextual, as in the case of dexisexual people and people under the \"gray-asexual\" part of the asexual umbrella.\n\nNow, sexual attraction is commonly among the reasons a person chooses to have sex, but even for people who value that, it's not the only reason. If it were, people would have sex with everyone they were attracted to and sexual fidelity wouldn't be a thing at all.\n\nSo, even if your partner lacks sexual attraction entirely, you can take the list of reasons that a person might choose to have sex, remove sexual attraction from the list, and any and all of the other reasons could apply to your partner. \"Wanting to feel closer to a partner you care about\" is one such possible reason, in part due to the hormonal side effects of sexual activity.\n\nUrge to masturbate also exists independently of orientation.\n\nFrom what you describe, it does sound likely that your partner is on the asexual spectrum. If this is causing issues for you, whether with a lack of feeling loved or a lack of sexual needs being met for some other reason (because people do vary in what they need and to what degree), you can try having conversations with your partner to discuss what activities \"scratch that\" for you and how your partner perceives them, because it's quite possible that there are activities that you perceive as sexual and your partner does not.\n\nHope this helps!", "created_utc": "1658943539.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ihvnj8d", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_w9kj1h", "parent_id": "t3_w9kj1h", "score": "7", "subreddit": "asexuality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qv0q"}, {"author": "Carradee", "body": ">Do allos actually like the thought of someone imagining having sex with them?\n\nAs with pretty much *everything*: Some do, some don't.

A percentage of the population does that regularly, whether out of normalization to such behavior (so they don't realize it's harmful) or personal inclination and preference to engage in such behavior (generally due to the impact dark tetrad traits have on their personality).\n\nCommon belief in psychology is that such self-justification is always subconscious and unintentional, but I've outright known people who do such things intentionally. So, my personal anecdote demonstrates that it's sometimes intentional, but anecdote can say nothing about actual incidence.\n\nHow much of the population engages in such toxic behavior at all (i.e., including unintentional folks) looks to be unknown. Estimates seem to range from 10%-35% of the general population--significant enough to be able to easily have echo chambers that perpetuate normalization, but still a minority.\n\n(In comparison, the percentage of the population that identifies as kinky tends to be in the 35%-50% range, but that's highly impacted by how a person defines \"kinky\". For some people, just stuff like fluffy handcuffs are sufficient to call themselves kinky, while others consider that entirely vanilla.)\n\nThere definitely *are* people who leverage kink to seek to justify toxicity. The definitions of \"consent\" and rules in many kink communities do limit the ways a person can engage in such self-justification and still be accepted in the community. This is why someone dissing or belittling their local community is often a red flag.\n\nSo altogether, is it a lot of people in the community who use kink terms to mask toxic behavior? Depends on how you're defining \"the community\", but probably not. Are there are lot of people in general who use kink terms to mask toxic behavior? Depends on how you're defining \"a lot\", but probably, though it's still going to be a minority of the population in general.\n\nThe \"issue\" that pops up is that kinky folks are *also* probably a minority of the population, and it's unclear what degree of overlap there is between people who *are* kinky by whatever definition and those who leverage kink to suit their own toxicity.

This is true of even the capitalization, spelling, and punctuation rules.", "created_utc": "1657032223.0", "edited": "False", "id": "iey4krw", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_vr7xec", "parent_id": "t1_iex6txh", "score": "0", "subreddit": "learndutch", "subreddit_id": "t5_2t6rf"}, {"author": "Carradee", "body": ">This is advanced linguistics...\n\nIt's taught to native English speakers in middle or high school, so no, it actually isn't.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>I think in English, it is more common to use plural in sentences such as 'Kids, get your books' where each kid gets just one book.\n\n...That sentence is imperative mood, not indicative mood, and it's not even the same tense as \"We are eating a sandwich.\"\n\n*Because* it's imperative mood, it's actually \"Kids, (you) get your books.\" (The names of the grammatical mood stuff is a bit advanced, but how imperative mood works is elementary-to-middle school level.) So, due to the tense, your example is telling each child to get multiple books.\n\n(See the single comma after \"kids\" and before \"get\"? That means \"kids\" isn't and can't be the subject of the sentence. It's what we term a \"noun of direct address\". It's the same part of speech as \"Mom\" in \"Mom, I'm eating a sandwich.\")\n\nHowever, in English, using plurals *is* the usual way to fix/avoid subject-object agreement issues that cause implications that aren't intended. But that's in indicative mood. E.g., \"We are eating sandwiches.\"\n\n(And while this isn't relevant to what the syntax literally conveys, it also *is* possible for multiple people to share the same sandwich or book. Some are even designed to be shared that way.)\n\nAside from that, you've completely ignored the question I asked by using \"je\" where I asked after the significance of \"een\". That greatly changes the meaning in English, and at least from what I've read on Dutch grammar so far, it seems to also do so in Dutch, though that could also be a side effect of me reading about Dutch grammar in English so far.\n\nIf \"We eten een boterham\" can literally mean that each person has their own sandwich, then the Dutch indefinite article \"een\" doesn't have quite the same meaning that the English indefinite article \"a/an\" does. I am specifically asking after that, the root that causes the applications with indefinite articles.\n\nIf you don't know that nuance, fine! :-) I'm sure a lot of people don't. I'm asking in case someone does.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>In Dutch you'd rather say, 'Jongens, pak je boek' or something.\n\nThat \"or something\" is indicating that you're not actually certain. I'm uncertain if that's intentional or accidental, since you also use \"rather\" where it looks as if you intended something like \"instead\".\n\n(This isn't a judgement, mind you; just a fyi to alert you what specifically is causing me to be uncertain I'm getting the meaning you intend.)\n\nBut in English, all these sentences have different meanings, though sometimes there can be some overlap in meaning in specific contexts:\n\n* Children, get a book.\n* Children, get books.\n* Children, get your book.\n* Children, get your books.\n* Children, get the book.\n* Children, get the books.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>But in neither language is this a fixed rule, I think.\n\nIt *is* actually a rule in English, just one of the ones that's commonly overlooked or sidestepped in everyday speech.

So many of the arguments utilized in those circles *only* make sense from an ace and/or aro perspective.\n\n(To be clear, for anyone unfamiliar with the terms: \"ace\" means asexual, experiencing a lack of sexual attraction; \"aro\" means aromantic, experiencing a lack of romantic attraction. Someone's ability to enjoy romance or sex and their willingness to personally engage in romance or sex exist independently of each other and their orientation.)\n\nNow, a person can only know what they have opportunity to know, and the psychological quirk of illusory truth effect means that repeating something causes it to feel true whether or not it actually is true. So the intrinsically problematic arguments being so widely used in the communities doesn't mean that aro, ace, or aroace persons aren't still a minority--anyone who's in that environment and regularly exposed to the arguments is going to be affected by that illusory truth effect, often exacerbated by consensus bias. I'm just meaning that the way the arguments have such a foothold in the culture make me suspect that minority is a bigger percentage than is commonly believed or recognized.\n\nAnd then a number of counterarguments against purity culture hinge on unspoken assumptions or framings that don't work from the ace, aro, or aroace perspective, so we can't follow them unless or until someone bothers to fill in those gaps for us. This can greatly sabotage or otherwise complicate some persons' ability to comprehend the issues with the arguments, which doesn't help matters.\n\nLike, I had no idea that some people actually have urges for sex or romance as a pastime that's enjoyed over other things; I thought it was just something many people *chose* to focus on, where they could easily substitute other things when and if they wanted. That's how *I* perceive it (I also lack infatuation, apparently), and I was an adult before anyone bothered to explain that, well, no, that's not how it works for most people.\n\nAnd my orientation was so obvious that my ace-aware friends, when I came out, were startled that I hadn't known that already. They just assumed I was aware and joking around when my communication showed my confusion. (To be clear, their assumption was entirely consistent with my sense of humor.)\n\nBut even then, nobody bothered to explain how much many people's decisions about nonplatonic relationships are affected by feelings I just don't experience. Others usually include rational things in their criteria, yes, but I figured most people viewed attraction as a *preference*.\n\n(You can probably guess some other topics that my misunderstandings sabotaged my comprehension of.)\n\nRealizing many people view it as a *requirement* has helped me a lot when communicating on this topic. My list of requirements for any nonplatonic relationship is a few dozen items long, and attraction isn't on it. I *also* only discovered how unusual my personal requirements and non-issues even *are* in the past few years, after a series of events that caused my friends and I to realize we were having a perception disconnect and we worked together to figure out what was going on.\n\nI go into all that as an illustration of how comprehension is affected by perception and communication. American evangelicalism in general teaches and enforces specific lines of reasoning as if they're objective fact when they're actually subjective and highly dependent on the person's personality and other factors. This policing of thought and reasoning is a form of psychological abuse, and it's inherently damaging.\n\n(This is aside from how modesty has to do with *moderation*. The verses translated with the word are talking about stuff like having a healthy amount of pride, not so much you love only yourself and not others or so little that you only love others and not yourself. Thus why even today, \"a modest loan\" isn't talking about how much skin is showing; in the Bible, \"modest apparel\" isn't, either. From the etymology and word usage I've traced, it looks like the interpretation about skin is what created that definition in the word.)\n\nI personally have found awareness of this broader pattern helpful when bridging communication disconnects with people who sincerely *want* to understand, and with tackling various inherently damaging things from my own background.

A person can't know your boundaries unless you tell them. They might guess or have some idea of where to ask, but that's going to be based on their own experience; when your boundaries are in unusual places or places that another person hasn't witnessed before, it's unreasonable and quite ignorant of psychology to expect others to be able to confirm in advance.\n\nDifferent people communicate differently, too, and it's quite possible to unintentionally communicate to someone that a certain kind of communication (whatever that kind is) is welcome even when that wasn't what you intended or what your communication meant to you.

Get your own safe deposit box if you have to (if you can), and get everything you can't bear to lose out of the place *before* your parents know you're seeking to leave, if at all possible.\n\nExpect to lose a lot of belongings; your parents may have legal right to claim a lot of your things were actually theirs (depending on where you live and how the paperwork is), and parents who are as controlling as you're describing sometimes seek to paint a child who leaves as a thief.\n\nDo your best to *sneak* out--it's ideal to be out before they realize you're going.

Neither argument erases that the \"allies\" usage exists, and such usage can only be erasure if \"allies\" is the *only* meaning someone claims the \"A\" has or can have.\n\nErasure requires speaking in an exclusionary way, such as by claiming a term *can't* refer to something that some people use it to refer to.

And we all have things we know more about than others do.\n\nCommunicating about things you know a lot about with folks who don't share your foundational knowledge is its own skill, separate and distinct from the expertise itself. This is a lot of why the more north of average your IQ is, the more likely it is that you'll experience people calling you stupid due to their own inability to comprehend what they're saying.\n\n(Note that IQ is *not* some be-all, end-all for intelligence; it's just a very rough metric for certain types of quantifiable intelligence that *easily* result in this bane of expertise that I've described.

Some people get upset by that, perceive me as being pretentious, etc.--but that's ultimately *their* perception. I can't prevent that. So I instead focus on seeking to limit what jargon I use in standard conversation to the \"root\" concepts that someone can *easily* look up if they need or want to, sometimes with explanations or double-checks if an explanation is necessary.\n\nThe result is that my friend group accepts me as the information magpie I am, and many of them actively enjoy when I happen to mention things I then end up having to explain.

Concluding that relationship is toxic would require there to be a pattern of either her making inappropriate demands and/or you citing dependent clauses as if they were stated as complete sentences, and there's not enough here to say that's the case.\n\nBut that conflict in your summary of events shows a major communication problem itself.

Sex is part of how they communicate love, where lack of it feels unloving. If your girlfriend is one of those people, your options are:\n\n1. You sometimes play-act sexual attraction (*if you want to*\\--a SO's feelings can be why someone does this, but there has to be want on your side; this can be traumatizing if done purely for the other person).\n2. You communicate further with her to find out what actions and touches communicate love to her, to see if you can find overlap between that and what you are comfortable with (and enjoy). It's possible some actions or touches that she finds sexual aren't perceived sexually by you, which is how some sex-averse persons navigate this.\n3. You break up due to sexual incompatibility. It's not a matter of understanding vs. lack thereof; it's a matter of having different relationship needs. This can happen even between allos.\n\nFrom how you describe the situation, option 1 sounds as if it's not something that would work for you. Option 2 requires more direct, explicit conversation skills than you show in your post, so that'll probably have a significant learning curve if you try that route.

If so, that's toxic, and they would bear blame for that toxicity.\n\nUnless that happened, **you** chose to lose the weight, *assuming* it would have certain side effects, and that's on your head.

So for allosexuals, that's the conventional experience of sexual attraction. Assuming that *anything* else that's true of one allosexual will necessarily be true of another necessarily involves an [association fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_fallacy), and that includes what precisely allosexuals *do* with that attraction.\n\n(Fallacies are irrational argument structures. There are two types, formal and informal. Formal ones are objectively mappable as inherently and necessarily irrational, where it's literally impossible for an argument using one to support itself. Informal ones are objectively mappable as inherently and necessarily problematic, hinging on assumptions rather than facts. I'm admittedly oversimplifying a little, but this is all stuff you can learn in a Logic 101 class if you want. Logic involves a lot of converting arguments into an algebra-like format to check if the arguments' structures \"balance\" like equations. Rationality means if the premises are true as stated, the conclusion must be true as stated. There are very few rational argument structures.)\n\nTwo other common fallacies related to what you did:\n\n* [Fallacy of composition](https://www.logicallyfallacious.com/logicalfallacies/Fallacy-of-Composition) = looking at specific examples within a group and drawing conclusions about the group as a whole\n* [Fallacy of division](https://www.logicallyfallacious.com/logicalfallacies/Fallacy-of-Division) = looking at a group as a whole and drawing conclusions about every specific example in that group\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>I don't really have an idea of what the greatest act of love is. In fact, personally I think it doesn't exist because everyone has a different relationship.\n\nCalling anything \"greatest\" (in the sense of \"best\", not \"largest\") is a value judgement. Value judgements are inherently and necessarily *subjective* (varying between individuals) not objective (universal).\n\n(Speaking as if a personal value judgement is necessarily shared by anyone else also requires reasoning errors like [mirror imaging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_traps_for_intelligence_analysis), but that's getting into [cognitive biases](https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-a-cognitive-bias-2794963).)\n\nSo *of course* \"the greatest act of love\" doesn't exist in an objective sense, but as I already pointed out, individual person can have their own subjective \"greatest act(s)\" for them.

This isn't an opinion; it's an objective evaluation of structure that you can learn more about in Logic 101 if you want.\n\nYou actually make the same error with the \"he meant aces may have libidos but we won't route it into the act of having sex.\" That's a false stereotype, and pretending it applies to all asexuals at best involves the converse error that I already mentioned. Asexuals experience a lack of *sexual attraction*; plenty of us have sex, whether or not we have libidos.\n\n(If you intended to make a generalization about many asexuals rather than a universal statement about all asexuals, you forgot an antecedent or determiner establishing that context; those are mandatory in English if you want to generalize; see 2 paragraphs down for elaboration on why.)\n\nIt's also not actually possible for what you claimed he said to mean what you're claiming he meant. If he did elaborate and it came out that was what he meant, he flunked some basics about communication that I'd expect a recently graduated psychotherapist to be well aware of and seeking to heed. This may be a side effect of your filtering, where you might've adjusted a phrasing to something you are perceiving as synonymous with what he said but that isn't actually synonymous.\n\nEnglish defaults to universal statements, defaulting to an implicit \"all\" when there's no determiner defined in context.

If evolution were \"[unproven](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/unproven)\", then that would mean there haven't been any tests or situations wherein it's been useful. That's false.\n\nEvolution (with some allowances for what a person means when they say that) is not *definitively* proven--and very few people actually claim it is. It's a scientific model, particularly when you look at the modern form and not the initial outdated hypothesis or some associated hypotheses that some creationists, out of ignorance or malice, falsely claim are what evolution is.\n\nYou might find it helpful to bother to learn what \"proof\", \"prove\", \"proven\", etc. actually mean; they're misunderstood in some creationist circles. It's my experience that even more misunderstand \"unproven\", \"disproved\", and \"debunked\" (which all mean different things).\n\nHint: \"Definitive proof\" is a specific *subtype* of proof; proof itself is just support for a position. To prove something is to *support* it, like I have done by citing specific examples and references through my comments. You've just gone the [*argumentum ad nauseum*](https://www.logicallyfallacious.com/logicalfallacies/Argument-by-Repetition) route.\n\nThis isn't rocket science; it's basic logic, the science of reasoning.
