Simply using and understanding 5 or 6 languages on a weekly basis (even in just an intermediate level) is already rare in many parts of the world. In some countries in Africa and in some regions of India, for example, it is pretty standard to know or speak 4 languages, but it\u2019s almost never the standard to know more than that.

Unless language learning is your sole hobby, you most likely won\u2019t do this. But it\u2019s still possible If you dedicate many years of your life\nThe best case scenario is that someone has naturally learned those languages due to family or external influences.

You will have to make some sacrifices and give up other things\n\nHowever, to answer your question, of course it\u2019s possible, but you have to take those things into account.

Intensive reading is when you read short texts, analyze the meaning, and try to understand every word. Extensive reading is reading long texts without a breakdown of comprehension and without needing to look up every word. The best reading method for language learning is extensive reading, because it exposes you to more of the language in a shorter amount of time. You should read at a level a bit above your current level, so that you learn new things but you're not overwhelmed. Also, definitely don't look up every word you don't understand. Try to use context clues. Basically only look up words if you can't understand an entire sentence, because if you look up every word that you don't understand, you will really slow down your learning. It is up to you if you want to write down a few words you didn't understand and review them later; I didn't do this much though. Also, if possible, try to listen to the audio as you read books.
