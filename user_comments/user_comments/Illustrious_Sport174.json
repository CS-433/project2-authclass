May I chime in?\n\nI would start by actually identifying and compiling a list of what they judge to be taking advantage. You say you are not dating THAT at all (taking advantage) but maybe you are doing something that you wouldn\u2019t consider taking advantage but they do. In a calm manner, ask them to please get specific BECAUSE you want to address their concerns and because you would value their support. \ud83d\ude03 If you don\u2019t value their support, simply ignore them and become numb to their criticism \ud83e\udd79\ud83d\ude05. \n\nEverybody\u2019s perspective and understanding is different. Attack the problem with love and grace. Maybe there\u2019s a lesson in it all\u2014 either for you, for them, or for all of you on how to more effectively communicate and to operate with respect and grace.\n\nOn another note, do you know your own love language? What about that of your girlfriend? This is just something to reflect on and not an accusation: what if\u2026 the way you demonstrate your love is not the way your partner receives/ feels/ recognizes love? Imagine someone feels loved when they are hugged and touched and then demonstrates their love by doing the same. Then imagine their partner does not feel loved when they are hugged. Maybe without even realizing it they are indifferent \ud83d\ude10 to touch because of a lack of abuse of affection in their past or for other reasons (physical, neurological, or personal). Imagine they feel loved when they receive words of affirmation. Imagine they feel loved when their partner shares the fruit of their labor by means of a very thoughtful thing given without the need of repayment (also known as a gift \ud83c\udf81\ud83e\udd23). \n\nThis may be overkill, but I will go ahead and supplement this long comment with the quick addressing of semantics. You said you treat her like a normal person. First of all, yikes at the language, but moving on. How do you define treating someone like a normal person? Are you saying you treat your partner as if they were normal or are you saying you treat them how any normal person would? Next, how do you treat a normal person? This wording is (unintentionally) vague. For example (albeit dramatic \ud83d\ude05), someone could slap their autistic partner and justify it by saying they were treating their partner like they would any other partner. Treating someone like a normal person does not imply that there are good boundaries in place. \n\nYou have a wonderful example of how you demonstrate your affection towards her by gifting her with her favorite snack. Is that within your budget? Do you ever feel resentment towards her or her family because you feel you make sacrifices that are not meant with reciprocation or acknowledgement? \n\nBe well!

Feel free to not continue reading as this gets very long and is not necessary, but just supplemental. \n\n\nLetting your light shine involves practicing Truth at all times. In Truth there is mercy. Forgive others so that you too may be forgiven. Forgiving has a lot to do with knowing the Truth\u2014 that is God\u2019s word. When I forgive someone that offends me, I acknowledge my hurt \ud83d\ude14 and I ask God for comfort. Then I address the situation with grace, remembering that the consequences for their behavior is not necessarily my response, but God\u2019s wrath if they acted in sin. Then I remember that there is time to use a kind word to turn away wrath, and also a rare time to flip tables. Ask God for wisdom and understanding, grace, discernment, examples, and courage\u2014 even the courage to use a kind word and/or silence; ask even for the courage to develop a thicker skin and a more humble spirit so that you may operate in your functional adult self that walks in their values and in step with the spirit, and not respond from the position of a victim who must avenge their human emotions. This maturity develops over time\u2014 living/ behaving and responding, then reflecting on the Word and re-evaluating our responses and applying what we\u2019ve learned to the next challenge. I am hurt and disgusted when I hear people being called derogatory words and I am hurt, disgusted, and angry when I hear blasphemy\u2014 I have to contain/ deny myself and respond with Truth and grace. I will say one time to someone who is trying to become a friend that \u201cI actually hate when people use the names of God as a curse or as a swear word.\u201d They will then typically insert some sort of defense here and I follow up with \u201cIt genuinely makes me uncomfortable when you do it around me.\u201d At this point I am setting a boundary. If they don\u2019t respect it I avoid being around them or entertaining them longer than I have to, but never losing my temper with them for ignoring this specific boundary violation as the problem lies in differences in knowledge and discipline, and the fight is against the forces in the air and with God and evil, not necessarily with me and this person, per se. If the person cares about me, whenever they blaspheme around me they tend to quickly apologize and move on which is acceptable to me. I offend God everyday and the conviction of His Word and assurance of His Mercy through the blood leads me to have a serious \ud83e\uddd0 reflection on my thoughts and behaviors and change my mind about permitting myself to engage in them in the future. This is repentance. \n\nLong answer, I know. Be blessed and continue to seek.
