But it is a very expensive and lengthy process to set up a commercial operation because the land must first be fenced off with 8ft tall game fencing, and the owner must clear the land of any wild game that will be the same as what they will be selling, by trapping and releasing it outside of the fencing. They have to pass several inspections by the parks and wildlife dept before they are given a permit to import and stock that land with their own game, and they have to submit to periodic inspections to make sure their herds are staying separate from the existing wild population.\n\nVenison is very popular here in Texas, and everyone has a friend with a freezer full of it if they don't hunt themselves, so with the exception of the sausage or a speciality butcher, you don't see it commonly in the grocery stores. But it is not uncommon to see it on the menu at some of the higher end restaurants.", "created_utc": "1663568880.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ip17u21", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_xhx4vj", "parent_id": "t3_xhx4vj", "score": "1", "subreddit": "Cooking", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh7f"}, {"author": "XandXor", "body": "Not sure if gezellig fits, if you are referring to the Dutch word.

To me almost every bottle of ink I have has a different smell, some mild and some very strong. There are very few that have almost no smell to me. Other people I know in the hobby cannot smell anything in their inks. So take any advice with that in mind.\n.....................\n\nA lot of inks have chemical smells. The reasons range from the aniline dyes that give the ink it's color, to the solvents the manufacturer uses to keep those dyes in suspension. There are also wetting agents that help keep the ink flowing to prevent hard starts; and finally, biocides that prevent molds from growing in your inks and ruining the whole bottle.\n\nEach manufacturer's formula is different, and even each color by that manufacturer is  different, due to the individual properties of the dyes necessary to achieve a particular hue.\n\nFinally, there are some inks out there that use more \"organic\" ingredients like oak gall's in iron gall ink, or squid ink in Noodler's Manjiro Nakahama Whaleman's Sepia ( I'm not sure if he actually uses squid ink in his formula or if it was just used in the old ink he used in his reference samples) that can add to the bouquet coming from the bottle.\n\nSo what you end up with is a unique chemical soup that will in some or even many cases have some \"interesting\" aromas.\n\nGood news is this is pretty normal, and unless your ink has floating islands of inky slime, or your nib comes out with an inky chunk attached after filling, your ink is safe to use. Age generally doesn't affect this (ask anyone out there hunting for a bottle of Parker Penman Saphire) though it is a good idea to be careful with an unknown vintage bottle. I have inks in my collection approaching 20+ years that still write as good as the day I bought them. \n\nIf either of those two things do happen to you ( it is not unheard of, it does happen every once in a while - read the archives of this subreddit if you are interested, just search for mold). Throw the ink out, and immediately deep clean any pens that are inked up with that bottle.\n\nAs an aside, the smell is most concentrated when you are filling it - it's one of the things that comes with our peculiar hobby. But once in the pen and the bottle is closed, that is the last time you will smell it. When writing, I have never noticed a bottle smell coming from the page, and once dry those smelly chemicals have all but evaporated from the paper.\n\nAlso, there are companies (De Atrementis and Jacques Herbin come to mind) who make inks with added fragrances that will make your journal smell like flowers to a fruit salad if you like.\n\nHope that helps!", "created_utc": "1659796316.0", "edited": "1659799454.0", "id": "ij6tumo", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_whn13c", "parent_id": "t3_whn13c", "score": "18", "subreddit": "fountainpens", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s0ew"}, {"author": "XandXor", "body": "One of us!

My neuropathy started at my toes and advanced quickly (1 week) up till it reached my chest, hands and forearms and now permanently affects my hands and my legs from the kneecaps down to my toes.\n\nTM is a rare \"unicorn\" disease, that is not well understood past it is an auto-immune disorder where the immune system goes after the nerve roots just outside the spinal column. The therapies generally revolve around supplementing and suppressing the immune system in the hopes that by quieting the immune system down, you can give the body a chance to heal the damage the immune system has caused.

The root cause for this is not known, beyond the immune system is malfunctioning for some reason.\n\nHe needs to go see a neurologist to help him get on some kind of immuno suppressant therapy (possibly) and he needs to get into neuro physical therapy as soon as possible (definitely).\n\nAs I have been told by my neuro, the damage from TM can be temporary at the onset (to varying degrees), but the longer you go without physical therapy the risks of the neuropathy becoming permanent increases dramatically. If there is a chance of regaining normal function, PT gives his body the best shot.\n\nAs for the hospital discharging him without diagnosis of loss of bowel and bladder control, that is surprising. That is a huge warning sign of spinal cord / nerve root issues and is (I have been told) an automatic, get thee to the hospital situation. He should probably be talking to a lawyer as well.\n\nOne last piece of advice.

The solution is to put raw copper in contact with the wine and allow the sulfur to off gas.\n\nI started with a copper wire suspended in the mead and that helped, but finally I got rid of it by sulfite'ing the mead and pouring it through a sanitized scotch brite pad in the bottom of a funnel. It was a last ditch effort and I risked oxidizing the mead (the sulfite is a bit of insurance against that), but you have to do it pretty quickly after you detect the sulfur because if you leave it in suspension for too long the sulfur converts to mercaptan. Once that happens there is nothing you can do to salvage the batch.\n\nMine turned out okay, but I should have known better it was getting too warm in the room I was fermenting in - it got up to around 78F.", "created_utc": "1630971891.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hbvakba", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_pj7hoy", "parent_id": "t1_hbv6373", "score": "3", "subreddit": "mead", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rcsz"}, {"author": "XandXor", "body": "I use premier rouge in an annual blueberry mead.

It is a pretty simple operation and allows you to save and put up purer samples to have on hand if your mother gets an infection.\n\nThe guy on the Doing the Most YouTube chanel has a quick 5 min tutorial on how to do this:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/E6e7cmLlcw0\n\nAlso, I second the other commenter that yeast nutrient is a very good precaution.

Love Savinelli's filters, the bulk of my collection are Sav's. The definitely help with the gurgle. So do the Dr. Grabow filters in corn cobs.\n\n2. Keep pipe cleaners with you when you smoke. When you start to feel the resistance that preceeds gurgling, run the pipe cleaner down the stem to stop up the excess moisture. Also, letting your tobacco dry a bit before packing and smoking a bowl helps as well.\n\n3. Toungue bite (for beginners) is partly smoking too fast and hot, but it is also a result of not being used to the tobacco and gets irritated. Slow down, and give your mouth a rest in between pipes (like a day or two at the beginning). Also get some Salivea mouth rinse, it will help your mouth and tongue heal from the irritation quicker. After a week or two you will find the bite goes away, partially because you will have figured out how to smoke slower and cooler and partially your tongue will adjust and not be a sensitive.\n\n4. I follow the manufacturer's guidelines, which for Savinelli is every 2-4 bowls (depending on how moist your tobacco choice is) and daily for corn cobs (usu 1-2 bowls, for me). I smoke 1-2 bowls a day typically and check the filter before I smoke. if it is a balsa filter, I know what an exhausted filter looks like and change based on that (I used to keep track with marks on a sheet, but know I know what to look for). Dr Grabow filters I just swap out when I am done with a pipe at the end of the day.\n\n5. Sort of. Sometimes I will smoke 2-3 bowls from the same pipe in a day. If I do this, I try to give the pipe at least an hour rest between bowls, and will put the pipe aside for 2-3 days after to rest and dry out after. The rule of thumb I was taught was 1 day of rest for each bowl smoked. This is for briar pipes because the briar wood needs time to absorb the leftover moisture in the bowl and heel. Corn cobs are different, as they are much quicker at absorbing the moisture and basically just need an hour or so to cool down.\n\n6. The hobby is as complex as you want it to be, just like cigars. It seems like a lot when you start out, new lingo, technique, sensations, keeping it lit etc. But it doesn't have to be. Best advice I can give you is find some basic tobacco like Carter Hall, Prince Albert, Velvet, Half and Half or Sir Walter Raleigh and only smoke that for a while. They are easy to pack, stay lit, don't gurgle badly and are pretty easy on the mouth and give you an opportunity to develop your process and rhythm, plus get used to your new pipes. Take your time and slow down, that is the most rewarding part of the hobby, slowing down and having that moment in time with the pipe. To borrow a saying from another favorite hobby (homebrewing)... Relax, don't worry and have a bowl!\n\nGood luck!", "created_utc": "1621419365.0", "edited": "False", "id": "gyoghvx", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_nfsgaq", "parent_id": "t3_nfsgaq", "score": "4", "subreddit": "PipeTobacco", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rbzz"}, {"author": "XandXor", "body": "My back porch...quiet and serene.

It now triples in volume in 4 hours and I keep it in the fridge until the day before I am going to be making dough. 12 hours before I am scheduled to start making dough, and I leave it out on the counter.\n\nI am using Basics with Babishes' sourdough recipe and mixing and folding schedule. No changes until the end. I dont have bannetons, so I fridge proof in metal 9\u00d75 loaf pans with all cotton dish towels as a couche. I flour the couche liberally with white rice flour and do not place the pans into freezer bags. I simply fold the excess towel on top and put them into the fridge.\n\nI leave them in the fridge for a minimum of 24 hours - 48 hours is better.\n\nI pull the loaves from the fridge and let them sit in the oven on the top rack with the light on for a minimum of 4 hours, and use the finger poke test to know when to start heating the oven.\n\nI have a convection oven and set it to 550F (the highest it will go) and let it heat for 1 hour with the dutch oven starting in the cold oven.\n\nFollow the rest of the Basics with Babbish instructions (bake for 20 mins at 550, pull the lid off, drop the temp to 450 and bake till brown).\n\nI really hope this helps someone struggling with sourdough.

So much of our lives are filled with digital interaction, and the typing that comes with it. When we sit down to write, whether it be a letter or card, some notes, journaling or whatever, it is more often than not an intentional act, so you should approach your handwriting the same way.\n\nSlow down and take your time. At first, it will seem a bit remedial, but by slowing down and focusing on how you are forming the letters you should see an improvement.\n\nYou can also supplement with one of the many handwriting improvement systems out there, but slowing down and being intentional is going to be every good system's first rule.\n\nAs your handwriting improves, you will gain speed. I still will get absent minded as I am taking notes while doing research and notice that my handwriting has been looking pretty janky. But that's okay because they are notes for me and I am the only person who needs to read it. However, my point is, my handwriting quality goes down when i am not focusing on the letters and words themselves, and being intentional. \n\nI hope this helps!

I didn't practice much but I enjoyed writing with fountain pens and preferred keeping written notes.\n\nLosing the ability to write was pretty devastating, as was the ability to use the keyboard effectively.\n\nAbout 4 months ago, my numbness began to slowly recede because of my treatments I am receiving and the first thing I wanted was to do was start writing again, but after 2 years of not really touching a pen, my skills had severely atrophied.\n\nSo I figured if I would have to learn how to write all over again, I would do it right this time and learn how to underwrite as a left hander.\n\nI started out using some American standard cursive worksheets from a free website, and then picked up the \"Write Now\" book by Getty and Dubay and began working through it.\n\nI try to practice now everyday, and spend about 30 mins to an hour on it. It has been wonderful therapy both physical as well as mental.\n\nIt is amazing how much more you appreciate something when you lose it.
