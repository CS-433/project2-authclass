Also, I didn\u2019t know about that section of the Harry Potter fandom so that was pretty interesting. \n\nHonestly, I relate to Shiro a lot because he had a crappy childhood (my headcanon which explains why he never talked about his family), found out he had a terminal illness (I don\u2019t have that, but I am disabled with a huge asterisk), but despite that still managed to become the youngest pilot at the Galaxy Garrison, practically adopted Keith (I have mentored a few kids in my past, it\u2019s honestly easier for me to talk with children and adults than people my own  age but I also just like seeing them grow. Mentoring is really rewarding), got tortured for a year (I don\u2019t have much to say on that other than I was abused), was made the black paladin just to fucking die for a year, come back, and then have that taken away from him. Oh and he lost his arm twice and his hair turned completely white. Also, he lost his only friend/boyfriend, Adam, when Earth was invaded (which he indirectly caused by releasing Sendack when they had him as prisoner. His brain gave him a hallucination or maybe that was the castle but I highly doubt it, that has to be a hallucination, which scared him into releasing him. Sendack came back and invaded Earth after like two years)\n\nBut despite that he still tried to be kind and still tried to be there for the paladins. Honestly, it\u2019s what I want, I\u2019ve been through a lot, I\u2019ve lost so much, but I want to try to be kind. I don\u2019t have the physical or mental strength to fight back, so it\u2019s sort of cathartic to see someone being able to. I think I have a similar personality to him, it\u2019s just he\u2019s stronger and can fight back. \n\nAlso, the literal creators of the show hated him. They tried their hardest to make Keith replace him but that\u2019s not how that works. They\u2019ve called him boring which is an insult I\u2019ve gotten a lot. And in show they\u2019ve made fun of him for being old. I\u2019ve been told I\u2019m either super young and pure (I\u2019m not) or that I\u2019m like a grandma (super serious, old, not fun) so that touched me on that one. \n\nAlso, he has not much backstory outside of that he\u2019s Japanese (enough to have his name be Japanese, I headcanon he lived in Japan until he was like 13, then came to the US to join the Galaxy Garrison), youngest pilot at the Galaxy Garrison, had a boyfriend Adam who broke up with him after Shiro said he\u2019d go on the Kerberos mission (because apparently he thought it was too dangerous. Fair, but this dude has a talent for nearly dying but not), mentored Keith, had a freaking terminal illness that wasn\u2019t explained for the majority of the show and only told out of canon that it was cured, then imprisoned by the Galra because why not. Obviously I have a lot of wiggle room for things I can DD about. \n\nI could go into my stuff, but I think my trauma is enough that if I was a character someone would accuse the author of making a Mary Sue or trauma dumping onto a character for no good reason. \n\nI like to daydream about him getting help for his PTSD (and other stuff). All anyone does to help me is either listen (not really helpful for things that need to change, you can\u2019t heal from something that\u2019s actively happening), or tell me to suck it up and not be a wimp because I can\u2019t be like that in the *real world*. So I\u2019m like, cool, and see Shiro getting hugs and stuff and just getting better. \n\nOf course I do that with a ton of variations, but I\u2019m a huge hurt/comfort fan.

Unfortunately I really latched onto him so he\u2019s still my go to, but I am trying to at least shift it to my own OC\u2019s that I can control. But it\u2019s still hard since he was fucked over in a uniquely twisted way that kinda reflects my own stuff (my stuff is no where as severe as his was, but I don\u2019t think that matters) that it feels like he\u2019s the character I can relate to the most.

That\u2019s why I don\u2019t have main characters with certain struggles, just because, I don\u2019t know enough about the subject to do it justice. \n\nThen these shows for literal children is like, hm, want to humanize a dictator who killed and tortured billions?

Honestly, a lot of people just include disabled people as a way to have a diverse cast without really looking into it.

It\u2019s like the awkwardness you experience in middle school, but it doesn\u2019t go away and when you\u2019re in middle school it\u2019s like that but on steroids. Also, a struggle I face is being blunt, sometimes I make an observation and I don\u2019t mean it to be insulting, but they take it that way. Oh and also, you know that pain you get when the music is too loud, you turn on your screen too bright, etc. well that\u2019s basically SPD except we get it for smaller things. I went to the eye doctor and when they were taking pictures of my eyes the light hurt, then my sister told me that it didn\u2019t hurt her and it wasn\u2019t that bad and I was like, great, that means you don\u2019t have photophobia\u2026 \n\nOh also, routines are important because if we don\u2019t have things like a morning ritual and stuff, things get confusing and overwhelming quick. It\u2019s like accidentally going to a different town and you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re supposed to do, except with everyday stuff. Like if someone sits at my spot at the dinner table I get confused because where am I supposed to sit? That\u2019s my spot. Everyone knows that\u2019s my spot. Or before school I need to brush my teeth while my breakfast is being made, but someone is in the bathroom, 20 minutes later they\u2019re still in the bathroom. I can\u2019t eat until I brush my teeth. \n\nOh, also frustration at least for me is a cause for meltdowns. Like when I\u2019m doing something and I just don\u2019t know what I\u2019m supposed to do, it makes things really overwhelming because I have to do the thing, but I don\u2019t know how. Nothing is worse than this happening at school and you have your hand raised for like 10 minutes, but by the time your teacher comes by you\u2019re already crying and can\u2019t really talk, then they get mad that you aren\u2019t telling them what\u2019s wrong but you just can\u2019t speak because of how overwhelmed you are.
