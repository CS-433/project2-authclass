Think of a bell curve--there are rarer outcomes at the edges of the bell curve, but they're still normal, still part of what you'd expect to see.

It's a bit of a semantic debate, and I'm not sure how much we get out of it, but there it is--in my opinion intersex people are normal and natural, because although we're unusual, we've always been around and we're exactly what you'd expect to see if you consider humans as a population which is going to have variation. When people are talking about intersex people and want to emphasize that we're uncommon, I prefer to hear just that--uncommon, unusual, atypical (maybe rare, but rare sounds a little extreme for me--by some estimates 2% of people are intersex, so it's not exactly rare).

I know tons of people with conditions like this one who are super healthy and have amazing lives.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nIt sounds like this child would have Swyer Syndrome, also known as XY Gonadal Dysgenesis. This is what I have. I've written below about my experience, but until you know for sure what condition your fetus has, you should consider this only one possibility.\n\nBasically, without the SRY gene to trigger development of the testes, the protogonads (which typically become testes in male fetuses, ovaries in female fetuses) would stay protogonads. In the absence of masculinizing androgens (like testosterone) which come from the testes, the fetus would from that point on develop female primary sex characteristics, including a vulva, vagina, cervix, and uterus. They would only lack ovaries, having instead protogonads. (Female development is kind of the \"default\" for fetuses, there are a few different steps to make a male fetus, and if anything goes wrong, it reverts to female development. This is what happens when it's the SRY step that goes wrong.)\n\nTo answer your questions:\n\n1. Properly treated Swyer Syndrome does not make people any more or less likely to have a low sex drive.\n2. The baby would look just like a typical baby girl. Without this kind of genetic test, you would have no way of knowing the child had any kind of genetic condition--and most parents and kids don't, until the child gets older and fails to start puberty. (You may see online that people with Swyer Syndrome tend to be taller than average, but that's because they aren't usually diagnosed and don't start hormone replacement therapy until later in life, which means that their puberty growth spurt is added onto more years' worth of pre-pubescent growth. That wouldn't be an issue for your child, because you already know about the condition and would start treatment at the right time, so your child's height wouldn't be affected by the condition.)\n3. Hormone replacement therapy should start approximately when children start puberty (they use bone age tests, X-rays of the wrist to see how many bones have fused together, to ensure that a child has reached an appropriate level of skeletal development before starting them on HRT). People with this condition typically stay on hormone replacement therapy until late middle age (when menopause would start). It's important to be on HRT in order to develop physically and stay healthy, particularly for uterine health and to maintain bone density. People usually figure out what they need for HRT with their doctor, as it can vary from person to person. People with Swyer Syndrome need estrogen and progesterone (transwomen and most intersex women only need estrogen because they don't have uteruses, but women with Swyer Syndrome need progesterone to ensure proper uterine development and avoid fibroids). I do well on standard birth control, which contains both estrogen and progesterone and is obviously very convenient and widely available, but other people do better on estrogen creams or patches and separate progesterone pills. Regardless--not an issue until at least age 10-12.\n4. With correct care, the child would be able to have periods and her organs would develop correctly. I have had ultrasounds a few times to confirm that my uterus has developed properly and reached the correct size--and it has--so doctors would probably want to do that before and after puberty to make sure that everything was growing properly, but there's no reason it shouldn't. She would not have ovaries, and so could not have children without an egg donor. I personally know two women with my condition who have successfully carried pregnancies using egg donors, so it is possible. By the time your child would be thinking about having children, there might be even more options, including the possibility of creating ova with her own genetic material so that she could not only carry a child in her uterus but genetically be its mother. (This isn't currently possible, but it's a topic of research, so who knows about the future?) Infertility can be emotional for many people, but I've known I was infertile since I was a toddler, so it doesn't bother me as much as it might if I'd grown up always assuming I could have kids.\n\nI do have to mention one other thing which might sound scary, but which I promise isn't a big deal. The undifferentiated protogonads that the child would have instead of ovaries do have some risk of becoming cancerous. Because they carry this risk and they don't perform any useful function, they're usually removed. Many intersex people are against medically-unnecessary surgeries to make us \"normal\" but this one is necessary. And it's totally simple! My protogonads were removed when I was three years old (the cancer risk is really pretty low, so they didn't think it was worth putting me under anesthetic as an infant). It was a laparoscopic (keyhole, tiny incision) surgery, so I don't remember it hurting at all, and I just have tiny 1 cm incisions on either side of my navel. And that was a quarter of a century ago, so I'm sure it's even better/easier now. I understand that hearing cancer/surgery must freak out an expecting parent, but I PROMISE you, the only way this becomes an issue is for people who don't realize they have Swyer Syndrome until they're older--you already know, so your kid would just need one really minor surgery and then there'd be no increased cancer risk.\n\nAnyway, that is MORE than enough information, and I hope you're not overwhelmed. In a few weeks/months, I encourage you to join some of the facebook groups for families of intersex kids, or even for Swyer Syndrome specifically if you find out that's what your child has. There's also [aisdsd.org](https://aisdsd.org) which is a great resource for intersex people and their families.

It sounds like the gig work that Instacart offers is actual gig work, not a full time job masquerading as gig work. It sucks that it's the best option for a lot of people right now, but if the job market were better, wouldn't the answer be, \"If you want to be guaranteed a full day's work and a full day's pay every day, gig work isn't for you--this work is flexible and irregular, which has advantages and disadvantages, and isn't meant to substitute for a full time job.\"\n\nI know people are suffering, so I feel like an asshole, but it just doesn't seem like it's Instacart's job to only hire just enough shoppers to handle the available orders.

For example, with my condition, I have XY chromosomes, typically female primary sex characteristics, and no gonads. Without artificial hormones I would have no sex hormones and no secondary sex characteristics. I don't think you can reasonably call that \"in-between\" male and female--really, it's not either male or female.\n\nYou can also think of complete androgen insensitivity syndrome. People with CAIS are born with undescended testes that produce testosterone, but their bodies are insensitive to testosterone, so it converts into estrogen. Because they have plenty of estrogen even without HRT and their bodies don't react to testosterone at all, you can almost say that they're \"more female than female\"--they don't have certain traits caused by testosterone, like body hair, acne, and body odor. They're intersex, and they have typically male gonads, but in terms of their hormones they have relatively high levels of both estrogen and testosterone, and in terms of their secondary sex characteristics, they'd be past female in the other direction on the spectrum.\n\nThere are many more examples. Suffice it to say that sex isn't a continuum with male and female being points at either end and intersex people falling in between. Sex has many different components (chromosomal sex, gonadal sex, primary sex characteristics, hormonal sex, and secondary sex characteristics, to start with) and people can be intersex by having any combination of different sex characteristics that doesn't line up with what's typically thought of as male or female--that can mean having characteristics that are both male and female, or neither male or female, or yes, in between.

It will be less expensive and more convenient for work to live in the village, and as long as you have some way to get out for weekends and breaks, it shouldn't be a problem. BlaBlaCar is a great service--I used it all the time to get around France from my small town because the train often required many connections. Many of the listed trips are across the country, but I regularly saw thirty minute to one hour trips also listed, and people were usually okay with stopping in my smaller town to pick me up or drop me off, as long as it wasn't too far out of the way.\n\nTL;DR, I understand your dilemma and would totally understand if you decided you had to have a car, but based on my experience I think you'll probably have a better time of it if you live in your village and use BlaBlaCar and taxis to get out when you need to.", "created_utc": "1561665502.0", "edited": "False", "id": "es77tp4", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_c67sn8", "parent_id": "t3_c67sn8", "score": "1", "subreddit": "tapif", "subreddit_id": "t5_2zspb"}, {"author": "EpiceEmilie", "body": "PETA sucks for so many reasons, but they do have a reason for killing so many of the animals in their shelters.

What are \"fully functioning intersex characteristics\"? Intersex bodies function in a lot of different ways, and there's no one standard way they should function. That phrase is meaningless. Intersex refers to so many types of bodies, how can you say that you want to have intersex characteristics when that's so non-specific? Based on what you said in the first part of your post, it sounds like you were implying that intersex people have complete sets of both typically \"male\" and typically \"female\" genitalia, which is a harmful myth.\n\nEven if you were \"using appropriate nomenclature ... from a scientific standpoint\" (which you weren't), that wouldn't automatically make it okay. Queer people, particularly trans and intersex people, have often been victims of a scientific community that was 100% sure that it was correctly identifying things and using the right words and providing correct medical treatment when it was actually doing vast amounts of harm. Don't hide behind your incorrect grasp of the biology of intersex conditions to try to prove that what you said was acceptable. If you're not intersex, it's not your place to tell intersex people what the word means and how it can be used.\n\nThe provocation was your misuse of the word intersex. I didn't accuse you of fetishizing yourself, I pointed out that you are misrepresenting and fetishizing intersex people. I did it in a friendly way, saying please and being cheerful, using no profanity--I didn't do anything to compromise this \"safe, lighthearted part of the internet\". I specifically didn't write a long, angry screed the first time around. I was trying to be nice because I assumed you were a good person who would just need to be told once to stop. If you think I did something wrong by simply telling you that what you did is harmful, then clearly you don't care about this being a safe part of the internet for intersex people, which is pretty telling. Don't talk about intersex people unless you're actually willing to engage with us, support us, and learn about what our lives are like. Don't tell me that I can't kindly correct you when you make a mistake because you know more about what it means to be intersex and the oppression we face than I do. Listen to us when we tell you that the things you do hurt us.\n\nThis should be a safe and friendly part of the internet, so I'm choosing to believe that you're a good person who will someday realize that you made a mistake and will want to learn more.

It's not a program designed to make you feel like you're making a difference, or like you're an invaluable part of students' English-learning experience. What you get out of it is your visa; your paycheck; your free healthcare; your massive amounts of free time during the week; your opportunities to learn French; your eight weeks of paid vacation over the course of seven months (!!!); sometimes, as in my case, your housing. That's more than enough! You're an adult doing a job and \"Constant reassurance of your value, constant opportunities to do work that meets your ultra-specific criteria of being 'meaningful'\" is not one of the benefits of the job. There are plenty of other benefits.\n\nIdeally, you can even look at TAPIF as an opportunity to get used to this kind of work, because that's what it's like in most jobs. Hopefully you're doing work that you care about, but people aren't going to constantly thank you and reassure you and put your contributions into perspective to demonstrate how crucial you are to the organization's mission. Remember in Mad Men when Peggy cries, \"But you never say thank you!\" and Don replies, [\"THAT'S WHAT THE MONEY'S FOR!!!\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77Y6CIyyBcI)? Yeah.\n\nI don't want to seem surly or condescending, and I certainly don't want to come across as criticizing across a generational divide--I'm 26, solidly a millennial, did TAPIF two years ago (2016-2017), identify with a lot of the self-descriptors this author used in their article, and I've definitely felt similar things in the past when I've had jobs where I expected other people to motivate me rather than motivating myself. My point isn't that this author is wrong, or that anyone feeling things similar to this author is wrong, my point is just that I see this as less a meaningful critique of TAPIF and more an observation about the adult world. In school it's your teacher's job to make you care about stuff. In a professional environment, it's assumed that the pay and benefits they're providing are enough to make you make yourself care.\n\nI empathize with this person's frustration, particularly with people not showing up (that rarely happened during my time in TAPIF, but believe me, I know what that's like from being a Peace Corps volunteer). For me, experiences like this have just emphasized how important it is that I do things that I actually enjoy doing and find meaningful for myself, rather than doing things with the expectation of external validation. At the risk of sounding too hippy-dippy, living in the moment is very important, and a big part of that is finding work to do that you are happy to have done even if no one notices.

Intersex is about sex, so using it as a counter argument against there only being two genders is a little weird to me--gender and sex are two different things, so... It's not that it's completely unacceptable, it's just that it can leave people with a misunderstanding of what intersex means and what issues are important to intersex people.\n\nThe average person can help by learning more about intersex people and sharing information. In particular, I think that it's good to share information about intersex conditions with couples that are trying to conceive or expectant parents--you have to do it with sensitivity, and for most people it won't be relevant, but I really think that talking about the possibility of having an intersex kid BEFORE it happens can help people deal with it in a much better way.\n\nYou can also make sure that LGBTQ organizations you're a part of advertise that you're open to intersex people (if that's the case). You can call your representatives to encourage them to condemn intersex surgeries, as [California's state legislature recently did](https://www.hrw.org/news/2018/08/28/california-resolution-affirms-intersex-rights). You can donate money to intersex organizations, like [InterACT](https://interactadvocates.org/). You can teach your kids the basics about intersex conditions when you teach them about sex ed more generally, or encourage your kid's school to do so. You can call people out when they make jokes about small penises or micropenises (either just saying that they look funny or conflating penis size and morality) because the idea that people with small penises can't possibly be good people, be socialized normally, and live happy lives is a big part of why doctors often feel justified in intervening surgically to \"normalize\" intersex kids. (And those jokes can really hurt the feelings of intersex children and adults who didn't suffer through unnecessary surgeries but do have micropenises, and guess what, that's fine, it's not a punchline, it's just a different and perfectly valid and wonderful kind of body to have!)\n\nIt doesn't have to be a major thing like writing an op-ed in a newspaper or starting fundraising drive for an intersex organization. There are lots of little ways that you can further educate yourself and the people around you--and if you're doing that, great! Feel free to talk about intersex people! It's just that most of the people I've known IRL who bring up intersex people to make a point about how trans people are treated ONLY talk about intersex people in that way. And that's not enough. If you're going to talk about us at all, try to at least include us in broader queer communities and stay away from the kind of rhetoric and jokes that make us seem like a talking point or a punchline instead of a group of people who actually exist and need representation and resources at least as much as anyone else in the queer community! (I will note that not all intersex people consider themselves to be LGBTQ or queer, so it's important not to act like intersex=queer, but many intersex people do consider themselves queer, either because they're intersex or because of their other identities, so it's good to make space for intersex people in LGBTQ communities and organizations without implying that all intersex people belong there.)", "created_utc": "1536009370.0", "edited": "False", "id": "e5c9phm", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_9cl7z6", "parent_id": "t1_e5c8a67", "score": "9", "subreddit": "ainbow", "subreddit_id": "t5_2tcpq"}, {"author": "EpiceEmilie", "body": "Go ahead, I guess.", "created_utc": "1536007853.0", "edited": "False", "id": "e5c82oq", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_9cl7z6", "parent_id": "t1_e5bzm1k", "score": "3", "subreddit": "ainbow", "subreddit_id": "t5_2tcpq"}, {"author": "EpiceEmilie", "body": "Yeah, where is this magical universe where intersex people are somehow free from pressure to identify with the binary gender they're assigned at birth?

I knew two volunteers out of my fifty person training group who told me that they were on antidepressants. I don't know how many others were also on antidepressants and didn't volunteer the information. You can definitely serve in the Peace Corps and be on antidepressants at the same time.\n\nThat said, the Peace Corps wants to know that you're stable on your current treatment, which usually involves having a documented history of having been on medication for a few years with no problems and no changes. If you think your situation has improved and you'd be considering stopping your meds anyway, great--but if you're doing it for the Peace Corps, that could be counterproductive, particularly if you end up going on and off meds a few times. That would suggest that you require a level of mental health care monitoring and treatment that some countries couldn't provide. On the other hand, if you stay on your meds with consistent good results, the Peace Corps med people might be more likely to think that you're someone who will only require your medication and maybe access to counseling/therapy services by video (which all volunteers can request).\n\nBasically I would say that one of the main things that Peace Corps medical staff want to know is that you're going to prioritize taking care of yourself and ask for help when you need it. For now, don't think about what the Peace Corps would want--just practice asking for what you need and taking care of yourself. Long-term, that's going to demonstrate the kind of responsibility that will make you an attractive, low-risk candidate for medical clearance.", "created_utc": "1528894627.0", "edited": "False", "id": "e0ljlfk", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_8qrakg", "parent_id": "t3_8qrakg", "score": "8", "subreddit": "peacecorps", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rh24"}, {"author": "EpiceEmilie", "body": "You seem dubious that being a Peace Corps volunteer would be a significantly different/more useful experience than being an English teaching assistant. I've done both (PCV Cameroon 2014-2016, ETA France 2016-2017) and the two experiences are very different.\n\nFirst of all, as a Peace Corps volunteer, you use way more skills than you do as a teaching assistant--cultural skills, professional skills, etc. You also have much more long term goals, and while most volunteers leave having made only incremental progress on those goals, you do stay long enough to see some progress. I found that being in the Peace Corps was much more interesting as a cultural experience, made me feel more like I was really becoming part of a new community, and forced me to become much more self-reliant than being an English teaching assistant.\n\nSo I think that they're two very distinct experiences, and just because you don't think that continuing to be an English teaching assistant is the answer to your dilemma, doesn't mean that the Peace Corps isn't. It also doesn't mean that the Peace Corps is.\n\nI encourage you to really think about why you want to be a Peace Corps volunteer. Absolutely part of your reason can be to travel, learn languages, and give yourself time and perspective to figure out what you really want to do long term--those were huge reasons that I joined the Peace Corps, and they really paid off for me. But the Peace Corps isn't a cultural exchange program, as my country director was so fond of reminding us. You have to focus on goal one. Do you have the skills to serve a community as a Peace Corps volunteer in one of the sectors? If not, are you committed to learning those language, technical, and cultural skills--and developing those skills beyond just the bare minimum to get through training? Are you prepared to give up opportunities to travel or meet up with other Americans because your work in your community is more important? Are you prepared to work with people you don't like, or at least don't understand, if it's necessary for your work to succeed?\n\nI hope that this doesn't come across as judgmental, because I'm very sympathetic to your situation and think that the way that you're thinking about the Peace Corps is very common. I'd just encourage you to give a lot of thought about what you're prepared to contribute in terms of time and effort and commitment. If you're viewing the Peace Corps purely as a way to travel and put off hard decisions, neither you nor the community where you serve will get anything out of you being there. But if those are only part of your reasoning for wanting to be a Peace Corps volunteer, you might get a lot out of signing up for two years of service.\n\nPersonally, I hope you think about it and do end up being a PCV. My two years were some of the hardest and most fun of my life, and I left the Peace Corps with more skills, friends, independence, and motivation than I came with. But the big determiner about what you'll get out of the Peace Corps isn't anything about the Peace Corps itself (well, as long as things are functioning as they should)--it's how you approach it.\n\nETA--One of my closest friends in the Peace Corps had been a volunteer in Ukraine before being evacuated in 2014, and I think that he'd echo this for Ukraine. It might be geographically close to where you've lived before, but it's still a new language and new culture, and I'm told that they often use Peace Corps volunteers to staff teaching posts where other teachers don't want to go, so you might be surprised by what a small, isolated town you end up in. It's also different because education volunteers are expected to complete other projects on top of teaching--my friend was just getting his main project, a journalism club, off the ground when he was evacuated. This contributes to a greater feeling of responsibility and investment than you get when you're a teaching assistant.

I'm thinking of doing a series of equilateral triangles by drawing lines in chalk every ~2 5/8\" from the edge of the quilt, and then knotting every three inches along the first line, then along the second line in between where I knotted along the first line, and so on.  But because my quilt panels are all rectangles, this means that the places where the yarn shows through on the other side (I've seen people recommend both embroidery floss and yarn, is yarn okay?  I knit, so I already have a lot of that.) won't have any relationship to the quilt panels.  But it's already a casual T-shirt quilt, with rectangles of varying lengths (and widths, to a lesser extent).  So would that look okay, or should I figure out some way of placing the knots somewhere that's consistent relative to the quilt panels?\n\nRelated question:  on what side should I actually tie the knots?  On the back, so that there's less to distract from the T-shirt designs on the front, or on the front as an additional design element?\n\nI know that a tied quilt technically isn't a quilt, but I figure someone here must have the answer to my questions.

I had just taken my first vacation from the Peace Corps, spent two weeks in the U.S. visiting family and friends and not being called \"whiteman!\", \"la blanche\", and \"nasarra\" every time I walked down the road.  I was back in Cameroon, at a bus depot in Douala.  (I think it was bonapriso or something?  Across the bridge to the north, where buses leave for Bamenda.  But I'm already starting to forget place names.)  I had gotten there almost before the sun rose hoping to leave early, but it had already been three hours and the bus I was on wasn't even halfway full.  Frustrated, I left to go to the bathroom.\n\nOn my way to the bathroom, this guy halfway across the parking lot yelled at me, loudly and obnoxiously, \"Hello!  Hello!  Hello!\"  This wasn't really anything unusual--Cameroonians are fairly cosmopolitan, especially those in large cities, so it's not like they've never seen a white person before, but they may not have ever had the opportunity to talk to a white person face-to-face.  Some people get overly excited and try to get your attention, some see you as an interesting thing that's happening, rather than a person.  In any case, many Cameroonians feel very entitled to your time and attention.  Usually I would just ignore it or acknowledge it in a very minimal way (brief nod), but this time, after spending two weeks without this constant harassment, I couldn't bring myself to react as I knew I should.\n\nInstead, I turned towards the man who'd yelled at me and, from across the parking lot, shouted as angrily as I could, with my face all distorted, \"HI!  HI!  HI!\"  (I know, not the greatest comeback ever.)  I hoped that that would end things, but I should have known better.  Never in my wildest dreams could I have predicted what would happen next, however, as I continued on my way to the bathroom.\n\nAs the man who'd yelled at me, and three or four of his friends, realized that I was heading to the bathroom, they all started up a chant, stilted at first until they got a rhythm together:  \"WHITE WOMEN DON'T SHIT!  WHITE WOMEN DON'T SHIT!  WHITE WOMEN DON'T SHIT!\"  It was the weirdest, most annoying, most nonsensical thing anyone has ever said to me, and they kept it up the entire time I walked to the bathroom, and even as I paid the attendant my 50 CFA and received three squares of toilet paper in return.

Like, socks or mittens are the smallest, then hats, then scarves, then sweaters (there are lots of other projects, but that's what I see as being most common).  The shaping for scarves is simplest, which I think is why so many people tackle them as their first project, but honestly I think that they take so long, especially if you aren't a very fast knitter yet, that it's better to do something like a potholder, or even an easy hat, so that you don't lose motivation and set the project aside for months.  That's what I did with my first project, which was a scarf--I, and I think a lot of knitters, have a bad habit of leaving lots of unfinished projects on the needles for years.

I actually just saw a post in another subreddit where intersex conditions were brought up as a way to contradict the idea that the gender binary has a biological basis without actually mentioning the word \"intersex\" or seeming to care about the issues that affect intersex people.  It actually really bothered me because they said, \"You can have X and Y chromosomes but still be a woman because the Y chromosome is missing the SRY gene\" (paraphrasing slightly) and that REALLY annoyed me because I have that condition (Swyer Syndrome) and I'm NOT a woman, I'm non-binary--it's just a really fucked up way of using my condition to contradict gender essentialism but then also erasing my identity by implying that all people with my condition identify as women.  And I don't disagree with the main point being made, but it's SO FUCKING FRUSTRATING that people can't find ways to make that point without using intersex people and conditions.  And using intersex people and conditions in a way that's devoid of all context and doesn't actually center intersex people and the issues that face us.\n\nSpeaking out when people use intersex conditions that way is a good start.  You can point out the inaccuracies in the \"sex is binary so gender is binary\" argument in a way that puts emphasis on intersex people and the ways in which an enforced sex binary harms them, not just on trans people and the ways in which an enforced gender binary harms them.  At the very least, the word intersex should be used when talking about intersex people (or \"people with differences of sex development\", if in a specifically medical context).\n\nA few other ideas:\n * Discourage trans non-binary people who are not intersex from appropriating terms like intersex or hermaphrodite (discourage anyone who is not intersex from using the term hermaphrodite in any context [aside from describing non-human organisms which are actually hermaphroditic according to the word's current scientific meaning, obviously], as some intersex people see it as a harmful slur which only intersex people are in a position to reclaim).\n * Contribute to the creation of shared spaces for trans and intersex people to enter into discussion.  Keep in mind that, in such spaces, overly detailed or celebratory discussion of the process of medically transitioning can be troubling for some intersex people who were forced to transition against their will.  (I understand how awesome and validating it can be for trans people to celebrate their transition and the concrete evidence of their medical autonomy, which is so often denied, but when posts like this dominate the conversation in a group that's ostensibly for both trans and intersex people, it can be very alienating.)\n * If you're someone with a social media platform, consider following and occasionally retweeting/rewhatevering posts from intersex activists (Inter|Act Youth Advocates is a good place to start).\n * If you're part of a trans group, either online or irl, and the group is open to intersex members, consider ways of making that more explicit (I've often noticed, if I join a trans group to discuss enby issues and I later bring up the fact that I'm intersex, people are really happy to hear that perspective and wish that the group had more intersex members--but they don't make it clear that they welcome intersex members in the first place).\n * Keep in mind that most intersex people are not trans and many don't consider themselves part of the LGBTQ+ community at all.  I think most intersex people recognize our connection to the community and the ways we benefit from work that LGBTQ+ activists, particularly trans activists, have been doing for decades, but some people aren't comfortable claiming that as part of their identity--and that's fine!  As important as it is to be inclusive, it's also important not to assume that just because someone's intersex mean's they're non-binary or that they're obligated to be a rainbow flag waving activist--it's awesome if they are, but they shouldn't feel like they have to be.\n\nBut I think the trans community is pretty awesome in general.  Intersex and trans people come up against a lot of the same preconceived notions in our society, and the work that one group does will usually benefit the other group either directly or indirectly.", "created_utc": "1488577034.0", "edited": "False", "id": "deh52rf", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_5xbuy1", "parent_id": "t3_5xbuy1", "score": "17", "subreddit": "intersex", "subreddit_id": "t5_2sgqq"}, {"author": "EpiceEmilie", "body": "Thanks for the input!

I'm low-key fascinated by this stuff, I even put together a google doc a while back about my five factors ratings and how I'd like to change them, if possible.\n\nTo address your inquiry, I don't prefer MBTI to the five factors model, in fact, I strongly prefer the five factors model.  The MBTI is widely discredited in academic circles--this isn't to say that it's completely useless, but that the results it generates are subjective, can change over time, don't map in useful ways to clinical diagnoses.  Basically, from the perspective of someone trying to better understand how they interact with the world as an individual, MBTI is great, but as a psychologist or social scientist trying to understand and characterize and make useful and insightful generalizations or observations about populations of people, the five factors model of understanding personality is far superior.\n\nWhat really interests me is that it's possible to get a genuinely unflattering result on the five factors model--I, for example, am low in agreeableness and high in neuroticism.  We all know someone who has an objectively awful personality (speaking figuratively here because personality is obviously always subjective), so I think that if a personality test can't return a \"bad\" result (MBTI doesn't have one type that's \"The Loser\" or anything like that) it's limiting its scope.  The fact that the five factors model is willing to measure and return results that are just not good might be part of why it's more useful for researchers.  I've taken it myself, several times, and as someone who wants to be a diplomat someday (God help me) it's helped me acknowledge that I need to learn ways to come across as more agreeable.\n\nBut the MBTI is more useful on an individual level because it provides more direction on how to productively interact with the world around you.  The five factors model is great for researchers because its scope is perhaps more limited and its results are more frank, but if you're an individual person looking at your personality test results and thinking, \"Shit, am I really that disagreeable?  Do people hate me?\" then the insights provided by the MBTI test and by talking to other people of your type are more helpful in moving forward and understanding why you might come across a certain way and how to improve your interactions with people in the future.\n\nI've been interested in both of these personality models for a while but I've kind of been thinking this out as a write it, sorry.  Basically I would say that the five factors model is indeed a big picture model which is interested in describing purportedly immutable aspects of personality in broad strokes in a way which is useful to researchers and clinicians, whereas the MBTI model is more subjective and more limited in scope but more useful to individuals because of its focus on strengths, on how people interact with the world around them rather than on everything about them, and on how to use knowledge of your strengths and weaknesses and preferred ways of interacting with other people.  You could almost say that the five factors model describes something and that's that whereas the MBTI model is more growth-focused with an emphasis on stages of development and working with your natural tendencies to learn how to interact more positively with the world around you.\n\nBut I am not in any way an expert so I could just be talking out of my ass here.

I find clothes super interesting here--both in terms of having clothes tailor-made in traditional or other printed fabrics, and having such a wide variety of clothes in so many different styles inexpensively available at the frip.  It seems like there are so many fewer people who disappear into \"jeans and a t shirt\" or other \"default\" outfits and styles--way more people put an effort into cultivating a personal aesthetic.  And I love seeing clothes worn outside of the context that the manufacturer intended--for example, a pink, bedazzled sweater intended for a teenaged girl being worn by a macho bike man.  It just seems like there's a lot less built into the production and distribution of clothes to suggest to people what they should be wearing (aside from concerns of modesty), so you see so many more interesting and diverse styles.  That's definitely a generalization, but I'd say it more or less holds true in my limited experience.\n\nBut the point of that was just to say that I'm fascinated by West African clothes and the extent to which/how people here think about cultivating a personal style, but I've only ever been to Cameroon, so I'm wondering how your experience differs. :)", "created_utc": "1464814660.0", "edited": "False", "id": "d3s8mk1", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_4m15dc", "parent_id": "t1_d3s4wmp", "score": "7", "subreddit": "femalefashionadvice", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s8o5"}, {"author": "EpiceEmilie", "body": "I don't, unfortunately.  :/  I know there are some etsy shops that might interest you, but my internet is really slow right now, so I can't give you any specific links.

I'm not an expert (obviously), but when I visited the palace at Bafut, they showed me a particularly spectactular example and explained that the different shapes represent different structures--in that case, it was actually a map of the palace's layout, with different symbols representing the chief's house, his wives houses, a house where a set of twins lives, etc., etc.  I've never seen the fabric that's woven in the traditional way used in clothing, only as a wall hanging, but there are lots of printed reproductions that people use in traditional outfits for cultural events.\n\nThe other one, black with embroidery in bright colors, is very common in the Northwest.  I don't know if it's associated with a particular ethnic group or if it has a technical name;  everyone here just calls it \"country dress\", the same way that the local dialect is \"country talk\".  It's probably considered the most formal thing you can wear (it's difficult to compare because Western clothes like suits are also considered formal, but kind of on a different axis), so people only break it out for very formal, traditional events, like big funerals (\"cry dies\") and the annual cultural and development association festival, things like that.  The shapes and patterns embroidered on the cloth have particular meanings.  I don't know all of the meanings, but for example, if you see two triangles side by side connected at their top points by a u-shape, that represents an ngong, a traditional percussive instrument (two iron bells connected by a u-shaped piece of rebar), and someone with that shape on their country dress is a member of the local chief's family.  Only the chief and his wives have cowrie shells sewn into their country dress.  Again, etc., etc.  There are way more meanings than I can remember, and I'm sure they vary by where you are in the Northwest.\n\nSo I know other Westerners who've been invited to wear traditional clothes made out of these fabrics, but you can see how this is a situation where, if clothes can be said to talk, these clothes are loudly shouting very specific messages, and without having a local friend to tell you the cultural significance behind what you're wearing, you could very easily commit a faux pas.  And no Northwestern Cameroonian would wear clothes in these fabrics outside of very specific cultural contexts (to the best of my knowledge), so it doesn't make sense for anyone else to either.  Whereas other fabrics, which might be designed to look vaguely West African (or might not) but don't invoke patterns with specific cultural meanings are sort of fair game, as long as you take the time to make sure that they aren't culturally appropriative.

(Even if a few things about his argument are strange, I know that wouldn't entirely discredit what he's saying, but still.)

Maybe that's inevitable for this kind of discussion, and he did provide lots of links to related articles and quotes from people experiencing the same kind of thing.

Did I miss something or forget something where he provided more concrete evidence that this is actually happening?  Or justified why his emotional perceptions of feeling attacked or oppressed should be considered more valid than those of his students?

Maybe if they didn't have access to donated clothing, an industry cheaply producing a version of traditional clothing would arise, but that's hardly guaranteed.

She's also working on fish farming here and has already dug and started operating her own fish farm.  She's super impressive;  I kind of have a friend crush on her.\n\nSome kind of gross things, but I would say, carry hand sanitizer and toilet paper with you at all times.  Very useful.  I presume you know how you're going to purify your water already, but if you ever catch yourself without iodine tablets or your filter or whatever, you can get little packets of bleach wherever;  just put two drops of bleach per liter and let it sit for fifteen minutes and it's safe to drink.  It sounds weird, but a lot of water purification centers in the U.S. use chlorine bleach as part of their treatment process anyway.  You can drink a little bit of water from a swimming pool without any negative effects, and there's a lot more chlorine in that.\n\nFor street food, go with fruit that you can peel yourself (bananas are good) or food that you can watch them finish cooking.  You don't want anything that's been sitting out, or anything where they've directly touched something that you'll then eat.\n\nThe volunteer who's been to Tanzania before has some amazing dresses that she had made while she was there.  I would bring with you some pictures of things you want to have made, and then get some fabric there and ask around to find a good local tailor.  Great souvenirs.\n\nI wish I could be more specific, but I don't really know a lot about Tanzania.  Still, I'm sure you'll have an awesome time!  Be safe, have fun, do good archaeological field school things.\n\nETA:  A few other people mentioned malaria prophylaxis, so I just want to say, make sure to take your prophylaxis with food.  Whatever it is.  I had such bad nausea from Doxycycline even just from taking it with a small meal that I wound up going to the hospital thinking I had malaria.  And now I'm on Malarone, which is supposed to have much milder side effects, but even so, if I take it without food in the morning, I feel gross the whole day.  ALSO:  SLEEP UNDER A BED NET.  DO IT.  People who grow up in areas where malaria is endemic develop a slight resistance, and their bodies are better equipped to fight off malaria.  All the malaria prophylaxis does is get people who grew up in areas where malaria is not common to the same level of protection.  It does not completely protect you.  There are four risk groups for malaria:  pregnant women, children under the age of five, PLWHA, and people who grew up in areas where malaria is not endemic.  Protect yourself!  Malaria really sucks and can actually kill you scarily quickly and the malaria parasite found in subsaharan Africa (P. falciparum) is the most deadly of all the malaria parasites because it's really good at weaseling its way into your brain.  But the female Anopheles mosquito only hunts at night, so if you sleep under a bed net, you're very well protected.\n\nWorld Malaria Day is April twenty fifth, so I may be a little overzealous.  Sorry for going so over the top, but there are some volunteers who don't sleep under a net (even though we get them for free), and it drives me crazy!

The pattern didn't have any discrepancies that I needed to figure out, there were just a few annoying things.  At one point you have to make one (right after starting the yoke, before even beginning fair isle) to make the numbers work out, and it had me do that at the beginning of the round, which made one of the shoulders ever so slightly larger than the other--not noticeable, but enough to frustrate my desire for symmetry.  I followed the pattern because I couldn't tell if the location of the knit one would be important later, but it wasn't, so if I could do it again, I would make one in the middle of either the front or the back.  Also, sometimes the knit two togethers during the fair isle were placed such that they obscured the \"foreground\" color rather than the \"background\" color, the latter of which would have been less noticeable.  Again, I wasn't sure if changing it on the fly would cause problems, so I followed the pattern, but if I could do it again I would shift some of the knit two togethers one direction or another so that they only involved the background color, or I might change some of them to slip slip knits so that the \"foreground\" color would wind up in front of the \"background\" color.  I could go into more detail if you wanted, but you can probably see what I mean just by looking at the chart.\n\nIt's a good first sweater, I think.

A program that doesn't work just doesn't work, or it might have a really ugly and counter-intuitive interface.  Even people who don't know how to code can tell that it doesn't work.\n\nWriting and art are a little different.  If you don't know how to write, you're less likely to be able to tell the difference between something that's well-written and something that's poorly-written.  I remember once when I was helping my brother with an essay, and he got really annoyed that I was pointing out all his mistakes because he didn't think they were problematic.  He kept saying that it sounded fine to him, and I was trying to say (without being mean) \"Yes, it sounds fine to you or you wouldn't have made these mistakes in the first place, but to your teacher or the many other people who have internalized these grammar rules, it's going to sound really childish and bad\".\n\nIf you don't know how to write code and you try to write a program, it will be really obvious when you fail.  If you don't know how to write well, it's more difficult for you to tell the difference between what you come up with and writing that's actually effective because from your perspective, what you wrote *is* effective--you corrected all the mistakes you identified, and there's no built-in way for you to know if you've made other mistakes.  It's only other people who will notice all the mistakes that you didn't realize you were making.\n\nThis comparison doesn't make sense in a lot of ways, but I think it does help show how one can convince oneself that writing (or making art or designing clothes or what have you) is easier than programming (or math or chemistry or most STEM subjects).

I used to give blood a lot (I can't now since I visited a place that's a malaria risk) and the few times that my iron was too low to donate, I was advised not to drink tea.  The way it was explained to me, the tannins in the tea can inhibit the absorption of iron into the blood stream.  Tea definitely seems to lower the levels of iron in my blood, based on when I have and have not been able to donate.  In my case, however, drinking tea--even a lot of it--never seemed to make my iron dangerously low, just low enough that I couldn't give blood.  So it's quite possible that some people can drink tea and still be fine.  Personally, I switched to rooibos.  It's not actually tea, so it doesn't have the tannins, but I like the flavor just fine.

Public transportation in my city would take about an hour to get to the nearest movie theater, and there were a lot of places where buses just didn't travel.

I would purposefully not mention it, even when people asked very closely-related questions--one of my friends even emailed her advisor asking why her registration date was so long after mine before I finally told her.  That was clearly also the wrong way to handle it.\n\nBasically, don't bring it up just because people are talking about AP credits/dual-enrollment or scheduling, but don't hide it, either.  After I stopped bragging, I was really worried about what people thought and never mentioned it.  The correct thing to do, in my opinion, is to mention it briefly when people might be confused if they don't know (this is very rare) and not to mention it otherwise.\n\n(Maybe related:  I wound up graduating in three years.  First year is obviously freshman year, third year is obviously senior year.  Second year is confusing;  I felt like a sophomore in terms of the college experience, but I was more of a junior in terms of the classes I was taking.  I wound up just telling people I was in my second year and letting them make their own assumptions, but when I saw them next year and they found out I was graduating, they were confused.  But I don't think one should mention that they might graduate early every time they're telling someone their academic year, so I'm not sure exactly how that situation should have been handled.

For one thing, this might sound like a stupid, feminazi-ish thing, but you can't get rid of the only female Avenger they have right now.  It makes sense having only or mostly male characters (with the token love interest) in buddy cop movies or war movies or sports movies, but in an action movie where magic or science-virtually-indistinguishable-from-magic has given people superpowers, I don't see why I don't get to see a woman kicking ass right alongside the men.  The reality of women being, on average, smaller and weaker than men just doesn't apply here!  It might seem frivolous, but if there wasn't a female Avenger (especially since there are so many awesome ones in the comics (full disclosure, I haven't read a ton of the comics, but even just from the few I've read on MDCU, I know there are some kick ass female Avengers)), it would bother me--to the extent that I just wouldn't watch the movie.  I don't know if this would be a common opinion, but I do think that they would catch flak for it.  Even if it didn't actually bother anyone other than me, I think a lot of people would point it out just to criticize something popular.\n\nFor another thing, Black Widow is incredibly beloved among some segments of the fandom.  Female fans of the movie are, as far as I can tell, obsessed with her.  Fan fiction writers (I know, I know, I'm properly ashamed) have basically agreed that Black Widow is the biggest bad ass among the Avengers.  Again, I don't know how prevalent this view is, but at the very least an incredibly vocal part of the fandom would throw a shit fit.\n\nTL;DR, If they get rid of the one female Avenger even though this is one of the few movie universes where women's realistic physical limitations SHOULDN'T PREVENT THEM FROM KICKING ASS AND TAKING NAMES, I will be sad/pissed off and I don't think I'll be the only one.", "created_utc": "1368077233.0", "edited": "False", "id": "c9vc0y5", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_1dycly", "parent_id": "t1_c9v94sy", "score": "0", "subreddit": "movies", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s"}, {"author": "EpiceEmilie", "body": "I think black pumps would look good, or sandals that go with the colors of the skirt.

I like this question.  Physically, I feel like a normal woman, and there's nothing really masculine about me.  I'm taller than average, as are most people with Swyer syndrome, but not abnormally so (five foot nine, a bit unusual but not \"How's the weather up there?\" tall).  I have feminine facial features and feminine curves, and I really don't feel any different.  I think that, if I'd ever had ovaries, I'd be able to tell the difference between having them and not, but I don't know.  Physically I feel mostly the same.\n\nMentally and emotionally, I feel somewhere in between male and female, and that's mostly why I consider myself intersex.  I think that has more to do with growing up knowing that I have this condition, though, rather than having this condition.  I always knew that I wasn't completely female and that I couldn't have kids, and that really shaped my outlook on the world.  I don't think that most people can tell that I'm mentally or emotionally different from a \"normal\" woman (and it's quite possible that there are \"normal\" women who feel the same way, so maybe I'm not), but I think I'm a bit different in that way.\n\nI think the biggest difference is, of course, with sex and having kids.  I'm 20 and haven't had sex, which I suspect wouldn't be the case if I didn't have Swyer syndrome, although of course I don't know that for sure.  I just feel like I should tell someone about my condition before having sex with them, so that makes me more cautious.  I also have a very different perspective on having kids:  I've always considered adoption to be a very possible eventuality, whereas other people tend to perceive it as a last resort.  I've thought more than other young women I know about the environmental and social impacts of having children, and I've reached the conclusion that it's probably best not to have kids (I definitely understand and respect that other people have different points of view on this and that they are absolutely not wrong--we just consider the topic in two completely different ways).  This seems to be a controversial conclusion among most people, so I don't voice it often, but even if I don't voice it outwardly, my opinion on the topic of having children and my limitations in that area definitely make me feel different and a bit separate from the rest of the world.\n\nI suppose the biggest thing is that I can't satisfy the main evolutionary drive that humans experience.  It makes me feel very strange at times, even though I know that infertility is common.  I've known my whole life, so I'm really not sad about my limitations or jealous of people who aren't limited like I am, but it's very eerie for so much important conversation and thought and such a huge part of most people's lives to be something that I will never understand.\n\nThat might have gotten a bit off-topic/heavy, but I hope it answered your question/was interesting.", "created_utc": "1358904672.0", "edited": "False", "id": "c81tn53", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_16z0n5", "parent_id": "t1_c81iop5", "score": "2", "subreddit": "TwoXChromosomes", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r2jt"}, {"author": "EpiceEmilie", "body": "I'm pretty sure that Swyers have the same testosterone range as xxers.  The increased height is because people with Swyer Syndrome don't go through puberty until they realize that they won't naturally and start taking meds, so they undergo a longer prepubescent growth period before beginning the accelerated growth of puberty and finally stopping.  If anything, I'd expect that people with Swyer Syndrome have less testosterone, because there's no natural mechanism for producing sex hormones.  Caveat:  I'm pretty sure about this, but I'm not a doctor, so I could definitely be wrong.\n\nI don't know about the distribution of sexual orientation--I don't think there have been any studies about it.  I've heard that Swyer Syndrome affects anywhere from 1 in 20,000 people to 1 in 400,000 people (it's difficult to determine because it can't be detected until later in life and because doctors often don't tell their patients that they have the condition, although that practice is going away), so it's pretty dang rare.

Sorry for being bitchy about this, but you shouldn't try to speak for me if you don't know what you're talking about.\n\nIn Swyer Syndrome, there is a defect of the SRY gene on the Y chromosome which means that the gonads fail to develop into testes.  The fetus develops as (physically) female because the testes don't exist and thus don't release masculinizing hormones.  In Complete Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome, male development gets further:  the gonads develop into testes and start releasing masculinizing hormones.  The fetus develops as (externally) female because the receptors for the masculinizing hormones are faulty, and in the absence of other instructions, fetuses develop as female.\n\nIn Swyer Syndrome, male structures don't have time to develop before female development begins.  Women with Swyer Syndrome therefore have uteri and can, with hormone replacement therapy and an egg donor, bear children.  I can't have children who are genetically my own, but I could if I chose bear children.\n\nIn Complete Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome, male structures do have time to develop before female development begins, so people with CAIS don't have uteri.

Although most of the gathering is usually done by women, a society in which men completely abstained from gathering easily available plants has yet to be found. Generally women hunt the majority of the small game while men hunt the majority of the large and dangerous game, but there are quite a few documented exceptions to this general pattern. A study done on the Aeta people of the Philippines states: \"About 85% of Philippine Aeta women hunt, and they hunt the same quarry as men.

Yes, it's more common for women to gather and men to hunt, especially large game, but it's not universal.  There are, as phantomofspaceopera points out, evolutionary adaptations which make women better at some jobs and men better at other jobs, but these sex-based differences aren't so extreme that it was impossible for men to gather and women to hunt--in fact, there are absolutely no known hunter-gatherer societies in which men ONLY hunted and women ONLY gathered.\n\nIf you keep reading the wikipedia article, it says that \"the sexual division of labor ... developed relatively recently in human history\", suggesting to me that biology did not force women to gather and men to hunt--rather, humans realized that sharing tasks like that was advantageous.\n\nI really love that Aeta men and women working together are more successful than a group composed entirely of one sex or other.  We're stronger when we're not fighting over which sex is more oppressed or did the most work in a type of society none of us currently live in.  :)\n\nTL;DR:  Here are some wiki-facts which support your statement that, yes, it is completely idiotic to assume that, in hunter-gatherer societies, men always hunted and women always gathered.", "created_utc": "1345867173.0", "edited": "False", "id": "c5yf8br", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_yrs1q", "parent_id": "t1_c5y9r60", "score": "1", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i"}, {"author": "EpiceEmilie", "body": "Pretty sure passing on the right is illegal in most places.

Don't judge me.\n\n[The Progress of Sherlock Holmes](http://archiveofourown.org/works/173274/chapters/253157#main) is a story narrated by Sherlock in the first person.  The narration has a scattered, neurotic quality that is somehow wonderfully evocative instead of annoying, and for a fic that focuses pretty primarily on a homosexual relationship, the characterization is quite good.

I don't know if everything the fic says about mental illness or wilderness survival is accurate, but I do know that it's convincing, and that the story is very moving.  Parts get very dark and disturbing, but in a beautifully hopeless way.\n\n[The Theory of Narrative Causality](http://falling-voices.livejournal.com/18100.html) is a metafic about two Sherlock Holmes fans, named Sherlock Holmes and John Watson, interacting online in a universe without the BBC Sherlock.  I'd mention this fic just for its convincing mimicry of fan culture, LJ communities, and online drama, but it also has a plot (imagine that).
