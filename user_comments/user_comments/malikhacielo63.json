I apologize for the text wall. I'm often quite verbose, and this is the cut down version. If I trigger you or come across as condescending, I apologize: that is not my intent. I reread this text multiple times to ensure it didn't sound bad. I just want to say that what you wrote spoke to me on a deeply emotional level. I also wanted to encourage you by saying that you are not alone.\n\nBoth sides of my family are African American; however, I was born and raised for the first half of my life in a county whose population is approximately 60,000 people. Of those 60,000 people, only about 4% are black. I lived in one of the most rural parts of an already rural county, the part where the population of blacks was under 1% .  The radio was extremely \"white\", to give you an idea, it was a big deal when a jazz station made its way to our rural \"neck of the woods.\" My parents were very selective about whom they let me play with; however, I was acutely aware of the fact that I stood out and wasn't like everyone else. Most people were nice, but I often felt that  I didn't \"belong.\" I was supposed to be able to do the stuff that they saw black people do on TV, and if I couldn't do it, I somehow came across as disappointing. That made me  feel like a fraud, because I didn't understand that the reason why so many of those dancers that I would occasionally see on TV were so good was because they had practiced for hours. Instead, I was just taught that black people \"had rhythm\" and because I could not \"turn it on at will\", I was a disappointment. Strangely, in church I learned that all of those \"cool\" things that black people did were \"of the Devil\", and thus it was better if I \"acted White.\" I still made a lot of friends, but I learned to hide myself because they didn't seem to accept me. I felt \"wrong.\" I learned to compartmentalize and separate the parts of myself that they didn't like away from them, but I was still \"less than them\" in some weird way.\n\nYou would think that I would fit in with my extended family who lived in a major city, but nope. The \"family\" ostracized my parents. They would viciously bully me because, as an older cousin would later confess to me, they were jealous of the fact that I had both parents and that I was living in a white area. They mocked the way that I spoke, they would gift me clothing that was \"more black\", and then bully me again by claiming that even though I was wearing the clothing, I was bad at acting \"black.\" Somehow or other, no matter how hard I tried, to them, I was just \"wrong.\" I learned to compartmentalize and separate the parts of myself that they didn't like away from them, but I was still \"less than them\" in some weird way.\n\nAs an adult, I still don't feel like I \"belong.\" However, I realize that making me feel like I was \"wrong\" was the point: they felt inferior to me for reasons outside of my control, so they put me into situations that I wasn't familiar with, but they were. This put me  at a disadvantage, where I was reliant on them to learn, and what they did was take their low self-esteem and project it on to me, deliberately choosing to abuse and bully me so that they could make themselves feel better. Some of these people were children, some were the age that I am now.\n\nI'm in my early 30s now, and I have by no means figured out life. All that I want to say--as someone who has engaged in bullying where I made jokes about people being mixed, not understanding how messed up the behavior I was parroting is until years later--is be true to yourself. I know that sounds cliched as hell, but it's the truth. You are a person, a human being, and you have to accept yourself, above all of the hurtful things people say and do. Their actions are terrible, but it's even worse if you internalize their beliefs about you and make it  your default narrative for yourself. You are normal; they, because of the horrible beliefs about themselves that this culture promotes, feel like they aren't good enough. Ergo, they have to make you feel the way they feel just so that they can feel better about themselves. Making them feel better is not your responsibility.

Such societies used White Christian Supremacy as a means of justifying their conquests. I\u2019m not saying that no White person was against colonialism and White Supremacy; however, opposing those systems was and is difficult. In the beginning, European empires may not have explicitly used the word \u201cWhite\u201d but they would eventually define themselves under that label, after they had already defined Native American societies and cultures and South-of-the-Sahara African societies and cultures as \u201cRed\u201d and \u201cBlack\u201d respectively. They defined these societies as monoliths solely defining them based upon their skin color in comparison to Europeans, not based upon how the peoples saw themselves. I don\u2019t believe that skin color coincides with morality; however, such a system of thought is quite tempting and powerful. Trump claiming to be a Christian, being a White man, and his misogyny keep him in the Christian American Right\u2019s playbook.\nCheck out the book \u201cWhite Too Long\u201d by Robert P. Jones, as well as \u201cUnsettling Truths: The Ongoing, Dehumanizing Legacy of the Doctrine of Discovery\u201d by Mark Charles and Soong-Chang Rah. I\u2019m going to read the article now. \n\nAnother source that has heavily influenced my viewpoint is my life. I grew up in several White Evangelical churches in the  1990s and early 2000s. Their doctrines formed my viewpoints about life in general, including myself. I realize that such evidence is anecdotal, so you don\u2019t have to take it as dogma; however, it is real for my life. My family and I were often the only black people in church for miles. I was aware of pastors whom the congregation excused for embezzlement, molestation, generally cruel behavior against the elderly, etc. Racism wasn\u2019t always the only reason that such behavior was excused; instead, sometimes the congregation genuinely believed that said person was \u201canointed by God.\u201d Yet, such a setting allowed pastors who were racist to get away with it, and a racist congregation didn\u2019t help. Some of these congregations were heavily invested in maintaining the right \u201cwhite to other\u201d ratio in their church. One church encouraged immigrants from various African nations, many of them refugees, to come to the US, and then used said people as free labor. A church out West was vocally racist against Hispanics and Native Americans, even though their church was heavily populated by Hispanics and near a prominent reservation. The pastor hated the fact that so many non whites were in his church but had no problem demanding his tithe money every week. Don\u2019t even get me started on their treatment of women. Even the non-white churches that were a part of this system were still beholden to White Supremacy because they believed the teachings of the sects founder\u2014a mealy-mouthed 1930s-1960s multimillionaire traveling evangelist who had deep ties to the KKK\u2014to be \u201cGod-inspired.\u201d The founder\u2019s affiliations were only known by the inner circle, but the 2010s, long after I had left, ripped the lid off of the whole thing.", "created_utc": "1662402543.0", "edited": "1662405931.0", "id": "in7r087", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_x6izv5", "parent_id": "t3_x6izv5", "score": "5", "subreddit": "Trumpvirus", "subreddit_id": "t5_2gg7fd"}, {"author": "malikhacielo63", "body": "I am so fucking tired of this narcissistic, projecting turd.

If not, what other works would you recommend someone who is interested in this topic read? I ask because as of late I\u2019ve been quite interested in the Doctrine of Discovery as it relates to the Transatlantic Slave Trade, European colonization of the Americas, and how these factors affected the formation of the United States of America. I acknowledge that my interests are quite broad, but I want to understand at least approximately where this idea traces back to. \n\n2. How much of an influencing factor did the idea of reforming a christian roman empire have on the Church and those rulers who at least nominally  followed its dicta? Was the reformation of such a state a real political goal, or was it instead merely useful theater to organize people and resources for the ruler\u2019s personal gain? \n\n3. A final, potentially unrelated question: I assume that the Latin word col\u014dnus is an ancestor of our modern word colony. Was colonization a distinctly Roman practice that later European states absorbed into their cultural DNA and customized to suit their needs, or was it a direct continuation of what the Romans practiced?\n\nSorry if I have broken any rules: to do so was not my intent.

The \u201cEasy Language\u201d argument. Just because that chart you read online says that Spanish is an easier language for English speakers to learn than Arabic, does not mean Spanish is an easy language to learn. We still have to put in a considerable amount of effort to acquire the language, and part of that time is sifting through and finding which methods work and don\u2019t work for us.\nThem: \u201cOh, you are studying Arabic?

If you are going to Christian camp, you may hear some things that will be very hurtful to you. What you need to remember is that no matter what that person in the pulpit says, you are a human being worthy of respect. If they start saying that you are \u201ca no good sinner\u201d and that \u201cyou deserve nothing\u201d, then you need to remember, and I will reiterate this statement, that you are a human being, you are worthy of dignity and respect, you are a child and no one should be trying to scare you into doing what they want anyway. \n        Furthermore, you deserve the world, kid. I\u2019m not going to ask anymore questions because I don\u2019t feel comfortable talking to kids on the internet, but I want you to seriously make that list of why you are a good person and why you\u2019re not dirt. I want you to write down all of the things that you love to do that make you, well, you. Do not, I repeat, DO NOT let others get into your head and hold you to standards that they themselves can\u2019t live up to. To do that to others is pure and simple abuse and no one deserves to go through it. Stay safe. Stay sane. You will make it through this.\n\n  If they try to make you feel bad about Jesus\u2019 crucifixion, I want you to remember that, according to the story, Jesus chose that outcome\nbecause he and God thought that it was best for humankind. Why would I have to feel like I\u2019m nothing for that? Apparently, I must be worth something because the supposed \u201cGod of the Universe\u201d came down in human form and died for me, and he thought that was the best option.\n\nEdit: Furthermore, make sure that you are around people who you can trust to stand up for you if someone tries to hurt you. If you feel uncomfortable around someone and specifically like you shouldn\u2019t be anywhere alone with them, then listen to your gut. Despite all of the talk about how \u201cthe church\u201d is different from \u201cthe world\u201d, the truth is that church is a part of the world. Therefore, the same rules apply in church as they do in the street. You may run into people who try to gaslight you into believing that what you saw wasn\u2019t real. Believe yourself, not them, no matter how crazy someone may try to make you feel. I knew a lot of good people in church whom I trusted.

She thought it was going to be her kind of evangelical church; it wasn\u2019t. They would make you go to the altar, kneel, and then they would beat you until the \u201cHoly Spirit\u201d entered into you. The evidence that they were searching for? The person being assaulted had to shout and then pass out, laying on the floor as if they were dead. At that point, the \u201cannointers\u201d would move on to the next person. Before the annointers even got to her, Aunt Susan proceeded to pass out and just lay there, completely still. The annointers rejoiced and moved on.\n\nMy point? Rejoice, relax as much as you can at Christian camp, but don\u2019t condemn yourself for faking it. I\u2019ve got a newsflash for you: everyone else there is faking it too; they\u2019re just acting like they aren\u2019t. If someone starts throwing Bible passages at you and demands that you pray, and you feel that you don\u2019t have a choice, then go ahead and pray. But act like it\u2019s someone trying to make a sales pitch to you, accept that you don\u2019t believe it, and hold on to your intellectual integrity. If you won\u2019t get in trouble for it, take a mental inventory of all of the things that you believe right now. When you return from camp, write down every little nagging thought that\u2019s kicking around in your mind that could\u2019ve come from that place. If that idea doesn\u2019t match up with your first list or it somehow makes you feel like crap, purge it from your mind and tell it to F off.

The \u201cfirst black\u201d whatever magic worked when Obama was in office and the alternative was McCain or Romney. Now, I\u2019m watching people act like Biden and Harris don\u2019t have the record that they do while also pretending that the moment their feet touched Washington D.C., the past 4 years of Trump simply melted away or didn\u2019t happen. \n\nIt is an accomplishment that Harris is the first female vice-president and that she attained this role while also being a person of color. What would be even better is if our government cared about more than just \u201cgetting\u201d us \u201cback to work\u201d and \u201clooking woke.\u201d I am firmly of the opinion that \u201clooking woke\u201d is different from and  far less important than actually \u201cbeing woke\u201d on important global and domestic social issues. By that statement I mean actually doing what\u2019s right and what works, not just appearing to do great things while kicking the proverbial can down the road. Platitudes and commercials mean nothing. I voted Bernie twice in the primaries and watched him be mocked and maligned. I voted for Clinton and Biden in the 2016 and 2020 general elections respectively, and I did both while holding my nose. \n\nI hated Trump and am happy that he\u2019s no longer the President, but there was one thing that I liked about him. Despite how his staff tried to lie and claim that he was such a great person, the man himself was so horrible, he couldn\u2019t pretend for five seconds to be the person who they said he was. I knew that he was a liar and also a horrible person. In contrast, I fully expect for people to be lulled into a false sense of security with this new administration, while none of the issues that brought us a Trump are addressed, and such inaction leading us to the possible election of someone worse than Trump. \n\nI think what makes me even sicker about Biden and Harris is the fact that they are trying to \u201creach across the isle\u201d and work with disgusting people like Lindsey Graham and Mitch McConnell. I don\u2019t have anything good to say about Rand Paul or Tom Cotton either. We watched many Republicans do horrible things these past four years, and now they get a free pass? Only ten of them voted to impeach Trump and that was AFTER he, on TV, ALLEGEDLY encouraged the events that led to the Jan 6th attempted coup. Some of these same Republican mother******* refused to wear masks, getting several colleagues sick with COVID-19, while another tweeted the location of the Speaker of the House to ARMED domestic terrorists. Every single Republican should at least be so publicly shamed and alienated from their donors that they resign. \n\nI am not calling for violence against these people; I am calling for accountability and consequences for their horrible actions that have contributed to the deaths of nearly half of a million people over the past 9 or 10 months due to COVID 19 alone. I could give a crap about Harris\u2019 ethnic background right now.\n\nPS. Also, I really don\u2019t want to hear the \u201csoap boxing\u201d as I call it of \u201cgo out and get involved in your community. Be the change!\u201d I\u2019m sick of it. Stop using such toxic positivity to get me to shut up because you don\u2019t like what I\u2019m saying. I will be trying to educate myself this year on what\u2019s happening, but I am so done with the empty and vapid moral grandstanding that is American politics.\n\nSource: An African American male who is tired of nothing changing.\n\n\nTL;DR I don\u2019t want to hear about change; I want to actually see it. Harris\u2019 ethnicity means nothing if the same policies that got us a Trump remain in place. Race isn\u2019t a moral stance, it\u2019s just the culture that you\u2019re born in.\n\nEdit: Took \u201carmed\u201d out of air quotes and put it in all caps for emphasis.\n\nEdit 2: Thank you for the award! I don\u2019t want to take away from the positive things that Biden has done so far-i.e. bringing us back into the Paris Climate Accords, Cancelling the Keystone Pipeline, Extending the freeze on Student Loan Interests, or the work that he\u2019s doing with DACA, as well as stopping construction on the wall.  But that\u2019s not enough, and that doesn\u2019t excuse his behavior in regards to Iran or Venezuela. We need massive changes to ensure that we don\u2019t see the rise of a Trump 2.0, and we need to find ways to help ALL Americans during this crisis. Half measures aren\u2019t enough. We need drastic action and we need it NOW. Not working with unethical, spineless, greedy politicians and business magnates. We need a change now.

I\u2019m not ex-Mormon; instead, I come from a somewhat obscure evangelical cult. I grew up in and around that organization for the first half of my life. I\u2019m also a racial minority. When I was in my early teens, I got baptized due to \u201cGod calling me to the altar.\u201d That was the stated reason, but my real reason was out of guilt for playing \u201cdoctor\u201d with the downstairs neighbor\u2019s daughter. The fire-and-brimstone sermons from a week-long \u201ctent revival\u201d didn\u2019t help my kid mind much either. Once I got baptized, I immediately started trying to \u201clive\u201d like Christ. It was a miserable experience that I would never wish on anyone, and it began right around the time that I started puberty. I was afraid of gay people because it was something that was outside of my norm, my family, and the church said I should be afraid of them. I was afraid of the Roman Catholic Church because they were filled with \u201cGay, Child-Raping, Antichrist Pedophiles who didn\u2019t love Jesus.\u201d We left out of that toxic environment 3 years after I got baptized, but most of the damage had already been done. I\u2019m a racial minority, Black, and the church leadership made sure to preach sermons that reminded me of \u201cmy place.\u201d Specifically, I, as a black man, marrying a white woman was seen as being equivalent to the relationship that you\u2019ve documented in this picture. In a Christian context, such a statement was damning, and it didn\u2019t help that my first pornographic experience was being exposed to Lesbian porn by my friend. I thought that I was quickly descending down a slippery path that would eventually have God stripping me of my attraction to women and \u201cturning me over to homosexuality.\u201d I feared \u201cthe left\u201d as they would be called today, because I thought they were trying to \u201ccontrol my sexuality.\u201d They were making me miserable in my own life and then telling me that the only way for me to experience the false happiness that they promised was to make someone else\u2019s life miserable. \n\nIt\u2019s been a long journey of healing, but I just realized yesterday that \u201cthe left\u201d wasn\u2019t the one telling me that my sexuality was bad, they weren\u2019t telling me to control it and hide it away, making me feel ashamed of it. The left wasn\u2019t telling me that my crush on \u201cSister Susan\u201d was wrong. It was the so-called god fearing church that was doing all of these things to me, and I have still been carrying those scars and burden with me all of these years. I wish you nothing but happiness in your new relationship. I will admit that it takes work for me to be affirming and accepting of LGBTQ+ relationships. I was so used to living like a moralistic judge, and letting go of that mindset has felt like losing a Kevlar vest in the middle of a firefight. Yet, I feel at peace, and whenever anyone tries to drag me back, I get angry and feel like I want to throw up in my mouth. \n\nThey\u2019re always telling all of us, referring to anyone whose ex-whatevergroup, that a loving relationship had to fit their prescriptive dogma. But the truth, as you so bluntly stated, is that no one has the right to tell any of us whom we are supposed to be happy spending the rest of our lives with.
