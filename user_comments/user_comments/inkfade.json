I only recently discovered the idea of one bagging and am so excited to share my first attempt here, as in the past I\u2019ve always been the type to pack way more than necessary.\n\nMy boyfriend and I are flying to Chicago, IL from Nashville, TN, staying four days/four nights at an Airbnb, then flying back on the fifth day. I\u2019ve been to Chicago plenty of times to visit family, but this will be my first time not surrounded by family, my boyfriend\u2019s third time, and our first time together.\n\nI\u2019ve been doing a lot of research concerning backpacks and travel accessories after falling down the one bagging rabbit hole, and ultimately settled on Cotopaxi for my main bag (Allpa 35L in black iris) due to their beautiful designs and company ethics, and Osprey for my daypack (Daylite 13L in all black). Also bought some accessories from Cotopaxi, and bundled my backpack with some other items.\n\nGoogle tells me that while we\u2019re there, the temperatures will range from the low 60s to upper 70s F, and that it is likely to rain intermittently, which is AWESOME because that is my favorite type of weather. Additionally, I am 5\u201910, typically wear clothing size 18/20, and wear women\u2019s size 11 shoes. I mention this because, as a plus-size woman with clown feet, my clothes/shoes will take up more space in my bag than somebody who is petite or has regular-sized feet. I will be keeping all of my rolled clothes in my largest packing cube (10L) and my socks/undies in a smaller cube (2L).\n\nI tend towards neutrals and like to mix and match; every top I have matches every bottom, no matter the combination, so I don\u2019t have to spend any time thinking about what outfit I want to wear for the day. I plan on wearing my Hoka Cliftons (black/white) for the entire trip.\n\nAll of my toiletries fit in my Cotopaxi Nido accessory bag. I do not plan on bringing shampoo or body wash, as this will be supplied by our Airbnb host, as well as towels and other amenities.\n\nI plan on leaving my Allpa backpack at the Airbnb when we\u2019re there and only carrying around my Daylite backpack, which will be stored flat in the Allpa at the airport/during the plane ride. In the pictures, my Daylite is on the right side and my clothes on the left side, but I will likely swap that so the heavier clothes are directly against my back, as I think that will be more comfortable.\n\nEverything on my packing list that is in **bold** will be carried in the 13L after arriving in Chicago, other than my Apple watch which obviously will be worn at all times.\n\nI had originally debated on using a large hip pack for this trip, but then decided I wanted something a little bigger that could hold my water bottle and my hoodie if I wanted to take it off. I also wanted something water resistant (as it might rain on us, and we plan on going kayaking), which is what led me to settle on the Osprey Daylite after sifting through so many bags of the same size.\n\nI\u2019m glad to have something bigger than a hip pack (but smaller than the Allpa) to use around the city, because there\u2019s room for more than just the essentials without being too bulky or unwieldy. Also, there are a couple of fountain pen stores and museum gift shops I plan to hit up, and should have room for souvenirs in the Daylite if I buy anything (spoilers: I will).\n\nSide note: I convinced my boyfriend to try one bagging this trip! Whenever he travels, he takes a huge suitcase (like, at least 80L) and doesn\u2019t end up packing until the morning of and just chucks whatever shit he finds into it, and always ends up taking way more than he needs, as well as forgetting important items like his toothbrush or deodorant. I sat down with him a while ago and we looked through a bunch of backpacks, talked about needs, sizes, and situations, and he settled on a green Osprey Stratos 36. I\u2019ll help him come up with a packing list for the trip, hopefully this helps him!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Clothes (plane outfit included)*\n\n1x thin, full-zip hoodie (black)\n\n1x pullover (1 light gray)\n\n2x t-shirts (1 black, 1 plum)\n\n2x tank (1 specifically for sleeping)\n\n2x joggers (1 regular black, 1 regular olive green)\n\n1x yoga pants (black)\n\n5x underwear\n\n5x socks\n\n1x bra\n\nHoka sneakers\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Toiletries*\n\nToothbrush\n\nToothpaste\n\nBirth control pills\n\nDental picks\n\nQ-tips\n\nArtificial tears\n\nDeodorant\n\nComb\n\n**Sunscreen (100 mL tube) in a Ziploc baggie**\n\nEyeliner\n\nBrow pencil\n\nLipstick\n\nTweezers\n\nNail clippers\n\nSmall face wash cloth (I like to bring my own even if these are supplied by hosts)\n\nPanty liners\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Electronics*\n\n**Phone** \\+ cord\n\n**Apple Watch** \\+ cord\n\n**Airpod Pros**\n\nKindle Paperwhite\n\niPad Pro 11\u201d + cord / stylus + cord\n\nCanon Ivy mini printer + cord (will go into journaling supplies pouch)\n\nCharging brick\n\nSmall tripod\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Miscellaneous*\n\n**Journal (A5 size) + 1 fountain pen and 1 rollerball pen**\n\nSmall canvas pouch with journaling supplies (mini scissors, double-sided tape, etc.)\n\n**Card case**\n\n**Rx glasses**\n\n**Rx sunglasses + pouch**\n\n**Water bottle**\n\n**4x surgical masks**\n\n**2x cloth mask**\n\nNot pictured: Hoka shoes, zip hoodie, charging brick and handful of surgical masks which I plan on swiping from work before I leave.

My Kindle Paperwhite, rx sunglasses, pouch with miscellaneous items, etc. other items go there.\n\nI tend to like neutrals for my EDC, but purple is my favorite color and this is my exact favorite shade of purple.

A hiking backpack, a smaller travel backpack, an even smaller day pack for my EDC, and then a hip pack for travel since I like to keep my things close to my body on my front when in very crowded places.\n\nThey will all definitely get used, which is good, but they hadn't been planned purchases. Despite this, I'm still super happy to have them all. \n\nI will be selling my previous EDC backpack (it was too small for my needs, which is why I bought the new daypack which I love way more), along with my three Samsonite suitcases that were bought last year and never even got used. Plan on just traveling with one bag from now on, to keep things minimal and easy on me. \n\nHave bought around $100 worth of pen-related things this month, which were prohibited according to my rules. Only $35 of that had been planned, the rest was impulse. The things I bought will definitely get used, though. Some refills and a notebook of my favorite paper, which I am running out of. \n\nBought some chocolate earlier this month, totaling around $20, which was not needed. My weight loss has not been going well. I really need to buckle down. I know a lot of it is related to boredom or emotion, so need to work on that. Will start keeping track of calories in MyFitnessPal again, that always seems to keep me levelheaded since I actually know how many calories I've eaten for the day.\n\nAlso bought dinner for my bf for his birthday, which was technically allowed since it was his gift. That was $33 at a new restaurant he wanted to try. We both really liked it.\n\nSo... though I'm really excited to have all my new purchases, I feel like shit because I've kind of been ignoring my no buy. I'm not asking myself the questions at the bottom of the graphic I made. I'm not even giving a second thought to the stuff I'm buying.\n\nMy resolve is to get back on it starting today. I have not done well and need to do better. I made this commitment for 2022 and want to see it through to the end.\n\nI know it will be worth it, as despite my purchases this year so far, I have an additional $7000+ in my account that I did not have three months ago, simply from not spending AS wildly as I did last year, or the year before. Granted, about $1500 of that is due to a refund from refinancing our mortgage, and a large refund from a purchase in late 2021 that didn't get accepted until 2022. But still.

If I hadn't returned a couple of pricy items and got refunded within the next couple of weeks, I would have been unable to pay my bills for the month.\n\nThe reality of me ACTUALLY not having enough in my bank account to make it another month terrified me and forced me to start my no buy. When it comes to improving myself (not just with money), but with health, etc., I feel like I have to get right to the edge and everything is about to fall apart before I begin working on things. Which sucks, but part of the no buy is also working on my willpower lol. \n\nWhat I do is write down every single purchase and categorize it. Bills, groceries, gas, and miscellaneous items. Everything is necessary except miscellaneous items. At the end of the month, I calculate what percentage of my monthly income I spent on these different categories. Having to write down every single thing helps to keep me accountable, because I don't want to write anything down other than absolute necessities. \n\nWhen I write down \"fast food\" or something, I feel like shit, because I know I'm doing something I'm not supposed to be doing. I know I'm doing something to hinder myself, something that is taking me farther away from my goal.

I think this is a great idea,  by the way, and love that there's a place for quick daily check-ins!\n\nHere is the graphic I designed for my rules, on Canva: [imgur.com/a/HVg6WXJ](https://imgur.com/a/HVg6WXJ)\n\nI have been totally successful with my no buy this year so far. I am keeping track of every single purchase in my Hobonichi Weeks and at the end of the month categorizing everything so I can see what percentage of my income is going where.\n\nI actually started a low buy in December to prepare myself for the stricter no buy, and it went quite well. It also helps that I have started listing hobby items I no longer need up for sale, so I sold quite a bit in December, too; overall I saved around $400 from my income (plan to increase that monthly amount with the no buy year), and profited around $500 from sold hobby items, for a total of close to $900 added to my bank account.\n\nIn January so far I have spent:\n\n$12.55 - movie ticket\n\n$19.11 - groceries\n\n$5.23 - postage (mailing an item I sold)\n\n$21 - haircut\n\n$40 - phone bill\n\n$8.04 - postage (mailing an item I sold)\n\nThe only questionable items would normally be the movie ticket and haircut, but I am allowing \"experiences\" like going to the movies or a museum because I do that so rarely (like maybe three times a year) and it is time spent with my boyfriend out of the house, which is always nice.\n\nAlso I have been meaning to get a haircut for months now and finally got sick enough of my long hair to get it cut off earlier this week. In my mind that was necessary since it was getting stuck in my armpits and becoming too much trouble to put up everyday for work lol. I never get extra stuff done to my hair and likely will not get it cut for another year or so, so it will not be a recurring thing.\n\nI have a wishlist that I will put items on, but will not buy immediately, I MUST think long and hard whether I REALLY need it. Also have a preapproved purchase list with two unnecessary items that I plan on buying. Technically they will break my no buy, but I feel ok about these two things because I have wanted them for longer than six months. One purchase will be about $30 (if they ever come back in stock), and the other around $300. The larger amount is actually some hobby items I am having worked on that I sent out months ago before I knew I was going to do a no spend year, so I have to pay to get them back lol.\n\nI did have way more items on my preapproved purchase list, but decided that was ridiculous and I wasn't being strict with myself, so took off maybe four or five other items and moved them to my wishlist. If they are there for months, I might buy them, but will check the list periodically and remove items I don't feel like I need anymore. I feel like this will be a good strategy, as I've already removed a few items from the wishlist that I thought I really wanted only a week ago.\n\nOverall I am extremely proud of myself. I've done great so far and have also unsubscribed from all emails concerning shops I typically frequent to help avoid temptation.\n\nToday we are going grocery shopping, and I am only buying essentials. No snacks.\n\nLooking forward to a successful no spend year, and seeing everybody else's progress here!", "created_utc": "1641648270.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hrrvwm7", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_ryrvwq", "parent_id": "t3_ryrvwq", "score": "8", "subreddit": "NoBuyDailyCheckIn", "subreddit_id": "t5_5lj2um"}, {"author": "inkfade", "body": "[https://www.oberondesign.com/search?type=product&q=sunflower%20journal\\*](https://www.oberondesign.com/search?type=product&q=sunflower%20journal*)\n\nThese are refillable so you can pick your own lined journal, the one they come with is blank.

I have struggled with this quite a bit in the past year.\n\nI got up to about 40 fountain pens and maybe close to 20 bottles of ink before freaking out about the amount, and how I never used most of them, what a waste of money, blah blah blah. Sold most of my collection off with the intent to keep it small and curated. I want to own only pens that I love using and have kept it down to about ten, which sometimes still feels like too much. And if I have a pen that comes in that I really, really love, I feel the need to get rid of another one to keep it around a certain amount.\n\nI see photos of people's collections of like 50+ pens, or even 100+ or 200+ and it makes me anxious because I think that could have been me if I didn't reign myself in. The amount of space and clutter that many pens takes up, the 100+ bottles of inks that you will obviously not finish in your lifetime, it just seems so useless and wasteful and draining.\n\nI want to be a user of fountain pens and inks, not a collector. I get no joy out of seeing unused things that are meant to be used, and this includes things like pen cases and journal covers, etc. It just feels like a massive waste of time and energy to me. Of course, if that's what somebody enjoys, props to them. Personally, it would stress me out lol.\n\nI never want to get back to where I was, even though my \"worst\" probably isn't worth mentioning in comparison to some people's collections. All I know is it made me anxious and regretful and ashamed.\n\nNow when I purchase pens or accessories, they MUST meet certain requirements and I like to think to myself, \"Will I use this pen more than my current favorites?\" If not, I don't buy it or I return it. Like I said, I only want to write with favorites, that makes this hobby all the more enjoyable.\n\nMore recently, I purchased a Sailor with a 21k broad nib. It is the most enjoyable nib I have likely ever used, a super comfy pen body, etc. Shortly after, I bought another one, and then have another one on the way to me in the mail. Since I've recently added three new pens, I am already thinking, \"What pens in my current rotation will I ignore now that I have these Sailors that I love? What pens can I get rid of and not miss over these Sailors?\" So soon I will get rid of at least a couple of pens in my current rotation, because they just won't compare to my Sailors and what's the point of them taking up space if I don't use them? \n\nOf course, I feel like part of my accumulating has been due to searching for my \"perfect\" pen. I believe I may have found it in Sailor, so don't feel too bad about having multiples. Also won't feel bad about getting rid of some of my other pens, because they just don't compare.", "created_utc": "1608486738.0", "edited": "False", "id": "gghzqr3", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_kgr37o", "parent_id": "t3_kgr37o", "score": "2", "subreddit": "fountainpens", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s0ew"}, {"author": "inkfade", "body": "That's interesting that the terms differ like that.
