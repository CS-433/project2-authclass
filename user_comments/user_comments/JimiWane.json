When I read, it's like I'm reading a story, I understand the card placements as plot points/turns, and I weave all of them together into a narrative, usually with some cold reading and feedback from the person I'm reading for, and I leave it up to them to come up with their own conclusions. I tell them up front this is how I do this and that I neither can provide nor should they seek real life lessons from some drunk with cards.\n\nThat's my answer though.

Is the Dude heroic, a loser, both? Something else? \n\nPersonally, the way I take it is that it isn't as simple as any of those, because ultimately, he's the Dude, and he's human, and humans are all of those things and none of those things depending on what's going on and who's asking.\n\nThe Dude abiding is another example of his being influenced by other characters in the story. By abiding, the Dude differentiates himself from the Big Lebowski, who WILL NOT ABIDE ANOTHER TOE.\n\nThe Dude appears to stand for nothing, while the Big Lebowski appears to be righteous and upstanding, but in reality, the Dude does stand for things while the Big Lebowski is, in every way, a sham. \n\nThe things the Dude happens to stand for just happen to be things that mostly benefit or trouble him. The whole plot begins with the Dude standing up for his rug (it really tied the room together) and that grasping attachment causes him to stand for more and more things (his car, his special lady, the Big Lebowski's scheme, keeping his Johnson) and ultimately, it blows up in his face.\n\nThe Big Lebowski, on the other hand, is a philanthropist. He's very attached to the idea of his military service, to his philanthropy, to meeting Nancy Reagan, but ultimately, he's a small man in a wheelchair whose daughter hates him and who really has nothing of his own. He postures as a self-made man but was entirely built up by his previous marriage, and even in his current sham marriage, he can neither satisfy Bunny nor offer her a nice enough environment that she doesn't just up and go out of town without telling her.\n\nSo at the end, when the Dude begins to abide, he's actually lost a lot more than most people realize. One of his two best friends has died, his car was set on fire, he never got paid by the Big Lebowski, he never gets his rug back... and yet, the Dude abides. The Big Lebowski won't abide, will never abide. But the Dude abides.\n\nIs that heroic? I don't know. Is it comforting? Yeah. Because even after all that, how does the movie end?

At the same time, because she was there, I came out to a family friend of ours, who happens to be a therapist (not planned on my part) and it was rough for the first half hour but eventually, after a lot of crying on my part and her part and the friend's part, now she knows. \n\nAfter my Mom knew, I literally stopped caring about people knowing.

My ancestors' dead religion, but a thoroughly dead religion none the less. There aren't really stable rituals, stable morals, even stable theology. Reconstructionist paganisms, meaning no disrespect at all, are entirely new religions that dress in historical scholarship that is, at best, guess work for Northern/Western Europeans as we weren't keen on writing things down until the Christians forced us into conversion.\n\nMeanwhile, the Dharmic religions have rich, multi-cultural bodies of scholarship that, yes, I need translated to me, but they all have multiple, established traditions, well-thought-out and well-argued philosophies and theologies, and actual systems of morality set in place. When Buddhists quote their thinkers, they can actually quote them. I have no idea what druids or Iron Age Heathens were thinking with the rituals that we have evidence of, they didn't tell us. But the Buddhists? The Hindus? The Jains? They don't just tell you why, they argue about it, they write it down, they transmit it.\n\nUltimately, that was the difference for me: a new religious movement that attracts all kinds of crazies I don't have strong arguments besides \"I disagree\" for, or a tradition that's no less foreign to my experience but has centuries of thought and practice behind it. \n\nAfter that my big question was, Advaita or Buddhism?

After Roy dies Morty is removed from the machine and has a short breakdown as he, while playing Roy, ceased to identify at all with Morty. It was traumatic for him, to go through Roy's death only to come back to the reality of actually being Morty Smith. \n\nI think this must be a very very pale comparison of Moksha. Once Roy dies, once we achieve Moksha, as you said, we cease to be limited to sentience as we experience it currently and proceed to join into a super sentience.\n\nI don't think that's the same as the Materialist Atheist idea that once we die, nothing happens, I think it's indescribable and beyond words because, as you rightly say, observer and observation are intrinsically linked. I think this also accounts for the retreat from day to day life idea OP expresses, and the evolution idea chakrax puts forward. We see sages retreat not because they have nothing to provide to the world, or even because they want to hide from it, but because once you've played Roy enough times, you realize that you were never Roy, and no amount of playing more Roy is going to make you feel like you're Roy again.

In the Heathen Hel, it's actually the not-so-bad afterlife. Warriors may go to Valhalla or Folkvangar if they're chosen by the Valkyries and die in battle, but most of us who don't do anything militaristic and/or don't have a strong affinity with a certain divinity that would take you into their halls (for instance, there's a myth of Aegir, the Jotunn of the Sea, who would be sacrificed to to slate his hunger and not sink your ship, and his wife Ran, for whom a sailor might carry gold as a token to exchange for entrance into Aegir's Hall as an afterlife).

In this religion, there's a rift between a faction that believes that all Pinks should be doomed to X-Day, while the other faction believes some Pinks should be allowed to board the pleasure saucers as indentured servants. The good, dues-paying SubGeniuses will then take the pleasure saucers to Planet X and leave the world to be sold by JEHOVAH-1, the Alien from a Corporate Sin Galaxy mistaken for many as God, who revealed all of this in the 1950's to J.R. \"Bob\" Dobbs, the world's greatest salesman, while \"Bob\" was making a homemade TV set. If a SubGenius dies before 1998 can get here and goes to Hell, \"Bob\" will meet them at the Gates of Hell to deliver TRIPLE THEIR MONEY BACK, which is why the Church advertises itself with \"ETERNAL SALVATION OR TRIPLE YOUR MONEY BACK\". SubGeniuses have gathered from across the country for decades drilling for X-Day, and X-Day/the X-Day Drill happens every July 5. \n\nThose are the main ones that pop to mind.", "created_utc": "1652476519.0", "edited": "False", "id": "i8i259o", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_uoizjq", "parent_id": "t3_uoizjq", "score": "1", "subreddit": "religion", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh39"}, {"author": "JimiWane", "body": "It's good that you're recognizing where you went wrong here and admitting blame. Mental illness is hard, but you're right, it's not an excuse. This isn't easy, it's hard learned even when you're an adult, but sometimes you just have to take people at their word.\n\nThis sounds a little patronizing, but you're 17. You're very young, just starting to get out into the world as an adult, and honestly, part of that is learning that friendships really aren't forever. Some of them are. Those are fairly rare. But some people stop being friends, some people will just flat out never be friends, and that's okay. \n\nWhat you should do with these two, and I'm sure this isn't the first time you've heard this in this thread, is understand that while you can change your behavior, your outlook, and turn your life around for the better, you can't make them forgive you. You can't make them come back. Not through anything you do to try and accomplish either of those goals.\n\nThe only shot you have at it is what you're already doing. Keep going to therapy, be honest and open with your therapist, realize your issues while you're young and learn what you have to do to cope. To me, it sounds like the way to regain their friendship, if it will happen at all, is nothing less than the self improvement you're already working towards.\n\nForgive yourself. Love yourself. Make peace with yourself. After that, other people will follow when they're ready, because they need to forgive themselves, love themselves, and make peace with themselves too.\n\nGood luck.", "created_utc": "1652472379.0", "edited": "False", "id": "i8hspos", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_uom7mw", "parent_id": "t3_uom7mw", "score": "1", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_id": "t5_2tand"}, {"author": "JimiWane", "body": "I dig it!", "created_utc": "1652462328.0", "edited": "False", "id": "i8h4e5t", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_uosf2p", "parent_id": "t3_uosf2p", "score": "1", "subreddit": "Shamanism", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qieq"}, {"author": "JimiWane", "body": "I love it!
