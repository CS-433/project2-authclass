Maybe ask some bodybuilders what words are essential to body building, translate them (or as someone to translate them), and start learning them.

Just plain tomato sauce.  You can make pasta with pretty much any leftover vegetable tbh. You could make rag\u00f9 or lentils rag\u00f9 although these do take a bit more time, but you can freeze it.\n\nLegumes soups are also a good idea.\n\nI really like lentils and spinach in tomato sauce\n\nYou let some oil heat in a pot as you cut an onion, then you throw the onion in there and let it cook for a little. Next you add the (precooked ) lentils in, salt and pepper to season it a bit, stir a bit, add the tomato sauce and some other spices. I like to put some turmeric, oregano, thyme. If you have fresh spinach you add them in gradually and keep stirring, otherwise you let the sauce cook a bit, taste it and when you like it you add your cooked spinach, give it a quick mix.  Some bread on the side and you have your meal.\n\nIf you don't want to do the onion bit, I reckon you could start with the tomato sauce, add in some onion and garlic powder, and then add the lentils and it would still be good.\n\nBeans burgers / meatballs are something you can make ahead and freeze too. There's recipes online you can play with a bit and find what you like most. I think many recipes call for some beans,  potatoes, flour and spices.
