Usually, that means eating a meal or having happy hour while sitting at the bar, going to a professional networking event, going to a community event, attending a meetup, etc. Set yourself up for success by approaching people in a context where meeting new people is the norm.\n\nConversely, you\u2019ll probably have less success trying to talk to people on public transit, or while walking on a city sidewalk, or shopping at the grocery store. Even social butterflies aren\u2019t interested in making small talk in these situations. It\u2019s also usually not a good idea to try to chat with people who are doing solo activities, like reading a book or working on a laptop.\n\nFor icebreakers, my best advice for getting people talking is to ask an open-ended question. The ones I tend to use are:\n\n- How\u2019s your day going so far?\n- Are you from here or are you visiting? \n- How\u2019s the (insert the name of the food they\u2019re eating if you\u2019re at a bar)?\n- Which team are you rooting for (if you\u2019re watching a game at a bar)?\n- Where do you work (at a networking mixer)?\n- Are you from (town you are in) originally?\n\nPeople love to talk about themselves, and they also love to give other people advice. If someone is visiting from out of town, I like to ask for travel recommendations in their town. I also ask for recommendations for shows on Netflix, etc., and I\u2019ve learned about a bunch of new shows that way.\n\nYou don\u2019t really have to talk much. Just listen. Don\u2019t worry about what you\u2019re going to say in reply, because that will take you away from the conversation. If you don\u2019t know what to say, embrace silence. Usually that means the person you\u2019re talking to will just keep talking, because people don\u2019t like silence so they try to fill it. You can also repeat what the person just said, either reiterating it or reframing it as a question. This is an invitation for them to expand on what they were saying. \n\nDon\u2019t feel like you need to find a story about yourself similar to the one the person you\u2019re talking to is telling. This comes across as trying to one-up someone. Just keep listening and asking follow up questions. You don\u2019t need to say anything about yourself, unless someone asks you a question. Sometimes the best conversations are ones where you just let people talk. Sometimes people are craving the company of someone who will listen.\n\nHave your camera in a conspicuous spot. If asked about it, say you\u2019re taking pictures of people you meet for a project. Ask for a picture if you want to, be okay with hearing no. If they say yes, send it to your phone from your camera so you can airdrop/email it to them on the spot.

That means I\u2019m paid not to miss. Here\u2019s how I do it:\n\n**Start shooting before the moment happens and keep shooting after it\u2019s done**\n\nThis means setting your camera to burst mode. It also might mean upgrading your memory card, because some cards are faster than others. Plus, you need more room for the extra shots. \n\nWhen you review your photos, you\u2019ll start noticing subtle differences in photos during the burst sequence. This gives you feedback about what moment is the exact moment you\u2019re anticipating. From here, you can practice honing your eye to get better results in the moment.\n\n**Turn off the \u201cauto review\u201d setting**\n\nI\u2019m talking about the setting that plays your photo automatically, so you see immediately what you\u2019ve taken. \n\nThis is a distraction, and won\u2019t help your photos. It just gets you in your head and makes you overthink everything. \n\n**Find a lens with good manual controls**\n\nYou may be thinking that I mean you should be using manual focus, and you\u2019re not wrong. But you should also be using manual aperture, because it\u2019s completely game-changing when the scene is rapidly changing. \n\nI combine manual focus and manual aperture with focus peaking. Then I set my shutter to something I know I can handhold, and turn on auto ISO. \n\n**Let go of the idea that great photographers think before they shoot**\n\nThis is gatekeeping, and it\u2019s nonsense. It\u2019s also something I see repeated all the time. \n\nMany beginner photographers experience this ah-ha moment early on, where they realize that taking a second to think about a photo before pressing the shutter results in better photos. \n\nThis is helpful when you make the horizon level, or move the subject so you don't have a tree growing out of their head. \n\nHowever, once you get past the absolute beginner phase thinking too much before you shoot hurts you. \n\nI'm not saying you should mindlessly take photos. Photography is iterative, and you work your way to an awesome shot by taking other shots that don't quite work. At a certain point, shooting and thinking are the same thing. \n\n**Back in the film days photographers only had 36 frames in a roll of film, so every shot had to count**\n\nTo reiterate, this is nonsense. \n\nBack in the film days, professional photographers had to shoot a bunch of rolls of film to get the shot. They ended up spending a lot of money on film. \n\nIf you don't believe me, scope out [famous photographers' contact sheets.](https://hyperallergic.com/256109/see-the-contact-sheets-from-13-legendary-photo-shoots/) They're not all keepers.", "created_utc": "1664503973.0", "edited": "False", "id": "iqg5zxs", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_xr36or", "parent_id": "t3_xr36or", "score": "2", "subreddit": "AskPhotography", "subreddit_id": "t5_2t96o"}, {"author": "caseyjosephine", "body": "I\u2019ve had good luck with a Yashinon 50mm, Sharp and great color accuracy.

We used physically different rolls of film with different speeds for low-light photography. \n\nI\u2019ve always thought about ISO as light sensitivity, but you don\u2019t swap out your digital sensor the same way you swap out film rolls with different speeds. The sensor is physically the same regardless of ISO setting. \n\nI found a more [technical article about ISO](https://photography.tutsplus.com/articles/what-is-iso-a-technical-exploration--photo-11963), and what clarified things for me was understanding full-well capacity. \n\nBriefly, a digital sensor works by converting photons (light) into electrons (charge), which is then converted to voltage. \n\nThink about each pixel in a sensor kind of like a bucket. The light in the scene fills up each bucket with charge. \n\nAt some point, the bucket will be full, resulting in a white pixel. But the camera doesn\u2019t work at its best with completely full buckets, because you lose detail in the highlights. So camera manufacturers stop allowing the photoelectrons to convert to voltage at around 80% of the bucket capacity, to preserve details. \n\nNow you\u2019ll always get noise, because some of the voltage that fills up the buckets is coming from electrons released by heat (not light), or other physical reactions. However, the noise won\u2019t have a big impact on the image because it doesn\u2019t add much to the bucket. Most of the charge in the bucket comes from light. \n\nIf you want to increase the light sensitivity of a sensor, you decrease the size of the bucket. Instead of the camera deciding that the bucket is full at 80% capacity, it will be deemed full at, say, 12% capacity. Now the amount of charge in the bucket due to noise is a larger percentage of the overall amount of charge in the bucket. \n\nI\u2019m going to make up numbers for clarity, but if you imagine that electron noise fills up 4% of the voltage buckets, then at a bigger bucket size where you're aiming for 80% capacity (low ISO), the remaining 76% of electrons are due to light. That means noise is accounting for about 5% of the volume of charge in the buckets. Noise remains constant when you change to a smaller bucket size. When the bucket becomes full at 12% capacity, noise stays at 4% of the bucket, and light fills up the other 8% of the bucket. Now, noise accounts for about 33% of the volume of charge in the bucket. \n\nThis explains where noise comes from when our ISO is high, but it doesn't quite explain why you can't just change the size of the buckets in post. Why can't you tell Lightroom \"12% is now a full bucket\" and get the same result as setting your sensor to have the same threshold?\n\nThe answer lies in the quality of data captured by your sensor, and here we have to recognize that the digital sensor is somewhat analog. This part is super confusing, but bear with me. \n\nCapturing an image where the buckets are deemed full at 12% of their capacity will result in a different dataset than capturing the same image when the buckets are full at 80%. You can test this yourself by shooting the same scene on a tripod with the same aperture and shutter speed, with two different ISOs. \n\nThe lower ISO will result in your camera trying to fill up the buckets past where they should be full. This throws off your calibration at the time of data collection. Your camera doesn't have solid data about the amount of signal amplification required to correctly reproduce your desired dynamic range. \n\n\"But wait!\" you might think. \"If the buckets are getting fuller, aren't they collecting more information? So wouldn't that mean it's better to set ISO low and chance exposure in post?\"\n\nThe answer is no.\n\nImagine you're taking a drone image of a professional football game. Now imagine that you have a special camera with a sensor that sets each person at the game as a pixel, and captures data about each person's annual income. \n\nIf we set our sensor buckets to be full at $250,000 per year, we'd probably get a pretty well exposed image. Median income in the US is around $31,000 per year, and our camera would set those pixel values at 80% grey. \n\nPeople earning over $250,000 per year are generally considered affluent. The top 1% make over $525,000 per year. Our camera would group all these people together as highlights. That means our camera has good sensitivity in collecting data for people in the middle class, but poor sensitivity for those who are affluent.\n\nLet's say we set our buckets to fill up with more money. They now cap out at $50 million, which is the brightest highlight. Relative to the highlights, most of the arena is black. This dynamic range allows us to see the difference between Aaron Rodgers as the brightest highlight and Jimmy Garoppolo at 6.5 million, but the spectators making $250k are just as dark as those making $31k.\n\nIf you bring the first picture into post, your RAW image won't have any recoverable data to discriminate between the highest paid NFL players. For the second image, you wouldn't be able to recover data about the lowest income attendees. \n\nThat's exactly what happens when you set a low ISO in a low-light scene: your sensor collects the best data about the highlights, and compresses data related to the midtones. This results in more noise, because you end up with less relevant data to mess with in post.", "created_utc": "1664256948.0", "edited": "False", "id": "iq2kdht", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_xog591", "parent_id": "t1_iq0iyy9", "score": "1", "subreddit": "photography", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh2a"}, {"author": "caseyjosephine", "body": "It\u2019s not really a light, but white foam board is extremely cheap and works well for fill.

But your definition is as good as any, so I\u2019m going with it.\n\n## Three Dimensional Characters\nThe classic example for me is Leo Tolstoy. *Anna Karenina* is a masterclass in character. *War and Peace* succeeds more for its characters than its dramatic setting.\n\nMore books that scratched that same itch for me:\n* *A Suitable Boy* by Vikram Seth\n* *Middlemarch* by George Eliot\n* *The Signature of All Things* by Elizabeth Gilbert\n* *A Tree Grows in Brooklyn* by Betty Smith\n* *The Farseer Trilogy* by Robin Hobb\n\n\n## Pacing\nFor me, the classic with the best pacing of all time is *The Count of Monte Cristo*. Everyone loves it because it actually /is/ that good.\n \nMore examples:\n* *Gone Girl* by Gillian Flynn\n* *Jurassic Park* by John Grisham\n* *The Martian* by Andy Weir\n* *Into Thin Air* by Jon Krakauer\n* *The DaVinci Code* by Dan Brown (go ahead, fight me)\n* *Emma* by Jane Austen\n* *Rebecca* by Daphne du Maurier \n\nThen again, the slow burn is also a thing. I\u2019d recommend *Lonesome Dove* by Larry McMurtry, \n\n## Thematic\nWhat does it mean to have \u201cpowerful themes?\u201d It probably varies by person, I\u2019ll take it to mean books where themes are central to the storytelling.\n\nGood candidates:\n* *The Great Gatsby* by F. Scott Fitzgerald\n* *Kafka on the Shore* by Haruki Murakami\n* *Love in the time of Cholera* by Gabriel Garcia Marquez\n* *The Bluest Eye* by Toni Morrison\n* *The Edible Woman* by Margaret Atwood\n* *Atonement* by Ian McEwan\n\nBut I think there\u2019s a different kind of thematic book, which I\u2019ll call an immersive thematic book. The kind that pulls you in to a completely different world. \n\nI like these more:\n* *We Have Always Lived in the Castle* by Shirley Jackson\n* *The Haidmaid\u2019s Tale* by Margaret Atwood\n* *Mexican Gothic* by Silvia Moreno-Garcia\n* *State of Wonder* by Ann Patchett\n* *The Poisonwood Bible* by Barbara Kingsolver\n* *The Shining* by Stephen King\n* *The Road* by Cormac McCarthy\n* *Hard-Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World* by Haruki Murakami\n\n## Well Written Dialogue\nThere are two types of well-written dialogue.\n\nThe first type is realistic. I find realistic dialogue rather boring, so I will exclude this type from recommendations.\n\nThe second type is dialogue written the way you wished people spoke. There are many of these that I love:\n\n* *Pride and Prejudice* by Jane Austen\n* *Dracula* by Bram Stoker\n* *The Picture of Dorian Gray* by Oscar Wilde\n* *The Fault in Our Stars* by John Green\n* *The House of Mirth* by Edith Wharton\n* *The Name of the Wind* by Patrick Rothfuss (WARNING: UNFINISHED TRILOGY)\n* *The Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy* by Douglas Adams\n\n## Psychological\nPsychology has to get at something different than your requirement for 3D characters. \n\nSince psychology is the study of the mind, books with psychological storytelling should get inside the head of either the character, or the reader. \n\nI strongly associate psychological books with horror, since a deep delve into the psyche is horrifying. The following books may or may not be horror novels:\n\n* *House of Leaves* by Mark Z. Danielewski\n* *Madame Bovary* by Gustavo Flaubert\n* *The Stranger* by Albert Camus\n* *Invisible Monsters* by Chuck Palahniuk\n* *Lolita* by Vladimir Nabokov\n* *Infinite Jest* by David Foster Wallace\n\n**Edit** I left my slow burn recommendations unfinished!

Theory of mind is an interesting topic, but somewhat controversial within the cognitive sciences.\n\nA ton of the early research on Theory of Mind uses a paradigm called the Sally-Anne task. Here\u2019s how it goes:\n\n- Sally puts her toy in a basket. \n- Sally leaves the room.\n- Anne moved the toy from the basket to a box. \n- Sally comes back. Where does Sally look for the toy?\n\nIf you say \u201cthe basket\u201d you understand that Sally can have a false belief. We know the toy is in the box, not the basket. But Sally does not know this. Young kids have trouble with this task. \n\nHere\u2019s the thing: this sort of task also places demands on memory and inhibitory control, amongst other cognitive processes. So does it really mean that a two year old doesn\u2019t understand that other people have minds? Or is the phenomenon of early failure in child development due to related confounding variables?\n\nMoving slightly to language processing using research methods like the visual world paradigm, we know that neurotypical adult humans also have some difficulty ignoring \u201cprivileged\u201d information. In these studies, they can see items that a conversational partner can\u2019t see. When their eye movements are tracked, they still look to items their interlocutor can\u2019t see. This suggests that inhibiting your perspective to take another person\u2019s perspective is cognitively costly. \n\nSomewhat interestingly, some research suggests that people fail to take another person\u2019s perspective when that other person is similar to them.

Seriously, the relaxation protocol is a two week program to start and is life-changing for training calm. \n\nDriven dogs do learn quickly, and I bet your girl can be trained to accept the harness. Do you have a pre-walking routine? I have my dogs sit and wait before we put their harnesses on, then have them continue to wait at the door until I use their release word.\n\nDon\u2019t be afraid to use treats to train getting the harness on. I don\u2019t work for free, and neither do my dogs. You can phase treats out as the behavior becomes more consistent. \n\nAlso, crate training seems to work best when you feed in the crate. All meals in the crate with the door closed; I\u2019ll put the food down for 15 minutes and then take away what they don\u2019t eat. All good chews are fed only in the crate too. They\u2019ve gotten to the point where they sprint to the crate as soon as they see I have their bowls ready. \n\nFinally, make sure not to give your GSD too much independence. In my experience, this makes them pushy and demanding. I don\u2019t mean any \u201cbe alpha and let them know who\u2019s boss\u201d BS, but don\u2019t let your dog set her own schedule and have firm boundaries so she doesn\u2019t place demands on your time.

This is pretty common in young dogs, my GSD/Husky mix did the same thing. \n\nReverse timeout is the best way to handle it in the moment. The dog needs to learn that biting is not a way to get played with. Leave the room and shut the door for 30 seconds or so. \n\nBeyond that, find an alternative behavior and ask for that instead. We taught our dog to bring us a toy. She has a box filled with toys, and now she will grab one and bring it over to me. This is a more appropriate way to initiate play. \n\nTraining calm is important too, and can be done with crate training/mat training. I like Karen Overall\u2019s relaxation protocol for this. It also helps to give the dog a good chew or puzzle feeder in the crate/while they\u2019re chilling on the mat to reinforce independent mental stimulation. \n\nFinally, a tired dog is a good dog. She\u2019s young, so make sure you don\u2019t overdo it on the exercise, but make sure she\u2019s getting walks in and some good fetch time to tire her out.

In these cases, it\u2019s often better to spend money on a copywriter and photographer first, then use whatever budget is left on a Wordpress template. \n\nOther times, they have no idea what kind of content they need on their website.

The top number is how many beats in a bar, the bottom is what type of note is one beat. \n\n- 4/4 time is the most common time signature, and you\u2019ll encounter it often in pop music. It\u2019s so common it\u2019s also denoted as C (common time).\n- 3/4 time is the waltz time signature. It kind of sounds like \u201cboom she she.\u201d Elliot Smith does a lot of songs in waltz time, and conveniently calls these song waltzes. Some of my favorites in waltz time are In the Aeroplane Over the Sea by Neutral Milk Hotel and Iris by Goo Goo Dolls. \n- Cut time mostly means you\u2019re playing 4/4 time but faster. That\u2019s not quite right, but not quite wrong, and good enough for now. \n- Some songs are in weird time signatures. Money by Pink Floyd is famously in 7/4 time, Hey Ya by Outkast switches to 2/4 for one bar of the chorus, then back to 4/4. It\u2019s important to memorize these so you can annoy your friends with fun facts about songs (they won\u2019t care though).\n\n**Some rhythms sound different.**\n\n- Syncopated rhythms put the accent on the \u201coff\u201d beat. For example, with eight notes you emphasize the \u201cand\u201d instead of the whole number. Reggae is often syncopated.\n- Swung rhythms have uneven pulses to create a different kind of groove. It\u2019s hard to describe, but you\u2019ll recognize it in jazz and funk. \n\n**Do you know how to play drums?** No problem if you don\u2019t; if you want to pick up some basic rhythms you just need to be as good as Meg White and that\u2019s not hard. \n\nIf you know a friend with a drum kit, get them to teach you some basic rhythms. I\u2019m pretty bad at the drums, but learning how to play the bass drum on the 1 beat and the snare on the 3 beat was a big ah-ha moment. \n\n**Do you like to dance?** Dancing is really just feeling the rhythm in your body. Have dance parties at home while no one is watching. Dance around while you clean the house. It gets your heart rate up too!\n\n### Bringing that knowledge to the guitar, I\u2019d recommend:\n\n- Tapping your feet to the beat (the whole numbers in the time signature) while you\u2019re playing\n- Moving your strumming hand in an even timing. This means downstrum on the beat. Different strumming patterns should be created by skipping some of the downstrums and adding some upstrums. In 4/4 time, the downstrums are whole numbers, the upstrums are \u201cands.\u201d\n- Learn Travis picking. This introduces a bass note and helps unlock a better understanding of consistent timing. \n- Get comfortable with palm muting and barre chords. These are a lot of fun when playing rhythm. Jack Johnson uses these techniques often. You can use power chords if you don\u2019t feel like using barre chords. \n- Play standing up. My whole body moves to the rhythm when I play standing up, and my timing is better.\n\nEveryone will tell you to play with a metronome. Do this. But also play to drum tracks, and practice changing the BPM throughout the song for better dynamics.

Prototyping and wire framing are *absolutely* easier to do digitally, at least in my experience. I use XD, and it\u2019s invaluable. Even in the early days (I\u2019m talking 2004-ish), I created mockups using Photoshop. These tools were designed with web design and development in mind, and are superior to paper in every way.\n\nFrom a client-facing perspective, the only thing learn how to draw gets you is the ability to whip out a sketchbook during a client meeting and play around with rough ideas face-to-face. It saves you time\u2014but you could just as easily do this on an iPad pro with an Apple Pencil.\n\nAnyway, **I recommend learning how to draw as an exercise that develops an eye for design**. It\u2019s not about using it as a tool for web design projects; as you\u2019ve mentioned, there are better tools than that.\n\nInstead, learning to draw is the key to unlocking a whole world of visual arts. If you want to paint, most teachers suggest you learn to draw first. Heck, if you want to learn digital painting, most teachers suggest you learn to draw traditionally first. It\u2019s essential for sculpture (and 3d modeling), for architecture (and CAD), and for almost any medium you can think of. \n\nThe more you draw, the better you see. For someone looking to develop their design side, it\u2019s the first thing I would suggest.", "created_utc": "1640291565.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hpq3x6x", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_rmpktc", "parent_id": "t1_hppw5cr", "score": "3", "subreddit": "web_design", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1m"}, {"author": "caseyjosephine", "body": "You\u2019re asking about both CSS and design skills. CSS is the easy part, so I\u2019ll focus on design. \n\n**Drawing - the foundational skill of the digital arts**\n\nDo you draw? Have you ever drawn?\n\nIf you ever liked to draw as a kid, you\u2019re ahead of the curve here! If not, don\u2019t worry, it\u2019s a skill you can learn with some effort. \n\nGrab a sketchbook and some pens or pencils. Draw stuff in it. Don\u2019t overthink it, don\u2019t try too hard to be good. Just draw. \n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a good art book, I like \u201cDrawing on the Right Side of the Brain.\u201d Proko on YouTube is also good. \n\n**Field trips to museums**\n\nGreat artists steal, and museums are rife with ideas for the taking. \n\nIf you\u2019ve got museums locally, visit them. Better yet, become a member so you can visit often. \n\nMy favorite thing to do at the local museums is scope out the special exhibits. These are usually traveling shows that run for a limited amount of time. \n\nBring your sketchbook!\n\n**Gallery openings**\n\nI used to go to gallery openings all the time when I was young and broke because they almost always have free wine. \n\nBeyond that, they\u2019re good for networking. You\u2019ll probably meet local designers, and you\u2019ll certainly meet eccentrics. \n\nPay attention to how the shows are art directed: sometimes the art is bad, but the art direction is great.\n\n**Design is everywhere**\n\nSo engage with it using your favorite media. \n\nLike video games? Read some articles and watch some videos about game design. I steal from games for UI elements all the time.\n\nEnjoy movies? Learn about cinematography and production design. Lookup work by Roger Deakins and Emmanuel Lubezki to get started. \n\nSpend too much time at Home Depot? Interior design goes deeper than you might think, and incorporates color theory, light, texture, and scale. \n\n## TL/DR Think like an artist\n\nArt and technology are interrelated, but as web people we really enjoy geeking out about our tech stacks and IDEs. \n\nIf there\u2019s one takeaway I can give you, it\u2019s to carry around a sketchbook and draw as often as possible.

Japan is crazy safe, so not a worry there, but I could see someone snatching a few thousand dollars worth of kit while taking BART to SFO to get to Japan. For the same reason, I never bring a camera bag, or anything else that suggests that I\u2019m carrying around expensive electronics. \n\nPlus, more than once I\u2019ve had to turn around and take my camera back to the hotel because museums, nightclubs, botanical gardens, and other attractions require permits and fees for professional cameras.\n\n## Japan-specific advice \n\n- **Rear-curtain flash.** Learn it, love it. It allows you to capture ambient light in the background while freezing motion on the subject in the foreground. Great for pictures of your travel buddies at night with the crazy Tokyo neon lights in the background. \n- **Go to Akihabara**, the electronics district in Tokyo, and scope out the camera stuff. Leave room in your suitcase to bring stuff back. \n- **Bring a pistol-grip tripod** for selfies and the occasional video/long exposure shot. Temples and shrines don\u2019t really allow people to setup full-size tripods. \n\nMy biggest travel photo advice is to take fewer wannabe postcard artsy shots, and more snapshots with traveling companions. I\u2019m no longer impressed by my aMaZiNg shots of Kiyomizu-dera, but I cherish the photo of me and my brother getting swarmed by deer in Nara (even though the composition isn\u2019t perfect and it\u2019s not super sharp).", "created_utc": "1625157526.0", "edited": "False", "id": "h3p7288", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_ob6fv2", "parent_id": "t1_h3luy8y", "score": "5", "subreddit": "photography", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh2a"}, {"author": "caseyjosephine", "body": "Scope out the location in advance if you can.\n\nMy process for deciding on settings is to lock in the shutter speed and aperture, then let the camera choose auto ISO and white balance. \n\nAdvice (I shoot events professionally):\n\n- Shooting wide open isn\u2019t always a great idea, as it\u2019s challenging to get more than one person in focus\n- Bounce a flash off the ceiling (Google the black foamie thingy, it\u2019s a great DIY flash mod)\n- Use burst mode (and a fast SD card) so that you can capture the most flattering moments\n- High iso and a sharp picture is better than low iso and a blurry picture", "created_utc": "1625077044.0", "edited": "False", "id": "h3l71vs", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_oasj1h", "parent_id": "t3_oasj1h", "score": "2", "subreddit": "photography", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh2a"}, {"author": "caseyjosephine", "body": "Ended up shooting a couple of events with a failing focus motor last year, I feel your pain. \n\nSpray and pray is pretty stressful when you know you have to deliver images.

I used the jargony term (operationalization) so that you can do further googling. \n\n## Let\u2019s think about putting blurry into numbers\n\nI\u2019ll break down a process I would go through to operationalize your blurriness variable.\n\nFirst, what are you defining as blurry?\n\n- Are you looking at blurred backgrounds? In that case, the in-focus areas could be equally in focus, but a smaller subject would have more background, and thus more blur. That would be easy to tell from focus masking in Photoshop. \n- Do you want to know about the sharpness in the sharp areas? In other words, are you trying to look at the sharpest parts of the picture to determine which is more \u201ctack sharp?\u201d In that case, you can compare the outputs of Photoshop\u2019s high-pass filter, as someone else mentioned. \n\nSecond, how will you compare the two images?\n\n- In the first case, you could look at the total ratio of black to white pixels on the focus mask layer on both images. The one with more black pixels relative to white pixels would have more background blur.\n- In the second case, you could use Photoshop\u2019s average blur to generate an average of your high pass filter layer. Then use the eye dropper tool and look at the percent grey. Sharp areas show up as black, so as the average moves towards black, the image would be sharper. \n- You can combine these by first masking out background blur, then doing a high-pass filter over just the in-focus portion, then averaging that. Or you can subdivide the entire image into smaller blocks of pixels, average those, then use the set of averaged bins as a dataset. \n\n## Remember that it\u2019s easy to lie with data\n\nWith enough statistical know-how, you can pretty much make data say whatever you want. \n\nIn practice, what happens is that we have such a strong gut feeling about a dataset that we try to show that we\u2019re right. That can lead to faulty reasoning. \n\nSo be very clear about the analysis you\u2019d like to do before you collect any data. This is called **a priori** reasoning, and it\u2019s crucial when using quantitative methods. Conversely, waiting to come up with analyses after the fact is **post hoc** and comes with a different set of assumptions. \n\n## Ask for help and collaboration\n\nIf this is an academic project, and you\u2019re associated with a university, go to the Psychology/Neuroscience department. Find a researcher specializing in sensation and perception. Set up a meeting with them. \n\nIn my cognitive science program, we had a ton of arts students sit in on grad level cognition courses. You\u2019d be very welcome! Interdisciplinary research is valuable to everyone involved.\n\nPlus, if you don\u2019t feel like doing the analysis yourself, I\u2019m sure someone else would be happy to be another author on the paper.

Without a tripod, a good rule of thumb is that your images will be shaky at shutter speeds slower than 1/effective focal length. That means at 16mm a lens can be hand held at 1/24 sec (16mm x 1.5 crop factor), but at 200mm you\u2019ll need to be faster than 1/300 sec (200mm x 1.5 crop factor).

I can\u2019t speak for her process, but if I were to replicate it I\u2019d first pick a color palette. She tends to go with a vaperwave aesthetic, using pinks and teals. I\u2019d set the highlights to be pinker, and the shadows to be bluer. Then I\u2019d mess with the tone of the mids until the entire composition is harmonious. You can do this in Lightroom. \n* Masking. She likes to frame a surrealistic landscape within a window. In these compositions, she could have created a mask so that the color grading only applies to the world outside the window. The mask allows you to apply completely different edits to the inside and outside world. This is a job for photoshop.\n* Painting on different colors using blend modes. For the real weird stuff, you can just paint on different colors. Do that on a new layer, then change the blend modes and mess around with the opacity until you find something that works.

I'm so sorry you've been going through that. It must be so frustrating to repeatedly bring up TMJ symptoms without getting any real care.\n\nIt is absolutely not your fault. Most people deal with chronic stress, at least from time to time. Most people do not develop debilitating jaw pain. Also, dealing with jaw issues is insanely stressful.\n\nYou have a couple of great things going for you right now: your dentist is encouraging you to speak up, and may be able to refer other TMJ specialists. And it's fantastic that the antidepressants are making it more manageable.\n\nMy advice is to harness the power of the existing team of healthcare professionals that you've got a good relationship with. Asking for help is powerful. It sounds like the combination of jaw pain, fibromyalgia, and feelings of failure has lead to a personal crisis. Your healthcare team will want to help you get past that.\n\nLosing a stable job of seven years due to changes in your health means something serious is going on. If you're anything like me, you might minimize the impact of your health on your career when you talk to your doctors, especially because losing your job is traumatic. But it's a big deal, and I encourage you to share how deeply the overall situation has impacted your life, because that will lead them to take you more seriously.\n\nMental health is tied to physical health, and any doctor that says something is \"all in your head\" showcases a fundamental lack of understanding about the feedback loop that exists between your body and your mind. In fact, research within psychology suggests that your physiological reactions actually cause changes in emotion and mood. Taking care of the physiological stressors will likely improve your mental health symptoms, like those feelings of failure.\n\nThat means it will be helpful to loop in any counselor you might be seeing. If you're not seeing a counselor, loop in the doctor that prescribed your antidepressants. My counselor is amazing at helping me deal with the healthcare system.\n\nAlso, this is a weird piece of advice, but wearing a suit to doctor's appointments seems to get me better care. I'm female, and I've had so many doctors not take me seriously (or brush off actual medical issues as anxiety).

More importantly, it helps me pay better attention by allowing me to illustrate and doodle (probably an ADHD thing). I use Notability for this.\n\n**Taking notes while networking** I'm in the wine trade. In the before times, I did a ton of industry tastings for networking/outreach. Using Notability (again), I keep track of wines I tasted and add (and annotate) pictures of the bottles/ tasting room/production facility/ vineyards. Writing is better than typing on the iPad (seems overly formal) or iPhone (seems dismissive). These used to live in physical notebooks, but after some drunk bitch spilled red wine all over my moleskine I wanted a better backup system.\n\n**Photo editing** Lightroom on iPadOS is great for travel photos, personal photos, and those times when I can't (or don't want to) sit at my desk. The pencil gives me finer control over the tone curve, selective edits, color grading, and so much more.\n\n**More photo editing** I find Affinity Photo to be a great alternative to Photoshop on the iPad. If I need to do some Photoshop work on the fly, the pencil plus Affinity Photo does the job.\n\n**Even more photo editing** When I'm doing more complex work in Photoshop on my Mac, I connect with Sidecar and use the Apple Pencil, somewhat like a Wacom tablet.\n\n**Drawing** Procreate is a killer app on the iPad and worth the cost of the pencil if you like to draw. It feels like a sketchbook. Also, the pencil is cheaper than oil paint, watercolors, fancy colored pencils, canvases, paper, calligraphy nibs, and all the art supplies that you'll probably still buy anyway, let's be real.\n\n**Annotating** Annotating is great, and it's not just for academic work. For example, in Safari you can save full-page screenshots as PDFs, which you can markup and then store on Dropbox. \n\n**Scribble** It's great, and sometimes infuriating at the same time.", "created_utc": "1611539344.0", "edited": "False", "id": "gkntgj0", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_l41h4i", "parent_id": "t3_l41h4i", "score": "5", "subreddit": "ipad", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rgny"}, {"author": "caseyjosephine", "body": "The Sigma 105 is one I\u2019m really intrigued by.

They don\u2019t need advanced tech or software, since it\u2019s cheaper to get it right in camera than to fix it in post. Instead, they\u2019re using a combination of careful lighting and exposure to visually smooth out the green screen.\n\nFirst, realize that the top picture isn\u2019t a reflection of what the video camera was shooting. It\u2019s also not actually exposed properly: you can see that the highlights on his back are blown, and there\u2019s not much detail in the shadows either. Clearly taken from a wide angle with an aperture around f/8 or f/11, I suspect camera phone. \n\nThe shot from the film shows soft lighting coming from above and slightly to the right. I\u2019d guess there\u2019s a big light source above him, with a rim light behind him and some sort of fill slightly below and to the left. \n\nBecause the lighting on him is soft and diffuse, he will be relatively more well lit, while the green screen is slightly thrown into shadow. The green screen likely does have some soft lighting on it too, but not the same amount. \n\nTo keep the lighting different for the subject and the green screen, they\u2019re likely flagging the lights on him to keep them from spilling onto the green screen (and vice versa). This can be done in lots of different ways.\n\nThe depth of field is shallow on him, meaning that they\u2019re shooting at a fairly open aperture. This will keep him in focus while blurring out the background, eliminating much of the details in the green screen behind him. \n\nNow, you might be wondering how they can use such a fast lens on such a well-lit scene without it getting over exposed. Likely, they\u2019re also using neutral density filters to let less light into the lens, allowing for proper exposure at a wide aperture. \n\nFinally, they\u2019re shooting in a different color profile. If you take photos with a DSLR, mirrorless camera, or higher-end phone, you might be familiar with RAW files, which are fairly flat when taken out of camera. These photos contain more information and are unprocessed, meaning they can be edited after exposure without losing quality. Same here: the video is the equivalent of a ton of raw images that are adjusted and color-graded in post. The sheer amount of information in the digital file does make them easier to chroma key. \n\nI hope that makes some sense!

It was a HUGE blow to my self esteem because it was totally out of the blue.\n\nA decent company will give you a number of official warnings before letting you go for performance. \n\nTypically, the process starts with a verbal warning. From there, you'll get an official write up along with a more formal discussion. Once it's been documented the company has covered their ass enough to let you go if it happens again, but some give more chances. \n\n> Just to note before I got sacked, no-one had mentioned my ability/ skills. \n\nIf you're serious about your career and you want to grow professionally, you need to prioritize working for companies that will give you honest feedback. And you're going to need to self-advocate here.\n\nAs much as it sucks to hear, most managers don't enjoy evaluating their employees because it's awkward and time-consuming. It's common to rush through working an annual review because there are other things that need to be done that seem more important.\n\nInstead of waiting for a formal review process, I ask for specific feedback on the regular.

My instinct was to avoid overselling what our team can do, because I'd rather underpromise and overdeliver, but maybe they want to be sold on a best case scenario. How would you have approached this pitch?\" \n\nPro tip: if you get specific, positive feedback from one of these discussions, write it down in your notes.

Your more experienced coworkers may be willing to mentor you, but professional development is something you are fully responsible for.\n\nComing from academia, this is strange because academics are all about training within a formal structure. But companies exist to make money, and they'll only train you if they think it will make them more money.\n\nIf someone in your company is particularly good at a particular task, you can get the best training by asking them to share their process with you. They'll feel good (because people love to give advice and feel like important founts of information), and you'll get proven, pragmatic advice.\n\n> I achieved a first in my masters, but the key software used in companies is very technical, and I naturally struggle.\n\nIt doesn't matter if you got a first if you aren't able to do the technical tasks you're getting paid for.\n\nThat sucks to hear, but remember that they're paying you to use this software, not write an essay on the big-picture ideas related to the problems that this software solves. \n\nYour first is an important achievement that you should be proud of. Now, your priority is to get good at whatever pays the bills.\n\n> I'm actually devasted. I loved Landscape Architecture, but I feel so let down.

While both Fresno and San Bernardino County narrowly went for Clinton, they have historically been more conservative areas in the state of California. In fact, part of California\u2019s 22nd district, represented by Devin Nunes (R), is in Fresno County.\n\nAs someone who was born in Los Angeles and raised in San Bernardino County, it shocks me to hear the rhetoric that California is a totally blue state, and there aren\u2019t Republicans here. The fact is that **[California is home to 4.7 million registered Republicans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_locations_by_voter_registration?wprov=sfti1).**\n\nTo put that into context, **there are more *registered Republicans* in California than there are *people* in over half of the states in the United States**. The states (etc) with a lower population than the number of registered Republicans in California are:\n\n* States: Louisiana, Kentucky, Oregon, Oklahoma, Connecticut, Utah, Iowa, Nevada, Arkansas, Mississippi, Kansas, New Mexico, Nebraska, West Virginia, Idaho, Hawaii, New Hampshire, Maine, Montana, Rhode Island, Delaware, South Dakota, North Dakota, Alaska, Vermont, Wymoing \n* Etc: Puerto Rico, the District of Columbia, Guam, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Northern Mariana Islands, and American Samoa\n\nCalifornia conservatives tend to differ from conservatives in other states. While I\u2019m quite liberal, I grew up around many Californians with more conservative viewpoints, and I\u2019ve had quite a lot of interesting political discussions with them. The following are my *anecdotal* experiences, based on growing up in a rural part of San Bernardino County and currently working in an agricultural area:\n\n* Gun rights tend to be a major issue for conservative Californians. Rural areas, especially, are home to people who purchase guns for personal protection. California is a state with a ton of wildlife, and it\u2019s not uncommon to see coyotes, bobcats, bears, and even mountain lions on personal property. Even my Berniecrat parents had my brother and I doing target practice with BB guns, and kept a shotgun around for bears. There\u2019s a huge rural/urban divide here, as people who experience gang violence in cities tend to want more gun control. There are also more liberal gun owners around here than one might think.\n* Cost of living is the biggest problem in California, with homeowners benefiting from the year-over-year increases in their home values while the rest of us pay more and more in rent and continue to be priced out of the market. Conservatives often attribute the high cost of living to the increased tax burden in California, and believe that cutting taxes will make California more affordable. Liberals blame lack of affordable housing, especially in high population density areas. Speaking for myself, I believe that repealing [Prop 13](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1978_California_Proposition_13?wprov=sfti1), which allows homeowners to benefit from equity gains while never being taxed on the true market value of their homes, and easing some of the insane restrictions on development (e.g., allowing for more high-rise apartment buildings rather than giving preferential treatment to single family homes) would help. But views on taxation are, unsurprisingly, at an impasse here.\n* Rural California suffers disproportionately from the opioid epidemic, which has not been adequately addressed by the state nor federal government. Being there for one of my best buddies in high school while we buried his 16-year-old little sister was one of the most difficult experiences in my life. Helping my younger brother pull himself out of addiction and stay clean has been devastatingly hard. Politicians don\u2019t seem to care.\n* Immigration is a complicated problem. There\u2019s not quite as much xenophobia here, as (mostly Mexican) immigrants are our friends, neighbors, and, sometimes, coworkers. Some conservatives feel that competition from low-paid immigrant workers keeps salaries lower, decreases the demand for jobs that could be filled by Americans, and results in a viscous cycle of even more illegal immigration. I don\u2019t necessarily disagree, although I believe that the problem could be better solved by increasing the consequences for companies that hire illegal immigrants at below-market wages combined with an easier route to citizenship, rather than stopping people from coming here. Additionally, decriminalizing harder drugs could potentially decrease damage caused by cartels in Mexico.\n* There are definitely the wealthy \u201cfuck you, I\u2019ve got mine\u201d types around here. Orange County is notorious for them, but they live elsewhere too. They hate traffic, growth, change, and the innovation that has made California wealthy. They are harder to talk to.\n\nInterestingly, religion is way different in California, and I encounter fewer religiously motivated conservatives. We have about equal proportions of Protestants (30%), Catholics (28%), and people who are not religious (27%). [Source](https://www.pewforum.org/religious-landscape-study/state/california/).\n\nAnyway, **it\u2019s clear to me that the mainstream GOP talking points don\u2019t speak to the issues that California conservatives care about**. Sure, it\u2019s a consequence of the electoral college and the fact that empty land has more representation in Congress than actual people, but that doesn\u2019t make it less real. The GOP should tread lightly, because they\u2019re losing support here in California. And the Democratic Party should take the lead from people like Andrew Yang, who openly speaks to how his policies could address the problems that made many conservatives begrudgingly vote for Trump in the first place.", "created_utc": "1602860536.0", "edited": "1602860821.0", "id": "g90anlq", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_jc7cka", "parent_id": "t1_g8zm8be", "score": "1", "subreddit": "politics", "subreddit_id": "t5_2cneq"}, {"author": "caseyjosephine", "body": "As someone with ADHD, I\u2019m curious what that felt like.

Finding common ground is critical, and beyond just reminding my family members that I love them, I also try to truly listen to them and understand where they\u2019re coming from.\n\nIt can be infuriating, honestly. Part of me wants to pick an argument, because it\u2019s hard for me to recognize that anyone could deny the logic of intellectual arguments I\u2019ve absorbed from reading Christopher Hitchens, and Richard Dawkins, and Bertrand Russell, and not be convinced to stop clinging to hokey beliefs about fictitious sky daddies.

But there\u2019s not going to be much to differentiate you from the hundreds of other candidates from similar universities with similar backgrounds applying for similar jobs.\n\nThere are two places you can truly rise above the competition: the cover letter, and your people skills. I\u2019ve hired people before, and while I certainly care a little bit about qualifications and experience for entry-level, it\u2019s more important to me that someone knows what my company does and truly wants to work with us. A candidate that successfully connects with both the company mission and me on a personal level is the one that will get the job offer.\n\nHow to Win Friends and Influence People sounds like a manipulative title, but it\u2019s honestly a book about connecting with other people.

These ideas sound super basic, but they\u2019re also incredibly powerful. They absolutely helped me go from completely clueless grad student to a top performer in my career (sales). And, as a bonus, they\u2019ll help you in your relationships as well.\n\nBeyond that, I encourage you to read nonfiction widely, and voraciously. Being a curious person means you\u2019ll have a bevy of conversational topics available to you as you start networking, and networking will get you more opportunities than any resume workshop. Managers are people too, and they like to hire people who are interesting. They know they\u2019ll be spending more time with their team than they\u2019ll spend with their spouse or children.

Because I\u2019m often not hungry for lunch, I usually fast until dinner and eat between 6:00 PM and 9:00 PM on weekdays, with a longer eating period on weekends. \n\nIt\u2019s especially great for those of us with ADHD who take stimulant medications, because they make food taste like cardboard and kill appetite. By dinner, my medication has worn off and I\u2019m able to actually enjoy food. I try to make my dinners from scratch, from seasonal ingredients, focusing on sustainably raised meat and vegetables. But when that\u2019s too much work, I make a cheese plate for dinner.

It honestly helps to hyperfocus on cooking techniques, but of course it\u2019s hard to control hyperfocus. \n\nTry not to buy a bunch of stuff at the grocery store because ADHD makes it hard to meal plan. It\u2019s best to buy what you need for the next couple days. It\u2019s harder to do in a pandemic, and honestly I\u2019m struggling.\n\nTry to figure out equations for food. Like pan roasted $meat with roasted $vegetable. One day you might roast chicken with zucchini, another day spicy Italian sausage with potatoes, and on a third day you could do a pork loin with Brussels sprouts. \n\nIf your fridge turns into a black hole of despair like mine, invest in see-through Tupperware, masking tape, and a box of sharpies. That way you can see your leftovers, and you can date and label them to help you do detective work. I only manage to date and label like 40% of the time but even that helps. \n\nThe freezer is great for leftovers because things don\u2019t go bad in there. I buy ziploc bags and put single servings in those and freeze them. My freezer is also a black hole of despair but at least things aren\u2019t rotting in there. \n\nIf you find yourself able to make a meal a couple times, try to get the stuff for all the time. At the store everything seems fun and you might buy harissa and strange dried mushrooms and sun hikes, but the effort to figure out what to do with those ingredients can make follow through hard. \n\nSpending more money on quality ingredients can be great because you just need salt and pepper. A $13 ribeye might seem more expensive than chicken curry, but if you can\u2019t figure out how to get the rice cooked while saut\u00e9ing all the aromatics and simmering the chicken in curry then throwing away all the chicken curry ingredients is pricier than splurging on the ribeye that you just need to cook in a hot pan for a few minutes. \n\nLikewise, there\u2019s no shame in buying pre-prepped ingredients. I like to buy shredded carrots, shredded cabbage, precut fruit, and rotisserie chicken.
