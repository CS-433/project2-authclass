You're completely textbook. I'm not really sure what you're confused about, tbh.\n\nYou'll get a lot more responses and commiseration on /r/ftm and /r/transteens, FYI.\n\nDysphoria doesn't necessarily mean you're miserable or you hate your body or you can't stand the idea of living as a girl. For a lot of people it's a whole lot more subtle than that. \"I wouldn't mind staying a girl, but I'd rather be a guy\" is dysphoria. \"I wish I had dysphoria because then I could transition\" is dysphoria. [Cis girls would not rather be guys](https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/4hgcp8/cisgender_people_what_happens_when_you_question/). They actively *like* being girls. They aren't just settling for it because they're stuck with it. The point isn't that we're all miserable tortured souls who hate our bodies and want to die every time we're misgendered. If something different sounds like an improvement to you, that is a manifestation of dysphoria.\n\nRemember that \"transition is scary and seems daunting\" is not why cis people don't want to transition.\n\nTrans with doubts doesn't equal cis.\n\nTrans and terrified doesn't equal cis.\n\nTrans with depression doesn't equal cis.\n\nTrans with impostor syndrome (google it) doesn't equal cis.\n\nTrans with shitty self-esteem doesn't equal cis.\n\nTrans with internalized Transphobia doesn't equal cis.\n\nRead [The Null Hypothecis](https://freethoughtblogs.com/nataliereed/2012/04/17/the-null-hypothecis/) and [That Was Dysphoria?](http://freethoughtblogs.com/zinniajones/2013/09/that-was-dysphoria-8-signs-and-symptoms-of-indirect-gender-dysphoria/) I think they'll both speak to you a lot.\n\nForget doubting whether you should transition. Doubt whether you *shouldn't* transition. What if you regret not transitioning, or not transitioning sooner? (Spoiler: that's way more likely than regretting transition.) Take every scared \"what if\" question and change \"transition\" to \"not transition\". What if, by not transitioning, you screw up the rest of your life? What if you don't transition and you're never happy later in life? If all those fears can be used against transition, they can equally be used in favor of it.\n\nDon't angst about being 100% sure. You do NOT have to be 100% sure to act on your feelings, and there's loads of non-permanent things you can do. I'm guessing that you think if you come out as Trans you have to do ALL THE TRANSITION THINGS and there is NO GOING BACK and you have to be VERY VERY 110% SURE or else BAD THINGS WILL HAPPEN and you will be MISERABLE FOREVER. None of this is true. Transition is a process, not an event. Just do whatever you need to do to feel as comfortable as possible in your own skin and in the world as you move through it. That's the entire point; the rest is noise. Transition is not a roller coaster you strap yourself onto. *You* are in charge. Try stuff out, keep what works, chuck what doesn't. That's really all there is to it. That doesn't mean you have to have surgery or live as a guy or anything else. If you want to be seen as a guy, put yourself into social situations as a guy, whether online or offline. If you want to try binding, try binding (safely!). If you want to try packing, try packing. If you want to try wearing jeans from the men's department, go get a pair of jeans. If you want this or that surgery, go for it. If you want to take T, take T. If you want to stop taking T later, stop taking it. If you want to go back *on* T later still, do that. Etc.\n\nRead *The Transgender Teen* by Stephanie Brill and Lisa Kenney and *Where's MY Book?* by Linda Gromko. It'll help you a lot.

Your job is to trust your kid and not be dismissive - and requiring evidence or an explanation that satisfies you counts as being dismissive. It sends a profoundly unsupportive message to your kid and it makes it far more likely that they won't want to tell you anything further, even if you directly ask. Honestly you need to run damage control here, apologize to your kid, and be clear that you're completely fine with them being non-binary and will support them no matter what. And then you need to walk your talk. [Support for Trans youth matters.](http://www.transstudent.org/youthsupport) Support doesn't mean saying \"I support you\" and then not letting them wear the clothes they want to an upcoming family event, or not using their name and/or pronouns, or telling them they should wait to pursue medical transition. That isn't support. If they don't *feel* supported, they're in the stat group of unsupported youth.\n\nBeing questioning is a thing. Exploring is a thing, and is really important to do. The fact that they aren't sure doesn't mean they aren't non-binary or are just copying their friends. They may have also said they're unsure because they were trying to gauge your reaction first (this is extremely common, particularly for kids and teens who still live at home). Your response will have sent the message that saying firmly \"I'm non-binary\" isn't a good idea.\n\nA preteen saying that they're non-binary just because their friends are is not a problem. If that's all this is, trust me when I say it won't last; and if it lasts, that's not all this is. Frankly I'd bet good money on that not being all this is.

A cis boy who's been in puberty for six weeks is literally not even aware he's in puberty, because nothing he'd notice has happened. A cis boy who's been in puberty for five months is still 12 or 13. He doesn't look or sound like an adult man and he isn't supposed to. He will in time, but he doesn't yet. A cis boy who's been in puberty for three *years* is about 15; he doesn't look or sound like a child, but he doesn't look or sound like an adult man yet either. T doesn't care how old you chronologically are; you have to go through all of puberty just like cis guys do. It sucks, but patience is a virtue. You'll get there, I promise. :)\n\nThe very best thing you can do on T is forget about it. Go about your life, stay busy, and let puberty run its course. It takes a decade, not a year. You are going to drive yourself crazy if you sit around angsting about when this is going to happen and why that hasn't happened yet. As long as your hormone levels are within the healthy range for a male of your age, you're fine.", "created_utc": "1637587453.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hlmw3le", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_qzbbwa", "parent_id": "t1_hllrjnv", "score": "1", "subreddit": "trans", "subreddit_id": "t5_2shbb"}, {"author": "ftmichael", "body": "Look at baby name lists from the year you were born.\n\nAnd try stuff out.

Relax, you'll be fine. You'll go through puberty like everyone else.\n\nAnd because it is very important to understand this:\n\nPeople tend to expect that pretty soon after they go on T, they'll start to look and sound like a man of their own age. That's not how T works. You have to go through puberty - all of it - and that takes time. Think about cis boys going through puberty. A cis boy who's been in puberty for six weeks is literally not even aware he's in puberty, because nothing he'd notice has happened. A cis boy who's been in puberty for five months is still 12 or 13. He doesn't look or sound like an adult man and he isn't supposed to. He will in time, but he doesn't yet. A cis boy who's been in puberty for three *years* is about 15; he doesn't look or sound like a child, but he doesn't look or sound like an adult man yet either. T doesn't care how old you chronologically are; you have to go through all of puberty just like cis guys do. It sucks, but patience is a virtue. You'll get there, I promise. :)\n\nThe very best thing you can do on T is forget about it. Go about your life, stay busy, and let puberty run its course. It takes a decade, not a year.

A cis boy who's been in puberty for six weeks is literally not even aware he's in puberty, because nothing he'd notice has happened. A cis boy who's been in puberty for five months is still 12 or 13.

T doesn't care how old you chronologically are; you have to go through all of puberty just like cis guys do. It sucks, but patience is a virtue. You'll get there, I promise. :)\n\nThe very best thing you can do on T is forget about it. Go about your life, stay busy, and let puberty run its course. It takes a decade, not a year.

What's not talked about a lot is that the way things are at a year, or two years, or four years, is not the way they're going to stay forever. It's puberty. It takes a decade.\n\nNo negative changes; just some changes I didn't especially want. Same as for everyone else, Trans or cis. Again, it's puberty, not magic.\n\nPeople tend to expect that pretty soon after they go on T, they'll start to look and sound like a man of their own age. That's not how T works. You have to go through puberty - all of it - and that takes time. Think about cis boys going through puberty. A cis boy who's been in puberty for six weeks is literally not even aware he's in puberty, because nothing he'd notice has happened. A cis boy who's been in puberty for five months is still 12 or 13. He doesn't look or sound like an adult man and he isn't supposed to. He will in time, but he doesn't yet. A cis boy who's been in puberty for three /years/ is about 15; he doesn't look or sound like a child, but he doesn't look or sound like an adult man yet either. T doesn't care how old you chronologically are; you have to go through all of puberty just like cis guys do. It sucks, but patience is a virtue. You'll get there, I promise. :)\n\nThe very best thing you can do on T is forget about it. Go about your life, stay busy, and let puberty run its course. It takes a decade, not a year.

I have never been stealth and never will be.\n\nLong answer:\n\nI've never wanted to be stealth - not when I was first coming out, not as I made my way through my transition, and not now that I'm several years post-transition. Stealth is another closet for me and holds zero appeal. I'm not interested in spending one nanosecond of my life looking over my shoulder or worrying about what this or that person would think/say/do if they knew. Everyone in my life knows. If they have a problem with it, they can exit, pursued by a bear. That said, it's never been an issue. No, people haven't started misgendering me or slipping up on pronouns - or, for that matter, suddenly asking personal or invasive questions - once they find out I'm Trans. What usually happens is that they forget, to be honest. I took a month off work for my hysto, and when I said I was having a hysterectomy, I got very confused looks for a few seconds before they both went \"... ohhhhhhhh. Right.\" :D Nobody treats me differently, nobody is weird about it - frankly, nobody cares. What we think of as massive, troublesome, all-consuming information is completely uninteresting to most people, because they are just plain not that interested in you. They're far more interested in themselves. I hear this over and over and over again from people who came out, thought it would be SUCH a huge deal, and found that basically nobody gave a shit - or they gave a shit for about a week, and then forgot about it because something else to talk about came along. And coming out later in or after transition is very different from coming out prior to or earlier in transition.\n\nThe one time I was stealth was for a two-week trip around the southwest US with my family, because we were going through a lot of small conservative towns and it was a safety concern. All that meant is I didn't bring any of my T-shirts that had Trans or queer stuff on them, and left my baseball cap that says TRANSBOY at home. (I have a Trans symbol tattooed on my forearm, but I knew that no one would know what it meant, which was also something I kept in mind when I originally got the tattoo: I wanted something that folks in the know would recognize, and clueless bigots likely wouldn't. Because safety.) I was still very acutely aware of it, and really hated that I had to be conscious of that for the sake of my and my family's safety. At all times, keep the safety of yourself and your loved ones in mind, and do whatever you need to do to stay safe. Stealth for safety reasons feels like a completely different issue and discussion to me; I know a lot of people around the world are stealth 24/7 because to do anything else just plain isn't safe.\n\nWhen I was early in transition, I thought that I was non-binary, because I like being Trans. There were no examples, anywhere that I could find, of binary Trans people who did not hate being Trans, desperately wish they were cis, and work very hard to be as stealth as possible. We used to say that the goal of transition was to disappear. (When folks who didn't want to be stealth, who weren't straight, who were non-binary, or who in other ways didn't fit the \"transsexual\" diagnosis we had to get in order to access medical transition, started more openly and vocally criticizing the gatekeeping models that providers were using, that became a big part of the criticism: access to transition was only allowed, by these cis people, to Trans people who promised they would then disappear.) The non-binary people I encountered, conversely, celebrated their Transness and didn't appreciate being told that Trans people are supposed to SUFFER and that there was something wrong with them because they liked being Trans. That resonated very strongly with me. Turns out that I'm not non-binary at all; I'm just a dude, quite a boring dude in fact, and happy that way. And I'm still Trans, and feel most authentic when people know that about me, just like I feel most authentic when they know I'm queer, when they know I'm a massive nerd, etc. (Holy fuck I am LIVING for that Doctor Who news that just broke.) It's just one more thing about me, but it matters - if you don't know this thing about me, you don't know me. So I'm forging my own path when it comes to that stuff. And I always really love connecting with Trans folks, especially folks later in transition or post-transition, who aren't stealth and have no desire to be. I even [made a Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/posttransitionandhappilyout/) \\- if it sounds like your kind of space, please come join!\n\nTo those who are or want to be out: anyone who gives you shit - and hyper-defensive stealth people exist, and can get very vocal about how your existence as a Trans person who prefers not to be stealth is somehow automatically stealth-shaming them - is not worth your time. People giving you shit for existing authentically, no matter what it's about, are always coming from a place of insecurity. Pity them if you like, but don't waste time or energy on actually caring what they think. Just walk away. The good news is that like a lot of shitty people, they're not actually the majority, they're just loud. You can ignore them and still have access to lots of Trans people who *aren't* completely insecure.\n\nAs for the eternal \"But then I'd have to answer QUESTIONS!\" argument, which I hear constantly: No. You don't. People may *ask* questions, although you will be very surprised at how few questions you get, but I have a really interesting and apparently little-known fact for you: Just because someone asks you a question does not mean you are required to answer it. Being out, even very very out, does not mean you have to be people's walking encyclopedia. There are a million ways to shut down personal or invasive questioning without being a dick and without actually giving information you don't want to share, or don't have the energy to discuss in that moment.\n\nThe \"it's nobody's business\" argument also wears me out, because it completely misses the point. We don't come out because it's people's business or because we \"owe\" them that information. That is not why anybody is out and open about their Transness.\n\nWe live in a world where we are expected at all times to feel, and be treated, like broken cis people. We are constantly and consistently given the message that cis is real and Trans is fake, cis is valid and Trans is not, cis is good and Trans is bad. My Transness does not have any effect on the validity or depth of my manhood; anyone who thinks it does isn't even worth the time or energy it would take to invite them to go fuck themselves. It's just a fact about me, like any other, and anyone worth my time is going to be cool with *all* of me. I'm post-transition and no longer dysphoric, but I will never be cis, by virtue of the pure fact of my birth and experiences. And that isn't a bad thing. Cis genders, cis bodies, and cis lives are not inherently more valuable or more valid than Trans bodies and genders and lives. I come back a lot to Janet Mock saying \"I think there\u2019s a lot of power in saying that I will proudly and unapologetically embrace that part of my identity ... the one part of my identity that I was taught growing up to be silent and shamed about.\"\n\nAuthenticity is, ultimately, the entire point of transition, and your job as a human being is to live your truth as fully as possible and be as authentic as you can as you move through the world. For me, checking part of myself at the door - any part of myself - is not how to be authentic.", "created_utc": "1632499670.0", "edited": "1632500127.0", "id": "he3u0ck", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_pulil6", "parent_id": "t3_pulil6", "score": "1", "subreddit": "trans", "subreddit_id": "t5_2shbb"}, {"author": "ftmichael", "body": "Being *early in transition* can be hard.

That's not how T works. You have to go through puberty - all of it - and that takes time. Think about cis boys going through puberty. A cis boy who's been in puberty for six weeks is literally not even aware he's in puberty, because nothing he'd notice has happened. A cis boy who's been in puberty for ten months is still 12 or 13. He doesn't look or sound like an adult man and he isn't supposed to. He will in time, but he doesn't yet. A cis boy who's been in puberty for three *years* is about 15; he doesn't look or sound like a child, but he doesn't look or sound like an adult man yet either. T doesn't care how old you chronologically are; you have to go through all of puberty just like cis guys do. It sucks, but patience is a virtue. You'll get there, I promise. :)\n\nThe very best thing you can do on T is forget about it. Go about your life, stay busy, and let puberty run its course. It takes a decade, not a year.

For a lot of people it's a whole lot more subtle than that. \"I wouldn't mind staying a girl, but I'd rather be a boy\" is dysphoria. \"I wish I had dysphoria because then I could transition\" is dysphoria. [Cis girls would not rather be boys](https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/4hgcp8/cisgender_people_what_happens_when_you_question/). They actively *like* being girls. They aren't just settling for it because they're stuck with it. The point isn't that we're all miserable tortured souls who hate our bodies and want to die every time we're misgendered.

Doubt whether you *shouldn't* transition. What if you regret not transitioning, or not transitioning sooner? (Spoiler: that's way more likely than regretting transition.) Take every scared \"what if\" question and change \"transition\" to \"not transition\". What if, by not transitioning, you screw up the rest of your life? What if you don't transition and you're never happy later in life? If all those fears can be used against transition, they can equally be used in favor of it.\n\nDon't angst about being 100% sure. You do NOT have to be 100% sure to act on your feelings, and there's loads of non-permanent things you can do. I'm guessing that you think if you come out as Trans you have to do ALL THE TRANSITION THINGS and there is NO GOING BACK and you have to be VERY VERY 110% SURE or else BAD THINGS WILL HAPPEN and you will be MISERABLE FOREVER. None of this is true. Transition is a process, not an event. Just do whatever you need to do to feel as comfortable as possible in your own skin and in the world as you move through it. That's the entire point; the rest is noise. Transition is not a roller coaster you strap yourself onto. *You* are in charge. Try stuff out, keep what works, chuck what doesn't. That's really all there is to it. That doesn't mean you have to have surgery or live as a boy or anything else. If you want to be seen as a boy, put yourself into social situations as a boy, whether online or offline. If you want to try binding, try binding (safely!). If you want to try packing, try packing. If you want to try wearing jeans from the men's department, go get a pair of jeans. If you want this or that surgery, go for it. If you want to take T, take T.

I've always loved being Trans and always will. We're not broken cis people.\n\nWhen I was early in transition, I thought that I was non-binary, because I like being Trans. There were no examples, anywhere that I could find, of binary Trans people who did not hate being Trans, desperately wish they were cis, and work very hard to be as stealth as possible. We used to say that the goal of transition was to disappear. (When folks who didn't want to be stealth, who weren't straight, who were non-binary, or who in other ways didn't fit the \"transsexual\" diagnosis we had to get in order to access medical transition, started more openly and vocally criticizing the gatekeeping models that providers were using, that became a big part of the criticism: access to transition was only allowed, by these cis people, to Trans people who promised they would then disappear.) The non-binary people I encountered, conversely, celebrated their Transness and didn't appreciate being told that Trans people are supposed to SUFFER and that there was something wrong with them because they liked being Trans. That resonated very strongly with me. Turns out that I'm not non-binary at all; I'm just a dude, quite a boring dude in fact, and happy that way. And I'm still Trans, and feel most authentic when people know that about me, just like I feel most authentic when they know I'm queer, when they know I'm a massive nerd, etc. It's just one more thing about me, but it matters - if you don't know this thing about me, you don't know me. So I'm forging my own path when it comes to that stuff. And I always really love connecting with Trans folks, especially folks later in transition or post-transition, who aren't stealth and have no desire to be. I even [made a Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/posttransitionandhappilyout/) - if it sounds like your kind of space, please come join!\n\nWe live in a world where we are expected at all times to feel, and be treated, like broken cis people. We are constantly and consistently given the message that cis is real and Trans is fake, cis is valid and Trans is not, cis is good and Trans is bad. My Transness does not have any effect on the validity or depth of my manhood; anyone who thinks it does isn't even worth the time or energy it would take to invite them to go fuck themselves. It's just a fact about me, like any other, and anyone worth my time is going to be cool with *all* of me. I'm post-transition and no longer dysphoric, but I will never be cis, by virtue of the pure fact of my birth and experiences. And that isn't a bad thing. Cis genders, cis bodies, and cis lives are not inherently more valuable or more valid than Trans bodies and genders and lives.

You have to go through puberty - all of it - and that takes time. Think about cis boys going through puberty. A cis boy who's been in puberty for six weeks is literally not even aware he's in puberty, because nothing he'd notice has happened. A cis boy who's been in puberty for ten months is still 12 or 13. He doesn't look or sound like an adult man and he isn't supposed to. He will in time, but he doesn't yet.

If something different sounds like an improvement to you, that is a manifestation of dysphoria.\n\nRemember that \"transition is scary and seems daunting\" is not why cis people don't want to transition.\n\nTrans with doubts doesn't equal cis.\n\nTrans and terrified doesn't equal cis.\n\nTrans with depression doesn't equal cis.\n\nTrans with impostor syndrome (google it) doesn't equal cis.\n\nTrans with shitty self-esteem doesn't equal cis.\n\nTrans with internalized Transphobia doesn't equal cis.\n\nRead [The Null Hypothecis](https://freethoughtblogs.com/nataliereed/2012/04/17/the-null-hypothecis/) and [That Was Dysphoria?](http://freethoughtblogs.com/zinniajones/2013/09/that-was-dysphoria-8-signs-and-symptoms-of-indirect-gender-dysphoria/) I think they'll both speak to you a lot.\n\nForget doubting whether you should transition. Doubt whether you *shouldn't* transition. What if you regret not transitioning, or not transitioning sooner? (Spoiler: that's way more likely than regretting transition.) Take every scared \"what if\" question and change \"transition\" to \"not transition\". What if, by not transitioning, you screw up the rest of your life? What if you don't transition and you're never happy later in life? If all those fears can be used against transition, they can equally be used in favor of it.\n\nDon't angst about being 100% sure. You do NOT have to be 100% sure to act on your feelings, and there's loads of non-permanent things you can do. I'm guessing that you think if you come out as Trans you have to do ALL THE TRANSITION THINGS and there is NO GOING BACK and you have to be VERY VERY 110% SURE or else BAD THINGS WILL HAPPEN and you will be MISERABLE FOREVER. None of this is true. Transition is a process, not an event. Just do whatever you need to do to feel as comfortable as possible in your own skin and in the world as you move through it. That's the entire point; the rest is noise. Transition is not a roller coaster you strap yourself onto. *You* are in charge. Try stuff out, keep what works, chuck what doesn't. That's really all there is to it. That doesn't mean you have to have surgery or live as a boy or anything else. If you want to be seen as a boy, put yourself into social situations as a boy, whether online or offline. If you want to try binding, try binding (safely!). If you want to try packing, try packing. If you want to try wearing jeans from the men's department, go get a pair of jeans. If you want this or that surgery, go for it. If you want to take T, take T. If you want to stop taking T later, stop taking it. If you want to go back *on* T later still, do that. Etc.\n\nRead *The Transgender Teen* by Stephanie Brill and Lisa Kenney and *Where's MY Book?* by Linda Gromko. It'll help you a lot.

That's not how T works. You have to go through puberty - all of it - and that takes time. Think about cis boys going through puberty. A cis boy who's been in puberty for six weeks is literally not even aware he's in puberty, because nothing he'd notice has happened. A cis boy who's been in puberty for ten months is still 12 or 13. He doesn't look or sound like an adult man and he isn't supposed to. He will in time, but he doesn't yet. A cis boy who's been in puberty for three *years* is about 15; he doesn't look or sound like a child, but he doesn't look or sound like an adult man yet either. T doesn't care how old you chronologically are; you have to go through all of puberty just like cis guys do. It sucks, but patience is a virtue. You'll get there, I promise. :)\n\nThe very best thing you can do on T is forget about it. Go about your life, stay busy, and let puberty run its course. It takes a decade, not a year.

Letting your kid be himself doesn't equal pressuring him. Pressuring him would be telling him he can't be who he is now because he's too young to understand and he should just let everything flow when he doesn't *want* to let things flow, he wants to be *himself* and be fully supported in that.\n\nKids are not too young to understand fluidity. (Being Trans isn't about sexuality. It's about gender. They're entirely separate things.) There are tons of out non-binary kids your kid's age and younger. They're fine and they're not confused. Adults are the ones who get confused, not kids.\n\nThe way you be supportive is you roll with the kid you have RIGHT NOW and don't go \"well it might change so let's just wait and see\". Choosing to not do anything or to drag your feet \"just in case\" is not \"not making a decision\". It *is* making a decision, and it sends the message to your kid that you don't trust him to know himself. That is what directly seeds doubt in kids that previously knew themselves very well and leads to an endless parade of teens and adults saying \"Maybe I'm just making all this up\" and \"I've felt this way for 15 years but maybe it's just a phase\". And it's part of what drives up our suicide and poor mental health statistics. Don't contribute to that.\n\nWhat if it *does* change later? What terrifying permanent choices do you think your kid is going to make at 10 years old?\n\nSee if there are groups for LGBTQ youth, and especially Trans and gender-questioning youth, in your area.\n\nTell your kid flat-out that it's completely fine with you that he's Trans, binary or non-binary, and that you will support him no matter what. We have to actually explicitly say the words, or the message isn't clearly received. I'll never forget the wonderful [PFLAG](http://pflag.org/) mom (join PFLAG, by the way, especially if your local chapter has a group for parents of Trans and gender-questioning kids) who talked about her gay son coming out in his early 20s; he was terrified to tell his parents, which confused and upset them because they'd very consciously never said anything about being gay not being okay. His response was \"But Mom, you never said that it *was* okay either.\"\n\nRemember, too, that you have to walk your talk when you say you'll support him no matter what. [Support for Trans youth matters.](http://www.transstudent.org/youthsupport) Support doesn't mean saying \"I support you\" and then not letting him wear the clothes he wants to an upcoming family event, or not using his name and/or pronouns, or telling him he should wait to pursue medical transition. That isn't support. If he doesn't *feel* supported, he's in the stat group of unsupported youth.\n\nThe book [*The Transgender Child*](https://www.amazon.com/Transgender-Teen-Professionals-Supporting-Non-Binary/dp/1627781749) by Stephanie Brill and Rachel Pepper is your new bible, seriously.

He grew up in New Jersey and was the first in his family to go to college, first to MIT, then Dartmouth for med school. He later obtained a PhD in neurobiology from Harvard, after which he joined the faculty at Stanford. He transitioned four years after arriving at Stanford, in 1997, and in 2008 became their Chair of Neurobiology. He was always fascinated with diseases of the brain, and focused on glial cells, which make up 90% of brain cells and whose actual purpose had always been a mystery. Ben's work completely revolutionized his field when he discovered links between certain glial cells and the development of degenerative brain diseases like Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, multiple sclerosis, ALS, and glaucoma. His discovery, and more discoveries he made after that, led to an entire new field of research within neurobiology: glial studies. As he continued his work at Stanford, he also founded a biotech company in 2011 so that all of their new discoveries could start to turn into drugs that could someday slow or even prevent the progression of neurodegenerative disorders.\n\nBen experienced significant sexism in the academic and scientific world prior to his transition, and spoke out about it for the rest of his life. At MIT, he later wrote, \u201cI was the only person in a large class of people of nearly all men to solve a hard math problem, only to be told by the professor that my boyfriend must have solved it for me.\" While earning his PhD at Harvard, he was told that he was to win a scientific competition, which was evidently between him and one man; the Dean confided to him, \u201cI have read both applications, and it\u2019s going to be you; your application is so much better.\u201d But the award was given to the man, who dropped out of science a year later. After Ben delivered his first seminar as a man, one scientist was overheard to comment, \u201cBen Barres gave a great seminar today, but then his work is much better than his sister\u2019s.\" Ben would routinely digress for a few minutes during his scientific talks to point out the differences he\u2019d personally experienced in how other scientists treated him when they perceived him as a woman versus as a man. He was a tireless and fierce advocate for women in the sciences and fought sexism throughout his career.\n\nBen passed away on December 27, 2017, after a 20-month battle with pancreatic cancer.

[Cis guys would not rather be women](https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/4hgcp8/cisgender_people_what_happens_when_you_question/). They actively *like* being guys.

Doubt whether you *shouldn't* transition. What if you regret not transitioning, or not transitioning sooner? (Spoiler: that's way more likely than regretting transition.) Take every scared \"what if\" question and change \"transition\" to \"not transition\". What if, by not transitioning, you screw up the rest of your life? What if you don't transition and you're never happy later in life? If all those fears can be used against transition, they can equally be used in favor of it.\n\nDon't angst about being 100% sure.
