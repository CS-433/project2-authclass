Number one, every Chinese Character abolishment campaign in Korea, China, and Vietnam did have arbritary roots. In Korea, Chinese Characters were heavily associated with the Japanese Empire and colonial government while Hangul was equated as a symbol of Korean culture. In the 60's Dictator Park Chung Hee unilaterally banned Hanja education despite the protests of teachers and professors in Korea. Almost, every educational institution protested this move which mainly had its roots in trying to remove Japanese language influence from Korean. Nowadays in Korea, little kids have trouble understanding basic math and science problems. Not because the math or science is actually hard but because they can't understand what the question is asking. The math teachers then recommend to the parents that their kids need to study Hanja lol. \n\n In Vietnam, the French Colonial Government tried to forbid the use of Characters as much as possible. Why? Because Vietnamese nationalists were prone to making and distributing anti-French flyers and pamphlets written in Characters. The average French soldier had no knowledge of characters making it hard for them to find and tear down such inflammatory literature from public squares etc. This coupled with the French colonial policy of enforcing alphabet education killed characters in Vietnam. Im sure you will say the French enforced the alphabet because it is more effective but theres a long history of conquerers enforcing their language and script on their subjects all across the world. Cyrillic was enforced by Russia, Arabic script by the Muslims during their war of conquest etc. \n\nIn Japan, the only reason they simplified their characters despite already having a 90% plus literacy rate was at the behest of the American Military Government who wanted their soldiers to be able to navigate Japan but found that it was too difficult for American soldiers to learn and read Kanji. The abolish Kanji campaign ultimately failed. \n\nNot one of these campaigns were backed by empirical data or evidence and were mostly a result of the 20th century chaos that resulted after 50 years of war, colonialism, and ideological shifts (like Communism) that lit East Asia on fire. \n\nPlus your final argument is basically that its hard to learn Chinese for foreigners which most Chinese will respond to with, why should their language be changed for foreigners?", "created_utc": "1659860054.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ijadxa5", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_whnfnp", "parent_id": "t1_ij8fpqb", "score": "3", "subreddit": "ChineseLanguage", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qyz1"}, {"author": "HisKoR", "body": "Execute drug dealers and the issue is solved.

Gyeong-Sang people are known for their strong pride in their dialect, many of them refuse to speak Standard Korean, and speaking dialect is a source of pride for them to separate the rest of Korean from \"them\". They are typically the loudest in the room with their heavy dialect and can be spotted a mile away in Korea or abroad at Korean vacation hotspots like Japan and SEA.

I think part of it is the overwhelmingly number of varieties of Chinese spoken in the US which means that even when growing up in a Chinese community, it doesn't guarantee that your peers will be speaking the same language at home with their Chinese parents. That severely limits the opportunities to use Chinese with friends which is important since interacting with fellow peers is a lot different than interacting with boring old parents.\n\nAnother obvious reason are Chinese Characters, its such a steep barrier to becoming literate and Chinese Americans don't have the type of organized community that SEA Chinese communities have in terms of setting up Chinese language schools etc.\n\nThe last reason is I would say theres a real lack of pride in being Chinese which results in ABC's not embracing their roots. Unlike 2nd generation Koreans or Japanese who are allowed to express a healthy amount of nationalist pride in their parent's country by waving flags at public events and pinning them to the wall in their home (esp. Koreans), it's not generally accepted to flaunt a PRC flag anywhere in Western countries (even before Xi). Maybe the Taiwanese flag is ok but they seem to be a pretty small minority in the Chinese community and would probably get some hate from the much bigger PRC community. Those that came from Hong Kong before the handover don't have any nationalistic pride since theres really nothing to be nationalistic about, they were a British colony and got handed over to the PRC who they didn't know anything about. The Hong Kong flag didn't even exist till 1997.\n\nEither way the Chinese community is incredibly diverse with a somewhat lack of shared experiences across the board in my opinion. Koreans who immigrate to the US all went through the same schooling system, all males went through army, they experienced directly or have family who lived through the Japanese occupation and the Korean War etc. Theres a lot of shared experience which makes the community quite close knit. In contrast the Chinese American community consists of Hong Kongers, Mainlanders, Taiwanese, Singapore Chinese, Malaysian Chinese, Chinese Vietnamese, Chinese Cambodians etc.\n\nThe only community I could compare the Chinese to are maybe the Russian speaking community in the US since it consists of Russians, Ukrainians, Armenians, Georgians, etc. But even they still all grew up in the Soviet Union which counts for something.", "created_utc": "1652621779.0", "edited": "False", "id": "i8p02rf", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_upzp1q", "parent_id": "t3_upzp1q", "score": "2", "subreddit": "ChineseLanguage", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qyz1"}, {"author": "HisKoR", "body": "Like how?", "created_utc": "1652613063.0", "edited": "False", "id": "i8om3dt", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_uppzjs", "parent_id": "t1_i8nwzut", "score": "9", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "HisKoR", "body": "Just another day in LA.", "created_utc": "1652606741.0", "edited": "False", "id": "i8oelj4", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_upt1o6", "parent_id": "t3_upt1o6", "score": "-3", "subreddit": "LosAngeles", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qht0"}, {"author": "HisKoR", "body": "If you're an advanced speaker, its very helpful to get your mistakes corrected but if you are beginner or intermediate it can feel defeating since technically everything you say is incorrect but you need first grasp the flow of the language and do your own sentence building.

Classical Chinese was used in Korea right up until the early 20th century for almost all official documents, literary works, and anything written by the upper class or educated. So, basically nothing of importance was really written in Hangul until the mid 20th century. Widespread usage of Classical Chinese is a lot more recent than people think, Ho Chin Minh knew how to write in Classical Chinese as well as most of the major figures in Korea, China, Vietnam, and Japan in the first half of the 20th century.\n\nAnyways, after liberation Korea was using a type of mixed script of Characters and Hangul kind of like Japanese basically right up until the 70's. However Park Chung-Hee who was a famous Korean dictator due to his human rights abuse and economic policies that many argue led to Korea's later success unilaterally banned Character education from the Korean education system despite the protests of educators all across the country ranging from grade school teachers to university professors. Later after he was assassinated, character education was reintroduced but the major damage had already been done to the character reading competency in the country. Even still, since a sizable portion of the population was still literate in Characters, Korea continued to use characters in slowly decreasing amounts up until the 90's. The 90's is when Hangulization went off since now those who were unable to receive character education in the 70's were now adults and newspapers had to take their new reader base into account. Even so, today many Koreans over 50 still are somewhat competent in reading characters but its true that most people younger than that are totally ignorant of characters besides the basic 100 characters or so. Today Koreans receive Character education in school but its basically taught like how foreign languages are taught in America and few people remember much of what they learned after high school.\n\nSo back to the point, Chinese people love to point out that Koreans can't read characters and how Koreans can't read historical documents or historical markers or signs which are still abundant in temples and historical landmarks. Even though I personally think character knowledge is needed in Korea, that is another issue.

It's just a matter of effort. Recently, thanks to the Ukraine-Russian War, theres been quite a few posts by Ukrainians who said they mostly used Russian for everyday life, academics, and work but for the past few years have simply trained themselves to only use Ukrainian and now they have no problem speaking in Ukrainian without having to fall back on Russian whereas they were totally incapable of doing so a few years ago. In fact they all said it was just a matter of making a conscious effort to use Ukrainian all the time and now it feels foreign to use Russian as their main language. Thats what effort can do. \n\n>Think about the consequences for the original commenter. Do you really expect an eighth-grade Bulgarian watching YouTube videos in English to have the perspective to think, \"Oh, right, let me seek out a Bulgarian equivalent so that I get exposure to the same vocabulary?\" Of course not. It's double work.\n\nIt's his native language, he can just look the words up or train his mind to use the appropriate Bulgarian words. It is literally minimal effort.

But theres a point when it just becomes gratuitous, if you don't know what the word is in your native language then look it up! I once had to listen to a presentation in Korean from a Korean working in Singapore who obviously probably lived there since at least high school but her Korean was still good. She didn't know any of the marketing related phrases she was using in Korean and thus half her presentation was basically just English. My director was half listening to her presentation and asked me afterwards what the presentation was about. He didn't understand anything! Surely she could have just looked up the terminology in Korean before her speech. I personally feel its quite rude to just thrust loads of English in and expect the listener to understand, it shows a lack of consideration for the audience. \n\n>Where it goes wrong (no offense) is when it starts being expressed as accusing others of \"laziness\" when they are simply dealing with a language issue that the English speaker will essentially never experience. Or at best, at the edges (I remember being excited when I finally started learning some plants and cultural practices in Spanish whose names I didn't know in English).\n\nDoesn't explain why the kids who only went to college in the states can't speak Korean without peppering it with English for everyday conversation while the guy who attended middle school to college in China uses no Chinese in his Korean. Granted, a large reason for this is the reaction from the listener, if you mix your native language with English, most listeners will just pass over what you said even if they didn't understand. If you start using Greek then the majority of listeners will stop you and ask what the hell you are saying.

Although it is thought to be drawn to resemble a dead person, it is not a proven analysis. If you look at \u5c38 in oracle bone script, it is drawn as a person's bent leg and as such it carries the meaning of corpse because this image is similar to a person's soul ascending to the sky. Also, \u5c38 can be seen as the image of a person sitting on a chair overseeing funeral rites. However in many cases, when \u5c38 is used as a radical, most of the time it has no connection to death but simply with the meaning of \"person\" or \"person sitting\". Thus when analyzing characters that contain the \u5c38 radical, there is no need to make a connection to death.\n\n[https://hanja.dict.naver.com/#/entry/ccko/69a2a93c6e45419382386afe423ef22b](https://hanja.dict.naver.com/#/entry/ccko/69a2a93c6e45419382386afe423ef22b)", "created_utc": "1647863869.0", "edited": "False", "id": "i1iqfe3", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_tiirur", "parent_id": "t3_tiirur", "score": "3", "subreddit": "linguistics", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhos"}, {"author": "HisKoR", "body": "The concept shouldn't be hard to grasp though.

Those words didn't evolve in speech first, they were created through writing. \uc720\ucca8 is a word that doesn't even exist in the Korean dictionary but appeared a few years ago in business emails. It basically means attachment as in email attachment. You would write \uc720\ucca8\ud30c\uc77c (attached file). It's not a real word per se but its pretty much instantly understandable to most people. They know \ucca8\ubd80(\u6dfb\u9644) which is the standard word for attachment and they know that \uc720(\u6709) means \"to have/\uc788\ub2e4\".

Thats only the case for foreign speakers who do not speak a language built on Chinese Characters and thus start from scratch. Korean, Chinese(obviously), Vietnamese, and Japanese native speakers already possess a high understanding of Chinese Characters due to the built in vocabulary based off of Chinese Characters in their language even if they can't read it.\n\nFor example, a Hanja exam (\ud55c\uc790\ub2a5\ub825\uc2dc\ud5d8) exists in Korea offered by various institutions. It's a type of certification that can be put on your resume or in your application to university or graduate school. Most test takers aim for at least a Level 3 (3\uae09) out of around 9 levels. A Level 1 (1\uae09) test requires you to memorize around 3000+ characters. Level 1 is around 20\\~50. Level 3 is around 1800 characters. Most test takers recommend that you give yourself around three months to prepare for the test if you want to do light studying but if you can memorize 100 characters a day then they encourage to start studying a month to 2 weeks before. (Korean high school students memorize 100 English words a day before they take their college entrance exam)\n\nNow imagine you learned Hanja since elementary school and built on that knowledge every year until the last year of high school. It'd be a piece of cake.\n\nFrankly most of the anti-Hanja people don't know how to read Hanja themselves. While all the pro-Hanja people know how to read Hanja and Hangul.
