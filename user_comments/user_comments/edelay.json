Below a link to my write up from just over a year ago.\n\nSome things I learned from doing this twice:\n\n\\- exercise, so that you can have a clear mind and have the energy to study\n\n\\- eat well and go easy on the carbs so that you don't feel sleepy\n\n\\- take breaks during the morning, lunch and afternoon to keep yourself fresh\n\n\\- have goals for each half day, day and week so that you can stay motivated. What I did was that I had a session booked with a tutor at the end of the morning and the end of the afternoon. In those sessions I had to present a summary of what I had read in the previous 2 to 3 hours in a graphic novel. This meant that there was never a moment where there wasn't a deadline that was near\n\n\\- find compelling materials to engage with. I found 5 graphic novels and read 1 each day. In fact I read more than 8 hours per day because I couldn't put them down.\n\n\\- do worst stuff when you are at the best. I would do grammar for 30 to 60 minutes in the morning because this is when I have the most motivation and I find grammar the most boring.\n\n\\- do the best stuff when you are at your worst. I had some Netflix shows ready if I just became too sleepy to read. This sleepy period can happen in the middle of the afternoon for me.\n\n\\- spend some time each day on the competences that want to improve during these 21 days. For me this was reading, writing and speaking. I was already doing enough listening so I didn't focus on that.\n\n\\- create missions or challenges each day. For example, go out into your hometown with a goal to do something in German. Go to the bakery and ask about some products and then buy them. Since you are advanced, make it a conversation about if they are any gluten free or dairy free products in the bakery. Go the government office and ask them some questions, like if they have a form to get a discount on your parent's property tax because of their age. Things like that.\n\nWhen I first did about 1.5 years ago, I was lower-mid intermediate and my tutor remarked that my speaking was more fluid. I noticed this too myself. When I did it this summer, as a higher intermediate, the effect wasn't as pronounced but I was definitely speaking and reading more fluidly.\n\nLink is below.

When you listen, you are hearing a word, figuring out what that means in your native language. This makes speaking, listening, reading and writing very slow.\n\nIMPLICIT KNOWLEDGE: Sometime in the intermediate stage the words that you are hearing and reading start to means something directly on their own without translation.

My goals in French were/are: 1) watch a French movie and have it been fun and not work (done). 2) Speak with a French native have they won't quit the conversation or switch to English (done). Your goal shouldn't be to be \"fluent\". That is not measurable. Maybe you want to pass a B1 or a B2 exam.\n\n\\- HABIT: make a habit by doing it every day the same time and in the same place. Do this if you are tired, sick or busy.  Start with something achievable like 30 minutes per day. Once that sticks, ramp it up to an hour and so on.\n\n\\- REWARD: reward yourself at the end of each session. For me, after I finished the Assimil lesson for the day, I would watch Friends in French. I couldn't understand it at all at first, but it was fun seeing if I could notice any words. And who doesn't like Friends?\n\n\\- HOBBY NOT STUDY: if you are going to succeed, this has to be fun and not work.

Something you can measure.  This will let you know if you succeeded or not. I realize this is optional, because maybe you just want to enjoy the period of time and not turn it into work. For me this was: 1) Am I  speaking more fluidly? 2) Did I study efficiently without slacking off. I tested #1 by signing up for a tutor for 30 minutes and then speaking to her without any preparation.\n\n\\- MICRO GOALS FOR DAY/WEEK: Have a goal for the end of each day and week. This will keep you motivated to keep going if your energy runs low.  My daily goal was to give a summary of a graphic novel to a tutor at the end of the morning and end of the afternoon. This kept my feet to the fire.\n\n\\- EXERCISE: this will keep your energy up and allow you to focus.\n\n\\- BREAKS: have coffee breaks and a lunch where you don't do any french. This will allow you to focus better when it isn't a break. Take the weekends and evenings off.\n\n\\- EAT WELL: eat as well as you can, and perhaps try to avoid lots of carbs, since this can give you a sleepy period in the afternoon and make it hard to study.\n\n\\- DO THE WORST WHEN YOU ARE AT YOUR BEST: study the worst or most boring stuff during the part of the day when you have the most energy and enthusiasm. For me this was reviewing a grammar point first thing in the morning.\n\n\\- SAVE THE BEST FOR WHEN YOU ARE AT YOUR WORST: save your favourite part of studying for the times when you know you are low energy or have low motivation. For me, this was doing Netflix in the afternoon if I had really low energy.\n\n\\- STOCKPILE GREAT RESOURCES: keep your motivation up by stockpiling really interesting and fun resources. For me this was having 5 or more really interesting graphic novels to read and having a Netflix series ready. During my first immersion, I actually able to do more than 8 hours of studying because I really wanted to finish the graphic novels.\n\n\\- PRACTICE THE ALL COMPETENCES INLINE WITH YOUR GOALS: for me this was to read, write, speak and listen.

This is why I failed at writing daily in the past, I just couldn\u2019t think of anything to say. What I did first for 9 months was post audio recordings on HelloTalk using the Fingtam 30 day challenges where you answer a question. I found 6 months of those and then moved on to 30 day writer prompts. For some reason it was easier for me to speak for 2 minute spontaneously than write for 5 minutes. At the 9 month mark, the breakthrough was that I realized that I could just write down what I recorded. Eventually I was expanding on that a bit.\n\nNow I look for things to record and write about each day. It maybe be a film I watched, or a fact I learned, something in the news, an interesting image I saw, or the fact that my back hurts. Today my recording and text was about Queen Elizabeth dying.

Go through the dialogues (listening and reading) until you reach a level where you can't completely understand the lesson. At that point, start doing lessons until you reach the end of the book.\n2. **INTERMEDIATE TO NATIVE:** After finishing Assimil, listen/watch to the InnerFrench podcasts and youtube channel. If you can't understand it, read along with the free Transcripts.\n3. **NATIVE MATERIALS:** Once you understand InnerFrench completely, move on to youtube videos, podcasts, articles, movies that are for native speakers that are about subjects that interest you. I love history, so I follow Nota Bene.\n\nAt this point, it is just putting in the hours to be able to listen, speak, read and write. The number of hours, depending on your current level, will be 100's or 1000's. The only shortcut is that if you were already a high intermediate and you are just reactivating it.\n\nThe above is mostly about listening:\n\n\\- to write: go to the WriteSteak forum here and write an article every day\n\n\\- to speak: hire a tutor through one of the services like Italki, or find free group sessions on Duolingo events ( [https://events.duolingo.com/explore/?language=fr](https://events.duolingo.com/explore/?language=fr) )\n\n\\- to read: this has always been a struggle for me. I get my tutor to assign articles, plus I read graphic novels in French.

I have some experience with doing a self created weeks of immersion twice and in the past and I've done in class immersions for 2 weeks. Some of my thoughts:\n\nThe 2 times that I have done 8 hours of French study per day for a week, the following were important to keep focused:\n\n\\- COMPELLING: having really compelling materials. For me this was finding French graphic novels that I just couldn't put down. In fact I would often exceed the 8 hours of reading because the comics were so great\n\n\\-GOALS:  have goals for each half day full day: keeps the attention focused\n\n\\- PRESSURE: have something that applies a bit of pressure each day. For me this was to read all day but then have to give an hour long report to my tutor at the end of the day. Fear of not having enough to say would keep me on task\n\n\\- EXERCISE: exercise each day to clear the mind and keep your focus\n\n\\- BREAKS: have coffee breaks and lunch breaks to keep up energy\n\n\\- FUEL: eat well. For me this meant less carbs and more vegetables to avoid the sleepy period after lunch\n\n\\- GAMIFY: turn it into a event or game to make if fun. My tutor even gets a kick out of these weeks of immersion that I do each summer.\n\n\\- SKILLS: one thing I like about these self-created weeks is that I do all 4 skills. Reading, writing, listening and speaking. However, I will spend a few minutes each day on a grammatical point that I am struggling with.\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/languagelearning/comments/q02q4f/i\\_studied\\_french\\_full\\_time\\_for\\_one\\_week\\_and\\_here/](https://www.reddit.com/r/languagelearning/comments/q02q4f/i_studied_french_full_time_for_one_week_and_here/)\n\nIn 2020, I did 2 weeks of French immersion online with Zoom and was generally disappointed with it. They would cover topics of grammar that I already knew. We spent a lot of time listening and not much time speaking. As well  there was way to more focus on the mechanics of French and less time on skills (reading, writing, listening and speaking). I found that the other students were as engaged in speaking French when split into small groups as I was. They were most teachers who got to attend for free, unless me who had paid $750 for the course.\n\nBack in 1993, I travelled to Guatemala and took 2 weeks of immersion in a school. We got 4 hours per day with a private teacher, then a cultural excursion in the afternoon in a mix of English and Spanish. I lived with a spanish speaking family. After 2 week, I had highly functional, present-tense spanish.

I needed to be able to greet the parents and discuss when and where to pick the kids up after. \n\nThinking back we should have done role-playing of the situations over and over, but instead we did general conversations.\n\nCovid hit and we couldn't go to Quebec for the trip so I turned the goal into getting into the intermediate level of an immersion course at university.

The first time this happened, it surprised me. We never got to the assigned article. Now this happens often. The assignment is really just there as a safety net in case the spontaneous conversation ends.\n\nThis spontaneous flow of conversation is one of my goals for French and I have achieved it.\n\nAnother nice benefit of working with a tutor, is getting to know somebody that is nice. I just love finding out what is going on in my tutor's life. She an intelligent, interesting and sweet person.\n\nWith my language partners it is the same.

I wanted more contact with the language and was speaking better.\n\nAt 1 year, I was doing 2 sessions of 60 minutes per week. I made this change because I felt I had the skills to speak for an hour and wouldn't get too tired, plus it was also cheaper per week and per hour to do 2 longer sessions.\n\nAt 2.75 years, I dropped down 1 sessions of 60 minutes per week. My long time tutor moved to a different continent and I could now only do sessions before work during the week. This is quite inconvenient for me.

Three years of 1 to 3 hours per day of practice.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>you really don't like to receive a correction in mid-conversation. does that trigger your introversion? or perhaps you just think that's not an effective approach?\n\nIf I get corrected, I start to go into my head and think too much about grammar and mistakes and I start to clam up. It is a vicious cycle. Basically I causes me to lose confidence.\n\nI have heard Stephen Krashen say that corrections don't work. They just cause students to become inhibited. This seems to be the case with me... though maybe it isn't the case with everyone.\n\n>you prefer tutors without language learning experience? is that easy to find? especially tutors who have never studied English? some teachers argue that better foreign language teachers will have some experience as foreign language learners\n\nI didn't say that. At the start, I chose tutors that spoke English well, now I would avoid tutors that have a high level of English. They might in fact speak many other languages.\n\nI don't know if you need to be multilingual to be a good language teacher. So I have no opinion on that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>.i think you are saying that you don't prefer structured lessons, although a tutoring schedule provides you with structure.  is that correct?\n\nI prefer to learn through conversations. I can learn grammar through books.\n\nYes, having tutors books at the same time each week... week after week would give me structure. This meant that on any given day I was either speaking with a tutor, preparing to speak with the tutor, or reviewing my errors from the last session. This allowed me to keep moving forward. Those habits, structure, or framework was really effective for me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>do you find self-study to be more effective than structured lessons (i.e \"teaching\", as we commonly think of it). you want a tutor, but not teaching?\n\nI used the Assimil French book to teach me  how to read, write, speak and listen in the language. It also taught me grammar and vocabulary. It was about $80 for 7 months work of lessons. This is much cheaper than using a tutor. That would have only been 4 sessions with a tutor.\n\nWith the tutor, this was the only way to practice the back and forth of a real-time conversation.\n\nIn fact I was working through the Assimil book in parallel with my tutoring sessions for my first 7 months of learning.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>how much time do you regularly put in, in total? over how long? how do you balance tutored session versus other study methods?\n\nFor the first year, I was doing about 1 hour per day of French. That has worked its way up to about 3 hours per day of French. I was able to work my way up to 3 hours because I now work from home (because of the pandemic).\n\nMy daily study routine 7 days per week is:\n\n\\- morning: post a 1 minute recording to HelloTalk\n\n\\- morning: post 1 paragraph to WriteStreak\n\n\\- morning: 30 minutes of listening to a podcast while I walk\n\n\\- noon: 60 minutes of listening to a podcast while I walk\n\n\\- evening: 30 minutes of speaking (tutor, language partner  or group session)\n\n\\- evening: 30 minutes of doing my homework to speak, watching Netflix or reading comics\n\nGosh, it shocks me to see this schedule... it makes me look like a drill sergeant. When you get into the upper intermediate levels, you need to make the language part of your life. I now watch the news most in French, watch most of my films and series in French. I read for enjoyment pretty much only in French.\n\nThat was a lot of questions.

I have an hour long conversation without any preparation (though I do prefer preparing)... but of course I am pausing to search for words and making many grammatical errors.\n\nThere are some people that think you should speak early, there are others that think you should wait until you are ready. I don't think there is any science either way that tells us what to do with speaking.  My advice is to start speaking when you feel like it or want to start getting good at it.\n\nThat pain or awkwardness that you are feeling in your conversations sessions is you taking yourself out of your comfort zone into a zone where you don't have as much competence. While that feeling can be uncomfortable and demoralizing, I think it means that learning it happening.\n\nAnother thing you can do is to join group zoom sessions. This will help you judge you competence against other students. Duolingo Events are great for that and there are free sessions every day for popular languages.\n\nIf you have interested, here are other ways to speak without a tutor.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/languagelearning/comments/v4xygv/how\\_to\\_speak\\_more\\_if\\_you\\_cant\\_afford\\_a\\_tutor\\_or/", "created_utc": "1660249310.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ijwjzs4", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_wltuna", "parent_id": "t3_wltuna", "score": "2", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "edelay", "body": "I think that my personality is quite similar to yours. I have very social with my family and close friends, but tend to become quiet or have anxiety around new people.\n\nWhen I booked my first tutor on Italki, I felt like I was going to die in the seconds before the lesson started. Of course the tutor was great and we had interesting conversations. I still check in with her every now and again.\n\nI have a few long term language learning partners that I found through Italk, back when it was easier to search for and message other students. I have been talking to 3 of them almost weekly for 2 years and the other one sporadically. I find other language learners to be friendly and curious people.  As well, I have found people that I communicate regularly with on HelloTalk but it does take more effort there since I find that HelloTalk people aren't as committed as Italki people to language learning. Maybe that is because on Italki you pay to learn.\n\nOne great way to start speaking but without the fear and commitment of a full on language partner is to join group sessions for students. You can find those on Duolingo events (the website not the app) and Meetup. This way you can join, and you don't have to speak for the first few sessions if you don't want to. If you are nervous, you can keep your camera off and just listen.\n\nAnother way to get into speaking is to hire a tutor if you have money. They are experts at making you feel comfortable and keeping the conversation going. I have worked with one French tutor for over 2.5 years... she is that good.  At this point, I just love checking in with her and finding out all of the interesting things that are going on in her life. I don't feel like I am being monitored for mistakes, I am just wanting to tell her about the trip I went on to a wine region and to ask her about that wedding she went to. The focus is on communication not on the technical details. Sure I get a list of errors sent to me after the session.\n\nWith HelloTalk, Tandem and other apps and websites, you can contact people, but the better way is to make yourself useful. Correct people (gently) and give them feedback on their posts that are in your native  language. If you do this for weeks and months, people we reach out to you and asks to have conversations.\n\nTo prepare for a language exchange session, find an article, video or podcast and read/watch it several times and make notes. You can that reference those notes when speaking to your partner. What I often do is use the homework from my tutor sessions as material for my language exchange sessions.\n\nI compiled a list of other ways to speak here:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/languagelearning/comments/v4xygv/how\\_to\\_speak\\_more\\_if\\_you\\_cant](https://www.reddit.com/r/languagelearning/comments/v4xygv/how_to_speak_more_if_you_cant)", "created_utc": "1660248388.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ijwhkpf", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_wlmli6", "parent_id": "t3_wlmli6", "score": "1", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "edelay", "body": "I tried to start journaling and it took until about the 1.5 year mark to be able to start to do it, but now I am addicted.\n\nI started off my \"journaling\" using 1 minute voice recordings. I would do the Fingtam 30 day challenges and post those to HelloTalk. People would then give me feedback on my errors on pronunciation. I have been doing that for over a year and a half now and the habit is addictive.\n\nAlmost 300 days ago, I started writing daily on on the subreddit r/WriteStreak . That has become so addictive as well since you don't want to \"break the chain\" by missing a day and having to start over.\n\nSome thoughts\n\n\\- making a journal with an incremented number attached to it, is powerful because you don't want to reset yourself to zero\n\n\\- doing public posts for me makes it more a commitment because it is more like a public promise. \n\n\\- you get feedback on what your errors are: these could be grammatical errors, pronunciation or sometimes style. Example: \"I know what you meant, but people don't say it like that... they say it like this...\"\n\nFor the first part of our learning journeys we are mostly inputting. Reading, listening etc.. but at some point if you want to speak or write, you simply have to start outputting on a regular basis. It is a skill, and you must use it to improve it. \n\nFor me, I don't like writing, so I started off making recordings and once that became a solid habit (7 or 8 months), I started writing too. Now I just love both. They are a nice part of my morning just like having a coffee.\n\nAlthough it can be ego crushing, mistakes are good. A mistake means:\n\n\\- you pushed yourself out of your comfort zone\n\n\\- you learned a lesson, something new by someone finding a mistake. It is actually a good thing.\n\nI find that people on HelloTalk and WriteSteak are really nice and also gentle with their feedback.

In a group class, I do a lot of listening and maybe just a few minutes of speaking\n- with tutoring I get to practice all 4 competencies: speaking and listening during the session but reading and writing as I do the prep and homework for the session \n- you get feedback that is tailored to your specific strong and weak points each session\n- booking tutors every week means there is an assignment that I have to do each week, which keeps moving me forward in the language. I can\u2019t slack off.\n- with tutors you can develop a friendship which for me is just another reason to keep improving. I want to communicate with them\n\nOther things you can do is find language partners which have a different dynamic than the dynamic with a tutor. With my language partners, I like to find out what is going on in their lives and what they think about world events and about different. I speak to a retired nurse, a literature student from Belgium and a Moroccan dietitian.

Others might ask what your preference is.\n\nSome advice for you:\n- talk to your teacher and ask if she can be more gentle with the corrections\n- if she doesn\u2019t change then try a few other teachers out . My long term teacher for French (over 2 years) wasn\u2019t the first teacher I found \n- for any new teacher say up front that you want corrections but they need to be gentle.

One was too nervous, another slurred her words and was hard to understand, a third would correct me even though I asked not to be corrected.\n\nThe others, I would work with again. I have found one particular French teacher that I work with weekly for about 2.5 years. If this helps, here is why I mostly work with her:\n- she respects my wish to not be corrected \n- she will adapt her style if I ask \n- if she has a grammatical explanation or something that must be corrected, she works it gently into the conversation without breaking the flow \n- she never scolds me, laughs at me or humiliates me. She creates a friendly environment where I can experiment with the language and make mistakes \n- she is always engaged in the conversation. She wants to talk about the assigned subject, and debate me on it, and give her ideas\n- is always positive and encouraging \n- always assigns articles and videos for homework\n- she is professional. There is no noise or interruptions\n- despite being professional, she is warm and friendly. It is like having a conversation with an old friend \n- she lets the conversation go on natural tangents since then I must speak spontaneously \n- she is willing to have a laugh with me, but never at me\n- is never offended if I accidentally say some rude or vulgar.

I have reached a high intermediate level.\n\nThe advice breaks down into 2 main ideas: create a habit and change the language from study to a hobby. Hear me out below:\n\nMotivation comes and goes but habits are very powerful. Create a habit.\n\n- study at the same time\n\n- study in the same spot \n\n- study every day\n\n- study even if you are tired, sick or bored. In these cases you may have to do something fun like Netflix, youtube or videos games in your target language just to get through it\n\n- start with a defined and relatively short period of time such as a hour. This means that you will have a success at the end of the hour instead of disappointment that you didn\u2019t study for 3 hours\n\n- once the one hour becomes a habit after several months you can add to it but don\u2019t burn yourself out doing too much at the start\n\n- if you decide to do more than the hour, this is just a bonus, the pressure is off, you have already had a success for the day\n\n- it is really easy to think your progress has stalled and when this happens to quit. Find a learning resource that has a schedule or progressive system built in. This way if you loose that fickle motivation, you can go back a few days or weeks and review the material and PROVE to yourself that you are progressing. I used Assimil French for this, but there is nothing magical about it. For example if you are just watching YouTube videos, I don\u2019t know how you would prove if you are progressing\n\n- have a reward at the end of each study session. For me it was watching friends after the Assimil lesson. The game was to see how many words I could recognize. It was hardly anything but I liked and knew the stories.\n\n- pursue your hobbies in the language. For me this was finding YouTube videos and podcasts about history. As well, I love graphic novels and this is a huge thing in French speaking countries. Sitting down to do your hobby is some personal time that is a joy and the time flies by but studying is a bit of a drag.

We never run out of things to say. Some comments and ideas for you.\n\n\\- ASSIGNMENTS: have your tutor assign you an article, video or podcast for the next session. You will then review that, make notes and discuss it. When I was an upper beginner, I could speak for a half hour, but after the intermediate stage, I can speak for a full hour on a topic.\n\n\\- TUTOR'S JOB: it really the responsibility of your tutor to keep the conversation going, this is what you are paying them to do.\n\n\\- MAKE NOTES DURING WEEK: In addition to the assigned homework, I always make notes on my phone about things that have happened to me during the week, series that I've watched, books that I have read, interesting news that I have heard. I then make notes on this before the session and that way I have some semi-spontaneous things to talk about during the information warm-up before my homework.  There are times when I have so much to talk about that happened during the week, that we don't get to the assigned homework. I was like you in the past when my tutor said \"What did you do this week\" my mind would go blank and I would say \"nothing\".  I've even talk about the sore back I had. For me, this is just another opportunity to learn and use new words. \n\n\\- ASK THE TUTOR WHAT'S NEW: sometimes something interesting happened in their life. Ask them about  it and ask clarifying questions. Of course respect their boundaries. My long time tutor is such a great conversationalist, she has interesting and fun little stories about things have have happened during the week.\n\n\\- LET THE CONVERSATION FLOW: Don't be afraid to let the conversation flow as it does in your native language. Ask a clarifying question and go off on a tangent if some idea interests you. This will be harder to do in the beginner levels but it is a really useful to be able to speak spontaneously\n\n\\- PRESENT A SLIDESHOW OF A TRIP: This was a really fun thing that I did when I was a beginner. I would show photos from a vacation and just try to say as much as I could about a select few photos.

I have reached a high intermediate level.\n\nMotivation comes and goes but habits are very powerful. Create a habit.\n\n- study at the same time every day\n\n- study in the same spot \n\n- study every day\n\n- study even if you are tired, sick or bored. In these cases you may have to do something fun like Netflix, youtube or videos games in your target language just to get through it\n\n- start with a defined and relatively short period of time such as a hour. This means that you will have a success at the end of the hour instead of disappointment that you didn\u2019t study for 3 hours\n\n- once the one hour becomes a habit after several months you can add it but don\u2019t burn yourself out doing too much at the start\n\n- if you decide to do more than the hour, this is just a bonus, the pressure is off, you have already had a success for the day\n\n- it is really easy to think your progress has stalled and when this happens to quit. Find a learning resource that has a schedule or progressive system built in. This way if you loose that fickle motivation, you can go back a few days or weeks and review the material and PROVE to yourself that you are progressing. I used Assimil French for this, but there is nothing magical about it. For example if you are just watching YouTube videos, I don\u2019t know how you would prove if you are progressing\n\n- have a reward at the end of each study session. For me it was watching friends after the Assimil lesson. The game was to see how many words I could recognize. It was hardly anything but I liked and knew the stories.\n\n- pursue your hobbies in the language. For me this was finding YouTube videos and podcasts about history. As well, I love graphic novels and this is a huge thing in French speaking countries. Sitting down to do your hobby is some personal time that is a joy and the time flies by but studying is a bit of a drag.

This effect can last for hours.\n\n\\- the relief is similar to exercising. It sort of resets my mind and clears my thoughts\n\nI mentioned this to be tutor a few times and started jokingly referring to our conversation sessions as therapy session and told her about the positives side effects.

It sounds like you have built a great base of knowledge. Here are some tips to speak more over the next month.\n\nTUTORS: (if you can afford it).\n\nConsider getting a paid tutor. Find one on one of the popular services and watch their introduction video. Find the friendliest one. Find one that speaks your native language so that if you get lost or stuck you can revert to your native language. Find a tutor who has lots of positive reviews. They are experts at making you feel comfortable and they know how to keep a conversation going. It took me 2 months to build up enough courage to schedule a tutor. She was great, she made me feel comfortable. I even froze up once, she immediately saw that and started asking me simple questions to get unstuck. It worked. 2.5 years later, I can have hour long conversations in French... with mistakes and searching for words but I pushed through. The tutors have seen it all. They know that starting a language is difficult. Almost all of them are language learners themselves.\n\nGROUP MEETUPS\n\n\\- duolingo classes/events [https://events.duolingo.com/](https://events.duolingo.com/)\n\n\\- meetup.com\n\n\\- in person in your city: I never did do this since I was terrified about showing up and meeting a bunch of strangers and not speaking well enough.\n\n\\- speaking to other students in a unique challenge because you have to be clear and grammatically correct when you speak. A native might be able to understand you\n\n\\- if you feel too nervous about your level, you can quietly listen with your camera off for the first few sessions. Think about ways that you would respond to what is being said. Eventually you can turn on your camera and start participating.\n\nLANGUAGE PARTNERS\n\nIf you don't have money, message other students on Italki that are active on the discussion boards. I have managed to talk with over 10 people from there. Two of them I have been speaking with weekly for 8 months now.\n\nPOST RECORDINGS FOR FEEDBACK\n\n\\- 30 day challenge from Fingtam\n\nI do the Fingtam 30 day record yourself challenge and post that to HelloTalk every morning. I'm on my 3rd month of the challenge and have noticed an improvement in my speaking. They have 4 challenges. Pink, blue, green and orange. When I finish their 4 challengers, I will search for others to do.\n\n\\- post recording on HelloTalk\n\n\\- post recording on Reddit SpeakStreak subreddits\n\nDo the 30 day record yourself challenges. You can post these on HelloTalk, Italki, here in reddit in the SpeakStreak forums and other places. I was able to find enough of these challenges to do this for over a year on HelloTalk. Here is a link to one of the challenges.

Exactly like when you were a kid learning your native language, read something aloud to yourself. I feel that this works because when I do it for 1 hour before having a conversation in French, I speak better.\n\nSHADOWING\n\nLike reading aloud, you can try shadowing. You listen some audio and repeat it has you are hearing it. I don't use this much since I find it exhausting, but there are people out there that do this.\n\nI shadow audio files. In this case it is from Assimil, but it doesn't matter the source.\n\nLISTEN AND REPEAT\n\nDo speak and repeat of sentences through Glossika or the free Speechling.

When I got to France, I thought I would try out my 9 years of French from public school. I could construct simple sentences using 19th century French but I didn't understand a word that people were saying. Belgium, the same and Switzerland too.  When I got to Morocco, it was a different story. French is the second or third language of percent of the population. They spoke it slowly and without slang. I could actually understand enough to get by. It wasn't ideal, but I could get around the country without English, do shopping, check into accommodation. \n\nSPANISH:About 2 years after the French experience, a start-up company that I was working for, stopped paying the staff. I quit. Commiserating with a friend at a pub, she asked if I would like to join her on a trip to Guatemala in a week or so. I did. The plan was to take 2 weeks of Spanish classes, then travel the region for 2 months until she had to fly back to Quebec for university.  At the school, you got 4 hours per day with a private instructor, lunch at the school and then a cultural activity in a mix of English/Spanish. At the end of the 2 weeks, a group of us were wandering about the town, getting lunch and buying things and an american student asked me how many years that I had been studying Spanish... I was shocked and said \"Years? I have been speaking for 2 weeks\".  After that my friend and I travelled around central american for a few months. Our simple Spanish became very functional. I  don't remember being using past or future tenses. We could shop, barging, go to the doctor, do banking, get accommodation and have discussions with people.    At one people I was travelling solo and staying at a hotel run my a Japanese dude that had married an El Salvadorian woman. A guest was trying to talk to her and she couldn't understand his Spanish. She asked me if I could translate. I asked the guy if he spoke English and he grudgingly nodded. For the next several minutes, I was translating between English and Spanish for them.

You can do this. One step and one day at a time.\n\nI think people underestimate structure and habits when learning a language. When I started learning French almost 3 years ago, I needed structure, I needed a method to follow. For me that was using Assimil French. Each day at exactly the same time, I would sit down and do one lesson. Generally I enjoyed it, but some days it was so hard to get through the lesson... I was tired, or sick or distracted or something. I would give myself a reward at the end of each lesson if I finished early... I would listen to Friends in French and see if I could pick out any words at all.  After several months, this 6pm french study time became and itch that I had to scratch... I just didn't feel right if I missed it.  \n\nAlmost 3 years later, French has gone from something I study and endure, to my hobby. I mostly watch news in French and consume movies and series mostly in French. I even rediscovered my hobby of comic books but now do that exclusively in French.\n\nAnother unexpected thing was that booking tutors regularly, where I was assigned an article/video to read/watch before class, that put pressure on my to continue to push forward. I'd imagine that prep and homework from Lingoda would do the same thing.\n\nIf it interests you, here is my progress at the 2 year mark.

Don\u2019t ask for location specifics etc. \n- be honest about when you are available.

Google immersion programs for English or other languages that you speak and look at their sample schedule for the week. Borrow all of the the great ideas.\n\nI've done 2 immersion programs in the past. One for 2 weeks in Spanish in Guatemala and the other in French. In both cases, they only taught use the language in the first half of the day and then we have a cultural excursion in the afternoon.  I think this is because students tend to learn better earlier in the day and perhaps less so in the afternoon. Maybe it was a case of getting the hardest things over with and then do easy and more fun things later on.\n\nLast summer, I created a week of immersion for myself using Italki tutors.  What I did was do a grammar for an hour in the morning, because I found it boring, but I would have lots of motivation and  energy. I would then move onto reading and making notes so that I could give a presentation at the end of the morning and then at the end of the afternoon to Italki tutors. This kept me motivated and on task.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/learnfrench/comments/ql5wxa/i\\_studied\\_french\\_full\\_time\\_for\\_one\\_week\\_and\\_here/\n\nSo my specific tips\n\n\\- do grammar when your friend when he is the most fresh and motivated. Most likely at the start of the day\n\n\\- mix up the activities so that nothing goes on for too long\n\n\\- do excursions and tasks with goals. Get him to buy some things at the store in Norweign. Get him to buy tickets for the viking boat exhibit. Get him to ask for how to get to city hall. Buy 2 coffees.  Get him to order lunch. Be there as a safety net so that he doesn't fail.Find those areas where they aren't used to tourists and English.\n\n\\- do things that he can't do on his own. He can read, write and listen on his own, but he can't speak on his own. So take him on a tour of a cultural site and explain things and then ask him questions.\n\n\\- give him breaks. Every 2 hours\n\n\\- if he can stay with you and your family, get him to do that instead of stay in a Hotel. He can then use Norweign in the evenings too to try to accomplish things like trying to tell your brother he want to want Eurovision on the other TV channel.", "created_utc": "1653433150.0", "edited": "1653435054.0", "id": "i9v7c2c", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_uwmkbt", "parent_id": "t3_uwmkbt", "score": "2", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "edelay", "body": "I've been using [https://www.italki.com/](https://www.italki.com/) for almost 3 years and like it.

I\u2019ll attempt to answer your questions.\n\n> Italki alternatives\n\nI think each services/app has their own benefits and downsides\n\nHelloTalk:\nI have been posting their daily for 1.5 years. I find it is good to find people that want to speak right now, only once have I been able to get someone to schedule a conversation in the future. Make it clear that you want to speak for half the time in your language then half the time in their language. If you don\u2019t do this, some people will speak only in the language they are learning. The upside is that if you have a few minutes to kill, you can quickly find someone to talk to.\n\nOne thing I find really valuable outside of conversations is that I have been posting an audio file there every day for 1.5 years. I started off with the 30 day Fingtam challenges, then just moved onto whatever topic interested me. People give me feedback on my grammar and my accent.\n\nDuolingo Classes:\n\nhttps://events.duolingo.com\n\nI don\u2019t use Duolingo but this service has a lot of free group classes via Zoom. A really diverse and friendly group of people. In this case you are apeaking to other students which is a different sort of challenge. You have to speak carefully and clearly so they can understand you. Also, you will get experience speaking to people have have accents in French\u2026 for example I speak to Japanese, Germans and Russians in French and it took a while to understand them and be understood by them. Quite a useful real world skill\n\nI have downloaded Tandem a few times but deleted very quickly. It seemed too much like a dating app. HelloTalk has that aspect too.\n\nLanguage Partners:\nI found 3 long term ones, almost 2 years, from Italki. This is really useful to talk to them.  They have different accents and manners of speaking. It has been great to get to know them well. They don\u2019t teach but you can ask them how people say certain things in the real world. They speak using slang and modern words that teachers might not want to use with their students.\n\n> conversations with non professionals\n\nWhile professionals are arguably the best way to learn a language, there are advantages to speaking with non professionals. For example:\n\n- speaking to someone who isn\u2019t patient, like in a shop: you need to enunciate well, non grammar mistakes and be brief \n\n- speaking to other students: you tune your listen skills to understand French (for example) when it isn\u2019t being spoken perfectly. Also because the other person doesn\u2019t understand perfectly, you must be clear in how you speak.\n\n- I think professionals can understand what a student meant even when you have said something incorrectly  because they have heard English speakers make a certain mistake with French\n\n- speaking to people how don\u2019t speak clearly and don\u2019t speak slowly, are common for non professionals but very valuable practice for students\n\nI hope this helped", "created_utc": "1653152678.0", "edited": "1653517050.0", "id": "i9gvxio", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_uupnf1", "parent_id": "t3_uupnf1", "score": "3", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "edelay", "body": "Bon courage et bon sant\u00e9!", "created_utc": "1653144253.0", "edited": "False", "id": "i9gdkn7", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_uunju6", "parent_id": "t3_uunju6", "score": "2", "subreddit": "WriteStreak", "subreddit_id": "t5_2dm6a0"}, {"author": "edelay", "body": "I have to say I prefer online video chat because then there is no travel time to and from in person meetings.\n\nI\u2019m a bit introverted and shy too so online is less stress for me.", "created_utc": "1653077672.0", "edited": "False", "id": "i9ddf53", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_uu27yi", "parent_id": "t3_uu27yi", "score": "4", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "edelay", "body": "Congratulations on sticking with French for 100 days.

Reading, writing, speaking and listening.  I'm a fan of French Assimil for the following reasons:\n\n\\- people have become intermediate to advanced in French and other languages by using it\n\n\\- you practice all 3 skills: reading, listening, writing and speaking\n\nI don't think it is the only method that works, but it is the method that has worked for me and others.\n\nHere is how Ian Powers learned French over a 2.5 year period part time while going to University and having a part time job.

One on one chats outside the app on a weekly basis. Tell them about yourself and why you are learning their language.

My example: I wanted to know enough French to negotiate playdates with french speaking parents. My goal has changed since then.\n\n\\- depending on your level, you may want to write the intro in Arabic and then say that to your tutor. But if you are a complete beginner and your tutor speak english, then you can do that in English.\n\nSTRUCTURE\n\n\\- tell your tutor what you want. What you want to learn, how your want to learn it and if you want them to speak in Arabic, English or a mix. Do you want lessons, or conversations. Do you want homework assigned before each lesson. My example: I only wanted conversations, no lessons, wanted homework assigned and wanted to only speak in French.\n\n\\- after you tell them what you want, be open to their ideas. Example: my long time French tutor liked to have a warm up conversation before we started to discuss my assignment. I always hated this because I am older, we have a pandemic and I really had nothing to say. After several months of that, I finally understood what she was doing. She was getting me to speak spontaneously instead of reading from my prepared notes. This really paid off. In fact now most of our conversations are spontaneous with the assignment being the safety net if I run out of things to say.\n\n\\- try out a bunch of different tutors. When you find one that matches you and your goals, it will be really nice and efficient. You don't have to have just 1 tutor, perhaps one is good with conversation, then other is good at explaining grammar. My example: I have worked with over 12 tutors and would work with all of them except 2 again BUT one has really matched by style and I mostly work with her. She is adaptable,  knowledgeable, creative, a good conversationalist, but most of all just a friendly/warm person.\n\n\\- even though I have been working with tutors from 2 to 3 times per week for over 2 years, they are expensive compared to other methods of learning. My opinion is to only use them for things that you can't do otherwise by yourself with other materials. I can learn grammar on my own, write, read and listen on my own, so I don't do these with my tutor. I can't (really) speak on my own so that is what we do in our lessons.  For me, I was learning to read, write and listen from Assimil French, but then learning to speak with my tutor.\n\nOTHER THOUGHTS\n\n\\- don't write off community tutors. By definition they likely won't have formal teaching credentials like teachers, but they can be (but not all)  knowledgeable about the language they are reaching. For me, I was only looking for conversations, so my tutor was able to tell me when I said something that was natural in French. In my case, I was lucky since she does know enough to give me detailed grammar explanations and if she doesn't know it, will look it up and send it to me after class\n\n\\- I used the Assimil French book as the structure for my French learning, but booking tutors always gave me a bit of pressure to do and complete my homework for each lesson, which was good to keep me progressing in French.\n\n\\- one unexpected side benefit is that I just like talking to my tutor. Finding out what has been happening in her life, what her thoughts are on French politics, or other current events. This deeper connection to French has pushed me to study harder so that I can express myself better and I feel that I have a better understanding of French culture not just the language\n\nI know that seems to be alot about me, but I just wanted to share my experience so that you can optimize your tutoring.\n\nEnjoy the sessions, and don't hesitate to ping me with any questions.", "created_utc": "1652205970.0", "edited": "1652275489.0", "id": "i82vwvq", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_umjszu", "parent_id": "t3_umjszu", "score": "8", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "edelay", "body": "I've made a bunch awkward mistakes in French:\n\n\\- I told my tutor she was pretty, when I meant to say \"nice\".

This is a fascinating question.\n\nIt is important to follow what motivates you and keeps you learning. If listening is one of your goals though, you will need to do more of it. See my InnerFrench recommendation below.\n\n\\> I have been studying French for one year and I'm currently around B1. I'm trying to watch movies, and listen to podcasts and news but I feel like I don't learn anything. I miss most of the words and I start to lose interest slowly in a few minutes.\n\nI totally get this. For some reason, I was able to tolerate listening to podcasts and watching videos and not completely understanding, more than I was able to tolerate reading in that same way.\n\nOne thing that could help you to listen more is to read along while you are listening to audio, as others have suggested. The Inner French podcast aimed at people who are done with beginner audio, but aren't quite ready native audio. Pretty much the level you have describe. Hugo from InnerFrench provides all of his transcripts for free.  The great thing about this is that if you find a video or podcast really interesting, you could keep repeating it until you can just listen and understand without the transcript. This is the technique that  I used, since it mimicked what Assimil French was doing and it worked for me.\n\n\\>When I read, I can read at my own pace. I can stop and focus on a word or a grammatical concept. It's a much better learning experience for me.\n\nThat is what is really great about reading, you get to control the speed and can easily stop, look things up and analyze the vocabulary and grammar. I find that with reading, I do feel that I am learning more words, since they really jump out at me. With listening, I find that I am guessing the meanings.\n\nOne of the great things about listening and watching (video) is that you don't have as much control of the speed. Sure you can play podcasts and youtube videos slower, and also skip back, but it has more of a relentless forward motion. I think this real-time aspect to listening is REALLY useful for understanding native speakers in a conversation. It forces you to try to understand and when you don't understand to guess. This is a skill in itself.\n\n\\>I believe my listening comprehension also improves indirectly this way.\n\nAll 4 competences:  reading, writing, speaking and listening are intertwined and do support each other. That said, I think French is special, because like English, it isn't very phonetic. Because of this, it is really important to hear it and then to decipher which words those could actually be.\n\nWhen I finished Assimil French and was at about your stage (B1), I chose to listen and watch more than reading. I felt like a fraud but it is what interested me more and was more inline with my goals of conversations and enjoying movies.  Luckily for me ( per u\\\\xanthic\\_strath )  I actually chose to develop the skill which (possibly) takes the most number of hours... I lucked out.\n\nOne year after reaching B1, I finally started to read more. It has really paid off. I learn a lot of new words that way.", "created_utc": "1651615766.0", "edited": "1651616193.0", "id": "i77smbv", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_uhjpd7", "parent_id": "t3_uhjpd7", "score": "6", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "edelay", "body": "I'd recommend watching the  video.", "created_utc": "1651608596.0", "edited": "False", "id": "i77becr", "is_submitter": "True", "link_id": "t3_ugu6im", "parent_id": "t1_i760ger", "score": "2", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "edelay", "body": "\u201cThe spelling of words is largely based on the pronunciation of Old French c. 1100\u20131200 AD, and has stayed more or less the same since then, despite enormous changes to the pronunciation of the language in the intervening years.\u201d\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_orthography", "created_utc": "1651518243.0", "edited": "False", "id": "i729yun", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_ugwp94", "parent_id": "t3_ugwp94", "score": "30", "subreddit": "learnfrench", "subreddit_id": "t5_2sucz"}, {"author": "edelay", "body": "It is complicated since I am Canadian. \n\nThe short answer is 2.5 years.\n\nThe long answer is 8 years as a class (like math) when I was a child in school then 2 attempts in the last 10 years that lasted 6 months.\n\nWhen I started 2.5 years ago, I was an A2, but my guess now is some sort of high intermediate.\n\nChanging French from something that I was studying to something that was my hobby, really allowed me to increase the hours with less pain.", "created_utc": "1651509060.0", "edited": "False", "id": "i71mvqf", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_ugmmpx", "parent_id": "t1_i718b76", "score": "2", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "edelay", "body": "Here is my current daily schedule with French\n\n- 1 hour listening to podcasts while walking in the morning\n- 1 hour listening to podcasts while walking at lunch\n- 1 hour studyIng: prep for conversations with my tutors or language partners, watching Netflix or reading graphic novels\n- 30 minutes speaking: tutor, language partners and group sessions\n\n\nHoly crap, i didn\u2019t realize that I was doing this much.", "created_utc": "1651502623.0", "edited": "False", "id": "i717cim", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_ugmmpx", "parent_id": "t3_ugmmpx", "score": "5", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "edelay", "body": "While it isn\u2019t efficient, that is how over 7 billion babies learned their native language\n\nEdit: really morons, you are downvoting me", "created_utc": "1651455392.0", "edited": "1651508127.0", "id": "i6z6da0", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_ugdopr", "parent_id": "t3_ugdopr", "score": "-12", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "edelay", "body": "Private teachers and tutors always have to walk the fine line of encouraging/supporting you and pushing your limits.\n\nIt is perfectly fine to tell your tutor what you want.

Was commiserating with a friend and she said, I'm leaving for Guatemala, why don't you join me? A week or so later, I was in a Spanish language school in Antigua. Had a private tutor for 4 hours per day, a cultural excursion in the afternoon and then living with a host family. I remember not studying much and getting in trouble from my tutor, but other than that it was fun to hang out with the other students. At the end of the 2nd week a few of us were hiking near a small village and we had bought some food in Spanish and had asked for directions. One of the the other students ask me how many years  I had been studying Spanish... I think I snorted in amazement. Years... I have been speaking spanish for 2 weeks. The person was amazed. I was stunned that someone thought that my Spanish was good.\n\n2 or 3 months later, after travelling around Central America, I was at a tiny hostel in El Salvador run by a Japanese guy who was married to an El Salvadorian woman. A Japanese guest was trying to speak to the El Salvadoran owner in Spanish and she didn't understand, partly because of his heavy accent, but also he low level of Spanish. The lady turned to me and asked in Spanish if I could translate. I asked the guy if he spoke English and he said yes. He explained to me what he was trying to say and I translated it into Spanish for the owner. She understood and they had a conversation with me as the translator for several minutes. I remember be so proud of how functional my Spanish was. It certainly was elementary and I only spoke in present tense, but I could translate for someone. \n\nI have been learning French for 2.5 years. It it has been tough, but I have kept at it, 1 to 3 hours per day. At the 1.5 year mark,  I got to the end of the hour with my tutor, but hadn't gotten to the assigned homework. We had just chit chatted in French for the entire 60 minutes. Sure, I was pausing to search for words and making grammatical mistakes, but I could communicate spontaneously in French for an hour.\n\nSo there we are, 2 or 3 moments when I learned that I could learn (a specific) language.

Exactly like when you were a kid learning your native language, read something aloud to yourself. I feel that this works because when I do it for 1 hour before having a conversation in French, I speak better.\n\n2) Do the 30 day record yourself challenges. You can post these on HelloTalk, Italki, here in reddit in the SpeakStreak forums and other places.  I was able to find enough of these challenges to do this for over a year on HelloTalk. Here is a link to one of the challenges.

Just over a year ago I would do this for 30 to 60 minutes before conversations with natives and I would speak better.\n\n4) Try joining a group session and then you are not put in the spot. You can quietly listen with your camera off for the first few sessions. Think about ways that you would respond to what is being said. Eventually you can turn on your camera and start participating. Here is one example of a group session for French. [https://events.duolingo.com/event/2a37c57f-88ec-49a3-9ea0-13578becc2d9](https://events.duolingo.com/event/2a37c57f-88ec-49a3-9ea0-13578becc2d9)\n\n5) Like reading aloud, you can try shadowing. You listen some audio and repeat it has you are hearing it. I don't use this since I find it exhausting, but there are people out there that do this.\n\n6) When listening to a podcast, watching a video or reading a book, have a timer to stop every x minutes and then summarize out loud in your own words what you just read.\n\n7) Considering getting a paid tutor. Find one on one of the popular services and watch their introduction video. Find the friendliest one. Find one that speaks your native language so that if you get lost or stuck you can revert to your native language. Find a tutor who has lots of positive reviews.  They are experts at making you feel comfortable and they know how to keep a conversation going. It took me 2 months to build up enough courage to schedule a tutor. She was great, she made me feel comfortable. I even froze up once, she immediately saw that and started asking me simple questions to get unstuck. It worked. 2.5 years later, I can have hour long conversations in French... with mistakes and searching for words but I pushed through. The tutors have seen it all. They know that starting a language is difficult.  Almost all of them are language learners themselves.\n\nSo you don't need other people to practice speaking with. You'll eventually get there as your confidence grows.", "created_utc": "1646000589.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hyp9h2a", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_t2pkh8", "parent_id": "t3_t2pkh8", "score": "6", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "edelay", "body": "You just reminded my of my Belgian language partner.

I read a lot when I was a kid but mostly lost the hobby and habit of reading when I was in university.\n\nReading in a language that you are learning is even harder because it requires a lot of mental effort. \n\nHere are some ideas that have worked for me to start reading in French, which is the language I am learning.\n\n- compelling material is absolutely essential. If you don\u2019t love it, you will stop reading it\n\n- whatever you love in English., your hobbies, your passions, find that in your target language. This might be cooking, craft beer, making coffee or BTS (no judgement)\n\n- for me this was reigniting my love of comics that I had as a child and teen. It turns on that in French there is a huge genre for adults. I have found graphic novels about travel, world events, rock music and history. Sometimes I have to tell myself to go to sleep because I can\u2019t put down the comic. Having pictures helps to keep my interest as I am reading and gives me more context to guess the meaning of a word\n\n- try starting with something short, like an article on a topic you love, then work up to short stories and then maybe books. At the B2 level I still find a full novel daunting.\n\n- try reading along to an audio book, this might help to keep you engaged \n\n- read for only short periods of time and then give yourself a 5 minute break or reward. This can start off with 5 minutes of reading with a 5 minute break and work up from there. I made it through some really boring university courses doing this\n\n- in the end you don\u2019t have to read. You are fully capable in English without much reading, so if you just don\u2019t need reading as part of your goals then watch videos and listen to podcasts. Reading just isn\u2019t enjoyable for everyone \n\nLet me know if you have any questions", "created_utc": "1644344290.0", "edited": "1644348782.0", "id": "hw42rfw", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_snntqc", "parent_id": "t3_snntqc", "score": "8", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "edelay", "body": "Bravo!", "created_utc": "1644259614.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hvz7g0x", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_smnraf", "parent_id": "t3_smnraf", "score": "3", "subreddit": "WriteStreak", "subreddit_id": "t5_2dm6a0"}, {"author": "edelay", "body": "It is perfectly normal to get nervous before speaking to a new tutor. It took me 2 months to work up the courage to book my first tutor. I felt like I was going to die just before the lessons started.\n\nSince this is your first time, pick the friendliest tutor you can find that also speaks English. \n\nWrite out an introduction about yourself in German and  why you are learning your language and what your goals are. The tutor will be expecting something like that. Let them know if you want conversations, grammar lessons or if you want them to assign you homework to prepare for each class.\n\nAs well pick an experienced tutor at first as they will know how to keep the conversation flowing.\n\nMy general advice below\u2026\n\nI have had more than 10 tutors on Italki and would recommend them all except 2. Of those 2 one was so nervous that she had a hard time interacting with me. The other didn't speak clearly.\n\nThe rest have been good. In fact, I have been working with 1 tutor for almost 2 years now.\n\nThe tutoring experience is really what you make of it.\n\n\\- Be clear at the  start what you want to get out of this. What your goals are.\n\n\\- Be clear at the start if you want to be interrupted with corrections or not.\n\n\\- Be clear at the start if you want them to always speak the language you are learning. Note: this will be tough at first, but will pay off later.\n\n\\- Be clear if you want to have conversations, conversations based on assignments, lessons, or whatever\n\n\\- If things just aren't working with your tutor, ask them to change, if they don't change, move on.\n\n\\-  Try a few tutors before choosing one to stick with long term.\n\n\\- Be open to their ideas. Be firm about what you want out of this, but also be open to any ideas that they have. For example, I really didn't like the chit chat my tutor would do at the start of the lessons. It was difficult for me and we have a pandemic and I am over 50, so I didn't have much to say. So I was always embarrassed. Plus it was really hard. I let it go for about 11 months, until one day we had had chat chatted for 1 hour. We had used up the entire session. I could speak spontaneously without prepared notes for an hour. There was lots of mistakes and pauses, but I was moving towards being fluent!\n\n\\- per above, if the lesson is going on a tangent and it is useful, let it go there.

People clearly learn the words that they need. These are a blend of the most words used in the language, along with the words that the person needs.\n\n\\>I personally agree with learning by category, simply because this mimicks how young children learn. A (pre-school) child learns nearly every word in the setting that it is used in, for instance cooking vocabulary is learned in a kitchen, sleeping vocabulary in a bedroom etc. When a child learns about left and right, it learns those words together as well. So no, words are not learned at random. The best way to mimick this as an adult is learning vocabulary by category.\n\n\r  \nChildren do not learn categories of words. They are exposed to a wide range of words as they experience their life. Most of their learning is the real world. It is full time immersion.

Some questions for you.\n\n\\>  especially with such a highly synthetic language. \n\nWhat is a synthetic language?\n\n\\>  This is significant because spoken Finnish and written Finnish are \\*extremely\\* different. \n\nWhen you say this do you mean they use different grammar and conjugations when they write versus when they speak or that for an English speaker the written language isn't phonetic so what you read is completely different from what it sounds like?\n\n\\> IMO, reading is the most important thing, especially with such a highly synthetic language. The more I read, the more I improved in all competence areas. I found that this was not necessarily true with listening. But reading somehow improves listening comprehension for me more than listening does.\n\nThis is interesting. I haven't noticed this myself exactly but I did notice that when I read more (versus listening) that I generally felt better at expressing myself, which was a surprize for me. Each of the 4 skills (reading, writing, listening and speaking) each support each other.\n\nWith French I have focused on listening for the first 1.5 years (I am past 2 years now) because French is spoken very quickly near Paris and I felt that my inability to understand natives was holding me back. As I have started reading more, I have realized that with reading, I might not understand a word, but get the \"gist\" of it, but with reading, I will focus on the word and look it up so that I understand it completely. So yeah, fan of reading.\n\n\\> Contrary to what I have read in the ''comprehensible input'' community, I believe it is important to practice speaking early, and I think it is worth memorizing some common sentences. \n\nSteven Krashen's comprehensible input theory doesn't say to not speak, it just says that you aren't acquiring when you do it. So probably is simply irrelvant. In fact MattvsJapan asked Krashen if early output can harm acquisition because you are hearing your mistakes, he said that he didn't know but that it probably doesn't hurt. I think people misinterpret the theories and think that staying silent is important. MattvsJapan seems to think that too unfortunately.\n\nI spoke early like you. I don't know if it was good or  bad. It was hard, and I certainly improved, but I don't know if the speaking was the cause of my improvement or because of of the other activities. \n\nEven though it may sound like I am disagreeing with you, I am actually agreeing with you.

This could be 1) Finish textbook X 2) Read a very short poem in Chinese 3) Introduce yourself to an Italki tutor in Chinese, even if you can't understand what they are saying. Things like this.\n\n\\- find a very specific goals in Chinese, instead of \"knowing/speak/being-fluent-in chinese\". For example with French, my goals are 1) speak to a French person and they won't quit or switch to english (very very close) 2) can watch a French movie without it being effort (getting close)\n\n\\- find a way to change these from a study session each day into a hobby. If this is a hobby you will look forward to it every day. I follow history podcasts in French and read French graphic novels. So enjoyable. This won't be possible at first, but you will get there.\n\n\\- be realistic and put in the hours. It takes thousand of hours for an English speaker to be functional in Chinese.

It is common for me to come out of a conversations with a feeling that I could have done better. This is even when I am enjoying the conversation in the moment. This disappointment is part of the process of learning a language. Kids don't have this as much I think. This is also the reason why experts like Krashen say that being calm, relaxed and in a good mood is really important when learning/acquiring a language.\n\nMy long term tutor is great, even though she is really professional, she is also warm. She creates a \"safe\" environment for me to make mistakes and not feel shame. She has this amusing way of nudging me to better French if I make a really weird statement \"I don't know if you meant to say X\". She never takes offense, even the time when I accidentally called her \"pretty\" instead of \"nice\". I mentioned that to here recently and we had a laugh.\n\nSorry blathering on... let me know if you have any other questions.", "created_utc": "1635372568.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hiaziok", "is_submitter": "True", "link_id": "t3_qh2lng", "parent_id": "t1_hiav6vh", "score": "3", "subreddit": "learnfrench", "subreddit_id": "t5_2sucz"}, {"author": "edelay", "body": "Thank you.
