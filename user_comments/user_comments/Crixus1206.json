It's a bit dense on the linguistic terminology but it includes text in Nasta'liq (one of the handwritten scripts for Persian) so I've found it helpful. However, Persian has a literary/formal variety (taught in this book) and a colloquial/spoken variety. For the colloquial variety I've found [Majid's Persian Learning Channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/PersianLearning) to be really helpful. He has a playlist of lessons teaching just the colloquial speech along with a bunch of other good stuff on his channel like short stories and poetry.\n\nPersonally, I've started learning Persian for its rich history and poetry so I'm focusing more on the literary form. Persian grammar so far has been fairly easy, but the vocabulary is extensive.
