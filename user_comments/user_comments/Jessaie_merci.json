Most of the words are very similar or exactly the same but with a different intonation. You can perfectly learn 30 words a day without much effort. Try to pronounce the words after you hear them.\n2. Find an audiobook that has the respective text available, or Youtube videos with subtitles, whatever you prefer. If you find a particular video or audiobook very difficult, simply search for something easier. You need to understand the text you're reading, getting used to the spoken form will come with time.\n3. You can download a grammar book specifically aimed for European Portuguese learners (there are tons of them and you can find them for free on the internet). Since Spanish and Portuguese grammar are again very similar, I'd mostly focus on reading, but knowing about the verb conjugations and whatnot can be quite useful. There are also grammar exercises for free on the internet. Search for the specific conjugation that's giving you problems and practice it.\n4.
