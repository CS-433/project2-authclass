Also, it makes it seem like soyeon is singing the entire song and overshadowing everyone, when generally all the members are very visible and stand out in all of their mvs and songs since they all get important parts that suit their voices (with the exception of shuhua in some of their past songs). It just evens it out a little bit when you take into account that some of soyeons parts are just talk-singing\n\nEither way though, I think it makes sense for soyeon to have the amount of lines she does in title tracks. There are plenty of side tracks where she doesn't sing much, and sometimes even gets the least lines (or close to it). But for title tracks she tends to have the most part and it's pretty obvious why.\n\nMiyeon and Soyeon are the two most stable live singers in gidle. However, miyeons weakness is that her stage presence and dancing are still weaker than the other members in the group. She is by no means bad at dancing or performing, don't get me wrong, but anyone can see that soyeon is on another level. As a result, miyeon gets the vocally difficult parts with minimal choreo, and doesn't get much other parts aside from that. And then, since soyeon has the strongest stage presence in the group, and is a main/lead dancer, rapper, and subvocalist, she gets center parts in the choreo, rap sections, and one or two lines of singing. I think based on the members' skillsets, it just makes sense for the line distribution to be the way it is.

Perhaps the reason why Soyeon's English rapping especially bothers some people is because she's already nasally in Korean since that's her style, so then the added nasality in a foreign language becomes increasingly unpleasant to some.\n\nI personally don't mind it. Her pronunciation not being the best can rub me the wrong way sometimes but after getting past the initial negative impression, since I know what to expect on future listens, it doesn't bother me anymore.

But soyeon has been experimenting with English lyrics in more songs than just Tomboy, including b-sides. In her solo album, Is This Bad B**** Number? had full English singing verses that repeated throughout the song. Also, in their I Never Die album, the side tracks Villain Dies and My Bag were also filled with English lyrics. Personally, I actually love Soyeons English rap in Villain Dies. It took a minute for it to click for me, since her accent is still very evident, but her flow is pretty great\n\nI do think the Tomboy rap was likely to be catering to the public though. Making it sound basic and simple makes it more memorable in a way. But i dont think choosing to make it in English followed that same logic. I think Soyeon wanted to branch out and try something risky and out of her comfort zone, in order to take everyone by surprise. Their whole rebranding thing was probably the motivator for her to start trying English lyrics more, but I doubt she would've gone down a route like that unless she was actually interested in it. She had written English lyrics before, it was just her first time writing a fully English rap. The rap in Tomboy is honestly my least favorite one by her, but I respect the fact that she put together a rap in a language that she's not fluent in\n\nAnd honestly speaking, the English in Nxde is not bad at all, imo (as a native speaker myself)", "created_utc": "1666066379.0", "edited": "False", "id": "isrj73k", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_y6egcn", "parent_id": "t1_isr7dwi", "score": "12", "subreddit": "unpopularkpopopinions", "subreddit_id": "t5_gsxgd"}, {"author": "bloopityloop", "body": "As a native English speaker who is in a writing heavy major and does professional editing, I don't understand why people are struggling so much with the English lyrics here.

Even when I first saw the teasers, I didn't have any issue at all with picking up the meaning of what she was singing. I think they make perfect sense tbh?? She left out some filler words which makes it sound a bit awkward, but American artists who are fluent in English also do that at times to fit syllable counts. It's really not that weird or horrendous tbh \ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude05\n\nNo hate to you btw. I'm just extremely confused why everyone is so hyperfixated on the English lyrics (which there aren't even that many of in the first place) when, imo, they aren't even that bad. I could understand the criticisms towards tomboy in this regard, bc there were more English lyrics than korean lyrics in tomboy, and soyeons rap was objectively not as good as what she's typically capable of. Her English lyrics were also quite simple and meh, and they made me cringe the first couple times I listened to them. Personally, I was still able to get past that initial cringe and enjoy the song fully, but I can get why not everyone could.\n\nBut people are saying the English is terrible in this song, and are comparing it to tomboy. It's really not bad, and there isn't even that much English to begin with. People are acting like soyeons entire rap was English again when she just had three or four English phrases and a handful of English words across both raps (and they fit in nicely)\n\nWell, then again, soyeon always gets an overwhelming amount of hate for a while anytime idle releases a comeback, so i guess it's just (unfortunately) the natural flow of things at this point. I can understand differences in opinions, but I feel like a lot of people are just hopping on the \"hating on soyeons English\" bandwagon, just for the sake of following the crowd nowadays. Most groups that release songs with strange lyrics just get memed for it and everyone finds it funny for a little bit and then they'll get over it. It doesn't become a whole issue, with constant hate being directed towards an individual over it, even if a member of the group wrote the lyrics.\n\nSorry for ranting btw, again this wasn't meant to be anything personal towards you but just my general thoughts on that specific discussion point \ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude05 I didn't want to respond to any of the other comments since I felt it would stir up an argument, but you seem very nice and reasonable in the way you phrase your opinions, so I ended up spilling all my thoughts here", "created_utc": "1666064435.0", "edited": "1666064734.0", "id": "isrfpzn", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_y663ec", "parent_id": "t1_iso9e4q", "score": "4", "subreddit": "unpopularkpopopinions", "subreddit_id": "t5_gsxgd"}, {"author": "bloopityloop", "body": ">That is, does she also slur the words, and if she does, is it done well?

I can usually pop open the lyrics to the song and follow along what she's saying very easily even if she's rapping fast. There are some other rappers who do add a stylistic accent, like rounding out their syllables (which kazuha does sometimes) or blending syllables together, but I haven't heard that kind of accent from soyeons korean raps at all (unless it's subtle enough that I can't pick up on it as a non native speaker)\n\n>Is the phrasing and wordplay still on point and clever?\n\nI haven't analyzed her recent raps this far in depth, but I do think her Nxde raps are very clever, just looking from a surface level.

But miyeon has NEVER gotten parts where her voice is overprocessed and unrecognizable, and the parts she does get are never unmemorable. She pretty much always gets parts that are significant and powerful.\n\nOn the other hand, soyeon tends to get the \"talk-singing\" and background vocal parts in songs (alongside her normal lines), which dont really show off her vocal or rap skills, but do take up a lot of seconds (like the uh oh outro). She usually gets those parts bc her charisma carries those parts really well.\n\nAlso, minnie, who usually gets a lot of seconds, usually has slower, and more enchanting parts since those suit her vocal tone more. Yuqi and miyeon on the other hand, are the members who usually get faster paced lines, bc they have the vocal flexibility, lung capacity, and pronunciation to keep up with such lines, and their vocals sound really great and impressive!

Also, if you wake up one day and you're really not in the mood for social interaction, it can be a complete pain... also, whether or not you like your coworkers can make a huge difference... I like most of the people I work with, and I get along with the majority of the full timers. However, there are a couple recent hires who I feel \ud83d\ude10 around, and it's been making me dislike the service desk lately. So yea, what I mean to say is, if you enjoy a high paced environment, you don't take annoying customers personally, and you like most of the people at the service desk, it could be a good department.. oh yea and I almost forgot since we haven't had a SDL for a little while now, but just make sure the SDL doesn't micromanage, cuz if you're stuck with an SDL that micromanages, the job feels like hell\n\nCurbside: 8/10 I don't think curbside is its own department, in our store it's just a part of the service desk. I like that when I'm on curbside, I have more flexibility to wander and do what I want, instead of being stuck at a register. I can help OFAs bring up orders for the SD if it's busy, and since curbside is usually dead, I can also wander off and hang out at different departments, and help them out with things when I don't have a curbside to pull, and I can hop onto a register at the service desk to get the line down when it's busy too... I just like doing whatever tf I want and jumping from task to task, and curbside (usually) gives me that freedom... the downside is that it can be super boring if you have a strict SDL who expects you to always be near the SD area and check for cars in the curbside spots every 5 minutes, when it's deader than a corpse from the 12th century BC.. so proceed with caution\n\nOFA: 9/10 One of my favorite departments, because there's never direct manager supervision. You're able to do things and burn through orders at your own pace, and its fine as long as you're actually getting some progress. Just like curbside, there's flexibility, and if you don't have orders that can be done, you can usually chill in the break room. But unlike curbside, there's no risk of an SDL peering over your shoulder. Sometimes the ASMs can put pressure if a bunch of orders start piling up, and I don't really like that, but as long as they're not rude about it, I can understand that the managers are just doing their managering thing so it's fine.. just as a disclaimer though, usually OFA is more stressful in larger, higher traffic stores, with more online order volume, so the experience can greatly differ between stores.\n\nCashiering: 2/10 My absolute least favorite department in the entire store. Being glued down to a register, having the exact same interaction with every single customer non stop, and going through the same motions a million times is maddening. But it is easy to learn, so you don't need to be worried about messing things up I guess... even then, the head cashier is tasked with finding the weirdest things to nitpick about, like whether you used the quantity button for quantity under 10 or whether you decided to just type in the sku for a non scannable item instead of going to the OCB to type it in there and wait for it to load and then get the exact same end result. All in all I hate it, but if u want an easy department where you can do brainless work, it works\n\nFlooring: 9/10 admittedly, I've only been flooring trained for 3 months now, and barely ever get to even work in it, but on the days I do work there, I love it. I really like the full time associate there whose hours match up with mine, so we usually work on projects together, like filling up bays, loading out new product onto the shelves, organizing stuff, putting out returns, helping out customers etc... maybe it's just the novelty of trying something new, but just the fact that they have chairs in flooring is enough to make it the best department for me. I docked a point just bc two of the full time associates don't really like each other and it makes things a bit awkward lol. It could be bc I'm so used to the fast pace of the service desk, but I feel like I'm lazing off whenever I'm in flooring, even though I'm still always doing something. Customers can have some complicated questions sometimes, but usually it's possible to work through it with them even without having a ton of knowledge, and worst case scenario I can just ask a more experienced associate for their thoughts. So if you enjoy working as a team, and need to sit down periodically, and don't mind lifting heavy things throughout the day, I think it's a nice department.

I went to watch their debut showcase stage of it, and Hui ended up catching my eye, but he was too pixellated for me to even know what he looked like.. over the course of one day they became one of my favorite groups, despite not even liking their debut song lmao (this whole scenario was extremely out of character for me btw, I genuinely think I was being pushed into stanning them by a higher force).. within a few days they rose to be my ult group\n\nthen I began obsessively watching their vlive contents, and hyojong tricked me into thinking he was hui so I began biasing \"hui\" until I realized he wasn't hui, and then I ended up double biasing the two of them cuz I felt equally committed to both already \ud83d\ude05 anyway... fast forward to a year and a half, and endless bias wreckags by ALL the members later, I ended up finally giving up on having a bias in the group on changgu's bday live before they dropped shine, when I saw yanan with that god-sent hairstyle and I realized there's no way I can have a bias in a group with so much beauty and adorableness and talent\n\nSo that's how I became an ot10 bias, with kino as my permanent bias wrecker...

All 9 are capable of writing lyrics and have done so before. \n\nAnyways what I want to say is: TALENT\n\n2) the members have incredible chemistry and balance one another outreally well. They are comfortable openly discussing their vulnerabilities when they're with each other, and on the other hand, they also know how to have a good time, and their interactions feel natural and are absolutely hilarious. They're just such a fun group to watch, and it's really easy to become attached to them because they have really sweet personalities that mesh well with each other\n\nIn summary: overall really good vibes\n\n3) High quality, diverse discography. Pentagon never shyes away from doing newer concepts that they're interested in. There is definitely a general \"feel\" to their music, but they are always looking to try out new things to see what works for them and what doesn't. Stanning them is never boring. Even though they try so many new concepts, their music quality is still always top notch. Also in general, Pentagon just releases a lot of musical content, whether that be new music or song covers. They're just so fun to follow along, and you can see how their musical interests have developed over the years, from the kind of music they put out.\n\nTldr: good music!\n\nCons:\n\n1) Unis never shut up. Don't get me wrong, I honestly think Unis are one of the most supportive fandoms out there... perhaps a little TOO supportive tho cuz u can't ask a question about Pentagon without getting an essay (and I'm guilty of this too as u can see with the article I wrote up there).. personally, I don't mind it. But I've seen some people annoyed by it. I do have to say tho, my experience being a part of uni stantwt definitely made twitter bearable. It was the only positivity in what was otherwise a hell imo\n\n2) second hand embarrassment. Stanning Pentagon can be very embarrassing sometimes, with the antics they pull.. Shinwon and Yeo One and Hongseok and Hui are usually the most embarrassing, but the other members have their moments too.. for example, that one time Kino randomly started dancing out of nowhere on stage at ISAC.. funny? Absolutely. But also embarrassing. To me, it just makes them more endearing, but I still gotta admit the cringe can be strong at times\n\n3) Missing members. These boys just can't have a comeback as a full group \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d it's always someone getting injured or getting surgery or hit by a car, but then there's also cube banishing yanan to China for months/years on end with no update, and now there's enlistment too... we've probably seen every member combination possible at this point except ot9", "created_utc": "1662670644.0", "edited": "1662671921.0", "id": "inn1k1q", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_x8m45x", "parent_id": "t3_x8m45x", "score": "4", "subreddit": "kpopthoughts", "subreddit_id": "t5_2730wn"}, {"author": "bloopityloop", "body": "School bullying is a really big deal in South Korea.

I didn't like it, I thought gorilla was meh and weird\n\nAnyways i'm not the type of person who would go out of my way to listen to albums, even of some groups I like (now I listen to albums more, but back then I would only listen to some side tracks or albums of my favorite groups, and a few random side tracks here and there that EVERYONE seemed to love)... and I most certainly wouldn't ever listen to the album of a group I had never heard of and hadn't liked the debut song of... but I just randomly decided to listen to Pentagon's entire debut mini album\n\nI didn't like any songs on the Pentagon album, except Pentagon.. and usually when that happens I just put the song on my playlist and forget abt it until it comes up on my playlist... but instead I went and listened to it again and again.. and then searched for the video of them performing it... and ngl the performance was zoomed out so far the members looked like little pixels as I watched with my 360p Samsung Galaxy s4 screen.. I couldn't rlly tell what was going on but I randomly got obsessed with \"the man in the center at the start of the second chorus\" and i rewatched that performance over and over and over again for the next 3 days, and at some point I switched to vlive I don't remember why, cuz I usually don't even use vlive at all\n\nBut anyways, someone responded to my comment on youtube to let me know that \"the man in the center at the start of the second chorus\" was hui, and I was like cool I wanna know more about this dude... so I went and began watching their vlive videos (which i usually never do cuz im lazy), and literally the first video I watched, the members were introducing themselves, and hyojong said \"I'm Hui, the leader of pentagon hahaha\" as a joke, but I didn't know anything about them so I didn't realize he was joking, and obviously bc the performance video was zoomed out so far and super pixellated, and all the members had brown hair, I believed him, and was like oh cool so that's hui!\n\nAnyways I kept watching more of their videos and somehow couldn't stop myself and at some point that week I fell in love with them.. idk when exactly that transition happened, but they quickly rocketed to being my number 1 ult group\n\nNeedless to say, I thought hui was my bias, but then I got confused that someone else was also calling themselves hui, and eventually in the process of learning names I realized hyojong was a trickster and that he was joking and that he wasnt actually hui, but since I had thought of him as hui and my bias for a good chunk of time I ended up double biasing hui and hyojong for a little while\n\nI tend to be pretty loyal to my biases in groups, but ofc pentagon messed that up too.. since hyojong tricked me into double biasing, my bias list was already shaky from the get-go, and with a group that has jinho and hongseok and yanan and everyone else etcetc AND MOST IMPORTANTLY: MR. PROFESSIONAL BIAS WRECKER KINO.. after fighting with it for over a year, I ended up giving up on having a bias on yeo one's bday vlive, right as Shine era was around the corner. I saw yanan with that haircut and said no \ud83d\udc97 and decided to bias the entire group right then and there\n\nThis was long, but the TLDR is that me stanning Pentagon is fate, bc everything that lead to me stanning them (and ultimately ulting them) is out of character for me, or is just ridiculous", "created_utc": "1655676620.0", "edited": "False", "id": "iczr1yu", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_vfxt74", "parent_id": "t3_vfxt74", "score": "1", "subreddit": "kpopthoughts", "subreddit_id": "t5_2730wn"}, {"author": "bloopityloop", "body": "All the gp999 girlies coming back together \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "created_utc": "1655672659.0", "edited": "False", "id": "icziv44", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_vfvebm", "parent_id": "t3_vfvebm", "score": "3", "subreddit": "kpopthoughts", "subreddit_id": "t5_2730wn"}, {"author": "bloopityloop", "body": "A group of losers getting over their inferiority complex and confessing to the girl they like", "created_utc": "1655648840.0", "edited": "False", "id": "icy3ycl", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_vfpv1g", "parent_id": "t3_vfpv1g", "score": "2", "subreddit": "kpopthoughts", "subreddit_id": "t5_2730wn"}, {"author": "bloopityloop", "body": "Covid 19 social distancing propaganda\n\nOR men arguing in school about someone's pencil invading their desk space", "created_utc": "1655648355.0", "edited": "1655648608.0", "id": "icy2zhw", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_vfpv1g", "parent_id": "t3_vfpv1g", "score": "1", "subreddit": "kpopthoughts", "subreddit_id": "t5_2730wn"}, {"author": "bloopityloop", "body": "Men dancing in a school gym, telling their indecisive love interest to make a decision already", "created_utc": "1655648334.0", "edited": "False", "id": "icy2y0p", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_vfpv1g", "parent_id": "t3_vfpv1g", "score": "4", "subreddit": "kpopthoughts", "subreddit_id": "t5_2730wn"}, {"author": "bloopityloop", "body": "I agree with a lot of these answers, but I also want to add Pentagon!

I know how much I'm capable of lifting, and I don't go out of my way to lift things that are out of my comfort range, i just grab another person for help.. i know some men at my workplace who can lift way more than me, and some who can barely lift anything, i dont compare myself to anyone else.. also I only work this job 2 days a week and I practice good lifting habits.. I'm not sure why you assumed I was sacrificing my health to lift things\n\nSometimes, when I help some guy put something in their car (sometimes they're old, sometimes they have back pain, I don't judge), they don't give me a thank you, or they'll go out of their way to make it seem like my help was unnecessary, and I just find that very rude. Recently, I helped this guy throughout his whole order, I got his 13 packs of flooring for him from receiving, and then he told me that he has trouble lifting so he needs loading help, and I was like ok no problem, I can help with that, so I helped him load all of that flooring, but when there were about 3 packs left, this one guy on lot suddenly came to help, and he put like 2 packs of flooring into the car.. which is fine, I appreciated the help, but the customer literally looked away from me and directly at the guy and gave him a sincere thank you, and then completely ignored me, as if I hadn't done most of the work, and also spent 15 minutes working on his order prior to that\n\nOn the opposite side of the spectrum, this one time me and a guy in lot were helping this one lady load a really large grill into her car and it wasn't fitting, so I figured out how to make it fit, and we loaded it into the car together (at some point some other lot guys came to see if we needed help but it didnt end up being necessary), and the lady made some comment about how I was better than all the men, and I found that really disrespectful and unnecessary as well.\n\nI personally don't see why loading things into people's car has to be so gendered.

Personally my young childhood was filled with pretty unchallenging stuff (mostly Winnie the Pooh ahahah), and in middle school was when I discovered anime and manga and got introduced to all sorts of new concepts as a result. I was (and still am) pretty indiscriminate when it comes to the things I watch (although I have developed a few boundaries now that I didn't have back then). I'm the type that tends to just watch any random trash i come across when i get bored. When I was younger I would take everything at face value and just go with the flow of the story, and wouldn't even notice that there was a problem with something unless it was made clear by the author in some way. I wasnt a very critical thinker, because I didnt have enough knowledge of the topics to form my own opinions. I think if I had stuck to just the shoujo and shounen genre, or if my friend groups were different, I might have grown up with some very serious misconceptions about the world, because I do remember a few years in my life where I had some beliefs and some things normalized in my head that sorta horrify me to think about now.\n\nSo I guess in my opinion, having enough maturity and knowledge about a topic really influences the way you internalize what you see. And on top of that, your own external environment and the types of people you're surrounded with is another big thing, it seems like. \n\nHonestly it's really interesting, but also pretty unsettling, to think of the kind of person I could've turned into, if things were different.

Gray areas should never be fully avoided in literature, but presenting gray areas as if they're completely black or completely white, and glossing over them, does not offer much room for growth for the audience.\n\nPersonally I also really enjoyed reading about heavy topics throughout my middle school years, and still do even now. And I do agree that reading about complex themes is a good way for a person's views to be challenged, and to strengthen your moral standing.

The fact that she eventually forgave him and he changed because of her is nice and all in the context of the story, but its still not rlly something I would want a young girl who is still trying to figure out what a healthy relationship looks like, to be influenced by, even though that's exactly the demographic that shoujo works target. \n\nHana Yori Dango still manages to work, but only really because of the characters being the way they are. It's able to stay in that gray area where it's controversial, but still has plenty of redeeming qualities that make it easy to accept Tsukasa and Tsukushi getting together. Tsukasa is an idiotic brat who has anger issues, but his anger is greatly influenced by his sense of loneliness, which is a decent explanation for him \"changing\" because of Tsukushi. He was always a decent guy at heart, but he feels alone in the world, and he's been made to feel like only a select few people are worthy of interacting with him, which makes him push most people away as well. Tsukushi, on the other hand, is a very strong person, with a strong sense of justice, and she doesn't bend or collapse, no matter what the kids at school do to her, and it is precisely this aspect of her personality that makes me willing to accept them getting together in the end, since I know that there isn't a sense of imbalance in power between them. Tsukushi isn't intimidated by Tsukasa's financial power, or the fact that he's a physically stronger man, and sets Tsukasa straight if/when he does anything that she finds unacceptable.\n\nThere are some things in the manga that still greatly concern me (the rape attempt, and the kids dragging Tsukushi on the back of a truck after she got framed for \"cheating\" even tho she wasn't even dating Tsukasa at the time are the top 2 most disturbing things to me) but I sort of just have to chalk those up as an attempt at creating \"shock value\" by the author, and pretend they never happened, and the story still works.\n\nUnfortunately, most shoujo mangas that came after Hana Yori Dango that tried to have a similar premise tend to be completely toxic and simply don't work. And then you end up having a whole wave of shoujo mangas where sexual assault is normalized/glorified, or the main characters are simply so incompatible that watching them get together is genuinely irritating\n\nSo I'm honestly grateful that mangas are moving away from it. The whole enemies to lover trope in shoujo manga was being overly used, usually as a way to pass off SA as a normal thing that can be forgiven, and I honestly remember being a young teenager and believing that that kind of behavior was normal and acceptable for men. I don't want people to grow up with a warped idea of what a relationship would look like, so I'm happy about the change. That being said, since the trends are moving away from the enemies-to-lovers trope, the ones that we do get will probably be of higher quality, since the authors will have to figure out a way to walk that fine line between a horribly toxic relationship, and one that won't leave a bad taste in the audience's mouths.\n\nMost of what I said is exclusive to shoujo mangas and general media targeted at young girls though. Josei manga, and other media meant for an older audience is whatever to me. The content can be as toxic as the author wants it to be, and I won't really care, since it's not meant for a young, and easily influenced audience", "created_utc": "1649342303.0", "edited": "False", "id": "i3rncba", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_ty2ah0", "parent_id": "t1_i3q22vq", "score": "8", "subreddit": "shoujo", "subreddit_id": "t5_2ur20"}, {"author": "bloopityloop", "body": "Usually \"excuse me\" works as a good conversation starter and a way of getting my attention tbh but most people don't seem to have basic manners", "created_utc": "1649338589.0", "edited": "False", "id": "i3rewc8", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_txz9a3", "parent_id": "t1_i3r65ol", "score": "5", "subreddit": "HomeDepot", "subreddit_id": "t5_2tjjm"}, {"author": "bloopityloop", "body": "1.

Knowing how serious and hardworking Soyeon is, and her perfectionism, I genuinely doubt that this was intentional though. Everything ive seen of her leads me to believe she has great work morals and wouldn't have to stoop to plagiarism to make an amazing song. Based on her statement, I'm of the belief that she was probably familiar with Wave, but after not hearing it for long enough, when the ohoh ohhh part got stuck in her head again, she mistook it as an original idea/inspiration and put it in the song, not realizing that she was using someone else's work.\n\nOf course, even if it's unintentional, this still falls into plagiarism and is a pretty big deal. Stuff like this happens with college papers sometimes, and usually causes a really big issue. It's really important to be thorough and make sure your work is truly your own, and give credit when using someone else's work. I'm glad Soyeon apologized to the creator of Wave and is giving him credit now, but I definitely hope she's a lot more careful in the future. It seems like she didn't get enough outside opinions on the song before releasing it, given how the similarity is pretty obvious, and not just a small piece of the song.\n\nDouble checking plagiarism in music is probably much more difficult than just plugging a paper into a plagiarism checker, but something this obvious going by unnoticed makes me pretty concerned. I do believe in Soyeon's work ethic (it is one of the main reasons I ult her) and I do believe she will learn from this incident and be more careful in the future.

Losing trust is a natural result when you have been hurt, especially if it has happened multiple times in the past. You might know in your head that there are good women and bad women out there, but you don't want to risk a woman you meet turning out to be a bad woman again, since you've only met bad people until now, and have gone through too much already. So you distance yourself from women entirely, and assume that everyone you meet has the capability to hurt you.\n\nThere is nothing wrong with this, btw. It's a common response to such situations. \n\nMisogyny, on the other hand, would be if you believe that there is something intrinsically wrong with women as a whole, and that all women are just naturally liars, cheaters, backstabbers etc... this belief might even extend to your daughter\n\nI'm not sure where you stand exactly, but just from what you explained to me, it seems like you have very strong trust issues, but you don't seem misogynistic to me.\n\nIf we were to flip the perspective, there are also plenty of women out there who distance themselves from men entirely, after going through horrible things at the hands of men.
