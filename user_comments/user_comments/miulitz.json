Some basic infrastructure but nothing that's going to allow people to live out in the middle of nowhere, with no resources (possible magic aside, of course).\n\nYour first cities are going to pop up around a couple of places first: primarily, places of agriculture (generally flatlands next to rivers, seeing as these are historically fertile areas on Earth) and also other places with a sustainable food source (a forest rich in game, an ocean full of fish, ). \n\nOther early cities will pop up around places of religious importance (There's an old shrine in the forest that people make pilgrimages to? People will eventually start living around there to capitalize on the visitors) and places rich in resources needed for expansion (forests for lumber, quarries for stone, and later on, mines with valuable minerals or areas that can grow a popular spice).\n\nOnce you've placed a couple major cities roughly in line with the above (these aren't hard rules), you can draw lines between cities to represent routes of trade that will pop up between them (the city with lumber will likely be trading with the city with fish; the city next to the pilgrimage site will probably need goods from the city that raises crops and animals). If it takes two days to travel from City A to City B, a town will probably be founded at the place where travelers often finish their first day of travel. Same thing applies for routes of pilgrimages or other important journeys that people will be undertaking regularly.\n\nReally the two biggest things to consider are do they have access to water (from rivers, wells, etc.) and food (assuming the inhabitants require food and water, of course). As long as those basics are covered, you can have fun with the rest.\n\nHope this helped!
