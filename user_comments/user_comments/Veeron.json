I just though, reading a Japanese text requires looking at Japanese words, so *why am I training myself by looking at English words?* Reading and recall are two different skills, and the overlap is surprisingly low.\n\nSo yeah, I'm not a fan of production cards. They have a very valid niche, though. If you find a word you think you'll need to produce in the near future, by all means make a production card out of it. Just be picky, production-cards are high-effort cards, and should therefore be reserved for high-value words.\n\nI think the best production cards are those without any NL-text, just one image on the front.

If I want a word to be active, it's always been more effective to me to just speak it out loud (whether in conversation or by myself) until I get used to it.\n\nAlso, the reverse *is* true. Passive knowledge will become active knowledge, it just takes time and exposure and is only reliable for the most common stuff, which is fine by me. I don't care if there's a big gap between my active and passive vocabulary, that's not something that can be reasonably avoided anyways.\n\nTo be clear, there are valid reasons why one might want to mostly or entirely use production-cards, but I think blanket-recommending that to everyone is a mistake.
