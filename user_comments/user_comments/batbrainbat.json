Sex is also treated like a reward for good behaviour, or punishment, depending.\n\nBut I can't always mix sex and little space. I depends on my mood, and why I'm in little space to begin with.

Bondage is very fun, too. You could use things like ribbons to fit with the theme. Maybe a cg can say something like, \"You're being much too grabby.

Infodump it is! >:D\n\nHonestly, the hardest part is starting. And like, I don't mean that in a motivational kind of way. I mean *figuring out how you personally learn languages* is usually the thing that seems to defeat people right from the get-go. So my first bit of advice is this:\n\n*Do not let any website, Youtuber, app, or whatever, tell you that you have to learn something a specific way.* If a method doesn't work or is excruciatingly boring, *change it up!* No two people learn the same language the same way anyway!\n\nAnd that leads me to my second bit of advice:\n\nIt doesn't have to be boring. If anything, it *shouldn't* be boring! If it's boring, it won't stick as well. Do things you already enjoy, just in a new language! Or, if there's something specific about your language that you end up hyperfocusing on, great! Lean into it! Think of your language as colourful toy blocks. You can build so much more than you realize with just two or three blocks, and each time you play with them, you'll end up finding more and more blocks, to make better and cooler structures with!\n\nBesides that, your resources and methods may change wildly from language to language, depending on what resources are available, and even just because different languages feel different to play with. Go for a deep dive, find every decent grammar guide, lessons page, and dictionary you can get your hands on. Even if you end up sticking with just one resource, at least you have others for backup (or if you get bored).\n\nAfter all that, stuff gets easier. You'll find your niche, your routine, and you'll figure out what works for you. I have other general resources that aren't specific to any particular language, too. I can also share the ridiculous amount of study methods I've found for every individual, like, \"piece\" of a language. DM me if you'd like to discuss all of that, if you'd like! I just don't want to spam a bunch of links and how-to's in this one comment xD\n\nThen, as for linguistics, well, learning any language is a good way to get your foot in the door, I think. I'm definitely not an expert, but I've found that I just stumble onto concepts naturally while learning (along with some Wikipedia deep dives, hehe). In the beginning, you'll learn what parts of speech are \u2014 nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs, prepositions, etc. \u2014 and then if you look up \"\\[language\\] grammar\", you can find the big Wikipedia page on it that goes into more detail. And you can kinda just... tumble in from there, I guess. That's what I did anyway. I'm definitely not a linguistics expert, I just inhale whatever I happen to stumble upon on the topic, especially if it's related to phonetics xD\n\nI hope this helps!! > <", "created_utc": "1660325288.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ik0r9xf", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_wc1o1r", "parent_id": "t1_iie9bb5", "score": "1", "subreddit": "autism", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhs6"}, {"author": "batbrainbat", "body": "It's never too late!
