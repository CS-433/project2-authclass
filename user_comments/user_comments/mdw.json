Let me comment:\n\n> Classes feel unimportant after the early game.\n\nClasses are only starting point. With strong races/gods etc. they can be fairly unimportant, but for some not having that exact starting book or weapon or stats can make your way more difficult. The early game is the most critical part of the game and the background has great effect on that. Try playing something like DEFi to see that in effect.\n\n> There is very little to the game outside of combat\n\nThat's design philosophy. Everything is extremely streamlined and while I criticize some elements of that, NetHack is incredibly tedious with all its inventory management, identification, stashing stuff etc. For most people each NetHack run is significant time investment while DCSS games are something I am willing to start for few minutes of amusement.\n\n> Traps feel like a vestigial mechanic as well. I don't know the history here\n\nTraps were more diverse and there was special skill called Traps & Doors you could train to discover traps with higher probability. Currently the most important traps are teleportation/dispersal/shafts which are designed to spice up your game and knock you off your feet and put you into interesting situations. Nothing like getting teleported in Zot:5 I tell you.\n\n> Melee characters are boring. Melee combat in Nethack is boring as well.\n\nCompared to NetHack, melee combat is more varied. There are spells enhancing melee combat, there are gods enhancing melee combats, there are all kind of allies to help you out, the weapones themselves are more varied. NetHack has tons of weapon and armour types that are basically never used. No one ever uses crystal plate, no one ever uses chain mail... the only two worthwile armours are GDSM and SDSM. Shields just add AC in NetHack whereas they are its own mechanic in DCSS. Weapons are far more limited and again there is galore of weapons (and skills for them) no one ever uses (bazillions of unremarkable polearms, tridents (their own skill), javelins (their own skill too) and so on). Weapons in DCSS can have interesting brands and of course there are randarts to make it even better. Even the fixedarts are far more interesting than what NH has.\n\n> I have seen that there is a recent suggestion to remove ammo as well, I think this is a bad idea as well.\n\nDo you really think that picking up arrows and bolts is interesting mechanic? Or having to branch early into a melee weapon because your ammo is not plentiful enough to sustain you (which it isn't contrary to what you write)?", "created_utc": "1646471608.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hzfmbkv", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_t72su5", "parent_id": "t3_t72su5", "score": "11", "subreddit": "dcss", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s7d8"}, {"author": "mdw", "body": "As usual, good features are mixed with atrocious ones.

They ran into a killer in the middle of the jungle, in an area specifically avoided around that time of year, after also just happening to be lost. We have pictures of them past the Mirador not looking too worried and going in the direction of a much more confusing area and then dialing the Dutch emergency number shortly afterwards. To me, this means them becoming** lost at** least is the most likely.\n\nI see one issue with the whole getting lost thing. The mesoamerican jungle is not your tame temperate forest at home where you can walk with ease in any direction. From what I've read, the jungle is basically impassable for the unprepared -- essentially a wall of vegetation -- and it's physically impossible to stray from the trail. And even when you have proper clothing, footwear, machete and know what you're doing, it's quite an effort. It's not a leisurely walk, it's work. That the girls were totally unprepared for such a thing is pretty clear: in shorts and tanktops they'd be shredded by the plants and eaten by the insects . So that leads us to the conclusion, that they would have to get lost on some of the trails in the area. How would they not be found on those trails, eventually?\n\nAlso, we know very little as not much was revealed by the investigation. Imagine, that they actually turned around at that creek and actually returned back to Boquete. Somewhere near the town they encountered a guy(s) and took a photo of them. They were enticed to go with them, maybe to visit the Caldera hot springs. After all, a blurry photo has surfaced where two girls, one of them redhead are in the water with few guys. Girls refused advances from the guys, situation escalated and they ended dead. And since that moment everything is a coverup. Occasional calls to emergency numbers, nighttime photos at unknown location with hair photo of already dead Kris in the middle, pictures' metadata manipulated to fit the timeline, critical photo 509 showing the guy(s) securely deleted, dismembering the bodies, botched attempt to dissolve them in lime, eventually placing some bones and the backpack in considerable distance from Mirador to mislead the search.", "created_utc": "1622381895.0", "edited": "1622384929.0", "id": "gzz2b2p", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_nig1mt", "parent_id": "t1_gz1tz0z", "score": "1", "subreddit": "KremersFroon", "subreddit_id": "t5_26a5my"}, {"author": "mdw", "body": "> If it was a lost scenario and their bodies were in the river for so long, why the animals were not interested on it?\n\nIt's simple, the conclusion of the investigation is contradicted by its own findings.

The `-pix_fmt` argument is important if you encode from DNxHR source, otherwise you'll end up with something like 4:4:4 video which not many players support (and which is too big anyway).\n\nIf you want H.264, replace libx265 with libx264.
