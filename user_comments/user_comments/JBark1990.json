I can\u2019t cut and paste (I\u2019m on my phone) to be sure but the length seems above the 275~300. Disregard if I\u2019m wrong there.\n\nWhat I\u2019m seeing is an introduction of two main characters. The reason I\u2019m not sure this is what you\u2019re after is because, as written, the majority of the query is spread between the two. This would make more sense, I think, if this was a multi-POV book. Is it?\n\nI\u2019m thinking through what a query should have and getting these answers.\n\n1. Who\u2019s the MC? Wren AND Chiama (?)\n\n2. What does the MC want?\nWren; wants out of her contract\nChiama; to not lose her scholarship\u2026? If that\u2019s right, it\u2019s a little soft in terms of stakes. I\u2019m with Wren. I like her story. Chiama seems like a tool for Wren but she also gets her own paragraph in the query so I don\u2019t really know (reference number 1).\n\n3. What\u2019s stopping the MC? I don\u2019t know. I know Wren is trying to figure out how to use Chiama but I don\u2019t know what\u2019s stopping Wren from doing that. And Chiama, well\u2026nothing seems to be stopping her as far as I can tell.\n\n4. What happens if they fail? Wren has to keep doing the job she doesn\u2019t like and continue paying her brother\u2019s medical bills and Chiama\u2026Again, I don\u2019t know.\n\nSo, yeah. Overall, I recommend focusing entirely on Wren since her story sounds infinitely more interesting (to me) and using that cut word space to mention Chiama and her purpose without her background and personality. Use those words to answer those four questions I posed in as clear a way as possible and I think you\u2019ll have something!\n\nAll that said, this is my opinion and I\u2019m no expert\u2014just read a ton of these and went through this myself (in five very painful attempts).

The stakes aren\u2019t super clear to me. If the worst of things is that she just stays with Momma in the same situation, then it doesn\u2019t sound like much is at risk. Losing an inheritance sucks but I just don\u2019t get the impression the protagonist has much to lose.\n\n2. I don\u2019t know that I understand the present the protagonist feels after she abandons her mother. I kinda got some supernatural vibes but I\u2019m pretty sure that\u2019s not right because that\u2019s not what this novel seems to be about.\n\n3. I was a little confused when Vy gets read the will then runs off to college. Is she preparing while waiting for a specific date? Why doesn\u2019t she run straight to the Tennessee cottage? Some clarification there would be awesome.\n\nSo, yeah. Seems interesting enough. The gist I get is that Vy gets the potentially best news of her life and abandons her abusive mom to solve puzzles with the hopes of an unknown inheritance.\n\nI had to read twice before I understood the lawyer\u2019s son so you may consider addressing when he shows up and why\u2014or cutting him entirely. I don\u2019t get the impression he\u2019s super important to the overall story from just the query alone.\n\nIn summary, I think I understand who your character is. I understand her goals (to get the money and go to college with her friend. I don\u2019t fully understand what\u2019s stopping her (the puzzles? Guilt about abandoning her abusive mother?) and I\u2019m not entirely sure of the stakes.

It feels way more real that way.\n\nOn a semi-related note, I got back from Dublin yesterday and I gotta say that I absolutely fell in love with the city\u2019s history. If there\u2019s some traditional Irish folklore sprinkled over this, I wanna read the hell out of it. Not sure if anyone else is doing this right now so I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if you get bites immediately, as-is, without changing anything.\n\nAll that aside, I agree with the summaries of Import_Tax and kuesgi.

I find myself asks why the empire would kill him. Obviously, they don\u2019t want a monster\u2014especially a *native* one running loose\u2014but I don\u2019t really get the stakes there. If the last sentence of the first paragraph (after the housekeeping) and the first sentence of the next aren\u2019t connected, disregard my question. The bit about the empire makes it feel like it\u2019s trying to add tension but it also feels like a line jammed in there to try and force there to be stakes where there may not be. Hope that all makes sense.\n\nAs I continue, I find myself wondering what happens to the person who gives Gazzer the document that leads him to Layla. This makes me think a third party knows what\u2019s happening. So, is that document unrelated and by Gazzer delivering it, the two meet by chance? Does that question/my confusion make sense?\n\nLike, if that document was a routine one and Gazzer happened to notice she had bruises, too, and that\u2019s what led them on this journey together, is totally get that\u2014but it doesn\u2019t read that way. If HER job\u2014the one where Gazzer was almost murdered\u2014is how Gazzer meets Layla, I didn\u2019t see that connective tissue either. I hope they\u2019re connected because now I\u2019m thinking Gazzer and Layla both almost die and save one another and THAT\u2019S what gets them going.\n\nI\u2019ll stop rambling.

I'm looking for a critique partner for my manuscript! It's 83,400 words and is an adult fantasy/adventure.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI didn't expect to find someone not already taken so I didn't prepare a blurb. Sooooo, here's my query! :-) Happy to do a swap if you're interested! Note: I took out the intro and my bio and left just the \"meat\".\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAfter being made a scapegoat for a failed raid, Captain Reynor faces the noose. When a syndicate of bankers and fellow pirates gives him one season to cover their losses, he looks for a solution\u2014and a pub where he can start a tab.\r  \n\r  \nWhen the Crown offers a fortune to anyone able to discover what happened to its treasure colony, Reynor charms a group of outcasts, including a witchcraft-using surgeon and half-human carpenter, into joining his crew. Along the way, he must contend with an enemy nation\u2019s navy, but his magic-imbued, self-repairing ship SHOULD keep him afloat. To claim the reward, he\u2019ll need to use his cunning\u2014and best insults\u2014to keep himself and crew from being hanged once the ruthless Commodore Rachel Brass is involved.\r  \n\r  \nReynor is (falsely, thank you) accused of organizing the demise of the very treasure colony he seeks\u2014and it\u2019s Brass\u2019s mission to catch him. Reynor\u2019s trail of sacked ports, adrift ships, and their angry crews makes it easy for Brass to find him. As they exchange cannonade, their guns awaken vicious mermaids ready to defend their home with tooth and claw. Ultimately, it may not be Brass\u2014but what\u2019s under the waves\u2014that sinks his aspirations. And his ship.\r  \n\n\nLooking for all the things you've mentioned. The manuscript is in its 6th draft so it's very polished. I'm to the point where I've looked at it so long that I miss easy stuff.

I don\u2019t remember what percent but I don\u2019t remember Hamish becoming the captain until well into the last third or even last quarter of the book.\n\nOn that note, E, I would say the query is a little out of order because Hamish becomes captain after he finds out about Emily. I don\u2019t think an agent is gonna decide not to represent you because your query was out of order but it MIGHT get her wondering later on. Even if it doesn\u2019t, I think it gets after u/Complexer_Eggplant \u2018s point about it sounding kinda strange. Martin going from deckhand to captain by the middle of the book would be kinda weird (I think I left some comments about that in your MS about this same topic) but I know it doesn\u2019t happen until later. All said, I think incorporating some lines from your response would be appropriate\u2014mentioning that Martin doesn\u2019t just find himself captain, but rather, it\u2019s after a series of events leave him mostly as the only choice.\n\nOverall, I definitely think your query (other than the mismatch of timing between Emily and Martin becoming captain) reads very much like a synopsis with certain parts removed. Specifically, E, this query reads like it\u2019s very focused on the broad picture. I\u2019m not an agent so I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s good, bad, or in-between. What I know is that a lot of people tend to focus more on the character, their desires, and what\u2019s stopping them\u2014if I hadn\u2019t read the manuscript, I wouldn\u2019t know that Martin Hamish is the main protagonist. Maybe others in here caught that but I\u2019m not sure I would have. But maybe that doesn\u2019t matter\u2014I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m pointing it out for your consideration!\n\nI definitely think your book is somewhere between \u201caction\u201d and \u201cthriller\u201d. I think it\u2019s missing the clock that\u2019s indicative of a thriller so maybe \u201chistorical action\u201d would be closer to appropriate. Just my two cents as I\u2019m not an agent and by no means an expert in marketing!\n\nOverall, love the work you\u2019ve done on this. It\u2019s super close to the manuscript and I have no doubt your pirate story gets published before mine. Hell, I may even be able to comp your book in my query if I keep getting conflicting guidance on how to correct it lol.\n\nTake care!\n\n-J", "created_utc": "1655307875.0", "edited": "False", "id": "icgtvg2", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_vcq7m6", "parent_id": "t3_vcq7m6", "score": "1", "subreddit": "PubTips", "subreddit_id": "t5_3h5w8"}, {"author": "JBark1990", "body": "Apologies on behalf of those from my nation who think German isn\u2019t important.\n\nI\u2019m stationed in Bavaria in support of NATO and can say Germany is EXTREMELY important.

This feedback has a great mix of goods and bads so that I feel as though I'm still sort of on the right track.\n\nSome of your comments have me laughing (only so I don't cry) because I've had comments in previous version that tell me to do away with some things you've recommended I put in--answers to certain questions.\n\nIn no particular order:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI appreciate your feedback on the fantasy elements piece. I feel like with the oppressive word count limits that I've got it about as lean as possible without removing instances where I tried to add some voice. I'll spend some time thinking about how to incorporate those elements here without lengthening it and turning it into a synopsis.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe comment about the ending is an area that has me pulling out my hair--previous comments have told me I shouldn't be telling what happens. Your further breakdown of how I can make that better is among the best feedback I've gotten because it doesn't just say stuff--I feel like I can understand your perspective because of that extra information and that's infinitely more helpful than just telling me \"it feels flat\". Actually, in a previous version, I was explicitly told NOT to resolve the conflict because \"it's not a synopsis\". Here, too, your recommendation to have it resolved then see how he moves forward is a new piece of guidance so I'll take a minute to try and apply that and see where it goes!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUnderstand what you're saying about the \"why\" behind Brass chasing the MC. I DID have this before but was told I had too many proper nouns (I named another antagonist). I'll try and find a difference. If you were curious, another pirate tells the Crown the MC is to blame so that's when they send Brass to get him. I can probably summarize that in under a sentence! Thanks for pointing that out. I hope it resolves that cyclical reasoning for why people are doing what. It sounds obvious now that you've pointed it out, so thank you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou raised an important point about the MC and his ragtag crew. Yes, the crew is ragtag, but the ship isn't. The MC owns it and it has its own level of magic that adds to the fantasy piece. This further gets after that I've left out details about tee navy (which you noticed). It's a foreign nation's navy so the MC isn't fighting his own people, but I can see why it looks like he could be. Here, too, if I answer these questions, I'm gonna eat up a lot of words so I wonder if having them answered make the query better at hooking the agent. Knowing where you as a reader have questions is helpful because I can see where I'm short. I can't help but think I have to STOP trying to answer every question because of that word limit. My problem to figure out but you're helping me realize this!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy MC is specifically NOT a cold blooded guys either! I tried to show that in the query by mentioning that he was found because he DIDN'T kill everyone--that allowed Brass to follow him. That didn't come through strong enough so thanks for pointing that out, too. I'll rework that piece as well. It's important the MC isn't seen as an anti-hero. He's morally gray--don't get me wrong!--but he's definitely not out to kill people just because.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI also appreciate your thoughts on how this sounds similar to PotC. A read of the synopsis or the book itself would show that it's not the same story, but you're right--I only have the query to get after that. Proper nouns would help because I could name the world and nations involved because it is NOT on earth in the Caribbean--a deliberate choice because I wanted to avoid this comparison at all costs. So yeah, this is helpful. Maddening because no easy solution presents itself, but still helpful.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf the overall objectives of a query is to get someone's interest, would you say that the questions you had were enough of a turn-off that you'd pass on it? I know you said it sounded like a fun read (thank you!), but I'm wondering if that's enough. I want this to be great but I also can't help but think I could post this each week and get different feedback each time that contradicts what others have said (much like this time).

With those grains of salt out of the way, here are my thoughts.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe first paragraph's comp titles threw me a bit. Partially because I'm now familiar with the query formula but also because I wasn't sure at first which set of capital letters belonged to your book and which were the comp titles. I think it's a style thing to put the housekeeping up front so I can't and won't tell you it's \"wrong\". I just wasn't prepared and had to read it a couple times to \"get it\".\n\nOne point of confusion for me was why Juliette doesn't get that hero's medal. It sounds like she's a hero so I'm a little confused why the king wants to make Juliette's powers illegal. Queries suck for this reason because comments like these might make you think you have to answer all the questions but that's not necessarily what I'm getting at. Specifically, it's a question I have as I read through this query. If it's not important then I think you can disregard but I wanted to share it so you know what I thought as someone who isn't initiated to your story (like an agent).\n\nParagraph 4--counting paragraph 1 as AFTER your personalization--had me a little lost. I found myself NOT on earth and that dragons were part of this world all at once. Overall, I'm just now sure what's going on here.\n\nThe mention of cell phones threw me further. I was imagining more of a fantasy-type setting but that line made me question when this story is happening. I recognized that it's not on earth but the clash of earth and non-earth things left me a bit lost.\n\nOverall, I think we have some cool information and we're missing some other stuff we'd expect in a query. What I want to know is the following:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. Who is your main character?\n2. What does she want?\n3. What's in the way of her getting what she wants?\n4. What are the stakes she faces?\n\nI'm not sure how far into the story this query goes but I'd recommend sticking somewhere between the first third and the midpoint so we get a sense of the 4 questions above.

It sounded a bit nebulous so I apologize for not being able to be more clear.\n\nOverall, we thought Free Time was fine but not great and are hoping it\u2019s better on the kindle since it won\u2019t have movies and games. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "created_utc": "1638028295.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hma96cq", "is_submitter": "True", "link_id": "t3_r39v0u", "parent_id": "t1_hma8q1o", "score": "2", "subreddit": "kindle", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qudz"}, {"author": "JBark1990", "body": "I\u2019d say it depends on which state you\u2019re in.
