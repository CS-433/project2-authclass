We usually call those consistent solutions equilibria. I think this reflects how academic economists think about economics better than the definition that is given to you. In the end, whether your needs are unlimited or not is really inessential to this study. Indeed, in most economic models, either the demand is bounded somehow or the utilities are concave enough so that even though the demand is unbounded, after some point, having more of something doesn't really make you significantly happier so the demand becomes almost flat.\n\nAlso, satisficing is a very old idea in economic theory and many models assume preferences that are consistent with it. It basically goes something like this: First I want to have enough to eat. Once I have that, I am happy to maximize the social welfare with the rest of my resources. (Simon was probably the first to formalize this.)\n\nAlso, the \"unlimited needs, limited resources\" definition doesn't capture the interdependent and simultaneous nature of most economic problems. Economics is not just you maximizing your utility given all prices and your budget. Sellers are choosing the prices, your employer chooses your wage, government is choosing the tax rates, customs policies etc. so that even a mildly realistic model of the real economy is a super complex network with lots of connections that determine what is available to each agent and what anyone does has effects on many other parts of the economy.\n\nSo far I mostly dodged your main question but I think it is really impossible to answer. The thing is, we don't really know some parts of our preferences, until relevant options are available to us. It is different thinking about what we would do under certain circumstances vs. actually being under those circumstances; lots of social psychology/experimental economics papers show that what we think we would do from a cold state and what we actually do in the hot state are not really the same thing or even close to each other. For example, I feel like if I had a billion dollars, I wouldn't work one more day in my life. However, I will likely never have a billion dollars. So I can't really know what I would do if I had a billion dollars, with lots of opportunities to have two billions dollars.\n\nThere is also another way to think about this problem. If I had a choice between having a billion dollars vs. two billions dollars, I would choose two billions dollars. It is not that I can think of ways to spend (more than) the first billion dollars so that I want the second. Two billions simply provide more choices and flexibility; once you have it, you can always burn half of it, if that will make you happy. So in this weak sense, I would of course prefer to have more money to less, since I can always discard/donate/burn etc. if I want it. However, in this form of the problem, I don't have to work for the second billion dollars. There is simply no opportunity cost for having it. In life, it usually gets harder and harder to get more and more money. (This is why in most economic models with production, we assume that the cost function is convex so that it gets more costly to produce higher quantities.) So, again, I think whether the needs are really unlimited or not is irrelevant since the choice is never between more or less but usually we choose between more for more work vs. less for less work etc.\n\n(One final note based on the physical universe we inhabit: Everything is limited so even if the needs are unlimited, it doesn't matter, as unlimited amount of something can never be achieved.)", "created_utc": "1616489907.0", "edited": "False", "id": "grwqwoq", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_mb53eo", "parent_id": "t3_mb53eo", "score": "6", "subreddit": "AskAnthropology", "subreddit_id": "t5_2wl4u"}, {"author": "amhotw", "body": "Even if you don't return the exam, they will discuss the questions among themselves and figure out what happened?

This would work if the utility you get from money is sufficiently linear around your current wealth level. However, for most people, this is not the case. (Tons and tons of research has shown this.)

So more appropriate test is to decide whether you are okay with losing x dollars and having the good vs. keeping the money and not having the good, which is the initial problem...\n\nInstances where this kind of thinking is somewhat valid are either when you are very rich (so that your preferences are more likely to be linear in money) or the price of the good is very small relative to your wealth (so that we are in a small enough neighborhood of your current utility level and hence the effect is somewhat linear). Of course, if there are discontinuities, nothing like this would work.

Why the preferences are like that, can we measure them etc. are not really the concern here. We are just focusing on what a rational player should do under the given conditions. When you study this game as it is given, you see that according to the assumed preferences, not cooperating is a dominant strategy. So any rational person with those preferences should play the dominant strategy and not cooperate. Every time this comes up, someone new to the concept will say that \"but people value cooperation for its own sake, they should cooperate\". But then that means having different preferences. Of course there is nothing wrong with valuing cooperation; we all cooperate with some people on some issues even when it conflicts with our self-interests in some way. However, that is simply a different game. So for example you can add a certain number to their payoffs when they cooperate and depending on how much they value cooperation (how big a number you add), cooperation may become the dominant strategy. But again, that's a different game. And we have plenty of games where we study cooperation. (For example, stag hunt is a famous example commonly covered in an introductory course.)\n\nThere are several implications of this issue. For example, suppose we do experiments with students, making them play prisoners' dilemma. We are telling them that they are playing as players with preferences given in the question. However, they may add some extra value to cooperation, thinking it is not already incorporated. Nowadays pretty much all experiments are incentivized to mitigate this problem in a sense so that whatever payoff they obtain in the game is what they get paid or added to it etc. However, some people still cooperate. This is because monetary payment they receive doesn't include the payoff of cooperation. They may think \"okay, I am not going to be a uncooperative person for x dollars\" and cooperate no matter what. This still doesn't conflict rationality in anyway.\n\nEconomics students may be more selfish in these games but I mean there are obvious reasons for this. Obviously, there is self-selection. Usually most people study economics/finance at the undergraduate level not because they are curious about our decision processes etc. but to make money. So these people probably value money (on average) more than someone studying philosophy. Second, they fall into the same trap I am arguing against here. It goes like something like this. \"I am an economist, I know what to do, I must act rationally. But that means being selfish so I will play selfishly.\" I have seen a lot of undergraduate students who were confused along these lines. This may be what you are referring to in your last paragraph when you say teachings but if someone comes out of economics education with this idea of economist --> rational --> selfish, they misunderstood what we were doing. We can find more reasons easily but I think these explain most of the differences.\n\nI think your second point is not too far away from what I have been writing above. (I should note that I am a theoretical economist, I am not interested in measurements, estimations etc. What people do with data is really not my concern so I won't go too much into that.) I am considering a game a looking at its equilibria. If there are two people who can either go to see a movie on their own or do other stuff etc. this sounds very much like a battle of sexes (or stag hunt, which I mentioned in the context of cooperation above). Obviously, there are hundreds of things that factor into our decisions everyday so if you want to estimate something that involves many people from actual data and not from a theoretical point of view, it is a difficult problem. But we have ways of dealing with it. For example Ken Judd uses supercomputers to model the carbon emission, possible effects of a certain tax on carbon emission in the long run etc.\n\nWhen we have several people making choices, this is the \"several interdependent simultaneous optimization problems under constraints\" part of the definition I gave at the beginning. There is not always a unique solution and when there is, it is not always easy to find it but this is not a problem specifically about economics. Physicists follow several objects moving around, hitting each other and other objects and keep moving on. (We actually share some tools with them; control theory, ergodic theory etc.)\n\nIn terms of the epistemics of the problems that concern several players/agents, we have a whole area called epistemic game theory. In fact, very closely related area of epistemic and deontic logic is one of the common grounds where both philosophers and economists (as well as some computer scientists)  work together to find solutions to problems of knowledge and beliefs.\n\nI should get back to work but I want to add that if an economist is using rationality as a reason for being selfish, economics is not to be blamed here.

Fair division and bankruptcy problems, and cooperative bargaining problems all focus on somewhat normative questions such as how to share a surplus we jointly created. However, the distinction from the 19th century approach is that these studies are very explicit about what they are doing and what they do is not to give answers like \"surplus should be shared in this manner because this is what I consider fair\" but rather say \"if you want a division that has these properties, then you should share the surplus according to this rule\". So it has some normative flavors but what they do is to consider some sets of axioms that people may associate with some notion of fairness and follow them to their logical/mathematical conclusions. Many Nobel laureates had some works of this form so these were not really some heterodox dudes. (Nash, Aumann, Shapley and probably more.) \n\nAnother field that is not too far away from these kinds of questions is social choice theory (and some mechanism design). Here the issues are finding a function that represents diverse preferences of a population or given a notion of social welfare (as a function of people's preferences), finding the outcomes that can be implemented. For example, Arrow's theorem, Gibbard-Satterthwaite theorem etc. These results are basically telling us that if we want to govern a group of people according to some rules and we want these to satisfy certain restrictions, we can't have all the good things. (Again, they list some axioms on social choice functions/correspondences and follow their conclusions.) Many Nobel laureates again, Arrow, Hurwicz, Maskin, Myerson, Sen... Also, we still have a very active political economy field, much more so than the axiomatic approaches I mentioned before. Probably the most famous result from there is the median voter theorem.\n\nSo I would say what we are doing is to finding the implications of certain normative positions and providing the limits of what can be done from each point of view. We let the choice of the axioms to philosophers. (I mean obviously we all have our own views but that's not what we discuss in our academic work.)\n\nHomo economicus criticisms are of course very old but so are the fields of behavioral/experimental/neuro economics and to some extent decision theory. Before going into these, I want to say that many of the criticisms equate rationality with \"antisocial\"/\"selfish\" etc. behavior and then focus on these instead of what we really mean by rationality. But the assumption of rationality in economics doesn't say anything about the preferences. If someone is completely altruistic, what rationality requires him to do is to act like an altruist. Rationality is about consistency of the behavior and preference, it is not a particular type of preference. [We sometimes call preferences rational when they are \"internally consistent\" in a sense (if you strictly prefer apples to bananas, you don't strictly prefer bananas to apples) but that's a different/neutral use of the word.]\n\nEach of these fields focus on developing new theories that weakens our assumptions of rationality, understanding implications of weaker notions of rationality. For example, Herbert Simon discusses satisficing decision criteria in 1940s. Since then, many forms of bounded rationality, rational inattention etc. have been extensively studied.\n\nIn general, what we are doing is not to say that \"(i) people are rational and (ii) a model tells us rational people do x, hence we expect people to do x (or people should do x).\" What we do is to study what happens if people were rational because most of the time that is a good starting point. Then we further study what would happen if people were less rational or they were inattentive in a rational way etc.. Sometimes what we obtain under rationality is a good enough approximation of what people actually do. Sometimes it is not and weaker notions provide better fit.", "created_utc": "1610102376.0", "edited": "False", "id": "gij2e54", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_kstvea", "parent_id": "t1_giixcuo", "score": "8", "subreddit": "askphilosophy", "subreddit_id": "t5_2sc5r"}, {"author": "amhotw", "body": "I think she is still alive, do you really want her?", "created_utc": "1610095441.0", "edited": "False", "id": "giivghw", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_ksqmy6", "parent_id": "t1_giigosp", "score": "3", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i"}, {"author": "amhotw", "body": "In case you run out of cheeses one day, are you aware of this one? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulum_cheese\n\nIt ages in goatskin so it has a very unique flavor, I would recommend trying it if you are ever in Turkey.", "created_utc": "1610094854.0", "edited": "False", "id": "giiuuh8", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_kstllx", "parent_id": "t1_gii1mc6", "score": "14", "subreddit": "Cheese", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhyg"}, {"author": "amhotw", "body": "Mainly yes.

Of course, I can just as easily use non-integers etc, when I had more energy for grading, I used to do that (I remember using pi, e etc. in my grading, lol) but not anymore. Another alternative is to make the total points in an exam equal to its weight in the course, so if the exam is worth 25 percent of the total grade, it would have 25 points. This is obviously harder for the grader for the reasons above but students understand the scale of things better in this way I think. In fact, another reason to have hundreds of points is that students complain less. Like if a student gets 40 out of 100, they will complain.

To keep things simple, let's make the assumption that one of the candidates is the better choice for all votes but it is not known whether the better candidate is A or B. However, some of the voters are better informed about the better candidate. You can imagine each voter receives some signal that is correlated with the true state of the world (the better candidate) but some voters' signals have a higher correlation. (Everyone knows the joint distribution of signals and states.) Then, in the equilibrium, less informed voters stay at home and let the better informed voters vote for the better candidate and this behavior is socially optimal as well. This is actually observed in the US elections data: Many voters vote for the president (because who doesn't know about the candidates after almost two years of campaigning) and maybe also the governor but they don't vote down the ballot because they don't really know the small name candidates and hence they defer to better informed voter's judgement, even though once they are in the booth, there is no cost of voting for the other guys as well.\n\nOf course, the most crucial assumption in the model I described above is that there is one candidate that is better for all voters, even though not everyone knows who that is. If this is the case, you can and you should defer to better informed people's judgement, for your own benefit before anything else. However, there are some discussions where reasonable people can disagree about which side to take. In those cases, unless you feel you are informed enough to form your own judgement, you might find a reasonable person with whom you agree on as many issues as possible (among issues you feel confident to make your own judgement) and take on their position for the issues on which you don't have your own judgement (at least not a very confident one). This assumes either that the judgement about answers to other questions can actually be directly deduced from the answers about which you agree (and you are unable to make the logical deduction because you are not logically omniscient while this hypothetical reasonable person can understand the necessary implications) or that the moral tastes of people are correlated across dimensions (if you agree on x and y, you are likely to agree on z as well). Further, if we take the correlation of moral tastes story, you can even make a list of these reasonable people you often agree (and there are many ways for you to make this list but I won't go into that) and then for each new issue you consider, you can let them vote: If there are n of them, and if k>n/2 of them think x is true, then you take x as true, at least until you decide for your own reasons that it is not. Again, this suggestion is only for things that can be points of disagreements and the members of the set of points of disagreements are themselves points of disagreements: Can reasonable people disagree about the definition of knowledge (or are some of them clearly right and some of wrong)? I am sure reasonable people will disagree about answers to this question. Thus the problem of finding problems seems to have a recursive nature.

(Most professors are overworked, many don't care enough to fail a lot of people as it means low evaluations etv., which matters especially for the untenured foks.)\n\nLike, I'll have students who supposedly took a number of classes that teach and employ certain mathematical tools that are a prerequisites for my class (these are clearly stated in the enrollment page -so they literally can't take my class if they haven't satisfied those requirements-, the syllabus, first lectures...).

Hell, no; you shouldn't have been here if you don't know these and I said so several times.\n\nSome of those students even asked me if they should apply for PhD programs in my field and their prospects etc. and I very clearly said no. Saying anything else would be a lie; they don't come to me for a therapy, I have to tell them facts. Obviously, they are completely free to ignore me. Some of them should ignore me, I am sure there have been people I misjudged. (Hell, I was the laziest student ever, all my undergraduate education I only did homeworks in a grand total of one class because it was the only class where homeworks were to my taste. Based on my records, I am sure many of my professors didn't think I would get a PhD.) I still feel I need to be honest, what good would it do to say \"you are doing great\" to everyone when they clearly aren't doing great. PhD application is not the same thing as major/minor choice but most students I interact with are seniors so they are more worried about PhD and stuff.", "created_utc": "1607494082.0", "edited": "False", "id": "gf55laq", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_k9f725", "parent_id": "t3_k9f725", "score": "1", "subreddit": "AskAcademia", "subreddit_id": "t5_2sakj"}, {"author": "amhotw", "body": "Sorry to inform you but probably the last polymath ever was von Neumann.

In a bargaining game, we study equilibrium outcomes, where agents maximize utility given what they believe. One of the most important properties of a social choice function is strategy-proofness.

As this became a common practice at least about 40 years ago, DMVs accepted the automatic transmission cars for the driving test. This made the differences larger.

I think the way the question is posed makes it more difficult to answer and it would anyways be a difficult question in any form. As far as I understand, spoken language is a result of the constraints human communication faced, not the result of a preference. If you imagine people walking around in a forest, perhaps chasing an animal, it is very difficult to maintain signed language and it is not really helpful with the hunt. Similarly, if you are spending sufficient amount of time on trees, you don't really want to \"waste\" your hand with signing. So in some sense, the communication had to be auditory rather than visual. (There are several discussions of signed language origins in Fitch's book in chapter 13. I don't think I can do them justice here so I just wanted to point at that.)\n\nFor example, Hockett has this list of features a sufficiently complex system of communication need to be successful in the nature, I find most of them very reasonable. The first one says that it involves voice production and sound perception. Even if we ignore the first one, second is \"everyone close enough can understand the signal\". IMO the second feature basically necessitates the first one because visual perception require people around to be looking at the (direction of the) signer, unlike listening, where you just hear any sound from any direction. Of course, we don't have to care about his rules but I think most of them are well justified.\n\nAlso, basically every animal makes some sounds and process them (probably partially related to ease of use in many situations) and it is true of our LCA with chimps. (Here I am assuming by we you meant Homo Sapiens, not all animals.) However, it looks like the reason our larynx descended has more to do with sounding like a larger animal than more effective communication. A lower larynx is also necessary for many of the sounds we make. So the solution to another problem helped with the ability of making different sounds. Apparently there are animals (deers, big cats, koalas I think) whose larynx descend when they are making sounds. However, they cannot be trained to make all the sounds we make. So the nerves to control the vocal tract must have developed recently and these nerves and their corresponding regions have more to do with the language than the larynx. (These are mostly from Fitch's chapter 8.) This is just one example of a very complex system that together make spoken language possible but I wanted to mention this to highlight the complexity and its relation with the external factors that we wouldn't necessarily relate to the language.", "created_utc": "1595478791.0", "edited": "False", "id": "fyy6yet", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_hw445s", "parent_id": "t3_hw445s", "score": "5", "subreddit": "linguistics", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhos"}, {"author": "amhotw", "body": "I actually read some of the earlier chapters of the Romance languages book.
