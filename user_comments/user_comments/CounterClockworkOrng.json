I don't believe in ghosts, but this is something my mother believes happened while we were staying at an old family cottage.\n\nSo for context; my Grandfather grew up in the west and during that time Ireland was very old fashioned - even more so in rural areas of course - a lot of times if people had a mental illness that would be easily treatable nowadays, they were just sent to a mental hospital for the rest of their lives.\n\nThis happened to my great-grandmother (my grandfather's mother) - she had postpartum depression after she had my grandfather's younger brother and she was sent away to a mental hospital where she was heavily medicated and stayed there until the day she died (around the time my dad was a small child).\n\nMy grandfather and his brother moved out of this cottage the family had been staying in and moved in with their aunt as their dad was working and didn't have time to take care of them.\n\nPeople in the village called them \"the orphans\" because the mother was sent away and the dad was always working and not living with them.\n\nAnyways - fast forward 60-70 years when my parents moved into the cottage with me, I was 2 or 3 - they were both born and brought up in Dublin, but moved to the US for work then moved back to Ireland during the tiger and briefly stayed in the old cottage my grandfather had spent his early childhood in until his mother was sent away.\n\nSo I was an only child and I'd be playing with my toys and talking to myself, as you do. Oftentimes my mum or dad would come into the room and find toys scattered eveywhere - they'd ask what happened and I kept telling them that it was the lady in the black dress that did it.\n\nOne day I asked my dad to get a toy down from a high up place that I couldn't reach - he asked me how it got there, I told him that the lady in the black dress put it there.\n\nBasically (apparently) I was playing with this \"lady in the black dress\" all the time - and my granny (not related, mother's mother) believed it was the spirit of my great grandmother trying to play with me because she didn't get to spend time with her own children.\n\n\nTL;DR my great-grandmother's ghost played with me and my toys because she was sent to a mental hospital her whole life due to postpartum depression and didn't get to spend time with her own children.", "created_utc": "1659151824.0", "edited": "1659230291.0", "id": "ii7soiz", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_wbfic0", "parent_id": "t3_wbfic0", "score": "51", "subreddit": "ireland", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhb9"}, {"author": "CounterClockworkOrng", "body": "\"A Mayo Shower\" - what my dad calls it", "created_utc": "1659143294.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ii7bhq1", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_wbg0re", "parent_id": "t3_wbg0re", "score": "3", "subreddit": "CasualIreland", "subreddit_id": "t5_i25jp"}, {"author": "CounterClockworkOrng", "body": "Naw, been kicked out before for it and friends have too - for just sitting on the benches outside on a quiet day btw.\n\nAlso, if you're drinking on the grass, security will come up to ya and tell you to put it away - also ask for a student card often.\n\nAlso, crowd of wankers working in Pav too, just wanted to throw that out there", "created_utc": "1659109748.0", "edited": "1659116919.0", "id": "ii537n2", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_wb6gng", "parent_id": "t1_ii52da1", "score": "7", "subreddit": "Dublin", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r1hz"}, {"author": "CounterClockworkOrng", "body": "Second this, there are many Brazilians in my country and they're very easy to impress \n\nMe: Ola, Muito Bem \n\nBrazilians: \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd29", "created_utc": "1659058285.0", "edited": "1659063327.0", "id": "ii2j8fg", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_waj0j1", "parent_id": "t1_ii2avjg", "score": "108", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "CounterClockworkOrng", "body": "The 2026 world cup will only give 3 extra spots for Euro teams btw - so it's still going to be a challenge to qualify", "created_utc": "1659027557.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ii0gcqo", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_wacmah", "parent_id": "t3_wacmah", "score": "3", "subreddit": "coybig", "subreddit_id": "t5_3fqr1"}, {"author": "CounterClockworkOrng", "body": "Imagine those yokes hoppin on the Luas", "created_utc": "1659019486.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ihzvg2o", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_wa8ejt", "parent_id": "t1_ihzu6ei", "score": "40", "subreddit": "ireland", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhb9"}, {"author": "CounterClockworkOrng", "body": "*Keep my records out your fucking mouth!*", "created_utc": "1659019302.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ihzuznm", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_wa9o7c", "parent_id": "t1_ihzu6r8", "score": "22", "subreddit": "entertainment", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh0f"}, {"author": "CounterClockworkOrng", "body": "Ngl, it kinda blew my mind when I realised that this was an original song made for the episode - always assumed it was a cover of some classic barbershop quartet song", "created_utc": "1658977994.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ihxzxi9", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_w9wn1v", "parent_id": "t3_w9wn1v", "score": "5", "subreddit": "TheSimpsons", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rhs5"}, {"author": "CounterClockworkOrng", "body": "I see, thanks for the advise mate - hopefully you'll find somewhere that suits you too", "created_utc": "1658967986.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ihxdqqb", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_w95up1", "parent_id": "t1_ihxbuip", "score": "1", "subreddit": "TEFL", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qq76"}, {"author": "CounterClockworkOrng", "body": "I see, well I know it's a good market, but I've actually no interest in working in Asia - hopefully it's not the same elsewhere", "created_utc": "1658967050.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ihxblma", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_w95up1", "parent_id": "t1_ihxamvn", "score": "1", "subreddit": "TEFL", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qq76"}, {"author": "CounterClockworkOrng", "body": "I worked delivery for a year, fucking pain dealing with some customers - fucking tell em, guy!

I talked to a Belarusian retired lawyer 4/5 days a week to practice Russian and she was always on time and commited. We chose a topic to talk about then prepared a short essay to read aloud the next day in our TL (this activity kind of burned me out though ngl, which I'll talk about later).\n- don't treat the app like Tinder and avoid people who do so - fyi, if you are a female, you can change the settings to only be viewable by other females if you are tired of getting a barrage of thirsty messages.\n- the best case is if you becomes friends with someone and add them on WhatsApp/any other social media platform you use daily. Just texting them/sending audios in your TL about things you would talk about with your friends improves your conversation levels a lot\n- try to use Audio messages instead of texting if you can, usually when people learn a language it's to speak to people in it irl, not to text them irl (which would be kinda weird..), so don't forget to practice your speaking.\n- out of the 10 people you are talking to now, you might only be talking to 2 of them by next week - some people just disappear, some return only every few days, some get busy or they quit from burn out or boredom, some just delete the app - it's fine to talk to several new people a day as long as you are practicing your TL.\n\n*Activities*\n\n- Just make a friend \n\nGenerally I would say making genuine friends with a couple of people who you can talk to daily in your TL is the best strategy - this process will happen naturally of course if you have similar interests, chemistry together etc.  Forcing \"meetings\" or \"practice sessions\" starts to feel more like a chore. Unless you need to learn a new language for your career by a certain time, you shouldn't go overboard with these types of things as it can burn you out - remember to enjoy yourself.\n\n- Video calls\n\nWhen I do video calls - maybe this is controversial but it's helped me and I find it one of the more fun, less tedious activities - is for both of you to speak in your TL (e.g I speak Spanish, they Speak English) - then we correct eachother as we go along - then switch so I speak in my NL and so do they and you can ask eachother to repeat something/explain something you didn't understand. Then finally perhaps if it's a really productive call, we will speak in only English then only Spanish etc.\n\n- teaching exchange \n\nI've also tried teaching exchange with textbooks - so they go through a chapter of a basic textbook with me then I do so with one in English - to be honest I kind of dreaded these calls, because I would struggle to explain some things in English, you find yourself wanting to say \"it's just *like that* okay..I dunno\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\" - I'm not a teacher and usually the other person feels the same strain too when they are trying to teach. I normally try to pay attention as best I can out of respect, but your mind wanders and you can get bored, just like a regular class in school - they can feel the same way too when you are trying to teach them English. So usually this strategy doesn't last more than a few sessions as we both get sick of it - if you are someone who loves this concept and can teach and pay attention well and can find someone who's the same - enjoy!\n\n- Preparing short essays in your TL\n\nLike I mentioned earlier I would prepare a short essay in a topic on Russian - something simple, like talking about my family, my job, my education etc. - but was very inefficient with this activity in hindsight - because I was just a beginner in Russian and 90% of my essay was just words I had to look up. I would be just pronouncing these long ass difficult words I had never seen and then moving on. I believe she got more benefit out of this activity since her English was a higher level. As I think this activity suits B1+ learners better, avoid if you are A1/A2 like I was - try to write a essay with the vocabulary you know (which you shouldn't have enough of as an A1 Learner) - if you have to search a new word, make a flashcard of it or write it down somewhere so it won't be lost afterwards. Finally, give eachother tips on grammar and pronunciation AFTER you have each read your essay - constantly interrupting to correct eachother makes it more difficult - I wrote notes on any corrections while they were reading their essay and then went over these mistakes/corrections when they were finished.\n\nI'll try to think of some more if I can. I'm no expert, this has just been my experience, please reply if you've any questions.
