I used slats from an old Ikea bedframe to cover the radiator, and the leftover pieces I cut down from the ivar shelves to make braces to secure the top to the wall.

I also have a 26+5 baby who is now 40 weeks, and he also had a brain bleed (severe\u2014much much worse than what you described). My baby developed hydrocephalus and it was terrifying when he got diagnosed. But fortunately it\u2019s not turned out as scary as I thought. He got one tap, which is basically a long needle in the fontanelle to draw out excess fluid. It took 10 min and was done at his bedside. The doctors expected him to need another one, but as he grew, and the blood in his brain broke up, the fluid found a way to flow and he didn\u2019t need another tap so far. Our neurosurgeon told us that he has a super low chance of needing a shunt or any other surgical intervention. This was totally unexpected, based on the severity of his bleed and the hydrocephalus in 2 ventricles. Even if he did/does end up needing a shunt, once the neuro showed it to see I was so much less afraid. It\u2019s so small and unobtrusive. The doctor told me my son would have a wonderful life even with this diagnosis and if he needs surgery or not, and I believe that. If there\u2019s a neurosurgeon you can speak to I highly recommend it, they are so knowledgeable and really helped me understand my baby\u2019s prospects more than the neonatologists.

Floridian here and after 10 years in NYC I finally can say I have internalized the statement \u201cThere's no such thing as bad weather, only bad clothes.\u201d I regularly walked 30 min to work in winter and I bike year round. I also don\u2019t make a lot of money so I have some cheap recommendations:\n\n\n\u2022 go to a thrift store like Salvation Army or get onto a Facebook Buy Nothing group (your neighborhood should have one). The people are SO NICE. If you make a post requesting winter items I promise people will come to your aid! Here\u2019s what I\u2019d try to find:\n\n\n\u2022 look for base layers of natural fibers: silk, though thin, is incredibly warm. I use this as my base layer. Then, you can wear something flannel perhaps or a turtleneck shirt. Then, the game changer for me, cashmere sweater. They\u2019re so warm and soft and the best. Super expensive normally, so I always scour thrift shops. Also if you ever travel to warmer states like Florida they\u2019ll have them by the tons at thrift stores, even cheaper than here.\n\n\n\u2022 on really cold days, I\u2019ll add a zip up down vest. If you can\u2019t find at thrift store Uniqlo sells one for about $50. In general I agree with the Uniqlo suggestions but it can add up! And most layers no one ever sees so I don\u2019t care if they\u2019re ugly \ud83d\ude05\n\n\n\u2022 then, a down coat OR if I\u2019ve layered really well I\u2019ll often use a thin, quality raincoat over top\u2014this really keeps the heat in, and it\u2019s less bulky when I\u2019m gonna be active like walking long distance or biking.\n\n\n\u2022 on really brutal days or actively snowing days I have emergency ski pants lol. They\u2019re like a coat for legs. Waterproof outer layer, fleece lined, maybe down filled? Again, thrift find. Then change to normal pants at work.\n\n\n\u2022 also at thrift store\u2014look for wool-lined leather gloves\n\n\n\u2022 invest in good wool socks and good boots. Never ever wear cotton socks. Cotton gets colder when wet; wool gets warmer!\n\n\n\u2022 you need a hat and scarf. Again, I always try to get cashmere. I\u2019ve even made beanies out of old sweaters when super broke \n\n\n\u2022 you will get hot while walking if you\u2019re layered properly! I recommend dressing to where you feel\nslightly chilly when you walk outside. That way you won\u2019t overheat and have to strip on your way to work. It helps if you have layers you can just unzip or loosen like the down vest \n\n\nYou will get used to it, but the first winter might feel rough! Hang in there. You\u2019ll slowly hack this and be right at home in no time \ud83d\ude42\n\nETA: formatting", "created_utc": "1662465209.0", "edited": "1662465424.0", "id": "inawykt", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_x6urmh", "parent_id": "t3_x6urmh", "score": "1", "subreddit": "AskNYC", "subreddit_id": "t5_2uqch"}, {"author": "manmanatee", "body": "Aragorn is such a badass name.

There\u2019s just no good answer for what to do, and now I understand why people on this forum have said the last few weeks are the hardest. \n\nI hope that soon you get to see some positive change, and that he comes home before too long.

My baby was born at 26+5, and is now a little over 10 weeks old and still in the NICU. We did have a moment when he was about 3 weeks old where his heart rate was very high for a couple of days, here\u2019s what I can remember about what was going on at that time:\n\n\u2022 he had a PDA in his heart\u2014it closed on its own later\u2014they did an echocardiogram when he had the high heart rate but unclear if pda caused it. \n\n\u2022 he was on endomethycin for the PDA, as well as caffeine for Brady\u2019s and probably other medicines too. I have a note \u201chigh heart rate might be caused by medicines\u201d but again, not sure if that was why. \n\n\u2022 we had recently found out he has hydrocephalus due to a brain bleed; he got a tap a week after the high heart rate, but by then heart rate was normal again   \n\n\u2022 not sure when, but at some point they also put him on antibiotics as a preemptive measure\u2014turned out to be nothing   \n\n\u2022 soon after this, after much begging and pleading, we were allowed to do skin to skin and our son vastly improved after that. His nurse specifically said he was doing better after skin to skin. His heart rate went back to normal and he needed less oxygen.   \n\n\u2022 if you\u2019re in the US it\u2019s apparently uncommon to use probiotics but we had a doctor who started them at this point (worries about his swollen belly + he was getting off TPN). It helped tremendously and he thankfully never has had any digestive issues.   \n\n\nThe high heart rate resolved on its own for my baby after a day or two, but it was very scary! The first month or so was absolutely terrifying, but we started to have more and more boring days, and even though he is still on CPAP and has complications from his IVH he is doing so well, has gotten so big and strong, and is such a joy. Any questions about what I\u2019ve written or my experience, feel free to reply!

I get what you mean about comparing your feelings to hers. Your feelings are not minor! In addition to worrying about your baby, you\u2019ve also had to worry about your fianc\u00e9e. That\u2019s huge. Before our son was born, while my partner was hospitalized for preeclampsia, I had horrifying thoughts of going home without either of them. This is something that will take a long time to get over. And putting on a brave face, I think, is absolutely the right thing to do in the midst of the crisis. But please don\u2019t feel like you have to do that forever.\n\nI think it\u2019s amazing that you\u2019re thinking about how to show your emotions as a man, especially as you are going to be the #1 male role model for your son. Sitting in the NICU I\u2019ve overheard a mom say to her baby boy, \u201cdon\u2019t cry, daddy won\u2019t like that!\u201d which is just so sad to hear. I work with children and over the years I\u2019ve seen little boys stuff their emotions down out of fear of looking weak or because their parents told them boys don\u2019t cry. But being sad is a normal part of being human, and boys deserve to have the full range of their humanity. I feel so hopeful for these new generations of boys who will not be raised with such hurtful limitations.\n\nYou\u2019ve been through something that can either fortify your emotional strength and give you new power to draw from as you go through the parenting journey, or make you shut down and be cut off from emotions. Imo it will be more healing in the long run to let yourself feel what you feel, without guilt or comparison, so you can use these feelings to connect with your fianc\u00e9e and son and even yourself. \n\nI hope things get better fast for your family! The first days are the absolute worst, it\u2019s so hard to come to terms with, but eventually you will find a new normal and get to hold your sweet baby and bond with him. You\u2019re going to be so happy when you discover the ways that only you can comfort him. Wishing you an uneventful stay and lots of happier days.

I feel for you so much; these past two years have been so difficult and draining and this is just one more layer that\u2019s made it even harder. The covid vaccine is the first vaccine I\u2019ve gotten, because I was raised like you. For a long time I\u2019ve felt like my mom was incorrect (based on a lot of other beliefs she has, understanding how to find more legitimate sources, and her mental health generally) but I didn\u2019t really have a good reason to go get the vaccines I missed as a kid, and I felt overwhelmed at starting. I also have a lot of fear of medical stuff so I just started to avoid it. I realized before bathe covid vaccine came out that I wasn\u2019t as afraid of needles as I thought (bc of other medical things) so that helped remove the fear. Then I felt like whatever negative effects people got from the vaccine were far rarer than the very scary effects of getting covid. Plus I feel very strongly about the community protection aspect and wanted to do my part. Finally, because we were trying to have a baby I knew I needed to be extra protected from covid (I\u2019ve pretty much not ever stopped wearing a mask indoors and still limit social engagement). \nOnce I got the vaccine I felt reassured that I wasn\u2019t gonna drop dead from a vaccine. So I went and got the TDAP vaccine which is recommended for being around newborns. I\u2019ll probably get the flu vaccine this year and I\u2019ve gotten the covid booster shot. I still have doubts in the back of my mind about \u201cbig pharma\u201d, I know there\u2019s a kernel of truth, everything in this hellhole is about profit. But well my partner and I have not gotten covid yet (again, we didn\u2019t use the vaccine as a silver bullet and just go wild after).

How he is positioned, doing physical therapy (they tap his chest and back with a little plastic mallet\u2014scary the first time I saw it!), suctioning him as needed, letting his feeding tube vent so gas can escape, massaging his belly and butt so he poops more easily (straining to poop can cause Brady\u2019s and desats), and overall just having a calm atmosphere where he can rest. With the best nurses, I see them tackle all the underlying discomforts that might make it harder to breathe, and that way the oxygen support is just the minimum he needs. Worth noting that his neonatologist said a difference of 10% oxygen or so isn\u2019t going to harm him, which made me slightly more comforted by the less attentive nurses who just blast oxygen at him.

I have trained myself to ask \u201cis this typical of preemies his age?\u201d when confronted with new information and also to ask \u201cdoes this change his treatment today?\u201d Usually the answer has been yes, this is common and no, as of today he\u2019s actually doing fine and we\u2019re just gonna monitor.

A few days ago I posted to ask if I should push for kangaroo care for my 26 +5 baby, now 29 +3. Later that day a horrible nurse (like, has been taking poor care of our baby) told the nurse manager that she thought he wasn\u2019t ready for kangaroo care, in a totally dismissive and rude way. I was so crushed and spent the night sobbing. Yesterday we walked in and the nurse manager waved us over and said she talked to his nurse of the day, who we love, and they had made a plan to do it as soon as his picc line came out later that day. Around 1:30 pm my partner got to do skin to skin and he not only was ready, he stayed peacefully sleeping and eating on her her for almost 3 hours \ud83d\ude2d Before putting him back in the isolette, I was able to hold him in blankets. It was the greatest joy I\u2019ve ever felt. Now he really feels like our baby. The nurse said that this is the best part of her job and she took so many photos for us and was so sweet and supportive. If you are wanting to try kangaroo care I recommend talking to a nurse like that, someone who is really confident taking care of your baby and knows how to get the baby\u2019s best. Someone who will not be phased by moving the baby around and whose opinion you trust. Thank you again for all the support! \ud83d\udc97 we\u2019d be lost without this community!\n\nETA: he is on cpap with some breathing support (25 bpm) and is now fed strictly through feeding tube.

Another nurse we liked was one who also went above and beyond. Our baby hadn\u2019t been stooling and it was worrying us a lot. This nurse gave him a really thorough massage and suppository and finally he went. Other nurses had just done a cursory massage, but she made sure he had the best chance of moving his bowels. Finally I really appreciate it when I ask for something (for example, to change his diaper during care or that his mouth be swabbed with milk during his feeding thru tube) and the nurse remembers and does it again or at least asks me.

I prefer an inquiry based style of program, where it\u2019s not someone just telling you a bunch of facts, but rather, guiding a group of people how to look at a work of art and make meaning together while also layering in information about the artist\u2019s life, career, context, and intentions. This way you have a tool set to help you look more closely and appreciate works of art you\u2019re drawn to. Since it sounds like you have a systematic approach to your studies, you might like to learn about frameworks for art interpretation.

Plus you can save the artists:\n\nhttps://www.artsy.net/artist/lucian-freud\n\nYou might also like google arts and culture. You can store artworks, make folders, and there\u2019s cool interactive stuff like quizzes and learning tools:\n\nhttps://artsandculture.google.com\n\n\nYour post made me so happy!
