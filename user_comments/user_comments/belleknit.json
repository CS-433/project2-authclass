To begin, I did really, really well in my French and Italian classes in school. I thrived in my language classes, and the language department became kind of my \"happy place\" in high school. So I had a really positive experience there. \n\nBut past that, I am not \"wired\" for Krashen's methods. I *like* grammar! I like to understand the mechanics behind my words and sentences.

But that's taking into account the entire 15 weeks. Over time, I've decreased the use of academic materials (for the last five weeks, things like vocab and grammar have only taken \\~15% of my time) and focused more on listening, watching TV, reading, and speaking/writing. And I intend to continue to add more and more input and output activities and decrease the academic activities, because I've gotten my passive skills to a B1 level and my active skills are still probably A2, but catching up quickly. I'll still do book work, but now that listening to podcasts, watching TV,  and reading are more enjoyable, I want to have more fun with the language! \n\nI feel like I read somewhere that Krashen's methodologies are really best for people learning English.

But most of the Bates children at least attend Clown College, and the sons-in-law are all either educated in some way or are skilled workers\n* On the sons-in-law: Gil chose the long game with his daughters. Sure, he's not JB, running some kind of ersatz empire of the unemployed, but his married kids all appear to be financially independent\n* They have real businesses, like the boutique and Josie's company. Not a bunch of LLCs to shuffle money\n* Sons-in-law appear to be way more progressive with their wives, but again, the term \"progressive\" is a huge stretch. They just don't constantly act like conventional headships (things like childcare, food prep, working for the boutique, etc.)\n* At the end of the day, they come across like happy, loving people\n\n**Reasons the Bateses are no better than the Duggars:**\n\n* Confederate room ([see here](https://www.freejinger.org/topic/31525-bates-25-moving-the-kids-out-of-the-house/page/11/))\n* Sister-momming\n* Taking money from teenage Lawson\n* Not allowing Erin to go to a real college\n* Their set of lost kids (the youngest 5)\n* Two of the sons being at the Rotunda on Jan. 6\n* Game night incident ([see here](https://www.reddit.com/r/BringingUpBates/comments/qxvkvb/disturbing_content_via_carlins_ig_story_tonight/))\n* **Gil Bates is a member of the IBLP Board of Directors** (thank you u/wakeofgrace for this reminder)\n* **Lawson trying to get Fundie Fridays banned from YouTube with copyright strikes** (thanks u/PsychoSemantics)\n* They're still a bunch of Fundies\n\nTl;dr: the Bateses play the game beautifully well, and I do think that some of the second generation couples appear to be relaxing things to the point that I wonder what *their* kids will be like, but they're still...them.

As a native speaker. \n\nSame goes for writing. That says: \n\n>I can write clear, smoothly-flowing text in an appropriate style. I can write complex letters, reports or articles which present a case with an effective logical structure which helps the recipient to notice and remember significant points. I can write summaries and reviews of professional or literary works.\n\nWas the fact that I struggled with college papers a sign that I didn't have the skills to qualify as a C2 in my native language? Does being good at writing copy negate that? \n\nAnd as someone with a degree from a well-regarded school, I was really worried! \n\nAnyway, after a fantastic back-and-forth where I learned a ton (thanks to u/xanthic_strath for putting up with me!), I realized that I was totally off-base.

This is a telenovela aimed at learners. It's from the 1990s, so depending on your age, it's either TV as you remember it, an adorably dated glimpse at the past, or \"like, so old.\" But I loved it! It's 52 episodes. \n* Dreaming Spanish. This is not my favorite, but some people *love* it. It's immersion-style videos at a range of levels. They discuss a variety of topics (I've watched videos on everything from Spanish history to plastic surgery). If you like YouTube, you'll like this. If you're in my boat and vlogs are torture for you, you'll likely get bored with the more personal videos and prefer stuff like Spanish history. \n* *Extra* (aka Extra en Espa\u00f1ol). It's a knockoff of *Friends*, made on a very low budget, but it's only 13 episodes and it's meant for learners. \n* Language Transfer. A 90-episode podcast that breaks down Spanish grammar and gives you a way to think about Spanish, rather than just studying from books. It made a huge difference for me!\n* *101 Conversations in Simple Spanish* (and the other books in the series) by Olly Richards. It's a story-based approach to contemporary spoken Spanish and a good way to dip your toe into reading and listening. \n* *Practice Makes Perfect: Verbs.* It's a Spanish grammar workbook that covers the majority of verb tenses you need to know. I worked my way through the whole book (ok, I skipped every other exercise and a handful of true/false-type exercises). Very useful. I did one chapter a day for 26 days, but I wouldn't recommend that. I recommend doing Unit I (one chapter a day, or one every other day, or one over two days), taking a break, doing Unit II (same as Unit I), taking a break, and then doing Unit III over time--that's where you get into some of the more confusing compound tenses and whatnot. \n* Mango Languages. This is available for free through a lot of public libraries in the US. It's speaking drills. I personally find the speaking drills in Mango far more effective than the speaking exercises in Duolingo. \n\nI'm not doing all of this at once. It's been staggered over time and mixed with activities like Duolingo. But I find that each resource has been useful in its own way.

Your eyes and face shape mean little to nothing. I'd even argue that your cheekbones don't mean a whole lot. \n3.
