This occurs at higher pO2 which is why it\u2019s great for loading of O2 at the lungs on the hemoglobin. At low pO2 and periods of tissue hypoxia, hemoglobin has lower affinity for O2, favoring the T state (taut) of the hemoglobin molecule to which O2 cannot bind as well and promoting more unloading of O2 at the tissues. \n\nFor lactic acidosis / high PCO2, the high level of H+ indeed pushes O2 off of the hemoglobin molecule. You can also think of it like the acidic solution interacts with the hemoglobin molecule and stabilizes the T state of the hemoglobin molecule. Since the T state is stabilized, this again promotes unloading of O2 at the tissues and the CO2 will instead be carried on the hemoglobin and eliminated via hyperventilation.", "created_utc": "1637070899.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hkupybq", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_quvpps", "parent_id": "t1_hktzmir", "score": "1", "subreddit": "medicalschool", "subreddit_id": "t5_2re2p"}, {"author": "ambrosiadix", "body": "I updated my post because I think I originally got things wrong, but your system sounds the same as mine aside from the passing grade.", "created_utc": "1637023251.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hksijgi", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_quu9h5", "parent_id": "t1_hksfb7l", "score": "1", "subreddit": "medicalschool", "subreddit_id": "t5_2re2p"}, {"author": "ambrosiadix", "body": "We get two end of block averages. \n\n1.

Mid-high SES Black people tend to have extended families and immediate relatives that are extremely mixed in income. As in, a mid-high SES URM applicant\u2019s household could be high in income (but they typically barely have actual wealth accumulating assets, possibly knee deep in debt, house may be on the verge of foreclosure...but that\u2019s a deeper topic) but they are more likely to have the rest of their family never make it out of a lower-income status (\"the hood\"). And they tend to have high levels of interaction with these relatives instead of separating themselves from them.  \n>  \n>Research has shown that middle class Black people have actually been found to be more likely to live in low income neighborhoods compared to middle class white or Asian people. And what\u2019s even more shocking is that middle class Black people have also been found to live in neighborhoods that are even lower in income than a WORKING CLASS white family would be living in.  \n>  \n>Here\u2019s an article better detailing this: [https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.nytimes.com/2015/06/25/upshot/middle-class-black-families-in-low-income-neighborhoods.amp.html](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.nytimes.com/2015/06/25/upshot/middle-class-black-families-in-low-income-neighborhoods.amp.html)  \n>  \n>This impacts A LOT of things. Meaning that even though their household is high in income, they still live in a poorer neighborhood which impacts outcomes including the quality of school districts.  \n>  \n>A good example is Prince George\u2019s County, Maryland. I know many people who grew up here. It is the \u201cwealthiest\u201d predominantly Black county in the United States...yet their public school system is absolute shit.
