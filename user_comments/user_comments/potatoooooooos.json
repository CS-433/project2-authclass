When I was in 10th grade, I applied to the University of Minnesota. On their website, they mentioned that there were 500 spots but most people who apply get in. My high school counselor told me I'd get accepted in  heartbeat.\n\nThe same counselor also told me that schools try to keep this program under wraps, because public schools get a certain amount of amount of money for each student, so when they leave to do PSEO, they take that money out of the high school and give it to the University. Which is shitty but their funding is also shitty. This explains why as little as 500 people were applying each year and almost everyone was getting in, but that particular year word must've gotten out as there were around 1,200 applicants.\n\nSince my counselor hyped me up so much, when I got the letter I assumed I was in. I was actually put on a wait list, and would only be accepted if those people who were originally chose decide to go through with the program, preference given to seniors. Also, chances were I'd only be accepted part time so I'd still have to go to high school. I crumpled up that letter and threw it on the floor. \n\nMy pride was hurt and I still wanted to do PSEO, so I just applied to the local community college, got in, and started doing class placement testing. Shortly after I got a letter from UMN saying that I have been accepted FULL TIME! My family and I were the people in this video when I got that letter. \n\nMy mom saved the original rejection letter.

This was a two day project, which started with them removing the curtains so they could cut a bigger hole for the window. They put the curtains on my bed and I just left them there because lazy and also they were coming back the next day to finish the window. \n\nThat night, the boyf and I were getting busy over over FaceTime, and I came all over the curtains laying on my bed. I'm not kidding, I'm a squirter so they were soaked. Because I'm lazy, as mentioned earlier, I just threw them on the floor and continued with the virtual sexy times.\n\nFast forward to the next afternoon, I'm sitting in my living room, waiting for my landlord and his handy man to finish my window. The curtains are completely forgotten about at this point. They have the door open and I can hear very clearly everything they're saying. When they were close to finishing, I heard one of them ask where the curtains were.

Then soon I couldn't hang out with anyone they didn't approved of, I had to abruptly stop talking to my BEST FRIEND, without any explanation as to why, because my parents had informed my teachers that I couldn't have any communication with her. This was all because we were really loud in gym class and my gym teacher told them at conferences that we were trouble when we were together. Once I made a Facebook, they had to approve of everyone I added as a friend and they had my password so they could oversee my conversations. Not only could I not text or FB message anyone after 10, they couldn't message ME! If they did I got yelled at. I had and still have a problem making friends.\n\nIt became so SO much worse when I had my first crush in 9th grade. Let's call him Steve. He'd given me his ipod to take home and I forgot to bring it back for like a week or so. My stepdad (SD) read the FB messages from Steve reminding me to bring his ipod to school, and SD yelled at me because I just \"had to have something of Steve's\" what? Anyway, now he knows about Steve so this is bad news for the both of us. I asked him to Sadie Hawkins and had to get approval from SD to go. Imagine how nervous you would get before giving a speech in front of your class, multiply that by 10, and that was me in high school whenever I asked to go somewhere. Somehow, he allowed me to go. We took a picture there together since they encouraged couples to match for the dance. Not me, but Steve made this photo his profile picture, SD saw it, and said if he didn't change it that I would be grounded because Steve is playing us off as a couple. \n\nBy now, Steve knows I have a crazy SD but somehow hasn't stopped talking to me. School is over and now I never get to see Steve because of helicopter SD. One of my friends was at my house one day and said we should go to the car show, and said all of our friends would be there, including Steve. SD agrees to take us, we get there, he see Steve, goes completely silent and gets this evil look on his face, drives friend home and as soon as she goes inside I got screamed at and grounded for the summer. For Steve, being at a car show, with our friends, 5 blocks from his house. \n\nIt didn't end there, 10th grade started a few months after that and Steve and I were still into each other. I was going to be 16 in 2 months, which meant we would officially be able to date. Somewhere in that time frame there was a retreat that we had to go to at our church for confirmation, Steve was in my confirmation group and would be at said retreat, which SD knew. The night before the retreat I was ready for bed, wearing a tank top and shorts. SD asked what I planned on bringing for pajamas to retreat, I look at my current ensemble and say probably just this, bc who the fuck cares??? and he exploded. By now I was used to him being a complete asshole about everything so I had to try really hard not to laugh at how ridiculous he was being. I looked at a spot on the wall above him because if I looked at his face, I'd lose composure. He accused me of rolling my eyes at him and told me I was no longer allowed to go to this CHURCH retreat, that was required, to confirm myself as a Catholic. Yeah. Anyway, my mom stepped in (fucking finally) and was like she's going, I went, Steve and I hung out and SD couldn't do anything about it BWAHAHAHAHAHAHA.\n\nThe story is not over. The week before my 16th birthday, the initiation day, Steve and 3 of our friends went to see In Time (the one with Justin Timberlake that kinda sucked). My mom knew who was gonna be there SD didn't ask. After the movie my friend Jake asked for a ride home, I said yes. SD comes to pick us up and is acting like a complete ass noodle to Jake for no reason, we drop him off, and in a very pissed off tone he asks \"Since when were there boys at this gathering?\" Uh since always? I'm 16 not 8 dude, come on. Anyway, long story short he finds out Steve was also there and flips his shit, calling the outing, word for word \"a double date plus 1\". Because there were two other guys and a girl. In what world does that make sense? Anyway, my punishment for this offense was that I would be grounded on my birthday (which surprisingly wasn't the first or even second time that happened), but I was allowed to date anyone but Steve on my 16th birthday. I don't think you understand how crushed I was. \n\nSo anyway, I hated my life for about 6 more months until I told my mom that I was no longer taking order from my step-dad and that she needed to start being my mom again. Miraculously, this worked in my favor. My facebook account was only accessible by me, I could text whoever I wanted whenever I wanted, I could date Steve, and I didn't have someone looking over my should 24/7. Steve and I eventually started dating, but I didn't tell SD that, I kept it a secret for several months. The first day as an official couple, we went down to that car show 5 blocks from his house, the one I got grounded a whole summer for Steve being there the year before, and made out.
