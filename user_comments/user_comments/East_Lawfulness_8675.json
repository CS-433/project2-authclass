I am new to yoga practice (today was my 15th class and I just started 7 weeks ago. I was really nervous to go because I have never done yoga and didn\u2019t know what to expect. I have done other fitness classes such as Pilates, Zumba, step, and others, but I hadn\u2019t been to any exercise class in years. I decided one day to go and I fell in love with yoga. It\u2019s really relaxing and yet invigorating. I started by specifically choosing classes that are labeled as beginners or gentle. To this day I have only attempted some harder classes like PiYo and Hot Yoga as I feel those classes are harder and a bit more intimidating in terms of the fitness level. In those advanced classes I tend to find that the class age skews to lots of slim folks in their 20s and 30s. Meanwhile the gentle classes I see overweight/new to fitness bodies and older individuals including some who are doing yoga as part of recommended physical therapy for medical conditions. In all the classes however I feel accepted. I have had some circumstances of falling, losing balance, slipping on my mat\u2026 as well of course there are many poses that are too advanced for me. However I realize that it affects no one else, it is purely an ego thing if I let it bring me down. So I just let go and smile and keep working towards being able to reach those harder poses.\n\nIn terms of what to wear, from personal experience I recommended wearing stretchy type material like leggings or bike shorts that contort with your body as you move. The first class I wore adidas joggers and it was a terrible idea lol, the cloth is heavy and thick and was hard to move in. Also I find it\u2019s more comfortable to wear a tank top or a fitted shirt\u2026 when I wore a loose t shirt, I found it was slipping and covering my face when I did positions that involve leaning forward towards the floor (like a \u201cforward fold\u201d)\n\nMy last advice is to not attend any hot yoga classes until you have an appropriate non slip mat. I found out the hard way when I slipped in my first hot yoga class\u2026 you sweat everywhere so you need a yoga mat that absorbs moisture so that you won\u2019t slip", "created_utc": "1664410927.0", "edited": "1664411143.0", "id": "iqb1qbf", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_xq26h7", "parent_id": "t3_xq26h7", "score": "1", "subreddit": "yoga", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhq6"}, {"author": "East_Lawfulness_8675", "body": "Is this also why pacing is not so favored in pediatric bradycardia as well?", "created_utc": "1664410447.0", "edited": "False", "id": "iqb0opy", "is_submitter": "True", "link_id": "t3_xql4it", "parent_id": "t1_iq9t5n5", "score": "9", "subreddit": "medicine", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhff"}, {"author": "East_Lawfulness_8675", "body": "Why is that?", "created_utc": "1664410350.0", "edited": "False", "id": "iqb0hck", "is_submitter": "True", "link_id": "t3_xql4it", "parent_id": "t1_iqakd3k", "score": "8", "subreddit": "medicine", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhff"}, {"author": "East_Lawfulness_8675", "body": "Katrina\u2019s death toll was 1800 people.. this is not going to be Katrina\u2026", "created_utc": "1664397725.0", "edited": "False", "id": "iqa7nzh", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_xqhvmz", "parent_id": "t1_iqa5guq", "score": "3", "subreddit": "florida", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh7q"}, {"author": "East_Lawfulness_8675", "body": "That makes sense.

In response, a Hindu politician, Nupur Sharma quoted hadith ( Islamic Scripture). Muslims took offense and pelted stones in many cities in India, demanding the arrest and death of Nupur Sharma. A case has since been filed against her, although quoting scriptures is not a crime. She was also suspended by her party. As for the Muslim politician, no police case or suspension. Muslims have been calling for the beheading of Nupur Sharma with slogans like \"There is only one punishment for offending the Prophet, beheading.\"\n\nIn response to this extreme fanaticism, some Hindus came out in support of Nupur Sharma. The Hindu tailor named Kanhaiya Lal in the video made a Facebook post to show his support for her. The two Muslim men in the video went to his shop posing as customers, filmed him, then beheaded him. After the crime, they made another video with weapons in hand.

Jealousy and Possessiveness. Wants to be with you constantly. Accuses you of cheating all the time. Follows you around and frequently calls. Asks friends to check up on you.\n \n2. Controlling Behavior. Constantly questions who you spend your time with, what you did/wore/said, where you went. Makes you ask permission to do certain things. Acts like you don\u2019t have the ability to make good decisions. Hides controlling behavior by pretending to be concerned for your safety.\n \n3. Quick Involvement. Six months or less before living together or engaged. Claims love at first sight. Pressure for commitment. Says you are the only one who can make him feel this way.\n \n4. Unrealistic Expectations. Compliments you in a way that makes you seems superhuman. Over-flattering. Expects you to be perfect. Says, \"I am all you need. You are all I need.\"\n \n5. Isolation. Puts down everyone you know- friends are either stupid, slutty, or you are cheating with them- family is too controlling, doesn\u2019t really love you, or you are too dependent on them. Refuses to let you use car or talk on phone. Makes it difficult for you to go to work or school. Tries to cut off all your resources.\n \n6. Blames Others for Problems. If there are problems at school or work, it is always someone else\u2019s fault. If anything goes wrong in the relationship, it is all your fault. Won\u2019t take responsibility for own behavior.\n \n7. Blames Others for Feelings. Tries to make you responsible for how they feel. \"You\u2019re making me mad.\" \"You\u2019re hurting me by not doing what I ask.\" \"I can\u2019t help being angry.\" Won\u2019t take responsibility for own feelings.\n \n8. Hypersensitivity. Easily insulted. Sees everything as a personal attack. Looks for fights. Blows things out of proportion. Unpredictable. You can never tell what will upset him.\n \n9. Disrespectful or Cruel to Others. Punishes animals or children cruelly. Insensitive to pain and suffering. Teases children until they cry. Doesn\u2019t treat others with respect. Dismissive of others\u2019 feelings.\n \n10. \"Playful\" Use of Force During Sexual Activity. Little concern over whether you want sex or not, and uses sulking or anger to manipulate you into compliance. Makes sexual or degrading jokes about you.\n \n11. Verbal Abuse of Any Kind.\n \n12. Rigid Sex Roles. Believes women are inferior to men. Unable to be a whole person without a relationship.\n \n13. Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. Sudden mood changes- like they have two personalities. One minute nice, next minute exploding. One minute happy, next minute sad.\n \n14. Past Battering. You may hear the person was abusive to someone else. They say it\u2019s a lie, or their ex was \"crazy,\" or it wasn\u2019t that bad.\n \n15. Threats of Any Kind.\n \n16. Breaking or Striking Objects. Breaks loved possessions. Beats on table with fists. Throws objects.\n \n17. Any Force During an Argument. Pushes, shoves, or physically restrains you from leaving room.\n \n18.

Dating is the trial period to learn what your lover is like and what it\u2019s like to be in a relationship with them. You have to realize that people don\u2019t really change and marriage is not a solution to a problematic relationship, because problems will only continue. I truly feel too many people feel stuck in their bad relationships and feel that marriage is the \u201cobvious next step\u201d so they just go for it even when they know it\u2019s not right. I know so many folks in bad relationships that are unhappy and yet they stay. The person you are with should make you feel beloved, cherished, happy, and vice Versa.
