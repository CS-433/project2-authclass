In concrete terms, a little less than one in five Walloons lived that year in a household that did not have an income of 1,293 euros net per month for a single person, and 2,715 euros for a household composed of two adults and two children under 14 years of age.\r  \n\r  \nThe at-risk-of-poverty rate in Wallonia, which is lower than the rate observed in Brussels (around 25%), but higher than the Flemish rate (less than 10%), remains relatively stable, with no major trend emerging, according to the Iweps.\r  \n\r  \nThe rate of persistent risk of poverty - which measures the number of people whose net equivalent household income is below the risk of poverty in the reference year, as well as in at least two of the three preceding years - stands at 14.8%.\r  \n\r  \n**\"Mostly long-term poverty\"**\r  \n\"In Wallonia, poverty is therefore overwhelmingly long-term and rarely temporary: between 8 and 9 out of 10 poor people are in a situation of persistent poverty.

Compared to other European countries, income inequalities are limited in Wallonia, mainly because of our social model combining generalised and centralised collective bargaining and extensive social security\", the Iweps adds.\r  \n\r  \nThe Gini coefficient, which measures income inequality within a population, is thus 0.236, comparable to the results achieved by the Scandinavian countries. \"However, poverty in living conditions is more marked: the Walloon rate of material and social deprivation (14.1%) is higher than the European median; housing with dampness problems, which affects 18.8% of the population, is more frequent than in many European countries and a large part of the population is excluded from employment,\" the institute stresses.\r  \n\r  \nAccording to the institute, 17% of the Walloon population lives in a very low work intensity household, while their household includes at least one person of working age.\r  \nThe Iweps also looked at the populations most at risk of poverty. Unsurprisingly, it identified tenants, who often accumulate difficulties as they have a lower income, more frequently live in damp accommodation and have to spend more on housing with a median rent of 529 euros. The difficulties of single-parent families are also highlighted, as the majority of them do not have enough savings available to meet an unexpected expense of 1,100 euros.\r  \n\r  \nFinally, poverty also affects children in particular. More than one in five live in a household below the poverty line and almost 12% of them cannot afford to replace their worn-out clothes. In contrast, the proportion of people aged 65 and over who have to go without is much lower, as a large proportion of them are homeowners without mortgages, which allows them to maintain an adequate standard of living, the institute says.\r  \n\r  \nTranslated with www.DeepL.com/Translator (free version)", "created_utc": "1665672438.0", "edited": "False", "id": "is5t0ux", "is_submitter": "True", "link_id": "t3_y30hur", "parent_id": "t3_y30hur", "score": "8", "subreddit": "belgium", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhe6"}, {"author": "Leiegast", "body": "De verschillende crises hebben aangetoond dat het systeem op cruciale momenten vierkant draait, met bevoegdheden die overal verspreid liggen, tot het onzinnige toe (hallo 8 ministers van Volksgezondheid).

Elle \u00e9tait tellement limit\u00e9e par sa peur qu'elle ne pouvait plus faire ce qu'elle voulait faire. Elle vivait dans une peur constante et avait compl\u00e8tement perdu son sentiment de s\u00e9curit\u00e9. Chaque fois que Shanti sortait, elle \u00e9tait toujours en alerte.

D'une certaine mani\u00e8re, vous continuez \u00e0 esp\u00e9rer que \u00e7a va s'arranger apr\u00e8s tout, qu'elle ne le fera pas, mais en m\u00eame temps, j'ai eu le sentiment d\u00e8s le d\u00e9but que c'\u00e9tait vraiment ce qu'elle voulait. Je me suis tr\u00e8s bien rendu compte que la fa\u00e7on dont Shanti avait d\u00fb vivre ces derni\u00e8res ann\u00e9es, en survivant, que ce n'\u00e9tait pas une option pour continuer \u00e0 vivre comme \u00e7a. \"  \n>  \n>REGARDEZ - \"Je pense que c'\u00e9tait tr\u00e8s pr\u00e9cieux pour Shanti que nous reconnaissions sa souffrance\" :  \n>  \n>Finalement, Shanti a quand m\u00eame pu faire le voyage qui lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 enlev\u00e9 en mars 2016.

Meanwhile, the Brussels government has negotiated a new loan with ING.**\n\nBelfius recently warned about Walloon public finances. The house banker fears a poor credit rating and is apprehensive about the PTB taking power after the 2024 elections. It therefore wants to be careful when granting loans to the Walloon Region. This complicates negotiations between Belfius and the Walloon Region on a new 'cashier's agreement'.\n\nBut business newspaper L'Echo now reports that Belfius is also playing the cautious card in its loan negotiations with the Brussels region. A \u20ac1 billion loan granted by Belfius to the Brussels region expires at the end of September. In the future, Belfius will only lend half that amount to Brussels. So the Brussels Region had to look for an alternative, and out came ING. Negotiations on this already took place in the spring.\n\nAccording to Finance Minister Sven Gatz (Open VLD), Belfius was mainly worried about the seventh state reform and what it would mean for the financing of Brussels. He tells L'Echo that it is rather a good thing that Brussels now works with several lenders, and not exclusively with Belfius.\n\nAccording to calculations by the Centre de recherches en \u00e9conomie r\u00e9gionale et politique \u00e9conomique (Cerpe), the capital is heading for a \u20ac15.2 billion debt by 2027 if policies remain unchanged.\n\nMinister Gatz stressed that the budget should be balanced in 2024, as agreed in the multi-year budget.

There are several draft federal laws to regulate PFASs more strictly. Some of them would aim to ban them as a product family. As we recall, PFAS are a family of about 5000 substances. It has become a lobbying issue for the entire chemical industry and Solvay is no exception.\r  \n\r  \nIn Washington DC, we pushed open the door of Open Secrets, an independent organisation whose mission is to follow the money in American politics and its effect on elections and public policy. There we met Anna Massoglia, head of writing and investigations.\r  \n\r  \nShe notes that Solvay's lobbying spending has gone way up: \"It just completely exploded from 2020 to 2021. In 2021, we saw $730,000 of Solvay's federal lobbying spending, which is more than three times what they were spending in 2020 and more than their all-time high in 2019. There has also been a fairly significant increase in the number of lobbyists that Solvay has employed. Currently they have nine, and last year they only had three.\"\r  \n\r  \nThe trend continues in 2022, where Solvay has already paid out more in the first half of the year than in 2021. 730,000 is the directly tangible part, because Solvay is actually spending much more and hiring specialist companies such as Majority Group ($180,000 in 2021) or Strategic Marketing Innovations (\u20ac110,000 in 2021). Not to mention their affiliation with the American Chemistry Council, the federation of the American chemical industry, which has allocated more than $16 million in 2021. Last year, Solvay clearly invested more than a million dollars in lobbying for the American Congress alone.\r  \n\r  \nAnd among its interests, PFAS occupies a prominent place. This official lobbying report filed by Solvay at the congress is proof of this. The specific issues of interest to Solvay include plans to regulate drinking water at the federal level or to set limits on the release of PFASs in industrial effluents.\r  \n\r  \n**A strategy similar to the tobacco industry**\n\n\r  \nErik Olson is the strategic director of the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental association. We know that there has been a huge effort on the part of many chemical companies, including Solvay, to influence bills like the PFAS action bill, which passed the House but did not pass the Senate. It's pretty clear that they have a strong interest in PFAS. Unfortunately, we're seeing a lot of pushback, a lot of efforts to try to stop strong legislation that would reduce the level of exposure to these eternal toxic chemicals. So we think that part of the strategy is very similar to what happened with the tobacco industry, which took advantage of the situation by saying that the science is not clear. There is a lot of uncertainty. We need to do more studies; we can't regulate until we do that. We see the same thing happening with PFAS. It's creating doubt where there shouldn't be any.\"\r  \n\r  \n**A lawyer turned industry's worst nightmare**\r  \n\r  \nThe legal risk for a multinational like Solvay is obvious. In the US alone, Solvay is facing 25 lawsuits. They all concern the use of PFAS. Some of them are led by lawyer Robert Bilott, known as the industry's worst nightmare. For 20 years, this lawyer fought against Dupont, another chemical company. He won $670 million in compensation for thousands of victims. His story inspired the film Dark Waters.\r  \n\r  \nToday, his fight continues throughout the United States. In his sights are the chemical giants that use PFAS. And Solvay is one of them. Robert Bilott defends states or water distributors who are facing astronomical clean-up costs.\r  \n\r  \nBut a few months ago he won his first battle with the industry: \"The court has ruled that we can bring a class action suit for millions of people who have these chemicals in their blood here in the US. And the goal is to try to scientifically verify what this PFAS mixture can do to people, in their blood. If companies are going to put these products into our world and say, \"Yes, but you don't have proof that they're harmful\". They should pay for all the scientific studies needed to confirm that. Not us.\"\r  \n\r  \nThese various legal actions also create a significant economic and reputational risk for Solvay.\n\n**Solvay's reaction**\n\n\r  \nOn 20 June 2022, Solvay announced with great fanfare its intention to abandon the use of PFAS worldwide by 2026. \"Solvay is proud of its innovative power, which enables us to constantly develop more sustainable technologies. Our new polymerisation process does not require fluorosurfactants while retaining the specific properties of our products that our customers need in the manufacture of critical materials needed for a sustainable society...\"\r  \n\r  \nLast July, the multinational even invited three French-speaking Belgian journalists to visit the Spinetta Marengo plant, even though the doors had remained closed for months to the #Investigation team. One of the invited journalists confided that the trip was all paid for by the multinational.\r  \n\r  \nThe communication campaign is well orchestrated. Solvay wants to show itself in its best light, that of a transparent and responsible company that takes the lead. This would be to forget that for 15 years it has used and continues to use a replacement PFAS with evidence of its toxicity.\r  \n\r  \nThe Belgian group finally communicated to us in a final email received on 24 August its intention to stop using ADV by the end of 2022.\r  \n\r  \nIn a forthcoming article, with the help of independent scientific experts, we will discover that the neighbours of Solvay's factories are already significantly contaminated by the PFAS used by the Belgian group.\r  \n\r  \n**The investigation \"Solvay, la pollution invisible\" can be seen this Wednesday 7 September at 20:20 in the programme #Investigation on La Une RTBF.**", "created_utc": "1662538599.0", "edited": "False", "id": "infbj77", "is_submitter": "True", "link_id": "t3_x7z6ct", "parent_id": "t1_infbdud", "score": "8", "subreddit": "belgium", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhe6"}, {"author": "Leiegast", "body": "**Another factory, same story**\r  \n\r  \nIn New Jersey flows the Delaware River, a river that crosses four states.

They found the highest level of NFP (976 ppt) (page 415) ever measured in the world a few kilometres downstream from the Solvay plant.\r  \n\r  \nThe noose is tightening around Solvay because all the creeks near the plant are also contaminated (Woodbury creeck, Mantua and Little Mantua creeck, Main Ditch...). In September 2013, the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection required Solvay to test its discharges into the Delaware River. Some concentrations explode the counters (up to 14,000 ppt). In March 2014, groundwater sampling at the plant was even worse. It goes up to 482,000 ppt.\r  \n\r  \n**Contaminated drinking water**\r  \n\r  \nThe pollution is so bad that the NFP is also contaminating the public water system (150 ppt) of the neighbouring town of Paulsboro. In 2014, PFNA was not yet regulated in drinking water. But at that time, it was more than 11 times above the current state standard (13 ppt = 0.013 \u00b5g/l) .\r  \n\r  \nEven today, the drinking water in some districts around the plant is still contaminated. This document from the Borough of National Park shows this. In 2021, the average concentration of PFNA was 0.208 \u00b5g/l. This is 1.6 times above the legal limit even though Solvay stopped using it in 2010.\r  \n\r\r\r  \nJim Stewart has lived near the Solvay plant for 30 years. He has five children and seven grandchildren. \"They have mental problems. Who can say what effect it has? We drink. We eat. You never know what's in it. We shouldn't be living like this. One of her daughters lives in the same house. She has just had a baby. We decide to test the drinking water in the house and send it to an accredited laboratory in Belgium. The findings were the same. The concentration of PFNA still exceeds the legal limit (0.016 \u00b5g/l) despite the filter installed by the family.\r  \n\r  \nIt is clear that stopping the use of a PFAS does not solve the problem. PFAS do not degrade and remain in the environment for hundreds of years.\r  \n\r  \nIn this case, Solvay will deny its responsibility for the pollution. The New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection will sue the Belgian company. It has published its complaint on the web. A damning document for the multinational: \"Despite extensive evidence linking the site to widespread PFAS contamination, Solvay has refused to assume full responsibility for the necessary investigation and remediation. Instead, Solvay has repeatedly sought to blame other actors \\[...\\] even though it has been the main user of PFAS in the area for decades. \\[...\\] Solvay has committed acts and omissions regarding its use and release of PFAS \\[...\\] with actual malice and/or with deliberate disregard for people.\"\r  \n\r  \n**Solvay knew about the toxicity for 15 years**\n\nBut the story does not end there. For Solvay continued to cultivate secrecy. Even before it stopped using NFP or PFOA, it introduced a replacement PFAS into its production: ADV. This was also discovered at the Spinetta rejection point. Evidence of this can be found in a chemical inventory (page 7) of the West Deptford plant. It also has the scientific name ClPFPECA. This PFAS would be as toxic and persistent as the old ones. Solvay knew this and continued to use it anyway.\r  \n\r  \nSolvay has been studying this new molecule for a very long time. Thanks to the American investigative journalist Ryan Felton, we were able to get our hands on internal Solvay documents. The Consumer Reports journalist managed to have them declassified by the EPA, the federal environmental protection agency.\r  \n\r  \nAlready at the end of the 1990s, limited studies suggested the toxicity of VDA. But in 2006, Solvay decided to test VDA on a larger scale on laboratory rats. The conclusions of the study are edifying: \"The results in the liver, observed at all doses, were a clear indication of a toxic effect of the tested element on this organ.\r  \n\r\r\r  \nThe multinational will wait until 2011 before reporting this information to the EPA. \"They've been using it for a very long time. For most of the last 15 years, Solvay knew about these studies. And they didn't make them public until these documents were published by myself and other journalists who were interested in the case. So it shows that if you don't regulate PFAS in a meaningful way, a company can just put a new PFAS in place of an old one. Nobody knows. But every time a new PFAS is used, it seems that it still poses health risks,\" says the American journalist behind the revelations.\r  \n\r  \n**Toxic PFAS in workers' blood**\n\n\r  \nIn 2019, Solvay will provide the EPA with a document that proves that VDA has been entering the blood of its workers in two different plants for more than 10 years. The multinational stopped using it in July 2021 at its West Deptford facility. However, ADV is still used by Solvay in Italy at Spinetta Marengo.\r  \n\r  \nOn 20 October 2021, the Department of Environmental Protection published an important report on VDA (also called ClPFPECAs). This document (page 8) shows that VDA accumulates in the same way in humans.\r  \n\r  \n\"They are reported to be bioaccumulative in humans with a half-life of 2.5 to 3 years, similar to other bioaccumulative PFASs such as perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA). It is even more toxic than PFOA in animals: \"The oral lethal dose (LD50s) for rats reported for ClPFPECAs is lower than for PFOA, indicating that ClPFPECAs are more acutely toxic to rats\".\r  \n\r  \nVDA has already widely contaminated many environmental matrices around the West Deptford plant. EPA and Department of Environmental Protection scientists have found it in soil and water samples. Some of these studies have already been published in the prestigious journal Science.\r  \n\r  \nThe same is true in Italy, where scientist Sara Valsecchi's conclusions are along the same lines: \"Among the PFASs quantified, the components of the ADV mixture were by far the predominant PFASs accumulated in both the aquatic and terrestrial food chain, with levels similar to or even higher than those of PFOA (previously used for many years) \\[...\\] The analysis of the samples collected revealed a high contamination of the area surrounding the plant with fluorinated products, raising concerns for the environment.\r  \n\r  \nWe have sent our investigation to Solvay. The communication department will write back to us: \"We still use a very small residual amount of VDA, which will be further reduced by 90% by the end of 2022, and as you know we are closely monitoring the health parameters of our employees \\[...\\] Solvay has announced an additional investment of EUR 40 million in new technologies to improve its water treatment systems and ensure the removal of perfluorinateds to a level known as \"technical zero\" (close to 100%). The new reverse osmosis plant will be commissioned in late summer and an activated carbon plant will be built in early 2023. The multinational talks about a residual quantity, whereas the Italian scientist refers to a majority component, supported by an analysis report.", "created_utc": "1662538470.0", "edited": "False", "id": "infbdud", "is_submitter": "True", "link_id": "t3_x7z6ct", "parent_id": "t1_infb8kf", "score": "8", "subreddit": "belgium", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhe6"}, {"author": "Leiegast", "body": "**A sick population**\r  \n\r  \nHowever, despite the clean-up carried out by Solvay, the plant's neighbours continue to fall ill in unexplained ways. Alice Lenaz is from Spinetta Marengo. She has seen several of her relatives affected. Her father died of kidney cancer in 2015. Her aunt contracted acute myeloid leukaemia. We meet her a few weeks after the funeral of her uncle, who also passed away due to two brain tumours: 'We were doing the cancer tour at the hospital. First I go to see Dad, then while I'm there I go to see my aunt and our family friend who has something in his stomach. Everyone has cancer in this family. Cancer has become the rhythm. It's the wrong beat to dance to.\"\r  \n\r  \nAt the end of 2019, an epidemiological study published by ARPA, the regional environmental protection agency, will confirm how people feel. It analysed the people living within a radius of 3 km of the Solvay factory. It listed all the pathologies by collecting data on hospital admissions between 2001 and 2017. It then compared this population with that of the neighbouring town of Alessandria, located more than 3 km away. The results are revealing. In Spinetta, residents face an increased risk of developing a liver tumour (30%), kidney cancer (76%), hypertension (8%), respiratory diseases (47%) And that's not all.\r  \n\r\r  \n\r  \n\"What we found was an increase in neurological diseases, especially in children living in the area closest to the plant. There is also an increase in cardiovascular disease. This is very important, very significant, because we know that endocrine disruptors, and in particular PFASs, have the ability to disrupt the body and to increase cholesterol. All these increases that I mention are statistically significant values\", comments Christina Ivaldi, the epidemiologist of the Regional Environmental Protection Agency (ARPA).\r  \n\r  \nThis study does not yet demonstrate a causal link between Solvay's chemicals and diseases. To establish a link, the population would have to be tested with blood samples. Nevertheless, the ARPA epidemiologist has put the word out: PFAS, the famous \"eternal chemicals\", could play a role.\r  \n\r  \nThey are part of the manufacturing process for Solvay's special polymers. They are the golden goose of the Belgian group. They account for the largest share of its turnover (EUR 2.173 billion in 2021). Thanks to the almost indestructible properties of PFAS, Solvay is developing special polymers capable, for example, of making aircraft or cars lighter.\r  \n\r  \nDespite our many requests over the past months, we will never have the opportunity to visit this plant or even to interview a manager directly. Solvay will only communicate with us in writing.\r  \n\r  \nOn 17 May, the communications department made it clear that PFAS are used in a very strict manner: \"\\[...\\] at Spinetta, we apply state-of-the-art technologies that enable us to eliminate almost 100% of fluorinated surfactant emissions. We use fluorosurfactants in the production of certain polymers that require very specific characteristics in terms of resistance. They are produced in a closed and strictly controlled cycle to avoid emissions to water and air.\" The message that Solvay wants to get across is clear: the multinational is constantly investing in the tightness of its facilities.\r  \n\r  \nIn Spinetta, Solvay used PFOA until 2013. PFOA is considered to be one of the most toxic PFAS. Dr Corinne Charlier, Head of the Clinical Toxicology Department at the University Hospital of Li\u00e8ge, is well aware of its impact on health: \"Among the effects that we know for sure, we know that there is an effect on the thyroid function. We know that there is an increase in cholesterol. There is a decrease in the proper functioning of the liver. We have seen kidney cancers and testicular cancers. And during pregnancy, this is obviously always the most problematic time of exposure for the foetus. For the child, there are developmental problems. The baby will be born with a lower birth weight when the mother is exposed. And we also have a poorer response to vaccination.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**PFAS in air and water**\r  \n\r  \nHowever, the watertightness put forward by Solvay is just a piece of talk. Despite the abandonment of PFOA, Solvay is still releasing it into the air and water today. Scientific reports confirm this.\r  \n\r  \nIn February 2020, the IRSA, the water research institute, will be taking samples at Solvay's industrial wastewater discharge point. This is where the plant's liquid effluent is discharged into the Bormida River, one kilometre east of the plant. Significant concentrations of PFOA (2938 \u00b5g/l) can be seen there.\r  \n\r  \nIn March 2020, an air monitoring campaign conducted by ARPA shows that PFOA is also found (page 29) in the atmospheric fallout from the plant.\r  \n\r  \nOn 17 March 2022, we will meet an independent scientist who is documenting Solvay's release of perfluorinated compounds into the environment. Sara Valsecchi works for the National Research Centre (CNR) and the Institute for Water Research (IRSA). She takes us to the plant's discharge point for further sampling. Again, PFOA is still present in her sample (0.1902 \u00b5g/l).\r  \n\r  \nIn fact, this concentration will only be considered illegal in 2024. A new law that came out in October 2021 only regulates the discharge of PFAS into surface waters. It leaves a tolerance zone of 3 years for the company. After this period, such a concentration will be almost twice as high as the threshold set by the Piedmont region (0.10 \u00b5g/l). The February 2020 sample (2.938 \u00b5g/l) was 29 times above this threshold.\r  \n\r  \nBut PFOA is only the tip of the iceberg. Sara Valsecchi will show us that the company uses other PFAS. Very little known substitutes to replace the older ones that have become controversial. \"The substance with the highest concentration is this VDA mixture. 67% of all PFAS is this VDA mixture. Then, almost half a microgram of C6O4 was also found.\r  \n\r  \nNew names unknown to the public. Let's look at ADV, the main compound found at the factory. It has been used for a long time by Solvay. Even before PFOA was removed from its manufacturing process. Let's change the scene to understand the importance of this discovery for our investigation. Because the multinational has also used this molecule in another country: the United States.", "created_utc": "1662538350.0", "edited": "False", "id": "infb8kf", "is_submitter": "True", "link_id": "t3_x7z6ct", "parent_id": "t1_infaj7i", "score": "10", "subreddit": "belgium", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhe6"}, {"author": "Leiegast", "body": "**An investigation conducted by the #Investigation team with the support of the Journalism Fund reveals that some Solvay factories have contaminated neighbouring populations with toxic substances described as \"eternal chemicals\". This pollution affected two countries: Italy and the United States. Internal documents from the chemical giant show that the Belgian company replaced certain controversial chemicals with others that were just as toxic. The multinational knew this and has continued to use them for more than 15 years.**\n\nIt seems as if history is stuttering. After the Dupont factory scandal in the United States and, closer to home, the 3M company in the Antwerp region, it is now the turn of Solvay, one of Belgium's leading industrial companies, to be implicated in a major pollution of perfluorinated compounds, better known as PFAS.\n\nPFASs (per- and polyfluroalkyl substances) are molecules that are so stable that they have been nicknamed \"eternal chemicals\". These perfluorinated compounds were invented by man. They are resistant to very high temperatures. They can repel water, grease, etc. They are used in a whole range of applications: non-stick coatings for frying pans (Teflon) or waterproof clothing.\n\nIn our lives, they are everywhere: our packaging, our cosmetics, our cars, our planes, our fire-fighting foams, etc. They accumulate in living beings and are extremely persistent. They accumulate in living organisms and are extremely persistent, lasting up to several hundred years in the environment. PFAS are a large family of almost 5000 substances. Some are endocrine disruptors and suspected carcinogens. The two best known are PFOS and PFOA.\n\n**The origin of the investigation**\n\nThe starting point of this investigation is the scandal at the 3M factory in Zwijndrecht. In the spring of 2021, Belgium discovered widespread PFOS contamination. At the time, we were trying to find out whether 3M was one of the biggest emitters of perfluorinated compounds in Europe.\n\nOne document contains the answer: the European Pollutant Release Register (E-PRTR). It lists the releases of more than 30,000 companies on the European continent. In the many lines of pollutants, we find a first clue: perfluorocarbons (PFCS). These are not PFOS or PFOA directly. Rather, these greenhouse gases are an indication of a significant use of perfluorinated compounds at an industrial site.\n\nNot surprisingly, 3M often appears in the European TOP 5 or even on the European podium. But from 2007 to 2015, there is one plant that outperforms all others. It emits 6 to 7 times more perfluorinated gases into the air than 3M in Zwijndrecht. About 200 tonnes per year. It is owned by Solvay and is located in Spinetta Marengo, Italy, an hour's drive from Milan. The data from the register can be found here.\n\nA few clicks on the web allow us to quickly understand that this plant is targeted in the Italian media for environmental problems. We decided to go there to document this potential pollution.\n\n**A poison in the taps**\n\nTo fully understand the issues at stake, we first have to look back in time. Solvay arrived at Spinetta Marengo in 2002. Twenty years ago it bought Ausimont, the plant's former name. It wanted to expand its portfolio of specialty polymers. These ultra-light and resistant compounds are used in the automobile, aeronautics, battery and electronics industries. It therefore swallowed up Ausimont, a specialist in fluropolymers, for 1.3 billion euros. At the time, it was Solvay's biggest acquisition.\n\nThis plant is a century old. Before polymers, chromium and acids were produced here. A poison close to the village and its inhabitants. 6 years after the purchase, the first problems came with the water. Solvay distributes free water to the nearest inhabitants.\n\nJust behind the factory wall, Maurizzio Spinolo, a local resident, shows us a tap on his land: \"This is the water for watering our vegetable garden, everyone's vegetable garden here. Until 2008 when they discovered hexavalent chromium in the groundwater and in the whole area.\"\n\nIn reality, 800,000 m\u00b3 of toxic substances were buried in the basement of the plant. Poisons buried before Solvay arrived by former managers. The upper part of the aquifer under the plant is completely compromised. Some concentrations of hexavalent chromium (8203 ug/L) in the groundwater were sometimes more than 1600 times above Italian standards. Traces of this known carcinogen will eventually reach our taps. \"We have all drunk this external water from Solvay. And if a child plays outside, what does he do? They drink it. It's clear that something is going to happen to me,\" says Maurizzio. The water will be cut off permanently in 2008.\n\n**A mega environmental lawsuit**\n\nEven though Solvay was not the cause of the pollution, it will be sued in the same way as the former owners. The case began in 2008. Ninety people have filed civil suits against Solvay and the trial will last 11 years. It even went all the way to the Supreme Court of Cassation. In the end, Solvay and three of its directors were convicted.\n\n\"The defendants had committed an environmental disaster, a culpable disaster without a name, aggravating a historical contamination because they were accused of not having maintained some 50 kilometres of water pipes and in this water flowed poisons deposited in the soil by other managers, not by Solvay. They knew what they were buying and, by not maintaining the water network, they continued to allow the disastrous contamination of the water table to continue\", explains Vittorio Spallasso, lawyer for the civil parties.\n\nThe Court of Cassation's ruling points to the negligence of several Solvay managers, including the environmental manager: \"\\[...\\] Carimati was clearly fully aware of the serious contamination of the site and the surrounding area and had failed to propose or carry out the necessary investigation and to take the appropriate measures to contain or reduce the pollution.The judgement goes even further, stating that Solvay deliberately withheld information from the public authorities: \"there was a clear intention on the part of the two companies that succeeded each other on the site (Ausimont and Solvay) to conceal or omit data relating to the pollution, in order to make the situation of the internal and external water table appear better than it actually was.\n\nThe lawyer for the civil parties speaks of a blatant lack of transparency: \"There was a double accounting of the poisons. There were the correct analyses with the real values of the toxic substances and analyses where the concentrations were lower, watered down. Solvay used the latter. We will see later that the omission of important data from public authorities is a pattern that will be repeated in other parts of the world. The company will eventually be ordered to pay over \u20ac420,000 in damages to the civil parties.\n\n**Public justice vs. private justice**\n\nThis is a final judgement by the state courts. However, Solvay is challenging this judicial truth and is going to take another parallel route: an arbitration before the International Chamber of Commerce. A sort of \"private\" justice organized by an institution that represents companies worldwide.The multinational won the case. The Court of Arbitration considers that the former owner of Ausimont (Edison) had deceived Solvay at the time of the acquisition of the Spinetta plant. Solvay is to be paid more than 90 million euros in compensation. Private justice is in total contradiction with the judgements handed down by the state justice.\n\nSolvay only retains this part of the story: \"The arbitration award recognizes that Edison (the former owner of Ausimont) deliberately made false statements to Solvay during the acquisition. Although not responsible for past pollution, Solvay took significant remedial action over many years \\[...\\] Solvay invested more than \u20ac280 million in remediating the site's historical pollution, improving its safety and environmental footprint, and upgrading it.\n\nMove along.

It is not because of what it says, but because of where it is published: it appears in chapter 7 of the new French textbook \"Tangram\", which is the basis for the work of secondary school pupils in the French Community (FWB), and is spread over almost four pages, on pages 192, 193, 194 and 195 as part of an exercise. The textbook is used extensively by students in secondary 2 and 3.**\r  \n\r  \nWhen we leafed through it, the manual in question did not contain any other interview with a political representative, which raises questions about the neutrality of a supposedly apolitical textbook.\r  \n\r  \nAnother questionable point is that the interview in question was conducted by two of the authors of the textbook, Isabelle Denayer and Isabelle Koziel. It is therefore not an interview conducted by a traditional media and included in the syllabus as an example, but an interview specifically conducted for the occasion.\r  \n\r  \nRajae Maouane invites the students to contact her, to share a coffee or to \"evolve together\". This is followed by a review of her political battles (feminism, discrimination, etc.), her role models, her priorities and even her love for certain artists or sportsmen.\r  \n\r  \n**An investigation opened by the minister Caroline D\u00e9sir**\r  \nContacted by our colleagues at LN24, where Martin Buxant devoted his editorial to the subject on Wednesday, the publisher of the manual, Plantyn, did not wish to communicate at this stage.\r  \n\r  \nFor her part, the PS Minister for Education Caroline D\u00e9sir has opened an investigation, we learn. \"Based on the information we have at this stage, the situation clearly warrants a thorough investigation. The Minister has therefore immediately instructed her administration to analyse the textbook in order to verify its compatibility with the charter to which publishers are subject and with the principles of the law on the school pact, which prohibits all political propaganda in schools. If this investigation reveals that the legislation is not being respected, a procedure to withdraw the textbook's approval will be initiated.\r  \n\r  \n**Jeholet: \"No place in schools\"**\r  \nThe minister-president of the French Community also reacted, saying that a publisher \"who spreads political propaganda in school textbooks has no place in schools\". He added: \"And to have accepted this interview is at best clumsiness, at worst a mistake.\r  \n\r  \n**Rajae Maouane: \"An honour for me\"**\r  \nOn the social network Twitter, the co-president of Ecolo (and local councillor in Molenbeek) reacted to the growing controversy. She detailed her approach: \"I received a request for an interview on my background, my interests and my political priorities. Of course, I responded positively. I knew that this request was part of a project to write a school textbook in which there would be a sequence entitled \"Be Belgian once\" (Sois Belge une fois). However, I knew nothing about the other personalities interviewed. It is an honour for me to be interviewed in this context, as other politicians have been before me,\" she says, on her own initiative.\r  \n\r  \nOn the other hand, she distances herself from the final treatment of her interview: \"I am of course not responsible for the editorial choices of the editors and publishers, whose editorial freedom I respect 1000%. On the other hand, well beyond the question of my party, it is important for me to show young people that politics can also be the domain of young people, but also of women.

This is the conclusion of a study published today by the Federal Planning Bureau and the Brussels Institute for Statistics and Analysis (BISA/IBSA). Especially women, according to the study, would find work faster if they spoke better Dutch.**\r  \n\r  \nOfficially, Brussels is a bilingual region, but for many Brussels residents their knowledge of Dutch or French is rather limited. As a result, many job-seekers miss out on opportunities on the labour market, argue the Federal Planning Bureau and BISA in a new study. To this end, they examined the files of all French-speaking Belgians in Brussels who are registered with Actiris, the Brussels counterpart of the VDAB.\r  \n\r  \nAlmost 30 percent of the jobseekers indicate that they speak Dutch on an A1 level, which is the absolute basic knowledge. Another 37 percent have a level of A2 - meaning they only understand simple texts with very easy words.\r  \n\r  \nAltogether, 67 percent of the surveyed group does not speak Dutch at a level that is functional for the labour market. Even among people with a higher education diploma, 45 percent do not go beyond this level. Less than one in five jobseekers speaks at least an advanced level of Dutch.\r  \n\r  \nThis limited knowledge of Dutch is a disadvantage for the French-speaking inhabitants of Brussels when looking for a job. The same study shows, for example, that people with at least an advanced level of Dutch have a 20 percent better chance of finding a job than people who do not go beyond level A2. Figures from Actiris itself, which already date from 2019, also show that half of the vacancies explicitly ask for knowledge of Dutch and French.\r  \n\r  \nThose who speak good Dutch therefore stand a significantly better chance of finding work, the study concludes - regardless of their level of study. This rule appears to apply especially to women. This may have something to do with the sectors in which they are looking for work. For example, Dutch has a greater advantage in sales than in some other sectors.\r  \n\r  \nThe Federal Planning Bureau and BISA also point out that French-speaking jobseekers who barely speak Dutch not only miss out more often in Brussels. It is also difficult for them to find work in Flanders, even if it is nearby. And this despite the fact that Brussels and Flanders have set up a cooperation agreement to attract more Brussels job seekers to jobs in Flanders.\r  \n\r  \nTranslated with www.DeepL.com/Translator (free version)", "created_utc": "1661255514.0", "edited": "1661263425.0", "id": "ilg05x9", "is_submitter": "True", "link_id": "t3_wvmrhg", "parent_id": "t3_wvmrhg", "score": "14", "subreddit": "belgium", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhe6"}, {"author": "Leiegast", "body": ">And yet it's the greatest ~~city~~ *drug den* on earth\ud83d\ude08\n\nFTFY", "created_utc": "1661250601.0", "edited": "1661254788.0", "id": "ilfsir2", "is_submitter": "True", "link_id": "t3_wvidy1", "parent_id": "t1_ilfjdlf", "score": "8", "subreddit": "belgium", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhe6"}, {"author": "Leiegast", "body": "I wouldn't say it never happens, but where I'm from (Kortrijk area), we don't really use ons/onze in front of names and certainly not to the extent that Brabantians use it. \n\nSo you can say things like \"oezn oend e zieke\" (our dog is ill), but saying \"Oeze Basiel e zieke\" (Our Basiel is sick) would sound off.

Finally, Brussels is stepping into the 21st century.\r  \n\r  \nIt was a great spectacle again last week. The City of Brussels, governed by a progressive political majority, introduces a circulation plan and immediately the liberal opposition is on the barricades. My car, my freedom, right? Predictable, the reaction of the French-speaking Liberals, but not really credible. Opposition party Les Engag\u00e9s, for example, was much more moderate in its criticism. Also noteworthy: the traditional loudmouths railing against restricting car traffic were conspicuous by their absence.\r  \n\r  \nThis is certainly due to the holiday period, but also to the clever communication of Groen alderman Bart Dhondt. On the one hand, the City of Brussels is sticking to the plan, but on the other hand, it does not rule out adjustments. This immediately stifles any criticism.\r  \n\r  \nMore fundamentally, some of the MR's arguments fail to make sense. The Pentagon (Vijfhoek) remains one hundred percent accessible by car, with the thousands of underground parking spaces that the city centre has had for a long time. They are within walking distance of just about every busy spot in the city.\r  \n\r  \nToday, the inner ring road is the most accessible place in the country, with the largest train stations, the busiest metro lines, and trams and buses that run deep into Brussels' neighbourhoods.\r  \n\r  \nAnd then there is good practice. Numerous cities, such as Ghent, but also French cities, have preceded Brussels. And there are no known examples of cities that were worse off after the introduction of a circulation plan. On the contrary.\r  \n\r  \nBrussels itself can also serve as an example: the pedestrian zone in the city centre proves that fewer cars means more quality of life. Conversely, as every traffic expert knows, more car means less mobility.\r  \n\r  \nOne last thing to unlearn? Yes, some drivers will have to take a different route to reach their destination or make a detour. With a GPS or apps like Waze, this is no longer a problem. So what are we squawking about? With the circulation plan, in this or any other form, Brussels is finally taking a real step into the 21st century, and doing what it should have done when it introduced the pedestrian zone.\r  \n\r  \n**Crucial months**\r  \nDoes that mean all mobility problems are over? Certainly not. Car traffic itself will not disappear. The car remains an important means of transport in the region and there is nothing wrong with that.\r  \n\r  \nMonitoring will therefore be necessary. And that is what is happening. Mobiris, the Brussels Region's traffic centre, is on top of things. What has it observed today? One, the chaos of the first day of the introduction has disappeared pretty quickly. And two, the Dansaert neighbourhood is getting quite a lot of traffic. In the long run, this could cause a problem at the Vlaamsepoort, where the car traffic is directed out of the city. At the same time, the busy car traffic seems to be blocked mainly by ... the busy pedestrian traffic. This will not be easy to solve. So we have to wait and see.\r  \n\r  \nNevertheless, September and October will be the crucial months for further monitoring traffic flows. Traffic to and from school will start up again, the holidays are over for most people. Telecommuting makes commuting more flexible. There are the expensive fuel prices, and since two years the corona cycle paths. In any case, traffic behaviour is difficult to predict.\r  \n\r  \nTraffic experts do believe that the introduction of the circulation plan will eventually lead to a new balance on the major axes - read: the traffic will run more or less smoothly again - with the caveat that some of the car traffic will inevitably evaporate.\r  \n\r  \nFor that will ultimately be one of the major side-effects of the Good Move plans throughout the region. They are there to keep cut-through traffic out of residential areas, but the larger axes around those areas may not be able to swallow it all. Drivers will turn to alternatives.\r  \n\r  \nBut what then? Good Move, like the previous mobility plans, aims to reduce car traffic in and to the city, and thus to have a city with fewer traffic jams and a better quality of life. That is exactly what any city should do to become more attractive.\r  \n\r  \nTranslated with www.DeepL.com/Translator (free version)", "created_utc": "1661240404.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ilfg0s3", "is_submitter": "True", "link_id": "t3_wvidy1", "parent_id": "t3_wvidy1", "score": "19", "subreddit": "belgium", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhe6"}, {"author": "Leiegast", "body": "So Norwegian is like English then, where you have phrasal verbs like 'give up', 'lay off', 'do in' or compound verbs like 'outgrow', 'proofread', 'overstay', but they have a fixed structure?", "created_utc": "1661186819.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ilcb6vb", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_wusdf0", "parent_id": "t1_ilbzo91", "score": "9", "subreddit": "AskEurope", "subreddit_id": "t5_2uayg"}, {"author": "Leiegast", "body": "It's only used in the Brabant area of the country AFAIK, so in around cities like Brussels and Antwerp.

This is according to a new study by an international team of scientists. The battle of 1815 was the final defeat of the French emperor Napoleon Bonaparte.**\n\nOn 18 June 1815 the deposed French emperor Napoleon Bonaparte finally bit the dust in Waterloo in what is now Walloon Brabant. His forces are defeated by a British coalition army under command of the Duke of Wellington and by a Prussian force under command of General von Bl\u00fccher.\n\nSeveral tens of thousands were killed, but what happened to all those who died? It is one of the greatest mysteries surrounding the famous battle, because excavations at the historic site have so far revealed scarcely any human remains. An international team of historians has dug into the archives and suspects that they have cracked the riddle.\n\nIn the years after the battle, they say, the bodies were exhumed by the local population and sold to the sugar industry. In order to purify sugar beets, bone char is - at that time - needed. Bone charcoal is made from charred animal bones.\n\nAccording to the researchers, in the decades following the battle, not only animal bones, but also the skeletons of fallen soldiers ended up in the sugar. Some sugar with coffee or a pastry could therefore have contained human remains at that time.\n\nFarming - especially in those days - does not make you rich. Local farmers could earn a multiple of what they could otherwise scrape together in their entire lives by selling a few cartloads of bones. Especially after a law was passed in the early 1830s that made it financially very interesting to trade in (animal) bones. \n\nFrom 1834 onwards, evidence of \"incidents\" on the site of the famous battle can be found in all kinds of archives. \"There is a report from a German geologist who reports seeing peasants digging up bones on the field in Waterloo,\" says historian Bernard Wilkin, who helped do the research, to RTBF. \"They are presumably horse bones, but someone jokes at the same time that the bones of the imperial guard could easily be mistaken for horse bones.\"\n\n**Public secret for a long time**\nIt is an open secret at the time that human bones end up in sugar. A German newspaper even recommends using honey in coffee \"to avoid drinking your great-grandparent's atoms in the morning, which - as we all know - is quite possible with sugar\". \n\nAccording to the RTBF, the excavations in Waterloo are even the subject of parliamentary questions calling on the local authorities to intervene.\n\nThese include correspondence from the then mayor of Braine-l'Alleud to the local commander of the gendarmerie to intervene. \"The higher authorities are asking me to stop this on the basis of article 360 of the penal code,\" it says. That article punishes excavations. According to Wilkin, no evidence has been found that anyone has actually been arrested for these illegal excavations.\n\nNot all bones of the dead were used to make sugar. Earlier research has shown that at least some of the bodies were ground into bone meal to fertilise fields.\n\nThe sugar factory of Tienen has announced on social media that they do not use bones in their sugar.", "created_utc": "1661066355.0", "edited": "False", "id": "il60s0s", "is_submitter": "True", "link_id": "t3_wttc6s", "parent_id": "t3_wttc6s", "score": "419", "subreddit": "europe", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh4j"}, {"author": "Leiegast", "body": "Verkoopt die nu ook al bier?

Schr\u00f6der demands that a former chancellor's office with staff be made available to him again.**\r  \n\r  \nFormer Chancellor Gerhard Schr\u00f6der (SPD) is suing the Bundestag for restoration of the special rights he was deprived of in May. The 78-year-old demands that a former chancellor's office with staff be made available to him again, as his Hanover lawyer Michael Nagel told the Deutsche Presse-Agentur on Friday.\r  \n\r  \nThe complaint had been filed with the Berlin Administrative Court, Nagel said. The decision of the Bundestag budget committee to cut off Schr\u00f6der's funds for equipping his office in the Bundestag and to put the office on hold was illegal, according to a statement by the law firm obtained by dpa. It is \"claimed that former Federal Chancellor Gerhard Schr\u00f6der is no longer performing his so-called 'post-effective official duties'\". However, \"it is not specified what \"retroactive official duties\" actually are, how their fulfilment or non-fulfilment is to be determined and what procedure is to be followed in this regard\", the statement continues.\r  \n\r  \n**Reminiscences \"of an absolutist princely state**\r  \nIt is \"written all over the case that other reasons than those given by the 'new rules' were decisive for the decision of the budget committee\". Such decisions are \"rather reminiscent of an absolutist princely state in terms of the way they were made\" and should not be allowed to stand in a democratic constitutional state, Schr\u00f6der's lawyers explained.\r  \n\r  \nThe former chancellor has come under massive criticism because of his involvement with Russian energy companies and his closeness to Russian President Vladimir Putin. However, the budget committee had explicitly not justified the partial cancellation of Schr\u00f6der's privileges with his work for the energy companies or his stance on the Russian war of aggression against Ukraine. Rather, the \"endowment of former chancellors should be made according to the continuing obligations of office\", according to the regulation. Apparently, the parliamentarians could not recognise these in Schr\u00f6der's case. Last year, more than 400,000 euros were paid out of the state coffers for personnel expenses in Schr\u00f6der's office. After the decision, Schr\u00f6der will continue to receive his pension of 8300 euros as well as personal protection.\r  \n\r  \nChancellor Olaf Scholz (SPD) had welcomed the decision in May as \"logical\". In the run-up to the decision, the European Parliament had voted by a large majority in favour of sanctions against Schr\u00f6der. Only on Monday, the SPD's arbitration committee in Schr\u00f6der's home town of Hanover had rejected a party expulsion of the former chancellor.\r  \n\r  \nSchr\u00f6der's Hanover lawyer is considered one of the most renowned criminal lawyers in Germany. Among others, he also represented the former Federal President Christian Wulff.\n\n\r\r  \n**The statement of Schr\u00f6der's lawyers in the wording**\r  \n\"On the recommendation of the Budget Committee, the German Bundestag decided in May 2022 to cancel the funds for the furnishing of his office in the German Bundestag for Chancellor (ret.) Gerhard Schr\u00f6der and to put the office on hold. This decision is unlawful. We have therefore filed a complaint with the Berlin Administrative Court. We make only this one statement in the hope that, also in the interest of the defendants, the legal issues raised will only be discussed in court and not through the media.\r  \n\r  \nThe responsible persons determined new rules to legitimise the now contested decision. To clarify the underlying facts in advance, at least according to their own new standards, on the other hand, was not worth the effort. Instead, it is claimed that former Federal Chancellor Gerhard Schr\u00f6der is no longer performing his so-called \"retroactive official duties\". However, it is not specified what \"retroactive official duties\" actually are, how their fulfilment or non-fulfilment is to be determined and what procedure is to be followed in this respect. It is written all over the process that other reasons than those given by the \"new rules\" were decisive for the decision of the budget committee.\n\n\r  \nSuch decisions, which are rather reminiscent of an absolutist princely state in terms of the way they were made, cannot be allowed to stand in a democratic constitutional state. The decision is arbitrary. Its mere acceptance and unchecked acceptance cannot be considered. Former Federal Chancellor Gerhard Schr\u00f6der was neither given the opportunity to comment on the decision nor was he otherwise given a legal hearing. The proceedings must finally be conducted according to the principles of the rule of law and, if necessary, decided on the merits by the court. Communication via the media, which has characterised the proceedings so far, should therefore not take place any further until the Administrative Court has ruled on the matter.\"  \nTranslated with www.DeepL.com/Translator (free version)", "created_utc": "1660297634.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ijz3vix", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_wmh6bi", "parent_id": "t3_wmh6bi", "score": "1", "subreddit": "europe", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh4j"}, {"author": "Leiegast", "body": "I'm like 99% convinced that those types of people are physically incapable of crossing the canal, save for going to IKEA probably", "created_utc": "1660296772.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ijz2sih", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_wmg865", "parent_id": "t1_ijz1i80", "score": "26", "subreddit": "brussels", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s5xy"}, {"author": "Leiegast", "body": "Tervuren is Brussels now I guess...\n\nI also like how the northwest was completely ignored.

The decree also reinstated a number of disputed priority rules for Dutch speakers. The priority for Dutch speakers was raised from 55 to 65%. In addition, a new priority group of 15 per cent was introduced in secondary education for pupils who had previously attended Dutch-speaking primary education for nine years.\r  \n\r  \nThe Constitutional Court sees no objection to 65 per cent of the places in Dutch-speaking schools in Brussels being reserved for Dutch-speakers because it meets a reasonable need. Moreover, it does not prevent the Flemish community from taking up a fair share of pupils whose home language is neither Dutch nor French. The Court does annul the rule that pupils who have already had nine years of schooling in Dutch-speaking primary education also receive a priority of 15 per cent of places in secondary education.\r  \n\r  \n**Bilingual ketjes**\r  \n\n\nIn a press release, Flemish MP Annabel Tavernier (N-VA) is pleased with the ruling of the Constitutional Court, but criticises Cocof's attitude. \"It is thanks to N-VA that the proportion of priority for Dutch speakers was increased from 55 to 65%. I am of course very pleased that the Constitutional Court has decided that this increase is constitutional,\" she says.\r  \n\r  \n\"The fact that Cocof wanted to make it impossible for Dutch speakers to find a place in a Flemish school in Brussels defies all imagination. Education in Brussels is a competence of both the French and Flemish Communities. Flanders takes its responsibility and provides bilingual and even trilingual children. The French Community does not. Only 8 percent of French-speaking school-leavers speak a decent word of Dutch. Instead of fighting legal battles, the Cocof would have done better to spend its time on increasing the capacity and quality of its education.\"\r  \n\r  \nFlemish Minister Weyts (N-VA) is satisfied with the ruling. \"The Constitutional Court rejects the French-speaking objections and confirms the principles of the Flemish priority policy in Brussels. The 15 per cent rule in secondary education can easily be remedied. This is good news for the Flemish people in Brussels and proof that a resolute priority policy is indeed possible - both in Brussels and in the Vlaamse Rand.\r  \n\r  \n**Nine-year requirement too long**\r  \n\n\nGroen, however, hopes for a thorough adjustment of the 15% rule. \"The Constitutional Court stated today that requiring a school career of nine years in Dutch-speaking education is too long. We don't think that is fair either,\" argues Flemish Member of Parliament Stijn Bex. \"After all, this means that every child that did not attend Dutch-speaking education from the first year of kindergarten cannot appeal to the priority rule. We therefore propose that all children who have completed the fourth, fifth and sixth years of study in Dutch-speaking primary education can make use of the priority rule and, in so doing, can continue their studies together with their classmates. That is not only fairer: we also believe that the Constitutional Court will have a better chance of approving this proposal.\r  \n\r  \nFlemish parliamentary group leader Hannelore Goeman (Vooruit) is pleased that the Court also judges that the required nine years is too long. \"It was certainly a noble idea to give these pupils priority in enrolment. Those who consciously choose Dutch-language education as a non-native should be rewarded for this,\" she says.\r  \n\r  \n\"But for Vooruit it was clear from the start: nine years is just too long. And now the Constitutional Court agrees with us. As the Court also recognises, this regulation threatens to deny, for example, highly gifted children who get through primary education quicker access to Dutch-language secondary education. Moreover, 15 per cent is a ridiculously small percentage if you know that the vast majority of pupils in the first year in Dutch-speaking secondary education in Brussels come from Dutch-speaking primary education.\"\n\n**Flemish decree**\r  \n\n\nThe priority rules were part of the broader Flemish decree that introduced new enrolment rules in order to put an end to long queues at the gates of popular schools. Specifically for Brussels, Flanders raised the priority for Dutch speakers from 55 to 65 percent. These are pupils with at least one parent with a sufficient command of Dutch.\r  \n\r  \nIn addition, pupils who had already attended school for nine years in Dutch-speaking primary education would also receive a priority of 15 per cent of places in secondary education. This was not to the liking of the French Community Commission in Brussels (Cocof), which protested with a conflict of interest. As a result, the discussion of the enrolment decree was halted and the new enrolment rules could not be launched as planned.\r  \n\r  \nConsultations between the two communities did not lead to a breakthrough, but because the procedure of the conflict of interests was completely finished, the Flemish Parliament could still approve the decree during the last session of the previous legislature.

This is the conclusion of EU Advocate General Richard de la Tour to the questions posed by Supreme Court magistrate Pablo Llarena and which directly affect the case of former Catalan president Carles Puigdemont and the other members of his government who fled with him to Belgium. The response of the Advocate General agrees with the Spanish court, which considered that the interpretation of European law being applied by the Belgian justice system in the decisions that have to do with the pro-independence leaders who have fled to that country disagrees with that made by the Spanish courts and with that contained in the framework decision that regulates the European arrest warrants. \"The Framework Decision does not allow an executing judicial authority to review whether an issuing judicial authority has jurisdiction under the law of the issuing Member State to issue an EAW,\" the Advocate General points out.\n\nThe decision of the Belgian judiciary to refuse the surrender of former minister Llu\u00eds Puig in February 2021 set off alarm bells in the Supreme Court and precipitated the submission of a preliminary ruling. Although the brief was based on Belgium's reasons for not handing over Puig (prosecuted for embezzlement and disobedience), Llarena's ultimate objective was to limit Belgium's possibilities of rejecting the European arrest warrant for sedition and embezzlement issued against Puigdemont and the former ministers Toni Com\u00edn and Clara Ponsat\u00ed (the latter only for sedition). The opinion of the Advocate General is not binding, but it usually coincides with the rulings issued by the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU), which in the coming months will give the definitive answers to the Spanish magistrate's questions.\n\nIn the letter sent to the CJEU, Llarena posed nine questions. Some sought answers on how he should act as the judge issuing the European arrest warrant and others were aimed at specifying the role of the Belgian justice system as the executor of these arrest warrants and its possibilities of rejecting them. One of the reasons given by Belgium in refusing to hand over Puig was that the Supreme Court, in its opinion, did not have jurisdiction to try the former minister, but that it should be the courts of Catalonia that should do so. Llarena disagrees with this argument and asked the European court whether the Belgian justice system \"can question the competence\" of the Supreme Court in this case and reject the surrender on the grounds that it is not competent to issue the European arrest warrant. The response of the Advocate General supports the thesis of the Spanish magistrate. De la Tour argues that no country can control whether the judge who issues a European arrest warrant is competent to try the case. \"To authorise such a check would contravene the principle of procedural autonomy, according to which Member States may designate in their national law the judicial authority competent to issue EAWs, and the principle of mutual recognition, the 'cornerstone' of judicial cooperation in criminal matters, according to which the execution of the EAW is the rule, while refusal of execution is conceived as an exception which must be subject to strict interpretation\", the Advocate General recalls.\n\nBy refusing Puig's surrender, and throughout the process of processing the EAWs, the Belgian judiciary has questioned whether Spain will respect the fundamental rights of the fugitive pro-independence leaders. The Advocate General warns, however, that the execution of an EAW cannot be refused when there is no information available to demonstrate, \"by means of an overall assessment based on objective, reliable, precise and duly updated data\", the existence of a real risk of infringement of the fundamental right to a fair trial before a judge previously established by law, a right guaranteed by the second paragraph of Article 47 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. To do so, Belgium would have to demonstrate \"systemic or generalised deficiencies in the functioning of the judicial system\" in Spain, says De la Tour, who recalls that, where such deficiencies do not exist, the executing judicial authority cannot doubt that the person concerned will be able to obtain a declaration and, if necessary, correct or sanction a possible infringement of that fundamental right by means of appeals in different instances, including the Constitutional Court. Both Puigdemont and the defendants who remained in Spain and who have already been tried and convicted by the Supreme Court have appealed to the Court of Guarantees, which has backed the Supreme Court's thesis in all cases.

Forget classical set-ups with boring information boards and display cabinets full of artefacts: the Belevingsmuseum Kortrijk 1302 is a museum of the future. The city of Kortrijk wants to reach everyone in an accessible way, including those who prefer to visit a classic museum.\n\nThe visit starts in the Counts Chapel, where a multimedia projection has been developed. This not only brings the story of the Battle of the Golden Spurs to life, but also of the run-up to it. Apparently, it all started in the ninth century, when the French king saw his daughter Judith flee to marry nobleman Baudouin.\n\nAccording to the king, this Baudouin was not good enough for his daughter, but for the sake of peace and quiet, he allowed the couple a piece of his territory. Baudouin would become the first count of Flanders. The story, which you hear through headphones, was read by actors Chris Lomme and Dries Vanhegen, whom you may know as Patrick from telenovela Sara and as Kurt and Paul from Thuis en Familie. \n\n**Rudi Vranckx**\n\nAfter the projection, touch screens allow you to experience the story from the point of view of the French king, and from that of the count of Flanders. \"A war is of course always a tale of two sides,\" says Rudi Vandeputte, project manager from the city. \"The truth lies somewhere in the middle. That is why we also had war journalist Rudi Vranckx report objectively on this battle.\"\n\nSome popular ideas are also explained: how it came about that the lion became the symbol of Flanders, for example, and from where that name 'Guldensporenslag' comes. \"Because that is a name that was only given to the battle later.\" And that 'schild en vriend' was used to recognise Frenchmen and to make them a head shorter when pronounced incorrectly is not correct. \"It was actually the battle cry of the Flemings.\n\nThe showpiece is a coffin over 700 years old in which lifelike memories of 1302 have been carved. The chest comes over from Oxford and will be on display in the city for at least a year.\n\n\"It is a historic day today,\" says alderman Axel Ronse. \"As of today, we are playing with Kortrijk in the Champions League of the museum experience.

A mantra that has been on the lips of almost all politicians, especially since the publication of the expert report presented on Tuesday. But for Ecolo group leader Gilles Vanden Burre, not everyone is as motivated and committed to achieving it. Interview.\r  \n\r  \n**What do you think of the report on tax reform?**\r  \n\r  \nWe share most of the findings of the experts. The Belgian system is unfair, complex and not clear enough. Most of our fellow citizens, who make their tax returns, are aware of this complexity. It is also unfair because we can see that taxation on labour is too high, especially for low and medium salaries. This is a real problem. And it is not high enough on other types of income, such as wealth.\r  \n\r  \n**Time for action?**\r  \n\r  \nYes. The time for experts and consultations has passed. The time for reports has passed, now it's time for political action, we want to see an ambitious tax reform. We hear other parties, including within the federal majority, who no longer want or expect an ambitious tax reform. This is not the case for us.\r  \n\r  \n**What avenues do you favour?**\r  \n\r  \nThere is the possibility of doing so by means of a tax credit, degressive up to the average wage (to reduce taxation on the lowest incomes, editor's note). The report also talks about the possibility of widening the tax brackets, i.e. staying longer in the same bracket before moving up to a higher bracket when your gross salary increases.\r  \n\r  \n**How can this be financed?**\r  \n\r  \nThe experts suggest ways to target income from assets, which they say is clearly too little taxed, too little present in the overall tax base. To make a real tax shift in this country, to reduce the tax burden on labour, we need to make wealth income contribute more. This includes capital gains on shares and bonds, which are already taxed in almost all neighbouring countries. Even the United States does it, even though it is not a country known for its tax rage.\r  \n\r  \n**Are you talking about partners who are less inclined to do this at federal level?**\r  \n\r  \nThomas Dermine recently said that he no longer believed in tax reform. Yet that is where there is the most scope for change.\r  \n\r  \n**He was talking about large-scale reform, but he was still in favour of reform, wasn't he?**\r  \n\r  \nLet's say that I have the impression that the motivation to carry out tax reform is a little less present among some. In Ecolo, it is extremely present and it is very important. It is necessary for tax justice and purchasing power. We are not going to change everything in a few weeks but the time for procrastination is over. Even if we are from different parties, I hope that we will be able to make progress on this by the end of the year. There is too little contribution from capital and still too many subsidies to fossil fuels.\r  \n\r  \n**Are you thinking about the company car?**\r  \n\r  \nWe want to gradually replace very expensive systems, such as the \"salary car\". It costs between 1.5 and 2 billion euros per year. It no longer makes sense in terms of our climate objectives, and what's more, it's unfair. 15% of workers benefit from it and it's the whole of society that finances it. We need to replace this system and discuss it so as not to penalise those who benefit from it.\r  \n\r  \n**How do you respond to David Clarinval (MR) who believes that the abolition of the petrol card is going in the wrong direction for purchasing power?**\r  \n\r  \nWe need structural reforms, whether it's the petrol card or salary cars, these are systems that we need to get out of.\r  \n\r  \n**Are you completely against company cars? Even electric cars, for example?**\r  \n\r  \nNo... not at all. We're not against cars, by the way. If people want to have a car, that's their choice. Some people need them. The problem is that it is subsidised by the state. And I'm not talking about the company cars of technicians, workers who have to travel to several sites, etc. We are not attacking this system. It is a work tool. But we are attacking the salary car, as a complement to the salary. For people who don't necessarily need them.\r  \n\r  \n**MR is blocking?**  \nThe MR vetoed the governmental discussions on this issue in 2020. Today, I think that the world has changed dramatically in two years, as we can see in relation to our dependence on Russian fossil fuels. I do think that such mechanisms should be discussed. Even Georges-Louis Bouchez (president of the MR, editor's note) says that it can be discussed from now on, if the workers lose nothing. It's no longer a veto. So I think that things can move forward. Minds are changing, so much the better.  \n**Some people think that the experts' report contains too many clich\u00e9s and not enough figures. What do you think?**  \nNot everything has been quantified to the last carat, but it is up to the politicians to decide. So that's normal. But the report gives figures, on labour taxation and so on. It is a good basis for work. The findings are objective. I don't like everything in the report either, but it's going in the right direction.  \n**What don't you like?**  \nThere are some things I would like to look into, such as the change in alimony payments and the tax benefits associated with being single or in a couple. We also want to introduce environmental taxation, get rid of subsidies for fossil fuels, do reduced VAT rates on coal or firewood still make sense?  \n**Are there any blockages within Vivaldi?**  \nLet's just say that this reform must be done quickly, before the next elections. The time for action has arrived and it is feasible.  \n**So why wait until September to take political decisions?**  \nThere are still 35 bills to be voted on and there is the August recess. So we have to be realistic, there won't be any concrete projects with figures before September, but it is quite possible by the end of the year. It is necessary to change society and protect purchasing power.  \nTranslated with www.DeepL.com/Translator (free version)", "created_utc": "1657092766.0", "edited": "False", "id": "if1qpoe", "is_submitter": "True", "link_id": "t3_vsk71k", "parent_id": "t3_vsk71k", "score": "36", "subreddit": "belgium", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhe6"}, {"author": "Leiegast", "body": "Some 6086 people were expected on Tuesday morning in Brussels to sit the medical and dental entrance exam (a second session of which will be organised on Saturday 27 August). About 5500 of them actually showed up.\n\nThis is the last entrance exam for these courses. From 2023-2024 onwards, access will be regulated by an entrance exam which, unlike the exam, will only give the green light to a limited number of candidates, who will be selected according to their points. This is the result of the agreement reached in the Inami/Riziv saga.\n\nMeanwhile, the rule has not changed. In order to follow the studies they have chosen, candidates must achieve at least 8/20 in each of the eight subjects assessed. Fifteen multiple-choice questions are proposed in each subject (with one correct answer out of five proposed). The subjects are grouped into two main parts (the scientific subjects: chemistry, biology, physics and mathematics, and the aspects of communication and critical analysis of information). You also need to obtain at least a 10/20 average in each of the two.\n\nWith 6087 expected candidates and 5500 present, we are in the same order of magnitude as last year (6165 inscriptions in July 2021). As usual, students taking the test for the first time are in the majority (75%). Those aiming for medicine are also in the majority (80%). Two thirds are female students. And the proportion of non-residents was again around half (a student is considered a non-resident if he or she cannot prove that his or her main residence is in Belgium). For the first time, it even exceeded one out of two registrants (50.1% on Tuesday, compared to 49.5% last year), but in the end it made up 47% of the candidates actually present.\n\nIt should be remembered that at the end of the test, non-residents cannot represent more than 30% of the successful candidates who will be able to enrol at university. Hundreds of non-resident candidates have been failed in recent years, even though they passed the exam.\n\nThe final assessment of the 2022 edition can of course only be made after the results of the two sessions. For information, the average success rate in recent years has been around 17% (including 19.7% in August 2020, 16.9% in September 2020, 11.6% in July 2021 and 26.7% in August 2021).\n\nTranslated with [www.DeepL.com/Translator](http://www.DeepL.com/Translator) (free version)", "created_utc": "1657035533.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ieycnd9", "is_submitter": "True", "link_id": "t3_vs0pqo", "parent_id": "t3_vs0pqo", "score": "21", "subreddit": "belgium", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhe6"}, {"author": "Leiegast", "body": "Thank you for your service", "created_utc": "1657021100.0", "edited": "False", "id": "iexit3q", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_vrdlev", "parent_id": "t1_ieupbj0", "score": "11", "subreddit": "YUROP", "subreddit_id": "t5_2wivw"}, {"author": "Leiegast", "body": ">Brusseleer\n\nJust a small correction, but 'Brusseleer' is the French name of the Brussels dialect, whereas in Dutch and in the dialect itself it's just called 'Brussels' (like 'Antwaarps': Antwerp dialect; Leives: Leuven dialect etc.).

Countries such as Poland, Slovenia and Romania are now, because of the war in Ukraine, finally full members of the European family.**\n\nAt the European summit last week, Slovenian Prime Minister Robert Golob spoke for 15 minutes about the energy problem in Europe. Remarkable, because this was his first European summit ever. Newcomers mostly listen at first. What was even more remarkable was that Golob also spoke on behalf of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg. He did it skilfully and with authority. He was for a long time the director of a successful energy company and is one of Slovenia's leading 'green' energy experts.\n\nWestern European countries asking a central European politician to speak on their behalf - such a thing would not have happened five years ago. And this is just one example of a remarkable trend in European politics: the slow emancipation of Central Europe. You could almost say that they are finally becoming full members of the club. The war in Ukraine is a major catalyst. \n\nIt often takes years for new countries to find their feet in Brussels. They have to build up a huge network, have compatriots working in European institutions, and master complex dossiers retrospectively. That takes time. Eighteen years after the 2004 enlargement, some Central Europeans still have an inferiority complex - compared to the Dutch or Belgians who were there from the start. According to Bulgarian political scientist Ivan Krastev, the feeling that you are always trying to imitate Western Europe fuelled the democratic regression in Poland, Hungary and elsewhere: awe turned to resentment.\n\n**Frontline state Poland**\n\nBut things are changing. Central Europe is the area between Germany and Russia. When the two had good relations, it was sometimes unclear where Central Europe stood. Now that Germany and Russia are growing apart, that ambiguity disappears: Central Europe belongs with us.\n\nLook at Poland. In recent years it has manoeuvred itself into a corner by violating European rules on the rule of law. The European Commission withheld Polish funds. Ministers from other countries hardly ever visited Poland. It was bypassed in foreign policy consultations among large countries.\n\nBut when Russia invaded Ukraine, everything changed. Ukraine is at the top of the EU's priority list. Suddenly, 'frontline state' Poland, which always warned of the Russian danger, takes centre stage. It receives millions of refugees and is a key country militarily, in the defence of NATO territory and for arms supplies to Ukraine. Ministers and heads of government are visiting Poland again. The first person to raise the issue of Ukraine's EU membership in Brussels, three days after the invasion, was a Pole. The country is using this to get rid of the rule of law problem, and is making concessions to unblock its EU funds. It's not enough yet, Eurocommissioner Vera Jourova, a Czech, said Thursday. But the movement in itself is fascinating.\n\n**It will be fine**\n\nThe Visegrad group, in which four central European countries spent years seeking cover for each other (mainly to block things in Brussels) has completely evaporated - only Hungary is duking it out with Putin, the rest support Ukraine. One of Europe's new leaders is the Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas. The Czech Republic, Slovakia and Slovenia have thrown out authoritarian leaders, are trying to repair the rule of law and fight corruption. The EU anti-corruption boss is a Romanian sharp-shooter, Laura Kovesi. Even the critical Dutch MEP Sophie in 't Veld recently noted: 'The parts of the European rule of law that are on the rise are strikingly often in the east.'\n\nIn Brussels, this fledgling momentum is palpable. Now that the Danish Secretary-General of European President Charles Michel has left, support is growing for a Romanian candidate (if only to cut off the French ambassador). The Ukraine coordinator at the Commission is a Slovakian.

This was announced on the party's Family Day at Plopsaland. Mahdi was the only candidate and was elected with almost 97 percent of the votes from the voting CD&V members. He succeeds Joachim Coens, who stepped aside after a devastating poll. In his first speech, Mahdi stated that CD&V must now first and foremost make clear what it stands for: a community party that does not patronise, but protects. He sneered at the Vooruit party, the liberals and Groen.**\r  \n\r  \nSammy Mahdi is State Secretary for Asylum and Migration in the current federal government. Two and a half years ago, he had to give way to Coens in the presidential elections, but now he is the only candidate to succeed him. With 96.86 percent, he has now been elected by the voting members of his party. \"It is very nice to get a big mandate,\" he addressed his party after the results were announced. \"These are going to be very tough times, but I am happy that I can count on so much support. We're going to put a patch on it, rest assured.\"\r  \n\r  \nMahdi now has to get CD&V out of the electoral doldrums. Coens resigned after the results of \"De stemming\" were announced, a poll by VRT NWS and De Standaard. It showed that only 8.7 percent of those questioned would still vote for CD&V - 6.7 percentage points less than the result CD&V achieved in the Flemish elections of 2019. CD&V would thus become the smallest party in Flanders.\r  \n\r  \n**Plans**\r\n\nMahdi says he knows only too well how big the challenge is. \"We have to be humble,\" he addressed his party in his first speech as chairman. \"We have to make sure that the party stands up again. That is not easy, because if you ask people what CD&V is or what Christian Democracy is, far too often people remain indifferent to our party. They don't know exactly what we stand for, even though we have the best people. And as Christian Democrats it is important to know what the big challenges are that people face.\"\r  \n\r  \n\"People are worried about a world that is changing faster and faster, a world where it is harder for them to get their bills paid, where they feel that they are losing social connection. We, better than anyone, have to give people answers to those questions. That starts with believing in our ideology and knowing what we stand for, but above all: by putting our foot where it should be, drawing the line at times when things get difficult and when we, as Christian Democrats, say 'This far and no further'.\"\r  \n\r  \nFor example, Mahdi believes that people are too \"patronised by the government\". \"If you look at recent times, I see that there are parties who think they have to patronise youth clubs and young people when they are at camp and may or may not be drinking a beer. There are parties that think they have to patronise parents who, after six months (parental leave ed.), still want to look after their child themselves instead of handing it over to the government.\" The latter is a sneer at Vooruit chairman Conner Rousseau, who wants children in daycare after just six months. \r  \n\r  \n\"We as a party believe in responsibility: also for the teachers who work hard every day and with more responsibility and freedom can ensure more quality,\" Mahdi continued. This was followed by a sneer at the Liberals. \"We don't believe in a world that liberals stand for: a world of individualism, selfishness, a world where everyone has to do their own thing.\"\r  \n\r  \nAs a \"community party\", Mahdi also wants to protect people at times when they need it. \"We want to protect people at the times when they need it: when young families struggle to pay their bills at the end of the month, when older people struggle to make ends meet with their pensions, when people work all year and still struggle to make ends meet because of rising energy costs and the more expensive shopping trolley.\" And there Mahdi already draws a first line: \"The index, one of the most important instruments for protecting people's purchasing power, is not touched.\"\r  \n\r  \nMahdi then called on the other parties to show their colours. \"Before the summer recess, we will put a tax reform on the table that will reduce the burden on labour. It will be up to the other parties to make it clear that they no longer want to be world champions in taxes on labour. Let us know!\"  \nFinally, Mahdi stressed that his \"community party\" is thinking of all generations. \"We want to make the world a better place for people here and now, but also for all the generations that will come after us.\" This was followed by a sneer at Groen. \"CD&V is the oldest green party and we are the only sensible green party, we will not saddle the next generation with the debts of the current generation. We will make sure that the next generation is better off.\"  \nIt will be announced on Monday who will succeed Mahdi as State Secretary for Asylum and Migration.  \nTranslated with www.DeepL.com/Translator (free version)", "created_utc": "1656161730.0", "edited": "False", "id": "idokwr6", "is_submitter": "True", "link_id": "t3_vkeftu", "parent_id": "t3_vkeftu", "score": "4", "subreddit": "belgium", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhe6"}, {"author": "Leiegast", "body": "The youth ticket (previously called GO Pass) is valid for 1 journey from one station to another.

She wants to see how she can send 20 extra police officers to Molenbeek, but at the same time she points out the responsibility of other actors. \n\n**No taboo**\n\nVerlinden is looking at Brussels Prime Minister Rudi Vervoort, among others, she answered in the Chamber to questions from Fran\u00e7ois De Smet (D\u00e9FI), Maxime Pr\u00e9vot (Les Engag\u00e9s), Philippe Pivin (MR), Ahmed Laaouej (PS), Franky Demon (CD&V) and Julie Chanson (Ecolo). Since the sixth state reform, the Prime Minister has had a coordinating role in the security policy in the 19 Brussels municipalities. A government bill will soon be tabled to extend these powers even further, so that the Prime Minister can take over authority over all the police zones in the capital in the event of serious security problems. \n\nBut even now, she said, it is important to get the 6,000 police officers in Brussels to work together in the best possible way. \"For me, there is no taboo. The merger of police zones in Brussels is not included in the coalition agreement, but it is a solution for my party.\"  \n\nVerlinden received backing from her party colleague Franky Demon, who said he hoped \"that Vervoort will take responsibility\". The Minister-President and his party (PS) have always opposed a merger of the Brussels police zones, as have most other French-speaking parties.", "created_utc": "1656012586.0", "edited": "False", "id": "idgvq20", "is_submitter": "True", "link_id": "t3_vj4xjs", "parent_id": "t3_vj4xjs", "score": "4", "subreddit": "belgium", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhe6"}, {"author": "Leiegast", "body": "HLN gaat weer heel subtiel om met anonimisering", "created_utc": "1655988599.0", "edited": "False", "id": "idfav7r", "is_submitter": "True", "link_id": "t3_viw5p9", "parent_id": "t3_viw5p9", "score": "14", "subreddit": "belgium", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhe6"}, {"author": "Leiegast", "body": "You've got to instill the clientelism when they're young", "created_utc": "1655983338.0", "edited": "False", "id": "idf20uz", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_vitfmg", "parent_id": "t3_vitfmg", "score": "9", "subreddit": "belgium", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhe6"}, {"author": "Leiegast", "body": "Ik ben gisteren gaan zwemmen in het nieuwe zwembad van Kortrijk en daar zat het vol Maghrebijnse Noord-Fransen.

The aim is both to attract talent to Belgium and to offer Belgian students opportunities in the tech hub Atlanta.**\r  \n\r  \nA signature and an Omer. This was the final word on Monday afternoon on the deal that the West Flemish university college Howest concluded with the American university Georgia State. The programmes specialised in gaming of the two institutions will work closely together over the next five years on matters such as curriculum, research and exchanges of both students and staff.\r  \n\r  \nThe deal was struck on the sidelines of the economic trade mission led by Princess Astrid that has been travelling through the US since Sunday. There, for the first time, the growing Belgian gaming industry had a chance to show itself under the wings of an economic mission. A sign that our sector is maturing,' says David Verbruggen, CEO of the sector federation Belgian Games.\r  \n\r  \n**Fiscal support**\n\n\r  \nThe choice for Atlanta is not coincidental. The state of Georgia has in recent years become a hotbed of activity in the sector. In 2005 we had less than ten game studios here', remembers Andrew Greenberg, the director of the Georgia Game Developers Association. The industry employs more than 4,000 people here, and has an economic impact of 800 million dollars.\r  \n\r  \nThe Belgian sector was only too happy to show off with an extensive event in the buildings of Georgia State. Among other things, a digital avatar was made of Princess Astrid, students competed in the Belgian VR game 'HyperDash' by Ghent game studio Triangle Factory, and Belgian companies such as Meta, which specialises in e-sports, Antwerp developer Cybernetic Walrus and Brussels-based DeMute presented themselves. The latter, which specialises in sound for video games, already works closely in Atlanta with the gaming giant Hi-Rez, maker of the very popular game 'Smite'.\r  \n\r  \n**Best education in the world**\n\n\r  \nBut it is not only entrepreneurs who are attracted by the activity in Georgia. With a structural cooperation with Georgia State, Howest also hopes to reap the benefits of the dynamics in the southern state.\r  \n\r  \nThe digital arts & entertainment programme at Howest in Kortrijk has already been voted the best gaming programme in the world three times. An ecosystem has grown up around it in recent years,' says Frederik D'hulster, director of education and internationalisation at the university college. We also found this here in Atlanta, at the Creative Media Industries Institute. We are doing more or less the same, each with our own emphasis.\r  \n\r  \nThe intention of the collaboration is to connect these two ecosystems, to benefit both, says D'hulster. That can be done in many ways. For example, we are going to harmonise our curricula more, so that exchanges of students and teachers become easier. But we are also going to cooperate in the field of research, want to learn from each other how we can best support start-ups, or help each other establish links with local companies to provide students with good work placements.\r  \n\r  \nSomething is really brewing here,' says D'hulster. You notice that many tech companies are leaving Silicon Valley to settle further south, because it is still affordable here. That's a dynamic we want to capitalize on.'\r  \n\r  \nGeorgia State's gaming education program is also growing like a rocket. This year, 900 students are enrolled, more than triple the number of students enrolled five years ago when the program was first offered. At Howest, about 700 students start a gaming course each year.\r  \n\r  \nTranslated with www.DeepL.com/Translator (free version)", "created_utc": "1654674145.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ibl1kuv", "is_submitter": "True", "link_id": "t3_v7jvvq", "parent_id": "t3_v7jvvq", "score": "4", "subreddit": "belgium", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhe6"}, {"author": "Leiegast", "body": "Most Flemish say fruitsap (fruit juice) even if they actually just mean orange juice, but if they want to be more specific they also use appelsiensap or sinaasappelsap.\n\n>while we Dutch use the proper French word sjuderrans.

Zij kregen de vraag om ongedwongen met elkaar te babbelen \u00e9n om\r dat bovendien in standaardtaal te doen.\r   \n>  \n>De West-Vlaamse jongeren hanteren een bipolair model: er is West-Vlaams en er is\r standaardtaal, dat zijn twee duidelijk onderscheiden vari\u00ebteiten. Als de mensen van het\r CGN om standaardtaal vragen, ruilen de West-Vlaamse jongeren hun natuurlijke code\r voor informele gesprekken \u2013 het West-Vlaamse dialect of regiolect \u2013 in voor de andere,\r standaardtalige code. Dat is een systeemwissel, en die gebeurt dan ook tamelijk consequent, zoals bleek uit de gegevens in Grafiek 2: amper 16 % niet-standaardtalige vormen\r bij variatiegevoelige kenmerken. \r  \n>  \n>De jongeren in de andere regio\u2019s hanteren geen bipolair model dialect-standaardtaal,\r maar een ge\u00efntegreerd model omgangstaal-standaardtaal. Wanneer hen door de mensen\r van het CGN om standaardtaal gevraagd wordt, beschouwen ze dat niet als een oproep\r om hun natuurlijke code voor informele gesprekken \u2013 de Vlaamse omgangstaal \u2013 in te\r ruilen voor een compleet andere (standaardtalige) code. Zij beschouwen hun natuurlijke\r omgangstaal min of meer als de standaard-code voor dit soort informele babbels. **Het is\r de standaard in Vlaanderen want vrijwel iedereen uit de spraakmakende regio\u2019s in Vlaanderen \u2013 de Brabantse regio en met uitbreiding Oost-Vlaanderen en Limburg \u2013 spreekt zo,\r thuis, onder vrienden, onder mede-studenten, onder politici, bedrijfsleiders, in reclamespotjes, in soaps, in spelprogramma\u2019s, et cetera.** Om de mensen van het CGN ter wille\r te zijn, worden nu en dan wat knopjes verschoven in de richting van de standaardtaal,\r maar dat gebeurt zonder veel overtuiging en het wordt niet volgehouden. Getuige daar van de scores van gemiddeld rond de 60 % omgangstalige vormen bij variatiegevoelige kenmerken. **Voor deze sprekers is de Vlaamse omgangstaal dus de nieuwe norm-taal of standaard-taal voor de informele communicatie,** en hoeft er hier en daar maar wat te worden bijgesteld om er meer formele spreektaal of schrijftaal van te maken. De overgang van omgangstaal naar wat traditioneel standaardtaal heet, is in hun ogen dus geen systeemwissel, maar een kwestie van beperkte verschuivingen binnen \u00e9\u00e9n systeem: van de norm/standaard-taal voor de informele communicatie naar de norm/standaard-taal voor de meer formele situaties.\n\nBut again, what use is it to actually give you the sources you're asking for if you can't even be bothered to read them.\n\n>What we ask\n\nWho's we? Are you claiming to be the representative of all francophones in Flanders?\n\n>Typical \"whataboutism\" argument. Because they do it, it makes it \"OK\" for you guys to do it as well ?\n\nIt's not a whataboutism. You are saying that people use non-standard language in order to purposefully confuse non-native speakers and make a nationalist statement. I gave you an example of the linguistic situation in the UK, where people also prefer to talk in their local accent, and I asked you what their reasons could be for that?

The focus will be on national languages.\r  \n\r  \n**New training courses, language immersion grants and a reference centre for language teaching**\r  \n\r  \nIn concrete terms, new \"language-trades\" training courses will be organised in qualification training programmes and in trades for which languages are an asset in finding employment.

For jobseekers, up to 1,750 immersion grants (compared with 300 at present) may be awarded, with the amount increased. The conditions for accessing these grants will be relaxed as they will be accessible regardless of the level of study (until now, a bachelor's degree was required). For the latter, approximately 200 long scholarships (of one or two terms) and 1,600 short scholarships (of two to four weeks) in language schools in Belgium, Europe or in companies will be awarded annually.

And yesterday at TF1 a variant on the same theme followed. \n\nThe purpose of Russia's \"special military operation\" is to protect the Russian language and culture. On that point Lavrov made the comparison with our country. He told the French journalist: \"For the West, it was all the same what happened to the Russian language, to Russian education, to the Russian media, which were banned by law. For example, how would France react if Belgium banned the French language?\"\n\n\"Or what would England do if Ireland banned English?\", he added. In Europe, one cannot imagine that. But when it comes to Russian, nobody in Europe cares.\" \n\nThe status of Russian in Ukraine has been a matter of debate for years. Plans by the government to abolish the status of Russian as an officially recognised minority language also caused unrest in the east of the country during the Maidan revolution of 2014. \n\nThe pro-Russian government in Ukraine fell after violent street protests and was succeeded by a government with a pro-Western stance. Since then, laws have also been passed to promote Ukrainian, much to the displeasure of Russia and pro-Russian politicians in Ukraine, among others. \n\n**\"Conquering Donbas is priority\"**\n\nIn the same conversation with TF1, Lavrov stressed that the conquest of the Donbas region in eastern Ukraine is an unconditional priority for Russia. Russia wants to push back the Ukrainian army and thus liberate the Donbas - including the provinces of Luhansk and Donetsk - from the Ukrainian regime. \n\n\"It looks like Luhansk is definitely within reach of the Russians,\" says VRT NWS journalist Jan Balliauw who is currently in Ukraine. \"There has clearly been progress over the past few weeks. By pulling together a large part of the combat troops in the east, they have surprised Ukraine. The Russians have begun to attempt to capture the cities of Severodonetsk and Lisichank with heavy street fighting. They have the upper hand at the moment, but that does not mean that they will just take control of the whole Donbas.\"\n\n\"In Donetsk the Ukrainian defences are stronger, there is hardly any progress there. The contraction of troops in the east makes the Russians more vulnerable in the south. There are signs that Ukraine has started a counterattack there, which will force the Russians to strengthen their positions there again.\"", "created_utc": "1653904257.0", "edited": "False", "id": "iaj0snk", "is_submitter": "True", "link_id": "t3_v0wmvy", "parent_id": "t3_v0wmvy", "score": "6", "subreddit": "europe", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh4j"}, {"author": "Leiegast", "body": "It's ironic how two countries, with different languages, customs etc. manage to set up a common bilingual channel, whereas here in Belgium, we divided everything as much as we could.

The family was not informed for two days, precisely because of the language barrier, Noppen suspected. The woman died, and only then was the family informed.  \n\n\nAccording to Luc D'Hooghe, who was present at the hearing as a GP in Forest and honorary president of the Brussels GPs, and who was the sharpest critic of the lack of bilingualism, this is not an isolated case.  \n\"Of course we cannot say whether this lady died because they could not speak Dutch in the hospital. We know little about the cause of death. But it is not the first time something like this has happened. If the patient is lucky, the hospital calls us, and we can explain to them what the patient is suffering from.\"  \n\n\n**So in general, bilingualism in Brussels hospitals is still poor?**\n\nLuc D'Hooghe: Yes. There has been an improvement, but you have to be lucky. In emergency departments, for example, which have to be bilingual, this is not always the case. With the exception of the UZ Brussel, the Europa hospitals and Sint-Jan, almost everything in Brussels concerning pregnancy, births and post-natal periods is unilingually French. In the Sint-Pietersziekenhuis, for example, there are a few gynaecologists who speak Dutch, but the follow-up with paediatricians or nurses is in French. There, the report may not even be written in Dutch, even though that is the patient's language. This is because the other doctors are not bilingual.  \n\n\n**You gave some other services as an example, which are in practice monolingual French.**\n\nD'Hooghe: Intensive care is unilingually French everywhere except in the UZ Brussel. As far as rehabilitation is concerned, only Scheutbos is still acceptable. And I'm not even talking about compulsory admission. A patient of mine from Ruisbroek was admitted to Saint-Luc with a psychosis. He smashed everything up there because he wasn't understood.  \n\n\n**You also said that Kind & Gezin is not allowed at the bedside in some hospitals.**  \nD'Hooghe: That was the case for a long time in St Peter's Hospital, I don't know if it still is. That place at the bedside was reserved for the French-speaking counterpart ONE. But it must be said that Kind & Gezin is also reducing its services in Brussels.  \n\n\n**How do you know all this? Are there any studies on the subject?**  \nD'Hooghe: No, I know this from my own experience. I have been a GP in Brussels for 43 years and have seen quite a bit in the meantime.  \n\n\n**But perhaps these are anecdotes that cannot be generalised.**  \nD'Hooghe: The directors of the hospitals mentioned above were present at the hearing. They did not contradict me.  \n\n\n**Those directors did indicate that they themselves were committed to language lessons in the hospital itself.**  \nD'Hooghe: The hospitals that were present at the hearing were the best of the class. And there are also improvements. In most hospitals, the management is now at least partly Dutch-speaking, so there is more attention for bilingual services. Some hospitals are also aware that the number of Dutch-speaking patients is declining, as these patients no longer feel like going to a Brussels hospital.  \n\n\n**This in turn reduces the need for hospital staff to learn Dutch. After all, there is nobody to speak it with.**  \nD'Hooghe: That is indeed a vicious circle, because as a result, fewer Dutch-speaking patients go to hospitals, and so on. On top of that, Dutch-speaking doctors prefer to work in Flanders, because they are paid more there, and because in Brussels they risk ending up in a monolingual French environment.  \n\n\n**How can we break this vicious circle?**  \nD'Hooghe: The European Hospitals communicate which doctors can speak Dutch. Then you have the feeling that you can go there, and many people will take that step. In addition, the mentality in Brussels has to change. The negative atmosphere surrounding the other language must be eliminated, and politicians must take the lead in this. Like Emir Kir for instance, the mayor of Sint-Joost-ten Node (independent, ed.). He has learned Dutch in just a few years. Language is about respect, common sense and good manners. Addressing someone in their language, especially if they are a patient, is treating them correctly.  \n\n\n**Yet the willingness to learn Dutch is low.**  \nOnly around 30 of the 1,467 French-speaking GPs on duty are prepared to take language lessons. About 200 are said to be bilingual, because they went to school in Dutch or were raised bilingual at home. The fact that so few GPs take extra language classes is, I think, still down to that mentality.  \n\n\n**What do you expect from politicians now?**  \nD'Hooghe: That the competent ministers, Elke Van den Brandt (Groen, Gezondheid) and Sven Gatz (Open VLD, Meertaligheid), focus more on healthcare, and on guaranteeing bilingualism there. But also that the other national language is taught to pupils and students again, so that they can express themselves fluently in the other language, because many Dutch speakers can't speak French anymore either.  \n\n\n**The hospitals now provide language lessons.**  \nD'Hooghe: But that is not their job. As long as Brussels doesn't promote bilingualism, and as long as people simply resign themselves to not being able to find a Dutch teacher, for example, nothing much will change. So it starts at school, but language should also be part of the training of nurses, physiotherapists and doctors. For if a French-speaking person breaks his leg in Knokke or Ostend, you can at least question him in his own language. And vice versa, the same goes for Flemish people who have a problem in the Ardennes.  \n\n\nLanguage is important, just as important as a stethoscope.

The fact that so few GPs take extra language classes is, I think, still down to that mentality.\n\n**What do you expect from politicians now?**\n\nD'Hooghe: That the competent ministers, Elke Van den Brandt (Groen, Gezondheid) and Sven Gatz (Open VLD, Meertaligheid), focus more on healthcare, and on guaranteeing bilingualism there. But also that the other national language is taught to pupils and students again, so that they can express themselves fluently in the other language, because many Dutch speakers can't speak French anymore either.\n\n**The hospitals now provide language lessons.**\n\nD'Hooghe: But that is not their job. As long as Brussels doesn't promote bilingualism, and as long as people simply resign themselves to not being able to find a Dutch teacher, for example, nothing much will change. So it starts at school, but language should also be part of the training of nurses, physiotherapists and doctors. For if a French-speaking person breaks his leg in Knokke or Ostend, you can at least question him in his own language. And vice versa, the same goes for Flemish people who have a problem in the Ardennes.\n\nLanguage is important, just as important as a stethoscope. A wrong anamnesis (questions the doctor asks the patient, ed.) leads to a wrong diagnosis, which of course reduces the outcome. It wouldn't be the first time that thyroid tests were started because a patient reported having a 'krop in de keel'.", "created_utc": "1652951222.0", "edited": "1652953538.0", "id": "i96jkda", "is_submitter": "True", "link_id": "t3_usz8ck", "parent_id": "t3_usz8ck", "score": "20", "subreddit": "belgium", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhe6"}, {"author": "Leiegast", "body": "D\u00e9 algemene ervaring bestaat niet.

For him, \"Europe needs to equip itself with a defence capable of protecting every European citizen, including Walloon citizens, in the event of aggression.  \nIn the meantime, Wallonia \"a land of solidarity, must welcome Ukrainians who are fleeing the war\", said Elio di Rupo. He emphasised the role of citizen solidarity and the action of the municipalities. \"From now on, we are working with the governors to create reception places in collective structures\", added the Walloon Minister-President.  \n**The Walloon budget: \"maintaining the debt at a bearable level**  \n\"The health crisis and the floods will have cost Wallonia more than three billion euros each,\" Elio di Rupo reminds us.

With an objective of \"a gradual and cumulative reduction in the gross balance of at least 150 million euros per year\", the government is currently embarking on \"the difficult exercise of budgetary adjustment\". \"The evolution of macroeconomic parameters is unfavourable to us by more than 140 million euros\", the Walloon Minister-President specified.  \nAt the end of his speech, Elio di Rupo responded to those who criticise the action of his government. \"Criticism is easy, but art is difficult,\" he said. \"Some people talk about slowness.

Elio Di Rupo said that the government \"faced up instantly\" because his government \"does not want to leave anyone by the wayside\". He highlighted the results obtained in the fight against the pandemic, with a vaccination campaign that was \"a great success\" and thanks to the efforts of \"the population, health care staff and all public authorities\".\r  \n\r  \nTo assess the state of health in the Walloon Region, Elio Di Rupo relies on the statistics of the IWEPS, the Walloon Institute for Evaluation, Forecasting and Statistics.\r  \n\r  \nHe points to the at-risk-of-poverty rate, which fell from 18.2% to 17.7% between 2020 and 2021, and the material and social deprivation rate, which rose from 15.8% to 14.1% over the same period. The number of people receiving a social integration income each month has been decreasing since last summer, according to the Walloon Minister-President, to less than 70,000 people in December 2021. However, for Elio Di Rupo, \"too many households, too many families, too many single people continue to suffer from precariousness\".\r  \n\r  \nFrom an economic point of view, the annual growth rate of the GDP has become positive again in 2021 (5.7%). \"In the last quarter of 2021, Wallonia's GDP has practically returned to its pre-crisis level,\" said Di Rupo. And in 2022, \"the prospects for a continued economic recovery in Wallonia are positive\". IWEPS expects economic growth of 2.5% in Wallonia this year.\r  \n\r  \nHowever, we must \"remain cautious\", says the Walloon Minister-President. \"The direct and indirect negative effects of the war in Ukraine are beginning to be felt,\" he added.\r  \n\r  \nThis recovery of economic activity to levels similar to the period before Covid has had repercussions on the employment market with, in 2021, \"a strong increase in the demand for workers within companies\", according to Elio Di Rupo and a growth in the number of people working on Walloon territory (+1.7% compared to 2020). \"Between the beginning of the year and the end of 2021, nearly 30,000 jobs have been created\", emphasises Elio Di Rupo. The number of unemployed jobseekers also continues to fall, \"below the 200,000 mark in March 2022\". \"Although too high in my eyes, this is a historically low level,\" said Di Rupo.\r  \n\r  \nTo illustrate the health of the Walloon economy, Elio Di Rupo mentions the growth in private investment in 2021 (+9%), public investment (+13.8%), exports, which have seen the strongest annual increase since 2010 (+13.5%) and the rate of business creation (+12.5%), a remarkable development.\r  \n\r  \nElio Di Rupo also highlights the environmental indicators. In 2020, Wallonia emitted 34 million tonnes of greenhouse gases, i.e. 38.5% less than in 1990. He added that efforts will continue thanks to the financial resources made available for the energy renovation of private housing and public buildings. \"More than a billion euros have been set aside for this purpose in the recovery plan,\" said Di Rupo. The creation of nature reserves (more than 1,000 ha), tree planting (1.4 million) and improvements to public transport services are other efforts highlighted by the Walloon Minister-President.\r  \n\r  \n**\"A favourable evolution of Wallonia\"**\n\n  \n\"Despite the various disasters and the many setbacks, Wallonia is firmly on the road to recovery,\" says EIio di Rupo.  \nThe Minister-President then points to a series of measures implemented to support citizens, businesses and local authorities.  \n\"The reform of employment promotion aid (APE) has made more than 65,000 jobs with a high added social value permanent,\" said Di Rupo. In the area of early childhood, the government's plans provide for \"the opening of 3,143 new childcare places\", he added. In the non-profit sector, it is \"a historic agreement\" that will \"improve wages and working conditions\" in this sector. Support for jobseekers was also highlighted, with pilot experiments inspired by the \"zero long-term unemployed territories\" scheme. Elio Di Rupo also highlights a new \"language plan\" geared towards trades. \"Dutch will be a priority\", the Minister-President added.  \nThe Walloon Minister-President also highlights, in the economic field, the effort of nearly one billion euros devoted in 2021 to companies \"to prevent them from sinking because of Covid\".  \nHe also highlights other measures, such as the 220 million euros devoted to the development of the circular economy (\"Circular Wallonia\") and the budget of 1.862 billion euros intended to help farmers and support rural development.  \nThe Minister-President also recalled the development of the tourism sector, which is \"going digital and becoming more professional\", with the \"Visit Wallonia\" brand, \"a transformation that the government actively supports\".", "created_utc": "1652868467.0", "edited": "False", "id": "i9212cv", "is_submitter": "True", "link_id": "t3_us9f4c", "parent_id": "t3_us9f4c", "score": "6", "subreddit": "belgium", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhe6"}, {"author": "Leiegast", "body": ">The Walloon Minister-President, Elio Di Rupo, will give his speech on the state of Wallonia this Wednesday.

I was talking about the establishment of a fixed language border. That was a demand from Flemish politicians.\n\nI interpreted OP's comment as hinting to the fact that Belgium was divided into two large monolingual regions (besides Brussels) instead of the idea of the two languages being official across the country, which was rejected by Walloon politicians for the reasons I mentioned above. What you're referring to was a mechanism for adding some flexibility to the principle of monolingual regions, \n\n>The system that was adopted in the 1930s was that there would be a flexible language border. Each census would update it to reflect the reality of the population on the ground. If a village was in large majority of one language, then that would be the only official language there. But if the minority community reached 30% of the population, then the village would become bilingual. After the 1947 census, many Flemish villages reached that 30% threshold, or even 50% and flipped from only Flemish to bilingual or even only French. That's when the system was abandoned at the request of Flanders. One last swap of villages from one region to the other happened when the linguistic border was definitely fixed, and then it basically didn't move since then, except for the split of Brabant.\n\nWell of course Francophones weren't demanding a change to that mechanism, because it was clearly working in their favour. In general, Flemish people interpreted bilingualism as a **duty** to know both languages, because their language carried a lower level of social status, whereas Francophones interpreted it as a **right** to only having to speak French, because they French carried a higher status. This led to the inevitable fact that official bilingualism became unofficial French monolingualism. Just look at what happened in villages like Linkebeek or Wezembeek after WW II. They didn't call it the Brussels oil spill for nothing.\n\nBut there's a very clear pattern throughout the last hundred years that shows that francophone politicians, and Walloon ones specifically, did everything in their power to limit the influence Dutch in their regions. First the monolingual territory principle, then the language counts that worked in their favour, and also the fact that Dutch is not even a mandatory subject in school.\n\nSo I find it disingenous and/or ignorant to portray Flanders as being the only one that tried to protect their language community through legal and also informal ways.", "created_utc": "1652524255.0", "edited": "False", "id": "i8k8zz0", "is_submitter": "True", "link_id": "t3_uonpu5", "parent_id": "t1_i8jp4sj", "score": "1", "subreddit": "belgium", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhe6"}, {"author": "Leiegast", "body": "[No he's right about Walloons not wanting Dutch being official there:](https://www.lalibre.be/belgique/2003/01/06/un-jour-la-belgique-a-rate-le-train-du-bilinguisme-HRWGPNLDZFCTJO2L3LEVQWPOJQ/)\n\n`Notre syst\u00e8me pr\u00f4ne un unilinguisme exclusif attach\u00e9 \u00e0 un territoire\u00b4, constate Paul Wynants, doyen des facult\u00e9s Notre-Dame de la Paix \u00e0 Namur et auteur d'un ouvrage consacr\u00e9 \u00e0 l'histoire de l'enseignement. `Le tournant a eu lieu dans les ann\u00e9es trente, quand les francophones ont refus\u00e9 l'inscription du bilinguisme au niveau belge.

'The turning point came in the 1930s, when the French-speaking population refused to accept bilingualism at Belgian level. It should be remembered that this proposal was then the result of the demands of the Flemish Movement.' In a state dominated by a French-speaking elite, the latter demanded above all bilingualism in Flanders, which had been achieved in stages from 1883 onwards. First in secondary education, then in the universities, recalls Paul Wynants. 'The next step was to obtain absolute equality of languages,' he continues. 'Either bilingualism throughout Belgium or regional unilingualism.' The French-speaking community felt that bilingualism throughout the country was too great a concession. On 14 July 1932, a law was passed making education unilingual. Fran\u00e7ois Bovesse, a leading figure in French-speaking socialism, played the bird of ill omen: 'Bilingualism is dead, no one will bring it back to life'. In Flanders, a transitional regime was set up for the French-speakers present: the transmutation classes.\n\nThe francophones were against bilingualism in Wallonia because (1) that meant civil servants would have to be bilingual and most of them weren't (funny how that's still the case almost a hundred years later) and (2) they were afraid that Flemish migrant workers in the Walloon cities would start to demand schooling and services in their language and form their own communities (basically what happened in the villages around Brussels in the 60s but they were richer so they did get their way for some time).", "created_utc": "1652476039.0", "edited": "1652506138.0", "id": "i8i132f", "is_submitter": "True", "link_id": "t3_uonpu5", "parent_id": "t1_i8gp717", "score": "1", "subreddit": "belgium", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhe6"}, {"author": "Leiegast", "body": "**Far right leaders Filip Dewinter (Vlaams Belang) and Geert Wilders (PVV) did not get far on their walk in Sint-Joost-ten-Node.

Both politicians were not allowed to go beyond the border.\n\nThe original idea was to head for Molenbeek, but Mayor Catherine Moureaux forbade that on Thursday evening. Afterwards, on Friday morning, a ban was also imposed in the municipalities of Anderlecht, Sint-Joost-ten-Node and Schaarbeek.\n\n**Council of State**\n\nAfter their 'islamic safari' in Molenbeek in 2017, it is now the second time that the far right leaders are not allowed to enter a Brussels municipality. Dewinter announced that he will go to the Council of State again to challenge the decision. In 2021, the politicians were proven right that the 2017 Molenbeek police ordinance was unjustified.\n\n\"I am ashamed that as a politician I am not able to establish what needs to be established: that the municipalities are completely Islamised. That is what the mayors do not want to show,\" Dewinter declared. \"This is not a police regulation, but a fatwa and it shows that Islam is in control here,\" the Vlaams Belang member of parliament continued.\n\nGeert Wilders joins his colleague and emphasises that he has already visited many countries and Islamic regions, but that he has never experienced this. \"We wanted to show that this is a piece of Western territory, where we are losing our own culture and values. I have never understood why we are stopped here on the doorstep. I have no words for that,\" said Wilders.\n\nThe Dutch politician also lashed out at Molenbeek's mayor Catherine Moureaux (PS), as he stressed that they wanted to walk through Molenbeek in a peaceful manner. \"Mayor Moureaux apparently finds it more important to accommodate the followers of Islam. Thus Molenbeek has become your most prominent local caliphate, a de facto no-go zone for parlemetarians. That is an unacceptable capitulation,\" Wilders believes.\n\n**Submitting an application**\n\nSince it is just a walk, both gentlemen were asked why they still submit an application to the municipalities and mayors involved.

At the Werkhuizenkaai on the canal, nightclub LIFT will open its doors in the autumn. Their intention is clear: to become the largest discotheque in Belgium, and even in Europe. The club is pulling out all the stops for this, from big artists to an extravagant venue. \"We want to bring the atmosphere of the big clubs in Ibiza and Miami to Belgium.**\n\nWith a surface area of 1360m2 and a capacity of 2,000 people, LIFT wants to raise the reputation of Brussels nightlife a little more. Founder of the discotheque Olivier Da Silva found his inspiration in Ibiza and Las Vegas, among other places. \"We want to become a real big size club, LIFT has to become the reference,\" says Da Silva.\n\nThe nightclub already had 20 lasers, 500 light effects and pyrotechnics, and an expensive sound system installed in the space. \"This is of an unprecedented level in Belgium, and we hope to be able to bring the best quality for our partygoers,\" says Phillipe De Ryck, ambassador of LIFT to BRUZZ.\n\nIn order to avoid noise nuisance, LIFT had double concrete walls installed and blinded safety doors. \"It is a real soundproof bunker,\" says Da Silva.\n\nBesides the impressive venue, LIFT also wants to show off the biggest names in the music industry. The nightclub does not yet want to say which artists and DJs are on the agenda. \"We keep the music very international, we don't want to stick to one style. The more diverse, the better\", says De Ryck. The programme will only be announced this autumn.\n\n**Safety**\n\nThe nightclub wants to keep the atmosphere as safe as possible for its partygoers and staff. During the press conference, which BRUZZ was able to attend, they frequently hammered on the safety ethics that will prevail. \"One person from our team has completely focused on the safety of both staff and visitors,\" says De Ryck. Everyone in the room, De Ryck emphasises, will have a radio to report any problems immediately.\n\n\"We will provide a safe zone at the entrance, should anyone feel a bit down or should something happen to them. We have absolute zero tolerance for undesirable behaviour and intimidation. This will be dealt with severely,\" says De Ryck. \"There are cameras everywhere to keep an eye on things.\n\nLIFT will deploy shuttle buses that travel throughout the capital. In addition, the club is working with the company MODERN CAR to offer a luxury service for VIPs and clients of large hotel chains.\n\n**History**\n\nDa Silva opened a caf\u00e9 by the canal back in 2003: the Fiesta Bar. A few years later, this was transformed into the famous party tent, the Fiesta Club. When former Brussels mayor Freddy Thielemans (PS) announced the Docks Bruxsel project in 2010, Da Sliva seized his chance. He saw the potential in the changing neighbourhood and applied for a building permit, which he eventually received in 2017.\n\nDa Silva was among other things the driving force behind Fiesta K-Nal and Fiesta Louise in the capital, and then expanded his concept to Liege. In 2014, Da Silva launched a luxury hotel and restaurant project in Marrakesh. He then returned to Brussels.\n\n**Top 5 in Europe**\n\n\"We have actually been ready since 2020, we are very happy that we can finally show our project to the world,\" Da Silva continued. The club expects a grandiose future and wants to be among the top five in Europe three years after opening.\n\n\"Brussels should become not only the administrative but also the party capital of Europe. We dream of reaching the level of the big clubs of Ibiza, Miami, Berlin or Saint-Tropez,\" concludes Da Sliva. \"I am convinced that Brussels has the potential to become a reference in European nightlife\".", "created_utc": "1652456353.0", "edited": "False", "id": "i8gp8gh", "is_submitter": "True", "link_id": "t3_uoudpy", "parent_id": "t3_uoudpy", "score": "2", "subreddit": "belgium", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhe6"}, {"author": "Leiegast", "body": "Peter Van de Veire can be funny at times, but sometimes it's very cringy", "created_utc": "1652392199.0", "edited": "False", "id": "i8dgu9n", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_uobsfi", "parent_id": "t1_i8df04a", "score": "8", "subreddit": "eurovision", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rsu8"}, {"author": "Leiegast", "body": "Gern gesehen", "created_utc": "1652377023.0", "edited": "False", "id": "i8ceny8", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_unz8n2", "parent_id": "t1_i8c6zlz", "score": "2", "subreddit": "Fahrrad", "subreddit_id": "t5_33emc"}, {"author": "Leiegast", "body": "Im norden Belgiens, aka Flandern, sprechen wir au niederl\u00e4ndisch.

If the Flemish people feel represented by a politician, then by De Wever.**\r  \n\r  \nBy which politician do you feel best represented at this moment? This was asked for the third year in a row in De Stemming, the opinion poll conducted by the University of Antwerp and the VUB on behalf of De Standaard and VRT.Nws. The almost 2,000 Flemish people questioned were not given a list of names, but had to provide one themselves. According to researchers Stefaan Walgrave (UA) and Jonas Lefevere (VUB), this resulted in more spontaneous answers.\r  \n\r  \nNo fewer than one in three Flemings (32%) explicitly state that they do not feel represented by any politician, about the same number as in last year's survey. Amongst those who do give a name, the name of N-VA chairman Bart De Wever stands out. He transcends his party, but above all, he determines the success of the N-VA to a large extent. More than half of the people who say they are going to vote for N-VA, do so because he is the chairman. Almost a third of those people would even follow De Wever if he would join another party. That remains a virtual thought exercise, of course, but it says something about the enduring appeal of De Wever, who has been chairman of the N-VA since 2004, although with Zuhal Demir and Theo Francken, there are two politicians who are also growing.\r  \n\r  \n**Rousseau gradually catches up with De Croo**\r  \n\r  \nBart De Wever remains the uncrowned king of Flanders. There is no wear and tear on him', according to Walgrave and Lefevere. In 2021, De Wever was overtaken once by federal prime minister Alexander De Croo (Open VLD), but in 2022, De Wever is back on his throne. De Croo, on the other hand, is losing a lot of followers, possibly because the Prime Minister was less in the limelight as he was during the covid crisis as chairman of the Consultative Committee (Overlegcomit\u00e9/Comit\u00e9 de concertation).\r  \n\r  \nDe Croo is even almost overtaken by Conner Rousseau, who is making huge strides as chairman of Vooruit. In three years' time, he has become one of the most popular politicians in Flanders, almost rivalling the Prime Minister', the researchers conclude. Meanwhile, Rousseau is also recruiting outside his own red church and there are even voters who would follow him to another party.\r  \n\r  \n**CD&V and Groen: invisible**\r  \n\r  \nVlaams Belang chairman Tom Van Grieken also has a solid following, although he barely reaches people who do not vote for Vlaams Belang. In addition, it is especially noticeable who scores poorly, such as Flemish Minister-President Jan Jambon (N-VA), who, together with his Deputy First Minister Ben Weyts (N-VA), is completely disappearing. CD&V and Groen also have political staff that does not have a broad appeal. CD&V's last hope, Sammy Mahdi, is not yet very popular, and chairman Joachim Coens is completely invisible. Minister Annelies Verlinden has the best track record yet.

The Mons Court of Appeal ordered the immediate arrest of the Van Eyken couple, who were taken to the Mons prison.**\r  \n\r  \nThe Mons Court of Appeal on Tuesday sentenced former Flemish parliament member Christian Van Eyken to 20 years in prison and his wife Sylvia B. to 22 years in prison for the murder of Marc Dellea, her ex-partner, in July 2014. Marc Dellea was shot in the head in the Laeken flat he shared with Sylvia B. There was no sign of a break-in. Neither the weapon nor the victim's mobile phone was found. CCTV footage from the hall of the building shows the defendants leaving the flat on the night of the crime. Marc Dellea was not heard from again.\r  \n\r  \nThe sentence is \"slightly less\" for Mr. Van Eyken because it appears from the file that the animosity towards the victim is more important in the head of Sylvia B., who also has a certain ascendancy over her husband, the judgment notes.\r  \n\r  \n**23 to 27 years**\r  \n\r  \nIn September 2019, the Brussels criminal court found them guilty of the crime and sentenced them to 23 years in prison. The couple, who fiercely deny any involvement in Mr Dellea's death, had appealed against this judgment. In February 2021, the appeal court confirmed their guilt and increased the sentence to 27 years in prison. The Van Eyken couple were arrested at the hearing.\r  \n\r  \nThey remained in prison for four months until the Court of Cassation partially overturned the ruling on the sentence. The High Court ruled that the appeal judges had violated the rights of the defence by relying on the couple's persistent denial to justify the increased sentence.\r  \n\r  \nThe case was then sent back to the Mons Court of Appeal, which was to retry the two defendants, but only on the sentence. The couple had already been found guilty twice.\r  \n\r  \nAt the end of a curious trial, which mainly reopened the debates on the merits of the case, the penalty was set on Tuesday, slightly lower than in the first instance. The Mons Court of Appeal took into account the absence of any previous criminal record.

We want this person to start a year in advance, on 1 September 2022, so that he or she can participate in the development of the school and the recruitment of staff.\n\n**Establishing a new school is no mean feat?**\n\nVan de Velde: The project fascinates us enormously, we are very motivated, but it is a very difficult task, with major financial consequences for the school board.\n\n**You are still looking for sponsors and generous donors. Can you manage without them?**\n\nVan de Velde: Financially it is very difficult. We had to buy the site ourselves, an expense of several million. Then we subscribed to the Design-Build-Finance-Maintain call from the Flemish government. In the meantime, a consortium has been selected that will design, build, finance and maintain the school for thirty years. We have to pay a so-called availability fee to the consortium during that time. The government subsidises this for about 75 per cent. The rest is for us.Moreover, the government does not intervene in the costs of education in the beginning. For instance, we do not receive any operating funds during the first year and we also have to pay the first year's salary of the staff ourselves.\n\n**Should the government do more?**\n\nVan de Velde: The government asks school boards to please establish schools to solve the capacity problem. Then you have to run the whole first year without one euro of subsidy. That is not logical.\n\nTranslated with [www.DeepL.com/Translator](http://www.DeepL.com/Translator) (free version)", "created_utc": "1650724686.0", "edited": "False", "id": "i5vrpvt", "is_submitter": "True", "link_id": "t3_ua6nuy", "parent_id": "t1_i5vrnwj", "score": "2", "subreddit": "belgium", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhe6"}, {"author": "Leiegast", "body": "**September next year, the Dutch-speaking Jesuit school Egied Van Broeckhoven will open in Molenbeek. It will be a school with, besides general secondary education, also technical and vocational education, a first for the Jesuits. \"Our elitist image is largely outdated,\" says Eddy Van de Velde of Ignatius Scholen in Beweging.**\n\nThe school has found its home in the former Vandenheuvel brewery at West Station, which after closure was transformed into a depot for wine trader Cinoco. When the wine company left Brussels a few years ago, the non-profit organisation Ignatius Scholen in Beweging, the group of Jesuit schools in Brussels and the periphery, bought a large part of the site.\n\nThe old premises are to be thoroughly renovated and a new building constructed. Pending the start of the building work, the non-profit association made the warehouse available to some ten organisations, including the Brussels Boxing Academy and the theatre group Koekelbergse Alliantie van Knutselaars. Samenlevingsopbouw Brussel (Saamo) was given the entire top floor to create living boxes for the homeless. Now that the building permit has been issued, all temporary projects must be dismantled. These days, the building is in full swing. Next month we want to start the construction,\" says Eddy Van de Velde, longtime headmaster of Sint-Jan Berchmanscollege and now general director of the non-profit organisation Ignatius Scholen in Beweging.\n\n**The construction starts, but you have been working on the plan for a new secondary school for much longer. Why did you take this initiative?**\n\nEddy Van de Velde: We have indeed been working on the plan for five years, because we want to contribute to solving the school shortage in Brussels. There is a big capacity problem in secondary education. In the past ten years, there has been a large increase in the number of places in primary education. Now those children have to go to secondary school, but there are not enough schools.\n\nMoreover, with this project, we want to broaden and show that we can push our limits.\n\n**Show that the Jesuits are not elitist?**\n\nVan de Velde: The elitist character is an image that haunts us, but it is largely outdated. Of course, there are still many parents who consciously choose for the anti-social education of the Jesuit colleges and often those parents belong to the more affluent classes.\n\nBut our school population has also evolved considerably and become much more mixed. The Brussels enrolment procedure applies to our schools as well. The Sint-Jan Berchmanscollege has thirty percent GOK-pupils (GOK stands for equal educational opportunities, ed.).\n\n**Elitist also means that you like to work with the strongest pupils.**\n\nVan de Velde: We have also been dragging that idea along for years, but it is not true. According to our educational concept we work with all students and try to get the best out of each child. In the new school that will work even better, because we no longer focus solely on aso, but also offer vocational and technical education in two domains: STEM, the technical-scientific courses, and Society and Welfare, the care courses.\n\nWe hope to do a six-year course with students who are interested in one of those two domains. There will be a lot of guidance and we will work with flexible learning paths. But, should a reorientation be necessary, it can be done without the pupil having to leave the school, because that is very demotivating for pupils. It is seen as failure, also by the teachers. I was headmaster of the Sint-Jan Berchmanscollege for a long time and I always found it very regrettable when a pupil left prematurely. You then have the feeling that you have not been able to finish your work.\n\nIn any case, we want to avoid pupils leaving unqualified. That is a very big problem in Brussels.\n\n**Often it is the parents who insist that their child follow aso.**\n\nVan de Velde: That is true. There is still the idea that aso has a greater value than tso and bso. We want to break that. That is why we will set up joint projects with young people from bso, tso and aso. By making it a close-knit group, we hope that the pupils will look at each other with respect and see the value of each other's degree.\n\n**Unlike the Don Bosco schools, for example, the Jesuits have no experience of technical or vocational education. How do you think you can make a difference?**\n\nVan de Velde: In Flanders, the Jesuit network has already expanded a bit. A while ago in Turnhout we took over a nurses' school with tso and bso.It will certainly be a challenge, but I am convinced that we can also provide quality technical and vocational education. Since the beginning of this year, we have been working on the development of the pedagogical concept. A task force has been set up and there will be working groups. These include people who have experience in bso and tso. So we surround ourselves well.\n\n**Why the choice for Sint-Jans-Molenbeek?**\n\nVan de Velde: We looked for a long time. It is not easy to find a site for a new school in a city like Brussels. During our search we deliberately focused on the poorer crescent, Anderlecht, Molenbeek and Schaarbeek. Because we think that in those neighbourhoods the challenges are the greatest.In the end, we found this building in Molenbeek. We received many questions about it. After the terrorist attacks, Molenbeek has been in the news very negatively. We want to make it a positive story. Jesuits are often in places that might scare others. There are social fault lines here, and that is important for our project. Our core mission is education, but we also see this school as a social project. A lot of organisations will be able to come here after school hours.\n\n**Most of the young people in this neighbourhood are French or non-Flemish speaking, many are Muslim. Isn't it strange to open a Flemish Jesuit school here?**\n\nVan de Velde: There is a huge demand for Dutch-speaking education in Brussels. Many non-Dutch-speaking parents realise that it is an enormous advantage to speak Dutch, to be multilingual.That is why we will focus firmly on Dutch, but other languages are also important. We want to make a school with the people from this neighbourhood and we will not be rigid when it comes to language, but it is a Dutch-speaking school.\n\n**Where everyone gets a Catholic education.**\n\nVan de Velde: That is the programme of a Catholic school. We are not missionaries, we do not want to convert our pupils, but we do have our own convictions and we share them.At the same time, we will leave room for other philosophies of life. During the religion classes, bridges can be made to other religions.

Yesterday, the Justice Commission gave the green light for that. The federal parliament still has to approve the proposal, but that shouldn't be more than a formality. A good thing, says Daan Bauwens of Utsopi, an interest group of and for sex workers. \"This opens the door to rules and a statute.\"**\n\nSexual criminal law in our country dates back to the nineteenth century and could therefore use an update. \"Everything was in a grey zone,\" says Daan Bauwens of Utsopi, an interest group of and for sex workers. He is therefore grateful that the commission's proposal paves the way for sex work to be written out of the penal code. \"This opens the door to rules and a statute.\"\n\nBecause that's where the problem currently lies for sex workers in our country: they have no social status. Voluntary prostitution is not prohibited in principle, but the organisation of it is. That prohibition is there to prevent exploitation and human trafficking, but in practice it means that sex workers cannot get an accountant or take out a loan from the bank.\n\n**Exploitation and exploitation**\n\n\"It is just a chaotic situation,\" Bauwens explains. Everything to do with sex work was criminalised. \"That meant that the whole sector could not be subject to any regulations, which made it very difficult to draw the line between exploitation and exploitation.\" \n\nThis is a fundamental difference for sex workers who are employed. \"They work for an operator. That is someone who, with respect for safety and hygiene rules, runs a business where people are employed. Those rules do not exist at the moment. That is only possible now, because it is no longer in the penal code.\"\n\nCertainly do not call an operator a pimp, says Bauwens. \"A pimp is an exploiter, anyway. We want to draw that line. Exploitation of prostitution remains in the penal code.\"\n\nThis decision is only a start and will not solve all the problems for sex workers, but it does open the door to a framework for doing sex work properly, says Bauwens. \"That would mean that individuals could work and build up the same social rights, such as pension rights, as any other worker in our country.\"\n\nAn important twilight zone for anyone working with a sex worker will also disappear.\n\n\"For self-employed sex workers, this bill will decriminalise the 'third party',\" Bauwens explains. \"These are, for example, bank directors of banks who give an account or a loan to a sex worker, insurers or persons who rent out a space to a sex worker to do sex work there. Those third parties are taken out of the criminal law, so that self-employed sex workers can organise their jobs like other self-employed people.\"\n\nFor sex worker Veronique, this would change a lot, she testifies in \"Laat\", \"I'm now going to be able to say to my accountant that we can come out for our cooperation. I'm going to be able to go to the bank to apply for a loan, because that wasn't possible. Moreover, I am also going to be able to negotiate correctly, which was not possible before because I simply did not have a strong position. I had nothing. But now that twilight zone has fallen away.\"\n\n**Corona crisis**\n\nEspecially when something bad happens, like the corona crisis, that lack of status plays tricks on many sex workers. \"In black, in grey, there are many different ways to work as a sex worker, but nobody knows what those people are entitled to,\" Bauwens outlines the problem.\n\nAccording to Minister of Justice Vincent Van Quickenborne (Open VLD), this proposal is therefore an important step forward. \"We are finally giving sex workers what they are entitled to: recognition and protection. If this is now approved in plenary, they will be able to do their job with equal rights. Until now, they fell between the cracks, and especially with corona, we have seen that there was insufficient protection for our sex workers.\"\n\nWithout the corona crisis, this adjustment would probably not even have come about, Bauwens thinks. \"Corona really set this in motion. There is now much more openness towards sex work. We now have to start from the facts on the ground and not just from the stereotypes that everyone keeps clinging to. We worked on this for ten months with a lot of blood, sweat and tears.

Every club will have to set up a \"safe zone\" and security staff will have to follow a training course. \"Zero risk does not exist, but this is a huge step forward.\"**\r  \n\r  \nIn October last year, two Elsene bars were targeted after testimonies circulated of young women being raped after being drugged. It is a phenomenon that is not limited to those bars, it quickly became apparent. On Instagram, the Balance Ton Bar (expose your bar) page collected more than 70 other testimonies of similar events, all over Brussels.\r  \n\r  \nFour months later, the City of Brussels launched an action plan to ensure that not only women but also gender minorities feel safer when going out.\r  \n\r  \n\"The campaign is based on two principles: men must change and we believe the victims,\" says Mayor Philippe Close (PS) from nightclub Fuse, with some campaign posters in the background. \"If it's not yes, it's no!\" \"Am I saying no? Stop it.\" \"There's enough atmosphere in the house, keep your hands to yourself.\" \"Those posters should be in all the nightclubs in Brussels,\" Close continues.\r  \n\r  \n**77 measures**\r  \n\n\nThe campaign goes beyond putting up posters. The City of Brussels has listed 76 other measures, many of which are prevention and awareness-raising measures, not only in nightlife but also in education, for example. \"We don't just want to protect girls, but also educate boys. That starts at school,\" says Alderman for Equal Opportunities Lydia Mutyebele Ngoi (PS). \"It is a plan for nightlife, but the plan will be active 24/7.\"\r  \n\r  \nThe City of Brussels already had a nightlife charter that listed a number of ground rules. Some elements are now added, with an emphasis on preventing \"risk behaviour linked to excessive alcohol and drug use.\" Anyone who wants to run a club or party venue or organise an event in the public space will also have to follow a protocol.\r  \n\r  \nFor example, the security staff of nightclubs must be trained to deal with sexual harassment and other undesirable behaviour. Clubs will have to appoint a confidential advisor to whom potential victims can immediately turn for help, and every club or event venue will also have to provide a \"safe zone\", a place where potential victims can calm down or where people in an \"uncontrollable state of intoxication\" can be escorted until they can safely return home.\r  \n\r  \n\"Anyone who does not follow these measures will not be given a permit or admission,\" said alderman for Culture and Major Events Delphine Houba (PS). \"Those who do not want to cooperate will get into trouble with the municipality,\" says Close. \"There is also a repressive part.\" Establishments that do not want to follow can not only lose their licence, but also risk a fine.\r  \n\r  \n**Huge step forward**\r  \n\n\nHow much budget the action plan will involve is not yet clear. Some efforts will have to be made by the nightclubs themselves, but for the training of the security staff, the offer will come from the City. A public tender has yet to be launched for this. \"It will be a lot of money,\" assures the Mayor.\r  \n\r  \nThe action plan was drawn up in consultation with the nightlife sector, but also after consulting various (feminist) associations active in the field. Ma\u00eft\u00e9 Meeus, the founder of Balance Ton Bar, was also heard. \"Zero risk does not exist, but this is a huge step forward,\" she responds. According to her, the most important elements were included in the action plan. \"They are all measures that can help, but everything depends on implementation.\"\r  \n\r  \nTranslated with www.DeepL.com/Translator (free version)", "created_utc": "1645518492.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hxxxskl", "is_submitter": "True", "link_id": "t3_syif17", "parent_id": "t3_syif17", "score": "11", "subreddit": "belgium", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhe6"}, {"author": "Leiegast", "body": ">but they accept everyone\n\nNot if you have a vagina though", "created_utc": "1645392900.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hxr4cvg", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_swt5si", "parent_id": "t1_hxodikx", "score": "6", "subreddit": "europe", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh4j"}, {"author": "Leiegast", "body": "Yeah the different funding mechanisms can be quite difficult to wrap your head around.", "created_utc": "1645391275.0", "edited": "1645450588.0", "id": "hxr0i78", "is_submitter": "True", "link_id": "t3_sx1r45", "parent_id": "t1_hxq3dg4", "score": "5", "subreddit": "belgium", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhe6"}, {"author": "Leiegast", "body": "Let's see...\n\nSophie Wilm\u00e8s (2019-2020, French speaking liberals): She's now our Foreign Minister\n\nCharles-Louis Michel (2014-2019, French speaking liberals): He's now the president of the European Council and famously wasn't bothered by Von der Leyen's lack of a comfortable chair\n\nElio Di Rupo (2011-2014, French speaking socialists): Currently the First Minister of the Walloon Region\n\nYves Leterme (2008-2008 and 2009-2011, Dutch speaking Christian Democrats): he used to work for a think tank in Stockholm, where was ousted because of his authoritarian style of working.

A separate decree was prepared for Dutch-speaking education in Brussels and the Vlaamse Rand.\r  \n\r  \nThese decrees reiterate a number of general principles, such as the abolition of double quotas and the possibility of working with a 20 per cent priority for under-represented groups.

By 2030-2031, a metro should run from Bordet (Evere) to Albert (Sint-Gillis/Saint-Gilles). Beliris, the federal cooperation agreement between the Brussels Region and the federal government, presented the modified plans at the town hall of Schaarbeek. Symbolically, a new metro station will also be built there.**\n\nThe decision is made. Beliris has submitted the building and environmental application for metro 3. The public enquiry will start in a few weeks.\n\nThese are modified plans that take into account no fewer than 1,200 comments from the impact study completed in July 2021. \"We have integrated most of those comments into the adjusted plans,\" says Beliris CEO C\u00e9dric Bossut.\n\nIt mainly concerns additional measures to promote sustainability: the collection of rainwater and the generation of energy. In addition, more account has been taken of accessibility for people with limited mobility. Finally, consideration was also given to how the metro stations could best be integrated into the public space. To this end, a great deal of consultation has already taken place with the local authorities.\n\nBeliris, the Brussels Region and STIB are aware that the impact of the construction site as well as the final result in the public space will be significant, \"but this must be balanced with the undeniable advantages of this metro,\" said Federal Minister Karine Lalieux (PS) responsible for Beliris at the press conference.\n\nBrieuc De Mee\u00fbs, CEO of MIVB/STIB, once again emphasised the necessity of the new metro line as more and more people are using public transport. \"Our metro and tram lines are becoming saturated,\" he said.\n\n**Tunnel**\n\nThe whole scheme of metro 3 is known. A tunnel will be dug from Bordet, covering a distance of 5 kilometres at a depth of 20 to 30 metres. This tunnel will connect seven new metro stations from Bordet in Evere to the North station. Beliris does this with a tunnel boring machine that immediately digs the tunnel, removes the earth and builds the concrete tube with a diameter of 9 metres. This is done around the clock and seven days a week, at a rate of 15 metres a day. Fast, therefore, and with relatively little impact on the city.\n\nEspecially the construction of the (very deep) stations is quite an undertaking, because they have to be built from the surface. They must also be well integrated into the urban fabric, with metro entrances for large flows of passengers and lifts. Intermodality is also crucial, so that it is possible to switch quickly from the metro to the tram, train, bus or bicycle.\n\nBordet will be the terminus of the new metro line. It will be connected as much as possible to the S-line of the NMBS, the tram and the bus. In the future, the tram to Zaventem airport will also be added. The station will be built under the existing train station. Beliris expects that this will generate an additional 2,500 pedestrians who will then continue their journey by bike, car or public transport.\n\nA little further on, Beliris is building a brand new depot for the new metro vehicles on the MIVB/STIB site.\n\nThe Vrede station will be located on the Vredeplein, where the Evere music academy is located. Beliris wants to breathe new life into commerce with the new metro station. The station will have an extensive green roof and photovoltaic panels.\n\nFive hundred metres further on, in Frans Verdonckstraat, where there are vegetable gardens today, the Linde station will be built. Beliris designed a station in the form of a large greenhouse, which refers to Evere's agricultural past.\n\nThe Riga station in Schaarbeek has been the subject of much grumbling in the past because it would spoil the historic character of the Rigasquare. Beliris has a new design in which the metro access lies deeper so that the visual disruption is limited. The station will be behind Helmet Church and is an extra asset for trade on Helmesteenweg. There will be a bicycle parking area in the station for 90 bicycles and delivery tricycles. Remarkable trees that have to make way for the station will be moved.\n\nThe Verboekhoven station will have the greatest impact on the neighbourhood because it will be built partly in an inner block. A bridge must also be built to connect the station to the Voltairelaan. The station will be built on the site of the Lidl in Waelhemstraat. This will be demolished. The metro station has a mutilmodal connection with the nearby Verboekhovenplein (tram 92, bus 59) and also ends at the Lambermontlaan, where it connects with tram 7. Remarkable: there, the ground floor of two neoclassical town houses will be transformed into an entrance to the metro station. If that fails, new housing will be built there. The green space around the station will not be accessible to the public, so that local residents will not be inconvenienced.\n\nAnd then there is Collignon, a metro station in front of Schaarbeek's town hall. This historic square will have to be completely redesigned after the construction of the station. The square will be car-free and will be re-greened with a double row of trees to provide a symmetrical view of the listed town hall. The metro line will connect with tram 92.The last new station to be built is that of Liedts. The underground technical installation of Sibelga has already been moved there to make room for the new metro station. Liedts is now an intermodal hub with trams 25, 62 and 93. It is also a busy square. Beliris will take the opportunity to improve this square, which today looks chaotic. The metro entrances will be central with an above-ground public meeting space connected to them.\n\n**Will the metro run in 2031?**\n\nAll this is not for tomorrow. Building a station easily takes two years, digging the metro tunnel three years. A test period of 18 months is needed before the metro can actually run. The building permit still has to be issued, and the public tenders still have to be launched. C\u00e9dric Bossut (Beliris) is therefore aiming for 2030-2031. In 2012, Bruzz reported that the metro would start running in 2023. So the construction has been delayed considerably anyway.And then there is the financing. The North Bordet section is estimated at EUR 1.5 billion. The conversion of the pre-metro from North to Albert is estimated at another 600 million. New metro trains will also have to be purchased (EUR 200 million). In total, that is easily 2.3 billion euros.\n\n**Budget**\n\nFinance Minister Sven Gatz (Open VLD) warned some time ago that these amounts cannot be kept out of the budget forever. He made the proposal to spend the full Beliris amount (125 million euros per year) on the metro from 2024. \"And even then we will not get there,\" he said then.\n\nBoth federal minister for Beliris Karine Lalieux (PS) and Brussels mobility minister Elke Van Den Brandt (Groen) did not deny that the investments for the metro cut heavily into public finances but did not want to respond at the press conference to Gatz's proposal to spend the full Beliris money on the metro. \"\n\nBeliris is a project of the federal government and the Brussels Region. In 2024, they will look together at which projects Beliris will invest in. But metro 3 will be financed,\" Lalieux said.\n\nTranslated with [www.DeepL.com/Translator](http://www.DeepL.com/Translator) (free version)", "created_utc": "1645031561.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hx71ku5", "is_submitter": "True", "link_id": "t3_su0yk4", "parent_id": "t3_su0yk4", "score": "6", "subreddit": "belgium", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhe6"}, {"author": "Leiegast", "body": "First of all, Thibaut Courtois was born and raised in Limburg, which is in Flanders.\n\nSecond of all, the north and south of Belgium have been together for quite a long time, and mentality, architecture, food etc. reflect this.

It's not rumours and gossip,\" he insists. The assaults in question vary from inappropriate jokes about the dress of female colleagues or students, to hands on the buttocks, sexual advances and even physical assaults (beatings, forced embraces, etc.). An attempted rape was even reported.\n\nBlatant impunity\n\nWhat alarms the IPCC member is the blatant lack of reaction from the university authorities, who are generally aware of the facts. \"The victims were gagged in at least three cases,\" he explains. \"There are never any sanctions worthy of the name.

In the joint committee on State Reform of the Chamber and Senate, he argued on Friday in favour of stronger cooperation between Brussels and Flanders.\n\nA fortnight ago, the French-speaking professors of constitutional law, Marc Verdussen (UCLouvain) and Marc Uyttendaele (ULB), advocated a federalism with four entities - Flanders, Wallonia, Brussels and the German-speaking Community - that would replace the current two-tier model, built on the Regions and Communities.\n\nMaddens pointed out that Belgium's institutional structure is based on duality. \"It is unclear how the division into four states would be extended to the federal level. Would the Chamber and Senate then be divided into four federated entities, instead of two language groups? Would a majority be required in each state group to pass special laws? Would a four-part parity be introduced for the federal government?\", he wondered.\n\nMore cooperation between Brussels and Flanders\n\nA four-party state model is only a simplification if all community competences in Brussels are transferred to the Brussels Region. But most advocates of this model want to leave Flanders competent for at least education and culture in Brussels, and in Bart Maddens' view that presupposes a new vehicle to make this possible.\n\nMoreover, it is difficult to justify in democratic terms that the German-speaking Community, with barely 0.67% of the Belgian population, should be placed institutionally on the same level as Flanders and Wallonia.\n\nMaddens argues in favour of strengthening the cooperation between Brussels and Flanders. For example, one or two Flemish ministers could be part of the Brussels government for the community competences, while the six Brussels elected members in the Flemish Parliament could be added to the Flemish Community Commission (VGC).\n\nTranslated with www.DeepL.com/Translator (free version)", "created_utc": "1644605554.0", "edited": "1644606025.0", "id": "hwjg7b2", "is_submitter": "True", "link_id": "t3_sq6kn6", "parent_id": "t3_sq6kn6", "score": "5", "subreddit": "belgium", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhe6"}, {"author": "Leiegast", "body": "I think you are talking about East Turkestan", "created_utc": "1644569662.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hwhf1un", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_spjskf", "parent_id": "t1_hwh3mc6", "score": "19", "subreddit": "europe", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh4j"}, {"author": "Leiegast", "body": "Dan moet het wel h\u00e9\u00e9l erg gesteld zijn met de radio daar", "created_utc": "1644533872.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hwfijck", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_soq4dp", "parent_id": "t1_hwc5gdu", "score": "1", "subreddit": "belgium", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhe6"}, {"author": "Leiegast", "body": "De Spaanse radiozenders zijn ook in hetzelfde bedje ziek.

That's a ratio of almost 2 to 5.\n\nThese ratios are very different and as such lead to different dynamics within these language areas.\n\n>I worked in Flanders without speaking Flemish, because everyone was just using English anyway.\n\nThat might be true for some jobs and some instances, but for others, knowing Dutch is an invualable asset, if not a prerequisite.\n\n>France has laws that ensure French media gets a big part of air time, to give an example of effort to preserve the language.\n\nThere are quota for Dutch language music in Flanders as well, and I assume that is also the case in the Netherlands.\n\nFurthermore, quota are a very top-down approach and aren't always the best solution. What I think has proven to be a lot more effective, is the tax shelter for audiovisual works and the ['Vlaams Audiovisueel Fonds'](https://www.vaf.be/en) handing out subsidies for productions shot in Flanders.\n\n>Belgian French media seems rare because most of it is done basically conjointly with France (just note that we talk about \"BD franco-belge\", never \"BD fran\u00e7aise\").\n\nThat's a very generous interpretation of the situation. I'd say that French media from France mostly see Belgium (and Switzerland) as places that can push up their viewership figures by a few percentage points, so that's why they'll add like a token Belgian in their shows, quizzes etc. I'd hardly call that an equal relationship.\n\n>French-speaking pupils in Dutch schools is an interesting phenomenon. Sure, learning Dutch is a very big plus, but also is the fact that Flemish education is just better overall.\n\nIt's a combination of factors IMO. Flemish education in general is seen as more effective compared to French speaking schools. However, there's also the fact that less than 10% of pupils who graduate from French speaking schools in Brussels say they are able to hold a conversation in Dutch. Those are appalling numbers in a supposedly bilingual region.\n\n>Also important to realize what a big concentration of French-speakers in Flemish schools could do to the internal culture of the school. Again, potential permeation problem.\n\nThat's why the Flemish government is investing heavily in these schools and why Flemish schools have to maintain more or less strict language policies in order to ensure that Dutch is being taught well.", "created_utc": "1644341880.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hw3w0cz", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_snh4we", "parent_id": "t1_hw3236i", "score": "6", "subreddit": "belgium", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhe6"}, {"author": "Leiegast", "body": "This is a very \"francophone\" view of the situation. French speaking media, especially in France, are obsessed with the supposed decline of French in favour of English and French speakers then project this view onto smaller languages: \"If French is under threat from English, then surely it's even worse for smaller languages!\"\n\n>I don't mean to be disrespectful, and I know it's easy to say as a French native, but I think at this point Dutch speakers have to accept the fact that their language is slowly dying.\n\nDutch is NOT dying out. The only place where English has come to dominate over Dutch is in high-level academia and some locations with a high expat concentration in the Netherlands. This needn't be a problem. In the past, Latin was used as a bridge language for scholars and the aristocracy throughout Europe during the Middle Ages and French later took up that mantle among the aristocracy and the bourgeoisie, and German used to be an important scientific language. Latin and French didn't end up replacing the local languages in other countries (Brussels is an exception and many other factors were at play there).\n\n>The reality is that there is little to no incentive to learn Dutch except if you're going to actually live in Flanders or the Netherlands.\n\nWell, if you're living in Brussels and you're trying to find a job in Flanders, where there are a lot more jobs you know, then knowing Dutch is absolutely fucking useful. It's simple economics.\n\nThere's a reason that an increasing number of French speaking parents and those that speak other languages at home, are putting their children in Dutch language schools in Brussels. They recognize that knowledge of Dutch, besides French and English, will be an invaluable asset for their children.\n\n>And let's be honest: Dutch/Flemish culture exportation is virtually non-existent.\n\nI don't know if you realize it, but French language culture exports have become pretty much non-existent as well outside of traditionally francophone countries.\n\n>There also seems to be very little effort made to actively protect the language within the country.\n\nWell that flies in the face of N-VA's and Vlaams Belang's entire existence.\n\nThere's also a very strong undercurrent in Dutch (and Flemish) society that forces foreigners to learn Dutch if they want to become part of the community. Dutch people (and Flemings) might easily switch to English if they are talking to foreigners, but they will also keep talking Dutch in their own social circles. This social dynamic ensures that foreigners who don't speak Dutch will never be part of the in-group.\n\n>France has done a lot to preserve the French language and culture, and it seems the Dutch-speaking world hasn't really done the same\n\nWhat has France exactly done in order to \"preserve French language and culture\"? French people are still doing \"du jogging\", going \"au pressing\" and using their \"smartphone\", much at the dismay of l'Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise.\n\n>French natives have multiple words to refer to the French-speaking world (\"francophonie\", \"francosph\u00e8re\", etc)\n\nYes, we call it \"het Nederlandse taalgebied\", English speakers call it the \"anglosphere\", Spanish speakers \"la hispanidad\", and German speakers \"der deutsche Sprachraum\". There's nothing special about that concept. The only difference is that French speakers are a lot more bombastic and/or sentimental about it.\n\n>but do Dutch speakers around the world even share a big, common culture like we French speakers do?\n\nDo French speakers in the DRC, Canada, Belgium and Mali really share a common culture? I highly doubt it. Flemings and Dutchmen are much more culturally similar than Walloons and Senegalese.\n\n>French has a world-renowned dubbing industry, while Dutch speakers subtitle everything.\n\nThe only thing dubbing achieves is that it makes it harder for francophones to learn other languages.\n\nSubtitling also doesn't prevent us from producing our own language content. In fact, there's a lot more Flemish audiovisual media out there (films, series, etc.) than Belgian French media.\n\n>Hell, Flemings even subtitle Dutch programs!\n\nFlemish media have a much more liberal subtitling policy because we are used to it. That doesn't mean that we don't understand regular Dutch from the Netherlands, otherwise Dutch-Flemish coproductions like Temptation Island, Big Brother, Undercover, Als de dijken breken etc. would be unfeasable.\n\n>Again, I don't mean to be rude\n\nYou're not rude. You mostly come off as ignorant.\n\n>but is there really that much Dutch culture can do to compete with (obviously) the English megagiant, but even more locally with French cinema, literature, comic-books, or music?\n\nThere is A LOT of Flemish and Dutch media content out there.\n\n>And if we're talking about Brussels, honestly I'm kinda wondering whether immigrated Frenchmen don't actually outnumber Flemings. That's the state we're in.\n\nThere are a lot of French people in Brussels, true. But those French people will either move back to France or integrate into the local francophone population.

What has just happened in Ottignies-Louvain-la-Neuve is a perfect illustration. While a municipal council is convened on Friday to vote on the motion of no confidence in the college, the current Ecolo/Avenir (cdH)/PS majority has sealed its reconciliation. The information revealed by RTBF on Wednesday was confirmed during a press conference organised at the end of the afternoon.\n\nDuring the local council meeting this Friday, the Avenir and PS members will vote against the motion of no confidence that they signed and filed with the OLLN 2.0 list (MR). The text will then be rejected and the majority will remain in place.\n\n**Were the disagreements worth a divorce?**\n\nA fortnight ago, it was the scenario of a reversal of alliance that was emerging. Avenir and PS announced the signature of a new majority pact with OLLN 2.0 and the return of Ecolo to the opposition. However, doubts gradually crept into the minds of certain representatives, fuelled in particular by a citizens' petition denouncing a coup de force (1335 signatures to date). Were the disagreements with Ecolo really worth such a crisis?\n\nIn fact, the thread has never been completely broken within the current majority, despite appearances. A first round of secret negotiations took place shortly after the announcement of the break-up to try to pick up the pieces. Further discussions were needed in recent days to iron out the differences and finally find common ground.\n\n**A better project for citizens?**\n\nIn a very uncomfortable position, Avenir and the PS have undertaken to explain their backtracking. They regret having rushed into a reversal of alliance a fortnight ago. They also expect that their attitude will not be understood by everyone. But they assume their reversal. According to them, the electroshock they provoked allowed the current majority to meet again, to say everything and to start again on new bases, \"with a better project for the citizens\".\n\nIn concrete terms, Ecolo, Avenir and PS agreed to move forward more quickly on a series of issues considered to be priorities: redevelopment of the centre of Ottignies, location of the future public nursing home, creation of a public school in the future Ath\u00e9na-Lauzelle district, restoration of the tranquillity around the Source Park in Louvain-la-Neuve, in particular. Everything that the OLLN 2.0 list had also promised to do a fortnight ago.\n\nAs a token of restored confidence, Ecolo has also agreed to hand over the competence for finance to the Avenir group. This portfolio, held until now by alderman Philippe Delvaux, has previously created some tension. The tax system will undoubtedly be reviewed and corrected, but all this will be done collectively. The functioning of the college will also be adapted for more efficiency.\n\n**Time has run out for the Liberals**\n\nFor the OLLN 2.0 list, this was a cruel disappointment. Believing that its time had come, it did not sense, or too late, that the wind was changing as the vote on the motion approached. Was she naive? Overconfidence? The time that has elapsed since the announcement of the signing of a new majority pact a fortnight ago has worked against the Liberals.\n\nOn Twitter, MR president Georges-Louis Bouchez quoted Moli\u00e8re: \"Hypocrisy is a fashionable vice and all fashionable vices are considered virtues\", with a murderous comment: \"Ecolo, politics otherwise... worse. Positions and salaries at the expense of Ottignies Louvain-la-Neuve. Congratulations to the local MR for its sense of responsibility and dignity.\n\nOne thing is certain, the affair will not leave a good impression. First of all, with the voters, whether they welcomed the announcement of a change of majority or denounced it, confidence is likely to be altered by these events. Relations between the political groups will also undoubtedly suffer, including within the majority, which nevertheless insists on its desire to move forward in a once again serene climate.\n\nTranslated with www.DeepL.com/Translator (free version)", "created_utc": "1643834048.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hvbofaw", "is_submitter": "True", "link_id": "t3_siz0ia", "parent_id": "t3_siz0ia", "score": "6", "subreddit": "belgium", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhe6"}, {"author": "Leiegast", "body": "TLDR: Most income streams for the Flemish government are indexed regularly, whereas its expenditures either follow the health index ~~(which doesn't include energy prices!)~~, are indexed differently or not at all.\n\nThis means that the Flemish government stands to receive \u20ac1.5 billion more this year than it had anticipated when it prepared the budget.

The question arises because Dedye, who was in charge of donations at the Pepinster railway station, has admitted to having diverted 500 kg of coal intended for flood victims to his parents-in-law.\n\nThe mayor, Philippe Godin, revealed the facts on Monday evening. Claude Dedye admits it: \"I asked to deliver a big bag of coal to someone close to me (...) Yes, very clearly: the parents of my girlfriend.\n\nIndignation from the mayor: \"It's scandalous! Elected people should set an example! But here, they are helping themselves (to donations). There has been a misappropriation.\n\n\"I'm sorry,\" Claude Dedye retorted. \"It was probably not the most appropriate way to donate the coal. I deeply regret it. I shouldn't have done that...\" His in-laws are in need, he swears again. That's why he would have had the coal delivered to the needy.\n\n\"That's not an explanation,\" retorts Philippe Godin. These donations were supposed to go to the disaster victims! And he repeats: this is \"a misappropriation\".\n\nClaude Dedye and Julie Beckers have now been summoned to appear before the PS vigilance commission. They both risk exclusion from the party; and according to our information (collected \"from a good source\", as they say), there is little doubt that Claude Dedye will be excluded...

This, by design, makes it so that all newcomers, from outside the EU & EEA have to reach the same goals. I don't think it would be legally possible, and even desirable, to differentiate between people from different countries. What kind of message would we be sending if we said: \"Well, you're from a poor third-world country, so you only have to reach this level, whereas you are from a rich, developed country, so we expect you to at least reach this level.\"\nDont forget that we are taking in both the highly-educated and the lowly-educated and illiterate.

This is a family of Latin-American heritage in West-Flanders, exactly who they're saying they want to bring in?\n\nIt's interesting that you raise this particular situation. I happen to have a friend from a mixed background (Guatemalan mum & Flemish dad) who grew up in Evergem. She hasn't really experienced racism because she has a very Flemish first and last name and she doesn't look very Latino. However, a cousin of her who has the same mixed background (it's an interesting situation: two Guatemalan sisters married two Flemish brothers) looks more Latino and as such he has experienced racist incidents, with her present, while she did not. This is of course not acceptable. On the whole, however, they are still very happy in Belgium and they recognise that they would not have had the same opportunities had they grown up in Guatemala. This is of course anecdotal evidence, but it's a reaction to your story about Tine Mortier.\n\nAlso, it's not like the place Tine Mortier and her family are moving to, Costa Rica, doesn't have a history of systemic racism. In fact, Central America has deep issues with it that stem from colonial times. The whiter you look, the easier life will be, whereas native-looking people are being set back.

And that is necessary if our companies want to continue to grow and ensure well-being and prosperity.\"** \r  \n\r  \nIt may sound like a broken record, but the Chamber of Commerce Voka has constantly been raising the issue of a tight labour market for years. Despite corona, things are going from bad to worse, especially in West Flanders. \"We see that in November last year in our province the number of non-working jobseekers per vacancy was 1 to 1,\" says Hans Boels, chairman Voka region South-West Flanders. \"That means that for some jobs there are no candidates left, which means that West Flanders is in a very unique situation.\"\r  \n\r  \n**No reserve**\r  \nThe job-seeker ratio, which is the ratio of the number of job-seekers to the population of working age, was 4.7 per cent in West Flanders at the end of November 2021 compared with 5.7 per cent in Flanders. \"Regions such as Tielt and Diksmuide, with 3.2 percent, come close to 3 percent, which is considered full employment,\" says Michel Soubry, chairman Voka region Central West Flanders.\"\r  \n\r  \n\"But in order to grow we need people,\" says Hans Boels.  \"That is where the shoe pinches seriously. The shortage does not seem to be easing; on the contrary, the tension on the labour market has never been as great as it is now. There is no reserve left in our province. We need at least 77,000 extra workers to continue to guarantee the growth of our companies. We need initiatives to support the labour market. Focusing on activation and staying in work for longer, qualitatively, is not enough.\"\r  \n\r  \nTo tackle the problem, Voka foresees a number of measures. \"We need a modern and flexible labour law and by means of training and guidance we can activate at least 15,000 job seekers and give at least 12,000 inactive people a job,\" clarifies Christophe Dhaene, president of Voka Ieper.\r  \n\r  \n**Poland**\r  \nIn addition, according to Voka, we should dare to focus on a more targeted economic labour migration, both of highly, medium and low-skilled people. We should not only look for them within Europe, but also outside of it. \"During a certain period many Poles came to work here,\" says Hans Boels, chairman of Voka region Central West Flanders. \"In the meantime, the standard of living in that country has risen and they themselves are struggling with shortages on the labour market. Hungarians and Bulgarians took their place, but due to corona that influx has come to a standstill. Moreover, those people do not stay here. Their families stay in the country of origin and sooner or later the workers go home again.\" \r  \n\r  \n\r  \n**Entire families**\n\nVoka really wants to make an effort to bring over entire families. \"In South America there is a great potential of people looking for work. We also want to bring over workers from the Philippines and Africa.\" One example is a project in Nigeria and Senegal that seeks to give highly educated people from those countries suitable jobs in Flanders. \"We hope to welcome 50,000 foreign talents in the coming years to strengthen our economy.

In December, the Brussels Minister in charge of this policy, Alain Maron (Ecolo), said that the courses would only start on 1 April 2022 instead of 1 January. He is now repeating that date at BRUZZ.\r  \n\r  \nFlemish MP Annabel Tavernier (N-VA) is worried that there might still be a delay. In order to roll out the programmes in Brussels, personal data must be able to be exchanged between the language communities. The technical tool for that data exchange is not yet ready in Brussels. Furthermore, this exchange of data requires a proper legal framework. The Flemish Government will approve an extra article in the original cooperation agreement this Friday. The GGC also still has to do so.\r  \n\r  \n\"There will be more advisory councils, which will soon take a few weeks. I simply do not believe that this tool will be operational by April. We have to be legally in order,\" Tavernier says.\r  \n\r  \n**4,000 routes**\r  \nAccording to Flemish Minister of Integration and Citizenship Bart Somers (Open VLD) there indeed still needs to be consultation between the GGC, Cocof and the Flemish Community. \"It is up to the GGC to take this initiative. Until now it hasn't happened,\" Somers said Tuesday, in response to a parliamentary question by Tavernier. By the way, the last steering committee dates from September 9.\r  \n\r  \n\"Flanders is ready to set up the 4,000 civic integration courses planned in Brussels,\" Somers added. This concerns 4,000 places in the Bon welcome office, financed by Flanders. \"The GGC is responsible for the further operationalisation and communication about this. Of course I would have much preferred to keep the starting date of 1 January and my cabinet has also explicitly said so.\"\r  \n\r  \nAlain Maron let it be known that the united college of the GGC had already approved the new legislation at first reading on 16 December. \"I confirm that the civic integration will be in force on 1 April,\" his spokesman responds.\r  \n\r  \n\"My wish is an approach to the reception of newcomers that is as inclusive as possible, both for the people who are subject to the obligation and for those who want to follow the reception programme on a voluntary basis,\" Maron said. For this purpose, the Brussels Minister is setting aside 1.185 million euros this year.\r  \n\r  \nTranslated with www.DeepL.com/Translator (free version)", "created_utc": "1642069738.0", "edited": "1642076231.0", "id": "hsgz1c6", "is_submitter": "True", "link_id": "t3_s2webq", "parent_id": "t3_s2webq", "score": "3", "subreddit": "belgium", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhe6"}, {"author": "Leiegast", "body": "Uhm, I'm from Belgium, which traditionally is a Catholic country, and you can definitely leave the Church.

This announcement follows the painful adoption of his decree for \"a fairer tax\" and the strong tensions between the minister and his party president, Georges-Louis Bouchez.**\n\nThis Monday morning, the Walloon Minister of Budget, Jean-Luc Crucke (MR) invited the press at the last minute. Officially, the Walloon Budget Minister proposed to the journalists to \"take stock of the work of the last weeks\".\n\nThe minister quickly announced that he was leaving the Walloon government and that he had informed his teams and Elio Di Rupo this Monday morning.\n\n\"The political tension with the \"fairer tax\" decree led me to a simple conclusion. My liberal convictions are no longer in line with my party line. This is a reality, not a regret. I have always had opinions, described by some as \"on the fringes\" at the level of my party, particularly on climate, migration and now tax issues... The November-December episode showed that we were no longer talking about the substance\", explained Jean-Luc Crucke at the beginning of the press conference. The November-December episode showed that we were no longer talking about the substance\", explained Jean-Luc Crucke at the beginning of the press conference. I saw Georges-Louis on Thursday at my home. We discussed very frankly, calmly and in a good mood. I made my decision alone without any external pressure.\n\n**High tensions**\n\nAs a reminder, it was the vote on the decree for \"a fairer tax\", prepared by Jean-Luc Crucke, which led the Walloon government and the MR into an internal crisis at the beginning of December.\n\nJean-Luc Crucke, who wanted to have his decree adopted under the PS-MR-Ecolo majority agreement, was dropped by his own party's parliamentarians who pointed out the legal fragility of the text and considered that it attacked the middle class too much.\n\n\"He added that \"he will know how to draw the consequences when the time comes\".\n\nThe \"frondeurs\" MR MPs were supported by their president, Georges-Louis Bouchez. \"We must stop considering that parliamentarians are the press-buttons of texts that come from the government,\" Georges-Louis Bouchez stressed, even describing them as \"irreproachable in this matter\".\n\nA crisis that brought to light the bad relations between the MR president and the Walloon Minister of Finance.\n\nBut after five days of turmoil and contacts, the draft decree was finally returned to the parliament, where it was approved, including by the liberal parliamentarians \"in the name of government stability\".\n\n**Constitutional Court**\n\nBehind the scenes, a scenario had been recurring for several weeks. That of an appointment of Jean-Luc Crucke to the Constitutional Court. This month, the Mouvement R\u00e9formateur must appoint its representative in this high court. And as we revealed to you, Georges-Louis Bouchez wanted to send a tenor from Hainaut. A way for the president to get rid of two \"cumbersome\" elected officials, both from a personal and local point of view.\n\n\"Georges-Louis wants to clean up Hainaut, he doesn't want Crucke, Marghem or Denis Ducarme on the federal list for Hainaut, so he is manoeuvring in this direction\", a well-informed source told us.\n\nA scenario that has been confirmed. \"Georges-Louis has once again proposed me to be the MR candidate for the Constitutional Court,\" explained Jean-Luc Crucke. \"This time I accepted. This position has always tempted me. I had already talked about it with him in 2019. But my ministerial mandate meant that this possibility was not available. I am sure that I will be able to play a suitable role in the service of democracy. I have many other plans, such as teaching, writing and walking across Iran. The future looks exciting.\n\n\"It was important for the Mouvement R\u00e9formateur to have a quality candidate for the Constitutional Court\", commented Georges-Louis Bouchez.\n\n**Who will replace Jean-Luc Crucke?**\n\nBehind the scenes, several names are being mentioned to replace Jean-Luc Crucke, some of them insistently, such as Philippe Goffin or Maxime Daye, the current MR mayor of Braine-le-Comte.\n\nBut to know who will be the new minister, we will have to wait. It is only on Tuesday that Georges-Louis Bouchez will reveal the choice of the MR to replace Jean-Luc Crucke in the Walloon government. \"We will organise a press conference on Tuesday morning to present the person who will succeed him and who will take office after the government meeting on Thursday\", said Georges-Louis Bouchez.\n\nTranslated with [www.DeepL.com/Translator](http://www.DeepL.com/Translator) (free version)", "created_utc": "1641812265.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hs1r3uw", "is_submitter": "True", "link_id": "t3_s0he7h", "parent_id": "t3_s0he7h", "score": "9", "subreddit": "belgium", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhe6"}, {"author": "Leiegast", "body": ">You can even forget about cheap ~~water~~ in Switzerland", "created_utc": "1641759807.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hryl3rj", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_rzqy2x", "parent_id": "t1_hryik2h", "score": "49", "subreddit": "belgium", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhe6"}, {"author": "Leiegast", "body": "Ja, sommige mensen blijken wel eens een kort geheugen te hebben.\n\nIn de jaren 80 zwaaide het FDF de plak in heel wat Brusselse gemeenten, wat toen wel degelijk een racistische partij was met figuren als Roger Nols, burgemeester van Schaarbeek, die ooit eens rondreed op een kameel verkleed als een Bedoe\u00efen om de mensen te tonen wat er zou gebeuren als de migranten stemrecht kregen.\n\nIn de jaren 90 had je de steile opmars van het Vlaams Blok in het Antwerpse, die een symptoom was van het groeiend ongenoegen over de migranten daar.\n\nEn in 2018 had je de hoge scores van Vlaams Belang in de Denderstreek, nadat er de laatste 10 jaar een opmerkelijke toename is van vooral zwarte Brusselaars.\n\nNu was ik verbaasd over het grote verschil tussen Langemark-Poelkapelle en andere gemeenten van de Westhoek en lo and behold, er is daar een asielcentrum gevestigd.", "created_utc": "1641667618.0", "edited": "1641732784.0", "id": "hrt4rdy", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_rz0j1s", "parent_id": "t1_hrsgnsu", "score": "2", "subreddit": "belgium", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhe6"}, {"author": "Leiegast", "body": "Lucifer is Latin for 'he who carries light' or 'lightbringer', if you will", "created_utc": "1641589127.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hrosqxd", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_rxq7gu", "parent_id": "t1_hrod2dg", "score": "2", "subreddit": "belgium", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhe6"}, {"author": "Leiegast", "body": "Stupid sexy Lidje", "created_utc": "1641588726.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hrornym", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_rxq7gu", "parent_id": "t1_hrmdfkk", "score": "3", "subreddit": "belgium", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhe6"}, {"author": "Leiegast", "body": "Ik omschrijf mezelf nog altijd als blank.
