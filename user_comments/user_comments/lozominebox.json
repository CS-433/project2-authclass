I eventually beat it and then immediately got trounced by he next boss and went \"yeah nah not for me\". A few years pass, one of my friends gets really into bloodborne to the point where he even platinumed the game, and went through (most of) the other modern Fromsoft library. That combined with the hype of Elden Ring finally inspired me to try it again and I'm glad I did. Took a bit of a mindset shift - I'm not used to just running past enemies that I don't need to fight, and I also had played Metroid Fusion between now and then so I was more open to exploration and getting lost than I was prior. The game isn't the painful slog that I had expected. I actually managed to beat a few bosses first try: >!Gascoigne (not including attempts from years prior), Witch of Hemwick, Shadows of Yharnam!< and the other bosses I've found to be quite reasonable.

I studied French all throughout high school and after those 6 years my French is at about upper B1, which isn't quite fluent. I was a good student, literally top of my class of 8 people, and did slightly above average for the state (and due to how scores are adjusted across subjects, if everyone took French I would've been in the top 5%). So, my brain works pretty well, but if I'm not fluent after 6 years of classes, the issue lies with how languages are taught in school right?\n\nWell, yes and no.\n\nYes in that at my high school for the first 2 years, we would only have 3 classes a fortnight, which increased to 3 classes a week during my third year. During this time we learned simple things like clothes, the weather, colours, \u00eatre conjugations, pass\u00e9 compos\u00e9 etc. A more disciplined learner could probably do in 3 months what took us 3 years. For the remaining 3 years it improved as we covered a wider variety of content, more cultural stuff with French explanations, and were given actual native French content for listening practice (though we were assessed on easier material). So content wise the first 3 years were somewhat wasteful.\n\nHowever, it's also my own fault for believing that all I needed for fluency was a high school class. I was unaware of just how large languages are and I didn't make much effort outside of class except for the set homework. However, my sister managed to teach herself Spanish and in 2 years her Spanish ability was comparable to that of my French (and is likely far greater now). Also, I've finished one semester of Japanese at uni (which covered the first 6 chapters of Genki) and were it not for weekly quizzes with deadlines I don't think that I would have managed to get over the initial hurdle, and would not have managed to study for 6 months straight. \n\nI'm gonna guess that a lot of the bashing mostly comes from people who didn't have a great experience in high school, and while there certainly is room for improvement, it's kinda silly to generalise all language classes as being without merit.
