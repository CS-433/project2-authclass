I find this easiest to do with single sims though since you spend all of the day doing the actual job and only your off days really to focus on the rest of the family, although you also have the option of just having them go to work like normal once you reach a high level or don't want to do it anymore.\n\nUniversity also offers new careers and lets you also start higher up in already there careers. I like playing through university and how you can choose how much or little workload you take each semester so you can \"get it over with\" quickly or really play it out and use Uni as a way to build up relationships. It also builds up skills which is handy. The new careers, Law, Education and Engineering also offer work from home  options which I really like. Good for family sims who want to stay in and take care of the kids. \n\nIf you are really into the family dynamic and legacy playstyles then Parenthood is really great. It offers a lot in terms of parenting and new behavioral \"skills\" that follow them to adulthood like manners and responsibility. You work on those skills from toddler through teen so plenty of time to hone them out and I love the phases the kids go through! You can also discipline them and choose a strict or a more soft approach which can change the relationship you have with your parents when you grow up so instead of parent you can also get \"mommy dearest\" if the relationship is good and discipline not too strict.

You seem to have a lot of great things covered so props! \n\n \nFirst of all, your hotel/hostel should have a free copy of a newspaper called Grapevine which is a great place to find all things touristy. It's all in english and has pages dedicated to food, drinks, museums, movies and music so you can see what is on for the days you are here as well as basic about the restaurants to try out. \nThey also have a [website](http://grapevine.is/)\n\n\nMy personal recommendation would be Kex Hostel, a very social hostel in downtown reykjav\u00edk and they often have live music/events in their common area and they have a nice pub as well as just great atmosphere and of course, other tourists plus locals to socialize with!  Their website is http://www.kexhostel.is/ and they should also be on FB where you can see what they have going! \n\n\nDen Danske Kro or the danish pub is a nice little pub which often has a troubadour playing if you're into that, also an active part of the nightlife if you go on a weekend! \n\n\nYou mentioned Airwaves but check out all the off venues for the rest of the days as well if you are in town. The town will be packed and it's just an amazing event. Look out for happy hour specials as well, Grapevine should have a list. \n\n\nBreakfast, I like [Laundromat Cafe](http://www.thelaundromatcafe.com/) although I think it's originally danish but they have a great breakfast menu mon-fri as well as a weekend brunch menu. \n\n\n[Cafe Loki](http://loki.is/) is a great place for some local cuisine, they can be a bit pricey though but they have some icelandic classics like rye bread and fish stew, schnapps, rye bread and shark :P also something every icelandic person will eat during winter lamb soup filled with veggies, lamb and rice. Its delicious! \nThey also have a breakfast special to 11:30\n\n\nHope this helps, sorry it's so long! \n", "created_utc": "1477876549.0", "edited": "False", "id": "d9eqfdy", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_5a7dii", "parent_id": "t3_5a7dii", "score": "2", "subreddit": "VisitingIceland", "subreddit_id": "t5_2wgkr"}, {"author": "nymmyy", "body": "if you have some basics in those languages then sure, shouldn't be as hard  :) why not?
