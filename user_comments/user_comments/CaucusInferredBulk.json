Physicists use the Boltzmann brain thought experiment as a reductio ad absurdum argument for evaluating competing scientific theories.\n\nIn contrast to brain in a vat thought experiments which are about perception and thought, Boltzmann Brains are used in cosmology to test our assumptions about thermodynamics and the development of the universe. Over a sufficiently long time, random fluctuations could cause particles to spontaneously form literally any structure of any degree of complexity, including a functioning human brain. In this thought experiment, a Boltzmann brain is a fully formed brain, complete with memories of a full human life, that arises out of thermodynamic equilibrium. The scenario initially involved only a single brain with false memories, but physicist Sean Carroll pointed out that entire bodies, even entire worlds and solar systems are more likely to be Boltzmann entities in a randomly fluctuating universe.[1][2]\n\nThe idea is named after the Austrian physicist Ludwig Boltzmann (1844\u20131906), who, in 1896, published a theory that tried to account for the fact that the universe is not as chaotic as the budding field of thermodynamics seemed to predict. He offered several explanations, one of them being that the universe, even after it had progressed to its most likely spread-out and featureless state (or at thermal equilibrium), would spontaneously fluctuate to a more ordered (or low-entropy) state such as the universe in which we find ourselves. Boltzmann brains were first proposed as a reductio ad absurdum response to this explanation by Boltzmann for the low-entropy state of our universe.[3]\n\nThe Boltzmann brain gained new relevance around 2002, when some cosmologists started to become concerned that, in many theories about the Universe, human brains are vastly more likely to arise from random fluctuations; this leads to the conclusion that, statistically, humans are likely to be wrong about their memories of the past and in fact be Boltzmann brains.[4][5] When applied to more recent theories about the multiverse, Boltzmann brain arguments are part of the unsolved measure problem of cosmology.", "created_utc": "1662671672.0", "edited": "False", "id": "inn481z", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_x98z2s", "parent_id": "t1_inmlr3t", "score": "14", "subreddit": "WritingPrompts", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s3nb"}, {"author": "CaucusInferredBulk", "body": "You know its important if its worth turning away from the view of Leia.", "created_utc": "1662669945.0", "edited": "False", "id": "inmzp90", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_x93q01", "parent_id": "t3_x93q01", "score": "6", "subreddit": "StarWars", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qi4s"}, {"author": "CaucusInferredBulk", "body": "Start with the CRKT Nathan's Knife.

Both courses are very similar, and excellent. LT is free. But for most languages MT has more content.  \n\nLong version : \n\nFrom a mechanics standpoint, the two methods are almost identical. Teacher asks question. pause. you answer. unpause. student answers. teacher corrects. Both ignore the \"traditional\" approach of giving you a table of a verb type to learn all the conjugations of. You instead get random-feeling slices of grammar that you can start to use immediately, with more overlapping slices added over time, that eventually fill in the entire table. \n\nI think his claim is that the order in which concepts and words are introduced has some secret sauce that has better self-reinforcing learning. Thats a difficult thing to prove or disprove.  Its good that he is thinking about that when building his courses. But to say that Michel Tomas DIDN'T ALSO think about that.... is pure assertion on his part. \n\nI went through the entirety of the Greek course for both LT and MT (and the old LT course too, before the rewrite). LT is better in that its free, and covers more material (for Greek. for other languages MT has much more content because LT is only an intro). Sometimes LT did a better job of explaining a concept. Sometimes MT did. I'm not sure I could claim one is fundamentally better overall/on average tho, for the parts they both cover. I think LT did sometimes introduce better mnemonic devices to help remember some things, better cognates to help link things. \n\nIn the end, a language has only so many concepts, and the most frequently used verbs and nouns are what they are.  So its not surprising that two programs that cover roughly the same material, using roughly the same mechanics end up being similar. \n\nThis is not a dig at Michalis or LT at all. I think what hes done is amazing and a huge gift to the world. But I don't think its as different than MT as he claims. \n\nThe big flaw (if there is one) in LT is that Michalis is putting together courses he is not native or fluent in, and in ones that he admits he doesn't speak (see note below).   That raises some real risk in my mind that he could have a concept wrong, or be missing something fundamental.  His course is excellent at transferring what is in his mind to our minds. But is what is in his mind correct? Also there can be gaps there on accent, prosody, etc. MT on the other hand has a lot more polish and editorial review. Most of the courses are written and taught by native speakers.  The chance that something there is straight up \"wrong\" is much less imo.   \n\nEven with that though, I still very strongly recommend LT to everyone who asks. For the casual learner who isn't going to try and become fluent, whatever gaps are there are likely insignificant. It will still get you far beyond the tourist or dabbler level most people get to, or that duo or pimsleur will get you to. For those who ARE trying to get fluent, it could leave some gaps and things to be corrected, but I think this is far outweighed by the speed and ease at which the foundation is laid down. The biggest hurdle for most learners is going to be motivation. And LT is really really good at making things painless so you don't get frustrated. Someone going for true fluency is going to need lots of vocab and practice and immersion afterwards no matter what,  so any problems introduced will have plenty of time to be fixed.  But I think thats true of MT too. But LT is free.\n\n\nNote : A snippet of a conversation I had with Michalis during the editing of the Thinking Method book. \n\n>[...I've not...] had a conversation in half of the languages I taught..\n\n>Are you saying you have taught languages, in which you have never had a conversation?

Straight people are absolutely not safe from monkey pox, if they have close contact or sex with an infected person.  Monkeypox is not an STD, and certainly not a \"gay std\". But it is easily transmitted via sex.\n\nbehavior within the subset of the gay community that goes to sex festivals very easily explains the current pattern of spread we are seeing. That does not mean this is the only pattern of spread that we may eventually see. Once someone in the highly promiscuous group was infected (likely someone who was from or visited an endemic country), it started spreading very quickly to others within the highly promiscuous group, because sex is by definition \"close contact\". \n\nI 100% agree with you, that for the majority of people, levels of promiscuity between gay and straight are roughly the same.  Pick a random gay person and a random straight person, and most of the time their numbers are going to be ballpark. \n\nBut at the peak promiscuity of each group is not the same. the highly promiscuous subset of the gay community is significantly more promiscuous that the highly promiscuous subset of the straight community.   This is not even a debated point.  Its been shown in study after study, and is freely admitted to by the gay community. \n\n\nNote : There are absolutely some valid criticisms about some surveys having sample problems.  Prior research into gay relationships has often oversampled users of Grindr, people who frequent gay clubs, male prostitutes, etc. (though I would argue that since we know many of the infected patients so far belong to that subgroup, that data is still useful)\n\nHowever, the surveys quoted below are random sample surveys, and are the ones quoted from anti-homophobia researchers.  They agree with you (and myself) that the average gay man is not significantly more promiscuous than the average straight person.

(women mean 6 with a max of 99)\n\nThe mean number of lifetime partners for gay men is 45, with a maximum of 9000.  That is not a typo. Ill admit these last numbers are a bit of an outlier.

An interesting contrast is Dickenson, which is dealing with a similar time period, and similar upper class white girls and their lives.\n\nDickenson also did race blind casting, and does also massive anachronistic music and lines. But plot wise they have ignored race, except as race was relevant in the story (a few episodes dealing with slavery). So it's an interesting confusion where some characters are black, and have relevant plot lines that are time contextually accurate. Other actors are black (or asian) , but their characters are effectively white for the story.\n\nBridgerton on the other hand took a different direction changing not just the race of the actors, but also the race of the characters.  I don't mind a \"what if\" alternate history, but I feel like this was poorly done. Regency england was rich. they were rich because of previously legal slavery and colonialism.  \n\nThe show drops in some divergences (what if the queen was black and she helped out black people), but largely leaves everything else the same. Changes to Britain's society and economy to allow for the people we see in bridgerton to exist would have massive other changes. Changes that are completely absent.  Jane Austen's England could literally not exist without fundamental racism.\n\nSomewhat worse, bridgerton defended itself from people who disliked the racial aspectsby bringing up the (not widely accepted) theory that the queen may have had black ancestry. I think this actually cuts against the show. The conceit of the show was \"if the queen was black this is what could have been\". But then they aregue that the queen really was.black -but none of that stuff happened.\n\nSeason 2 turns this up to 11, with nobility marrying Indian girls, during some of the darkest days of the raj. \n\nIn the end, I like the Dickenson approach better. But if bridgerton is going to do it their style, they did not enough. They needed to show more ripple effects of the change.  But that would fundamentally change the feeling of the show away from sexy escapist Austen knock-off, so I also understand why they didn't go that far.  But because they can't go that far, I prefer the Dickenson route. \n\n(Or somewhat more on the edge of related, shmigadoon did some lampshading/4th wall race stuff especially for the main  chars but mostly went down the color blind casting route for the village)\n\nAlso notably absent from bridgerton (and somewhat less absent from Dickenson) is class.  Again, I get it, it's escapist fantasy. But the (imo poorly done) focus on race makes the class divide a glaring ommission. Everyone visible n the show is rich, or at least upper middle class, with the exception of the printer boy in season 2. The dressmaker and the boxer are the only other significant characters who aren't rich, and they are both well off business owners.

A close examination of the ballots found that Mr. Bush would have retained a slender margin over Mr. Gore if the Florida court's order to recount more than 43,000 ballots had not been reversed by the United States Supreme Court.\n\nEven under the strategy that Mr. Gore pursued at the beginning of the Florida standoff -- filing suit to force hand recounts in four predominantly Democratic counties -- Mr. Bush would have kept his lead, according to the ballot review conducted for a consortium of news organizations.\n\nBut the consortium, looking at a broader group of rejected ballots than those covered in the court decisions, 175,010 in all, found that Mr. Gore might have won if the courts had ordered a full statewide recount of all the rejected ballots. This also assumes that county canvassing boards would have reached the same conclusions about the disputed ballots that the consortium's independent observers did.
