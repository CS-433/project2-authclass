If play correctly, she can get 5 hits in a matter of 40 seconds with a pretty high success rate, and that's insane.\n\nMeanwhile, Deathslinger has only 1 shot(hit or miss) before he needs to reload which gives survivors a lot of time, making it impossible to chain multiple hits by his gun solely. In short, his snowballing potential are far smaller than Huntress', and that alone outweighs the advantages of Deathslinger.\n\nWith that being said, I still prefer Deathslinger over Huntress because he is just more...
