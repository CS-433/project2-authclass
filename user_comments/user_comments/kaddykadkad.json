Most of my grades were based on attendance, and maybe an essay or test at the end of the semester.\n\nFor the non-exchange student classes I took, I took a class called \u65e5\u672c\u8a9e\u8868\u73fe which all regular students took in their first year, we basically learnt about doing presentations etc, and at the end of the semester we did a group presentation where we would pitch an idea for a TV programme for Japanese TV. No other homework or anything, I think it was 50/50 attendance and presentation grade.\nFor the other one I mentioned earlier, linguistics class, it was entirely attendance/participation based. We would attend each week, and then at the end of class we would fill in a paper on anything we thought interesting during the class, anything we would like to share etc. Then the professor would read through some of them at the beginning of class before moving onto the topic that week. The same thing happened every week, I don\u2019t remember doing any test or essay for that class.\n\nIf you wanna hear about the Japanese language/cultural courses I took I could talk to you about that if you want. But yeah for normal classes, you would need to at least be able to have daily conversations in Japanese without too much trouble in order to take them I think. It all depends on how much you learn before going, but also how much effort you put in when you are there.

It depends on the university you go to, but generally they will have Japanese classes for you to take, and if you are more confident you could also take certain classes the same as native speakers.\n\nI studied at Ehime university for a year. Most of my classes were focused around Japanese language/culture as they provided a comprehensive course for exchange students with different levels of language difficulty. I also took an extra class in linguistics because I was interested in it, it was more generalised so wasn\u2019t that difficult even though it was taught entirely in Japanese.\n\nI was in a similar situation to you, I had been studying the language for 7-8 years before entering university, and I studied for 2 years at uni before taking my year abroad.
