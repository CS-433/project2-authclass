It all gets boiled down to around 20 letters, so you only really need to memorize 20 letters and each pair of letters corresponds to an algorithm you have to make. How do you turn the shuffled cube into a sequence of letters? You give a letter to each sticker (edges, then corners separately), from A, B, C\u2026 to X. Then you memorize it by looking at a specific sticker and seeing where it has to go, so, for example the edge that\u2019s on position B in the shuffled cube would be in position G in the solved cube, so you memorize BG, then, you look at where the piece that is on G needs to go, let\u2019s say F, and then where does the piece that\u2019s on F needs to go? Let\u2019s say J, so memorize that too. Now you got BG FJ\u2026 you keep doing this for the whole cube. After you memorize it all, there are a few tricks and 3 algorithms you need to know to solve those pieces one at a time, following the order you memorized them in.

For the 500 dollars you would have spent in a 10 series card for example, you could have waited for the 20 series and gotten a better card for the same price! It's not due to a shortage, but the effect is the same: waiting longer will give you more for the same money...\n\nFact is, from a 970 to a 3060 you would notice a huge difference in performance (like reaching double the gpu performance according to benchmarks), and 500$ doesn't seem like a scandalous price if you keep in mind the current situation and the performance upgrade you'd be getting.

Yeah with me it\u2019s similar, my dad taught me to play when I was really young but I just got really interested in chess last year (when I was 18, now 19). And it\u2019s not that I want to necessarily reach a title or anything, but more that I love the game and I have this fear of not being able to get good (around your level, so using title as a reference point) at it anymore since I started late. When it comes to chess it seems like when you\u2019re young you have this learning superpower that goes away as quickly as it came, which is sad for those who develop interest a bit later, in my opinion.\n\nSince I am not that good at the chess yet and it\u2019s so complex, I don\u2019t really know what sort of brainpower is required to get to such a level (does this make sense? xD), so getting some feedback from someone who is there is great and reassuring, thank you!", "created_utc": "1614796709.0", "edited": "False", "id": "gpk9r5k", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_lwu5iw", "parent_id": "t1_gpk8f5b", "score": "2", "subreddit": "chess", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhr7"}, {"author": "Eaglewolf13", "body": "First of all, congratulations!!\n\nOther than that I have a question if you wouldn\u2019t mind?\n\n-Do you think it is possible for someone who starts chess after 18 to reach a FM title like you?\n\nCongratulations once again and thank you in advance for reading!\n\nEdit: I had 2 questions but you already answered one of them :)", "created_utc": "1614795807.0", "edited": "1614796036.0", "id": "gpk7myf", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_lwu5iw", "parent_id": "t3_lwu5iw", "score": "2", "subreddit": "chess", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhr7"}, {"author": "Eaglewolf13", "body": "Exaxtly!

That's why I thought it was maybe different from the normal vibrations... Can you also experience the vibrations if you just sit somewhere relaxed, and focus on them for a few seconds?

I was asking this because I although I have discovered astral projection a few months ago and am really interested in it, I haven't really had much time to practice ( I am always sleepy or have things to do... I hope I'll be able to do it in the summer ). However, during one of my few practices for astral projection, I kind of felt a vibration, or a flow of energy that went through my whole body almost as if it were charging my body up, and by focusing on the sensation, it got stronger and stronger to the point were my body would start twitching involuntarily and it would become so strong that I had to stop... And it was a feeling that I had never had experienced before and it was really hard to describe, however, I got really intrigued by this newly discovered sensation, because ever since I got it when attempting astral projection, I can always do it... I just have to focus on the feeling ( kind of like remembering how it felt, or imagining that I'm feeling it ), and the feeling will instantly come back, and I can just focus on it and intensify it as much as I can until it becomes too powerful to handle ( to the point where I actually devote so much energy to this feeling that I stop breathing )... I know this sounds really weird but I swear I am not making it up, and I have been on an effort to try and discover what this is and if other people have this ever since I discovered it... For the record I am not a believer in some kind of god,  and I don't blindly believe in every energy thing someone throws at me ( nor do I blindly believe in anything pretty much, I always tend to seek confirmation, or facts, or other people's opinions, or create experience of my own before accepting something as being true and claiming such thing to be true ), however, I do believe there is something bigger than us, something more than this physical world, and that's what I'm trying to explore, and this kind of energy kind of seems like it comes from that place...\nI would really aprecciate if you could somehow help me out in figuring out what this is or might be, or if it is in any way related to meditation/astral plane, whatever... I will gladly answer any answers you might have regarding this weird sensation...
