I'm in my twenties also and I've still never gone to college because I'm still trying to sort some thing out in my own life. There is absolutely NO SHAME in taking your time as far as university/community college/etc goes. You definitely don't want to be stuck in any debt if you don't have to be.\n\nMy first suggestion would be to see a therapist, because the negative views you hold seem to run especially deep and you should definitely talk about those feelings to someone so you can start feeling better and start seeing things more clearly from a realistic perspective, with that being said:\n\nTake the small steps you can while still living at home. Youtube is an amazing place to start in my opinion.\n\nWatch simple cooking videos on Youtube. I LOVE grilled cheese, making that is super easy!\n\nWatch videos on how to do laundry properly. If you're worried about ruining some of your clothes and that's why you hold back, wash everything on a cool/cold setting. This way your chances of transferring color are much less.\n\nDo you have a love for animals? Maybe you can try volunteering at your local animal shelter/humane society. Or do you have a passion for books/reading or maybe you just like peace and quiet? See if your local library is taking volunteers. Speaking of libraries, you should have a look in the Self Help/Personal Development sections and see what kind of books they have there so you can improve any different aspect of your life that you're unhappy with.\n\nMy advice is try volunteering for something you like for awhile first, then get a job if you can help it. That way you have something you can add to your resume as well as a reference, and you will feel really fulfilled, accomplished, and over-all just needed and appreciated.
