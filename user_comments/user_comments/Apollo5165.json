Imagine if when you go 3-0 up in a game of a football, the other team also has to send three of their own players off. The chance of a comeback is virtually impossible and before long it will be 10-0 with only one person left on the other team.

If you're 3-0 down with ten minutes to go, through no fault of the opponent you might be able to score three goals either by luck or incredible skill. This is not true in chess.

What I like about De La Villa's method is that any deviations from black in the latter half of the line are easily to calculate around usually just by wasting a move for zugwang. It's almost like you just ignore your opponent and follow the method anyway.\n\nI don't really like De La Villa's subvariations for early deviations though, so I found ones that make more sense to me analysing with stockfish. So, if the opponent deviates early (first 5 or so moves) then I use a different method that might not be the fastest but with the advantage that it's methodical and they can transpose back into each other pretty easily if the opponent makes further deviations, and it always ends in a position where whether or not it's black to move, it's an easy mate in 5.\n\nSo, while this works, and I'm comfortable with it now, it's pretty much just me recalling 4-5 weird lines that I learned off by heart and if black deviates from I learned by heart I know that an easy 1-2 move calculation is all that's needed to get it back on track.\n\nAll together it probably took me 10+ hours if I include all the reading, learning, videos, my own analysis with stockfish, making sure I had every gap plugged, etc (it would be easy to underestimate and think to myself that I learned it in an hour but when I really think about it and list out everything above, that's just not the case). And in the end, apart from knowing how to do the mate, I don't think I learned anything else useful about chess, so I can't help but feel like I wasted my time learning it especially given that I have never had to actually do it in a real game where I didn't intentionally trade down to B+N just to practice.", "created_utc": "1642030569.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hsf1d45", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_s0tqeh", "parent_id": "t1_hsc98fj", "score": "1", "subreddit": "chess", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhr7"}, {"author": "Apollo5165", "body": "You recommend that someone who likes open attacking games turns down the open Sicilian??", "created_utc": "1641975371.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hsbpoid", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_s1o2zd", "parent_id": "t1_hsboc02", "score": "5", "subreddit": "chess", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhr7"}, {"author": "Apollo5165", "body": "In life in general I agree, definitely, but I do see the point, in principle, in trying to keep education impartial on all topics, without making exceptions even when we can all agree that Nazism and slavery are horrific.\n\nFrom my understanding of reading the article (admittedly this may not be correct as I haven't read a transcript of the entire context), he didn't mean to specifically single out Nazism as deserving impartial treatment in education, but rather the teacher gave that as an example of where he is not impartial and the senator meant to argue that even then we should be aim to be impartial in education.\n\n\"I have no problem with the education system providing instruction on the existence of those 'isms.'

There is luck involved here even though you also had to do the hard work in the first place.\n\n- You might be good enough that you will spot roughly 90% of blunders into mate-in-1. If you miss one of these blunders in a game, while you can't really make any excuses, and improving this skill will help you to spot these more often, there was also an element of bad luck in you not finding it (as well as the good luck involved in that your opponent blundered into it)\n\n- Let's say on move 15 you need to place your bishop on one of two squares and you can't decide for sure which is better, but you go with one over the other anyway. Then lets say 5 moves later when you're calculating a potential tactic, the bishop ends up being a crucial piece in enabling the tactic by some defensive measure or something, for reasons you hadn't actually thought through at the time. There is clearly an element of luck (and yes, skill) involved there too.\n\n- You might calculate a tactic for 20 minutes and you think you've found an answer to every possible defense from your opponent, but it actually turns out there is a very difficult to find move that refutes it. There is both skill and luck involved in both you finding the move or not, and your opponent finding the move or not.\n\n\nIn the long term elements of luck are minimised and skill has an even greater effect.\n\nAnother example:\n\nLonger term - element of luck minimised:\nCarlsen has been the highest rated player in chess for over 10 years any I'm sure almost every agrees, it's hard to see someone else surpassing him any time soon.\n\nShorter term - element of luck at its highest:\nDespite this, he's still not guaranteed to win every competition he enters because of various element of luck that could play a crucial role in any game between two such highly rated players.", "created_utc": "1634313386.0", "edited": "1634314817.0", "id": "hgr35pe", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_q8jaa0", "parent_id": "t1_hgqzg8g", "score": "1", "subreddit": "chess", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhr7"}, {"author": "Apollo5165", "body": "Exactly, so there are elements of luck involved.", "created_utc": "1634311100.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hgqxkei", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_q8jaa0", "parent_id": "t1_hgqbgy9", "score": "1", "subreddit": "chess", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhr7"}, {"author": "Apollo5165", "body": "Then explain how a 1000 rated player can lose to a 990 rated player.\n\nIf they're better, and no luck is involved, then they should win every single game, or at least never lose.", "created_utc": "1634296681.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hgq4u01", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_q8jaa0", "parent_id": "t1_hgppos5", "score": "0", "subreddit": "chess", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhr7"}, {"author": "Apollo5165", "body": ">Through GDPR you can ask for all info they have on you and they have to comply.\n\nAnd how exactly is receiving back a file with nothing more than his own email address supposed to help him in any way?\n\nIf you're talking about his game history he can already export that separately using the feature lichess set up for that, but that's not personal data that would be covered under GDPR.", "created_utc": "1634113381.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hggl71u", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_q70sw4", "parent_id": "t1_hgg94do", "score": "8", "subreddit": "chess", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhr7"}, {"author": "Apollo5165", "body": "In fairness I think the main reason people play 960 is to avoid the opening theory of standard chess, so it makes sense that you wouldn't like to draw the standard position in a game of 960.", "created_utc": "1634028137.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hgbzyai", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_q60wpv", "parent_id": "t1_hgatqpo", "score": "3", "subreddit": "chess", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhr7"}, {"author": "Apollo5165", "body": "If you already knew openings weren't necessary then why the need to tell your beginner/intermediate self?", "created_utc": "1633988365.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hga17y9", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_q616wp", "parent_id": "t1_hg9ptlo", "score": "4", "subreddit": "chess", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhr7"}, {"author": "Apollo5165", "body": "All about that tilt life", "created_utc": "1633978314.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hg9emsn", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_q616wp", "parent_id": "t1_hg98fml", "score": "27", "subreddit": "chess", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhr7"}, {"author": "Apollo5165", "body": "That's definitely true.

That's just not true. I'm not playing against super GMs, I'm playing against other players at my level (currently 2045 lichess, but I think I was around 1700 when I made the switch) that aren't exactly booked to the teeth, to say the least.\n2. I turns out I actually don't mind learning a bit of theory. It's not nearly as bad as I thought it would be when I first started playing chess and it's something you can just learn as you go. You don't need to wait until you know everything before daring the play it, at least not in online chess. And in the Najdorf especially I find that the moves and positions actually make a lot of sense once you've studied it a bit and it's pretty easy to remember the moves and main plans in most variations/games.\n\nBut possibly the most important thing for me is not only that I know it's a sound opening I can play and learn for the rest of my life, but also I actually really enjoy the varied positions I am getting from the opening (compared with when I was playing the Caro-Kann, where I began to dread seeing 1. e4 on the board because almost every game went into very similar variations of the advance.\n\nApart from my frustrations with the Caro-Kann at the time, what finally made me decide to make the switch to the Najdorf was when I saw [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRgJ_rX9bCI) video from Andras Toth (and I had heard similar ideas from other strong players around the same time: Sam Shankland, Peter Svidler, Jan Gustafsson).\n\nBasically the argument is that if you want to become a better chess player in the long run your opening repertoire should do two things:\n\n1. It should allow a large variety of structures so that you learn more and develop your chess understanding on a greater level.\n2.

It's actually one of the lower scoring defences against 1. d4 at higher levels, both online and OTB master games.\n\n>I thought it's not enough to know more about the Grunfeld than my opponents as black, as it's easier to play as white than black when you don't know your stuff.\n\nI've heard this too, but I think it depends on when you start learning it. The Gr\u00fcnfeld seems to score very well even at lowers levels on the lichess database which I don't think would be the case if it was so easy for white compared to black without knowing theory. I know that this is similar to the King's Indian, in that as you get better, it gets more difficult and theoretically dense for black than white, but unlike the King's Indian, it keeps scoring well and is considered sound even at the GM level, where the King's Indian is not.\n\n>About the semi slav, isn't this setup passive and looking to play for equality as black at best ?\n\nI think this can be the case if you don't know much apart from the first few moves, but it gets fairly sharp as you get more in depth, in my opinion at least. For this reason I initially didn't like it and was considering ditching it, but I am starting to really enjoy it lately. However, I will admit, black versus 1. d4 is where I've had the most difficulty in choosing an opening and it's the only one I'm not 100% sure of or committed to.\n\nThe main issue for me with the King's Indian, and why I stopped playing it is even if it's playable, if I'm going to learn a difficult opening I'd rather pick one that's not even slightly dubious, and quite a few coaches argue that you can learn more and improve your chess faster by playing openings that contest for the centre in a more direct way. This doesn't necessarily have to mean 1...d5 or ...e5, as the Nimzo-Indian, for example, fights for the centre immediately even if not necessarily with pawns.", "created_utc": "1616076338.0", "edited": "1616077246.0", "id": "grcyskp", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_m7lydg", "parent_id": "t1_grcqfyz", "score": "0", "subreddit": "chess", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhr7"}, {"author": "Apollo5165", "body": "Well I should preface the below by first saying that I'm not exactly very good at chess (yet!) so take whatever I say with a grain of salt, but I have spent probably way too much time considering this issue myself and reading and listening to advice from top coaches.\n\nThe Nimzo is a great opening, but the problem with it is you need to pair it with another opening for if your opponent doesn't play 3. Nc3 and there is a fair amount of theory needed because white has so many different variations of the Nimzo they can go for. Normally this wouldn't be too much of an issue, as that's sort of the case with any opening, but this would have to be on top of whatever you're already using against 3. Nf3 and others so it really is just pure extra work.\n\nWhen I was looking at it for myself, I worked out that if you try and play the Nimzo-Indian you'll only get it in about 27-33% (depending on rating) of your games as black against 1. d4, and only about 9% of your games as black in total.\n\nSo, in my opinion it's just not worth the time investment (yet at least, but I might learn it one day) as I don't think it's adds enough return on investment, so to speak (compared to learning a Sicilian variation against 1. e4, which yes, it's a lot of theory but at least it's a complete answer to 1. e4 that you'll be able to use in about 60% of your games as black.)\n\nBut coming back to the original question, you can't go too wrong with any opening that's well-respected at the highest level. The King's Indian and Dutch are both slightly dubious, and the problem with the King's Indian is you're always left in a cramped and slightly worse position, and there's a lot of theory needed to play it right. If you're going to put in the effort to learn an opening that requires a lot of theory I think it's better to pick one that's better for the long term, and ideally more principled, in terms of a more direct fight for the centre and should give you varied and instructive middle-games that you can learn a lot from. Although if you really love the King's Indian positions and middle-games, at least it's better than the Dutch, but you better be sure you love it, because the better you and your opposition get, the worse the King's Indian gets and you might end up wanting to switch openings and regret all the time you spent on it.\n\nI'd rather pick something like the Semi-Slav or Slav (which you can try transpose to against 1. c4 and 1. Nf3 as well, or the Queen's Gambit Declined or even the Gr\u00fcnfeld if you're very ambitious and don't mind a short term sacrifice for long term benefit (yes, it's a huge amount of theory, but you only need to know more than your opponent, and you could play it as your only answer to 1. d4 forever).\n\nIn case you're interested, what I myself play against 1. d4 is the Semi-Slav.\n\n**Edit:** But in the end of the day, you could still feasibly become a great player by playing nothing but the King's Indian or the Dutch, but it definitely doesn't seem optimal, and I'd say anyone that's made it to a high level with a sub-par opening could have become a bit better a bit faster if they had picked a better opening sooner.", "created_utc": "1616071550.0", "edited": "1616071811.0", "id": "grclpzp", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_m7lydg", "parent_id": "t1_grccdsx", "score": "1", "subreddit": "chess", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhr7"}, {"author": "Apollo5165", "body": "Both poor choices if you're looking for long term improvement.", "created_utc": "1616064756.0", "edited": "False", "id": "grc98rc", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_m7lydg", "parent_id": "t3_m7lydg", "score": "2", "subreddit": "chess", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhr7"}, {"author": "Apollo5165", "body": "You're trading an undeveloped piece for a developed one, ruining his kingside pawn structure and making his king vulnerable to an attack in the next few turns.

Incredibly minor, all things considered, compared to most.\n\nAnd like I said before I'm guessing most of the people in the sub are in a similar position to me, hence the overwhelming support for lockdowns.\n\nThe reason I'm against lockdowns is because of the massive damage it's causing both in the short term and the long term for everyone. Mainly and especially those less well off than myself and most of this sub.\n\n>You've shown you've done basically no research outside of what suits your narrative.\n\nActually my stance has changed on this since the beginning, precisely because I don't only believe what suits my narrative.

Is anyone analysing whether we'd be able to save more lives and improve quality of life for more people if we took some of that time back to researching all the other causes of death and suffering that we've been largely neglecting since March?\n\nThe answer is no.
