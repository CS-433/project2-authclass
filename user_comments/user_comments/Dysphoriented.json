[{"author": "Dysphoriented", "body": "There will be spoilers, so you have been warned.  \n\n\nSo, interesting story about this game. I bought it at launch because I love everything Shinji Mikami touches, RE, Vanquish, Dino Crisis etc. But I just could not get into this game. The first few chapters were \\*horrible\\* to play. The difficulty curve was so ridiculously unfair, even on normal mode.  Introductory bit is cool, uncanny almost, really interesting and grabs you, but I will always remember the game putting me in the middle of nowhere, telling me I have 6 bullets and three matches. It continues to explain that you can kill people faster with headshots but you still need 3-4 shots to kill one enemy even at the best of times and you only have three matches so how are you going to possibly get through the whole village in front of you?   \n\n\nI walk towards the house and I get stuck in a bear trap, damaged immediately and alerted enemies, which feel like they are at least 30-40 (again, I only have three bullets left because I had to kill the first turned police officer), I get killed and start over. This time im smarter, I thought. I would look out for the bear traps but miss the tripwire mines so they blew up and got half of my health and the entire village was again alerted to my presence. Die, start over, im a bit frustrated. I eventually beat the first bit, where I have to keep going through the woods until I get to a valve I have to turn, while all the enemies hear me and I somehow have to get rid of them before I continue.   \n\n\nI die, die, die and die, it is so difficult and frustrating that I quit. I try to replay it at least four more times as the months pass but the fifth time I get so angry that I physically throw away the disc, because it is such complete unfair nonsense, I feel like I never had a chance. Months pass, a year or two and I see the case again, almost like it is mocking me. I decide that I genuinely love Mikamis work enough to give it one more chance, a final chance, just one more time.  \nAfter all, I really want to like the game.   \n\n\nAll the previous attempt had one thing in common, I never made it past the third chapter, so I promised myself, I would get past the third chapter and see what comes after the part where there is a chainsaw enemy stuck inside a barn. I try very hard and eventually I get to a point where im being chased with little to no health. I climb up a ladder thinking that they shouldnt be able to follow me up there, alas, they can climb ladders, too. I get so annoyed that at this point I decide to show my friend through PS4 crossplay or whatever that feature was called, because it cant just be me, there has to be an element of unfairness.   \n\n\nEventually I get past the third chapter and I thought, wow, that was extremely difficult, what is even on the other side of this chapter? And thats when it happened. I realised the game wasnt unfair bullshit, it was just teaching me to never expect to be safe, at any moment I could be harmed, I am not strong like in games with the hero archetype, I am weak, the every day man. The way this realisation came upon me was very Dark Souls-esque. I finally got it.   \n\n\nThe more I played, the more I loved the game, the way it constantly starts to mess with you, the way you are never ever safe, the way Ruvik haunts you no matter where you go. The game was attempting to make me feel helpless.  \n\n\nMy favorite enemy in probably all of video gaming is The Keeper, the bit where you keep running away from him only to finally shut the door behind you, a large metal vault like door, thinking \"finally, im away from him\" and having it subverted immediately with him snapping his own neck to respawn inside the room that you are in? Abslotely marvelous, I genuinely felt afraid of him.   \n\n\nThe actual story is scattered through newspapers and collectibles, sometimes cutscenes, so you understand the motives behind all the people, the DLC adds something that actually matters for once (except the keeper dlc lol) and overall I believe this game is at least on par with the original Resident Evil in terms of quality horror. It really bothered me that Mikami did not direct the sequel because it was clearly lacking his touch. I played it but I felt like it sold out its soul to make it open world, just like everything else at the time. I much prefer the claustrophobic \"you are never safe, not even for a second\" tight scope of the original.", "created_utc": "1666899888.0", "edited": "False", "id": "iu13qxq", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_yen69n", "parent_id": "t3_yen69n", "score": "3", "subreddit": "patientgamers", "subreddit_id": "t5_2t3ad"}, {"author": "Dysphoriented", "body": "Personally I think it is the most insulting entry by far.

The problem is systemic, not individual.   \nCapitalism has made the industry stagnate to the point where everyone is too complacent to understand that anything released that is better than far cry isnt a masterpiece.   \n\n\nCyberpunk was horribly broken at launch and it was sold to us with false promises, it deserved all the critique it got. They have finally started fixing it but it should have been released in a state that was playable, and for most it just wasnt.   \n\n\nHorizon Forbidden West stagnates because it doesnt attempt to evolve on any concepts that were created in the original. While it is true that more of the same can be good too, my belief is that any sequel should try to innovate and expand upon the concept created in the original game.   \n\n\nElden Ring has this problem, Breath of the Wild has this problem, Red Dead Redemption 2 has this problem. People need to stop excusing mediocrity.   \n\n\nElden Ring is just Dark Souls in an open world, its not that special, Sekiro and Bloodborne took the concept of the original and expanded on it. That is actual innovation. Calling Elden Ring an \"unparalleled masterpiece\" is an insult to any kind of creativity.   \n\n\nBreath of the Wild is empty and soulless, it is the bare minimum of what a Zelda game is and almost every single Zelda game that came before it did what it does but better.   \n\n\nThings arent masterpieces just because you get an open world to play around in because the open world is ultimately worthless if its padded to the brim with pointless side fluff.  \n\n\nRed Dead Redemption 2 is essentially the same exact story as Red Dead Redemption, with a different character and less compelling.

Which I think it is.  \n\n\nIt's likely due to the amount of critique I just levied against all these popular games, that I will get some sort of question along the lines of \"What do you even like then?\" so I can address that.   \n\n\nSome of my favorite games are those that break the mold of what a game is meant to be.   \n\n\nDeath Stranding is one of the best games I have ever played and one that I would be okay with calling a masterpiece.

While this is obviously true, that disregards part of the analysis, likely because people do not want to accept that they are part of the problem. We see this all the time in contemporary society as well, the pivot from systemic to individual.  \nIt is easier to say it is the company itself (which would mean it is the high ups who simply want profit) than to admit all of us play a part in normalising these practices. Much like we do within capitalism. Let me explain what I mean.   \n\n\nLiberalism, the current hegemonic power structure within society, innately necessitates a certain level of apathy and complacency in order to function. This manifests itself in many different ways but one of them is the constant beating down of the population through means of violent propaganda. From the day we are born until the day we die, we are taught to view everything through an individual lens. School shootings? Bad people will always be able to get their hands on guns. The system is intrinsically unfair for those who are disadvantaged? They simply arent trying hard enough. Any systemic issue always becomes individual within this framework because the status quo must be maintained at all costs.  \n\n\nWhile it is true that corporations that are greedy are the main problem, much like how the working class has been misled into voting against their own interests for the past two decades globally, the truth is that companies within the video game industry employ similar if not exactly the same strategy to beat gamers down into accepting mediocrity in games or sub-par conditions. I am reminded of a discussion I had with a friend where they admitted Call of Duty is not a very good franchise because the companies behind it try to constantly screw the playerbase over by implementing more and more features that are predatory in nature.   \n\n\nThink of the frog in a blender, just like corporate capitalism tries to find the perfect balance between screwing over the working class just enough so that the company gets the most amount of profit while keeping the workers from revolting, so does video game companies.   \nFirst it was microtransactions, then it was loot crates, then it was season passes, then multiple season passes. People cried out in anger and sometimes rarely \"won\" to the point where companies would change their practices, but only for that one game, the next iteration the practices were back. They want to normalise the practices to the point where we become so apathetic to their marketing and their practices that we accept it as normal part of playing video games.  \n\n\nTo this end players and companies exist in a symbiosis with each other. Even if unwittingly, we still help normalise the practices when we buy the same CoD or FIFA every year filled with predatory practices. The internalised apathy and complacency is just part of a larger scheme and much like with the rights of the working class, the most important thing to combat the dreadful companies is to teach people about this relationship to an extent where they understand that the power is within them as a collective. If they all agree not to buy a game, companies will lose out to such an extent that they are forced to adapt and we have seen this happen multiple times within the video game industry.  \n\n\nMany people will not believe this but we do have the power to change companies. Just look at any time something is trendy, motion controls or battle royale. Why do you think even Call of Duty jumped on the bandwagon that was battle royale? Because it was deemed to be profitable. Companies are drawn to do what is profitable and it is only through mass-complacency that things keep getting worse and worse. If everyone rises up against the tide, we could attain real change, just like the working class could in a larger societal context.   \n\n\nTLDR; The power is within all of us and only together are we powerful enough to provoke change.", "created_utc": "1648431989.0", "edited": "False", "id": "i2dwysl", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_tnznc1", "parent_id": "t3_tnznc1", "score": "3", "subreddit": "truegaming", "subreddit_id": "t5_2sgq6"}]
