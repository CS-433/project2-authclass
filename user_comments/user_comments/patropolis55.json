It won't be perfect but I managed well enough. My comment has gotten a bit long, i'm sorry - i'll stick a list of vocab on the end maybe. Also sorry for all the weird formatting.\n\nFrance is an espresso culture. If someone comes in and saying \"un caf\u00e9 s'il vous pl\u00e2it\", generally this means an espresso BUT in France the espressi are not usually the same as, say, an espresso in a typical 3rd wave caf\u00e9 - French espresso is usually a fairly long shot(prob 3:1 ratio or more, often crappy beans etc). Things like flat whites, proper cappuccinos(French cappuccinos tend to be extremely foamy); they aren't really in the cultural zeitgeist just yet. I'm not telling you that you should make espresso this way, but just that typical french coffee culture might be different to what you're used to depending on where you're from. It'll depend too on what your boss wants. Sometimes people just want it with a little bit more water(which i'd just add either before or after, like an americano).\n\nSo, someone asks for **\"un caf\u00e9\"**, you can ask if they want it a little longer(regulars will know the deal) by saying **\u00ab un peu allong\u00e9? \u00bb** or **\u00ab un peu plus long? \u00bb** basically meaning \"a bit long/a bit more long?\" Americano will be **\u00ab am\u00e9ricano \u00bb** or **\u00ab un caf\u00e9 allong\u00e9 \u00bb**. On the flipside, if someone wants a shorter shot, sort of ristretto or something(maybe some Italians), it'll be **\u00ab un peu plus seri\u00e9 \u00bb** - tbh I often found that Italians often asking for ristretto meant something closer to a modern 3rd wave espresso, basically they didn't want the classic french caf\u00e9.\n\nYou might have to explain the difference between flat white, cappuccino, latt\u00e9 - I would normally explain it as **\u00ab le flat white est un double espresso avec un peu du lait chaud, le cappuccino a plus de mousse est le latt\u00e9 est le plus grand \u00bb** meaning \"the flat white is a double espresso with a bit of hot milk, the cappuccino has more foam and the latt\u00e9 is the biggest\".

I enjoy talking to people in my job, mostly to the customers to be honest, it's nice to talk to people and remember there are people who are good fun in the world. \n\nI woke up a little earlier today and watched the sunrise a little, my girlfriend had to move back home for a few months to work so i'm here by myself. Last time she was away, I didn't do anything that actually made me feel good, so this time i'm making a strong effort to do stuff. Even just to eat a meal and get outside for a few breaths of fresh air makes a huge difference if you let it! I dedicate my next glass of lovely french wine to you!", "created_utc": "1631117929.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hc2oz4x", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_pk3790", "parent_id": "t3_pk3790", "score": "1", "subreddit": "CasualConversation", "subreddit_id": "t5_323oy"}, {"author": "patropolis55", "body": "I feel like the label is a bit more applicable for something like Senua, it's super cinematic and imo is very much experience-centred.

The fact that it's about healthcare makes it more controversial because the person is then denied a necessary healthcare to keep them alive or simply healthy. \n\nI agree that services have costs, and those should be paid for. \nI don't think i'm advocating for FREE STUFF FOR EVERYONE. But I think what the desired system actually is, is that the services should be *paid for*, so that those who can't pay still receive care.  Normal people already pay taxes, I would wager that if you asked, most people would be happy enough to pay a tax which supports the healthcare system, they would also benefit from that. The system would be paid for already, people wouldn't have to die by refusing an ambulance because they can't afford it(to use an american example). \n\nThe thing that I always get stuck on with it is that I really feel that if someone is denied healthcare because they can't afford, it really misses the point that that person is another human being. It always seems to come down to \"if you can't pay for it you should basically die\" because that's what comes across.

However my point despite my poor choice of wording is more that the avenues to education are somewhat restricted to those from lower income backgrounds at least in the US(I know you might be frustrated that  I keep mentioning the US after saying I wanted to try to keep it more broad, sorry. At least in terms of militaries it's hard to avoid). \n\n>They don\u2019t seem to help? In what respect? I believe you mean to say they should help more. Because the millions of taxpayer dollars would disagree that \u201cthey don\u2019t help\u201d.\n\nOk, I agree here. More help would be good. I think regarding the question of responsibility of the community vs government, I think from your insights I would say that it is the responsibility of both to help our hypothetical gentleman in need, but on different levels. I think that yes, we must help each other and those in greater need as members of our community, and this can happen on the local, interpersonal scale. Whereas the role of government would be to implement and support systems or structures that facilitate this help. Does that make sense? I think it still falls under government responsibility\n\nThank you for discussing this with me! I'm not using this as a conclusion to our discussion but I just wanted to acknowledge and thank you for your insights, I think it has helped me better understand the roles of government(always learning!). \n\nI'm still a little unclear on your position on the interaction between community and governmental support though. Obviously there's contention in this full thread as to how much the government should be supporting people, how if people want to help they should just donate to charities instead of reallocating taxes. Of course that's a multi-layered topic too, giving more to one thing means taking from another etc and how do you choose. Would you agree that in a good system, that the people would help each other and their community with the support of government funded initiatives? \n\nTo be honest, one of the main issues I have surrounding topics like this is the language around \"they don't deserve help\". I feel that it is very dehumanising and divisive, and really quite unhelpful when it comes to trying to have conversation about it. Not saying that you are using this but it's one of the things that bothers me most about it I suppose.", "created_utc": "1612884343.0", "edited": "False", "id": "gmpeheb", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_lfqqox", "parent_id": "t1_gmp4tvi", "score": "2", "subreddit": "TrueOffMyChest", "subreddit_id": "t5_2yuqy"}, {"author": "patropolis55", "body": "Thank you for your response! \n\nI disagree that the OP really states that really. He's saying he'd rather the money be spent to help people, he doesn't say anything about forcing anything. He doesn't offer any specific ideas so I don't think it's fair to assume what he would like beyond what he has already said, especially as it seems like a venting of frustration. \n\nWhy does it necessarily have to be an authoritarian government? OP doesn't even suggest higher taxation or anything. At the very most he is simply asking for a better redistribution of whatever national budget they have. I think it's more accurate to say that he wants the government to do better for its people, it's not about forcing anyone to do things. Of course, in a democratic nation then if someone disagrees they are allowed to speak up and if the majority agrees then it passes. If a referendum was held and the majority voted in favour of spending more money on social programs to help the poor and struggling, does that count as forcing those those voted against it? \n\nAs for the main part of your response: I think I agree that it's good for people to take responsibility. But I disagree that if someone can't take action to help that they don't deserve help - particularly when they \"can't\", as in they are unable to take action. The question there becomes, why can't they? What systems led them to this point? I think it's a little harder to be as forgiving to those who \"don't\" help. However I think that's a separate issue to what we are discussing here. You say that the government has responsibility to help people - I agree, and I think that's what the OP is talking about too. The rest of your response seems to be more of a criticism of corrupt and ineffective governments rather than people needing help. I also totally agree with your last point, that if we used half of the half tax for charities we would be much better off, and I think that's exactly what the OP would like too. \n\nI suppose my side of it here is that people should be helped, *especially* those that can't help themselves. If you have a homeless man on the side of the road, no food, no home, holes in his shoes and freezing, how could he help himself? Get a job? How does he apply? Does he print out CVs, does he have a printer, does he have money for the library printers? How does he get ready? Does he have good clothes for the interview, somewhere to wash? If he gets the job, how does he get paid? Most places don't pay cash, he needs a bank account. Most banks need a home address to open an account, but he has no money to rent somewhere. That person has all of these barriers to overcome, with no support apparently because he doesn't deserve help because he doesn't have the strength or means to help himself.

That's correct. However I don't think that most people worry day to day about foreign threats. Is the US constantly at threat of invasion or war? I don't sit around thinking \"I feel unsafe because our military is weak\". The US has a strong military complex in its culture, but this is partly because so many people are forced to join to have any chance of receiving an education or healthcare from the VA. So you have thousands passing through the ranks, many will be naturally more sympathetic to the military. Thank you for your service doesn't fix trauma, nor does fighting wars against insurgents in various far-off countries help the citizens of the US. Of course many will disagree with that, that's my opinion on it anyway. If the US spent half as much money on providing actual stability for the people it might get something done. Billions of gun black dollars evaporated into fighter jets and rifles. Thousands dead fighting in countries they'd only heard of on the news, fighting for causes they didn't believe in because they were forced by the US systems to join the military so they could go to college and have some sort of semblance of a good life.\n\n>Why is it ok that those with the most ability, power and wherewithal to help are not expected to help the people?\n\nRegarding this, I was asking rhetorically. 100% tax is a bit silly of course. But the fact remains, in my opinion, that those in power are most able to help, and yet they don't seem to do so.

Obviously it's an extreme position, not necessarily typical, but how could an individual in his position help himself? It's superbly difficult. I anticipate you will say, \"the community should look after him\", and I agree that that would be great. Help a man retrieve some dignity and move forward. But my question from this is: How could this not be a matter of concern for the government? If it's a local government matter, I presume their budgets are defined by the State government, and the State defined by the Federal. All of those branches support the people at various levels, all of them serve the people in various ways. I will admit that from what I can gather, that the relationship between State and Federal governments in the US is a little more complicated than one being the others boss, I concede as much. But still the ruling comes from the top. CEO of a company says \"Everyone must abide by these clothing regulations\" and it happens company wide. I think the same goes in the government.

Surely a government should be able to help them, through social projects, financial support, expert advice - which are obtained and supported by substantial funding(I mean this in the sense that a government generally has a large budget compared to an individual, not that we should blow loads of money on stuff).

To say that women or men are less capable in the dominant areas of their counterparts is not really that accurate is it? Engineering is the classic example, where women are often outnumbered. To say that women are less capable than men in the engineering field is patently false, there is nothing inherent in a woman that makes her worse at engineering problems. Which leads to the main crux of the issue for me: the issue is not of capability, but of systemic sexist structures. \n\nWomen have been treated as second-class for a long, long time. I remember being shown a Home Economics book from the 1950s, with a whole section on how to be a good wife. Have the dinner ready for him when he comes home from work. Don't talk to him until he talks to you first, he may be tired and wants a rest. Even later in the 20th century you had laws which forced women to stop working and become homemakers once they had a baby. Legally restricted from work for having a baby. It follows too that the industries which we now see as male-dominant are that way because women weren't allowed to study engineering, become a doctor, even still there's the common assumption that a man is a doctor and a woman is a nurse. Why does that assumption exist? Where does it stem from? \n\nI don't know if I like the term mansplaining. As others have said, it can be a little divisive perhaps. But truly, the reason I haven't liked the term is because it shines a light on my own prejudices, and on the ways that I have negatively affected silent women who simply took it because that's the way it is, and I said it because that's the way it is. So I did not like the term because it showed me for what I can be, a man who through learned societal behaviours said things that made women feel diminished. Put simply, it makes me look bad and that doesn't make me feel good. So naturally I want to resist it. \n\nMansplaining is not an ideal term to begin a dialogue perhaps, (in terms of men who don't want to talk about that because it means they have to examine their behaviours) but you have to remember that women are fighting uphill to have any sort of dialogue on sexism at all. They are already coming at it from a weaker position. And I think in that sense, mansplaining as a term has been a decent beginning in providing language and a conversational starting point for us to talk about the sexism that still exists in our societies.", "created_utc": "1612622538.0", "edited": "False", "id": "gm8fxq1", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_ldwptc", "parent_id": "t1_gm8cwdg", "score": "91", "subreddit": "changemyview", "subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8"}, {"author": "patropolis55", "body": "Bananas always give me cramps if I eat one before the morning run.

I think it's fair to want a place where you can talk about the things you want. I think the real overarching problem that I can see is this divide between these two sides, which we now call left and right, or conservative and liberal. Because I don't think that you are totally against talking to someone of different beliefs right? It's just that the language around politics drives a wedge between you, how could you have an actual conversation when every phrase is so supercharged? I know how frustrating it can be to try to debate someone and they are just shut down to you. \n\nI am very critical of cancel culture, for example, because I think it disallows any morsel of nuance. It happens too fast, and it's just too simple. Similarly, I might say that your desire for somewhere you can have a nuanced discussion about your politics is pretty much the same as a safe space, which the left has been criticised for particularly around the need for safe spaces for LGBT+ people. \n\nI'm not really sure where my point is here. But I do know that in order for peace, people must talk, truly communicate. I'm not saying this is your fault, or anyone's really(barring maybe the government for stoking fires around many things). But nevertheless the onus is on everyone to try to come together. Even to say \"the left/right argue in bad faith\" deepens the division in my opinion. It might still be true, but it takes a wide brush and paints lots of people and makes them a group. The real work has to be one on one, as we are talking now, as people. \n\nSorry for the long reply, but I'd love to know what you think! cheers", "created_utc": "1612554193.0", "edited": "False", "id": "gm5hlxd", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_ld1v82", "parent_id": "t1_gm4ogef", "score": "1", "subreddit": "Conservative", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh6p"}, {"author": "patropolis55", "body": "Are you not willing to debate though, if someone asked?

Nor is he taking vast amounts of land for agriculture etc etc etc. This whole thing sounds really dumb honestly, what does your gf think happens? Can she bring herself to watch nature documentaries?

If she does and still pushes getting rid of the cat, then I'd abort abort and get out of there because in that case she would clearly care more about her damned ideas than you and the other people in her life. If she doesn't see it, I would actually lean toward saying that she hasn't considered your feelings in this at all. Scenario 2 there is potentially redeemable since maybe you can help by showing her the flaws in her world view and talking it out - know that this would be a long path because it is hard, persistent, incremental work that changes people, and in my opinion I think you should spend your time working on yourself in that regard, to build your own view of the world that includes everyone and cares for everything. Maybe you'll hold onto veganism, or maybe you just picked it up because she asked and it made you happy to make her happy. Mittens makes you happy too, just from unconditional love. \n\nThat feels like a long ramble to me, but to look back it seems that she has some flaws in her thinking regarding both veganism and in how a relationship should work.

He wrote so many pieces for so many instruments, and he did a banging job in my opinion. My appreciation of his music comes largely from playing it on piano - feeling the counterpoint weaving around under my fingers; studying his chorales in my college harmony classes - seeing how hard it actually was to do what he did while still making melodies of the lines; and singing his choral works in the choir. I dunno, I just fell in love with how he wrote, and love hearing his music. I think people might have difficulty hearing the emotion in his music because I think he speaks to deeper spiritual feelings, and also naturally because that true romanticism that developed a little later didn't really exist in the same way imo. You have to let yourself go when you listen to it and just feel. So great. \n\nGreat example that I am LOVING recently is [Violin Partita no.2 in D minor, BWV 1004](https://youtu.be/qtyTaE7LvVs), here played by Itzhak Perlman. [Hilary Hahn](https://youtu.be/YhCoV8SP97Q) is also pretty boss at it, especially because her recording was done at the age of 17! And also here is [Shunske Sato playing it on period instrument, gut strings and a baroque bow among other things!](https://youtu.be/44Wz92zQe04). It amazes me that Bach could write such deep music for just four strings, and Brahms felt the same, saying in a letter to Clara Schumann \"On one stave, for a small instrument, the man writes a whole world of the deepest thoughts and most powerful feelings. If I imagined that I could have created, even conceived the piece, I am quite certain that the excess of excitement and earth-shattering experience would have driven me out of my mind.\"", "created_utc": "1576450047.0", "edited": "False", "id": "fb2fe29", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_eb4h79", "parent_id": "t3_eb4h79", "score": "7", "subreddit": "piano", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qnw8"}, {"author": "patropolis55", "body": "Well done!

I just think it is so dismissive honestly, of course the vast majority of concertgoers will not understand the individual subtleties of solo piano playing vs the minor adjustments in the voice of a singer vs bending a pitch on a saxophone to match a singer singing flat. But is their opinion so valueless to you because they haven't spent the hours and hours learning about these things like you have? I think it very off-the-mark, technically focused opinion to have of the value of the average persons opinion. It's not like you can't enjoy a Liszt sonata until you reach a certain point of understanding of basic harmony or done your Grade 8 piano exam. \n\nYour wide knowledge of music and deep understanding of it enhance your experience of it. When I hear some Bach chorales, I enjoy it so much more than I did before I really tried writing them in college, or paid attention to how well he writes for the voices. If I send them to my friend who knows very little about classical music, he still enjoys them in his own way. His enjoyment isn't worthless, the music still speaks to him in a way that he understands, even if he doesn't understand its intricacies. I find your sentiment that it won't matter for an audience if you leave a lot out just really gets me down honestly, I feel it just shows a lack of respect for the audience and a very technically-focused mind(which I suppose explains why you feel the way you do). Your technical mastery shouldn't be the be all, end all, it should ultimately be your tool to communicate with an audience at an emotional level. That's what makes the great composers so great, is that they can reflect emotions in a way that anyone can understand in some regard, while still being masters of their craft. They aren't esoteric about it. Those boys were class.\n\nYour first line in that comment is \"I think it connects with you emotionally and you assume everyone else gets it.\" when your entire sentiment speaks of the opposite. You connect with it emotionally on the level that you are able to, and assume the audience doesn't get it. And yeah as I said, maybe they don't get the small details. But they can still get the music and feel something from it. It's the whole thing with detail - an audience sees the whole painting and appreciates the overall image. An amateur painter will see and appreciate the subtle brush strokes on the painting, or the masterful use of colour. A professional painter will see even more detail in the work(I'm showing you my knowledge of painting there, I don't have an example for that one lol).", "created_utc": "1574687643.0", "edited": "1574687985.0", "id": "f8opk74", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_e1bgl5", "parent_id": "t1_f8oatff", "score": "3", "subreddit": "piano", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qnw8"}, {"author": "patropolis55", "body": "I love playing for myself for sure, it's a lot easier to be relaxed and play nicely and not to worry about mistakes.

If you're just playing for friends in your living room, that pressure is self-imposed, but hopefully you wouldn't feel super pressured to be perfect in front of your friends. Friends are friends\n\nI think there's a lot of be said for both, honestly. Playing in front of people, in your living room or whatever, does give you a certain buzz to work hard. I think being able to manage your emotions in that situation - emotions which are naturally heightened and more chaotic - is a really good skill to have in everyday life, outside of piano playing too!

It's hard to find the same things in them, you won't find the same forms, or instrumentations or even certain styles of music that didn't exist! But throughout all of that music, there is something you are always hearing but not aware of. Bach, Beethoven, Brahms and Messiaen all served the same idea. I could rattle on for ages about this but honestly I feel like it wouldn't make a difference to you. \n\nI used to not like Bach either, until I started playing it. There is all this passion in the world about Bach(which is partly why you are posting about it now, because you \"don't get it\". I would agree that you don't get it). All this passion and you have managed to remain unaffected. Other people have given great lists of music to listen to, give them a blast and see then. Try to deeply understand it. I understand (at a fairly basic level admittedly) the music of Xenakis, but right now it doesn't speak to me. That's probably because I don't know enough spectralist music, and don't have a relationship with it.\n\nMy suggestion is the Chaconne(final mvmt) from the [Violin Partita No. 2](https://youtu.be/6KaYzgofHjc), and from that the [Brahms transcription of that for the left hand only](https://youtu.be/y8-nWq6pqag). Both pieces are superbly difficult. As Brahms wrote to Clara Schumann in a letter: \"On one stave, for a small instrument, the man writes a whole world of the deepest thoughts and most powerful feelings. If I imagined that I could have created, even conceived the piece, I am quite certain that the excess of excitement and earth-shattering experience would have driven me out of my mind.\"", "created_utc": "1568585665.0", "edited": "False", "id": "f0fma5i", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_d4bf5s", "parent_id": "t3_d4bf5s", "score": "4", "subreddit": "classicalmusic", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhyq"}, {"author": "patropolis55", "body": "Same for me, the real magic in Bach is not often the listening but in the playing.

I guess when you're meeting people in an effort to make friends and build longer-lasting relationship than those you make in a restaurant while working, there's a certain amount of pressure on you(both from the situation and also from yourself) that makes it a little harder to be as aloof. It's always important to realise that most everyone is a little uncomfortable in social situations, there's a lot going on and various types of energies and all kinds of stuff. The most important thing is to be yourself and to let yourself be known. I know that's super clich\u00e9 but I believe it. I always say that if two people are portraying \"characters\" of themselves, rather than just honestly being themselves, then the relationship is then being based on approximations of the people. You can only truly be yourself. \n\nI always find with these sorts of comments I just ramble on for ages and feel like I haven't said anything.

The thing I try to always go back to is being honest with myself. All of the stuff you talk about, it's all looking at Maria and the experiences with her as \"what if\", it's looking at her like she is some sort of symbol to you of a good person, wanting to be with someone like that is ok but at the same time I think you should try to be clear with yourself whether you are doing that or not. It sounds to me that maybe you are unhappy with how you are, and your time with Maria was good fun. She makes you feel good, so it's easy to assume that you would be happy together. There's no way to know one way or the other right now(unless you did enter into a relationship. but it also sounds like neither of you is in that position to make that happen). \n\nI am in love with a girl at the moment. We are great friends. She recently broke up with her boyfriend of 4 years, and it's been really tough on her because it ended so badly. Last December(before they broke up, that is more recent) my feelings for her had grown quite strong, to the point where I felt like I couldnt' be around her without getting emotional and in my head. I ended up telling her how I felt, and it didn't work out. But what I said to her was that it was really important to me that we remained friends, the friendship was largely the reason I felt that way about her. The situation is different now and we are still friends. I try to be a good friend to her when she needs it, and that is the important thing, I can't make her do anything either, and if we were to start going out I would only do it if she felt she was ready for it and that she wanted it. To me, being in love with someone is already being their friend, and I think you can love people and only be friends. I think it's a slightly different way of thinking about love but I think that's a healthy thing to learn. I see love as a spectrum, there is a certain point along the line where it becomes romantic, then that changes into something different. Kinda like different forms of electromagnetic radiation! Nice. But you can go right up to the line, love someone and still be their friend.\n\nI dunno mate, this shite is tough going. It can be difficult to live your life when you are so focused on this, and let's be real: all of this exists in your head right now. I think the best thing you could do is find a friend you can talk to, say things out loud and hear how they sound. When you put something out there it becomes real, and you can't take it back. You can also hear whether it makes sense or not. It's really important to look inside yourself and be honest with how you are feeling and why. I'm really sorry that you are not feeling good dude, life can really suck. But at the same time, you are 22 with so much ahead(I'm only 24, but if I think of all that happened in the last 2 years it's crazy). Keep looking forward, keep yourself open to seeing other doors, and meeting other people, and trying new things. A girlfriend is nice to have, but let's be honest you can use having a girlfriend as filler for something else you're missing in life. Look inwards and nurture that little human seed inside you, look outwards to see where you can take yourself and how you can live a good life.

And also, these are my opinions so take what you like, it's definitely not gospel lol\n\nOverall you have a great grasp of the piece, it's all well under the fingers and sounding good! It's hard to get a good grasp of your dynamics from a phone camera recording, but from what I can gather I would think you could look into bringing them out a bit more. The piece is a beautiful contrast between the A and B sections(with the beautiful melody), Rachmaninoff wrote that contrast into the piece, so I think it would be good to consider that in an overall sense of dynamics across the piece. I personally prefer a slightly faster tempo too, perhaps that affects the articulation of the notes. \n\nFor me in the A section, the melody and accompaniment are not distinct enough, it's there a little but I think you could go further. Even in the first bar, you have the G octave, followed by the chords in the middle register. They need to be sufficiently different, the chords here are not creating the melody but a colour around it. I also feel like this melody in the A section is a little too legato, like in the G-A-Bb-D bit in those octaves at the beginning. Again, it's almost there but I would like a little more pop from them. Try not to bog yourself down in exact details, it can get in the way if you forget to see the forest for the trees. Just remember that this music needs that commitment from you. It's quite punchy in my opinion. Perhaps you are relying too much on the pedal! Experiment with that. \n\nThe B section is so beautiful in this piece, and you do a great job! I think you need *much* more rubato in this. Listening to it, I see myself sitting in a train travelling through grand mountainous landscapes, like a quick reprise from the rest of the piece. That's a bit weird but there you go. I just think the melody needs to breath so much more, it needs to get out of the metronome mark and be free and alive. Listen to any other lyrical Rachmaninoff stuff - [Piano Concerto 3 @ 4:02 - Martha \"Hammerfingers\" Argerich](https://youtu.be/MOOfoW5_2iE?t=243) or [Piano Concerto 2 @ 2:24 - Anna Fedorova](https://youtu.be/rEGOihjqO9w?t=144). Particularly No. 2, that section I linked is so similar to the B section in what you're playing. Do you hear the difference in what I'm talking about? If you are unsure of where to change the rubato, a more defined thing I could tell you is to follow the contour of the melody. But you have to feel it to make it real! For me, I hear a crescendo in the second phrase leading into the third, that'd be one breath for me(if you were singing). They're connected. I [recorded a short vocaroo](https://vocaroo.com/i/s1lIKkYX5C9I) of what I think could be done, the quality of my mic is a bit shite but sure look. \n\nYou are really on a great path here with this piece! It sounds great and you just have a little push now to get it up to something really magic, keep at it! Rachmaninoff is such a beautiful composer, full of heart and life, and romantic emotions. A truly multi-faceted composer.

I just kinda fell in love with Leclerc honestly. His story and the trials he overcame, while still being a bombing driver really speaks to me. That whole story of him heading to Baku two days after his dad died, at the  age of 19, and then winning everything - it's just an incredible feat. It inspires me. \n\n3. nah mate, pick who you want! Feck the rest of them! Follow who you like, that's what F1 is about. \n\n4. I don't know if I fall under this bracket since I've only been following since 2017, but I enjoyed it a little. It bothered me that they left different things out, for the sake of drama and other things. I get that they want to attract new fans, but for me the fact they omitted that Perez and his sponsors triggered the administration for Force India so that they could play the \"will he get the seat\" game, that was a bit much for me.
