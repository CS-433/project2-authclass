Towards us, and especially towards your wife. Your post shows very clearly that no, you don't understand fibromyalgia. Which wouldn't be a problem if you didn't insist that you do. So yes, many of us are actually worried about how you're going about it because it sounds more like you wanting to \"fix\" this situation instead of actually really supporting your wife with what SHE needs. (If that is not the case, maybe reflect on why your wording made us misunderstand your intent--many of us have pointed out problems in your language.)\n\n1) Diet. No changes in diet have ever had any impact on my fibro. None. Diet can't fix this. Some people may feel a little better cutting out certain foods, but my suspicion is that they may have underlying undiagnosed issues that cross-react with their fibro. Still worth a try, but absolutely let her take the lead and let her eat what she feels like.\n\n2) Exercise. If you really want to help her find the right kind and amount of exercise for herself (which may be none, or only very little, and that's okay too!), help her find a good physiotherapist who has experience with people with chronic pain. There is no type of exercise that helps all of us, and exercise can actively be harmful. So again: Let her take the lead! Frequency is whatever she feels is helping/not harming her. Type of exercise is whatever she feels is helping/not harming her.\n\nSome types of exercise that she could try out: Very gentle and self-paced (and adapted!) yoga, going for walks (however far she feels like, can be up and down the street, can be a few km at a time), stretching (literally what helps me the most), maybe specific strength training (best done under the care of an experienced physiotherapist, and sorry, I don't think a personal trainer who generally works with healthy people is the right kind of person here).\n\n3) Supplements. Don't expect much from those. That being said, it is absolutely worth it to get her vitamin and mineral levels checked out to check for any actual deficiencies (especially vitamin d as a vit d deficiency can cause a lot of the symptoms common with fibro!--note that even with a vit d deficiency, taking vitamin d might not help at all with those symptoms). I also take magnesium as per my physiotherapist's and my neurologist's recommendation, to help with muscle twitching and cramping.  \n\n\n4) Stuff you haven't mentioned:  \n\\-> Rest is important and necessary and not laziness!  \n\\-> Sleep is very important as a lack of good sleep can make every other symptom worse. However, for a lot of us, our sleep just fucking sucks (not restful no matter how long we sleep), and no, a good sleep hygience, fix bed times, and all those common tips do not work (well, they might for some, but they did literally nothing for me). What did and does help me some (sleep is still crap but less crap than without): low-dose antidepressants, CBD oil, melatonine (I used to take a low-dose antidepressant for about a year, then switched to CBD oil after hearing about it and making sure it also helps, and I sometimes use melatonine as a once-off aid to fall asleep--may backfire as I sometimes jerk awake after a few hours from a nightmare). Also, listening to my body and a) not forcing myself to go to bed at a \"normal\" or \"reasonable\" time, and b) sleeping in when I can and feel my body needs it.  \n\\-> Grief! Your wife (and you probably too) should take the time to allow yourselves to grieve, and to work through your grief. This diagnosis is shit. It's a life sentence. There is no cure, and treatment options are limited and really hit or miss. I had to quit working at the age of 29. Many others with fibro eventually have to reduce hours or quit working as well. We lose so much because of this illness, and there simply is no way to just \"fix\" it no matter how much we want to and how hard we try.  \n\\-> Cognitive problems (aka brain fog). Memory, the ability to find the right words, the ability to express ourselves, concentration, all that is wonky and changes constantly. Some times our brains seem to work just fine, and at other times we struggle to even think straight.\n\nOther ways you can help your wife:  \n\\-> Just be there for her. No suggestions, no trying to fix it, just be there, listen, accept.  \n\\-> Don't ever make her feel lazy or like she's not trying hard enough. We WANT to be better so we are already trying our hardest.  \n\\-> Small things like making her a cup of tea, cooking the meal she's craving, calling a doctor to make an appointment for her if she struggles with it at the moment (ask first!), ... stuff like that can really make a shitty day better.  \n\\-> Don't expect her to automatically do all the housework even if she stops working. While some of us are able to do that, others are not, and no one can tell you where your wife falls (or will fall in the future). Instead, communicate and try to find solutions that work for both of you.\n\nI'm hoping that your wife can find ways to manage her symptoms at a level where she can still be independent, but please be aware that there is a possibility that she may require a lot of help down the line.

I've been going to mine for over five years now, once per week, and it really helps keep stuff somewhat under control. This doesn't mean that my pain is gone, not even that my daily base pain is significantly lower, but I have fewer flares with bad muscle pain, and we're trying to keep my tension headache flares to a minimum, and he helps with all kinds of muscle and joint issues that creep up (and is also great at helping me figure out whether something needs to be checked out by a doctor or whether I can try specific exercises and stretches first to see whether it gets better--my fibro loves mimicking other stuff like arthrosis and carpal tunnel syndrome so sometimes it's \"seems to be coming from your muscles, try this and see whether it gets better\", and at other times it's \"huh, no clue what that could be, better get it checked out to be sure\").\n\nAs far as what's been helping me most:\n\n1) finding something that helps with my insomnia!!! (lack of sleep makes everything else flare so this was my number one priority) -> at first my rheumy put me on a low dose antidepressant that unfortunately didn't help with my pain (it may, though, so worth a try) but did help with my insomnia, so I stayed on it for about a year until I heard about CBD oil and tried it, and got off the antidepressant with my rheumy's okay to see whether the CBD oil alone is enough (most of the time it is, I can adjust the dose flexibly aka take another drop when I have a lot of stress for example, and if I really need some extra oomph, I take melatonin--but be warned, it can backfire and give you really weird dreams or nightmares and jerk you awake after a few hours)\n\n2) physiotherapy and gentle exercising (yoga, stretching, strength training, walking) is helping me keep stiffness and muscle tension somewhat under control and thus reduce bad pain flares\n\n3) heat and/or cold (depending on body part for me, try out which one helps where)\n\n4) pacing myself: this one is/was the hardest as it meant giving up working\n\n5) learning to listen to my body again after almost three decades of hearing \"you're fine\" when I was in fact not fine (closely connected to #4)\n\n6) a change in mindset from feeling sabotaged by my own body, to imagining a little Minion really trying its hardest to manage this faulty model of a body as best as possible -> instead of being angry and frustrated, I now try to listen to my body and figure out how I can support my Minion in dealing with whatever problem came up\n\n7) allowing myself to grieve!!!\n\nI really wish you something else, something that can be easily treated to give you your life back, because when all is said and done, fibro is a really shitty disease. Find a better doctor, one that is willing to actually listen and work with you.

That it doesn't take a lot of time and commitment? That it is so much easier than, say, learning Spanish for an English native?\n\nHeck, even some learners who have no interest in English at all and would rather learn a completely different language may have to learn English first just because there are no resources in their native language available to learn their TL.\n\nAnd to think that the fact lots of internet spaces are default English-speaking is a benefit for non-native English speakers instead of realising that it puts non-natives at a disadvantage in discussions compared to natives...\n\nYou know what my real advantage over native English speakers was? Not the fact that I \"had to learn English out of necessity\" but the fact that the German school system does NOT suck at teaching languages, and forces students to learn at least one (usually two, with a third optional) foreign language up to a high intermediate level. I grew up in a pre-internet area (gosh, I feel old typing this) and honestly, it wouldn't have made any difference to me which languages were mandatory. If not for English, I would have just learned a different language instead (and there are schools, or at least there were at that time, that did not default to English as the first foreign language). Because ultimately, English isn't as easy as some of you are making it out. English tenses can be highly confusing for German learners, and your spelling vs. pronunciation is a nightmare compared to many other languages. So in terms of difficulty, it probably wouldn't have mattered to ten-year-old me whether my first language was English, French, or Spanish. Dutch would have definitely been a lot easier. And as far as usefulness goes, either Turkish, Russian, or Italian would have been much more useful to me back then since those languages had considerable numbers of native speakers where I lived. For vacation, I should have learned Danish as my parents loved Denmark and we went there three times during my childhood. My school exchance was with France. And if not for the small English bookshop owned by a British immigrant in my hometown, it would probably have been easier to get my hands on French or Dutch books than English books since I the Netherlands, Belgium, and France were much closer to me than the UK.", "created_utc": "1661273374.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ilh6h82", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_wvounl", "parent_id": "t3_wvounl", "score": "5", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "Miro_the_Dragon", "body": "So in other words you have uncontrolled asthma but no indication of actual low potassium.

I also have days where I manage to study for several hours (vocab, grammar, reading, ...).

My symptoms had always loved to mimick stuff like arthrosis (especially in my knees), and I did have the genetic testing for hereditary arthrosis in my teens as both my father and my father's father had it (test was negative, I still have several other risk factors for developing it in my knees) so that was a big one that needed to be ruled out (along with other rheumatic diseases like arthritis, which would have shown up in the tests ordered as well).\n\nI eventually got a double diagnosis of vitamin d deficiency and fibro because nothing else could be found, but since my low vitamin d levels can cause the majority of my symptoms, that was treated first to see whether it was the main culprit.

Neither doctor gave me shit about it and both were seeing it as their normal duty to check out new complaints (yes, I know that is unfortunately not the norm--they're some of the few good doctors I've found in my life).
