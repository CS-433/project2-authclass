How can you decide what is best for China if you do not even understand China? \n\nWe're told so much how people in other countries, countries that walk a different path to the west, are brainwashed and yet we fail to realise that we are no less \"brainwashed\" than they are. When Kim Jong Il dies and state mourning is enacted it's a \"brutal repression of the will of the people, supplemented by paid actors and maintained by the secret police\" but when Queen Elizabeth dies it's \"Her gracious subjects paying tribute to a figure so prevalent in their lives, a true world leader\". The real truth is that they're probably both equally state suppression of dissent and a genuine show of respect for a national leader at the same time, our media machine just amplifies some voices and details over others depending on which narrative they want to push. \n\nUnderstand that we are not immune to propaganda and we are fed a constant stream of it every day.

First of all imma preface this with the fact that I'm vehemently against needless blood shed and I'm not tryna promote anything other than a nuanced view of the conflict, but there is a vast level of depth to the troubles that is vastly more complicated than the IRA murdering innocents. \n\nBefore the troubles it was a shit time to be a Catholic in NI, you couldn't join the police force, you had barely any political representation, there was no hope in hell of getting into the ship building or textile industries (the 2 largest industries in NI at the time) and if you fell on hard times and lost your house the government would sooner house a single Protestant person than your whole Catholic family. It was unliveable, Catholics were practically forced into poverty by the rest of society while the good jobs and political power was left for Protestants, and people had had enough of it. Catholics started protesting for equal rights, mostly peacefully at first but as the NI state began to crack down on the marchers with violence, certain members of society felt that it was necessary to start taking up arms in response, starting decades of bloody fighting and hundreds dead in the crossfire.\n\nDuring the decades of conflict while there was fighting, the British intelligence service was in league with pro-Protestant paramilitaries like the UVF and was aware of the vast majority of the attacks they committed and even helped plan some. MI6 even suggested some attacks against the IRA that even the UVF considered to be too brutal (see a cancelled attack on a primary school in a Catholic area, it was cancelled because IRA reprisal was feared), it was very much not just the IRA that bloodied their hands and in many cases it was the Protestant institutions that thought up some of the bloodiest acts of the period.\n\nAnd yet we only talk about the IRA and their actions, despite the fact the British Army and associated forces were in NI to keep the peace but were in close talks with unionist paramilitaries. We also don't talk about the oppression of Catholics or anyone else perceived as nationalist by the NI government in the period leading up to the conflict and the facts surrounding the very real mistreatment of those people by the state on the basis of their religion and/or ethnic identity.\n\nI'm not in support of one side of the conflict or the other, it's over and we're only marginally further ahead than when we started, there's no point. However, I think it's really telling about who controls the narrative surrounding the conflict when the only conversation we have focuses almost exclusively on the victimisation of unionists and other supporters of the British state with nothing being said about the uphill battle that Catholics had to fight for even the most basic civil rights.\n\nThere's a good chance this will get downvoted, and to that I say I'd rather get downvoted for challenging an inaccurate but politically comfortable view of history than be upvoted for parroting a biased narrative.\n\nEdit: I also notice a lot of people here are talking about their childhood experiences in the troubles, I do not mean to minimise anything you may have experienced, just encouraging you to recontectualise it", "created_utc": "1662311405.0", "edited": "False", "id": "in2s1fh", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_x563sk", "parent_id": "t1_in0cnze", "score": "0", "subreddit": "HistoryMemes", "subreddit_id": "t5_2v2cd"}, {"author": "Fear_mor", "body": "Not really imo, sure he's \"brought over\" some people but not really.

If there is no migration out of Africa how does this happen? People don't just begin to exist for no reason.

Put it to you this way, if I'm building housing developments and the government turns to me and says we're lowering your standards, I'm now able to get a greater return on investment by creating a new plan than with my current plan, so why would I go ahead and build my current plan if my new one can make me more money? This obviously stalls availibility as a lot of developers realised this and scrapped their current plans to come up with newer, more lucrative ones which pushes back the time to completion as they're basically just starting over from scratch.\n\n>I also would have thought that higher density housing would be a desirable outcome in the context of a housing crisis where there aren't enough units to meet demand?\n\nIdeally you want good quality and high density housing, whereas a lot of these \"Co-living\" developments aren't really much more than subpar housing being built to exploit young people who can't afford the alternatives, like you wouldn't be able to start a family or have really any kind of consistent stability in that kind of environment, people need their space. Unfortunately developers largely don't care about that because they're making bank off the market, which is why so many of these builds are problematic, they aren't really fixing the problem but playing into it to turn bigger profits. \n\nThink of it this way, they're not building housing for people to buy and own, they're building housing for people to rent so they can leech off tenant's income, offsetting the risk of investment because if you're not turning a profit it's somebody else's problem and you are liable to chase after the money you've lost. Whereas if you sell the house and somebody else owns the deed you don't have that consistent income stream and you're not only turning over as much of a profit, you're making a riskier investment", "created_utc": "1659709523.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ij22smv", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_wgp0x0", "parent_id": "t1_ij187ck", "score": "3", "subreddit": "ireland", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhb9"}, {"author": "Fear_mor", "body": ">Or did he spoil her?\n\nLet's be real here she's not a child, she's a grown ass woman.

If Russia were weaker, Chechnya would as independent as Estonia, where the United States consistently undermined the Soviet government. One might link the materiality of United States support with the fact that Estonians are white Christians while Chechens are not, but that's beside the point.\n\nAnd America hasn't?

Whether we should support a Russia that stifles incipient democracies, though, seems to delve into pro-Russian apologia (which I'm opposed to on the basis that people ought to control their own destinies). Chechen independence seems neither pro-America nor anti-Russia but frankly pro-Chechen.\n\nFirst of all nobody has said to support Russia, those are just words you've put in my mouth again. My point is we should make responsible choices in this war to assure it doesn't become a major crisis and hopefully come up with an outcome that promotes peace in the region, balkanising Russia would very much be a step against that. Also I find it hilarious that you call Chechnia a democracy, during the period it was independent it was effectively a confederation of criminal warlords, fighting against the Russian government, it really was not a democracy.

Like I think it shows up the most in the housing sector where the costs of buying/renting a house are very unaffordable for a lot of people and the government does nothing to combat the root causes (vulture funds buying up new developments, inefficient use of land space, landlords being grubby, etc) because it makes money and fills their coffers, additionally they don't feel pressed to act because for the people coming in and working in that cash cow type industry we have here are getting on fine, it's the little guy that suffers and since money talks and they don't have much of it it's very easy to ignore their voices and just not do anything to help.\n\nIn my experience as a Dub born and bread, this country has two very different faces depending on who you are and where you're from and I think our government pursuing this path is two our detriment as a whole, I don't see a future here for myself, so I'm leaving, partially because I want to, partially because I feel if I'm to thrive that I have to.", "created_utc": "1659111922.0", "edited": "1659112113.0", "id": "ii58we5", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_wajle5", "parent_id": "t3_wajle5", "score": "1", "subreddit": "ireland", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhb9"}, {"author": "Fear_mor", "body": "Ahhhh there's a museum?

You should probably get a therapist and deal with this trauma, give yourself time to heal and then maybe if you've cleared out the skeletons in your closet you should then reapproach dating, but as I see it now I think you're better off going your separate ways, as someone who's love language is touch I just would not survive the kind of relationship you seem to want (which is why I'm a bit passionate, so sorry about that)", "created_utc": "1657999747.0", "edited": "False", "id": "igfifky", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_w0il7m", "parent_id": "t1_igf0apc", "score": "11", "subreddit": "relationship_advice", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r0cn"}, {"author": "Fear_mor", "body": "I see why these fell out of use now", "created_utc": "1657957461.0", "edited": "False", "id": "igdbdm3", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_vzy9wy", "parent_id": "t1_igc99b4", "score": "16", "subreddit": "linguisticshumor", "subreddit_id": "t5_2vwiq"}, {"author": "Fear_mor", "body": "Would yoten not make more sense?", "created_utc": "1657957415.0", "edited": "False", "id": "igdbbgf", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_vzy9wy", "parent_id": "t1_igbvx8j", "score": "7", "subreddit": "linguisticshumor", "subreddit_id": "t5_2vwiq"}, {"author": "Fear_mor", "body": "Woops I misread", "created_utc": "1657914165.0", "edited": "False", "id": "igayu6l", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_vz0byg", "parent_id": "t1_igakp6l", "score": "1", "subreddit": "linguistics", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhos"}, {"author": "Fear_mor", "body": "Others yet still keep /tj/", "created_utc": "1657908368.0", "edited": "False", "id": "igakfne", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_vz0byg", "parent_id": "t1_ig5ulle", "score": "2", "subreddit": "linguistics", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhos"}, {"author": "Fear_mor", "body": "In Irish it's these. \"heileo\"", "created_utc": "1657888159.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ig9800e", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_vz9o26", "parent_id": "t3_vz9o26", "score": "2", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "Fear_mor", "body": "I mean maybe you should also hate them because they infringe on the rights of Palestinians as well", "created_utc": "1657887934.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ig97kz9", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_vz372f", "parent_id": "t1_ig6n4oq", "score": "7", "subreddit": "shitfascistssay", "subreddit_id": "t5_383xv"}, {"author": "Fear_mor", "body": "I mean in this case what exactly have they done?

For example we have actually very little evidence of Irish being brought to Ireland, even though we know chronologically it very likely arrived in the Iron Age, the only major sign of arrival is in the bronze age with Bell beakers who very probably didn't speak any ancestor to Irish, so very obviously archeology isn't everything. \n\nAdditionally they assume place names are constant and unchanging which isn't actually the case, for example we know parts of France spoke Gaulish at the same time D\u00e1il Riada existed, yet we have very few traces of Gaulish place names in France, any reasonable person would not conclude that Gaulish never was spoken in France, so why should we assume the same for Argyll and the inner hebrides due to the lack of place names? \n\n>Never meant to give off this vibe - I was simply misinformed.

It's just really unfortunate that so much misinformation exists out there, like so many Wikipedia pages to do with Gaelic have been edited to present the claims we discussed here as undisputed fact and I think that's just quite frustrating to see, especially considering how people who don't know better will just wrongly assume that it's 100% true. It's not the only thing this exists for either sadly, I've seen people claim Yola died out in 1998 which is complete unsubstantiated horseshit, and of course there's the whole Scots Wikipedia debacle, Wikipedia really has to clean up their act a little", "created_utc": "1656952831.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ieu3rpe", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_vr2aei", "parent_id": "t1_ietmuql", "score": "2", "subreddit": "gaidhlig", "subreddit_id": "t5_2tift"}, {"author": "Fear_mor", "body": "Ye sure I can link you to the D\u00e1il Riada wiki page\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D%C3%A1l_Riata?wprov=sfla1\n\nIf you read through it here you'll see that almost all seanchas, written by Gaels largely of Scottish origin, points that D\u00e1il Riada (the original Gaelic speaking kingdom of Scotland) was founded by settlers from Ireland,see the legend of the 3 brothers. Bede (a prominent English historian in the 8th century) also states that D\u00e1il Riada was founded by Gaels. Additionally the article also tackles the misinformed claims that Gaelic was autochthnous to Scotland by pointing out the main short comings of the main hypothesis and explaining pretty well how we know Gaelic arrived in Scotland from Ireland. \n\nIt is my personal feelings (perhaps others may disagree) that the idea of Scottish autochthony exists as a revisionist stance that aims to legitimise Gaelic's position as a piece of Scottish heritage in the face of many frankly just racist arguments that it's an Irish invention and has no place in Scotland (very much untrue, regardless of origin it is absolutely a piece of Scotlands heritage). While such viewpoints can be attractive and seem to deceptively be fairly logically, usually on the part of the author trying to deliberately make the evidence look more compelling and accepted than it actually is in the eyes of the scientific community, it is important to remember that writing can often be biased for one reason or another and therefore it's pretty good to get acquainted with the up to date understandings we have of history and healthily question and probe anything that doesn't quite fit (to an extant, the point isn't to be dogmatic, it's to be methodic). The idea of a Scottish origin for Gaelic is a fringe position, supported by seemingly just one or two historians out of thousands, and disregards historical writings on the subject without much reason or any alternative sources. \n\nAs for the Roman Attestation I think this might be a good idea to research the Irish raids on Britain during the 5th to 6th centuries, this article sums it up really well\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scoti?wprov=sfla1", "created_utc": "1656939076.0", "edited": "False", "id": "iet9kp9", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_vr2aei", "parent_id": "t1_iet0hp5", "score": "4", "subreddit": "gaidhlig", "subreddit_id": "t5_2tift"}, {"author": "Fear_mor", "body": "Ye but like what?

If we compare languages that we believe derive from a common source we can, in a way, turn back the clock to reveal a sort of working model for how the most recent as for  common ancestor of the languages involved behaved and would've sounded like. \n\nIf we apply this principal to Irish and its linguistic relatives such as Welsh and, in ancient times, Gaulish, we can see that a dramatic transformation has occured, especially when we compare Irish to Gaulish, and as such when we compare the languages we can posit that the time of divergence is far, far further back in time than the historical attestation of these languages due to the sheer amount of innovation that's occured in the intervening millennia between them all. When you compare this to archaeological and cultural evidence you can begin to tentatively connect these proto-languages to material cultures, in Irish's case this could be as far back as the Bell Beaker culture or, more likely, with the advent of iron smithing on the island.\n\nAs for what was spoken before, we don't know. Indo-European languages have been expanding westward (and also eastward but that's less relevant to the topic) from the Ukrainian steppe for the past 6,000 years, replacing the vast majority of Paleo-European languages that were spoken across the continent from the Neolithic to the Iron age. That does not mean though that we do not have records of them though (and actually we have a survivor which is particularly relevant to this question). \n\nThe Basque people are currently the only surviving ethnic group that have linguistic connections to Pre-Indo-European Europe, their language is what's called an isolate, which means that it has no known relatives that are alive or dead, however there are cognates (related words) between Irish and Basque that can potentially shed just enough insight into the Pre-Celtic language of Ireland that we can begin to speculate its origins. Words like Irish \"adharc\" and Basque \"adar\" (Both meaning an animal's horn), as well as Irish \"ainnir\" (from middle Irish \"ainder\") and Basque \"andere\" (Both of which mean woman). However these could've been shared either from Proto-Celtic to Basque (or a related language), vis versa, or they could've come from a completely different language all together or perhaps it's just coincidence they look similar, we just don't know for sure. \n\nTo answer your question about scripts as well, Irish was first written in the Ogham script, which was based heavily on the Latin alphabet, before then switching to Latin in the Old Irish period.", "created_utc": "1656698401.0", "edited": "False", "id": "iehadmr", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_vp3bmw", "parent_id": "t3_vp3bmw", "score": "41", "subreddit": "IrishHistory", "subreddit_id": "t5_2tlyg"}, {"author": "Fear_mor", "body": "Big agree, I wouldn't change a thing", "created_utc": "1656692183.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ieguzzn", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_vp0jb4", "parent_id": "t1_iegqam0", "score": "3", "subreddit": "teenagers", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjli"}, {"author": "Fear_mor", "body": "Yes I'm sorry", "created_utc": "1656667249.0", "edited": "False", "id": "iefjjto", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_voluas", "parent_id": "t1_iee3boc", "score": "12", "subreddit": "languagelearningjerk", "subreddit_id": "t5_37rt5"}, {"author": "Fear_mor", "body": "**Irish proficiency test**\n\nA1 - You think you're bad because you don't understand how to read\n\nA2 - You think you're bad because you don't understand the genitive\n\nB1 - You think you're bad because you don't remember to put infinitives after their objects\n\nB2 - You think you're bad because you don't know what things like \"s\u00faiste\u00e1il\", \"su\u00edst\u00edn\" or \"graf\u00e1n\" mean\n\nC1 - You think you're bad because you don't understand idioms and cultural references like \"saol an mhadra bh\u00e1in a bheith agat\" or \"cara sa ch\u00fairt\"\n\nC2 - You think you're bad because you can't read texts from the early 1100s AD", "created_utc": "1656635217.0", "edited": "False", "id": "iee2pfy", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_voluas", "parent_id": "t3_voluas", "score": "70", "subreddit": "languagelearningjerk", "subreddit_id": "t5_37rt5"}, {"author": "Fear_mor", "body": "Counterpoint: \u0421\u0430\u0445\u0430\u0440\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u041f\u0435\u0441\u043e\u043a", "created_utc": "1656629297.0", "edited": "False", "id": "iedpm6j", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_vo7ubr", "parent_id": "t1_iebcsoa", "score": "5", "subreddit": "linguisticshumor", "subreddit_id": "t5_2vwiq"}, {"author": "Fear_mor", "body": "I'd like to tag on my own 2 cents here, I think it should be said that when a decision doesn't affect you yourself tangibly it can be hard to truely grasp how deep it affects others, be that when it comes to anything.

Russians are imperialists, Ukraine is for Ukrainians, when the question is so much more complex, in this area of Europe clear borders (political, ethnic and linguistic) are recent inventions, people historically have moved about bringing their languages and culture with them. Basically this whole area has been a melting pot of so many different people groups and I think it's a mistake for Ukrainian and Western political structures to push the idea of the monolithic Ukrainian state instead of respecting the multicultural nature of the area.\n\nTldr; I wouldn't say this is an imperialist conflict, but rather an ethnic one, as such whether Russia poses a threat to other European countries depends on how well Russia perceives them to treat its people in their country, ie.

And while language differences can be used as a part of reactionary nationalism they are rarely if ever the focal point, if you look at ultranationalist groups and their rhetoric throughout history they rarely talk about language, instead focusing on things like race, culture and history to push their narratives.\n\nThis is because language and ethnicity are not correlated. For example look at the current racism against Arabs in both France and Britain, 99% of Arabs speak the language of whichever country they're living in but yet there is still a divide in how society treats them vs the white majority and that's cause you do not often find situations where language is the main juxtaposition between two groups of people (Only really in situations of colonisation and imperialism).\n\nThis brings me to my next point, Marxist theory if anything is pro minority languages because as we've established earlier the question of language is a much harder thing to attach to reactionary nationalist ideals than race and others.

And with regards to to your second point you're not quite correct, it wasn't as simple as the neolithic = patriarchy, for example the neolithic societies in the Danube Valley that practiced sedentary agriculture are believed to have been relatively ambivalent to the idea of gender roles. \n\nWhere the change of neolithic patriarchy occurs is with the introduction of the pastoral economy to the European steppe, which was a harsh and forgiving place where sedentary settlements are not very doable outside of river valleys, in environments like these bands of brothers very often end up setting out together which kind of leads to a glorified martial raiding culture, where men would go out and capture cattle and other livestock to be used as ritual currency in their society and earn them prestige.\n\nAnd it's important to remember that prestige started off with the livestock themselves which were used largely for ritualistic purposes rather than food consumption (ie a luxury item for wealthy people to afford) and then transferred to those in society who would procure said livestock in raids, ie the aforementioned men, moving their society towards a more rigid patriarchy", "created_utc": "1653305728.0", "edited": "False", "id": "i9o79ab", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_uvw4sw", "parent_id": "t1_i9o4cv3", "score": "12", "subreddit": "EnoughPCMSpam", "subreddit_id": "t5_4cqlyg"}, {"author": "Fear_mor", "body": "Learners don't make a language grow unless they're actively taking part in a speech community.

Is he really in favour of environmentalism, sure he owns tesla, a brand of electric cars, but if we examine how he operates said brand its very clear that what he says is just lip service. Tesla creates millions of tons of just cobalt waste alone, that poisons the land of developing countries, hindering agriculture and exposing workers to dangerous amounts of toxic compounds that shorten their lifespan and damage the environment.\n\nWhen it comes to Musk's infrastructure projects they have the same problem, they're all just futurist dog whistles to provide lip service that he's doing things when in reality most of his projects are more expensive, less efficient versions of things that already exist. Remember his idea for the Vegas hyperloop that as of right now is just a glorified subway that uses cars instead of a train, much less efficient than an acc subway in terms of emissions, travel time, capacity and space.\n\nAnd is Musk really pro free speech? Or pro free speech for people he agrees with? My mind instantly goes back to the time he cancelled a journalists tesla order because they wrote a negative opinion piece about him and his industry practices.

Due to the system of consonant mutation in place it's acc very common for initial consonants to change their value, for example in my dialect \"cr\u00edoch\" is said with an initial /t\u02b2/ due the merging of /x\u027e\u02e0/ and /h\u027e\u02e0/ to [\u027e\u0325\u02e0], meaning that \"chr\u00edoch\" and \"thr\u00edoch\", lenited forms, sound identical, allowing for the shift from /c/ to /t\u02b2/. \n\nIf you really want an example of un-etymological /p/ specifically, have a look at Scots Gaelic piuthar /p\u02b0ju.\u0259\u027e/ from O.Ir \"siur\" via the lenited form \"fiur\" (whence dated Irish \"si\u00far\" /\u0255u:\u027e\u02e0/).
