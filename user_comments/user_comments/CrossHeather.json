And just keep increasing the difficulty bit by bit\u2026 it soon adds up!\n\nSo reading has been the main \u2018keystone\u2019 activity. It\u2019d be wrong to say it was 100% the reason for my success but the % will be high. I saw a lot from people like Stephen Krashen online saying extensive reading of fiction was the best way to boost your vocabulary so that\u2019s what I\u2019ve been doing for the most part. Unless I say otherwise below I usually only look up words if I really want to because I think I need to know it for the benefit of understanding the story, or the word comes up a few times in a row. I find it really helps me be comfortable with not understanding every single word when listening and gets me used to understanding the gyst of what is being said.\n\nAll throughout I dabbled with Anki but have completely scrapped it now. It feels like reading a lot is more useful to me. \n\nI feel like the main benefit of immersing in native materials is the fact that - once you are comfortable with them - its hard to ever get bored. If you find something you enjoy then then motivation is never a factor. On my worst days of 'studying Italian' I'll have read a chapter of a book and listened to some Italian while walking or driving. \n\nMonth 1\n\nI started off with 2 of Ollie Richards' short stories for beginners books. They aren\u2019t fantastic, but they do have notes on \u2018how to read\u2019 (which sounds daft, but it\u2019s actually quite useful to get you into extensive reading) and it\u2019s easy enough to get the audiobooks which obviously help with learning pronunciation. Essentially I would read a chapter without looking anything up, check the vocab list, then read through again looking up every word I didn\u2019t know using a Kindle Italian to English dictionary. Just to consolidate everything, I\u2019d read through one more time without looking anything up unless I really needed to. I also listened to the audiobook versions (I think the 1st book twice and the 2nd book once).\n\nAt the same time I decided I was going to intensively read though a non fiction book (turns out these are easier than novels after all) and \u2018gold list\u2019 every new word. I gave up on this halfway through the 2nd book I was trying this with and never came back to it! (You should be able to google 'Goldlisting' easily enough, but I don't think its worthwhile with the existence of Anki.)\n\nI watched a little bit of Netflix with spoken Italian and Italian subtitles as well.\n\nMonth 2(ish)\n\nAfter the Ollie Richards books I was pretty certain I never wanted to read a learners short story ever again \ud83d\ude02 I started reading Roald Dahl books (I\u2019d read a lot of his books as a kid and liked them, so it was a nice nostalgia blast). I\u2019d read a chapter in Italian, then in English, then in Italian again. I only needed to do this for the first few chapters of two of these books (The Twits and Fantastic Mr Fox), and since then I\u2019ve never had to use any other method than \u2018look up words\u2019 to read a book. I also listened to audiobooks of these when possible (normally while walking or driving, and always after I'd read the book).\n\nTowards the end of this month I decided to book a once a week lesson. At this stage I was pretty much at a point where reading off a script was the only way to keep talking for any length of time, so I\u2019d normally watch a ted x video before the lesson, and then use Microsoft Excel to write a report on it, putting a sentence of English in one column, and get a translation in another column to read out. I found this a good way to ask a native speaker how good the translations were (surprisingly they were usually very good!)\n\nMonth 3(ish) to 4(ish)\n\nAt this point I decided I wanted to move on from Roald Dahl books to books \u2018YA fiction\u2019 (The Curious incident of the dog in the night time, Harry Potter and the Hunger Games). I just read these without using any other technique than looking up words if I really wanted to know it. I eventually settled on a system of having one book on the kindle app (where I\u2019ll look up words quite a bit some days if I feel like it) and a paperback which I read before bed (where I hardly ever look up a word). I did also read a couple of non fiction books at this stage. Its something I will eventually go back to as I prefer non fiction, but I'm focused on boosting my vocabulary.\n\nI also wanted to branch out from only listening to audiobooks so I started listening to YouTubers aimed at learners (so they talk only in Italian but with the fact they are talking to learners in mind). Podcast Italiano is a good example.\n\nInspired by things I was learning from my weekly lessons I started looking up grammar. I read though a 'Teach Yourself' Italian grammar book and started looking up verb conjugations on Reverso. This all made much more sense than any grammar study I\u2019ve done in the past due to the reading I\u2019d been doing. Rather than trying to memorise things it became \u2018ohhh that\u2019s what that means\u2019. It\u2019s hard to explain how powerful that is \ud83d\ude42\n\nMonth 5 onwards\n\nFor reading I decided I wanted to keep upping the level so started reading novels aimed at an adult audience (nothing literary but things like Lee Child, Stephen King etc). I\u2019ve just started my first novel which was originally written in Italian and the first 2 chapters have been fine \ud83d\ude42 I\u2019ll listen to audiobooks of them after I\u2019ve read them. That way if I zone out I don\u2019t get lost as I\u2019ve read the story before.\n\nTowards the end of month 4 I found I was understanding most of the things I was watching on Netflix with subs on so I started watching things without the subs on and branching out to YouTubers who were aimed at a native audience. I can now understand a lot of what I listen to but it was tough until very recently. Because novels use a lot more words than real life talking I think I\u2019m starting to understand the theory that reading is what reaches you the vocabulary and listening/watching tv is the \u2018reward\u2019. I\u2019ve also started buying DVDs and have watched a couple of films without subs.  \n\nI decided that my main weakness was verb conjugation (which is pretty much the key to expressing the correct tense and person in both Italian and Spanish I believe). So I know put a random verb into reverso\u2019s conjugator and test myself on the different conjugations. This has worked amazingly well at improving my speaking.\n\nAt around the start of month 5 I could have conversation with my tutor, understanding everything she said and she could understand me perfectly etc.\n\nI think that\u2019s everything. I hope it wasn\u2019t too much, but I wanted to try and give everything useful I\u2019ve done!", "created_utc": "1658769734.0", "edited": "1658771995.0", "id": "ihlou1b", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_w7ajfv", "parent_id": "t1_ihlgkmj", "score": "1", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "CrossHeather", "body": "Loads of people saying similar, but thought I\u2019d add for more encouragement as you won\u2019t be the only person thinking this\u2026 I\u2019m 36 (soon to be 37) and have progressed from false beginner in Italian to being able to have a conversation for an hour, being able to read novels and listen to most things etc in 6 months mostly through reading a lot, and listening more and more as my comfort levels grew.\n\nThe problem is we convince ourselves it\u2019s too difficult to learn a language because we learned a language at school and never became fluent. Then we tried to replicate the same learning methods, or used a couple of apps etc, and we\u2019re even more convinced learning languages just isn\u2019t for us.\n\nThe frustration for me now is if I\u2019d just known that \u2018reading a lot\u2019 was so effective (and how obvious is it really?

Since it was constructed with a**n** **everyday** activity ~~that it\u2019s done by everyone~~, the act of eating, it slightly\\* amplified the gloomy atmosphere of the frame, turning\\* it into a raw and visceral one. After all, when I think about eating, the image that pops into my mind is usually happy ones, where people are enjoying eating together or at least tasting something **delicious**. Who **could** imagine that two people eating eggs would be so depressing and sad?\n\n*\\*('subtly' is probably better than 'slightly'. Subtly implies that it was used well)* \n\n\r\\* You said this only 'slightly' amplifed the gloomy atmostphere, so the thought that this turns the entire scene is a contradiction. \"turning\\* it into a raw and visceral one.\"  would probably be better as \"amplyifing the raw and visceral nature of the moment\"\n\n\r  \nThe first aspect that I want to talk about is regarding the incapacity of them in moving on and expressing their feeling toward others. As I mentioned their lives were difficult and they have so much distress about it, life had coarsened them and they weren\u2019t willing to accept and live new experiences, only living in the past. But, after this scene is really difficult for me to agree totally with that. Although they were living together because they don\u2019t have another place to go, I think they turned into a family. It\u2019s not a family that they want, but was a family that they needed and deep inside, they all have nurtured some kind of fond feeling toward each of them. Since they are all incapable of showing emotions, this scene was the emotional outlet that they needed, the only way that they have found to communicate it and was also the way that was used to avoid dealing with it too. Unfortunately, for this display of affection happens, the departure of their friends was needed.\r  \n\r  \nAnd it gets deeper because I think everyone can relate with this somehow. How many times did you avoid something because you were afraid to be criticized? How many times did you worry about doing something because you didn\u2019t know how would be the reactions of others? How many times did you shirk something because you thought that would be plenty of time in the future to do that? How many times did you fudge an opportunity because you are feeling insecure? This can be quite dangerous because maybe tomorrow could be too late, as shown in this scene.\r  \n\r  \nThe second part that I want to delve into is that Spike is such a disingenuous person when he states \u201cWhatever happens, happens\u201d to everyone, that life is this and that and you should accept it, but he is the one who doesn\u2019t forget what has happened. For me, the person that represents this philosophy is Ed, and it\u2019s easy to make this association. He\u2019s always happy and always living in the present, and never letting the awful things lock up the good mood and embroiling his soul in bad feelings. And when he needs to move on, he simply does, as well as he did when he left the crew to be with his beloved father.\r  \n\r  \nTo be cointinued...", "created_utc": "1657967658.0", "edited": "False", "id": "igdo4ih", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_w04aio", "parent_id": "t3_w04aio", "score": "2", "subreddit": "WriteStreakEN", "subreddit_id": "t5_2y42lo"}, {"author": "CrossHeather", "body": "*Wotsit", "created_utc": "1657950755.0", "edited": "False", "id": "igd223b", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_vzx0ly", "parent_id": "t1_igb10r7", "score": "2", "subreddit": "unitedkingdom", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhqb"}, {"author": "CrossHeather", "body": "Grazie!\n\nQuesto feedback \u00e8 molto utile!", "created_utc": "1657899774.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ig9ylin", "is_submitter": "True", "link_id": "t3_vy7ikv", "parent_id": "t1_ig94xgd", "score": "1", "subreddit": "WriteStreakIT", "subreddit_id": "t5_2gcnah"}, {"author": "CrossHeather", "body": "Yes, lots of good pointers here, but this comment is why having audio to go along with what you are reading is pretty much essential at the beginning. \n\nObviously it can be done without the audio\u2026 people would have had to cope without it in the past after all.

For example, let\u2019s say somebody learning English decided to watch a London gangster film and start calling me \u2018blud\u2019 and \u2018fam\u2019. I think I\u2019d throw up on their shoes if they didn\u2019t have a cockney accent. In fact they\u2019d sound like a complete moron to me even if they did have a cockney accent. And just to prove how dangerous the whole slang thing is, I\u2019m basically referring to cockneys being from the entirety of London which is fine in my home town, but would make somebody from \u2018darn sarf\u2019 spontaneously combust from pure rage because my use of \u2018cockney\u2019 is actually not that which is defined in the dictionary. (I think the actual definition is \u2018A person that can watch Eastenders without wanting to throw themselves off a balcony\u2019)\n\nThe random knowledge you need to use slang properly just isn\u2019t worth it. For example, someone from the north west of England might call their friends \u2018soft lad\u2019, but wouldn\u2019t say it to a random person from a different town because they know the other person would be completely bewildered by the phrase. And what gain are they really getting from using the term \u2018soft lad\u2019?\n\nAnd finally, being funny in English is easy. Just insult people. The more friendly with someone you are, the more you are allowed to insult them. The more insulting the comment, the funnier it is. (Disclaimer: I can only speak for the UK.

I imagine a good chunk of that 4% would have been cashed in by that point anyway as people start doing a modern day version of a bank run on Tether. There will of course be quite a few wealthy people/instituations willing to risk holding the bag while this is going on also, who would start snapping Tether up at 90c on the $, then 80c  etc.\n\nCertainly not fud to be sceptical of Tether, but certainly wouldn't use it as a reason to change my long term view of crypto. Its just evidence that we are still very much in the wild west days of this, and you need to be exceptionally careful who you trust. And definitely worth considering getting rid of Tether if you hold it, I certainly wouldn't keep hold of it thinking 'well if this goes to 0, everything goes to 0' as that just isn't true.", "created_utc": "1623935297.0", "edited": "False", "id": "h232o0c", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_o1fuw4", "parent_id": "t3_o1fuw4", "score": "1", "subreddit": "CryptoCurrency", "subreddit_id": "t5_2wlj3"}, {"author": "CrossHeather", "body": "Yes the vehicle to property % would be interesting.
