It's really the fanbase outside of Japan (or to be more precise the MGS/SH fanbase) that's getting the short end of the stick. (It should be note here too that while Kojima is well beloved outside of Japan, Japanese gamers doesn't share that same reverence. Which is why I don't think Konami will \"regret\" letting Kojima go, simply because both themselves and their main target audience simply just doesn't interest in the guy's work that much)\n\nWhat make all this interesting is that Konami's switch to focus on \"Japan first\" coincide with the time Japanese console game industry in general (and especially AAA) become increasingly dependent on the foreign market (case in point: Tales of Arise sold quite poorly in Japan but made up for it by foreign sales). And all the more interesting is that Konami simply doesn't get punished for that decision, profit has been increasing year after year, with 2022 being their most profitable year ever and even in their worse year they still made more profit than they ever did when they still have Kojima and make AAA games. Fascinating stuff, really\n\nAs for the whole BEMANI SOUND TEAM thing, my impression is that it's less of something especially awful and more of Konami taking a page from what other companies already doing (iirc Taito credit their in house in Groove Coaster as \\[Artist name\\]\\(Zuntata\\), Namco doesn't even bother doing that in Taiko and all their in house are pretty much Namco Sound Team or something, although they did credit them in OST releases so at least there's that).

Other than that, there isn't really any differences between LN and \"regular\" novel, and plenty of writers either started with LN and then move to regular novels or writing both at the same time. And then you have something like the Monogatari series that was published under both label iirc. So with that in mind, no there isn't really any English equivalent.\n\nAs for recommendation for more adult-ish setting (not necessarily middle-aged theme but idk) LNs, well I haven't read any of them *yet* but there are a few of these that I'm interested in reading: [\u307c\u304f\u305f\u3061\u306e\u30ea\u30e1\u30a4\u30af](https://www.amazon.co.jp/-/en/dp/B06XRRJQGP/?coliid=I2AGXUU1GDU2HW) (and especially its [spinoff](https://www.amazon.co.jp/-/en/dp/B07WGB6V3J/?coliid=I4Q9LCVXB0YVM) which do sound like something you would want to read), [\u7d50\u5a5a\u304c\u524d\u63d0\u306e\u30e9\u30d6\u30b3\u30e1](https://www.amazon.co.jp/-/en/dp/B083WFH5GJ/?coliid=I1V9W0J7SXR7LJ), if you can tolerate a bit more otaku-ish stuff, something like [\u59b9\u3055\u3048\u3044\u308c\u3070\u3044\u3044](https://www.amazon.co.jp/-/en/%E5%B9%B3%E5%9D%82%E8%AA%AD-ebook/dp/B00UWUE0YA) might be interesting to you as well.", "created_utc": "1645528654.0", "edited": "1645528864.0", "id": "hxy9uxx", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_sy71j7", "parent_id": "t3_sy71j7", "score": "11", "subreddit": "LearnJapanese", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qyls"}, {"author": "panpanIIDX", "body": "Well I like to think that if learning grammar with a textbook or a grammar guide/dictionary (I would also add learning vocab through something like anki into this group as well) is like open a programming language tutorial to learn its syntax. Then the equivalent of building a personal project for learning natural language would be like learning through talking with native speakers and reading/watching/listening native materials. Just like how in building a program or an app, you use the programming language to do what you want it to do and then if you have any issue or don't know something, you google it and you learn the language that way. Same thing here, if you are talking or reading or watching something, you are basically using the language to do what you want to do (which is speaking or reading, etc.) and if you have any problem, you could either ask the person you are talking with (if you are talking), or google/open a dictionary if you encounter something you don't know and you keep learning that way.\n\nIf there's one thing that's different compare to learning programming language though is that with programming language, you only need to know the syntax of the language you are learning before you start building something. With natural languages, you'll want a hefty vocab base (around a few hundreds to around 2-3000 depend on language) before you speaking with a native speaker or reading native materials become really effective. Moreover, programming languages are much more similar to each other compare to natural languages. So for these reasons, progress in learning natural language will be much slower compare to progress in learning programming languages.\n\nThat said, much like learning programming, assuming you are consistent enough (ie using Anki 15 minutes everyday and/or maybe 30 mins of learning grammar and reading/watching something in your target language everyday once you got to that point and so on), then you will inevitably make progress.", "created_utc": "1645450903.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hxtwnou", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_sxds3n", "parent_id": "t3_sxds3n", "score": "0", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "panpanIIDX", "body": "\"So no, you are not going to be fluent in Uzbek 40 days from now.\" - 5:50\n\nUnsubbed", "created_utc": "1645371157.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hxpnrfj", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_switx5", "parent_id": "t3_switx5", "score": "11", "subreddit": "languagelearningjerk", "subreddit_id": "t5_37rt5"}, {"author": "panpanIIDX", "body": "I like how you found kanji/hanzi impossible then proceed to choose Mandarin which is 100% kanji/hanzi over Korean (little to no kanji, similar grammar to Japanese though) or Vietnamese (no kanji whatsoever, use latin alphabet *and* similar grammar to Mandarin/English).\n\nBut more importantly, not learning the writing system is not really an option, even if you only want to speak. The reasoning is that while technically, you could say, memorize certain phrases and then start speaking. Long term improvement will come from lots of native input, be it from reading, watching native media with or without subtitles or listening to native conversations. By not learning the writing system, you basically close yourself out 2 of them as an option.\n\nFinally, kanji, especially their readings, is annoying, and that's true, but the thing is that if you say, learn kanji as a part of say, the first 6000 common words (which you should do anyways, learn the words I mean), with an SRS followed by lots of native input then it became little more than mild annoyance really quick.

Reading your first book/visual novel/whatever is painful as anyone would tell you, even the people who got to N1 within 2 years.

In fact, you are already doing it since at say JLPT N5 there simply aren't a lot of stuff are easily comprehensible. Now, it's not exactly the most pleasant experience as you already found out.\n\nThe other kind of reading, extensive reading, from personal experience, you can generally start doing it at N3 (or even N4 if it was some easy graded readers or easy native materials) and after knowing around 2-3k words (and probably already read a few things intensively) through Anki or the aforementioned intensive reading.\n\nIf I were you, I would continue doing intensive reading (how much time per day you decide, I'll probably say around 15 mins to an hour per day) while continue vocabulary and grammar study until you know around 3k words then you could start trying extensive reading something like easy novels (ie slice-of-life light novels or something like Kitchen, etc.).\n\n(Now intensive and extensive reading is some broad generalization as in practice your reading tend to be somewhere in-between, ie intensive reading for most of a blog article but reading extensively some easy paragraph or extensive reading most of a novel but looking up some word or grammar for a few sentences, etc. But you get the idea)", "created_utc": "1644903496.0", "edited": "1644903822.0", "id": "hx03jow", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_ssczr8", "parent_id": "t3_ssczr8", "score": "1", "subreddit": "LearnJapanese", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qyls"}, {"author": "panpanIIDX", "body": "Well the interviewed guy probably can pass N2 with some preparations, that said he mostly did other stuff outside of Duolingo (iirc Core6k deck plus lots of immersion and sentence mining)", "created_utc": "1644759232.0", "edited": "1644760310.0", "id": "hwrxe9o", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_srcm6j", "parent_id": "t1_hwr1j9i", "score": "5", "subreddit": "LearnJapanese", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qyls"}, {"author": "panpanIIDX", "body": "Well in the case of Kanji, you either learn them along with vocabs, and therefore it's already included in the vocabulary list.
