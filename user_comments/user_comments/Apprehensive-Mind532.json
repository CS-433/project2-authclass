Based mostly off the fact that I knew there would be enough resources, both while learning and once I achieve fluency there'll be plenty of interesting material to consume. So I took 3 trial lessons, one for each language, that happened to be on the same day. I ruled out Mandarin Chinese, I know I'd never master the tones and having to memorize all the characters seemed like very tedious low ROI study. I opted for German because it appealed to me the most. About 2 weeks in I discover that in addition to having 3 genders, there was also this thing called grammatical cases! I ran away screaming (ok, maybe not quite literally...). So I tried Spanish for a while. After 6 weeks of Spanish I realised I was bored, I felt more attached to German even though I'd barely got my toes wet. And I realised that this interest was the thing that was going to help motivate me through the hard parts. I still struggle with cases, but I've made great strides with my German comprehension.\n\nIn your case I would choose German because you have a genuine interest in it. And already knowing other languages will come in handy because, unlike me, you already know how you learn languages. There is a romance influence in German too that I discovered when I returned.\n\nJust FYI: German kinda frontloads the grammar, so you learn the tricky stuff very early, then the rest of it's pretty simple.
