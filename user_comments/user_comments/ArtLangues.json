They don't often tend to correct pronunciation, but they have told me that it's because I make very few small pronunciation mistakes in the first place, so it would be too nitpicky.\n\n>How do you work on your pronounciation at a high level?\n\nAt a high level, I only really need to do that with French (too complicated compared to ES/IT) and I do it by reading long C1-level texts out loud, sometimes with tutors and sometimes on my own.\n\n>What do you do before, during and after the lesson to maximise the learning effect? Do you take notes and/or record the lessons?\n\nBefore the lesson, I try to warm up by reading a text out loud or watching some videos in the target language to get my mind in the right \"language headspace\". During the lesson, I don't take notes myself, but the teacher writes them in a little box so I can refer to them later, and I don't tend to record the lessons.

Why or why not?\n\nI certainly feel like I will phase it out in the future, as long as I'm living in France, seeing as I have opportunities for immersion everywhere.

The problems mainly surfaced from Spanish and Italian, because I found myself replacing some Italian words with their closely related Spanish equivalent vocabulary, seeing as Spanish was the stronger language at the time. This problem went away with time once I started using Italian more often, and eventually, my brain had no problems with it.\n\nThe way I've been practicing the three is also different because I live in France and am studying Italian as my major at university. I learn French in an environmental setting, Italian in an educational setting, and Spanish in a home setting, so that's really helped to distinguish between them as well.\n\nFinally, I found that I progressed in French and Italian quickly, both in comprehension and production, due to the fact that they share similar vocabulary, of course.

One common theme on Reddit is that people read posts saying \"I got to X level in X time!\" and think that if they put in the exact same amount of hours, they'll get the exact same results. However, the amount of time needed to get to a level will always vary depending on how the person learns, and some will retain information faster than others. The type of resource and input also matters, and copying other people's study plan rather than your own can lead to little progress because it's not tailored to you, it's tailored to someone else.\n\nThis is a trend you'll see on every similar thread in, say, places like r/languagelearning \\- people attempting to follow exactly in another user's footsteps and failing. Reddit in general can also be very boasty and over-exaggerating their level (not that that's what you're doing of course since you have your proof, the exam) and lead people to think they'll make progress in a short amount of time.\n\nSo for anyone who's reading this, absolutely take inspiration from this guy (gal?), but make sure to individualize your study plans rather than simply taking them from Reddit because there's nearly a 100% chance that it won't be as effective for you.", "created_utc": "1610420516.0", "edited": "False", "id": "giykkn5", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_kvd2cl", "parent_id": "t3_kvd2cl", "score": "92", "subreddit": "German", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qq51"}, {"author": "ArtLangues", "body": "Can we also post there for bachelor's degree programs in Europe that aren't in English?

(what are the odds?!) I can answer your second question to the best of my ability since I've already finished everything that can be done at this time period, though we're both in the same boat.\n\nWhether or not you need a test really depends on what you're planning on studying exactly, but most of the time, the subject matter can be proven with your high school transcript (or are sometimes available for \"tout d\u00e9butants\"). For example, I'm entering LEA English-Italian, and seeing as we do not have Italian as a subject in most high schools in the US, I have to take a CILS B1 exam first (while the average French person applying to the same licence will likely have taken Italian in school and doesn't need it). You'll want to contact the university that has your degree and ask what high school prerequisites are required to enter that specific formation, but for most things, our high schools are similar enough to those of France that our basic common core (or equivalent) courses are fine.\n\nAs for the DELF B2, most (if not all) common French unis only require a B2 level for licence (3 years). You will only be asked to present a DALF C1 (or equivalent) in your studies after the licence. An \\*alternative\\* to the DELF for the first year is taking a TCF-DAP, but since you already have the DELF B2, you don't need that at all. No more language tests are necessary unless your uni explicitly states you need a higher level, which is usually not the case.\n\nYou do need a CV on your Etudes on France if you haven't already done so, though you seem aware of that. Also seems like you have the translated documents thing under control, I ordered from ACS Traduction\n\nOne thing that really helps is having a letter of recommendation. They strongly recommend American students applying to have at least one LOR. I would recommend that you get one from the non-profit you work for.\n\nAll of the absolute essential documents are on the Etudes en France application, because that's its purpose, to be simpler for the EEF country applicants. Follow the rules on the EEF and you're golden. Just don't forget to get a passport soon if you don't already have one, they are being a little delayed by the pandemic.\n\nOh, and here's an extra tidbit - if you're planning on getting money from family/others in the US for your studies in France, you'll open a French bank account under the university you're accepted to, but they will likely have to send money to you with something like Western Union because the French banks take a large chunk of money from foreign transfers based on what I've heard from other foreign students studying in France", "created_utc": "1602035479.0", "edited": "False", "id": "g7ymdo8", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_j69700", "parent_id": "t3_j69700", "score": "2", "subreddit": "IWantOut", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r5hw"}, {"author": "ArtLangues", "body": "I got PrivateVPN and it immediately worked with no issues, thank you!", "created_utc": "1601249430.0", "edited": "False", "id": "g6wfmb4", "is_submitter": "True", "link_id": "t3_j0kcn5", "parent_id": "t1_g6v2s7r", "score": "2", "subreddit": "NetflixViaVPN", "subreddit_id": "t5_3fzk2"}, {"author": "ArtLangues", "body": "1.
