Issues with the gut can lead to panic attacks, and Covid has been notoriously attacking our healthy bacteria in our gut. In the theory of viral persistence, the virus finds a way to persist in the gut. COVID-19 infection also attacks the limbic system and the limbic system controls and can trigger anxiety. I ended up realizing that I was getting severe adrenaline rushes that would lead to inappropriate sinus tachycardia, nausea and dizziness. As a result I would obviously start panicking as anybody would. But I think the main thing that we need to note about panic attacks as we traditionally know them is that sometimes they are purely psychological, whereas in the case of COVID-19, there are often physical triggers to these so-called panic attacks, not only psychological.\n\nPROPANOLOL was the only thing which worked for me to reduce my HR and calm these adrenaline dumps. I no longer take it because i have low BP and it\u2019s not good for me. Focus on your diet, eliminate all caffeine, alcohol and sugar. All of these things are extremely inflammatory, and will affect your mental health at this time. Make sure that you\u2019re getting enough sleep if you don\u2019t have any fatigue, exercise really helps with mental health. Additionally, look into gut dysbiosis, the gut-brain axis theory is very real. COVID attacks your gut, and can cause fight or flight response.

Issues with the gut can lead to panic attacks, and Covid has been notoriously attacking our healthy bacteria in our gut. In the theory of viral persistence, the virus finds a way to persist in the gut. COVID-19 infection also attacks the limbic system and the limbic system controls and can trigger anxiety. I ended up realizing that I was getting severe adrenaline rushes that would lead to inappropriate sinus tachycardia, nausea and dizziness. As a result I would obviously start panicking as anybody would. But I think the main thing that we need to note about panic attacks as we traditionally know them is that sometimes they are purely psychological, whereas in the case of COVID-19, there are often physical triggers to these so-called panic attacks, not only psychological.", "created_utc": "1663390883.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ioret22", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_xg2qhf", "parent_id": "t3_xg2qhf", "score": "3", "subreddit": "covidlonghaulers", "subreddit_id": "t5_2wizt3"}, {"author": "minivatreni", "body": "I drink homemade kefir every day due to gut dysbiosis caused by COVID, but I had a recent breakout due to upping the dosage of one of my topical acne creams, and they wanted to minimize the inflammation with antibiotics.", "created_utc": "1663387950.0", "edited": "False", "id": "iora3j5", "is_submitter": "True", "link_id": "t3_xg6b7a", "parent_id": "t1_ior9tw6", "score": "1", "subreddit": "covidlonghaulers", "subreddit_id": "t5_2wizt3"}, {"author": "minivatreni", "body": ">La Roche Posay Hydrating Gentle Cleanser\n\nIt burns my skin when I used it while on tret, no idea why :( I wanted to love it.

Many many people are getting misdiagnosed with anxiety while longhauling, so i think it's important to create awareness that it's not just anxiety, and that longhauling is real, so many doctors are quick to give this false diagnosis.\n\nAlso, in this case her sister did have a brain tumor which was causing all those issues, but the main reason I posted it was because as soon as the doctor and neurologist found out she recently had COVID, they immediately said she must have some severe anxiety disorder.
