One diver got squeezed like toothpaste through a partially open door just 60cm wide, with his internal organs being forced out of his chest cavity, whilst others experienced such trauma that their blood boiled and fat was found in their arteries and heart because the rapid gas buildup in their system forced it out of solution. \n\n  Blobfish and similar creatures have a particular physiology which has adapted to the massive pressures and general conditions of that depth, which makes it even worse when they experience the rapid pressure changes upon being removed from the sea.

Basically nitrogen bubbles start to form in the blood and also your body tissues, causing symptoms including confusion, dizziness, muscle aches and spasms, body rash and hallucinations. Severe cases can result in paralysis (sometimes permanent) and death. \n\nThe main cause for divers at least is when they\u2019re coming up to the surface too fast from a deep depth (I believe it\u2019s anything past 20m). It\u2019s for this reason that divers typically use a set ascent rate (18m/minute is the usual maximum), dive computers will have sensors for detecting depth and ascent (and you\u2019re meant to check this when diving), and also have an alarm when the ascent is too fast (mine makes a loud continuous bleeping sound). Also, it\u2019s typical practice for divers to do decompression stops at set depths to allow the nitrogen to disperse. Tech divers (the ones who go down really far) and recreational divers who plan to do deep dives will also use different gas mixtures like nitrox (a different mix of oxygen and nitrogen) or Trimix (a mixture of nitrogen, oxygen and helium).\n\nSource: I\u2019m a diver.", "created_utc": "1657945788.0", "edited": "False", "id": "igcu2jh", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_vzrudx", "parent_id": "t1_igbaiei", "score": "15", "subreddit": "HermanCainAward", "subreddit_id": "t5_35e6ns"}, {"author": "Meanttobepracticing", "body": "Yeah I love copperheads but would be giving that snake all the room in the world.", "created_utc": "1657944724.0", "edited": "False", "id": "igcs7h8", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_w00am2", "parent_id": "t1_igc10zz", "score": "7", "subreddit": "snakes", "subreddit_id": "t5_2ryfw"}, {"author": "Meanttobepracticing", "body": "I moved to Vietnam and it was a shock going to my first ever Vietnamese Mass where there were so many people, the church had outside seating, awnings to keep the sun off people\u2019s heads and massive courtyards full of statues and shrines. \n\nAlso a shock was seeing people at weekday Mass at 4.30am!

They eat other snakes and are good for the local environment. \n\nSnake venom isn\u2019t just one type of liquid, it\u2019s different depending on the snake it can affect your blood, cells of your body or your nerves. Some snakes have venom which is a mix of these. \n\nRattlesnake rattles are made up of little rings. The rattlesnake can vibrate this very fast, from 50-100 times a minute. \n\nThere existed an ancient and giant snake type called a titanoboa. They were 12-14m long (we think) and weighed over a ton. \n\nGaboon vipers are one of the most venomous snakes in the world. They\u2019re also a snake that doesn\u2019t move in an S shape, they can move in a straight line like a caterpillar. \n\n\nIf you\u2019re in the USA and see a snake with a pattern on it that looks like Hershey\u2019s Kisses, it\u2019s probably a copperhead snake. They\u2019re highly venomous but if left alone will not cause a problem. They\u2019re useful because they will eat pests like rats and other snakes. \n\nVenomous snakes are venomous from birth. People think they\u2019re less dangerous because they\u2019re just babies but this is wrong. \n\nAnimals like the mongoose and honey badger are famous because they will hunt and eat venomous snakes. \n\nPeople sometimes keep venomous snakes as pets. They\u2019re often called \u2018hots\u2019 keepers. In the US some states don\u2019t ask you to have a licence for these snakes, but some do. It is different in every state. You also need to be trained in how to look after them, and have special equipment and snake proofing. \n\nIn the UK we have the adder, which is venomous but not a threat to people. They are very rare so seeing one is difficult. \n\nThe reason that many venomous snakes have fat looking cheeks or faces is because that\u2019s where their venom glands are. These are like small bags where the venom is made, and then it goes out through the fangs. \n\nSnakes can be fixed fanged (the fang stays down like our teeth) or can be movable and come down when needed.

I did the PADI Open Water Diver course and there are usually three parts: \n\n* theory learning and test. This is basically a lot of reading and you will work your way through 5 modules covering equipment, basic techniques/dive planning and also emergency skills. The modules are broken down into small subsections where you just read them and then there is usually a small quiz at the end of a couple of multiple choice questions to practice everything. Once you\u2019ve completed all the modules you can then take the final exam. This is timed (you have one hour) and the pass mark is 75%. As long as you read questions carefully then you should find this easy. \n\n  One thing to note is that some scuba diving schools might offer in person classes to do the theory over a couple of weeks or you can, like I did, opt for the e-learning version which you do through the PADI website. This is a popular option if you want to, for example, do the exam and then go on holiday to do the actual dives, or if like me you are good at self-study. \n\n* confined dives. This is where you\u2019ll see and use scuba equipment for the first time in the course and you will work with your instructor to learn how to set-up and use the gear, and also practice key skills you\u2019ll need in the water within the safety of the swimming pool. I worked with one other student diver and the instructor over the course of 2 days to do this part of the course. \n\n* certification dives. This is where you go out onto the sea and actually do dives in the sea. I did 4 dives over 2 days, one in the morning and one early afternoon. All the equipment I needed was provided by the dive school and all I had to do was basically show up. \n\n  During the course of the dives the instructors will get  you to repeat and practice some of the skills you did in the pool. Some of the big ones I remember doing a lot was equalization (getting rid of pressure in your ear to make sure you don\u2019t get an ear injury), buddy breathing (where you give air supply to your dive partner if they\u2019re out of air), water clearance from your mask (both for small amounts of water and also if your mask is completely full to the top) and also decompression stops (where you wait for a period to allow accumulated nitrogen in your system from going down to depth to start clearing) and monitoring your air supply via your gauges. \n\n  There are also skills that you can only really do in the sea, such as following a guideline down to the seabed,  navigation using a compass and assisting your dive buddy in navigation, using the dive computer to check depth and dive times and practicing buoyancy adjustment. You\u2019ll also, as the dive site allows, go down to a maximum depth of 18m, the maximum allowed depth. This seems like it\u2019s really deep but at least IMO it didn\u2019t seem like it. \n\n  \n  Once you do the dives and your instructor is happy you\u2019ve shown the skills, then you\u2019ll be certified as an open water diver and be free to go anywhere in the world that recognizes PADI certification (which is pretty much anywhere, including other scuba agencies such as SSI and also any other PADI school) and dive. \n\n  Feel free to come and say hi on /r/scuba if you\u2019ve got questions or just want an awesome subreddit community to talk to. :)", "created_utc": "1654618596.0", "edited": "1654638952.0", "id": "ibi39zt", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_v6r3bu", "parent_id": "t1_ibhl8j1", "score": "2", "subreddit": "AskUK", "subreddit_id": "t5_2t4s3"}, {"author": "Meanttobepracticing", "body": "I'm a scuba diver!
