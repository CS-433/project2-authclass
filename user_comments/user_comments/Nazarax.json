I was exposed to it through music and TV in my later childhood so I didn't actually learn to speak it but maybe I adapted to it in some way (many words sound familiar, and accents come naturally to me) and find learning it relatively easy and fun.   \nUkrainian - For years already I've wanted to learn an eastern european language which is written in cyrillic script, so it was either Russian or Ukrainian. At first Russian seemed as a more rational choice being more widespread and having much more available learning materials. However, as I was examining both languages I developed an interest for phonetics of Ukrainian language, and as I wanted to understand it better, started learning the language. Also, I realized that Ukrainian being less widespread may actually be an advantage - less learning materials and contents in general on the internet makes learning it more challenging and thus more fun; and I find it a more interesting choice since there are fewer foreigners who speak it or learn to speak it, so there is a factor of \"uniqueness\" to it.  \nGerman - I learned it in both primary and high school. In primary school I really disliked it and had no motivation at all. My parents insisted that I keep learning it in high school, but not as a school subject but extracurricular activity. I started liking the language but it seems that was not motivating enough to actually learn it.

I'm 25 M and lost my virginity at the age of 23, which is definitely later than average. I also had close to none romantic experiences with girls prior to that, mostly because of my negative attitude that I'm absolutely unattractive and that no girl in this world could ever think of me as a potential dating candidate, and even less so date me and have sex with me. There are a few advice I want to share with you based on my experience:\n\n1.  **Negative attitude** about yourself, self-loathing and self-depreciation can make you less attractive and much less likely to involve in any interaction that may lead you to dating/sex. If you struggle with this as well, it's the first thing you should work on. Those are delusions, and can be challenged and overcome. There is a saying: \"If you tell yourself that you can do it, or if you tell yourself you can't - in both cases you'll be right.\" And it's true.\n2. You should not worry that your **lack of experience** is bound to make you perform poorly in bed. My first sex was with an older (then 29) girl who was experienced and we both really enjoyed it. Even though it'll all be new to you, you have the skill and knowledge how to do it ingrained in yourself as you've gone through sexual development. And of course, even if it doesn't turn out perfect the first time, there is much room for improvement with practice and you are bound to get (even) better.\n3. You need to be **proactive** in order to get date/laid. I think that the cliche \"Don't worry about it, it'll just happen.\" is a bit false. You may have to get out of your shell and comfort zone if you are not very sociable, or you may have to hone your flirting skills (there is bunch of material on youtube that I consulted myself). But firstly, get out there, meet girls, socialize with them, and when you start to like a girl, flirt with her. If you are not particularly flirty (I know that I myself *definitely* am not) this may be hard in the beginning but practice makes perfect. If you worry how to meet girls there are plenty of options: college, study groups, libraries (I meet my first partner there), clubs, dating apps - whatever works for you.

For example, if you put milk in microwave oven, absorbed MW- radiation makes water molecules rotate more rapidly, thus increasing its internal energy. Higher its internal energy, higher the temperature. IR- radiation makes atoms in molecules vibrate more strongly (excites molecules to higher vibrational state) around their equilibrium position also increasing the temperature of body (this is why IR-lamps make you feel warm). Gamma or X- rays, for example, which have much larger frequency, have large enough energy to even kick electrons out of the molecules usually making them very unstable and reactive. If this happens in your body (if you are exposed to large amounts of ionizing radiation -  type of radiation that may cause this to happen), creation of such highly reactive species can damage some important biomolecules in your cells (e.g. DNA) and lead to cell death or cancer", "created_utc": "1522176550.0", "edited": "False", "id": "dwdlgt2", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_87jfro", "parent_id": "t3_87jfro", "score": "1", "subreddit": "explainlikeimfive", "subreddit_id": "t5_2sokd"}, {"author": "Nazarax", "body": "Whole roll of toilet paper, on multiple occasions.", "created_utc": "1522175456.0", "edited": "False", "id": "dwdk8g3", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_87k8ij", "parent_id": "t3_87k8ij", "score": "2", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i"}, {"author": "Nazarax", "body": "Around 12 years old small piece of bread that I made when I was on a school trip to country side.
