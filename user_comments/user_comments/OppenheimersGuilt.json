Announcement of the \r\nSouthern attack was broadcast over the North's radio later in the morning of the 25th. \r\nContrary to general belief at the time, no United Nations group\u2014neither the UN \r\nMilitary Observer Group in the field nor the UN Commission on Korea in Seoul\u2014\r\nwitnessed, or claimed to have witnessed, the outbreak of hostilities. The Observer\r\nGroup's field trip along the Parallel ended on 23 June. Its statements about what took \r\nplace afterward are either speculation or based on information received from the South \r\nKorean government or the US military. \r\nMoreover, early in the morning of the 26th, the South Korean Office of Public \r\nInformation announced that Southern forces had indeed captured the North Korean \r\ntown of Haeju. The announcement stated that the attack had occurred that same\r\nmorning, but an American military status report as of nightfall on the 25th notes that all \r\nSouthern territory west of the Imjin River had been lost to a depth of at least three miles\r\ninside the border except in the area of the Haeju \"counter attack\". \r\nIn either case, such a military victory on the part of the Southern forces is\r\nextremely difficult to reconcile with the official Western account, maintained to this \r\nday, that has the North Korean army sweeping south in a devastating surprise attack, \r\ntaking control of everything that lay before it, and forcing South Korean troops to \r\nevacuate further south. \r\nSubsequently, the South Korean government denied that its capture of Haeju had \r\nactually taken place, blaming the original announcement, apparently, on an \r\nexaggerating mili-taty officer. One historian has ascribed the allegedly incorrect \r\nannouncement to \"an error due to poor communications, plus an attempt to stiffen South \r\nKorean resistance by claiming a victory\". Whatever actually lay behind the \r\nannouncement, it is evident that very little reliance, if any, can be placed upon \r\nstatements made by the South Korean government concerning the start of the war.4\n\n\nPage 46\n\n> The head of South Korea, Syngman Rhee, had often expressed his desire and \r\nreadiness to compel the unification of Korea by force. On 26 June the New York Times \r\nreminded its readers that \"on a number of occasions, Dr. Rhee has indicated that his \r\narmy would have taken the offensive if Washington had given the consent.\" The\r\nnewspaper noted also that before the war began: \"The warlike talk strangely [had] \r\nalmost all come from South Korean leaders.\" \r\nRhee may have had good reason for provoking a full-scale war apart from the\r\nissue of unification. On 30 May, elections for the National Assembly were held in the \r\nSouth in which Rhee's party suffered a heavy setback and lost control of the assembly. \r\nLike countless statesmen before and after him, Rhee may have decided to play the war \r\ncard to rally support for his shaky rule. A labor adviser attached to the American aid \r\nmission in South Korea, Stanley Earl, resigned in July, expressing the opinion that the\r\nSouth Korean government was \"an oppressive regime\" which \"did very little to help the\r\npeople\" and that \"an internal South Korean rebellion against the Rhee Government\r\nwould have occurred if the forces of North Korea had not invaded\"\n\n\n\nSo, who invaded who?", "created_utc": "1665272956.0", "edited": "False", "id": "irkm295", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_xs1zr7", "parent_id": "t1_irkiapq", "score": "11", "subreddit": "stupidpol", "subreddit_id": "t5_hitz3"}, {"author": "OppenheimersGuilt", "body": "Don't bother my dude, I don't deny involvement, I just don't see this as one-sided.\n\nThose replying to me seem to believe Ukrainian armed forces did nothing wrong.

Not all of them are \"one side won\". In fact, usually it tends to happen because the conflict is proving costly to both sides, and whilst one might win, it could for all purposes be a Pyrrhic win.\n\nTake for example the Winter War, which you should be acquainted with being a Finn.  The Finns won a brave and outstanding defensive victory (yet not the war), but made the war painful enough that peace negotiations happened. And you guys should be proud of the fight you gave.\n\nNow, I think Ukraine is in a much better position to strike a much better deal, if I'm honest with you.\n\n> We are winning.\n\nWho's we?

I refuse to even consider the possibility of holding my little brother's lifeless corpse in my arms.\n\n> Taking land that has been taken from you is not aligned with \"nations sovereignty\"?

A lot of European territory has passed hands time and time again precisely due to concessions made in aims of peace treaties.\n\nAlso, asking for a decent track record is a bit too much. Some peace treaties last centuries, some last days. Hell, Minsk agreements both sides kept on attacking each other. \n\nIn any, do you really think a negotiation between the USA and Russia, or any country for that matter, is done via something so pathetic, from a geopolitical point of view, as _trust_?\n\nTrust doesn't really exist at that level.

I get a BJ from your wife and maybe one of the bedrooms.\n\nTalk about a false equivalence. Ironically, this precise example, embedded with such a dead-end is very similar to the one I was criticizing, itself a dead-end.\n\nMore precisely, if a robber came into my house and threatened my wife, and asked for everything I own and my house in return, he'd have it. _Of course he would_.\n\n> Note that Ukraine has not entered Russia proper at all. They have the ability AND absolutely have the right to do so, at least as good a right as the Soviet Union had to enter German territories in 1944. \n\nIf they did this they would, and should, lose Western support in a heartbeat. In fact, there have been some actions, curtailing of civilian liberties, refusals to uphold proper standards and other things that in my opinion should've at the minimum been dealt a warning, not a flurry of praise. \n\n> And why not reclaim the stolen lands?

I think the academic term for this is _multicentric_ (not multipolar). Countries will align on some issues (like energy) and oppose on other issues (like food or supporting allies) without there being two very clearly defined teams.\n\nThe dualistic Good Guys vs the Axis of Evil is giving way to an era of pragmatic grayscale, each nation putting its own interests first, aligning on specific issues as it suits them without that implying an actual faction. Morality here is little more than smokes and mirrors and propaganda narratives (**everyone** engages in propaganda).\n\nFor the Global South this represents a possible great opportunity. Case in point, the USA reversing its position on Venezuela (\"hey buddy can we talk about that black gold you've got? didn't mean to be so harsh on ya ;P\"), which as some economists say is triggering an investment rush in the country. A similar story for other countries of the Global South who weren't benefitting from the current unipolar US-dominated hegemony.\n\nFor Europe and the USA this _could_ possibly represent the end of an era, still a privileged position in the international stage, but no longer the same as it once was. Basically go the way of the British Empire, from dominating force to important player.

Even being an asshole is not as bad as being boring.\n\n4. Learn to tell stories. It ties in (3). One of the easiest shortcuts to being charming, aside from funny, is to be a good storyteller. \n\n5. Figure out what you want. For guys without much luck, they'll settle for anything that comes their way, sometimes getting into relationships where they're not happy, but they don't want to lose the one girl that gave them attention. Figure out what things you'll take and what things you won't and _respect yourself_ by sticking to it.\n\nThe sad part of point (6) is depending on your standards, it can get frustrating at times. That said, a little frustration is worth the eventual pain of a shitty relationship.", "created_utc": "1662950239.0", "edited": "False", "id": "io2qfsc", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_xaz0fh", "parent_id": "t1_inyg1ib", "score": "1", "subreddit": "stupidpol", "subreddit_id": "t5_hitz3"}, {"author": "OppenheimersGuilt", "body": "Very odd, I haven't encountered this in the slightest. It's actually much easier now to approach girls than before.\n\nMy gripe with the dating scene at the moment, as I mentioned in another comment, is the huge shift in dating norms. \n\nFor one, open relationships are starting to become far more common than they ever were. This goes hand-in-hand with even monogamy itself being redefined. It's not that these are _inherently_ wrong, they're just wrong for my goals of actually having a meaningful relationship.\n\n5 years ago, it would've been unthinkable for me to tell my gf: \"Hey, I'm gonna zip off to India backpacking with <insert girl> for a month or two\". If I would've said that, I could very well expect to be broken up with on the spot and to come around and collect my stuff. Or heck, people actually being shocked that kissing others is cheating (literally couldn't believe how often I encountered that).\n\nIt's not to say there weren't relationships before where this was normal, but those were the exception. I'm 30 and bringing up these situations with my friends in their early to mid 20s mostly returns a puzzled look of: \"well, what's wrong with any of that?\" Stark contrast to what was normal in my early-to-mid 20s.\n\nStrangely, this big shift came hand-in-hand with idpol, tiktok, the social media boom and only fans.", "created_utc": "1662948929.0", "edited": "1662949348.0", "id": "io2nofh", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_xaz0fh", "parent_id": "t1_inyp5xb", "score": "5", "subreddit": "stupidpol", "subreddit_id": "t5_hitz3"}, {"author": "OppenheimersGuilt", "body": "Times also changed. The rise in OnlyFans, TikTok and social media directly affected the dating scene and by extension usage of the app. Curiously, it also went in lockstep with the rise of idpol, but I digress.\n\nI've been using it on and off for the past 10 years or so. Can't complain. It's been great for relationships up until the last year and a bit.\n\nUsed to always be possible to find relationship-minded people and in fact, for me the typical usage was swipe -> meet someone -> date some years -> break up -> meet someone (rinse and repeat). What dating usually looks like.\n\nSuddenly, it has become _very_ difficult to meet relationship-minded people. A lot of people are now just entirely hookups, \"friends\" (with benefits), or relationships which are pretty much open.\n\nOf course, there definitely should be relationship-minded people but it feels like the scene really has changed. Not sure if that's directly blameable on the app. \n\nDigital nomading around Europe I have to admit monogamy is falling out of style in the 20-30 age range in a way I'd never seen before.\n\nGeography also plays a role. Just arrived in Spain after being in Central Europe and the difference is palpable. \n\nI have to admit, it does get me depressed a good amount of the time, where I think I might've actually missed my chance at meeting someone and starting a family (I'm 30). Sadly the dating at my age, aside from small seems to be full of people specifically _not_ looking for anything long-term. Then if I drop a few years it's like we come from different planets - the overton window of things that are OK/Not OK seems to have shifted brutally in the past few years.\n\nGod is this what getting old feels like?\n\nAnd no, I'm doing great in the looks department and all else (6'1, fit, 6 figures and starting a company soon, speak 4 languages, well-travelled, etc...).

It is probably related to the conceptualization of love. You can almost consider two opposite ways of viewing it: \n\n1) love is this quasi-supernatural force bringing two people together, the passionate romance being something you dive into headfirst \n\n2) love is more of a thing that develops or happens and the most important thing is to choose a partner that best complements you, as if you were shopping for a mate, weighing the pros and cons\n\nThese translate to a relationship being either 1) two people coming together to form a unit, a team.. all else be damned or 2) two independent and autonomous individuals cooperating in a partnership, carefully respecting boundaries \n\nOne of these will be chaotic, intense, passionate and quite possibly messy, yet deeply bonding, the other will be a bit more businesslike, with an underlying \"close but not too close\", somewhat colder relationship that does protect the individual from possibly big emotional damage, by placing individuality first.\n\nNote these are just two opposite ends of what is a spectrum, with the real world falling everywhere in between. My Latin American and Asian partners fell much closer to type 1 than 2 (just like me) while my European partners fell much closer to type 2 than type 1.
