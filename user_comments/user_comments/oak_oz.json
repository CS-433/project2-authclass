One, try and listen to content that's as casual Australian as possible. So, if you've mostly been listening to British or US content, seek out Australian or NZ stuff (message me if you want particular suggestions catered to your interests) or even just more diverse English from around the world, like Irish/Indian/Caribbean content, just to stretch the different ways English can sound to you. If you've already been listening to Oz content, try and find some that's really casual, like terrible podcasts, twitch streamers etc. The \"standard\" Australian accent found on a lot of tv is a lot more crisp than people speak in real life.\n\nTwo, this is completely unscientific, but I suggest trying to write out the ways Australians actually pronounce phrases. My dad used to have a top that said something along the lines of \"Strain Nashnul Yoonee\" because that's how we all say \"Australian National Uni\".

Learning a language is not cultural appropriation, nor is teaching it. \n\nI would say that teaching a language (regardless of whether or not your family is historically from that region) means you should pay attention to cultural nuance and be careful not to misrepresent the region or position yourself as a spokesperson for it. I've heard some incredibly cringe things from language teachers making broad generalisations about countries, speaking with authority because they \\~know the language\\~ . Possibly that kid has heard similar things and that's why he's bristling at you. Btw the less power the language has in its own right the more harmful this kind of stuff has the potential to be, which is one of the reasons people get touchy about Indigenous languages. But it is in no way inherently harmful, and Japanese is a pretty big language.\n\nOn the note that someone made, it is possible this kid doesn't speak Japanese, and if not, that's probably actually really hard to deal with. For some people language learning is a fun game or challenge, but then it's also incredibly personal for others. (For many people: both!) But it can be tiring to have people treat your language really casually, making jokes about how hard it is or how easy it is, or how it's stupid how it does X, or acting like it's just a game to get to the next level. Cross cultural experiences can be hard. As a language teacher of any language, this is going to come up and if you're sensitive, you can handle it well. \n\nAlso, you're... allowed to like Japanese culture. It's not problematic to have been really into anime and manga as a kid?
