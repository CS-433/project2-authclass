Was bit by the language bug in 6th grade and going ever since! And, while available time prevents me these days, happy to share some tips!\n\n- It's going to take time and practice. Even studying intensively, it's going to take time. There will be a point where you think you're getting good...keep going, not even close. You'll get to a point where you feel you're not improving for a long time (plateau)...keep going! But don't get discouraged by what I said, because all of that 'keep going' is more of your favorite YouTube creators, more VPNing to local Netflix and other local channels, reading interesting articles about your favorite stuff. There is endless content out there for the major languages. Switching over to, say, French-language YouTube, is like stepping into an entirely new YouTube.\n\n- Unless you're sticking with the dead languages, start listening early and often! With things like YouTube, Spotify, etc. literally at our fingertips, it's easy to access content, with many languages having content at a variety of levels. Why? It's one thing to being able to read and write, but if you want to speak and understand a language, then you need to be able to understand when people are speaking to you. Rarely does a language sound exactly like it's written at all times. Take French, for example. Written vs spoken? Quite different. English and Dutch? I'm sure you're well aware how *fun* spelling can be. Also, try to go a bit above your level. If you can understand like 70% and can get the basic idea, that's great! It's ok if you don't understand every word. What your getting is language in context. You're hearing the flow and inflection of the language. \n\n- Set realistic goals, and then plan out how you're going to get there. I'm not saying like, \"I wanna read my first novel in 6 months!\" and only do 20 minutes of DuoLingo and call it a day. A goal doesn't have to be a huge thing. Having a basic conversation with someone in your target language, making a video of you cooking your favorite dish in language, etc. Make your simple, fun for you, but progressive enough in that you're having to learn more to do more.\n\n- You do you. While there are many creators out there giving great (and some not so great) advice on language learning plans out there, it all comes down to how *you* learn. If you're, say, a more visual learner, incorporate more visual-based learning. I, personally, pick what works for me from a variety or sources.\n\n- Find your community. Whether on here, as there are language subreddits for just about every language, or myriad other places, there are lots of people that are looking to practice, teach, and learn, just like you, and most of the time, for free. Plus, the people that are learning are usually great resources to find...well...resources, and often advice on how to best use them.\n\n- Dead languages? Rock on! *<<chuckles in history degree>>* Probably the most vibrant currently is Latin. \u00d8rberg's *Lingua Latina per se Illustrata* (often shortened to LLpsI) has had a revival and become quite popular, using an absolutely no English, story learning method. One learns the vocab and grammar as they go. There is a large number of supplemental books, like excercise books, companion tales that give more varied practice with the lesson, simplified, annotated classics, etc., and going from page one of *Familia Romana* all the way through the second book, *Roma Aeterna*, you can supposedly read just about anything written in Latin. I really recommend this series, and the sidebar in /r/Latin has some great info. Latin was used from Ancient Roman times, all the way up through a few hundred years ago, when French and English started being used more widely. So literally well over 1500 years worth of Latin to read. From the thoughts of stoic philosophers and emperors, to cookbooks of said emperors, to scientific papers. As far as other popular dead languages, Old Norse is making a resurgence, but I would recommend maybe picking up Norwegian first. Actually fairly easy for English speakers, and Dutch would give you even more advantage. A book similar to LLpsI for Norwegian is the *Mystery of Nils/Mysteriet om Nils* series.  Ancient Greek is sometimes paired with Latin when it comes to classical languages, but definitely a step up in difficulty. \n\nI could try to give you more specific advice, if you already have a target language in mind. You said \"like Icelandic\". As in you want to learn it, or just dropping an example? Definitely not a beginner language, but if you have a true draw towards it, we're happy to give you the tools. That's one thing that's cool about the language learning community: there is so much free help out there, because one of the best ways to learn something is to teach and interact, so you have tons of language nerds out there that are happy to help!", "created_utc": "1652064963.0", "edited": "1652066480.0", "id": "i7vjamk", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_ulbywy", "parent_id": "t3_ulbywy", "score": "4", "subreddit": "IWantToLearn", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjo5"}, {"author": "cwf82", "body": "There's a hard to find toasted coconut rum sold somewhere in Florida.

Gaul, the area the Romans named encompassing a good portion of Western Europe, including what is now France. Gaulish was a Celtic language, some of which used a base 20 (vigesimal) system. \n\nBase 10 (decimal) is what a great majority of languages use today. Pretty easy. We have 10 fingers, once we reach that 10th finger, that was one lot of numbers, then we start over. The binary computer language, which is just base 2, is pretty easy. Just 0 and 1. 0, 1, 10, 11, 110, etc.  Back to base 20: what if you weren't finished counting until you used your fingers *and* your toes? Once they got to that last toe, *then* it clicked over. \n\nMuch easier to conceptualize visually, like the [Mayans](https://www.archimedes-lab.org/images8/Numeral_mayan.gif), but a bit harder to write out using our Arabic (decimal-based) numerals, so it will commonly change over to letters staring with 11. So 8, 9, 10, A, B, C, etc. to 19, which would be either J or K, depending on the system used. I think one skips of the letter I to eliminate confusion with 1, but not sure off the top of my head. So *10* now actually means 20. *1A* is 30, because *19* is 29, then it switches to letter A, so 30 would be *1*(20)+*A*(10). Can be quite confusing for those who grew up only knowing to use their fingers to count, especially since the Greeks and Romans were quite fond of writing everything down.\n\nAs time went on and what would become the French language evolved, it seems that the base 10 was more efficient and better suited for counting lower numbers, and vigesimal systems were becoming a minority. By the Middle Ages, decimal conversion progress bar was at 2/3. But then it stopped. At least in France.You still go from sixty-nine to sixty-ten, sixty-eleven. I guess they just...got bored with the change-over? Maybe trying to maintain for nostalgic/historic/poetic reasons? I haven't found an answer for that yet. Some French dialects, though, now opt for septante (70), huitante (80) and nonante (90). You'd be understood if you used them, but would very likely get strange looks and maybe a polite correction. \n\nSo, **TL;DR: From a base 20 counting system left over from its Celtic language roots, mostly got switched over to familiar  decimal system, but kinda stopped at 70 for some reason.**", "created_utc": "1650141208.0", "edited": "1650142475.0", "id": "i4zzu0s", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_u4tjhf", "parent_id": "t3_u4tjhf", "score": "4", "subreddit": "learnfrench", "subreddit_id": "t5_2sucz"}, {"author": "cwf82", "body": "Echidna.

Gonna take it out for now, as I can just do with *ajouter* right now.\n\n> tilt / rabattre Once again, I'm not sure if 'tilt' means something special in english cooking, but 'rabattre' in french usually means 'to fold' or 'to close', often just once.\n\nFor this, I was going for 'tilt the pan', [like when you're basting a steak](https://media1.giphy.com/media/RLJrfLPa5jD2FoWrOO/giphy.gif?cid=ecf05e47leadqk4ue3g52wdhani4zjjf5cqrp4uvi2iuhx8z&rid=giphy.gif&ct=g) or something with butter. Found this one on a cooking list, so kind of accepted it at face value. Would a simple *incliner* be a better choice, given this context?\n\n> unravel / effilocher Never heard of unraveling in english cooking, 'effilocher' in french could also be translated to 'pulling' in english. As in pulled pork etc...\n\nIt can be used with things that are bunched together or wound up, like pasta. Pretty specific term, so gonna take it off. I do like that I now know how to say \"pulled\". Was trying to figure that one out. Pulled pork is one of my favorite recipes. Will add that.\n\n> **warm / ti\u00e9dir** 'Ti\u00e8de' really means lukewarm, as in room temperature or a little more, definitely less than 40\u00b0C. 'Chaud / warm' would be a step further.\n\nOoooh that makes this one tougher. When I use warm, I basically mean anything under hot, which I usually define as \"can I comfortably use this as a face mask bolognese\", which is usually the 45ish (110-115F) range for me. When it goes from toasty to pain, then it's hot to me. But I'm weird. And I also digress. But we also use it as a general phrase to reheat or heat something up. \"Hey, can you warm up a cast iron pan for me, so I can sear a steak?\" Ahhh...languages...\n\n> roll out / d\u00e9ployer Could also be 'd\u00e9rouler'.\n\nWhich one would you normally use for, say, rolling out some dough?\n\n> raise / relever This one might be a trap depending on the english meaning. 'Relever' has a special meaning in french, it means 'adding heat / bite' as in spices, not temperature. A dish 'relev\u00e9' ou 'bien relev\u00e9' means very spicy/hot. And if the recipe says something like 'ajouter du poivre ou des zestes pour relever le plat' it means you want to add some 'zing' to it.\n\nGreat verb to know! Wifey and I usually make recipes by the book the first time, and then experiment and play with it. This is a good one. Merci!\n\n>In any case that's a great goal. When you feel confortable enough and if you are interested, I collect old french cookbooks, many of which have never been translated to another language. If you'd like to exercise, I could share recipes for you to translate and try to correct you afterward. Depending on the age of the book it can be really challenging, but it's a great dive into the basics of french cooking and cooking in general.\n\nMerci pour l'offre!

Your meat will not get more seasoning inside from the cooking process, so this stuff on the outside is a major portion of your flavor.\n\n- If you're cooking steak in a pan (cast iron recommended for best, even cooking), make sure to get the pan and oil up to temp first. You want it to sear, caramelizing the side into a wonderful, tasty crust that is going to lend a lot of flavor. Unless it's like blowing up or on fire, leave it there for however long you need to, and it should develop a nice, golden brown crust. This is called the Maillard (my-YARD) reaction. \n\n- For more added flavor, marinate your meat for at least 30 mins. There are many store-bought marinades that you just simply throw it in a large freezer bag with the meat, and toss it into the fridge. Easy peasy.\n\nIf you want to learn more about cooking, I suggest *[Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat](https://www.amazon.com/Salt-Fat-Acid-Heat-Mastering/dp/1476753830)* by Samin Nosrat.

At a church service.

Are you saying you're angry I didn't use the full name, like Sniper NT-HD 6-24X50AOL Scope with Red, Green Illuminated Reticle.\n\n>\"clip\"\n\nWell, I mean, that's what we call it in the military. You know...the people with lots of guns that know how to use them effectively? I could have interchangeably used the word magazine, which we also use in the military. Both are common parlance for the removable storage unit for ammunition. \n\nOr will you chide me for using the word gun, which, in the military, technically refers to large guns (ship, anti-aircraft, etc)? Outside of basic training, we all called our rifles and pistols guns. Or weapons. Or whatever the fuck we wanted, as long as the point got across.\n\nI'm pro gun, there, guy. I'm *for* having a gun in the home for protection. Just anti-nutball's having way too many guns. I'm for people having weapons to hunt. In fact, as long as hunting laws are observed to help preserve populations, I think hunting is an awesome idea. But, as I said before: a fully decked *assault* weapon is not necessary for hunting. That's like using a sledgehammer to whack in one nail. Or using a katana to dice an onion. Technically it can do the job, but it isn't the correct tool. \n\nYes, our gun laws are shit at both the state and federal levels. That's why there is so much gun crime. Putting regulations on their production, so they don't flood legal and illegal markets, and updating laws on how they are bought, who has the mental wherewithal to *responsibly* own a firearm, etc., will help with that.\n\nI'm fine with Steve walking down to his local gun shop and picking out a new Ruger .308 for deer hunting. He just needs to go through the process: has he been trained in proper safety? Anything shady in his background? Does he have the proper way to store the weapon in a safe manner?\n\nWhat I'm not OK with is Steve buying his 8th shotgun and his 3rd Desert Eagle because \"the government is coming for me and my militia\". The Desert Eagle he plans on wearing openly on his hip as a metal penis extension and tell just about everyone he sees about his gun rights and that no one better mess with him, or else God will have to sort them out.\n\nI lived and breathed guns for years. I also know that I will never own one. I have PTSD, depression, anxiety, and more, from playing in the sand too much, and I know for a fact that I am not mentally stable enough to have a firearm just hanging around. But there are plenty of people out there that are in the same boat, if not worse, than I am, and they own whole arsenals.\n\nI'm for the 2nd Amendment, but I also know that it was a *much* different time when that was written. [This guy explains it pretty well.](https://youtu.be/K_Aq8ZIbDQQ) Most people are perfectly fine having a gun or two, if they need it. Hell, if I felt more sure of my mental state, I would likely have not only a gun, but a concealed carry permit, as well. \n\nBut there are just some people out there that really don't need a gun (or 50) in their hands. *That's* what they are trying to do.
