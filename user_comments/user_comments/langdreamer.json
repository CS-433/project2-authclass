That can become part of your identity, and even if you can still learn to understand \"correct\" English, you'll still feel that the way you're talking is totally fine.

This would explain that **some** people who start learning English in school (and read a lot) still manage to eventually get a good English accent. My hypothesis is that it requires a person with a quite conscientious personality, so that's why I don't recommend it to the majority of people, especially if you can find enough comprehensible listening resources. I've written about this in more detail here:  [https://dreaminglanguages.wordpress.com/2019/08/31/2-kinds-of-foreign-accent-what/](https://dreaminglanguages.wordpress.com/2019/08/31/2-kinds-of-foreign-accent-what/) \n\nPlease note that I don't say that either accent is better than the other one, and both of them connect with native-like accent on the higher end.", "created_utc": "1594829095.0", "edited": "False", "id": "fy5mee8", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_hrff8b", "parent_id": "t1_fy5bili", "score": "3", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "langdreamer", "body": "Pablo from Dreaming Spanish here.\n\nAs people have commented, delaying reading is not part of CI per se. The method of Dreaming Spanish is heavily based on ALG, created by linguist Dr. J Marvin Brown, based on Krashen's hypotheses. ALG goes into a lot more depth to explain what's exactly happening in your head when you acquire languages, and in my opinion offers a very simple and complete framework that provides explanations for phenomena that Krashen doesn't really go into, like accent, fossilization, and some studies that indicate that conscious study can actually have negative correlation with language achievement. I recommend the book \"From the outside in\" if you want to know more about the theory behind it:  [https://dreaming-spanish-misc.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/From+the+Outside+In+-+J.+Marvin+Brown.pdf](https://dreaming-spanish-misc.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/From+the+Outside+In+-+J.+Marvin+Brown.pdf) \n\nI don't believe reading, even early on, has detrimental effects to the acquisition of vocabulary and grammar.

We are already very proficient at coordinating all the different muscles in our mouth to produce our native language.\n\nThe experience of most teachers is that students do well in pronunciation and accent imitation drills, and then they seem to have forgotten everything when doing spontaneous speaking.\n\nThe problem is not muscle memory, but rather a lack of a mental image of the target sound. Once the sound of the language in our head is very clear after extensive listening to the language, we can speak and do the tiny corrections necessary to match that mental image. This is where muscle memory kicks in, to allow us to repeat this coordination fast and without errors. But muscle memory can not provide the tiny coorrections in mouth movements necessary to match a native accent.\n\nAlso, please don't believe that the descriptions on Wikipedia or the IPA will let you get even close to a native accent. Every description of a phone is necessarily a rough simplification, since we have many muscles in our mouth, and the movement of each muscle is linear, it doesn't have fixed positions that can be unequivocally described with only words. Also, you'll still be missing the pace and intonation you need to be close to a native speaker.\n\nAlso, if you are going to argue that you know a better way of getting a good accent, it would be good to provide some examples of success cases.\n\nIf you're interested in learning more about mental images, I recommend reading the book \"*From the Outside In*\" by Marvin Brown.
