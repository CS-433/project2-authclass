By taking that action you are literally taking your life, and possibly the lives of other, in your own very arrogant hands. No rider can accurately predict the intents and actions of other drivers on the roadway. You don\u2019t know if they are about to spill their hot coffee in their lap and swerve. You don\u2019t know if their kid is about to throw a sippy cup at the windshield obscuring their view. You don\u2019t know if a person is more intent on their phone than they are on the road and they don\u2019t even see you coming.\n\nMotorcycling is inherently dangerous and not safe, and all the things you called out are risks regardless of whether or not you're lane splitting. We don't make riding illegal just because it's dangerous. If you look at the actual _data_ you'll see that when done within strict guidelines like keeping a low speed delta and only splitting under a certain speed, that it's actually safer for riders than sitting in traffic. \n\nYes we can't predict every action a driver is going to take, but if you're a good rider you'll learn certain signs while observing the drivers around you that allow you to predict certain actions to help mitigate risk of impact. A few examples of this while lane splitting is that I watch people's head movements in their cars, I watch tires turning into my lane while in heavy traffic, I avoid splitting while there are gaps in traffic that a car might want to change lanes into.

I love both countries, but Korea is a better base to work from for a number of reasons.\n\nAs others have mentioned Japan has loads to do and see, but actually living there is less ideal. The internet situation was problematic for me in the main cities both times I went. The unlimited tourist sims were throttled like crazy and most AirBnBs I've stayed at in Tokyo and Osaka have those crappy pocket wifi things with limited data instead of proper wifi. Though when I was down in the Kii peninsula I had 300mb internet in my AirBnB there, so YMMV. In terms of cost, I didn't find it too expensive in Osaka, but Tokyo is a tad pricier (though not as bad as people claim). It was really hard to connect with locals when I was there since they seem to keep gaijin at arms length, but there are plenty of foreigners to socialize with if that's your thing. Overall I absolutely love visiting Japan, but don't think I could work there long-term.\n\nSouth Korea on the other hand is a fantastic place to base out of for a while. I really enjoyed my time in Busan the most, and Seoul was fun too. The internet was ridiculously fast everywhere I went in that country, and the AirBnBs were cheap and plentiful in both Busan and Seoul and in the countryside. I had an easier time hanging out with locals in Busan and meeting random people at bars, Seoul wasn't bad but there were way more foreigners as expected. Food was amazing in both cities, and prices could range depending on what food you're eating. Plenty of cafes to work from too if that's your thing. Overall I really enjoyed my time working in Korea, it would make a better base out of those two countries IMO.

A car right in front of me suddenly starts changing lanes without looking or signaling, and they hit me and push me into the lane to my left.

As I get pushed into the left lane, traffic in that lane immediately stops and I lock my brakes and my bike slides under the car in front of me.\n\nLuckily I was going fairly slow, so I only got a little road rash and soreness, and my bike was able to be ridden the rest of the way to work (and home later that day). Unfortunately the car that hit me kept going, and the car I slid under had a little damage (~$800 worth) that I was found at fault for since it was my bike that hit their car in their lane.\n\nOverall a shitty situation that raised my insurance rates a bit, but it could have been *much* worse had I been going any faster. I still commute every day into San Francisco, and I still lane split. Overall I feel it's safe as long as you aren't crazy and watch out for the inattentive drivers.
