I used to be an internet armchair grammarian obsessed with appearing grammatically perfect on the internet. I wouldn't use emoticons, would stick to a rigid paragraph structure, and I would stray as far away as possible from using vocabulary or grammatical structures deemed \"nonstandard\" or \"dialectal,\" even in the slightest way. Just like how I am now typing, to prove a point that I do not slip into \"error-ridden\" sentence structures out of ignorance, or even apathy. I *do* care about how I am perceived on the internet, and that is why everything I say is not perfect on the internet.\n\nI'm even doing that really pretentious thing where I don't end sentences with prepositions. I could go a step further and not use contractions *at all,* but that slips into a new realm of awkwardness.\n\nMoving on, there is a concept that sociolinguists study called *register.* It is the way that people talk with each other in agreement with their relationship with participants in a conversation. That was a lengthy introduction, but it's the reason why you won't walk up to the King of England and say, \"What's poppin'?\" A lot of people might think of registers as the black-and-white divide between \"formal speech\" and \"informal speech,\" but it is so much more than that. There are registers that describe people speaking in a pseudo-medi\u00e6val way, what with poorly-utilised \"thous\" and half-baked grammatical inflections. \"Babytalk\" is also a register of English, when a person \"chats\" with an infant, they are exercising another register. Headlinese is, too. Newspaper headlines, wet floor signs, various other pieces of text meant to \"pop out,\" will often omit the copula and any articles, \"[The floor is] SLIPPERY WHEN [it is] WET.\"\n\nThat's the introduction to the wide range of different, non-standard, and formally or prescriptively incorrect registers of English. The internet, unsurprisingly, evolved its own way of speech. The way most people prefer to speak is with little punctuation, especially at the end of sentence, all words in a lower case, and dialectal terms taking route, like ta, ope, yo, or sah. This way of speech represents, in a toneless environment, a more aloof or dead-pan version of speaking. Writing in ALL CAPS is synonymous with yelling or at the least, emphasis, in spoken conversation. Using punctuation with a combination of lower-case text might be perceived as disinterest or anger. Periods usually imply falling inflection. Typing as I type right now will imply sternness or unfriendliness. When I typed like this daily, I honestly worried and scared some people, because this is just seen as unnatural on the internet.\n\n\nNow, I'm not going to say that I intentionally mix up \"your\" and \"you're.\" The difference has always been blaringly obvious to me. That said, why does the emphasis on the internet have to be on \"being correct\" or \"being perceived as educated\"? Why can't it be on being *understood*? There is no case where a mix-up of \"your\" and \"you're\" would hinder intelligibility at all. The person who made the meme had \"with\" in the wrong position, yet we still understood his point. If it wasn't such a bad point, I would have respected it.\n\nTo many grammarians' chagrin, I use \"ur.\" I'll use \"brb\" and sometimes omit punctuation. I may even take the apostrophe out of words like \"I'm,\" oh, the horror! When people say that people don't care, *this* is the specific concept that they're discussing.

This field of linguistics is the same used to discredit dialects of English such as African American Vernacular English, Chicano English, Hiberno-English (Irish English), Cockney, and Nigerian English as being \"incorrect\" or \"English with bad grammar.\" It's not the position to take for full-fledged sociolects or dialects. I don't mean to throw out any buzzwords or get arrested for breaking Godwin's Law or something, but it's... racist. A variant of language unlike your own is not bad \\[language\\]. Let me clarify that I don't think you're actually doing that, but prescriptivist linguistics is a dangerous position to take. The rest of this post will not be predicated on that assumption nor tearing it down.\n\nLet's talk about [register](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195214), though. That's what this conversation is about. Register is a method of speech dependent on different social situations. The most basic idea of register comes from linguistic formality. When meeting the King of England, you're not likely to say \"Yo, how's it goin',\" are you? Being too formal to your friends, as well, creates sociolinguistic distance. That one guy who constantly uses formal \"would\" such as \"I would like that,\" or analytic constructions using \"did\" would probably be seen as slightly weird outside of one's friend group. Register doesn't just have to do with formality, even the way we talk to babies (babyspeak) is an English register!\n\nThat's the basics of register. In our case, we're talking about the [internet](https://scholarspace.manoa.hawaii.edu/server/api/core/bitstreams/971b4fd3-0448-4db6-b3bf-0f8ccd8de4f9/content), and even the internet possesses its own sociolinguistic register. When you analyse internet grammar, it isn't even too random. Most of the trends in English found on the internet come about because \"I don't want to be seen as too abrupt or harsh.\" A good example is the classic \"ok\" vs. \"ok.\" (emphasis on the period in the second one). Using punctuation online will lead to you being seen as more uptight than you want to be in several groups. When I'm writing an e-mail, I'm going to use a lot of punctuation and I am going to be using it correctly. Language is a tool to express ourselves accurately and earnestly, it is not a rigid thing, and if we need to find a way to express ourselves via a new medium, human beings \\*can\\* and \\*will.\\* I will expand upon this in my next paragraph.\n\nYou can denote tone in English by speaking it a certain way, but what if you're on the internet? Tone registers aren't standard in English paper writing /gen, you can't annotate yourself as if you're a character speaking in a storybook, \"I said cautiously.\" Instead, what differentiates between whether someone might be joking, maybe is taking the piss, or is irate with your actions comes down to what you say and especially how you say it. You've seen people write in all caps before, haven't you? That's \"bad English,\" yet it still tells you exactly how that person is feeling, sometimes it's to emphasise a point, even. Using an ellipses (...) after a sentence gives an air of scepticalness (or does it...), and tYpInG lIkE thIs is very classic \"I'm making fun of your words\" speech. Just a few examples of non-standard styles of English which really give the internet register its personality.\n\nThe bottom line is that arguing from the basis of \"that person speaks bad English\" is just a poor argument through-and-through. Now, I was actually giving the person who was writing this comment a pass because they seemed intrigued and curious, never mind them calling it a \" common grammatical error,\" it's common for a reason; and the people who do it learnt from interacting enough on the internet that using spaces after your punctuation softens your point. Also, I think the American Saying Shit (ASS) in the post was a rather goofy case. Of course when you try to rag on someone's education for such a dumb reason then proceed to use non-standard or a non-academic register, you also deserve to be ragged on a little bit. I laughed at him, too, because the way he was speaking was funny. I recognise it not as incorrect, but as a non-standard and inappropriate way of speech in this context.\n\nAlso, call me petty, especially after arguing against this kind of thinking, but I'd like to point out that these sentences:\n\n>It doesn't look informal, it looks incorrect\\*\\*. Because it is.\\*\\*\n\n...are not actually prescriptively correct. Introducing a subordinate clause means that you should at least attach it to an independent clause. \"Because it is\" is not a full thought.

French people have taught me so much about French in a very direct way of speaking. I love this, because it allows me to improve my language without uncertainty, really. The French speakers I've spoken to weren't even particularly elitist about it, they knew I was a learner and wanted to help.  \n\n\nI'm going to compare this to my Dutch studies, because I feel like Dutch people can never explain why anything is (in terms of there language). Dutch people say that Dutch is basically English in terms of vocab and grammar, and therefore should be easy, when I find that to be so far removed from what the actual case is. Just because Dutch people learnt English super intuitively when they were like 7 years old, English and Dutch appear super similar and they can't imagine why English speakers have trouble understanding V2 word order in only some context, seemingly random cases of inversion, and so many arbitrary differences where two concepts that represent the same construction in English are different in Dutch. And yes, all of that should be obvious. Dutch and English will clearly share some differences, they're different languages. A lot of the Dutch speakers I meet act like it's my problem for not understanding that \"it is how it is.\" Beggars shouldn't be choosy, though, it's super difficult to explain your native language to a foreign speaker. I just think that, if you put yourself in a position to teach someone, you should at least be prepared to tell them how it works so they may improve ALL their sentences, and not just rotely memorise the one that you said was wrong.  \n\n\nThat's the main part of my rant, but besides that, I find people who use literal translations as the explanation for something. I agree that literal translation can be used to help contextualise statements if you were to take them literally, but they shouldn't be the only explanation. For example, on the Duolingo forum for the Dutch sentence: Het spijt me, there were a lot of confused faces in the reply section asking \"how is this different from sorry (in Dutch)?\" And the moderator reply was \"Het spijt me translates to It saddens me,\" which was probably the least helpful response the curious user could have gotten. Considering the differences in which one phrase would be used over the other, the module moderator couldn't produce a suitable answer! Nothing like \"You use het spijt me whenever you are feeling secondhand sadness for the people you are apologising to, such as when you find out a family member died, or if you lost their pet goldfish.\" I hate when this happens with any language.  \n\n\nPS: I did rant a lot on how Dutch speakers are like this but like... just like with French speakers, it isn't all of them that are like this. Though I haven't had any amazing teaching experiences live, there are several great platforms for studying Dutch grammar and really getting to understand it. Like Learn Dutch with Niels on YouTube or DutchGrammar dot com. Those have been the pillars I've stood upon when learning something in Dutch which other people have not been particularly helpful with. It's whatever, really.

Emphasis on the never. Memorising cognates and loans, English has a lot of the latter, will get you by, but due to many sound and spelling changes, the forms of these helpful hints have changed a lot.\n\nPronunciation, unfortunately, is much harder in English for speakers of any language. Very few non-native speakers that I've heard can perfectly immitate one of the larger accent-groups of English: UK, North American, or Aussie dialects. This is fine if you're okay with sounding like a foreigner who's learnt English, and this doesn't really affect people that much. Especially in America, where we're pretty used to hearing non-native accents among other native yet cultural accents. This will definitely also depend on native language, but confusing sounds in English feature /r/, /\u0275/, and many more sounds which are easy to learn, but hard to master. Considering the \"English r\" and both \"English th's\" aren't found in too many of the world's languages, they're difficult to explain and pick up for non-native speakers.\n\nFinally, grammar. This is the easiest part of English. English grammar has two strict word in an indepedent clause, SVO in the active and OVS in the passive. English's grammar gets largely redundant, which is why you can remove a lot of parts of speech, but people can infer what you meant (While it would be grammatically correct to say \"hand me an apple,\" simply saying \"hand me apple\" is a sensible construction in that people will know what is meant immediately).\n\nConjugation-wise, English inflects for the past participle, the past tense, and the third-person present indicative. The former two tend to be the same word, but there are cases (wrote/written, ate/eaten, drank/drunk) where they are different. The most difficult part about conjugations, and really, all of English, are the irregularities. This goes back to what I said about vocabulary, which is never easy to learn. Due to English not being a language where you can easily infer part of speech by looking at a word (unless you have the knowledge of English's affixes), knowing what might be an irregular word is super difficult.\n\nIn language, you can't improve in one area without having some drawbacks. English's lack of inflection might seem great for non-natives without time to learn a complex conjugation system, but this results in an analytical language where meaning is determined by placement in a sentence.\n\nCompare this to Japanese, which also doesn't have a terrible amount of conjugation beyond tense and mood. Japanese counterbalances a lack of synthetics with its particle system, which features grammatical particles. Segments like \u3092 and \u304c allow for looser sentence construction than English. \n\nThere's no real use in categorising language in terms of difficulty, as people say, because the difference between two languages is too abstract to say \"English is easy compared to other languages,\" but I hope you liked my review of mostly English grammar compared to no language.", "created_utc": "1659363900.0", "edited": "False", "id": "iiieaew", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_wd7l2w", "parent_id": "t1_iihwcew", "score": "16", "subreddit": "Hololive", "subreddit_id": "t5_29numb"}, {"author": "PawnToG4", "body": "I looked up Connecticut's dialect: [Western New English](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_New_England_English), and was frankly surprised how \"neutral\" it seemed, more than the dialects over here are!\n\nSome fun things to list, though:\n\nGenerally, cities around the North (from Illinois all the way to the West New England areas) are going through a shift in vowels unique to that area.

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_English#Grammar) lists out AmEnglish's \"shrunk\" and \"sunk,\" versus \"shrank\" and \"sank\" as being examples of divergent grammar, and there are tonnes of these kinds of differences that you could list out. Consider the sentences: \"I'm taking him to hospital\" (UK English), and \"I'm taking him to the hospital\" (AmEnglish).  \n\n\nSecondly, [American English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_dialects_of_English#North_America) and [British English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_dialects_of_English#United_Kingdom) aren't simply one uniform dialect. They're superdialects, with several dialects below them. British English is much more divergent in its dialects, and actually forms an Anglic Dialect Continuum from Scots, spoken in the south of Scotland, all the way to southern dialects of UK English. For example, in [Sussex English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language_in_Southern_England#Sussex), you have reduplicated plural endings. This seems super juvenile to speakers of standard English, but it's grammatically correct to say \"We've ratses in our basement.\" You also have an essentially universal \"she\" vowel, replacing the word \"it\" basically.  \n\n\nThat's not that bad, though. It's difficult to understand for any speaker due to accent and vocabulary changes as well, but it's honestly mostly intelligible. It's even worse if you instead go north of London. The Northern area is where you get things like [Northumbrian English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northumbrian_dialect). Most of the [Northern dialects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language_in_Northern_England) spoken were descended more directly from Old English without the Middle English middle-man that happened with the standard English that exists now. Northumbrian in particular retains its T-V distinction (that is, they use the words thou and thee for the informal and unambiguously singular, and ye and you for the formal and/or plural. That's not all, though, because Northumbrian English as well as a majority of the dialects in the continuum feature wildly different vocabularies which may keep some weak vowel distinctions that modern English failed to keep.  \n\n\nIf you want to see a few vocabulary lists:  \n[Northumbrian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northumbrian_dialect#Vocabulary)  \n[Cumbrian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumbrian_dialect#Dialect_words)  \n[East Midlands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Midlands_English#Vocabulary)  \n\n\nBefore I forget, this conversation also centres around American English! AmEnglish doesn't just have one universal grammar, either. My favourite example is [Positive Anymore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_anymore), which is used mostly in [Midlands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midland_American_English) dialects, meaning the opposite of how \"anymore\" is actually used to speakers outside of those dialects. [Appalachian English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appalachian_English#A-verb-ing_(a-prefixing)) has an interesting grammatical property in that the [confix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumfix) a- -ing retains its usage. This is just taking into account the \"white\" dialects of American English. Not even the ethnic dialects such as AAVE, Cajun English, or Chicano English. All tend to be so much more different.  \n\n\nAnother thing that's important here is exposure, haha. I wouldn't assume that EU Portuguese speakers and Brazilian speakers get much of the other's media. American exposure to British speakers is super high, though, and so that's also the case the other way around. Even AAVE is rather high in exposure to American English speakers, so we don't have trouble understanding it. We don't even comprehend, occasionally, how different AAVE is to the rest of the North American dialects (some don't even call it a dialect, but usually for different and more prescriptivist reasons).", "created_utc": "1658603806.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ihcurtk", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_w60tpp", "parent_id": "t1_ihcfwx8", "score": "10", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "PawnToG4", "body": "most prescriptivists don't know the meaning of the word prescriptivism because they never learnt anything about linguistics, anyway", "created_utc": "1658545714.0", "edited": "False", "id": "iha05oo", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_w5k43w", "parent_id": "t1_ih8g6v4", "score": "18", "subreddit": "linguisticshumor", "subreddit_id": "t5_2vwiq"}, {"author": "PawnToG4", "body": "[Fare used to mean a journey or travelling](https://www.etymonline.com/word/fare). \"Fare thee well\" is in terms of wellbeing, but it's more like \"I hope your journey goes well\" if you spoke in more modern terms.", "created_utc": "1658533838.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ih9b8ln", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_w5g8t3", "parent_id": "t1_ih9au6x", "score": "5", "subreddit": "anglish", "subreddit_id": "t5_2sne7"}, {"author": "PawnToG4", "body": "Well, Fahrenheit to Faringhood is what you would get if you use purely cognates regardless of meaning.

That can be interpreted either way, so the issue wasn't with either interpretation formed by you or me. It was just with the way the claim was worded. That's why I clarified it, I didn't argue it. You could say that there are far more different accents in Texas if we talk about people who move in from Georgia, Iowa, California (those are just random state examples with markedly different accents to Texas, they mean nothing), bringing in several other accents to the state, but that's not what anybody thinks when we talk about \"Texan accents,\" is it?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>You apparently only recognize dialects and broad categories of accents.\n\nI have no idea where you got this idea from, especially using this random quote. I recognise the USA as having several accents of English - a number that, like you say, can't be quantified - all of those that fall under the American English umbrella. I only realise that, using major phonological differences, we can only describe 5 of those as being in Texas.  \n\n\n>You do not recognize a difference between Southern Georgian and Texas Southern, so I don't trust your judgement.\n\nThis isn't my judgement at all, this was a descriptive article made by the wikipedia page(s) that you gave me. In terms of the dialect page, the wikipedia page groups the south under one \"U.S Southern English\" umbrella. However, clicking on the link gives you more information into its phonology, and therefore accent. Not so shockingly for me or you, the Wiki page also recognises the south as not just being one big dialect, but Georgia itself is rather distinct from the general Southern. The Wikipedia page marks several forms of English  \n\n\nThis is irrelevant in terms of Texan accents, which I also used your dialects page for. I counted manually all of the distinctive qualities in those Texan accents recorded by the Wikipedia page using the Atlas of American English. I simply counted 5, with one of those being broadly Southern English, which wikipedia does recognise as a diverse group of smaller dialects (yet the page for [Southern English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_American_English#Inland_South_and_Texas) notes much of Texan English as not being distinct enough phonologically in order to have its own \"accent,\" except for the 5 different groups that I pointed out).  \n\n\nOverall, you have no idea whether or not *I* recognise the accents of Texas. I never phrased my original question that way. I asked for a descriptive citation for the claim that accents in Texan are particularly distinct, and the number of potential phonological changes goes way beyond the count of 3. At this point, I'd even appreciate you just straight up describing all of the different phonological changes that *you* noticed generally among some of the towns can think of.

I'd love to hear these accents, though, apparently some people draw parallels to the accents of the Midwest/General American, which I find super intriguing!\n\nThe rest of the [Texan English Wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texan_English) explains five of the six cities mentioned prior, but doesn't demonstrate Dallas's \"enormous variability\" at all for the rest of the phonetics section. Which really sucked because that's the part that interested me the most dammit!!  I couldn't count more than 5 different uniquely Texan geographical accents by explaining every single phonological shift: Houston, the dynamic duo of Abilene and Austin, El Paso has a completed cot-caught merger, which I guess counts as different enough, and Amarillo and Odessa also join as cot-caught mergers. Finally, general Texas Southern (which is denoted to be largely homogenous makes 5 accents based purely on geography. The wiki also makes note of another age-based accent, where young speakers are fronting the trap vowel more than elder speakers, but apparently it's nothing widespread.\n\nFinally, I need to apologise and make note of this:  \n\n\n>Dialects of Texas would include American English, Spanglish, Ebonics at a minimum.\n\nI assumed this was the proposition of everyone in this conversation. When I referenced dialects (or accents) of Texas, I'm referring to uniquely Texan ones.

By that point, it becomes a new language entirely (such as Afrikaans is considered a different language, despite Afrikaans speakers being able to understand Dutch mostly, but not the other way around). It should at least be partially intelligible. This is rather contentious, too, some people consider Scots and Northumbrian English to be their own languages with how different they are. That is why it makes up a dialect continuum, the closer to London you get, the more \"English-y English\" you have (this is also what's happening in the example you gave with your [Dutch dialect continuum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialect_continuum#Continental_West_Germanic_continuum), the closer to Holland you get, the more Holland-y things begin to sound).\n\nIf you want a mutually unintelligible (or asymmetrical intelligible) variation on another language (using Dutch dialects as your prime example), then the most radical you could go would be to call Portuguese a dialect of Spanish (or a dialect of Latin, perhaps).\n\nOn that, though, I will concede that a lot of what makes a dialect considered a dialect isn't always up to \"if I can understand you and you can understand me, we're the same language,\" it's often a political discussion. \"We're united because we speak (hardly) the same language!!!\" vs. \"We're separated because we speak (slightly) different languages!!!\" One might consider Ukrainian and Luxembourgish to both be dialects of Russian and German, respectively. They're more intelligible than some of the things we consider to be dialects, nowadays. Czech and Slovak is a really good example of \"are they really different languages?\"", "created_utc": "1655745948.0", "edited": "False", "id": "id2xu4m", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_vg4map", "parent_id": "t1_id2rgax", "score": "4", "subreddit": "ShitAmericansSay", "subreddit_id": "t5_2w57u"}, {"author": "PawnToG4", "body": "Well, unsure what you mean by \"really,\" [the U.S has several dialects in English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_dialects_of_English#North_America).  [Australia has less dialects with only like 3 of them in English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_dialects_of_English#Australia). What it lacks, however, is a [dialect continuum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialect_continuum), which some would say can be considered a monument to a nation's diversity and culture, if every 500 kilometres speaks just slightly differently. Sure, all of America's dialects have blaringly obvious differences (larger accent changes like [Cot-Caught](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cot%E2%80%93caught_merger), [California Vowel Shift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_English), a few [non-rhotic accents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhoticity_in_English#United_States)... even grammar may change, such is the example of [positive anymore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_anymore)), but someone from a tiny town in New York can understand another from Cali perfectly, and vice versa. There's 100% mutual intelligibility throughout virtually all American English accents. The least mutually intelligible to my knowledge in the USA being AAVE, using very colourful grammar and dialect differences, a lot loaned from the languages of the West African frontier :)  \n\n\nGetting sidetracked, but something I think is fun, is the [UK's dialect continuum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_dialects_of_English#United_Kingdom), where there are several towns slowly shifting in their vocabulary. Some might call [Scots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scots_language) the beginning of this continuum, where it spreads all the way down to Southern England. Northumbria might use the word \"yark,\" while a while over in Norfolk, they use \"thack.\"  \n\n\nI mean, I don't want to undermine the linguistic credibility of American English.
