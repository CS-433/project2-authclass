The main problem was the tens of millions who lost their jobs due to a pandemic. That lost income would then affect spending, which would affect corporate and small business revenue and profit and so forth. \n\nBut in late March, right around the time of the bottoming out of the market, Congress pushed forward the CARES act, pushing $2 trillion into the economy - three times what was put in back in 2009. Even then, there was talk about more bills to pump more money in. The vast majority of this money went into unemployment, business payrolls, and stimulus checks. The main problem, at least for a time, seemed to be solved. \n\nNow the population would still have income and then could spend it, in limited ways in the short run. Further, the pandemic resulted in a business climate where large corporations, like those in S&P500 or DJIA, could soak up an increasing share of the personal spending, since small businesses will struggle with online sales and delivery.", "created_utc": "1590143909.0", "edited": "False", "id": "frfpvzd", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_gnxw1m", "parent_id": "t1_frcz6t8", "score": "1", "subreddit": "IAmA", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qzb6"}, {"author": "fauz87", "body": "That doesn't mean that building housing units has to be limited.

They know there is a market for $300k homes so they risk their money to convert a previously cheaper house into a more expensive one. \n\nHowever, if instead, we had just built more new homes in the first place, then the investor would have realized that investing his money on this remodeling would be too risky. He now knows that 3,000 new luxury homes are being built and he's unsure if he could sell his property. After all, there's only so many people who can afford a $300k home. So instead, he doesn't buy the $170k home and instead someone else who isn't going to remodel it does. Now, the rich people get their homes and the middle class do too.\n\n>What you want is to increase the volume.
