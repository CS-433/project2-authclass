[{"author": "LynxGlad", "body": "A case (rus. \u00ab\u043f\u0430\u0434\u0435\u0436\u00bb) is basically a situation where a noun or a pronoun changes its form to show some semantic meaning, for example, an object being used in a specific way.\n\nIf a language has cases, they are often rather strictly defined with various verbs demanding which case is to be used for the object.\n\nConsider Russian, for example, since you already speak it. We have 6 cases (as natives learn in school, even though in fact there are extra ones). The meaning of the verb signifies which case is supposed to be used. In order to figure out the necessary case, we are taught to ask the questions \u201cwho?\u201d and \u201cwhat?\u201d and see in which case we instinctively put it.\n\nFor example, let\u2019s take the word \u00ab\u0441\u0442\u043e\u043b\u00bb (table) and use it with various verbs.\n\n\u041d\u0430\u0445\u043e\u0434\u0438\u0442\u044c\u0441\u044f (to be located): \u043d\u0430\u0445\u043e\u0434\u0438\u0442\u0441\u044f \u043a\u0442\u043e?/\u0447\u0442\u043e? - \u0441\u0442\u043e\u043b. This is the nominative case (\u0438\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043f\u0430\u0434\u0435\u0436), where \u00ab\u0441\u0442\u043e\u043b\u00bb is a subject.\n\n\u0421\u0434\u0435\u043b\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0438\u0437 (to make of): \u0441\u0434\u0435\u043b\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0438\u0437 \u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e?/\u0447\u0435\u0433\u043e? - \u0441\u0442\u043e\u043b\u0430. This is the genitive case (\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043f\u0430\u0434\u0435\u0436), in Russian we use to it to show that something is not present (\u00ab\u043d\u0435\u0442 \u0441\u0442\u043e\u043b\u0430\u00bb) or the starting point of something (\u201c\u0441\u0434\u0435\u043b\u0430\u043d\u043e \u0438\u0437 \u0441\u0442\u043e\u043b\u0430\u00bb, \u00ab\u0443\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0441\u043e \u0441\u0442\u043e\u043b\u0430\u00bb)\n\n\u041f\u043e\u043c\u043e\u0433\u0430\u0442\u044c (to help): \u043f\u043e\u043c\u043e\u0433\u0430\u0442\u044c \u043a\u043e\u043c\u0443?/\u0447\u0435\u043c\u0443? - \u0441\u0442\u043e\u043b\u0443. This is dative case (\u0434\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043f\u0430\u0434\u0435\u0436), which we use to show that the action expressed by the verb is done towards this object. In Russian, we also use it to refer to the person who perceives the situation: \u00ab\u043c\u043d\u0435 \u043d\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0442\u0441\u044f\u00bb (\u2018I like\u2019), \u201c\u043c\u043d\u0435 \u043a\u0430\u0436\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f\u00bb (\u2018it seems to me\u2019)\n\n\u0412\u0438\u0434\u0435\u0442\u044c (to see): \u0432\u0438\u0434\u0435\u0442\u044c \u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e?/\u0447\u0442\u043e? - \u0441\u0442\u043e\u043b. This is the accusative case (\u0432\u0438\u043d\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043f\u0430\u0434\u0435\u0436), which we use with the direct object of a transitive verb. \n\n\u041a\u0438\u0434\u0430\u0442\u044c\u0441\u044f (to throw): \u043a\u0438\u0434\u0430\u0442\u044c\u0441\u044f \u043a\u0435\u043c?/\u0447\u0435\u043c? - \u0441\u0442\u043e\u043b\u043e\u043c. This is the instrumental case (\u0442\u0432\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043f\u0430\u0434\u0435\u0436), which signifies that the object is used as an instrument or a means to do something, just as the name says.\n\nLastly, \u0434\u0443\u043c\u0430\u0442\u044c \u043e (to think about): \u0434\u0443\u043c\u0430\u0442\u044c \u043e \u043a\u043e\u043c?/\u043e \u0447\u0435\u043c? - \u043e \u0441\u0442\u043e\u043b\u0435. This is the prepositional case (\u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u043b\u043e\u0436\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043f\u0430\u0434\u0435\u0436), which was initially used to signify locations (\u00ab\u043d\u0430 \u0447\u0435\u043c? \u0432 \u0447\u0435\u043c? \u043f\u0440\u0438 \u0447\u0435\u043c?\u00bb) and now includes some other prepositions.\n\nAs you can see from this example, cases in a language usually have different meanings, and various verbs demand various cases depending on what you are trying to express. Some languages have less cases then Russian, some have more. English and Spanish do not have cases, but the traces of cases can be found in pronoun changes (I-me-my/mine, similar stuff in Spanish).\n\nTo figure out the cases in your target language, you have to dive into them, understand what they mean and how you are supposed to use them.

This is necessary to understand when you\u2019re figuring out how to use them correctly. I haven\u2019t ever seen or used \u2018paining\u2019, and almost all examples of its usage seem to be a misspelling of \u2018painting\u2019. \u2018Ache\u2019 has a derivative adjective \u2018achy\u2019, but it\u2019s not very common.\n\n\nMeanings:\n\n\u2022 Pain - any type of physical discomfort/suffering in a body part;\n\n\u2022 Hurt - the verb describes a process of something bringing you pain (\u201cmy hand hurts\u201d); the participle is used to say that a body part or a person received physical or emotional pain (\u201cMy hand was hurt in a fight\u201d, \u201cI was hurt by his words\u201d);\n\n\u2022 Sore, soreness - pain after something was used or touched (\u201cI worked out yesterday and now my muscles are sore\u201d);\n\n\u2022 Ache, achy - continuous dull pain (\u201cI have a headache\u201d).\n\n\nNow onto the examples.\n\n1 - \u2018ache\u2019 is used incorrectly here, you need an adjective, so it\u2019s either \u2018achy\u2019 or \u2018sore\u2019. It\u2019s better to use \u2018sore\u2019 here, since it is a more common word and describes pain received after using his back in his sleep.\n\n2 - Perfectly fine!\n\n3 - I would probably go with \u2018hurts\u2019 here, \u2018hurting\u2019 is usually reserved for emotional pain. If your body part is in pain, it\u2019s fine to say \u2018hurts\u2019.\n\n4 - Again, fine and probably a good example to illustrate the meaning of \u2018sore\u2019. A pain from some activity.\n\n5 - as pointed out earlier, \u2018paining\u2019 is not a good choice, people don\u2019t really use this word. You can either say \u201cyou are in pain\u201d or \u201cyou are hurting\u201d.\n\nAnswering the last question: if you are in pain regularly, usually because of an illness, you can say \u201cchronic pain\u201d. If you stabbed your toe, you should probably go with \u201cmy toe hurts\u201d.\n\n(edit: fixed paragraphs)", "created_utc": "1667652912.0", "edited": "1667653282.0", "id": "iv5ce6a", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_yms2kb", "parent_id": "t3_yms2kb", "score": "3", "subreddit": "EnglishLearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2u8ap"}, {"author": "LynxGlad", "body": "Ohhh, French and Korean seems to be a rather similar combination to mine in terms of linguistic difference, thank you for reassuring me.
