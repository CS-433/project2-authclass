(Put them as a range like 8 GCSEs grades 9-5. If you don't wanna show them off then you can leave it out. I dunno what's a \"good\" GCSE grade these days cuz I used the previous A*-G system.)\n\nSkills: say proficient in Microsoft Office. If what you wrote for the experience section makes the other soft skills obvious (like \"resourceful\"), then you can remove them\n\nInterests: I'd put your interests in a separate heading. Here, put \"interested in arts and creative fields\" (maybe expand a little bit about what you mean exactly), and \"reading\".\n\nFormatting: like people have been saying, left-align or justify your text.\n\nSo basically please please expand on your experience!
