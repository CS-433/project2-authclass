I am an FNP and currently split my time between Family Medicine and Pediatric Primary Care (different offices). Hopefully I can answer some of your questions.\n\n1. Yes, FNPs can work with children, even newborns. PNPs see children up to age 21 years. Most pediatric primary care clinics in my area hire FNPs. I suspect that is the case due to the limited supply of PNPs in my area as there is only one PNP program (acute and primary care) in my region that is 1.5 hrs away. Pediatric specialty clinics in my area prefer PNPs, especially if there is inpatient rounding.\n2. Your school nurse experience is not wasted as you'll likely see common childhood illnesses and injuries as well as familiarizing yourself with immunizations. Decent FNP and PNP programs look for at least 2 years of solid RN experience, preferably inpatient experience. This will help hone your assessment skills as well as expose you to a wide variety of diseases, medications, procedures, lab work, and imaging. It is important to have solid assessment skills and strong knowledge of pathophysiology and pharmacology before starting an NP program as there is an expectation that you already know the basics and have been applying them in practice.\n3. Part-time MSN programs are 3 years and full-time MSN programs are 2 years. If I remember correctly, part-time DNP programs are 4 - 5 years, and full-time DNP programs are 3 - 4 years.\n4. Post-master's certificates are for those who already hold an MSN and wish to add another NP specialty certification. For example, if someone is an FNP and wishes to work as a hospitalist, then he/she would enroll in a post-master's program for AGACNP or PNP-AC depending if they wish to care for children or adults.\n5. NP boards are pretty different from the NCLEX-RN. I felt the ANCC FNP exam was pretty straight forward. There are different question types, such as SATA. The FNP exam will test skills and knowledge in (medical) assessment, diagnosis, and management of common conditions found in the primary care setting. This is very different from the NCLEX-RN, which focuses more on the acute care setting and the scope of practice of an RN in that setting.", "created_utc": "1603139186.0", "edited": "1660338395.0", "id": "g9d4kpl", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_je5krz", "parent_id": "t3_je5krz", "score": "4", "subreddit": "nursepractitioner", "subreddit_id": "t5_2v7bm"}, {"author": "asystole00", "body": "Yes, she is!", "created_utc": "1602803271.0", "edited": "False", "id": "g8y5d6p", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_jbrcl8", "parent_id": "t1_g8xmq2a", "score": "3", "subreddit": "NewOrleans", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhp5"}, {"author": "asystole00", "body": "I went a FNP program that was part of university with a medical school along with other health professional programs.
