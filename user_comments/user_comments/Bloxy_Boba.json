If they toned it down, a child was watching it on their iPad and a parent came in, the parent might think the child is watching a kids\u2019 show, since it\u2019s a cartoon\n\nThat's more of the parents' responsibility then. I think it goes without saying that the makers of Hazbin Hotel have put content warnings on their videos, so I don't think that necessitates adding edgy content as another warning, especially if said edgy content isn't written well enough to attract an adult audience. And regardless, a lot of its audience is comprised of middle school aged children. So I don't know if that really worked or not.\n\n Just because a show has a lot of curse words and disturbing things, that doesn't mean adults are going to be gravitated towards it. I'd argue that Hazbin Hotel can't actually pin its main audience down that well given the writing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Age restrictions hardly work as well, for one, nobody uses their real birthday for their account, and two, even age-restricted videos get taken down, like the videos of Belle Delphine\u2019s YouTube\n\nThis is a good point. I should have kept in mind that TV and Youtube aren't comparable platforms of entertainment. YouTube really is a cruel place to start a show, and I commend Hazbin Hotel for getting as far as it did with just a pilot and comics.\n\nBut then again, I think there's a little bit of a contradiction here. So if I'm getting what you're saying, Hazbin Hotel uses edgy content to prevent young viewers from accessing it on accident and getting it removed... this sounds a bit counterintuitive seeing how videos with edgier content tend to get removed more often. Hell (pun intended), even mostly non-edgy videos get removed because the YouTube censorship system is so messed up. So fundamentally, wouldn't making the series more edgy make it harder for Hazbin Hotel to build an audience if more edgy content puts the show at risk of removal?", "created_utc": "1627487066.0", "edited": "False", "id": "h6ubsby", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_ot7hk1", "parent_id": "t1_h6u4b5z", "score": "3", "subreddit": "HazbinHotel", "subreddit_id": "t5_igfxt"}, {"author": "Bloxy_Boba", "body": "I agree with what you said for #3. Toriel doesn't have much if she's got both the king and the kingdom against her. Sure, she might have other queenly duties or something but the game doesn't go into it really, so neither should I.\n\n> I really don\u2019t think Toriel would be ok with taking any souls, considering the first thing she does when she returns to the castle is undo Asgore\u2019s policies and declare that all humans that fall into the underground will be treated as friends.\n\nI don't agree with this one completely. Although she does that in the neutral ending, in the pacifist ending she says that Asgore could've used one soul to cross the barrier and \"\\[take\\] six SOULS from the humans, then come back and freed everyone peacefully\". She is okay with taking souls, but even then so her reasoning is flawed... I don't think humans would respond well to a goat monster rising from the ground asking for souls.\n\n>She was more trying to point out that Asgore\u2019s heart wasn\u2019t in it, meaning that he knew it was was wrong and did it anyway.\n\nThat's the whole the point, though. He didn't want to kill children and use their souls, but he was left with no other viable option to save the monsters. \n\n>How exactly does Toriel act like she has the moral high ground over Asgore? \n\nHer dialogue at the pacifist ending says that:\n\n\"What a miserable creature, torturing such a poor, innocent youth... Do not be afraid, my child. It is I, Toriel, your friend and guardian.\" (after incapacitating Asgore)\n\n\"It is not right to sacrifice someone simply to let someone leave here.\" (a very moralizing tone, huh?)\n\nOh, and the worst of all... she calls Asgore a \"pathetic whelp\"! :(\n\n>Also, just because she\u2019s not perfect doesn\u2019t make anything she did comparable to being at least directly responsible for the death of six children and promising to wipe out humanity.\n\nHer actions may not be comparable, but she's a little responsible. To Frisk, she says \" It is I, Toriel, your friend and guardian,\" which is probably how she viewed herself to the six children. I think it goes without saying she wasn't that great of a guardian since they all died. And the only time she guards Frisk in the pacifist route is when they fight Asgore. You could say she's a friend, though.\n\n>I still say that Toriel is supposed to be a pacifist, and at the very least is not willing to fight her own subjects. It just doesn\u2019t make sense for her to do the things she does otherwise.\n\nThis makes sense. In the original post I think you said \"*But, at the same time, Toriel is a pretty staunch pacifist, don\u2019t use violence unless it\u2019s absolutely necessary and never ever kill and such*\" and personally, I do not think it's absolutely necessary to launch fireballs at children. She wasn't intending to kill Frisk, but... really? Fireballs? At a 9-year-old??? Girl I'm losing myself over that.\n\n>Following the kids out of the ruins would have most likely necessitated violence. (Again, to leave the underground you must have a human and monster soul. What would be the point of risking the end of the safety of the ruins to um\u2026walk to the barrier and walk back? Things had changed pretty significantly when Frisk got there. It\u2019s said to have been a long time since the last human fell down, and Frisk is the final soul.) \n\nThat's true. Toriel would've had to face violence if she left the ruins, and her choosing to stay makes me a little mad... like she sees herself as a guardian but she doesn't wanna guard??? Being a guardian means that you'd have to walk to the barrier and back to protect who you're supposed to be protecting. \n\n>To her, the most moral option was to avoid the other monsters and stay in the ruins (she doesn\u2019t have a high opinion of the peacemaking abilities of the monsters out there, after all.)\n\nSo it's moral for her to stay away from monsters and protect herself over the children? This makes me dislike Toriel more!!!\n\n>That\u2019s who Toriel is, she sticks to her principles, even to a fault\n\nI don't think she sticks to her principles completely given the fireball situation, but I'd say she tries her best. I'm not expecting perfection from Toriel... it's just I have a hard time liking her based off what I said above.\n\n(I hope this response doesn't come across too aggressive.

Exactly. Even though she's the queen, she isn't \\*responsible\\* for Asgore. It's also likely that she did this already, given her personality.\n2. 100% true, she isn't obligated to be with him and has every right to feel the way she does about what Asgore's doing.\n3. I'm a little tied on this one. I understand that the monster populace most likely wouldn't listen to her, but that doesn't warrant her just leaving. Even if she tried really hard and it may have seemed hopeless, at the end of the day, she's still the queen. No queen, or any other ruler, should leave the people they're meant to protect regardless if they agree with her or not. I'm pretty sure there are more royal duties a queen has to fulfill besides deciding how to deal with fallen humans.\n4. 100% agree, the point doesn't make sense for her character nor the plot.\n5. 1000% agree. Toriel would not put up with Sans's laziness. Besides their shared love of puns, their personalities are not compatible in my opinion.\n6. I wouldn't use the word \"mean\" to describe it.  I think that word doesn't encapsulate much. What annoyed me more with Toriel is that she put herself on a moral high ground against Asgore. She does have a right to feel upset at him and not forgive him, but at the same time she failed to protect the other children and even went as far as to shoot fire balls at Frisk for disobeying. She's got a lot of contempt for someone who did bad things to children as if she didn't endanger a child's life too, if not multiple by not giving her all to keep them alive like she promised. You could argue that letting the children leave the Ruins is her respecting their freedom, but that doesn't mean much when she doesn't help them besides letting them leave. The goat woman's got books and food and whatnot. By just letting them run out it's a death wish, so if she's going to respect their freedom she should've at least tried to help them survive it as well. In short, Toriel shouldn't have been acting like she's morally superior to Asgore when she's already got a lot of skeletons in the closet (pun intended). She's being hypocritical. \n7. I have a bone to pick with this one (pun intended again). If she's such as pacifist, why does she shoot fireballs at Frisk??? Isn't Frisk like 9 years old or something? Being a disobedient child doesn't necessitate immolation. If she was staying in the Ruins to avoid violence, then that didn't work. Also, she should have totally followed the kids out of the Ruins if she truly wanted to keep them alive. She's essentially a mother figure for the fallen humans. And it doesn't seem very motherly for her to let them leave and not look for them immediately. By staying in the Ruins, she's saying that she values non-violence over protecting them. (At the same time, however, I get that the story needs to progress without her at some point so I'll just let this one go.)\n8. 10000% agree. Alphys is an irresponsible scientist. She needed to be fired.\n\nFundamentally, I'm just mad at Toriel for acting like she's better than Asgore when they're both no better than the other in terms of morality. She isn't an evil witch, and she hasn't wronged Asgore in any significant way. Though, if we're comparing personalities... Asgore's is better by far. But that's not what we're talking about here, and even if we were, I wouldn't change my stance! >:(", "created_utc": "1627479727.0", "edited": "False", "id": "h6tv20a", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_ot5mei", "parent_id": "t3_ot5mei", "score": "3", "subreddit": "Undertale", "subreddit_id": "t5_2xdht"}, {"author": "Bloxy_Boba", "body": "I\u2019d have to agree with this one, but the humor and dialogue could use a lot of work\u2026 I\u2019ve heard many people say it tries too hard to be edgy / overindulges in curse words to the point that even though it\u2019s considered an adult cartoon it attracts a fanbase of mostly middle school aged kids.
