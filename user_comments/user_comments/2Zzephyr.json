On the other hand, 4 Echoes' Flat DMG Bonus can scale much better with the weapon\u2019s DMG% and other existing buffs, hence 4 Echoes becomes the best artifact set for the first category of weapons mentioned above.\n\nHowever, the same cannot be said when considering weapons that do not give DMG% or NA DMG%. Because Jade Cutter and the other non-DMG% bonus weapons do not provide DMG% bonuses to Ayato, DMG% sources from artifact sets become more valuable over the Flat DMG Bonus from 4 Echoes. A typical Ayato\u2019s only source of DMG% when running these weapons is 46.6% from a hydro goblet, excluding any other outside buffs, thus Ayato will still benefit from additional DMG% and a 4 Echoes Ayato would see less DMG% multipliers and consequently less DPS. Thus, 4 HoD (15%+30%) becomes the best option when paired with the non-DMG% weapons mentioned above.\n\nNote that 4pc Glad performs well for solo Ayato calculations but can lose out in value when stacked with other buffs like Yun Jin and Bennett.

What you summon matters, if it's a single boss, if it's trash, if the targets moving or standing still, if you yourself need to move or not. There's ifrit's gapcloser to work around of. There's also the shield, a really handy shield, that you're locked out of during summoning, so you have to keep track of that too. \nIt doesn't matter much in regular content, but gosh it feels good to optimize your summons in extreme/savage prog. To analyze mechanics and work around it. Basically, just like any other job does during prog!\n\nPeople who think there is no gap between average players and great players have not looked twice at summoner. It might be an easy job for most people to get into, optimizing to be great still exists just like any other job. BLM's rotation is piss easy. It's the same thing. A job isn't all about the rotation but what you do with it to work around what's happening. Your own placement. Etc.\n\nHonestly, I was a RDM main before, and now I can't bring myself to touch it.

It makes it really special. \nAnd earning spells is fun because it's varied. Some of it you can just chill solo, go at your pace, and some of them you have to group up. I don't know but seeing a party of 8 blue mages makes my heart burst. The job story is also one of my favorite so far. 60-70 is amazing. And the masked carnivals on top of that!

I haven't done any other relics yet. Castrum blew my mind by the way. The way you have to coordinate between parties is such a feels good when done flawlessly.

So I'll join in and add what I wanted to say.\n\nIt's not just the fact that we know the monsters from the previous games, and that they've gotten used to buttons and gotten better. ( And if they doubt it's a thing, I invite them to look at people who never played games in their lives and then try their first game. Those people can't even use the camera at the same time as running, or press two buttons at the same time. Those are basic skills that we've mastered years ago. Then we had to master MH's unique controls on top of that ).\n\nBut yeah, it's not just that: it's the quality of life upgrades we've had. The mobility, the counters, the better hitboxes etc. They see it as being easy on players, instead of huge important improvements for a hunting game.\n\nThe hunting style simply has shifted, and they're basically bitter nostalgic people. Instead of realizing they can enjoy both \"styles\", old and new one, like I do.\n\nThe old \"style\" was limited movement, limited weapon moves, limited everything. They think it was \"unforgiving and rightfully punishing\" but in reality it was that way because of limitations. Sometimes it was because of shitty hitboxes, aka frustrating, sometimes it was rightfully bad placement on your own part. You also had to do tons of stuff that weren't absolutely necessary for hunting game. But the new \"style\" allows much more focused on actually hunting and having the freedom to do so in countless ways. It's so fluid now and so alive. You can get so creative too. Also, Rise has no Grank yet. And if they complain about it, they should remember the issues capcom faced and the pandemic. They should also compare the beginning of World vs beginning of Rise. Rise is already much better and has so much more charm, the charm Monster Hunter games have that World quieted down because it wanted to appeal world wide.\n\nAnyway, both old games and new games are satisfying and fun. If they disagree and want old style, they can play old games.\n\nAnd I'm also bad with words so I hope what I wrote made sense.

You don't have to stick to one weapon type at all.\n\nTo know which one it'll be in a new game... it's simply a \"click\" feeling when trying them out.

Then later, I also tried Charge Blade for the same reason. It clicked too. I mained them the entire game and iceborne.

I can't even tell you what felt different at all. I just no longer enjoyed it as much. It was the same feeling as hammer in MHW all over again.  \n>  \n>So I pondered again. I thought about the weapons I always wanted to main in old games. Amongst them was HH and GL. So I tried both, and the Hunting Horn won Immediately. It just happened in a instant click, and now I'm having a blast.I've yet to click with a second main weapon, but I'm not pressed. I know I'll have a side of GS and Bow like other games too anyway.\n\nI see a pattern. Every time in a new game, I tried a weapon that always intrigued me before but never clicked (or could play). Yet when I finally try them in a new game, it clicked. So think of that weapon that always intrigued you, and try it out. See if it clicks.It's ok to not feel good with our old weapons, your new ones will fill that void immediately.\n\nAnd don't worry about sucking at them. There's plenty tutorials coming out!

And also not every F2P pulls for meta either, many pull for the character's story or design because they simply like them.\n\nI think F2P are easily baited from youtubers, or even videos on here, going like \"Must get!! XX is so broken!!\" (Despite the fact that it's the point to release stronger and stronger characters over time) to get views, while in reality any character has potential, there's just factors to reach it :\n\nWeapon, Artifacts, Ascension, Constellation, Team Synergy....it all matters greatly for a character, sure, but not only! So many forget that YOU control the character. If you like the gameplay of a character, you're more likely to have fun and either forget about numbers because you couldn't care less Or master them on your own Or watch tutorials to master the character. And all of that equals having even more fun. But if a character's gameplay just doesn't click, you won't perform as good as everyone else.\n\nWhich is my overall point : F2P players should aim to have fun. And that fun factor changes from person to person. For some it's big numbers, as much as f2p allows it, for some it's simply to play a favorite character regardless of performance. Some are in the middle, like me.\n\nYou can't have every characters, so you should really focus on those you REALLY like, either gameplay or design wise, or both ( and not just like them a little). This way you'll save a lot and be guaranteed for your most wanted characters.\n\nI started playing day1 but had a break later before coming back :\n\n\u2022 I pulled Albedo for story + gameplay + design\n\n\u2022 I pulled Xiao for story + gameplay + design\n\n\u2022 When I pulled Jean, i was totally okay with it because i liked her design and story. Now i can't play without her because of her fun gameplay.\n\n\u2022 I will save and pull for Baizhu regardless of his gameplay, because he's one my favorite characters (for his intriguing story, personality and design) alongside the others above (and some others i don't have like Zhongli).\n\nIf you need an example of making decisions ;\nRight now, to me, Hu Tao wasn't ever a hard decision to skip, even if i like her design and her fun personality.\nMy reflection : having Xiao, one of my favs, i don't want a new polearm character any time soon, nor do I need a new main DPS. Her gameplay is ok, her dash seems fun and animations are really good, but her burst doesn't appeal to me at all. Even if I like her story and design, it's an easy skip for me.\n(I actually didn't have to think about it since I'm saving for Baizhu no matter what, but if Baizhu didn't exist, this is what makes thoughts would look like)\n\nIn short : reflect if you really badly want a character. Get that notepad going, all the while forgetting about whale youtubers. Do you have the ressources for after you pull them? If not, will you have fun farming for those ressources? Do you really like their gameplay? How did you feel in the trial, did it click? How high are they in your liked character list (if this is a factor that matters to you)\n\nEtc etc. You really have to think about your 5* pulls as f2p, after considering your ressources, your time, the fun you'd have or not\n\nAnd the most important thing to remember : this is a video game. You can't lose yourself to a bunch of pixels. If you have a badly wanted character that you can't \"survive\" without, save save save and don't ever pull until they get their banner.\n\nThis is why leaks are important for a gacha game. The secrecy regarding upcoming characters (as in, which months will they be released) is very intentional from mihoyo, to catch people off guard and make them spend money.

Most of the time you can't make a weapon or one piece of armor from 1 kill. You have to farm and farm. Then you attempt a new monster, and the farm repeats. All of that until you reach endgame, then the farm is for different reasons.\n\nThe reason we veterans love MH is because every single monsters are unique and have incredible set moves that over time you learn to counter or dodge to the perfect frame to make it satisfying. Learning monsters and adapting during the hunts is what makes it so fun and enjoyable. It's incredible.\nAnd the teamwork from other players and the overall community is I think one of the best. (At least it was a decade ago, when MH wasn't as big as now in Europe and USA)", "created_utc": "1612479823.0", "edited": "False", "id": "gm1rpoh", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_lcsbp3", "parent_id": "t3_lcsbp3", "score": "5", "subreddit": "MonsterHunter", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rron"}, {"author": "2Zzephyr", "body": "Thank you so much for speaking up, I wanted to do it too hours ago but I was too tired, mentally and physically, and gave up.\n\nI saw the post again and checked to see if anyone had commented about it and was happily surprised by your comment.\n\nI don't have OCD but I do have other mental illnesses that are taken too lightly or made \"quirky\" by people.

But since I didn't, let's have a summary of my pulls since I started playing to make up for it : \n\nSo, I'm F2P and I started playing at launch, then had a break during Klee banner due to IRL, then came back in 1.2 with Albedo. I was R23 when I came back, and finally ready to do... well... everything! \n\nI looked up Albedo, his gameplay and story, and was enamoured. I had to get him! And so leveled and farmed a lot for him and it took me around 80 pulls to get him, literally at one day left of the banner (my old pulls from launch helped. I only got Qiqi back then). \n\nPulling so much for him also got me Sucrose and Bennett, all the way up to C5 Sucrose and C2 Bennett. All 3 of them are still my mains now! \n\nThen I continued to do as much as I could every day, farming for primogems as rumors of Xiao became louder and louder. And god I love Xiao, from his design to his gameplay, and I am so invested in his story. Good news was that I was totally uninterested by Ganyu, so I skipped her and farmed on.\n\nThen, just before 1.3 the Xiao banner 4* is revealed, and I see that there's Beidou, so I was happy! I always wanted her, and remembering my luck with Albedo's 4* banner, at least I wasn't worried about not getting her.\n\nWhen 1.3 went live yesterday, I had 76 wishes ready.\n\nSince my last 5* pull was Albedo, and I didn't do any pulls after that, I was so scared my 76 wishes wouldn't be enough. For weeks I dreaded the update to see my pulls results. I kept reminding myself that gacha games are ruthless, to not hope for much. That the only way for a guaranteed Xiao is 180 pulls and I don't have that.\n\nAnd since I am European, the update went live at 3AM. I wake up at 6AM because my brain is too hype and anxious. Yeah it does that\n\nI make my breakfast, start PC, and my cat cuddles me in my arms, resting on my desk in front of my keyboard. I decide to go \"fuck it\" and pull. But since it's 6AM, I'm half asleep, and not expecting much, I decide not to record as I originally planned to.\n\n10, I skip the animation, I get Beidou! I'm already super hype, since I plan to use Beidou later on\n\n20, I skip again, I get Diona and a 4* bow. Hmm. Couldn't care less about Diona, but still feels nice to have more characters as F2P.\n\n30, I skip once more as it's so early in the pulls still so I don't expect much until soft pity. And there my jaw drops: Xiao AND Beidou. \n\nI freak out. It really felt like I was being rewarded for all my hard work leveling and farming for primogems. It felt unreal, like I was still dreaming. \n\nI spent the whole day farming for the jades with my best friend to ascend him, and got him 70 in one day. Today I got him to 80. My only 80 with Albedo. And finally, finally I have a main DPS. I can finally kill stuff fast. His gameplay is just as good and fun as I expected!\n\nSo here you go, to anyone wanting to read this! I am beyond happy and F2P players' joy really is worth sharing because too many hardcore players or whales forget what it's like. \n\nThough what I couldn't bear watching is F2P putting in so much work and not getting their wanted 5*. It's just so sad and depressing. My best friend had way less wishes than me, also F2P, and didn't get Xiao. But she has Ganyu, and as she's new to games and is on phone, so I think Ganyu is amazing for her.\n\n( As a useless note, I did my pulls at the Wangshu Inn, where we meet Xiao for the first time :') )", "created_utc": "1612476822.0", "edited": "False", "id": "gm1kw7o", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_lc0flk", "parent_id": "t3_lc0flk", "score": "3", "subreddit": "Genshin_Impact", "subreddit_id": "t5_12p4l2"}, {"author": "2Zzephyr", "body": "Oh it won't last long as I've recently reached Rank 43 and not looking forward into spending more resin than before lmao\n\nThough what I also hate is the low number of Hero's wit drops :( If I farm for artifacts and all, how can they expect me to farm leylines :(", "created_utc": "1612470619.0", "edited": "False", "id": "gm15lye", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_lcohrr", "parent_id": "t1_gm11s8j", "score": "6", "subreddit": "Genshin_Impact", "subreddit_id": "t5_12p4l2"}, {"author": "2Zzephyr", "body": "Reading the comments makes me thankful for not having been there during that event lmao.
