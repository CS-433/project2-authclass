Also, try not to fall for the trick of e.g. \"pfff I already know how to use ~\u304b\u3089, I am not going to bother with the exercises\". It is the brain being lazy. I had math students who said that to me. When i asked them to do their exercises and prove it, they could not. They did not lie, they truly thought they could do them. Same situation with the kanjis and me, i already know \u4ed5\u4e8b  (\u3057\u3054\u3068) but can I truly recall and write the kanji? Most of the time the answer is...maybe? \n\nSometimes, it takes me more than 2 days to go through a lesson and that is fine. I know I am not perfect and I have other things to do in my life.  Sometimes I also feel overwhelmed or my brain says enough for today. Today I did not study as much as I would like to and that's fine, i am not a machine. Progress is not linear either. You do not just improve constantly, sometimes you double think what you learnt, which is also fine. This gives you the opportunity to revision your material.\n\nI do not compare myself with the people you described because each person's condition/situation is different. Someone might be moving to Japan, another one might be already exposed to Japanese and living there, others might be doing their studies in Japanese. People, who usually post on social media, do not usually let you see what's behind the scenes or why they managed to hit N1 in a year.  There are so many other people learning japanese and they are doing great. Of course the outliers will stand out.\n\nWhat matters is \"me today\" vs \"me a month ago\" or \"3 month ago\". I compare myself with my old self and I aim to be better. I am still here...after 3 months and I have not given up. I can read 350+kanjis and I can make a compound sentence (Because of A, B) and I am happy. I used to learn French up to A2 level and my japanese is not far from that level I think, it makes me happy. Even George said that people give up before lesson X ( can't remember which) so I am already in front of most people who tried to learn Japanese and have given up (thank you George for this encouraging message).
