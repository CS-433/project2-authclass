Judges are appointed. After set periods of time, they are up for retainer, not election. If you vote \u201cno\u201d and the majority votes the same way, that judge loses their judgeship. Judges don\u2019t run for their judgeship in this state. \n\n2. Judges can\u2019t change the charges. They can only decide to accept a plea agreement or not. If the DA charged misdemeanors, the judge can\u2019t just make it a felony. If the judge rejects a plea agreement, often this means blowing up a deal the parties may have worked out for very specific reasons. In many cases, a judge rejecting a plea agreement means the case will be forced to trial and there\u2019s a legitimate risk of acquittal. In that case, the asshole rapist cop is found NOT GUILTY and KEEPS HIS JOB. Is 90 days jail and a conviction on a misdemeanor better than that, when we can now keep this predator off the police force?\n\n3. DAs charge what they can. I have never seen a DA handling a rape case cut the defendant a break just because they were a cop. It\u2019s RAPE. I\u2019m shocked people here just assume that the DA or judge thought \u201coh, it\u2019s no big deal.\u201d  I\u2019m pretty confident the DA felt the same outrage y\u2019all do. \n\n4.

Dollars to donuts the poor woman raped would not, could not, or should not testify in that rape trial. Knowing this, the DA likely had a similar choice to make as referenced above: should I force this case to trial and possibly cause and re-victimize this woman at the substantial risk this asshole is acquitted? Or do I offer misdemeanors so I get at least something? Id be interested in reading the transcript of the sentencing hearing for this case. The only other reasonable explanation is that he knew something else about the feds\u2026.\n\n5. The feds, by their own admission, cherry pick the cases they want to throw their resources into. Sometimes they actually help state cases. The feds do not fuck around. They have virtually unlimited resources and unlimited time.
