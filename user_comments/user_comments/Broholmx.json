Generalising across an entire platform of thousands of language learning content creators is not productive. If there are certain creators that you feel are downright scamming or severely misrepresenting their abilities in order to sell their coaching or courses, feel free to call them out on a case by case basis. Calling it \"YouTube Polyglots\" makes it seem systemic, which I do not believe for a second based on my own subscriptions of YouTube polyglots who never pretend to be better than they are. I did interview some 100+ polyglots, so I believe I have some experience in this matter.\n2. Stepping back for a second, I'm also not even buying the premise of unrealistic expectations ruining language learning for people. Because I think, that this this subset of learners might never have even given it a try in the first place, so at the very worst you give people a small taste of what language learning could be. If you convey language learning as impossibly difficult, and you need special language genes and finish learning the language by age 7, those people would have never started - so it doesn't matter you were being kind and realistic - the final outcome is the same. It's a bit like socialism. Lots of good intentions, but the only true measure of policy is what happens when they are implemented. Likewise, I would argue strongly that even the most dubious of  YouTube polyglots with significant audiences have done more for multilingualism than almost any figure, institution, or school in history. Take Moses McCormic for example, he didn't know much beyond 10 set phrases in most of his languages (with the noticeable exception of Chinese due to his ex-wife) yet his stuff is incredibly motivational for getting out there, trying your early skills, and getting some EXPs and leveling up in the language (all good for long-term progress) - did you hate him selling courses too?\n3. At the end of the day YouTube is an entertainment platform, and while you can definitely learn something on it, you should never take it more seriously than you personally feel like is appropriate. It's not like anyone is forcing anyone to watch or enjoy the content. \n4. I see the YouTube polyglots (to use your generalisation) as a bit like the Duolingo of content.

Who am I?\n\nUltimately, I find that blaming video games as a source for all your troubles is like blaming McDonalds for obesity - yes, it can certainly contribute, but the overarching problems stem from within, and they must be addressed from there.\n\nOtherwise, you'll just end up replacing gaming with something else and get no further in life.\n\nWhat I've learned over many years of misery, depression, obesity, and addiction is that it all really comes down to balance.\n\nNo activity is healthy to do to the point where it has negative effects on your health, career, relationships, or other goals you want to achieve.\n\nThere is nothing inherently or fundamentally wrong with video games, but they may \"expose\" our own internal weaknesses, insecurities, and anger - which then gets misinterpreted (oh League of Legends makes me so ANGRY!) - no, it doesn't. You make yourself angry because your life is a mess, and the only way to exercise ANY resemblance of control and superiority is to lash out at other players.\n\nOn a related note, I'm actually starting to believe that part of the reason that people get anxious about video game play, is because it's so easy to see how many hours we have spent in it.\n\nAlmost no other activities in life has this \"feature\" - the only one that comes close is phone time, but you don't see it for gardening, watching TV, talking to friends, cleaning and chores, basically everything else.\n\nAnd in that lies another point, life should never be about fully optimising every single hour of every single day. It's about letting yourself disconnect at times, take a breather, forget meetings, TPS reports, and all other nonsense, and just immerse yourself in a virtual world.\n\nSome people do this with books, some people with TV/movies, and some people do it with video games. Absolutely no shame or harm in that.\n\n\\*\\*Important Disclaimer: There is such a thing as real video game addiction at the level of alcohol and substance addiction where people are completely unable to stop playing to the detriment of their relationships, careers, and health.

I mean, come on. If you're a business owner you want to advertise and promote your products, right? There are ads everywhere for just about every category of products and services - why should the game developers not have them?\n\nPlus, a list like this could be made for virtually anything.

The temptations will always be there, and if somehow miraculously all your points were \"fixed\"  people would just get \"addicted\" to pokemon red again, or whatever game was available to them.\n\nIt's the same for fast food addictions.

Depending on how recent it was, these may actually be withdrawal symptoms - so you feel like you need to be more \"prescriptive\" to justify your own thoughts, and you probably have some degree of jealousy towards people who are able to do their hobbies (whether gaming or otherwise) in moderation.\n\nOne huge positive thing I would say though, is that discovering these ideas and thoughts at your age will be extremely beneficial, and if you apply that same level of enthusiasm and passion for something else you will be extremely successful.\n\nAll the best,", "created_utc": "1655563970.0", "edited": "False", "id": "icu5xei", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_venam9", "parent_id": "t3_venam9", "score": "2", "subreddit": "StopGaming", "subreddit_id": "t5_2tjkc"}, {"author": "Broholmx", "body": "She is very aggressively fighting back, going for his face and eyes - did you not see that?", "created_utc": "1654815242.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ibsfbvn", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_v8er05", "parent_id": "t1_ibsf1cy", "score": "2", "subreddit": "therewasanattempt", "subreddit_id": "t5_39ne7"}, {"author": "Broholmx", "body": "You're completely squeezing him off the track?", "created_utc": "1654755755.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ibpcbiw", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_v898am", "parent_id": "t3_v898am", "score": "2", "subreddit": "F1Game", "subreddit_id": "t5_33sdn"}, {"author": "Broholmx", "body": "Disagree.

Homelessness is a complex issue, and so nobody is probably fitting perfectly in either of the three groups.\n\n1. Veterans - These are heroes. They have been abandoned by the very country they served with their life, and they must be saved at all costs. No matter the price. Whether it's psychological, psychiatric, or whatever - no resource can be spared.\n2. The \"bad break\" group - these guys were trying to do their best, but due to an unlucky break, circumstances, medical situation, whatever the reason they lost everything and ended up homeless. Usually grateful and accepting of assistance, and would get back on their feet relatively fast with the right support. Dependancy likely, but not always.\n3. People, often with criminal and destructive tendencies, who are fundamentally homeless by choice, by not accepting any support, or assistance, because of the rules enforced at the shelters, or because they prefer their lawless, free existence. Higher probability of one or more dependancies.\n\nI'm NOT saying that any of the above groups should not be helped, but you cannot criticise a homeless programme of a state or community if 100% of the homeless were offered assistance but only 50% of them accepted it.\n\nAt some point there has to be consequences of individual choice.\n\nHomeless camps destroy community areas, making them no-go zones in most cases - so that in itself is a complete non starter. While we definitely have to help the people impacted by homelessness, we can't let it be at the cost of other people who are just trying to be in the community also.\n\nBut, with all that said - what can be done with all that said?\n\nHow can group 3 be motivated to accept more help, and what can we do more to improve the success of all groups?\n\nThrowing more money at the problem?

Even at a 10% winrate disparity (which is arguably ridiculous) you're still looking at 400 games to go up 2k MMR\n\nMy argument ultimately boils down to this: The matchmaking system could be more sophisticated, which would deter account buying and selling, and reward players who improve faster and give more balanced games as a consequence. \n\nI don't have the exact solutions or technical knowledge on how to implement them, but don't tell me a company such a valve does not have any data scientists or engineers on payroll to come up with something 100x more clever than the current implementation if they bothered.

Speeding up the process. Shortcuts to the normal time Google takes to appreciate and understand how valuable your website is supposed to be (or not be).\n\nAnyway, that wasn't the main point.
