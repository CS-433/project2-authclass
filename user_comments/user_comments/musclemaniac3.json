Be honest with yourself, how handsome are you, how ripped / tall are you. If you aren't at least an 8 as a guy in looks, get off dating apps, you'd do better on Instagram and real life. You have to understand that most girls are on there for validation and if you aren't getting comments like \"I never meet up with anyone on here but I really like you and wanna go out with you\" just get off the apps. If you don't get **at least a hundred matches** within the first month on a dating app, delete it. If you have to pay to get a good number of matches, delete it.\n2. **Have an Abundant Mindset** Understand it's a numbers game/ game of luck. The more matches the better. Look **here's a rule of thumb:** if you don't set up a date/ see the girl you match with within a one- week period, cut it off. She's just using you for attention at that point/ doesn't have high enough interest. Trust me, most average people have free time to spend, if she doesn't see you within a week cut her off. Don't spend too much time on each girl. Have the mindset that you're not ever gonna see the majority of the girls you match with in real life. A lot of times girls do like you and are interested but they're really busy or they don't like you enough for you to be a top pritority.", "created_utc": "1663709681.0", "edited": "1663709904.0", "id": "ip8zieq", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_xj2c1m", "parent_id": "t3_xj2c1m", "score": "1", "subreddit": "seduction", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhrv"}, {"author": "musclemaniac3", "body": "Yes I'd be down to know I'd love it if we PM'd each other.", "created_utc": "1663099788.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ioaw5ax", "is_submitter": "True", "link_id": "t3_xcxi2d", "parent_id": "t1_io9j968", "score": "1", "subreddit": "Entrepreneur", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qldo"}, {"author": "musclemaniac3", "body": "thank you good sir", "created_utc": "1662993400.0", "edited": "False", "id": "io4ll85", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_xb2nag", "parent_id": "t1_inx4v20", "score": "1", "subreddit": "AirForceRecruits", "subreddit_id": "t5_2q94jn"}, {"author": "musclemaniac3", "body": "Ohh okay so airman first class", "created_utc": "1662851144.0", "edited": "False", "id": "inx1gug", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_xb2nag", "parent_id": "t1_inx0znv", "score": "4", "subreddit": "AirForceRecruits", "subreddit_id": "t5_2q94jn"}, {"author": "musclemaniac3", "body": "are you gonna sit in a room all day with the doors locked working on assignments?", "created_utc": "1662754181.0", "edited": "False", "id": "inrqd39", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_xa436f", "parent_id": "t3_xa436f", "score": "25", "subreddit": "college", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3z"}, {"author": "musclemaniac3", "body": "You shouldn't have too many female friends as a straight guy.
