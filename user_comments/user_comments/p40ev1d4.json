I know that we should just worry about getting our point to the other person, but I always try to change the way I'm saying things in order to use more comfortable terms and such (in order not to make mistakes - even though it obviously doesn't always work), and this is difficult to achieve when you're talking with someone face to face. With texting, you have plenty of time to change the way you're trying to say something.\n\nI'm not really sure how much of a requirement for jobs in Portugal English is since I'm actually a student.

Besides that, I have barely spoken any English here, but I can imagine that those who live in big cities have (which is not my case).\n\nBooks in Portuguese are indeed a lot more expensive, but it is clear to see why once you pick one up. The pages, the cover, almost everything overall look more expensive than the \"common\" paperback books written in English.
