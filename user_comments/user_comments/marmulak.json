Yes, it does, but the reason why people end up calling for revolution or regime change in the first place is because the system is engineered so that debates and discussion on these issues remain only that.

It seems like Arabic is the most complicated/difficult of the languages in the region, but I'd like to argue against this with a couple points:\n\nFirst, some people when they think of Arabic, they think of classical Arabic like what's in the Qur'an. This language is more difficult and complicated than the Arabic that's spoken today, and classical Arabic is still artificially kept alive in the form of MSA, but nobody really speaks that. You would learn it in school like if Spanish speakers today learned Latin in school, but nobody speaks Latin anymore, and Spanish is clearly much easier and simpler than Latin. Arabic today is also more simple and easy than it used to be.\n\nSecond, when voting for Turkish, I think people get fooled by Turkish because it *seems* easy at first. Like yeah, no grammatical gender (sweet), and simple sentences are easy to understand. The agglutination also feels easy at first because the basic principles are simple. If you only know ten Turkish words, and then you learn five suffixes, it's like nice all of the sudden you now know 50+ Turkish words, but holy shit it gets more complicated the further you go.\n\nI took courses to study Turkish, and it's hard. It's harder than Persian by a long shot, and they are already very similar so as someone who knew Persian well, Turkish should have been the next easiest language for me. It felt that way at first too. Then what happens is, it keeps getting more complex... and it never stops. Like, Persian has about as many verb tenses as English does. In Turkish when I was like two or three semesters in I thought I had learned all the verb tenses, but until the very end our textbooks kept teaching us new verb tenses in every unit that I never thought could have existed. So you have the crap-ton of tenses, the agglutination starts getting more and more complicated, which gives you headaches with spelling and word formations (how do I put these 10 suffixes together??), and OH MY GOD sentence structure. See, all this time I didn't even mention the hardest part of Turkish yet. Simple sentences in Turkish are a breeze. A bunch of sentences you can translate literally word for word into Persian and they're correct in Persian also, but once a sentence starts getting a little complicated, it starts morphing into this bizarre alien language that you could never imagine possible. Like, seriously it's mind-bending and I never learned it properly even after studying Turkish for a couple years. Persian sentences can be pretty messed up too because of the SOV word order, but at a certain point the overall structure of sentences (like with multiple clauses) still behaves like an English speaker would expect, but Turkish no.\n\nAs an English speaker, Arabic sentence structure is so easy to understand it's never been an issue for me. Feels totally natural. Arabic also doesn't have too complicated verb tenses. It's kind of an easy language by comparison. Yeah, Arabic has gender and a couple tricky inflections in certain types of phrases, but it's just a little spice to make Arabic flavorful, whereas Turkish is like from Mars or something. I would not wish it on my enemies.\n\nEdit: I also want to say that the way people choose to answer this question is also affected by culture. Arabic is stereotyped as a difficult or complicated language and Arabs like to say this too because in their view it's something to take pride in. Turkish culture is different; they like to say their language is simple/easy/regular and they feel that's something to be proud of. So part of our perception of which language is more difficult is a little based on propaganda too.", "created_utc": "1663424053.0", "edited": "1663424303.0", "id": "iosrnwc", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_xgbu3y", "parent_id": "t3_xgbu3y", "score": "3", "subreddit": "AskMiddleEast", "subreddit_id": "t5_vkfjx"}, {"author": "marmulak", "body": "I have met a lot of Arabic speakers who learned Persian in Iran, and they learn it quickly. All the foreign nationals in Iran who were Arabic speakers I met were fluent in Persian, even if their proficiency was not very high they just didn't have a problem with speaking and fundamental communication. They seem like they can learn it well enough to live in Iran within a year, maybe six months? Again I'm not saying they're experts in the language, but they adapt.\n\nI have a lot less experience with Persian speakers who have learned Arabic. In Iran it seemed very rare, and I ran across a couple people here and there who were fluent Arabic speakers (having learned it as a second language after Persian), and it was almost shocking to me. The shock is because in Iran even though people are basically forced to study Arabic for years in school, and a bunch of people even get a degree in it in university, it's not the spoken Arabic of today; all they do is learn to read classical Arabic and they simply memorize grammar rules so they can read specific texts like the Qur'an. This means that basically nobody in Iran knows Arabic except for a few exceptional people (aside from the Iranian Arabs themselves, obviously, because it's their mother tongue).\n\nHowever, setting all that aside, Arabic is still one of the languages that is not so hard for Persian speakers to learn. The main problem is that Persian and Arabic speakers don't normally need or want to learn each other's languages, so the hardest part could just be convincing them to do it. Persian speakers have an easier time with Arabic because they already know loads of vocabulary. I studied Persian literature in university, and to my surprise I occasionally start reading a text written in Arabic and I don't realize it's not Persian until I get like halfway though the sentence and I'm like, \"Wait a minute...\"\n\nSo Persian speakers have advantages in familiarity with vocab, the alphabet and spelling, shared regional culture, and SOME aspects of the grammar that overlap. What makes Arabic really hard for Persian speakers are features which Arabic has that Persian lacks, like gender, sounds in pronunciation, and maybe one or two other things. Arabic grammar is more complex than Persian grammar and so is Arabic morphology, but believe it or not Persian speakers in Iran are already somewhat familiar with Arabic morphology (some of it, but not all of it, is used in Persian) and grammar.\n\nAll things being equal, I agree with the idea that Arabs learn Persian faster than Persians learn Arabic. However, in the long run it might take them both equally long to get *really good* at the other language. I know Arabs who lived in Iran for years and years and their Persian while praiseworthy is kind of at a low level still. They don't tend to take much of an interest in the literature or depth of it. It's not unlike what happens when Arabs learn English. They have great verbal communication skills, but might not be able to pass a high school English class.\n\nAs an aside, I think the Persian spoken in Iran sometimes places a little more emphasis on the commonalities between Persian and Arabic, so Arabs might find Persian in Iran particularly easy because Iranians are sometimes going out of their way to use Arabic words where a Persian word exists, like \u0627\u0633\u0645 instead of \u0646\u0627\u0645. This doesn't just affect nouns and stuff but it extends to verbs and everything, so even if they can speak Persian they might have a false perception of knowing the language better than they really do. For example, they might open up the Shahnameh which is written in relatively \"purer\" Persian, and find it incomprehensible because nobody taught them all of these native Persian words, but native Persian speakers know them.", "created_utc": "1663422961.0", "edited": "False", "id": "iospazj", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_xgbu3y", "parent_id": "t1_iora7qo", "score": "3", "subreddit": "AskMiddleEast", "subreddit_id": "t5_vkfjx"}, {"author": "marmulak", "body": "It's both", "created_utc": "1663420215.0", "edited": "False", "id": "iosjrt8", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_xgbezy", "parent_id": "t3_xgbezy", "score": "0", "subreddit": "AskMiddleEast", "subreddit_id": "t5_vkfjx"}, {"author": "marmulak", "body": "I'm a bit neutral on this matter, so it sort of doesn't matter to me really where artifacts end up.

Within the Persian language you can see a lot of examples of this process of consonants becoming fricatives, depending on time and place. For example the word \"gozashtan\" used to have \"d\" which became \"dh\" and then \"z\", or also the verb \"bovadh\" which doesn't exist anymore in Persian might have had this softening occur. Other examples with P are words like gowspand becoming gusfand, like ispand/isfand. In Mantiq Al-Tayr which was written in Persian in Khorasan, in one place at least the word \"zaban\" comes as \"zufan\". This variation also exists in some common words like \"abzar\" and \"afzar\".\n\nThere is also an ancient example I'm aware of between Old Persian, which is western, and Avestan, which is eastern, the word \"dog\" in OP being \"spaka\" but in Avestan \"spakha\". Or Iranians today saying \"khedmat\" but Tajiks say \"khizmat\".\n\nIt's pretty obvious that none of this stuff happened because of Arabic language. I would say it's a natural phenomenon in Persian and the assumption that Arabic caused it is outdated because at the time people thought this, they did not know much about linguistics. In Iran there are numerous such mistakes and folk etymologies that have been debunked by modern scholarship.\n\nIn modern Persian language the distinction between \"farsi\" and \"parsi\" is in my opinion only slight and irrelevant. You can say whichever you like, but \"farsi\" is more normal today.\n\nAs Cy says, in English you should always say \"Persian\". The potential value of saying \"parsi\" when you are speaking Persian is otherwise debatable because it depends on if the person you are talking to understands what you mean and won't be confused by your use of this word. One potential benefit that seems to exist with calling the language \"parsi\" is Persian unity; it *might* help convince Tajiks and Afghans that their language is \"Persian\" rather than Dari, Tajik, or Farsi as separate entities. But like I said \"parsi\" and \"farsi\" are essentially the same word.\n\n(As for not using the word \"khaleej\", if you have a better suggestion let us know.

Arabic words like \u0645\u0627\u062f\u0647 though not having Persian roots, were probably borrowed from Persian, which constitutes a lot of words in Turkish, but I wouldn't point them all out since they are technically Arabic in origin.

It seems like as much as time has allowed, Turkish and Persian have found overlap with one another.\n\nI feel that violent attempts to separate the two from one another (Persian and Turkish) as in the case of the language reforms you mentioned, amount to a crime against humanity and are truly anti-Turkish.

Over the years, its ability to translate texts has improved quite a lot.\n\nI do not expect the Tajik translation to be as good as the Persian translation, but also the Tajik translations have improved over time as well. Looking at the sample text you gave, what Google seems to have done is produced a Tajik text that is *extremely close* to the Persian text, but some words have been changed.

The Persian text uses the English word \"action\" to refer more to what goes on in the game like how the characters fight, jump, roll, etc. Whereas the word \"amal\" also exists in Persian, but the original author didn't use it because that would just have meant something more general along the lines of, \"how it works\", or maybe how to play. Still, the meaning is close in any case.\n\nAs you know, Google treats them as different languages, but because they are not different languages the translation ends up being eerily similar either way.

Probably also unique to Ferdowi's work, Zahhak isn't portrayed as pure evil, but to some extent he's rather humanized and you could even argue that he's a victim of evil. Him being the evil villain is shown in the Shahnameh as a *personal* story unique to Zahhak and not stemming from the fact that he came from Arabia.

In other words, Zahhak came from a good family but fell from grace.\n\nAnyway there is probably more that could be added to this, but that's the bit I know.

Some people regard him as a literary preservationist who simply painstakingly compiled Iran's myths and legends into a history of sorts, but the reality is a lot more complicated than this. The Shahnameh does contain a small amount of borrowed verses, and Ferdowsi included many stories that he heard passed down orally, but his book is full of original content.

In Iran for example one might say \u062e\u062f\u0627 \u0631\u0627 \u0634\u06a9\u0631 xod\u0101 r\u0101 shokr, whereas in Tajikistan it's very common to say \u0627\u0644\u0647\u06cc \u0634\u06a9\u0631 il\u0101hi shukr, so the concept exists and is used every day, but the form is different from Arabic proper.\n\ninshallah/mashallah are more common overall in languages spoken by Muslims. Coming up with an equivalent saying is not so easy, but I noticed instead of inshallah, Tajiks tend to say \"nasib\".\n\nFor Turkish language, I would not be surprised to find a similar occurrence. From what I can see in Google Translate, Turkish equivalents might be:\n\njazakallah -> te\u015fekk\u00fcrler (and many others)  \nalhamdulillah -> tanr\u0131ya \u015f\u00fck\u00fcr (lol)  \ninshallah -> k\u0131smetse", "created_utc": "1659679851.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ij0rquo", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_wglk21", "parent_id": "t1_ij0n8xi", "score": "9", "subreddit": "turkishlearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2xbsq"}, {"author": "marmulak", "body": "I'm sorry but this one is just too big", "created_utc": "1659679202.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ij0qt1o", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_wg49do", "parent_id": "t3_wg49do", "score": "2", "subreddit": "IranPics", "subreddit_id": "t5_348bl"}, {"author": "marmulak", "body": "based", "created_utc": "1659669306.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ij09z18", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_wg8e6v", "parent_id": "t1_iiz5m2j", "score": "2", "subreddit": "AskCentralAsia", "subreddit_id": "t5_ujz7x"}, {"author": "marmulak", "body": "Historically they are not because the past is done", "created_utc": "1659638442.0", "edited": "False", "id": "iiy8hbj", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_wfqdn1", "parent_id": "t1_iiy7mla", "score": "1", "subreddit": "azerbaijan", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s8kv"}, {"author": "marmulak", "body": "Probably Aliyev himself is on here reading this", "created_utc": "1659627344.0", "edited": "False", "id": "iixf083", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_wfqdn1", "parent_id": "t1_iixebvj", "score": "7", "subreddit": "azerbaijan", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s8kv"}, {"author": "marmulak", "body": "> Contrary to you I don't claim that turkish is rich language\n\nTurkish is definitely rich, there is no denying that.

The equivalent in Esperanto is -igi so for example \"bonigi\" means the same thing as \"fari bona\", or to make good.

I'll give you an example with -l\u0259m\u0259k, the verb \"d\u0259ml\u0259m\u0259k\" which is \"d\u0259m k\u0259rd\u0259n\" in Persian.

The languages are so similar to each other that any attack on one is going to damage the other.

This is claimed a lot on this sub, but I'll give you an example: This is like saying, that the USA is an African country, because Obama was president. It just doesn't work like that. Iran can have kings who are Turks, and it doesn't stop being Iran. Khamenei himself is Azeri, so we have a present day example of this. If you say Iran has been ruled by Turks for thousands of years (technically not true, but ~1000 years yes, although not wholly), one can simply also say that Turks have been Persianized for over a thousand years.\n\nThe claim that 40% of Iran's population speaks Turkish, is simply not true. You'd have to be a little bit stupid or crazy to believe something like that.\n\nYour claim that Persian is an ethnic or regional language in Iran is false. Persian is the lingua franca or inter-ethnic language. Someone from Balochistan, for example, communicates with someone from Kurdistan or Azerbaijan in Persian because it is the national language. Turkish is not the national language or a national language in Iran. Khuzestani Arabs don't learn Turkish so they can talk to Khorasanis, and so on. Persian is not ethnic, but universal, just like how right now you and I are using English to communicate, but we are not Englishmen.\n\n> If you think that Turks are second-tier people in Iran, so they don't deserve to receive education in their mother tongue, give their children Turkish names, or speak Turkish in government institutions, then you have no right to cry about separatism. They are striving to preserve their ethnic identity.\n\nAll Iranians have the right to learn Persian, their national language, receive education in it, and speak Persian in government institutions. Having people in Iran speak any regional language in these contexts is not plausible or desirable. Iran is one nation, not fifty different nations. Everyone has the right to speak their own mother tongue, but your opposition to Persian is a thin guise for opposition to Iran itself.\n\nAs for giving your kids Turkish names, you can already do that in Iran. Also contrary to what you said, there are Turkish language schools and so on. In Iranian public universities, there are even courses taught in Turkish. (Depends on the region.) This is not done officially, but in some regions Turkish speakers take over public institutions and then apply their linguistic chauvinism at the expense of other, innocent Iranians who don't speak Turkish. Sometimes citizens ask for the national language to be used and are rudely ignored by Pan-Turkists.\n\nYour suggestion of instituting Turkish as the language of government in Iran, undermines the equality of citizens before the state.

If you look carefully however, there isn't that big of a difference between the language then and now. Even words with Turkic roots and not Persian roots, are in many cases calques (translations) of Persian words into Turkish, some of them \"newly invented\", which you seem to hate. The thing is, you can't have it both ways. If a language is bad for having loans from Arabic and Persian, then Ottoman Turkish is bad, but if a language is bad for creating new words to \"fix itself\" then modern Turkish is bad. You basically gave two contradicting criteria here.\n\n> How do you know? You don't even speak the language. You are pan Persian Tajik snake that still hasn't lost the ownership of r/Uzbekistan somehow\n\nI have studied both Persian and Turkish. I actually graduated from an official Turkish language institute with honors, so if you want to discuss specific words between Turkish and Persian, we can delve into the similarities or differences together. You seemed to have claimed that Tukish language today lacks: loans from French, English, or Arabic (not true), neologisms (not true), or derivational verbs (not true). Like, for example, if you're referring to how Persian uses the verbs like \u06a9\u0631\u062f\u0646 and \u0634\u062f\u0646 a lot, Turkish does the exact same constructions for the same reasons as Persian does. In many cases they are just translations of the Persian verb into Turkish.\n\nI know Turkish is not better than Persian, because no language is better than another language. They are all equal. Also it's wrong/evil of you to call Persians or Tajiks \"snakes\". Millions of citizens of Uzbekistan are Tajik Persians, and Uzbekistan is as equally Persian as it is Turkic. It doesn't belong specifically to one group or the other, as they are both part of one greater Turanian nation, just like how Azeris and Persians are equal members of one Iranian nation.\n\nAs for r/Uzbekistan, I rescued it from a mod that did not care for the sub and abandoned it. Then I promoted native Uzbeks to moderate that sub, but none of them carried on with it. They all had their accounts deleted or something because they are no longer mods and I did not demod them. I don't know why Uzbeks can't or won't moderate their own sub. I was also the owner of r/Turkiye and donated it to actual Turks once one was promoted and after some time I was satisfied that they were taking good care of the sub.

Herodotus in ancient times mentions this, so it's not modern.

Of course, Turan which we find mentioned in the Shahnameh is contemporary to Ferdowsi's time. The ancient myth of Turan predates Iranians having come into contact with Turks or even knowing what they were, but over time when Turks began to spread into Central Asia, Iranians became aware of their existence, for example in Sassanid texts they are clearly mentioned, and so Turks may have been incorporated into the mythology as it evolved to the time of Ferdowsi, who knew what a Turk was. However, the concept of Turan itself predates this, and the origin of the myth was that Iran and Turan were related tribes from the same Aryan ancestry. They went to war with each other and also intermarried, but the story makes it clear they are cousins and so Turan was not so foreign. In fact, not foreign at all, but familiar.\n\n>Iranians actually despise Tomyris\n\nNo, they don't. In fact it's likely not true that she killed Cyrus. Legendary kings and heroes were often said to have died in battle, even if they had not. It was just important to claim they had the most glorious end.

All anyone talks about on this sub is Uyghur independence, which to be honest is maybe about as realistic as talking about Texan independence or something like that.

That's what natives used to call it before Chinese colonization and modern inventions like \"East Turkestan\".\n\nSo if you're looking for elegant, it is Altishahr, otherwise you will have to refer to individual cities like Urumqi (whose name is not even Uyghur), Kashgar, etc. Or a broad geographical region like the Tarim Basin.", "created_utc": "1658155739.0", "edited": "1658155992.0", "id": "igncrso", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_w1e7ey", "parent_id": "t3_w1e7ey", "score": "2", "subreddit": "Uyghur", "subreddit_id": "t5_2z3ri"}, {"author": "marmulak", "body": "Facebook would probably be a good idea.

I mean, really, they were the two largest centers of population for Tajiks in Central Asia, so it's only natural. Tajikistan, when it separated from Uzbekistan, was kind of pushed off into a corner, as if Tajikistan is a sort of reservation. A lot of Tajiks in Uzbekistan didn't even want to go there.\n\nIn terms of Turkic influence, this is a bit complicated and goes both ways. Persian, as a single standard or literary language, was hugely influential in the Muslim world, when Turkic peoples came to Central Asia and the Middle East and converted to Islam, Persian was the language of civilization, so there was a lot of assimilation that took place. Languages like Uzbek and other forms of Turkish got influenced a lot by Persian, and over a long period of coexistence, Persian has clearly been influenced by Turkic languages in turn. I found that there's a regional grouping, where in Central Asia Uzbek and Tajik are more similar to *each other* and in places like Iran, Anatolia, and the Caucuses, Farsi, Turkish, and Azeri are also more similar to one another. Farsi in Iran has been affected apparently by Azeri speakers also speaking Farsi, like Tajik appears to also have gotten influenced by people who spoke Uzbek. (Fun fact: Farsi and Azerbaijani have the same phonology, which means you can take the Azerbaijani alphabet and use it to write any word Farsi speakers in Iran say. Likewise, the Uzbek alphabet can be used, without modification, to spell any Tajik word. The sounds/pronunciations are the same.)\n\nIn spite of the differences, Tajik and Farsi as dialects of Persian are more similar to each other than, say, Turkish and Uzbek languages, which have grown further apart.\n\nAs far as me noticing Bukharan is a little closer to Iranian Persian than Tajikistan Persian is, the explanation may simply be geographic since they are physically closer to each other. Media consumption probably will play a more significant role as time goes by. For some specific things I can only guess, but \"fardo\" for \"tomorrow\" is not going to be unique to any particular dialect because that word is well attested in classical Persian writings, which means it's universally recognized.\n\nIn a way it's good that standard Tajik came from Bukhara. Bukhara was formally one of the main centers of education and literature in the Persian language. Historically over time, the centers of Persian language have shifted around here and there. Bukhara, during the Samanid era (hugely influential era), was basically the capital of Iran at the time.\n\nBecause Persian is primarily a literary language, perhaps even more than it is a spoken language, when the USSR standardized Tajik instead of formalizing some region's spoken dialect, they were very careful to adhere to literary standards. Tajik writing, therefore, was kept literally the same as written Persian *except* the alphaet was change. Just switched to Cyrillic, but the words are nonetheless the same words and pronounced the same as they were in previous written documents. This makes Tajik very easy for educated Persian speakers, actually, because it precisely matches the classical language.", "created_utc": "1657971417.0", "edited": "1657971740.0", "id": "igdtf0o", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_vv6czu", "parent_id": "t1_igdo1fl", "score": "5", "subreddit": "AskCentralAsia", "subreddit_id": "t5_ujz7x"}, {"author": "marmulak", "body": "Yes your thinking is pretty accurate. Tajikistan and Iran have been separate societies for a long time, like several centuries at least, but the fact that they speak Persian goes way back over 1000 years. In modern times Persian has also evolved somewhat due to the influence of the USSR, and in Iran certain changes also took places. For example, a word like \"furudgoh\" for \"airport\" is a modern invention and afaik originated from Iran, but it was formally adopted in Tajik Persian a long time ago, so nobody would think or notice it's from Iran per se.\n\nWhat you're talking about, though, is a lot more recent of a phenomenon, like how did the country interact in the last fifty years, or perhaps since the Iranian revolution. Tajikistan only left the USSR in 1991 and the civil war kept them busy into the early 2000's, so there hasn't been a whole lot of time for Tajiks to absorb everything they can from Iranian media, but yes lots of people in Tajikistan today and for the past twenty or thirty years have been watching Iranian TV, listening to Iranian music, and watching Iranian movies. This is more popular than writing (the society is not very literate), and easier to import and slip by censors than books, so you usually don't find people reading books from Iran.\n\nThe one-way relationship between the two dialects makes it so when Iranians talk Tajiks understand them better usually than how well Iranians can understand Tajiks, depending on the speaker though. It varies a lot because many Tajiks don't know or accept a standard form for their language, whereas Iranians do, so to talk with Iranians you're learning one dialect, but to talk with Tajiks you're learning 100 dialects. In the face of that weak standardization here, a lot of people just speak Russian to get their point across, which means Iranians' comprehension then will drop to 0, whereas if the person stuck with Tajik their comprehension, with flaws, would still be like 80-90%.\n\nThis disparity happens with a lot of languages in the world, like Turkish media is very popular in countries like Azerbaijan, for example, to the point where a large number of Azerbaijanis have fully learned or adapted to the language used by people in Istanbul or Ankara, but people from there might not understand Azerbaijanis *as well* because they didn't watch Azerbaijani TV for thousands of hours. Or like, Ukrainian speakers usually know Russian better, than Russians know Ukrainian.

This happens with every language, like in Russia some villagers speak some fucked up dialect of Russian other people don't understand, or like English in some parts of the UK. However, Persian is like Russian and English; it has a standard form that you read and write, and also you speak the standard language in common with everyone else when they don't understand your dialect (if you speak one). All educated and literate people in society know the standard form well, but the fact that Tajikistan was colonized by Russia means that much of Tajikistan's population is kept uneducated and illiterate. A lot of people never learn that part of the language.\n\nBy definition though, if something stops being Persian, it stops being Tajik as well.

If this is just his fledgling attempt to explore and learn about the Muslim world then I hope he keeps going and learns more.\n\nHis advice about it being imperative for Muslims to stop fighting among themselves is extremely true and important. (Even a blind squirrel finds a nut on occasion.) It's not only Shia/Sunni sectarianism. That's a common rookie mistake when westerners get interested in Islam they think sectarianism explains everything Muslims do. In fact, we have a lot of nonsense dividing us, like nationalism, for example.\n\nHe is wrong if he thinks we have issues with Christianity and Judaism. I guess here he's a little drunk on idealism, thinking that the main problem is discordance between the Abrahamic brotherly faiths and that bringing religious Jews, Christians, and Muslims together will solve everybody's problems. That's not even remotely true, but it's a popular cliche you might encounter in America. In the Middle East we have political problems more than we have religious problems. Religious Muslims, Jews, and Christians are actually quite often already cool with each other, though this is not meant to downplay the obvious conflicts like Israel vs. the World. That's not because of religion, though; there religion is just serving as an identity or symbol.

Someone's got to tell him we all heard about jihaad al-nafs before. Imam Ali (AS) has said that our greatest enemy is our own ignorance.\n\nThat Muslims should refine their character and be shining examples to others, is also a cornerstone of our prophetic and religious tradition and belief. It is sad that not many Muslims live up to this anymore, to the extent that someone like Dr. Peterson has come to remind us to do this.\n\nBut anyway, kudos to him for loving and respecting Muslims, and including us as part of a bigger interfaith family and among the traditionalists. I did a lot of interfaith work in the past in my youth, and his statement shows that he gets the fundamental premise and he's not an Islamophobe.\n\nBy the way, some of the things he says are reminiscent of the words of Khomeini.

Of the world's population of 8 billion people, it's said that over a billion people \"speak English\", but I think that includes everybody regardless of their level. I'm sure they're counting people who barely speak it, or speak it poorly. The fact is, while something like a sixth of the global population is truly a large number, that still means over 80% of people on Earth don't know English. That's a huge majority.\n\nSo going back to using your target language. I studied Persian in the US and spent most of my time around people who spoke primarily English. Later, I moved to a country where Persian is spoken. When you go to that country where the language is spoken, you will of course meet people there who can speak English, and those people will try to latch onto you. You could end up in a bubble pretty easily. To many people, you're just their opportunity to speak English.\n\nSo, you know what I did? I was really rude to people. (lol.) I had this iron will and determination to only speak Persian, and basically anyone I met over here I insisted, absolutely, that we only speak Persian. They wouldn't get a word of English out of me. I used to not respond when people spoke English to me and ignore them. A lot of the times they probably came to the conclusion that I didn't know English. Sometimes I'd tell people off for not speaking Persian, although most of the time not responding to any other language was enough.\n\nWhen you do this, you're not going to make friends with people who speak English, or the Ameriboos or UK-boos or whatever you want to call them. They're probably going to hate you. You can hate them back. You WILL make friends with people who love and appreciate their own language and culture. Some of them will be nationalists and whatnot, but that's OK. I always found it easier to respect people who respected themselves more than those people who put English first. And don't get me wrong; some of them will know English too, but they will OK with setting it aside for you. In other words, their obsession with English will not be strong enough to interfere with your friendship, or at least your obsession with *their* language has to overpower their obsession with yours. :P\n\nIf you really stick to your target language, you'll also meet that 80% I talked about earlier. People who simply can't speak English, or if they can it's extremely difficult for them. They will appreciate you so much, and I feel quite blessed to have conversed with such people in my life. They have a LOT to say. People really open up to you when they realize they can talk to you. And yes, it is interesting for them to talk to foreigners, but the ones who don't speak English often have their own insights and views to share with you. Particularly older people.

We came from Tajikistan, so we already knew Tajik Persian and that helped us a lot too, but if you're from Iran you can still communicate, but you have to try a little harder. I noticed people in Bukhara said some things in common with Iranian Persian that I usually didn't hear in Tajikistan, like \"tomorrow\" being \"fardo\" instead of \"pagoh\". I wondered if this was just a dialect difference of Bukhara, because it's closer to Iran, or they just dealt with a lot of Iranian tourists or watch Iranian TV or something.\n\nIn Tashkent: Lots of people don't speak Persian. Obviously the majority of the population is Uzbek. However, Tajiks were found everywhere too, since they're the 2nd ethnic group. We also met ethnic Uzbeks who spoke Iranian Persian, but this was a rarity. (We just happened to run into a group of students in Uzbekistan who studied Persian at uni. Funny thing was, they denied that they knew Tajik, lol.)\n\nWhen you can't use Persian, try using Uzbek. Learn some useful phrases before you go. That's what I did, and it was incredibly helpful. Simple questions like, \"Where is...?\", \"We're going to...\", \"How much is it?\", \"Just looking.\" I was able to get through any situation with like three or four phrases and also knowing how to count. When you buy something and they tell you how much it is, then it's helpful to understand. They can tell you the amount in Uzbek or Russian. If you know any Turkish or Azeri counting, Uzbek numbers are the same.\n\nIn Samarkand: Everyone we met knew at least a little Persian. And by little, I mean potentially very little. They mixed it heavily with Uzbek, but even with the language barrier we could still get along. Persian was all we needed for taxis, at restaurants, etc. The city's population is mixed like Tashkent, but the Tajiks are natives. The first guy we ran into once we got there was a nice Tajik man who helped us with everything; which hotel to go to, where to exchange money, etc. We hired him and his friend to take us to see the grave of Bukhari.\n\nIn Bukhara: Literally everyone speaks Persian. There's some Uzbeks there but they are clearly a minority, whereas on the street you hear everyone speaking Persian in public.\n\nIn the west of the country we went to Khiva, Nukus, and Urgench. We didn't meet any Persian speakers there. However, a lot of people from that part of Uzbekistan identify as Khwarazmi, which is an Iranian ethnic group, but they can only speak Uzbek or Russian. I got the impression that they feel their Khwarazmi identity sets them apart from the rest of Uzbekistan.\n\ntl;dr Persian can work like 80% of the time but sometimes you need a backup.

Tajiks if they could all read Persian, would have access to a world of science and literature. Things *already written* in their own language.\n\nA couple weeks ago I was trying to explain how this works to my students, and I was saying, suppose you want to read Harry Potter. Can you find it in Tajik? Probably not. Children in Tajikistan are forced to read this book in Russian or English *if they can*, and the vast majority cannot. That means the majority of Tajik children simply are forced to miss out.
