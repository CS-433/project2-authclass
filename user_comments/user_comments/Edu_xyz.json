But as I have listened more and more, my comprehension has been improving. Now I started to learn japanese and the problem is the same, I can pick up only a few words. I think this is normal. Your problem seems lack of listening practice. You watch netflix with english subtitles? If yes, that doesn't help much, because you would only pay attention to the subtitles rather than that portuguese subtitles would be better. The same for that woman's channel pay attention only to the portuguese subtitles if you don't understand what she's saying.\n\nMaybe the problem can be that you don't understand when people cut off some syllables while speaking. For example, I had learned the phrase \"what did you do yesterday?\" at school but in real life people say more like \"whajado yesterday?\".\n\nHave you already tried to study by reading texts with while listening the audio of the same text? I haven't done much of that because I didn't think it was needed but some people say that it is helpful.\n\nThat thing of thinking in potuguese I think it isn't really accurate. It's more like expressing your thoughts in portuguese as if the words in portuguese are synonyms to the english words. Like that red fruit good to make pies. That can be called either ma\u00e7\u00e3 or apple. I don't know if this helps lol.\n\n> I take vocabulary tests and they say that I know 6700 words.   But tests are different than actually knowing how to use the words. \n\nSome teachers on youtube say that is better to learn set phrases than words one by one, because you would learn by context and it would be easier to remember the words. I have used the app Anki for a while with phrases instead of words but I can't say if it helped because I couldn't make it as a habit. My inability to study regularly hinders me a lot btw. \n\nI think that americans that learned portuguese can help you more, because they know the difficulties of learning it as an american. Though each person learns differently, so try different ways of studying, look for something that works for you. Maybe slow down the velocity of youtube videos or even watching shows for kids. \n\nI don't know what more I can say.

It's hard for me with english too because we don't have some english tenses like I haven't eat yet, in these cases we just use present or simple past depending the context, so I still don't know perfecly we should I use this tense.\n\nNot every expression of other language you can translate. For exemple:\n\nIn portuguese there is an idiom \"chutar o balde\" that means something like to throw everything up in the air or to lost the temper. And the literal translation would be \"kick the bucket\" that means to die.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>I go to Brasil and can\u2019t even order food or converse yet. Part of that is not being able to understand what people are saying.\n\nYou need to start listening something in Portuguese, start with something easy and increase the level as you improve your skill. Reading something is good too because you increase your vocab and when you listen a word, you would be able to identify the word and understand easily.\n\nYou can ask your teacher to help you with useful sentences that you can use to order food or other specific contexts.\n\nA guy that teaches english for brazilians make a video telling how he have learned portuguese. [Check it out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0cHhUrOyek).\n\nThere is also a youtube channel I recommend of a portuguese teacher that speaks very clear and slowly. [Take a look](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU7ze62PseQ) and see if you like.\n\nYou have said that you have been studying portuguese for 6 years. I don't know are you studying but that's too much time. I think in a year or less it is possible to start understanding what the people are saying (obviously, not complex sentences).\n\nIn Brazil we also have this problem. We study english for more than 10 years at school and at the end of it, almost nobody can understand english.\n\nI have been able to read and listen when I started to watch youtube channels and movies, listening to music and podcasts, playing videogames, reading websites, all in english.
