The adulteries of the gods and their amours, and especially those of the one whom they call Zeus, chief of all and most high, things of which one cannot speak, even in connection with brutes, without blushing, we shall leave to the stage. I have the same words for the historians, and especially when they make up stories for the amusement of their hearers. And certainly we shall not follow the example of the rhetoricians in the art of lying. For neither in the courts of justice nor in other business affairs will falsehood be of any help to us Christians, who, having chosen the straight and true path of life, are forbidden by the gospel to go to law. But on the other hand we shall receive gladly those passages in which they praise virtue or condemn vice. For just as bees know how to extract honey from flowers, which to men are agreeable only for their fragrance and color, even so here also those who look for something more than pleasure and enjoyment in such writers may derive profit for their souls. Now, then, altogether after the manner of bees must we use these writings, for the bees do not visit all the flowers without discrimination, nor indeed do they seek to carry away entire those upon which they light, but rather, having taken so much as is adapted to their needs, they let the rest go. So we, if wise, shall take from heathen books whatever befits us and is allied to the truth, and shall pass over the rest. And just as in culling roses we avoid the thorns, from such writings as these we will gather everything useful, and guard against the noxious.

The salute has been used since Nikola \u0160ubi\u0107 Zrinski in 1566 \"Za dom, sad u boj\". Croatian ban Josip Jela\u010di\u0107 says \"Za dom\", and then soldiers would reply \"spremni umrijeti (cro. ready to die)\". In 1941-1945, Ante Paveli\u0107 transformed it into the greeting \"Za dom - spremni\" where he adopted it as the official greeting of the Usta\u0161e party. In the war for Croatian independence, many veterans used this salute \"za dom spremni\", and HOS (1991-1993) adopted the same salute on its coat of arms, as well as in its oaths. According to the decisions of the Supreme Military Court of Croatia from 1994, as well as the decisions of the Croatian Parliament in 2004, the HOS is a legitimate army that defended Croatia. The claim that \"za dom spremni\" Ustasha salute are lies which is comes from Serbs and communists (I would dare to say from the devil himself). These were people who have always hated the Croatian people: the Serbs in the state of SHS and the Kingdom of Yugoslavia systematically oppressed all non-Serb peoples (including the Croats), because they implemented their Great Serbian politic. During and after the second world war, the communists hated the Croats, because they wanted communist Yugoslavia; during the 2nd World War they committed cruel crimes in which they killed many Croats who were not Usta\u0161e, a great example of this is Bleiburg and Kri\u017eni put (cro. \"Crossroads\"). During the communist Yugoslavia, the communists (mostly Serbs) legally persecuted all those who declared their national identity or highlighted their national symbols. Although the checkerboard was the official symbol of SR Croatia, the Yugoslav authorities persistently persecuted those Croats who displayed the Croatian coat of arms (the checkerboard), calling it the \"Ustasha symbol\". In general, everything that was connected to Croatia was considered and demonized as Usta\u0161a. After the independence of Croatia, the Serbs declared war on Croatia, wanting to establish Greater Serbia on it, and Serbian politicians and the media spread propaganda that modern Croatia is the successor of the NDH (Independent State of Croatia).

This is one of the reason why is Croatian grammar much easier than Serbian.\n\nCroatian language use \"ije/je\", but Serbain use \"e (ekavica)\", for example word \"milk\":\n\nMlijeko (Croatian)\n\nMleko (Serbian)\n\nLet's understand each other, Zagorian dialect (Croatia) also use \"e (ekavica)\" in words, but this is not automaticly Serbian language, because Serbian sometimes has different words, for example:\n\nSused (Zagorian dialect), Susjed (\u0160tokavian dialect - officialy Croatian dialect)\n\nKom\u0161ija (Serbian)", "created_utc": "1652382691.0", "edited": "1652382895.0", "id": "i8csuk5", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_unmtjb", "parent_id": "t3_unmtjb", "score": "1", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "Negative_Mushroom_69", "body": "Montenegrian and Serbian are not the same languages.

Also, God sent prophets whenever the people of Israel lost/distanced themselves from God, apart from the call to conversion, God promised a new and eternal covenant with humanity - he will send the messiah (Jesus) into the world. Jesus was born through Mary, grew up like all people, was equal to us in everything except sin. By his mission, Jesus revealed the truth about Heavenly Father, as well as the way to Him. In order for mankind to be reconciled to God, Jesus offered Himself as a sacrifice, as a reward for all sins from the first ever to the last people ever to be. After death, the righteous who died before Christ went to heaven with Christ, while the unrighteous who sinned gravely (e.g., cursing God's name, committing fornication, etc.) were not saved, because during Their lives, they had no sacrifice a burnt offering, to compensate for the damage they had done by sin. Since Christ died for other generations, there is hope for you to believe in a God who loves you and who, like all people, wants to save you from eternal death (hell). Of course, since God, like every human being, has left you free, you have a choice whether to accept that gift of salvation through baptism, repentance for your own sins (God can forgive you all, even the most serious sins, thanks to Jesus Christ) and love of God and neighbor or to reject it and continue to disbelieve and sin. God is not evil, but many people do not want to receive this gift of salvation, which is offered as long as we live", "created_utc": "1641738841.0", "edited": "1641739097.0", "id": "hrx19hn", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_rzr3s4", "parent_id": "t3_rzr3s4", "score": "-1", "subreddit": "Christianity", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh6c"}, {"author": "Negative_Mushroom_69", "body": "People need to know the importance of the sacrament of baptism", "created_utc": "1641724484.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hrwe321", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_rzo4pm", "parent_id": "t1_hrwdjiu", "score": "-2", "subreddit": "Christianity", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh6c"}, {"author": "Negative_Mushroom_69", "body": "Atheists, like other human being, cannot be saved by their good deeds, because of our fallen human nature.
