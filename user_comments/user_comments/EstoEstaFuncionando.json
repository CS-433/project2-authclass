English is entirely different to Old Germanic; French is nothing more than corroded Latin. Language\u2014any language\u2014is not and never has been \"degrading,\" or \"being corrupted.\" Barring some fundamental change in our brains, the premise of that statement does not even make sense.\n\nAnd without fail, every time, I get a \"huh, interesting,\" and then five minutes later the person says \"ain't ain't a word\" or some other nonsense.\n\nIt just doesn't get through to people\u2014sometimes even quite educated ones.

Kind of like any culture, I can't encapsulate it all in a reddit comment, but I can rattle off some random things, just be aware that it's by no means comprehensive.\n\n**Food.** Like the other commenter said, lots of people think American food is nothing more than fried stuff and fast food, but America has a *ton* of culinary diversity, both regionally and ethnically. I grew up in the south, and southern food (along with soul food, which is closely related) is a working-class treasure. Italian-American food is a cuisine unto itself, with a rich tradition, and not just the corruption of \"real\" Italian food that many native-born Italians would have you think. Ditto Cajun, Southwest, and even Chinese-American cuisine.\n\nI also have to say, while I'm obviously biased, American desserts are, on average, the best I've had. Lots of folks from overseas complain about American food being too sweet, which I totally get (even supermarket bread is sweet here), but when it comes to cakes, pies, pastries, and the like, I'd prefer just go all out rather than pretending it's healthy. Nothing will ever beat classics like apple or pumpkin pies or NY-style cheesecake for me. I also find many foreigners attitudes about this rather disheartening. If someone dismissed Sichuan food as \"too spicy\" or Thai food as \"too sour\" or West African food as \"too bitter,\" you would think they were close-minded. But saying American desserts are disgusting for being \"too sweet\" is somehow acceptable.\n\n**American social norms.** This is the thing that I think is most often lost on people that are very familiar with American pop culture but not America itself, but America, like any country, has it's own unique rules around interacting with people and what is and isn't socially acceptable. I find a lot of folks, Europeans in particular, are surprised by how friendly Americans are. It's different depending on the region/state, but in much of America it's totally acceptable to start a conversation with a stranger on the street, something that, say, an English person would never do.  Likewise, it is rude *not* to smile when meeting or greeting someone in America, whereas in many countries that expression is reserved for when you're downright joyful about something. I'm sad to see that Europeans often dismiss this as \"fake\" though.\n\n**Individualism**. This one is a double-edged sword, as American individualism can often lead to a lack of social cohesion, or people not caring about something that doesn't directly affect them (see: COVID-19 pandemic). But many of its other byproducts I'm very grateful for. Freethinking and even rebelliousness are very much enshrined in the American collective conscious, and there's a strong sense that no one else can tell you how to live your life.\n\n**The diversity and pluralism**. I imagine this is pretty well known about America, but it's one of the things I love the most. I grew up kind of in the middle of nowhere, and even then I was a 20-minute drive from one of the biggest Hmong populations outside of Asia. A half-dozen languages were spoken at my local high school. Not long ago I was at a house party in rural NC and stumbled across two people speaking Arabic to each other. Of course this is increasingly true of many big urban centers in the world, but it's been common even in rural America for a long time.\n\n**The flexibility of identity**. This kind of goes with the point above, but most Americans see no problem with being both \"Mexican\" and \"American\" and \"Mexican-American\" all at the same time. Many Americans will say, \"I'm Irish,\" even if no one in their family has stepped foot in Ireland for two generations. This sometimes confuses or angers foreigners, because they think Americans are claiming nationalities that they don't belong to, but this is a bit of a misunderstanding. Americans tend to both hold on to their heritage and view it as nonconflicting with their overall identity as an American. In America, saying \"I'm Irish,\" or \"I'm German,\" or \"I'm Korean\" is not much different from saying, \"I'm Jewish.\"\n\nAlso, you don't have to be born here to be considered an American, and I don't just mean in the legal sense. I've met plenty of people who moved here well into their adulthood, retain strong accents, and when you ask where they're from or what they identify as, they say, \"American.\" They consider themselves American, and other Americans do too. This would never be the case in, say, Japan, regardless of what your passport says.\n\n**Roadtrip culture**. I don't know why this just popped into my head, and it's pretty minor and whimsical in comparison with the above, but I feel like America has a roadtrip culture that is somewhat unique.

For example, in phonics, the a in 'tack' was called a 'short a' and the a in 'take' was called a 'long a.' This is linguistically incorrect, as English does not distinguish vowel length, and it would be more accurate to say that 'take' has a different vowel sound entirely, and a diphthong at that. Likewise, in grammar class, I remember an absolutely terrible explanation of subject-verb agreement: \"A singular subject takes a plural verb.\"\n\n13-year-old me saw that and thought, \"????\"\n\nWhat they were getting at was this: in English, verbs in the present tense conjugate to agree with the number of their nouns (in the third person, at least).

So for example, you say \"they eat\" but \"he eat**s**.\" But rather than just explaining the (very simple) conjugation rule, they left me with that opposites-day nonsense above, which confused me for years.

There is no curiosity about the peculiarities or customs of where I come from, because they think they understand all of those already. Often they do not.

Unspoken classical languages used to be the norm in much of the world\u2014Latin and Greek in Europe, Classical Chinese in China, Sanskrit in much of South Asia, etc. Some exceptions remain, but writing in the vernacular is becoming more and more common everywhere.\n\n>Who do you THINK gave the world's languages their writing system?\n\nThat depends on the system. Some languages invent their own, most borrow. The one we're using right now was borrowed by the English from Latin, which was borrowed and modified by the Romans from the Greeks, which was borrowed and modified from the Phoenician script (gasp! non-Europeans), which is most likely traceable back to Egyptian hieroglyphics by way of the Proto-Canaanite script.\n\nIn any case, there are plenty of scripts that are not European.\n\n>Why do you think languages that aren't even related to Europe have Latin script?\n\nBecause colonialism is a bitch.\n\n>Why are Filipino languages written in Latin instead of Baybayin?\n\nOh, they had their own writing system before the Spanish came along?

I never said that languages have to have a written form to be real languages, what a ridiculous statement.

Literacy has absolutely nothing to do with forcibly erasing a language. Ironically, one of the best things that could be done to *preserve* a language is to give it a written form, particularly in the pre-modern era before recording.\n\nWhat I said was that literacy is important in virtually any language *that anyone is here is likely to learn.* This spans the gauntlet from French to Georgian to Uzbek to Kannada to Malay.\n\nOf *course* there are plenty of languages that are rarely, if ever, written. Most languages on earth are unwritten. That was never my argument. If you had cared to actually read any of my comments and take them at face value instead of arguing against a bunch of stuff that I *never said,* then you would realize that.\n\nThe vast, vast majority of people learning a foreign language will be learning one of, generously, the 200-300 most spoken. The vast majority of that vast majority will be learning one of the top few dozen\u2014French, Chinese, Arabic, and the like. In most of those, being literate in the language is critical. There are exceptions, or course\u2014but not that many, and they are growing fewer every year. Literacy is getting more important all the time, and more and more languages are trending towards writing close to the vernacular. Unspoken literary languages are all but unheard of in today\u2019s world.

Absolutely not. I wish we could all learn Hmong and Blackfoot and Fenzhounese. I wish we could do something to stop the tide of language death and encourage more linguistic diversity, but I\u2019m just talking about pragmatics here.\n\nAnd the pragmatics are that literacy, for languages you are likely to actually learn, is almost always hugely important.\n\nSuggesting that is not Eurocentric. Civilizationally-centric? Sure. Industrialized-nation centric? Absolutely. Eurocentric? Christ, no. Give me a break. It has nothing to do with *Europe*, and besides there are *plenty* of languages in Europe that are rarely written (incidentally, rarely learned). Calling it Eurocentric is obscenely dismissive of the other written traditions around the world.

The whole fucking Middle East, India, China, Asia, or North Africa? Any of those places?

However, not everyone is a language-learning expert or has spent much time thinking or reading about adult language acquisition. Like it or not, this hopeless attitude about language learning is **very** common among the general public, especially in mostly monolingual countries like the US and other Anglophone states. This is a language learning subreddit. Realistically, this would be one of the first stops for someone with questions/concerns about *language learning*. Our role should be to correct OP and provide him with some guidance, not downvote him into oblivion for the sole reason of being ignorant of our collective area of expertise.\n\n**Now, OP**: what the others are saying is true. Your situation is far from hopeless. Learning a language is a significant undertaking, but one that quite literally any person (assuming no intellectual disabilities, etc) can do. In fact, *most* do\u2014the majority of the world's population is multilingual, and a massive fraction of that is people that have learned their 2nd or 3rd languages past puberty.\n\nYou can **absolutely** learn a language as an adult, and you don't need to move to the country. I speak Spanish and have never even *visited* a Spanish speaking country. Tons of people here speak more exotic languages like Chinese or Arabic or even Vietnamese, without ever having lived in the country. The internet is awesome and you can access media and language partners from anywhere quite easily.\n\nDoes being in the country *help?* Totally. But it's not necessary, and you *don't* automatically learn a language just by moving to the country. It's a lot of work either way.\n\nDuolingo and Rosetta Stone are not going to make you fluent, that's true, but that's because they're not actually that great. Both bank on marketing campaigns that have turned them into the first thing that pops into the general public's head when they think \"language learning,\" but most people here agree that they're overrated (RS in particular is not worth spending a dime on, Duolingo is at least free), and certainly won't lead you to fluency.\n\nIf a non-native, non-Vietnamese person can learn Vietnamese (and I know of many who have), you absolutely can do. Don't get too hung up on not knowing how to read or write yet\u2014from my understanding, the Vietnamese alphabet is phonetic (meaning things are spelled exactly how they are written) and much, much easier than English. Learning a new alphabet is often something you can do in a weekend.\n\nAre you ever going to speak like a native? Well, that depends. Learning to native-like ability is totally doable, but a ton of work for anyone. You said you spoke Vietnamese as a kid and made it sound like you still retain some basic ability. That alone gives you a huge head start (that knowledge is still in there, though you may not realize it). Even if you never speak Vietnamese quite as well as you do English, have an accent, etc, you can still learn it to a high conversational level and maintain that for the rest of your life.\n\nOverall, you need to relax and take a deep breath. You're not inadequate for not speaking Vietnamese, and you can still learn it if you want to. It's not as impossible as you think. Furthermore, you don't need to \"choose\" between one of two cultures\u2014I have been around immigrant communities a large chunk of my life, and I know *plenty* of people who straddle two cultures.\n\nGood luck!

Have none of you ever sat in a math class, and learned about abstract concepts that have no connection to anything you've ever heard of before? Do you learn foreign languages and get mad that they have different word orders than English, or that you have to express things in a different way? Do you go to the movies and walk out when there's a plot twist?\n\nCS isn't about for-loops and function calls. The earliest languages didn't even have those anyway. It's about computation, about problems, about *ideas*. Anything that teaches you \u2014 forces you \u2014 to think about computation in a different way has the potential to teach you a different way of solving problems, and that alone makes it worthwhile. Maybe you will spend significant time with Lisp and still decide that its particular set of tradeoffs is not for you, and that's of course perfectly fine.

If an *industry of ideas* is getting close-minded, that's not a good sign.\n\nSo yeah, go learn Lisp. Go learn Forth and Haskell and Prolog and Erlang and Smalltalk and fucking Brainfuck while you're at it, too. Write a compression algorithm in Assembly just to learn how.

Learn how manual memory management works even if you're never going to be paid to write a line of C++ in your entire professional life. Learn about SQL and NoSQL and Datalog. Learn about different ways of doing polymorphism and different models for concurrency.\n\nAnd yeah, maybe you'll decide to build everything in Java anyway. There are very good, responsible-grown-up reasons for doing just that. But that's not the point. The point is that in the process of learning all those things, you'll learn how to *think.* Not about *programming* problems, but about *problems*. You'll gain a flexibility of thought that will serve you better than any number of trendy frameworks piled up in the skills section of your resume. Encountering something new and unfamiliar ought to *excite* you, not irk you, because that means there is something new to learn \u2014 a new source of ideas you haven't yet mined, fresh perspectives you haven't seen before.\n\nPlease, please learn new things.

To a Spanish speaker this would sound closer to \"aportunidades.\" The actual sound of the Spanish 'o' is more like the 'o' in \"open\" or \"only.\"\n\nThis kind of thing sometimes does not seem important to a native English speaker, because English is pretty loosey-goosey with vowels. Different dialects can pronounce vowels differently, and L2 speakers often butcher English vowels completely, and it generally does not impede understanding. Also, certain vowels feel unnatural to an English speaker depending on their position in a word. Unstressed vowels often turn into a schwa.\n\nNot the case in Spanish. There are exactly five vowels, all of which are pronounced exactly the same every time, and can occur in pretty much any position in a word.

Languages are interesting in their own right, and worth learning for the world of culture and personal relationships that they open up to you, but the idea that any one language has some inexpressible level of nuance embedded in every tiny phrase and utterance, more so than any other language, is just...wrong. Translatability as a universal is pretty central to the entire field of linguistics. Sure, for X language, there will be nuances of meaning that exist in that language, but not in Y language. The reverse will also be true. And this is true for literally any pair of languages in the world, including English and any other.\n\nHe also seems bizarrely fixated on languages with complex inflectional morphology? Which is fine, those languages are interesting, but they're not actually more complicated than analytical languages like English or Chinese. There is broad agreement among linguists that all natural languages are of roughly equal complexity. In the case of analytical languages, often this complexity is hiding in word order.\n\nTake the sentence, \"She told him that she loved him,\" and then try inserting the word \"only\" before any word in that sentence. Each time will yield a perfectly grammatical result with a subtly (sometimes drastically) different meaning. Or consider the complexity of [adjective order](https://imgur.com/gallery/2Cgrb) in English. How about explaining the meaning of the tense, \"I will have been doing\" to a speaker of a language without a rich tense-aspect system. \"You see, this form refers to a time in the future, when in the past -- your future's past, which could be the present or the past, from the perspective of this moment right now! -- you did some action, but that action will still be going on as of the aforementioned time in the future.\" It's honestly not a super intuitive idea, and it's absolutely wild not only that English (along with many other languages) even *makes* such a fine-grained distinction, but that we all pick it up as kids without even thinking about it too hard.\n\nPeople like to talk about the difficulty of \"complex\" conjugations and case systems, but the more complicated the morphology of a language, the more regular its rules tend to become. I learned some Turkish over the summer, and while the grammar is complex for an English speaker, it's also extremely regular. Japanese likewise has complex but extremely regular morphology. Compare this with the hundreds of strong verbs in English which, for no reason other than history and linguistic inertia, conjugate differently than literally every other verb in English. Likewise, if you fuck up word order in English, you've either spouted gibberish, made yourself sound like a child, or even said something entirely different from what you intended. I've heard a similar thing from many learners of Chinese -- at first they think, \"ah, this is easy, there's practically no grammar!\" But as they get more advanced they begin to realize there are tons of preset patterns they have to learn, and if you mess up even a little part of it you'll have botched the whole phrase.\n\nI think OP has some major misconceptions about the nature of language. At the end of the day, we're all just humans, and we're all just speaking about more or less the same types of things, and no one language is naturally more expressive or complex than any other.

No way around it. When I started with Spanish I would literally have to look up every single word in most sentences. If I were you, I wouldn't worry about \"breaking immersion\" -- at the early stage you're at, you're so far from reading just for enjoyment that it can't really be considered immersion. Think of it less as *reading* a text and more as *studying* it. And don't bite off more than you can chew. You may be completely mentally exhausted after reading/translating (I actually recommend translation as a good learning tool at early stages, btw) just a couple of paragraphs. This is totally fine. Just keep at it every day. Reread what you've read a day or two later. You will find you've forgotten some of the meanings/grammar, which is nothing to worry about; look them up again if you need to. You can slap them into an SRS if that's your thing. Most importantly, just keep chipping away.\n\n(2) There **are** things you can do to make reading easier on yourself. Even native children's books can be really hard at a beginner's level -- any child old enough to read or be read to already has a lexicon and grammar knowledge far bigger than an early-stage adult learner. Graded readers can be useful here. They may not be native material, but they are written in a restricted style that deliberately repeats vocab and grammar points over and over so that they stick. Bilingual parallel texts and [reading on a screen](https://ios.gadgethacks.com/how-to/add-foreign-language-dictionaries-your-iphone-look-up-definitions-faster-0167135/#:~:text=The%20fastest%20way%20to%20add,your%20iPhone's%20built%2Din%20dictionary) can also help ease the pain of looking things up (the latter mostly for vocab, but the former can also help with grammar).\n\nAnother surprisingly good reading resource *specifically* for native English speakers who are learning a Romance language is...Wikipedia. Seriously. Since most \"sophisticated\" vocabulary in English comes from either French or Latin, reading something slightly technical can actually be *easier* as a beginner than everyday language. Often you'll know or be able to guess the majority of words in a Wikipedia article's summary, which can make it good for learning grammar and sentence structure without getting overwhelmed by unfamiliar vocab. I did this a lot when starting with Spanish, together with kids' stories and a reader or two.\n\n--\n\nAs I stated above, not saying that any of this is gospel. It's just what worked for me in Spanish and has so far been working (with some modifications) in Japanese. Some (most?) people would probably find this method to be unspeakably tedious.

If you're intermediate to advanced and can understand the general meaning of the text, then don't bother with memorizing every little word you come across. In fact, don't worry about memorizing at all -- just look up the words you need to as you're reading. A good rule of thumb is that if you see something 3 times, or if it's critical to the meaning of the text, it's probably worth looking up.\n\nIt can be frustrating to read a text and feel like there's a significant number of words you couldn't actually write down the definition of, but the reality is you probably spent years doing this in your L1 and never thought too hard about it. Lots of more obscure vocab can be understood through context (though not necessarily the first time you see it). And no matter what the language, your passive vocabulary is always going to be a lot bigger than your active vocabulary. For instance, the other day I learned the Spanish word \"vendimia\", which means \"grape harvest.\" I am almost certainly not going to remember, much less ever use, that word. But if it comes up again I'll probably recognize it, or at least it will ring enough of a bell that I'll recall \"hm, something to do with grapes or wine?\" and be able to guess the meaning. Adding it to a vocab list would be a lot more trouble than it's worth.\n\nIf you're a beginner and struggle with reading native material it's a little different. I recommend reading on a screen so that it's easier to look up words. iOS and Kindle (and probably Android) will both let you install bilingual dictionaries so that you can highlight a word and immediately get its definition. Lingq and similar tools can also be useful, as others have mentioned. If you're into SRS, importing new words you see can certainly be helpful, but even then I would caution against adding anything you're unlikely to use in the immediate future. Language acquisition has a lot less to do with memorization than a lot of people think.\n\nSome relevant links on that [here](http://howtojaponese.com/2009/06/05/just-read-it/) and [here](https://www.sinosplice.com/life/archives/2020/09/29/how-not-to-learn-vocabulary).

Latin, for example, didn't really go extinct but evolved into other languages. Irish on the other hand *is* going extinct, and this has nothing to do with it borrowing things from English, which it's probably been doing for hundreds of years anyway. Japanese (or Chinese, or Korean, or Spanish, or any of the dozen of other languages that are currently absorbing English words) is not about to become extinct because of a few words in katakana. \n\nAnd if you're complaining about the perceived impurity of Japanese borrowing from English, why are you not focusing your attention on all the Chinese that's in Japanese? Your own example of \u82f1\u96c4\u9023\u76df uses the on'yomi of both words, and while I haven't looked up their etymology, they're almost certainly of Chinese origin. \n\nI realize that when you learn another language sometimes you're *hoping* to find something exotic and unknown to you, but I can assure you that loanwords don't preclude that. Spanish might seem similar to English, but when you're not talking in the high Latin-derived register that most Western European languages share, stuff gets very different very fast. Language borrowing isn't the de-purification of a language but a fascinating process that ultimately enriches it. Look at the French borrowings into English, and how words like \"pork\" and \"beef\" originally meant just meant \"pig\" and \"ox\", but through the process of borrowing have come to refer specifically to the meats. Now we have this really interesting distinction between animals (pig/cow) and the food they produce (pork/beef) which doesn't exist in most languages. All thanks to borrowing. \n\nEnglish has tons of French words like that. So does Swedish. Spanish has them from Arabic, Arabic has them from Persian, basically anything within striking distance of China has them from Chinese, Latin has them from Greek, and Greek has them from languages spoken in Greece so long ago we don't even know their names. \n\nEnglish happens to be the language of the hour, so it's what being borrowed from the most, but the process has been happening for much longer, and when Chinese or Martian or whatever the next big language is takes over, it will keep happening then.", "created_utc": "1496589168.0", "edited": "1496604345.0", "id": "dig28tj", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_6et1g1", "parent_id": "t1_die0r5i", "score": "11", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "EstoEstaFuncionando", "body": "You've mentioned your Polynesian heritage is important to you.
