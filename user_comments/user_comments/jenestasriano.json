I've had many positive reactions from grocery store workers about my zero waste habits (though I'm vegan so I don't go to the deli. I just mean using my own bags for the bread and not bagging produce).\n\nA third option is to go to a mom and pop butcher instead of the supermarket deli.

One Youtuber said she's never been turned down after saying that.

But what's important is that you're thinking about it. Most people don't notice and don't care. \n\nSo, to summarize: bulk stores are the best option, the second best option is going to a mom and pop bakery for bread with your own cloth bag, and to a mom and pop deli with your container (stainless steel probably does work best, and you can use the allergy excuse if they try to say something).\n\nAs for the orange juice.. I used to buy a lot of plant milks, and now I just make my own. You can make orange juice as well and store it in a glass bottle :). You'd be surprised how quick these things go.\n\nBut: even if you can't have the perfect plastic-free grocery haul, you can still reduce your impact in other areas:\n\nBathroom: Shampoo bar instead of shampoo bottle, safety razor instead of disposable razor, bamboo toothbrush.. etc.\n\nAnyway, good job on your first attempt at a plastic-free grocery haul and good luck with your next one :)", "created_utc": "1511300695.0", "edited": "False", "id": "dq5sqku", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_7edc0m", "parent_id": "t3_7edc0m", "score": "3", "subreddit": "ZeroWaste", "subreddit_id": "t5_2wf12"}, {"author": "jenestasriano", "body": "Is that a chain grocery store?

The only thing is that they are quite expensive for international students. It's around $14,000 USD for one year without housing / food.
