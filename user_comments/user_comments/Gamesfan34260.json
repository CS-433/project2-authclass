can be traced back to 1375 and has appeared in several literary works including by Shakespeare himself.  \nHowever, many prescriptivists (Folk who believe words are used how they are defined, not defined how they are used.) took great offense to this and proclaim it an error.\n\nIn the 17th century, a similar thing happened for singular you.  \nIt used to be plural (Or polite singular for royalty) but at this time, folk were saying those who use it in a singular fashion are fools.  \nAs you might have figured, singular you entered mainstream use and was accepted, although at the time schools were trying to beat this out of people (Probably in a literal sense.) despite the fact it was used for decades at this point. \n\nThey, however, has not left this precarious state despite appearing in history FAR earlier.  \nMany schools are still teaching that they can only be plural despite several dictionaries attesting otherwise, especially with public use.\n\nTL;DR: There are folk who try to stop language from evolving but only in ways they dislike.  \nI often find that these people who dislike \"singular they\" are transphobic, especially against NB folk.\n\n[You can read a
