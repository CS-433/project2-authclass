I've been on and off\u2014 keeping it on the back burner while I focus on Japanese\u2014 since I was 28, now I'm thirty but I have only had about a month's worth of study in total.

Why is it so much better than your Japanese accent?\" And while that kind of stung to hear, I was also surprised to learn that a guy who was native in both languages thought that my Mandarin was so much better than my Japanese, despite the fact that I've both studied less and started later in life.\n\nIt turns out that a lot of the research done in the sixties about the critical period has been more or less debunked. \n\nWe don't know if people can literally become native speakers, but they can definitely become good enough to trick people for a bit. For the longest time, people thought the one aspect of a language that foreigners couldn't pick up after childhood was pronunciation, but some researchers, like the Swedish neurologist Olle Kjellin and the American-Taiwanese language professor Karen Chung have argued that the critical period for pronunciation is not a critical period in age but one in study. If you learn pronunciation and train your ears from the beginning, you'll hear things correctly the first time\u2014 according to the research done by these thinkers, the reason people develop thick accents is because they practice talking incorrectly and practice listening before they can clearly hear what's being said. I practiced listening and trying to hear the sounds in Chinese and I try to only say things I know are correct, so I'm just more likely to say things correctly the first time. \n\nTeachers sell you the idea that you're never going to sound native anyway so they can get away with teaching you in a way that actively messes your accent up.", "created_utc": "1660358245.0", "edited": "1660361567.0", "id": "ik2xgu4", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_wmqosz", "parent_id": "t3_wmqosz", "score": "29", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "ewchewjean", "body": "The entire reason this argument even exists is because linguists noticed that we were doing the opposite.

And despite that, native speakers of AAE are able to speak their dialect with a grammatical precision that most non-native speakers fuck up. Native speakers can instantly tell the difference between someone like Eminem who speaks the dialect natively despite being white and someone who is just trying to sound black\n\nConversely, Japanese children are taught to read kanji over the course of 9 years, but many children who have an interest in reading end up learning kanji in significantly less time.\n\n Now, something to note here and with your their/they're/there example is that, in a strictly linguistic sense, written language is not the same thing as spoken language. It can be helpful to learn the basics at school, but once you do know the basics you are more likely being held back by sticking to the school's pace than you would be if you started reading on your own.

There's a lot of super specific vocabulary\u2014 you're learning about growing berries, using wavelengths to scan for Pokemon, training, fighting, exploring different kinds of places, biomes and towns, each Pokemon has its own little Pokedex entry and there's usually a sign describing every major area, there's different groups of people who talk to you about their ideologies and agendas. I know the game had some new vocabulary for me here and there but as someone who just took N1 this July and sat through the whole Nihongo no Mori N1 playlist, I can tell you that the manga at least had literally at least one N1 grammar point *per chapter*. \n\nThat said, I would recommend you get into native materials as soon as you can stomach it and start looking up/making flashcards for the words you don't know. One of the benefits of children's content like Pokemon or shonen anime is that because it's so wild and fantastical, and the setting and topic can change so drastically it usually covers a very broad range of vocabulary across different topics but never gets so deep that a child wouldn't be able to understand it, so it helps you develop a well-rounded vocabulary. \n\n If you're, like, moving to Japan in 18 months and need to be fluent in specifically everyday Japanese as fast as possible, I would instead recommend you play something like Ace Attorney or Summer Pockets, as well as reading something like \u3088\u3064\u3070\u3068, because those skew a bit more realistic and have fewer words that are just made up or only used in fantasy/sci-fi settings.

For example, Wolfgang Butzkamm and John Caldwell found in 2009 that while CI is necessary, it's not sufficient. Comprehension needs to occur at two levels before input can reliably be used in output\u2014 people need to understand the content as well as the form. Krashen argued that only understanding content was important\u2014 probably because Krashen was responding to a behaviorist model of education which only focused on form. Form is dictated by content, so there's some logic to what Krashen was saying... But when the Input Hypothesis claims that comprehensible input is both necessary and sufficient for acquisition, Krashen is wrong. It's necessary but not sufficient.\n\nIt's also worth noting that a lot of things Krashen says are drawing on earlier research and earlier hypotheses\u2014 you can't really understand what i+1 actually means unless you know that it's an attempt on Krashen's part to apply Lev Vygotsky's Zone of Proximal Development to teaching vocabulary and grammar in a predictable and consistent way. Many critics of Krashen have pointed out that i+1 is vague, and kind of sloppy. If Krashen had just directly stated \"people acquire language best when they input messages that are within their zone of proximal development\", that would be a lot less ambiguous scientifically, but it might be more ambiguous in the classroom teaching context that Krashen was discussing.", "created_utc": "1658459202.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ih53oqw", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_w49ea4", "parent_id": "t1_ih511pn", "score": "3", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "ewchewjean", "body": "Comprehensible input is not a hypothesis.

The majority of Japanese courses have long explanations in Japanese and then one or two example sentences for students to repeat. These sentences are out of context at best, often outdated, and sometimes just wrong. Recent reforms have mostly just added a lot more weird, out-of-context example sentences, that students often don't understand, but they don't need to understand them because they can repeat after the teacher until they're good enough at droning the chant out to impress mom and dad. \n\nThe Japanese explanation is not English. The example sentences are not English, though they resemble a very odd form of English that doesn't exist in real life. Professor Bill Van Patten refers to this kind of exercise as \"language-like behavior\"\u2014 something that resembles useful language, but doesn't reflect how the language is in real life at all. Some of this might transfer over in the event that students decide to learn English, but it's also teaching them a bunch of wrong things they'll have to try to unlearn later. They're learning a weird, dead conlang that happens to be (mostly) mutually intelligible with English. \n\nNobody who studies that way will become fluent by doing so, and I'm not saying that in some snoody \"if you're not literally passing as native you're not fluent yet\" way. If it's the only way they study, they'll have a hard time communicating, and whenever they open their mouth it will be immediately obvious that they've never heard someone speaking English before. Even if the school hires a native speaker to feed this to them. The stats agree with this\u2014 the only populations with rates of bilingualism as bad as Japan are English speaking countries where Spanish/Mandarin/Japanese et al are taught the same way.\n\nThis is where I can comfortably say that it's not an English teacher's job to encourage students to learn English. Encouraging students to do this pulls them further and further away from meaningful English study until one day they've been studying for over a decade and can barely talk. That's very much not \"encouraging students to learn English\". \n\nEven when you look at the reforms, you see that MEXT has been getting consultation from large corporate schools like Aeon for years. They tell MEXT what they've been telling customers for years\u2014 that Japanese people can understand English perfectly well, that they do just fine reading English and that what they need is more practice talking.\n\nExcept that as I've pointed out, most Japanese people have only ever read really weird fake English. They don't understand English, and so \"more practice talking\" involves shoving even more weird, out-of-context zombie sentences into their head, forcing students to repeat after the teacher...\n\nIt's in the private industry's best interests to have this kind of thing happen, as a student who struggles to learn for decades is a student who pays money for decades. It's in the best interests of nationalists, who don't want Japan to become any more Americanized than it already is. You may think the government is incompetent but governments are generally pretty good at doing what they want to do, even if their goals are themselves really stupid. I think MEXT and the private industry consultants they hire have done a very good job at giving the appearance of educational reforms and the appearance of a serious foreign language education while making sure that anyone who follows their example never learns English. \n\nTL;DR motivating people to do well in the Japanese English education system is the opposite of motivating them to learn English", "created_utc": "1658453791.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ih4s8j4", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_w1vluo", "parent_id": "t1_ih0jp1b", "score": "1", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "ewchewjean", "body": "The course material is not English, you're committing the reification fallacy.\n\n...

It doesn't happen everywhere, but as someone who does freeter work juggling multiple jobs, I get around. Some schoolteachers have preemptively lost hope in their students and don't want students focusing on stuff that's not going to be on the test, some dispatch companies have eikaiwa programs and want you to point to them as the way to learn English outside of class. In a way, that a dancing monkey is brought in to \"make English more interesting\" is itself kind of creating the expectation that English needs to be jazzed up to be interesting (i.e., that it's boring by itself). \n\n Of course in eikaiwa this all gets way stricter, but that's not public education. \n\nAnyway, I'm talking about broader trends moreso than what happens in an individual classroom. I'm not saying there's some shadowy cabal pulling the strings, but I can tell you that many of the corporations discussing English education reforms with MEXT *are* deliberately hoping to fuck students over (I have had higher-ups in these companies tell me as much themselves). The decisions made by these larger companies tends to ooze their way down to the small business level as most teachers have no background in SLA or linguistics and tend to copy some version of what big corporations trained them to do.

A is used to indicate that this cat, while specific, is new information to the listener.\n\nBut that rule is also not universally applicable. \nIf I were to tell someone I saw the Loch Ness monster, it would be wrong to say I saw a Loch Ness Monster, even if the person I'm talking to has no idea what I'm talking about, because a unique thing is always \"the\" whether it is new or old information. However, if I were to describe the Loch Ness Monster, I would say \"the Loch Ness Monster is a monster that lives in Loch Ness\", with a being used to indicate that \"monster\" is a general category into which I am placing the specific monster I have already introduced in conversation. \n\n If I were to tell someone who has never heard of France that I had been to a place called The Eiffel Tower, saying that I went to \"An Eiffel Tower\" is wrong for a similar reason. The Eiffel Tower is always the, the determiner has more or less become part of the name. Except that it hasn't; if you wanted to poetically or jokingly refer to \"The Eiffel Tower\" as yours, \"My The Eiffel Tower\" would still be \"My Eiffel Tower\". Tokyo Tower doesn't have a \"the\" as part of its name, and indeed many towers lack or have a \"the\" seemingly at random. \n\nSome words are countable, meaning they use a \"in general\" and the when being \"specific\"\u2014 but some words are uncountable. These never use a. But they do use the. Names are countable nouns that don't use a or the, unless as part of the name like above. A political commentator may say \"there are two Chinas\", but they'd never say that Taiwan is \"the China\"... Unless it's part of a larger phrase, such as \"Taiwan is *the* China established by Chiang Kai-Shek\", or part of an adjectival phrase like \"The PRC is *the* Communist China\".  Names of people are never used with a or the, though, unless you want to emphasize that you just met \"*a* Bill Gates\" and not \"*the* Bill Gates\". Non-name countable nouns in the singular must always have a determiner, however. And the and a are just two of many words that act as singular determiners , like \"my, his, her, this, that, which, what, John's, Mary's\".  \n\nAll determiners should be omitted when making general statements about countable nouns, which are always in plural form anyway\u2014 though the determiner \"some\" may be added to suggest you're not talking in general terms but about an actual group of things. However, that's a general group of things. A specific group of things would use \"the\". \n\nAnd many words have both countable and uncountable forms, often to communicate related concepts. For example, \"I like strawberries\" means a person likes the fruit, while \"I like strawberry\" means a person likes the flavor. This countable/uncountable divide can also apply in less conceptually distinct ways. A person who wants some pizza and a person who wants some pizzas are both indicating they want to get pizza, but person one is indicating a more general amount of pizza and person two is talking whole pizza pies. In both cases though, pizza that's already been ordered would be ,\"the pizza\". \n\nAnd that's before considering that some words might just be exceptions to this for whatever reason. Some words are uncountable, despite looking like they can be counted. Some things might be referred to by naming them, even though they're not something that would usually be named. Some words act uncountable in some ways despite being countable\u2014 especially loanwords from Japanese,  like \"kanji\" or \"ninja\". \"Ramen\" is a loanword from Japanese, but it's uncountable.\n\nThis may be a big or small headache to people from Western European countries, I don't know... but at least many who speak a language close to English have a general idea of words needing a determiner and how determiners work. East Asian languages do not have this concept. Nor do they have a concept of plural or singular form, or mixed countability (all Japanese words are uncountable), which as you can see ties into all this. \nSo when teaching beginners in Asia, you also need to be aware that ALL of this is just completely alien to them. \"I saw a cat\" in casual Japanese is literally just \u732b\u3092\u898b\u305f \"cat {OBJECT} saw\".\n\nYou can't teach all of these rules at once, or students will be overwhelmed. You can't teach these rules piecemeal or else students will start forming bad habits and overcorrect later, using one rule to fuck another rule up\u2014 \"I'm a Kimiko, I saw a the cat\", etc. You can't expect students to just practice talking until it eventually smooths out\u2014 they're probably going to get worse the harder they try if they aren't reading and listening\u2014 the correct answer isn't hiding in their mouth. \n\nIn my opinion, the only real way to get it down\u2014 and it's easier than I make it all sound above\u2014  is to read extensively and pick it up from context.  Some of this stuff they'll just start to notice and pick up. Some of the things I taught here might be useful to read up on a little bit later on, when they've got enough raw English into their head to even comprehend what's being explained. But eventually anyone who wants to actually get this down will have to just kind of read and listen as much as they can and see what words fall in what boxes where.", "created_utc": "1657027961.0", "edited": "1657085148.0", "id": "iexv3gt", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_vrr1gf", "parent_id": "t1_iexmdq6", "score": "13", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "ewchewjean", "body": "\u54c8\u54c8\u54c8\u54c8\u95ed\u5634\uff0c\u767d\u4eba", "created_utc": "1657015144.0", "edited": "1657086805.0", "id": "iexarwa", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_vlp7sa", "parent_id": "t1_iex9nkm", "score": "0", "subreddit": "worldnews", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13"}, {"author": "ewchewjean", "body": "Oh hey it's the world's only expat here to give us a PhD anthropology lesson", "created_utc": "1657014103.0", "edited": "1657086791.0", "id": "iex9k1g", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_vlp7sa", "parent_id": "t1_iex9fa1", "score": "1", "subreddit": "worldnews", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13"}, {"author": "ewchewjean", "body": "China has over 800 indigenous languages and three border colonies and you think it's monocultural because yellow people lmao", "created_utc": "1657012535.0", "edited": "1657013749.0", "id": "iex7qsa", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_vlp7sa", "parent_id": "t1_idzlg18", "score": "0", "subreddit": "worldnews", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13"}, {"author": "ewchewjean", "body": "We get it you don't care about the suffering of African people only white American Republicans get to be racist or whatever go be a lib elsewhere adults are talking", "created_utc": "1657012197.0", "edited": "1657013675.0", "id": "iex7d47", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_vlp7sa", "parent_id": "t1_iex39xy", "score": "0", "subreddit": "worldnews", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13"}, {"author": "ewchewjean", "body": "I think the disadvantages get larger and more noticable the wider the gap between languages is.

This is what I expected, and closer to the average for most educated first world countries. \n\nYes, of these, the top 5000 are often said, in English at least, iirc, to make up around 86% of all communication, but to suggest that 3000 words make up 90% of communication and that Japanese people only know 14,000 words is so completely absurd as to be almost racist. Japanese people and society would barely be able to function, let alone be one of the world's top 5 developed economies.\n\nAnd for those who don't understand basic math, 8.6%= \n8.6/10, 90%=1/10. That means that, every 10 words on average is going to have one word that's not a top word, and if my 86% applies similarly to Japanese that means almost every other ten words is going to have an extra rare word in it. That's 14 rarer words every 100 words. \n\nConsidering that some internet sources suggest that the average episode of a tv show (again, in English, I'm not going to pretend I know something about Japanese that I don't) has about 105 words per minute on average, and the average episode is 22 minutes, that's about 346-7 rarer words per episode.\n\n Assuming that words aren't related to other words, pretending that the constructionist model of learning (we learn stuff by relating new info to what we already know) was turned off, a person who only knew N2 level Japanese and nothing else would be functionally incapable of watching TV, doing basic life stuff, etc. They would be barely capable of functioning in society, if at all. In real life, it's easy to tell the meaning of a word like \u53c2\u6226 by inferring from context and previous knowledge (\u53c2\u6226=\u6226\u4e89\u306b\u53c2\u52a0\u3059\u308b\u3053\u3068), and a lot of these rarer words are obviously things like names that people don't consider as part of their vocabulary, so most people who reach N2 probably are comfortable. But there are going to be rarer words everywhere, constantly, every day if you have your eyes open for them. \n\nWhile the above poster is absurd to think that common words don't make up the majority of speech, I think in general both him and OP are kind of way way off. You may not see each individual N1+ word every day, but there won't be a day where you don't see some.  \u4e00\u671f\u4e00\u4f1a, as they say.", "created_utc": "1656946943.0", "edited": "1656948316.0", "id": "ietprn1", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_vpbxvz", "parent_id": "t1_iemxgd5", "score": "1", "subreddit": "LearnJapanese", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qyls"}, {"author": "ewchewjean", "body": "I noticed there was a trap specifically for Chinese people in the kanji part. \u52c7\u6562\u3000\u3086\u3046\u304b\u3093 seems like it would be \u3086\u3046\u304c\u3093 with rendaku, and \u6562 is gan in Chinese", "created_utc": "1656901367.0", "edited": "False", "id": "iershf0", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_vqazce", "parent_id": "t1_ieqqhjh", "score": "4", "subreddit": "jlpt", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s1e4"}, {"author": "ewchewjean", "body": "I did reading first so while the vocab and grammar were super easy for me this year I think I fucked up on the first (final for me) page because I had no time.

People like to say that watching TV is easy fun wahoo for weebs and unserious learners, but even if you only understand a percentage of the input you're getting, you're going to be at a point where you're drilling at least dozens, soon hundreds, eventually thousands of words with relatively little effort on your part.

I mean share holders invest money based on what the company is worth and can cash in their chips when the company has accrued in value, they can also lose money if the company looses out as well.\n\nYeah, so this discourages any kind of work that isn't profitable.  A big part of socialism is, yes, that trade would be conducted without investors controlling everything. Once upon a time, we had a system where investors didn't control the economy, before capitalism. Communism isn't about going back to feudalism per se, (though some leftists, like Slavoj Zizek, suggest that modern communist countries are just doing that\u2014 no actual communist society has ever existed and most modern communist parties claim they \"intend to achieve communism by 20\u00d7\u00d7\" but admit they're not communist), but is, yes, more or less entirely about the abolition of the capitalist class. Not just stock traders, but landlords etc as well. People who get rich off of the work of others. I know this sounds weird because welfare of any kind is often conflated with socialism/communism, and we do support welfare. But welfare should be to each according to their need, not over 90% of the money I earn going to one guy who got where he was because he already has money. \n\nYou mention that investing is a bit like gambling, and for most of the people at the bottom day-trading, it is. But for the people on top, the deck is stacked consistently in their favor. They control the house. And I for one think we can do better than having a rigged casino in charge of our whole political economy. \n\nI have tried to go freelance before, but if you tell a student honestly how language learning actually works (you have to read and watch TV/listen for thousands of hours before you can have a natural fluent conversation, the stuff we do in the classroom is a supplement at best and at worst it actively messes someone's accent up), they will point-blank refuse to believe you. And most of the people who get it just do self-study anyway. Teaching language is a job that actively wants students to quit if done correctly\u2014 you teach them how to start and then they take it themselves from there. So naturally, the private industry is all about nurturing dependence and manipulating students into thinking they could never figure out anything themselves. \n\nI try easing students into it now, and I've had a few successes here and there, but the problem with that approach is that people never feel ready and end up spending 1, 5, 10 years studying weird textbook English under the microscope and getting nowhere when they've never heard or seen what English actually is. \n\n There's an extent to this that is the customer's fault\u2014 it's the same reason fad diets and weight loss pills sell\u2014 but it's more profitable to sell a lie that people want to hear than to sell a truth people don't. \n\nIn a system that wasn't controlled by investors, people might still lie, yeah, but I wouldn't be in a situation where I have to choose between lying and getting the boot. It wouldn't be the entire industry. \n\nI also think it's a bit odd to say that I do this out of greed when I'm a teacher. It's not like I'm teaching my way into a 2-million dollar house and Coachella, I'm doing it so I can eat. And the majority of the money I make lying and cheating for food goes to the people above me.  I think a lot of the people here are looking for a way to avoid being exploited for money. There are fewer and fewer positions in the public sector, but if I was, say, a public university professor with tenure, I could just be honest with students and they'd have to deal with it, for better or worse.\n\n   Not saying China is Communist (if we go off of the Marxist definition of socialism, this \"capitalism without investors\" model, that's never existed), but they did just ban a huge swath of the private TEFL industry because they decided a lot of the stuff out there in the market was bad for children, and rightly so.", "created_utc": "1650410190.0", "edited": "1650411294.0", "id": "i5es90a", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_u5ytcv", "parent_id": "t1_i5bai6i", "score": "2", "subreddit": "Hasan_Piker", "subreddit_id": "t5_qs1n3"}, {"author": "ewchewjean", "body": "> if I were making something with my hands and the people that were doing lesser tasks that didn\u2019t require skill or some kind or hazard/ hard labor to accomplish that I wouldn\u2019t try to make the best bowl I could, I would just make something that sells because im not being compensated for the work I\u2019ve put in, it\u2019s the same either way \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n\nSee, the reason you're being downvoted is that you're just assuming this is the end result of socialist policy when it's *what we currently have under capitalism*\n\nIn a system where the workers control the profits, it's entirely possible that the doctors get more than the assistants or the janitors. The doctors could leverage their skills to arrange that when discussing where the money goes. But there would be a discussion and the money would be distributed among the people working at the hospital. \n\n Currently, there's a group of people called shareholders, who aren't doctors or bowl makers, truck drivers, assistants, or anyone who actually labors, who make almost all of the money. Assistants would likely not get as much as a doctor, but under the current system, they make a doctor's work possible while getting shit on, while some people who often don't work at the hospital at all get rich off their labor.\n\nFor example, I'm a foreign language tutor for a living, among other things. In a socialist system, yes, I might choose to teach in a way that sells instead of teaching in a way that is effective in helping my students learn a language. \n\nUnder capitalism, sacrificing quality for greed is literally *my only option*. Even public schools here in Japan have privatized English teachers who are often employed by people who also own private cram schools. \n\nThere are companies that attempt to do things correctly, but they're exceedingly rare\u2014 I only know one (and no, it's not the one I work at) in the whole country that operates off of basic language acquisition theory.

I have to take my qualifications off of my resume to get hired sometimes. \n\nAnd it's not just my industry.

The inner mechanics of how the brain is processing that information might be different (and the controversy you mentioned is mostly over whether it's fully different or just a worse version of the same thing, and whether those differences are neurological at all or socially constructed\u2014 say, by people telling other people on Reddit they need to use a reference book to understand that the old men in Monster don't talk like Master Roshi), \nIt's 100% the same at a practical level. \n\n Studies around the world, consistently, over the last four decades show that input is the necessary component for acquisition and that the benefits of conscious study are negligible for learners of all ages.

Different media has different levels of verisimilitude; you're just as capable of understanding that something is \u5f79\u5272\u8a9e through watching more anime as you are to understand it through combining anime with other forms of study.) \n\nalso because real-life young boys, who watch this stuff all day, absolutely DO talk like anime characters. As someone who works as a daycare Shonen anime Japanese is basically workplace Japanese for me. Also, not to put more words in your mouth but if you're trying to say \u304a\u524d is anime Japanese... lmao)\n\nThis is also only applicable to a small percentage of anime vocabulary. A more convincing argument would be if you were to say something like \"anime and manga can convince you that flowery, rare literary words like \u51cc\u99d5\u3059\u308b (\u512a\u308c\u308b) are used in daily life by common people\". \n\nYou are just as likely to sound unnatural with *any* other singular source of Japanese.

And that's also fine \u2014 you *will* sound unnatural, no matter what you use, until you reach a level of competence that lets you discern what kind of speech goes where.\n\n I'd be more convinced if you said something like \"manga can often use flowery language and people might think words \n\n\nIn fact, your insistence that:\n\n> But without reading explanations for the nuances of these words, or exposing yourself to a *wide* variety of native materials besides manga/anime, you're not going to learn how to properly communicate.\n\nSort of illustrates the flaw with the rest of your thinking and the reason I'm pointing it out\n\nYou have provided two options here:\n1) reading explanations\n2) exposing yourself to a wide variety of native materials\n\nIf your point was \"you need to read and watch a variety of things\", which is one of the options you presented, then sure. But that wasn't your point.\n\n Your point was explicitly that you have to \"build a foundation\" through study to \"learn grammar and vocabulary the old- fashioned way\"\u2014 through what I'm assuming is option 1 (explanations, looking stuff up), which is categorically false. \n\nEven if I were to look stuff up, it wouldn't make it necessary. I ate a bag of chocolate pretzels yesterday and I weigh a KG less today, but I'm not going to pretend the chocolate pretzels were a necessary part of my weight loss routine. \n\nEven lookups can be a crutch, which is why I'm making the warning I'm making. Study can speed things up but the only thing that actually improves your level is input. There is no way to prove or disprove the idea that I would have learned any individual word eventually without a lookup, or that the words I have learned without lookups only came because I had a foundation built through lookups. But there is academic research posted in this very comment section that supports the opposite.\n\nThe reason people do lookups and use study materials is largely for emotional support, out of belief that they need it, or out of the desire to speed up the process. \n\n> No. It's partially them, and partially people who think that postpubescent native English speakers can learn Japanese like native Japanese infants do, by simply being exposed to 1000s of hours of listening input alone. That's not going to work\n\nLook as someone who has taken several university-level courses on first language acquisition I'm just going to say that neither you nor the strawmen you're inventing here know anything about how babies learn language, so don't worry when I tell you that you're wrong and that adults learn language in exactly the same way, because babies are not \"simply being exposed to 1000s of hours of listening input alone\". \n\n But then again, anime by its very nature is not \"listening input alone\", is it? There are visuals and there's movement and context and all sorts of things that are not just \"pure listening\".\n\n>You do realize that sheltered input, graded materials and TPRS are all forms of *study* right? If you are using these methods to learn Japanese, then you are in fact studying, which just proves my point, that you need to study, and not just watch anime.\n\nAlso wrong! The purpose of these methods is an explicit attempt to recreate in classrooms and learning materials the same process that happens *when people watch anime*. This is because teachers and academic researchers know, as I've implied above, that explanations, \"study\" are not necessary and that pretending they are, again, has the danger of causing people to get their priorities wrong. I'm not saying you are intentionally trying to tell people to study textbooks for years before they immerse, I'm saying that the way you and other people dismiss anime as a learning material is dangerous and pushes people to go down that path.", "created_utc": "1648538759.0", "edited": "1648659856.0", "id": "i2jdgia", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_tqn7an", "parent_id": "t1_i2j6s2b", "score": "-8", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "ewchewjean", "body": "No, I understood it.

When high-level immersion learners mention reading something like Tae Kim or using Genki, many are very quick to caution people to \"just do enough to get the gist of the example sentence and then move on\"\u2014 Jazzy skipped the grammar study and opted for an \"immerse first, look up what I'm immersing if I don't get it\" approach and got way better results than even Doth, who spent a few months \"building that foundation\". This was on the test that every dedicated classroom program spends several years preparing people for.\n\n The reason people are so adamant about not spending time on this kind of stuff is that a lot of people end up staying at that textbook stage for years and make things way way harder on themselves. They essentially get a phd in anatomy while wondering why their body is still flabby and conclude that a second PhD in medical science must be necessary before they even consider a walk outside.  \n\nI'm being so adamant about my comment because, while anime isn't the only thing that I use, I still use weeb shit for study material quite a bit, and it doesn't cause any weird communication issues in my daily life. I also *did* use predominantly manga (not anime to be fair) until I was at a level where I could comfortably read the articles and the blogs and the novels, etc. Manga and anime are just more interesting than other stuff when you're below 95% comprehension, and so they're a very useful tool for getting the basics down.  I have a goal to get at least two hours of input in every day and the reductive way people say \"oh weeb stuff might give you a new word here and there but it's useless in real life\" discourages people from pursuing what may be the only thing that will give them the hours they need to even start tackling the more \"serious\" stuff. And it's also wrong\u2014 the way people downplay the amount of useful vocabulary you can get from anime, or who say it's \"not real Japanese\"\u2014 you'd think Japan is some crazy society where kid's television networks invented new words for every single object and that learning \u7a93\u3079 and \u304b\u3089 from the lyric \u7a93\u8fba\u304b\u3089\u3084\u304c\u3066\u98db\u3073\u7acb\u3064 means you learned the wrong word for windowsill and the wrong word for \"from\" and that \"\u53ef\u611b\u3044\" is some weird literary Japanese that nobody uses in real life. \n\nI think what you are describing when you say \"weebs who say they only used anime\" is simply people who aren't studying seriously, and to that I'm offering the warning for anyone reading that it's just as easy to fool yourself into thinking that buying a textbook and taking a class means you are taking study seriously, when academic research pretty strongly suggests it's not. Study might provide an exp modifier but comprehensible input is still the only thing that rewards exp points.

AJATT (not MIA/Refold, which were made by Matt VS Japan\u2014 *AJATT*) allows people to speak from day one, so long as the people speaking know what they're saying. This naturally leads to restricted speech and a focus on input in the beginning, when you don't understand anything, but any amount of speech is allowed if you don't start trying to say stuff you don't know. It's only Matt VS Japan (ironically, given his video exploring this is titled \"is early output a sin?\") Who suggests no speaking at all until B2.\n\n Everyone else in the hardcore Japanese immersion community simply recommends *focusing* on input as all output naturally has input as a prerequisite\u2014 you can't use grammar you haven't encountered, you can't say words you don't know.

This input elicits activation of neurons throughout the auditory system and may elicit subsequent semantic or other associations. What Hebb\u2019s rule suggests is\rthat the mechanisms of synaptic modification will tend to stamp in whatever pattern it was that the\rinput turned out to elicit. Experiments on potentiation suggest that the stronger the elicited activation, the stronger the effect will be and the longer it will last. The result will be an increase in the\rprobability and the efficiency of a subsequent, very similar input to produce the same activation.\rTo the extent that the activation is appropriate and useful, effective acquisition and maintenance of\rdesirable cognitive abilities will occur. But to the extent that the activation is inappropriate, Hebbian synaptic adjustment will tend to stamp in existing tendencies, and progress in acquiring the\rdesired or appropriate response will not occur. I will argue in what follows that failures of learning in amnesia and failures to acquire non-native speech contrasts in adult second-language learners\rmight both arise from undesirable strengthening of inappropriate pre-existing activations.

The Wikipedia article for language immersion?](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_immersion)\n\n> Pre-production: also called \"the silent period,\" this period lasts 10 hours to 6 months in language immersion environment. Students may have about 500 receptive words in their mind but cannot speak the language yet. During this mimicking period, students are likely to repeat everything that they heard in class and can respond to pictures and yes-or-no questions by using their gestures like nodding or shaking their head. The class must integrate pictures and physical response methods.[6]\nEarly Production, in which students can master about 1000 receptive and active words, lasts six months after the pre-production stage. Students can answer simple questions, like yes-or-no questions. They also can repeat and use two-word phrases. They might not use patterns correctly, but they can discover the problem. This is a self-discovery period.[16]\nSpeech Emergence, in which students will have about 3000 active words, lasts one year after the early production stage. Students can answer simple questions and use three or more words in simple phrase and patterns. Students can understand the general idea of a story with pictures and may not be able to use the patterns correctly, but they can correct some of them by themselves. This is also called a self-correcting period. Teachers focus on conversations in class during this stage.\n\nOh man, looks like many children in *immersion programs* don't even talk for 6 months and even then only answer in simple 1-3 word phrases for the first year after that. They should really consider renaming their program an \"input-only program\" or \"input-focused program\", huh. \n\n Considering Benny Lewis got far enough to fail a B1 test (and somehow passed the A2 test in the same timeframe even though both tests are held simultaneously once every 6 months?) in less than half the time it took an Immersion learner to ace a B2 test, I bet people who go to immersion schools have [terrible language skills.](https://youtu.be/gzWEHyD0rzc)", "created_utc": "1647795489.0", "edited": "1647798693.0", "id": "i1f8q7u", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_th0qq4", "parent_id": "t1_i1f4nvr", "score": "2", "subreddit": "LearnJapanese", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qyls"}, {"author": "ewchewjean", "body": "What are *you* basing your claims on?

Unless you are very dedicated, very patient, and ***very*** lucky, you can expect to end up making less than $25,000 a year with no raises, promotions that have a 10:1 responsibility-raise to pay-raise ratio, and to basically be the laughing stock of every immigrant and expatriate community.\n\nYou will not be teaching \"the fundamentals and linguistics of English\" as an entry level teacher.

You will be teaching outdated, grammar-translation/forced drilling lessons that are so bad the modern science of psycholinguistics itself grew out of explaining why they don't work. The \"grammar\" you teach is demonstrably wrong, for example you might be teaching students that you need to put an \"a\" or \"the\" before every noun only to correct them later when they listen to you and then say things like \"Mr. a Teacher\" and \"I'm a Kimiko\".\n\nYou'll want to teach it in a different way that's, I dunno...

Most modern research into SLA says that learning a language *is* input. The textbook, if and when it is important, is only important as a supplement.\n\n2) I don't want to get into the reeds on how grammar guides and textbooks are different, but the biggest difference between what immersion-based methods advocate for and what traditional teachers advocate for is the emphasis and weight placed on what. (I.e., the belief that these tools are just a supplement)\n\nTo someone advocating an immersion-based approach, textbooks and grammar guides are only useful insofar as they help make input more comprehensible. If you can understand a piece of grammar in media from context without needing the grammar guide's explanation (and trust me, those moments will come more and more often the more you read), you didn't need it. On the contrary, the opposite is less true. You're more likely to be awkward with a piece of grammar you've only seen in a book; you need to see it in the wild to get a sense of how and when it's really used.\n\nAnd if you develop a wrong idea of the grammar from the guide, you'll only get rid of that wrong understanding once you see usage of Japanese that directly contradicts what you read, which may not come for a long time (for an example, I learned from my class in college  that people can't say \u3007\u3007\u3092\u597d\u304d, but it's actually a common feature of the Tokyo dialect. It's just emphasized in the grammar guides because \u304c is more common and Japanese people themselves would view \u3092 as \"incorrect\", the same way we have weird bs grammar rules in English that aren't true like \"*ain't* isn't a word\")(and also probably because my professor was from Shizuoka).

And yeah, a Japanese person being this emotional would sound like this. Maybe they'd only display this level of emotion if they were messing around, but they do mess around from time to time. \n\n Second, it would take you less than a week to go from learning the basic language through anime to understanding the pronunciation of a conversation or an NHK broadcast.

Oh, and the grammar is so simple that no foreigner has ever made a mistake, there's definitely not a subreddit dedicated to English mistakes called r/Engrish because English is so easy that nobody would ever oh no wait why does that link work?\n\nIronically, you know what language actually has no agreement or cases, very little inflection, and is also mistakenly called \"a language with no grammar\"? Mandarin Chinese. \n\nChinese literacy is lower (at 96%) because people in China are poor, ok? You'd be illiterate too if you lived in a shack in the countryside while everyone educated enough to teach you left your village to work in Shanghai. \n\nSeemingly ironic that you bring simplified up, as the literacy rate in Taiwan, Hong Kong and Japan are much higher than China's (98% in Taiwan and 99% in Japan, equal to America's and historically higher\u2014 Japan's literacy rate has been 99% seemingly for centuries despite America's being 90% as far back as 1950.), despite Taiwan and Hong Kong's use of traditional characters and Japanese's writing system taking the written word as a concept to the absolute limit of it's potential. Chinese characters didn't need to be simplified, and the person who simplified it was a dictator who murdered people and put them in forced labor for being educated. \n\nYou want to pretend reading Mandarin is hard? Japanese people read the letter \u751f officially as {sei, shou, nama, ikiru, ikasu, haeru, hayasu, iku, umu, umaru, naru, musu, u, asa, iki, so, sou, Ike, iku, e, oi, gyuu, kurumi, gose, jou, ou, umai, chiru, naba, niu, nyuu, fu, mi, mou, yoi, and ryuu}, and alternatively as whatever reading the author chooses (that's right, Japanese authors and poets routinely just decide they're gonna use whatever letters they want to write words and you just have to deal with it). \n\nIn Mandarin, people read \u751f as sh\u0113ng. Just sh\u0113ng. It's almost always sh\u0113ng, and the only variant is sheng(with no tone). Mandarin characters are more consistent than English letters. The letter \u751f and indeed most Chinese letters are easier to read than the letter A. \n\nAnd yet, despite Japanese being \"objectively harder to read\" than Chinese, the American government embarrassed itself trying to convince Japanese people to drop kanji in the postwar occupation, only to discover that... As stated above, Japan was 99% literate and had been for centuries, despite the US having a 90% literacy rate at the time. \n\nIt turns out that the way people learn to read is by just spending time reading. People who read more read better and make fewer mistakes, that's pretty much it.

I as an educator am forced (partly by state standards and partly by capital interests) to intentionally hinder the education of my students. The more professional development I do as an educator, the more skill I develop, the more I as a worker am being squandered. \n\nMy specific industry (foreign language education, though I sometimes teach other subjects now) is based almost entirely around the exportation and systemization of uselessness, to the point that being useful to the customer is often an act of rebellion that can get a person fired. \n\nThis is not unique to the foreign language teaching industry. A huge number of jobs are rendered useless by market forces: \n\n- Many video game designers who make the very games you claim you want to play all day are forced to make their games unfun and frustrating so that publishers can monetize solutions to the problems they created. \n\n- Dating apps like Tinder (almost all owned by Tinder's parent company, Match Group, by the way) are specifically designed to punish users for the act of trying to get a date (Tinder claims to have changed this but it was and likely still is based on an elo system, in which every swipe that is not a match decreases the rank of a user and thus makes the other users on the platform less likely to see their profile, reducing the chance of a future match). \n\n- Many technological devices (smart phones, computers, etc) are built with planned obsolescence in mind.  \n\n- Professional artists often have to sacrifice their personal vision for marketability. This is doubly true in the case of anticapitalist art produced within a capitalist society\u2014 see the struggles behind the productions of films like Brazil and Sorry to Bother You. This means that creatives are forced to be less creative\u2014 most comedians will tell less creative jokes to aim at a general crowd, musicians will make less creative music so their music might sell to am established music market, etc. \n\n- Any restaurant/food producing company that has both meat and vegan products is using vegan money to hinder the cause of veganism. \n\n- Antidepressants often make people gain weight, and insecurity over one's body image is depressing.\n\n- People would probably acclimate to BO (and do as far as I know in societies that lack it, I don't care to research it) in a world without deodorant, meaning that deodorant actively makes us perceive odor as fouler\n\n- Journalists and editorialists would be (are, have been) fired for informing people or providing their actual opinions. \n\n- a suicidal person who is confined to a suicide ward is significantly more likely to attempt suicide again than a person who is not\n\n- High police activity increases crime rates \n\nThe goals of capitalism\u2014 sustained growth and profit\u2014 are very often specifically and intentionally against the interests of satisfying the needs of the customer, and of allowing the worker to do actual meaningful work.

Native teachers were introduced into the school system and dominate the private teaching industry, where they are often picked over significantly more qualified non-native applicants.\n\nIn the audio-lingual method, students are expected to repeat after the teacher, be it specifically what the teacher says or a substitution of one or two words within a sentence template, a call-and-response, or so on. \"Repeat-after-me\". Students may be asked to repeat sentences they don't fully understand, and indeed the underlying grammar of the sentence is often left unexplained.\n\nNoam Chomsky attacked the method in *A Review of B.F. Skinner's Verbal Behavior.*  \nhttps://chomsky.info/1967____/ \n\nBy the way, this response features Chomsky's \"new utterances\" argument.\n\n>>It is also perfectly obvious that, at a later stage, a child will be able to construct and understand utterances which are quite new, and are, at the same time, acceptable sentences in his language. Every time an adult reads a newspaper, he undoubtedly comes upon countless new sentences which are not at all similar, in a simple, physical sense, to any that he has heard before, and which he will recognize as sentences and understand; he will also be able to detect slight distortions or misprints. Talk of \u201cstimulus generalization\u201d in such a case simply perpetuates the mystery under a new title. These abilities indicate that there must be fundamental processes at work quite independently of \u201cfeedback\u201d from the environment. I have been able to find no support whatsoever for the doctrine of Skinner and others that slow and careful shaping of verbal behavior through differential reinforcement is an absolute necessity. \n\nCorrect me if I am wrong but I was taught in my Intro to Linguistics class that this argument is, despite the controversy around Chomsky, one of the most important arguments in modern linguistics. \n\nSo you can imagine that a method whose rejection contains one of the foundational ideas of modern linguistics is probably going to be preeeeeetty bad. Indeed, elsewhere in the world it has been largely abandoned. When you hear expat English teachers complain that they're being forced to teach methods that haven't been updated since the 70's, they're referring to this.\n\nThis leads to students having very little input (which as someone else mentioned here, Krashen found to be critical), and that the speaking they do is often done without thought and based on strict repetition of sentences they didn't come up with and don't fully understand. This teaches students to think that English is harder than it actually is, and in addition leads to the forming of calcified errors and stilted speech patterns.\n\nTo combat this, teachers are often instructed to praise students effusively... Which some researchers such as Leo Van Lier, Carol Dweck, etc. suggest ironically kills a student's self-confidence over time. This is because of several factors that I can talk about forever (I'm currently working on an article on this specific topic), but the distilled argument is that:\n\n- Students need to understand that English ability is a skill they can improve and not a fixed thing they're either good or bad at.\n- Students are often afraid of evaluation from an authority and even positive evaluation is prone to make some people self-conscious.\n- Students need to have confidence in themselves and praise at best is not coming from within the students\n\nNow, I have met at least one slightly infamous man in the private Eikaiwa industry who has admitted that his company intentionally uses praise to undermine student confidence and sell more product. Which points to a reason why this is all unlikely to improve: privatization.\n\nBecause of the large-scale privatization of the industry, there's a massive disconnect between academic research and the classroom.
