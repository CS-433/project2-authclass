ADHD really messed my life up.\n\n\nHowever, yeah. I have noticed that there is a slightly toxic......enabling?  attitude on this sub as of late.  It used to be about recognising the hurdles that ADHD puts up and helping each other overcome them.  Now there's a lot more 'Well, you're ADHD, what can you do about it?' than 'OK, you're ADHD, here's what i think you can do about it'.\n\n\nIt's OK to regret being diagnosed late in life.  It's OK to be frustrated about how hard things are.  It's OK to vent and to ask for help.  It's not OK to throw your hands up and say 'I'm giving up' or 'the world should accommodate me' because the hard truth is *the world won't accommodate us*.  Most people in this world aren't ADHD and so we need to figure out unique ways to work with our brains to be successful anyway, and it's important that we all boost each other up as much as we can because life can't get better if we don't.\n\n\nIt's like...it's like if you had social anxiety, and everybody was so understanding that they invited you even though you never responded, and nobody ever made you leave your house, and somehow all your bills were paid without you ever needing to talk to anyone, ever.  Isn't that wonderful?  You never have to deal with your condition and you can live in your comfort zone forever!!  Except...what kind of life is that?!  Who's going to be truly happy never leaving the house, never interacting even to say hello, never doing anything?  The vast, vast majority of humans *need* interaction, we need *touch*, we need to *communicate*.  Shutting yourself up might make your social anxiety happy but it would make every other cell in your body depressed as fuck.\n\n\nAnd the same with ADHD.  In order to live a happy life, we need to get shit done.  We need to control our tempers and emotions.  We need to be able to respond to people even when distracted/focusing.  A permanent deadline extension won't make getting the job done easier, it'll ensure it never gets done -- and no matter how happy we'll be procrastinating, we'll still hate ourselves for never accomplishing anything.", "created_utc": "1666883776.0", "edited": "False", "id": "itzy857", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_yeqlm2", "parent_id": "t3_yeqlm2", "score": "-2", "subreddit": "adhdwomen", "subreddit_id": "t5_31aao"}, {"author": "himit", "body": "> They were saying it's not known if drinking alcohol whilst pregnant is harmful but it's safest not to drink whilst pregnant.\n\nYou sure they weren't saying \"It's not known *what amount* of alcohol whilst pregnant is harmful so it's safest not to drink whilst pregnant\"?  Since that's the actual medical fact.\n\n\nA single glass of wine isn't going to harm the baby.  Alcohol in Month 2 and alcohol in Month 8 are thought to be very different (due to placenta being developed and in place after Month 3). Drinking a small amount regularly during pregnancy was once medical advice in some countries (with no harmful effects recorded).\n\n\nHOWEVER, too much alcohol can result in defects and fetal alcohol syndrome.  How much? And at what point during pregnancy?  We don't know, because it's not exactly ethical to ply a bunch of pregnant women with different amounts of alcohol and see which ones give birth to disabled babies.\n\n\nSo we say it's safest not to drink.  Why is it not 'never drink during pregnancy'?  Because women are human too, and sometimes life gets so stressful and a drink would be nice, and stress is also extremely bad for the baby.  So the advice is 'It's best not to drink at all as we don't know how much alcohol is harmful to the baby'.  Most women will refrain from drinking or have 1-3 drinks (total) throughout their whole pregnancy. Some might have a drink a week.  Then there are the women who have Problems who will be drinking as much as they humanly can regardless, but who will be much more likely to mention that to their doctor if the advice is 'We don't know how much will hurt baby so it's best not to drink' than if the advice is 'Drinking will hurt your baby and you should not do it'.", "created_utc": "1666883173.0", "edited": "False", "id": "itzwp0w", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_yehvgg", "parent_id": "t1_itysl6d", "score": "8", "subreddit": "australia", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh8e"}, {"author": "himit", "body": "no worries!", "created_utc": "1666880716.0", "edited": "False", "id": "itzqkgk", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_yep6r7", "parent_id": "t1_itzo0el", "score": "2", "subreddit": "miraculousladybug", "subreddit_id": "t5_39tdz"}, {"author": "himit", "body": "[Not what you're looking for, but features loopy on pollen Marinette walking into windows](https://archiveofourown.org/works/27184304)\n\nI've read the one you're looking for.

In a very fucked way post brexit\n\nIt is quite true -- I think what a lot of people don't remember is that pre-2016 there was this massive sense of apathy permeating the western world because we'd changed governments and *nothing had gotten better*.  Things were actually decent, but they hadn't gotten better, the problems were still problems and slowly worsening, and politician after politician promised change and then did shite all but keep the wheels turning, and it had been that way since 2003 or so.  It felt like everything being done was for the top of society and nobody was listening to the issues felt by the people at the bottom (which, combined with the post-OWS divisive media stance, is why a lot of the worse movements started appearing --  Tea Party, Incels, MAGAs in the US, UKIP here).\n\n\nIn 2016 I would have voted for both Brexit and Trump -- not because I really wanted either, but because at least things would bloody change.  Luckily I didn't vote in either election (was living overseas an ineligible) because holy shit I learnt to regret ever having that opinion extremely quickly.  But I do think it's worth noting that both Trump and the Brexit camp were the only people actually addressing the concerns people at the bottom felt  -- Trump was going to the coal miners, Brexit campaigners talked about the NHS and education (that had been squeezed by underfunding and that issue was most visible in areas with high levels of migration).  They were peddling bullshit, but they were talking about it, when everyone else was just 'You know it's a bad idea this is ridiculous' (I still maintain that most people who voted for Brexit or Trump did it because they felt listened to for the first time in over a decade, and one of the first rules of sales is that customers buy from people who make them feel listened to).\n\n\nSo anyway. In 2016, both Britain and America burnt their shit down, which caused the rest of the Western world to think 'Hm. Hang on. Maybe boring is better' (a lesson I think Europe's starting to forget judging by some of their recent election results).\n\n\nHopefully it doesn't get worse than this, but I'm knocking on wood before I post this just in case.", "created_utc": "1666712465.0", "edited": "False", "id": "itqgvsp", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_ycyoxn", "parent_id": "t1_itpcr13", "score": "15", "subreddit": "unitedkingdom", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhqb"}, {"author": "himit", "body": "MarioKart Tour baby", "created_utc": "1666658793.0", "edited": "False", "id": "itnvjxo", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_yceagl", "parent_id": "t1_itn6u9e", "score": "7", "subreddit": "london", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qkog"}, {"author": "himit", "body": "That was my immediate reaction, too -- HOW do you confuse an 18 month old for a 3 year old?  18 months is still a baby, with the baby hair and baby cheeks and everything!

I've just run the numbers pretty blindly for my area, but that's \u00a3130/week they give you, and then the standard allowance for a single person over 25 is \u00a3330/month so like... \u00a3850/month?  Minimum wage life, baby.  After \u00a3700 in rent that's terrifying.\n\n\nOne of the worst things I can see about UC -- if you've *always* been on it or near the breadline, it's not too awful, because you'll already have expenses in line with the amounts you'll get.\n\n\nSo, for example, my family's been on it for about a year but we went on it a few months after moving back to the UK, and obviously our funds were really limited by the move so we were basically living as cheaply as possible anyway.  Going from the expected income to UC wasn't really a pay cut to us.\n\n\nBut if you've been employed and earning decent money and then lose that job, you really need to have savings or you're fucked, because you'll have bills that were affordable to your income and not bills that were semi-affordable on UC.  And you can't exactly downsize quickly while you job hunt because that means paying at least a grand in deposits and moving expenses and all that nonsense, so you're stuffed.  Let's say the average person in my area makes like, \u00a31700/month after tax.  There's no way they're saving \u00a3900/month, so their bills are gonna be way more than the UC allowance of \u00a3850.\n\n\nRather than a long-term benefit, a lot of countries have a type of short-term unemployment insurance -- you receive a reasonable percentage of your previous income for, say, 26 weeks.  It'd be nice if we could combine that with UC so that people who suddenly lose their jobs don't have to scramble when they're probably still reeling.", "created_utc": "1666355699.0", "edited": "False", "id": "it73otm", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_y9gdug", "parent_id": "t1_it71h2j", "score": "4", "subreddit": "unitedkingdom", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhqb"}, {"author": "himit", "body": "If you have kids you get a bit more, but even then it's tough.

If I wasn't making any money at all we'd have gotten I think about \u00a31900?  Which, when rent is \u00a31600.......is fucking tight.\n\n\nIf we didn't have kids, that would be \u00a31400ish, all up, which yeah, doesn't cover rent.  (Though if we didn't have kids hopefully we'd be living somewhere much cheaper.)\n\n\nThey work out your housing allowance based on (a) the area you live in, and (b) how many rooms you're allowed to have.  So, we have two small kids, we're allowed to have a two bedroom place, and the maximum they can pay us in this area for two bedrooms is \u00a31400ish.  When grandma was living with us we were allowed a 3 bedroom so they gave us \u00a31500ish (even though we only had a 2 bedroom - that was the allowance for a 3 bed).  If it was just as a couple we'd probably only be allotted a single bedroom and there's a maximum they can pay for that (which may or may not be more than your rent; if it's more than your rent, they pay the amount you pay in rent).\n\n\nHow it's structured is \n\nHousing allowance + any dependent allowance + your personal/couple allowance.   Then they deduct money from the total allowance for any amounts you make over \u00a3800 or so.  So you have to go through all the calculators to figure out how much you'll get exactly.\n\n\nThere are also a bunch of programmes and stuff you can apply to for cheaper/subsidised bills if you're on UC, but you need to research and apply to each separately and I never did because I figured there are always people worse off than us who need them more.

It did most of what it set out to do.  As a bonus, he cut Ladybug off from the guardian's support and got a translation of the grimoire.\n\n\nTBH Hawkmoth is more than a little impulsive (family trait? Adrien is too).  He's also quite emotional, like Adrien, but like Adrien he's good at acting otherwise.  If he'd sat on the miracle box for a while he would definitely have come up with a better plan; unfortunately for him, he's so impulsive that he saw a chance to gain the upper hand and he raced after it.\n\n\nWe see him do the same thing in Evolution -- >!he immediately goes to use the Rabbit to go back in time and grab the earrings and ring, instead of stepping back and carefully considering his options.!<  He's like 'I have Thing, Most Obvious Problem, Most Obvious Solution, lets go baby'.\n\n\nIn his defence, he's a fashion designer, not a....well, not any occupation known for using their brain.  Fashion design requires a very high level of knowledge in a very niche area, but it's not like he needs to be smart at literally anything else.  And he's really not.\n\n\nEDIT: I'll also argue that Gabriel is quite obsessive and that clouds his judgment  (I've seen it argued that Marinette and Gabriel are foils and yeah, i think this mirrors the obsessive sides of Marinette pretty nicely).  At the time of Miracle Queen he'd been obsessed with Chloe for a season -- he targeted her pretty relentlessly from the moment she picked up the comb, and even after Ladybug stopped giving it to her he kept going after Chloe.  He's obviously obsessed with his wife, and somewhat with Adrien being the Perfect Son(tm).  He becomes obsessed with defeating Ladybug (leading to his loss in Evolution).   As far as I can see in Multiplication, >!I think he gets pretty obsessive over his ring plan, too!< \n\n\nWhatever his current obsession is tends to blind him to the other factors at play in the moment.  A less obsessive, less emotionally-driven man would have likely imprisoned the Guardian in his lair and spent time developing a plan with the Miracle Box.  An even *slightly* less obsessive, less emotionally-driven man would have managed to claw a bigger win out of the Miracle Queen fiasco once he saw how the tide was turning.  However, this is Gabriel, who's obsessive, impulsive, emotional, and doesn't score too high on the logical thinking side of the scale.\n\n\nI suppose at least he pays well, otherwise Nathalie would've quit long, long ago.

In those 6 months, they probably learnt a lot of new skills, met some new people, learnt some new information bit by bit.

They might not be ready to defeat him right away -- they could go up against him and lose.\n\n\nOR, let's say they're told who he is, and told not to face him until Y date.  However, in those 6 months of waiting, they're operating based on the knowledge that a) Gabe is hawkmoth, b) they will defeat him on Y date.  Therefore, they're making completely different decisions than they had in the original timestream.  So in this same 6 months, they're now likely to learn different things and meet different people...and now Y date might roll around and they lose, because they were lacking a certain skill or piece of information that was integral to defeating him that they'd only learnt the first time round because they *didn't* know who Hawkmoth was.\n\n\nDoes that make sense?  \n\n\nIt's like...we don't know which seemingly inconsequential decisions we make are actually Big Deals.

Teenagers ARE all over the place.  It's perfectly possible to develop feelings for 2 or more people at the same time, and it's possible to be telling yourself one thing (I love Adrien!) while acting in a completely different way (Ladybug flirts with Chat Noir *relentlessly* right from the pilot ep, swaying her hips, giving him doe eyes, and touching him all the time). Likewise, Adrien constantly says 'Marinette is just a friend!' but acts quite differently (shows off to her, gets in her personal space a lot, goes out of his way for her in ways we don't see him go out of his way for other people).  Feelings are complicated and they're not always easy to name or communicate, especially when you're a young teenager and having a lot of these feelings for the first time.  And, like they say, actions speak louder than words.\n\n\n~~My personal theory is that Adrien knows he likes Marinette but he likes Ladybug more, and doesn't want to hurt Marinette because he knows she actually likes him...but won't give her space to get over him because he *likes* her, which is kinda like what Ladybug does to Chat Noir as time goes on.

As somebody else has mentioned, hold the hair above where you're brushing - the idea is so that any pulling is between the brush and your hand, not the brush and the scalp.  Once you've done all the hair at the bottom, move up and do all the hair from like a mid-way point, then you can remove your hand and it should go through nice and easily all the way round.\n\n\nBrushing technique is important -- my daughter is still terrible at it (I suspect on purpose) and she manages to put more knots in when she brushes.\n\n\n(I actually don't like the kind of brush you've bought, I like the more solid ones with the little round bits on the end.  The one you've got needs to be handled a bit more slowly to make sure you don't tear the hair.)\n\n\nFor some reason people don't use conditioner on their kids.  Use it.  Adult conditioner!  You can get a 2-in-1 if you need to, but normal conditioner will be better.  I've used adult shampoo and conditioner on my children since they were babies because I noticed that the children's versions leave their hair dry and easily-knotted (requiring things like leave-in conditioner or detangling spray).  When you wash their hair, put shampoo in, rinse out, then put conditioner in, and rinse it out (properly. if you leave conditioner in it'll be greasy and awful).  I (white) really like pantene, but my daughter's hair (mixed race east asian/white) responds better to tresomme.  You can grab some of the little 100ml bottles to figure out what brand works best.\n\n\n(Since my children don't like having their hair washed I get the 2-in-1 for them and we use that regularly, then if I notice their hair getting a little bit messier than normal I'll make them do a shampoo + conditioner one night.  But for general upkeep, 2-in-1 should be fine.)\n\n\nPantene sells little bottles of hair oil for about \u00a33.  Grab one, stick it near wherever the hair stuff is kept.  If I notice my daughter's hair (or my own) is getting dry, I'll put a drop or two on the hair and comb it through.  (The hairdresser actually recommended I do this when my hair's wet for better effect.)   You can use it really sparingly - my little bottle's lasted me for over 2 years so far.\n\n\nThis is basically my 'hair care routine' - I have hair down to my waist, and everytime I go to a hairdresser they're shocked at how healthy it is.  Just make a note of it's condition when you're brushing it and if you notice it's getting dry (there are individual strands flying everywhere/puffing up), then add a bit of extra moisture in the form of a hair oil or conditioner at night.\n\n\n(If you notice it's really bad right now, buy one of those 'hair treatment' things for moisture - again, pantene does them, but a few other brands do too - should be like \u00a35.  Wash her hair, condition her hair, pop the treatment on, play in the bath for 10 minutes or however long, then rinse it out.  That should give you a better base to work with!)\n\n\nNote that *none* of this is relevant if your little girl has curly hair.  Curled hair needs to be taken care of differently -- there's a LOT of info out there on 'natural hair' maintenance and care if she's black, and similarly there's a 'curly hair method' for curly hair if she's white. Curly hair definitely requires more upkeep but is absolutely beautiful if you stay on top of it; curly hair care can be good quality time!", "created_utc": "1664896240.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ir0wiqg", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_xvaqpt", "parent_id": "t1_iqzxdcw", "score": "2", "subreddit": "CasualUK", "subreddit_id": "t5_3j2jr"}, {"author": "himit", "body": "3-bed flats in the east are going for \u00a3600k and 2-beds are slightly cheaper.

Mergers, for some reason, always seem to require a great pile of translated documentation for filing purposes. The filing deadline is almost always end of financial year or just after, but with how complicated mergers are the translations are always done in good time.\n\n\nExcept for in this particular instance, where, somehow, Merged Big Company *completely* forgot about the translation requirement until March rolled around and the April deadline loomed.

Even things that happened the week before would be out of reach, almost like there was this big white mental wall between me and the experience I wanted.\n\n\nDiscussing the questions with friends was always really helpful, though, because they'd immediately say things like 'Oh but what about the time you did...' or 'Don't you remember when you used to...' and it was like they were pulling stuff from the other side of that wall and tossing it to me and suddenly I could remember it! It's really weird.\n\n\nSo like...\n\n>I feel attached to my friend even though he is abusive -- it's because he was the only one there and who remembers parts of my life. If it wasn't for him, there's a lot of things I can't remember or explain about my life.\n\n\nI get where you're coming from here.   Though I would suggest at least distancing yourself from this person, because you can enjoy the benefit of his memories without needing to be close enough that he can have any power over your daily life.\n\n\nHave you thought about making a little journal?  Dot points of memories, things that are brought up?  You could jot down things in a google doc on your phone, or even record conversations when old memories come up.  Often I find that if I sit down and try to recall a time in my life I can only remember Points B and E, but over a few days of musing slowly Points A, C and D will come to me in the shower or something, as long as I don't force it.\n\n\n>then I'd have complete identity loss.\n\n\nI'm not somebody who's ever really struggled with identity, and sometimes I think it's because I've never really *thought* about it -- I've always just kind of gone with the flow.  Which might be a terrible thing to say on a subreddit for people mostly struggling with identity issues, but...it's true XD  I always told people I was British untilIi moved somewhere with a lot of British people, and then I realised I wasn't very British at all! So now I tell people I'm Australian.  It's more true than not, and that's okay with me.\n\n\nI do think, though, that things like heritage and past and labels don't really *matter* for identity -- who you are, as a person, is defined by your choices in life and in the day to day.  I heard somebody once say that 'Your first thought isn't who you are -- that's just your instinct.  But your second thought is your *conscious* reaction, and that's the one that defines you' and I like that.\n\n\nI also think that we grow a lot as we get older.  As a 19 year old, I once stepped off the bus in the rain at night, saw a young man greet his girlfriend off the buss with an umbrella, and though 'I'm such a great girlfriend because I'm not that high maintenance' and then proceeded to walk 15 minutes in the rain to my boyfriend's house, despite my boyfriend having a car.  16 years on and I look back and think 'GURL WHAT WERE YOU DOING YOU DUMBASS'. As a 16 year old I was getting newsletters on 'Defensive Racism' in my inbox and thinking 'oh that makes sense'.  As a 23 year old I had that moment of clarity when I looked back in horror.\n\n\nSo like....I'm missing a lot of memories, yeah.  There are some big stretches of time I don't remember.  There are some really cool events that I don't remember at all, even when I look at pictures and see me definitely in them!  But who I was back then isn't who I am now, and that wouldn't change even if I remembered absolutely everything inbetween.  Do I wish I remembered everything? Absolutely!  It's always so cool to hear stories about the girl I was.  But she's not the girl I am today, and the girl I am today is the one who decides who I'm going to be tomorrow.

Make sure everyone's going into the move with the intent for it to be permanent.\n\n\nEDIT: because I wrote this comment while stressed between work and putting the kids to sleep, and it's been on my mind that I didn't articulate myself well:\n\nYour kids will take their cues from you.  If you're focused on the positives and the benefits and you act confident that the move will work out, they will feel secure in believing that it will work out, too.  You can even sit with your son and work out a list of positives to moving -- e.g., he'll learn another language, no more active shooter drills, you can travel Europe or Africa for vacations, college will be much easier to apply for and much more accessible (it's cheaper, and there's none of that bizarre essay-writing and bazillion extracurriculur in Europe!), maybe you'll be living near a beach or near something else really cool, your son will be able to walk around a lot more than in the states (likely), etc.\n\n\nDefinitely also discuss possible difficulties and solutions so that the kids have a reasonable idea of what to expect (homesickness, culture shock, language difficulties, different food etc.) and feel confident that they will be able to face and overcome them. For example, hey, it might be lonely at first and could be hard to make friends, so let's brainstorm what we're going to do as a family to solve this problem (e.g. joining clubs, attending church/community events, signing up for lessons, etc.).  Let them know that you're going to be doing all you can to spend time with them and put in the work together to ensure they are happy after the move, and follow through.\n\n\nBut I don't think you should tell them 'We're leaving the back door open just in case things don't work out', because that plants the seed in their minds -- dad thinks this might not work out. And then every hurdle, every difficulty faced can become 'proof' that this isn't working out and we should just go home. \n\n\nAs adults we are more rational and can keep it compartmentalized -- 'I am keeping the house in case things don't work out' and 'I sincerely believe things will work out' can both be true at the same time-- but kids and young teens have a lot more trouble with that.

But 'micromanaging' for adhd is very different and about building support and motivation; traditonal micromanaging won't work.\n\n\nDid you research coping strategies and RSD? RSD would explain the lying.\n\n\nShe can probably write the disability office asking for assistance while the diagnosis is pending.\n\n\nPhysical presence is the best type of micromanaging. it can make me work on my worst days, because there's a fear of disappointing others that can't be ignored and put off when someone's sitting behind you. Have her do her work in the kitchen (with headphones if needed), in your office, wherever you hang out for the day. \n\n\nTBH, Daily Check-ins won't do shit when she's this far off the wagon (the consequences aren't immediate enough) and the adhd rut is almost impossible to pull yourself out of without help. \n\n\n(as a grown woman of 34 I've had friends/family call or text me at 10pm to make me start going to bed earlier, because I get into cycles where I sleep less and less despite knowing that lack of sleep is the death knell to adhd, and I *know* I won't go to sleep early myself and I've finally learnt to admit when I need help. I got pissed off at every 10pm reminder but I'd be in bed before 1 (and then before 12...and before 11...) and after a week I no longer needed the reminders.)\n\n\n\nI have a comment I wrote in the twoxadhd sub a while ago with advice on how to get out of a rut with a partner's help.

The executive function, impulse control part of the brain is similar to like a 5 year old?

It's like a long fic about healing via a roadtrip, so the actual 'angst' has already happened and the story's about slowly letting go and learning to look up. It's a very sweet story, gives me that feeling of cuddling up on the sofa against someone you adore and each reading your own books.\n\n\n[Miraculous Coffee](https://archiveofourown.org/series/2460436) is a crack series and like...my favourite thing ever.  It's told from the POV of a coffee shop worker and I'm not normally someone who loves OCs but this one....she's got me.  Basically it's a coffee shop that's frequented by the core four and Hawkmoth, and things get more bizarre from there.  Lots of fun, lots of shipping, will definitely have you feeling great.  (This author has a lot of light, fun fics, though mostly not too long.)\n\n\n[An Arguable Bromance](https://archiveofourown.org/works/36523666/chapters/91080478) is a collection of one-shots centered around Nino and Adrien's friendship.  You'll like it!  (I also really enjoy this author's other works too.)\n\n[When the Morning Comes](https://archiveofourown.org/works/36311089/chapters/90522457#workskin)  Look, I don't know if I'd call this 'fluff', but I've read it so many times.... It's just gorgeous.  After Hawkmoth's defeat, Adrien ends up at Marinette's and in the care of one Tom Dupain.  It starts off with everyone and everything being broken in the aftermath and then, slowly, it gets pulled back together again.  This fic is like a cup of hot chocolate, a cosy blanket and warm fire, and it wraps my heart up in safety and love every time I reread it.  It's my favourite thing, and watching Adrien slowly unfurl and blossom is amazing each time.\n\n\n[A Cat of Their Own](https://archiveofourown.org/works/16915101/chapters/39740721) Marinette's parents find out, and decide to basically adopt Adrien over the phone.  It's lovely to read Ladynoir slowly get closer and Adrien gets some good parental support.\n\n\n[Bakery Enemies AU Comic](https://archiveofourown.org/works/36730066/chapters/91626955) or [on tumblr](https://buggachat.tumblr.com/post/643600496684351488/part-1-this-uber-specific-au-popped-into-my-head)  Adrien never went to public school and Ladybug & Chat Noir never got a reveal but were separated after Hawkmoth's defeat; many years later, Adrien ends up working at the bakery and Marinette has opinions on Hawkmoth's son working in the home of the Guaradian.  Adrien is far too nice for Marinette to keep a vendetta fuelled for long so the title is pretty misleading IMO.  Lots of fun, anyway.  \n\n\nThe comic's author Buggachat also has a new fic up on their page which is long and complete and looks like fun but I haven't read it so I can't rec it.
