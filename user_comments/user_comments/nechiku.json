I've been working on the same thing lately.  I've noticed that the more specialized the vocabulary, the harder it is to acquire it due to the decreased frequency.\n\nWith that in mind, I've found that's it's been helping me to rework my study routine to be hyper focused on a small domain of vocabulary that I want to activate for a period of time.  I concentrate all of my input on that domain, and then funnel it into output practice, and use the output practice to inform my decisions about which input to consume.  By doing this, you can build a virtuous cycle where your output and input build on each other.\n\nAs an example, this might like look like:\n\n* Write a paragraph or do a monologue about the topic you want to talk about.  Take note of any vocabulary or phrases that you can't remember how to express in Japanese.\n* Watch a bunch of Youtube videos (or articles, or movies, or whatever best applies) related to the gaps in your knowledge.  Ask natives how to say the expressions you're missing, or Google them if you can't.\n* After you've immersed a ton in that domain, have some conversations on the same topic, or do more monologuing, etc.  Having a language partner or tutor helps here.\n* Rinse and repeat until you feel like it's sticking.\n\nHopefully this helps!

I believe you'll see much better progress if you make a few improvements:\n\n* Chart out a consistent, daily study routine.  Everyone's lives are different, so no one can tell you what works best or how much time you have to put in.  However, the less time you have, the more focused you have to be to make the most of it.  Language learning is kind of like a bucket with a hole in the bottom; you have to practice consistently, or water will leak out of the bucket as fast as you fill it.  An hour a week is probably not enough time keep the water in the bucket, so to speak.  Try to set aside a \"core\" study hour per day, if possible.  I do this in the morning before work; it's a time when I'll never be interrupted, so even if I have plans or something in evening, I will have studied for at least an hour per day.\n\n* Pick an approach and stick to it.  With a small number of study hours, you have no choice but to be focused, or you'll spin your wheels.  There is no magic beginner material that will help you significantly more than the others, so just pick one.  Genki is all you really need at your level.  JFZ, Duolingo, all of that covers the same material or less, and you don't need them.  Sit down every day and work through Genki (and the workbook).   Use your time with your tutor to practice things from the book, or simple conversations. \n\n* I think the two above points will fix your problem; it did for me when I was stuck in a similar rut after graduating college.  But *if you have additional time* outside of your core study time, try to practice the language.  Read graded readers, listen to Japanese Pod 101 or something.

Some definitions are easier to understand than others.  You can just gradually transition to a better J-J:J-E ratio as your vocabulary increases.

The amount left to learn at that stage is staggering.  But... This is just me musing, but I think the beginner level can *feel* disproportionately difficult to progress through for first-time language learners.  You're learning basically two skills at the same time: how to learn Japanese, and how to learn languages in general.  From that perspective, if you succeed without quitting through N4, or even N5, when the payoffs are the worst and you're still figuring things out, then yes, I think it is quite an achievement.  \n\nIt can feel frustrating because this is a niche community where you will find lots of people who dedicate more time than you to studying.  I am in your exact same situation (working full-time), and your rate of progress is not slow for the time you're putting in, so I wouldn't sweat it.  Learning Japanese was a lot easier when I had fewer responsibilities, or \"had to\" as part of a class while I was a student. Developing the time management skills to make consistent progress in a hobby, instead of vegging out after a stressful day at work, is very important. \n\nPeople often overlook these things when dismissing the lower levels, but I would argue that successful language learning is about developing successful, consistent habits, and the lower levels are where you develop these habits.

I felt so overwhelmed and could barely say anything.  I struggled through the first painful conversation exchange and didn't go back.\n\nAround the same time, I started doing two Italki lessons every week, an hour for each lesson.  For months, it felt like I was making literally no progress with speaking.  It felt unnatural, and was a huge struggle each time.  Despite my teachers being nice and supportive, I dreaded my lessons every week, constantly wondering if I was wasting money, but stuck it out because I had heard so much advice from people on this forum and elsewhere that you have to keep practicing.\n\nAround four months in, it hit me that I felt like I had a *good* day during one of my lessons.  And then the number of \"good\" days slowly started increasing, almost like magic.\n\nRecently, I've starting going back to the language exchange Meetup groups, and was astounded to realized that I feel comfortable talking in Japanese.  I'm absolutely not fluent by any means, probably only lower intermediate.  My speaking is still horribly choppy, mistakes are everywhere, the ocean of unknown vocabulary still feels endless...but I feel like I can express myself more.    Conjugations are feeling more automatic, the grammar I can actually use is growing, and so on... like magic.  Most importantly, Japanese doesn't \"scare\" me anymore, in the fact that I don't draw blanks when speaking as much.\n\nNow granted, I also studied a lot, every day.  And for a few months now, I've put a *huge* focus on listening and shadowing, which has helped noticeably.\n\nI guess to wrap this up, if you can swing it, a paid tutor from Italki can help a lot with getting started and getting comfortable when you first start speaking.  They really can be a lot more helpful than just random native speakers.  They provide you with a treasure tome of corrections each lesson that you can later study and practice.  Plus, I feel like it's a more comfortable environment because I'm paying them to help me, and they're entirely focused on helping me grow.  Also, don't neglect your listening practice!

I would suggest you stick with it and try and find a copy of the workbook, but that being said, heres some things that may help.  \n\nOne thing that helped make the textbook exercises more engaging for me was by using Genki's audio CD for the exercises.  Basically, the CD reads the exercise, prompts you to give an answer, and then says the correct answer.  It gets you actually listening and speaking, you get instant feedback, and feels less tedious than reading through the problems, writing things out, and flipping to the answer.  I believe you can find the audio files floating around on the Internet if you search.\n\nUltimately though, you're learning the language in order to use it, right?  If you're not already, I would also put more of a premium on reading and listening, because seeing grammar in action will help you remember the meaning.  For Genki that means really making sure you understand the dialogues and the reading/writing section in the back of the book, if you're not already doing so.  \n\nYou're getting close to N5 level, so I would start looking for graded readers.

For reading comprehension, not so much, but I've noticed a marked difference when I converse with native speakers; my inability when speaking and writing to actively recall the words I was passively recognizing prompted me to try out production cards.\n\nI've run into two problems with going ENG->JPN though with single words:\n\n1. One English word can map to multiple Japanese words.\n\n2. I might learn the meaning of the word, but I'll have no idea how to use it correctly.  \n\nTo correct this, I started adding context to my cards.  I've found that entire sentences are a bit much for me for flashcards (hard to do i+1), and I often ended up just memorizing the sentence, so lately I've switched to having all of my cards be collocations/short phrases instead. \n\nSo what's a collocation?  In general, it's a sequence of words that frequently go together.  To give a super basic example, I would never study \"shower\" as a single word; I would put \"to take a shower\" on one side, and \u30b7\u30e3\u30ef\u30fc\u3092\u6d74\u3073\u308b on the other.  I do sometimes still study single words, because not everything really needs context, but not usually.\n\nThis helps avoid the problem of having all of your Japanese sentences smell like English.  If I didn't know the collocation, \u30b7\u30e3\u30ef\u30fc\u3092\u6d74\u3073\u308b, I might say \u30b7\u30e3\u30ef\u30fc\u3092\u53d6\u308b instead.  And finally, the vocabulary sticks much better in my head when I have more things to anchor it in my memory.\n\nThese articles go into more depth on the topic: \n\nhttp://www.nihongonobaka.com/stop-studying-sentences-and-start-studying-collocations/\n\nhttps://dayjaby.wordpress.com/2015/10/21/broaden-and-deepen-your-vocabulary/\n\nI know I've conflated this into two topics, and maybe collocations on a recognition card would be just fine.  I offer this as a way to gain the benefits of production cards while minimizing some of the common issues with them.  In short, if done right, I think that production cards can be really helpful.\n\nAs for recognition cards, I still think they're very important.  Since I don't use production cards to test being able to write kanji compounds, I use recognition cards as a tool to develop literacy in the language; I have to remember how to read kanji compounds somehow.  Reading helps a lot, but for those kanji compounds that just won't stick, recognition cards are perfect.\n\ntl;dr - Both kinds of cards can be helpful, but each has pitfalls.

As mentioned before, keep it up.  You will eventually feel the improvement.\n2. If you're tripping over any particular conjugation or phrases, try drilling them on your own.  This has helped me a lot with passive, causative, and causative-passive form, which were the hardest things in Genki 2 for me to physically speak correctly. \n3. Learn phrases that help you discern unknown things like, \"What does X mean?\" or \"What's the difference between X and Y?\" and so on.  By knowing these, even if you run into unknown vocabulary, you can keep the conversation in Japanese.\n4.
