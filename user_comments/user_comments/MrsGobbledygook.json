I travel to Sweden A LOT so you're at the right adress ;)\n\nIf you have a week and a half i'd reccomend to visit some museums in Stockholm (there's a bunch! So whatever interests you, you'll find it!). One of my personal favourites is \"stadsmuseet\" at Slussen, a museum about the history of Stockholm. Another one of my favourites is \"teatertekniska museet\" a theatre museum. The third floor almost made me miss my flight. Going to Vasa Museet is also worth it (this huge ass ship that sunk and got digged up 333years later, almost completely preserved! WILD)\n\nA lot of museums are free aswell (vasa is not).\n\nAlso wander around gamla stan. It's my ritual of the first hours in Stockholm haha. (After visiting a friend who works close by haha)\n\nI'd personally take a boat out in to the archipelago in that time frame. It's so nice and quiet out there. You can wander off. I personally loved Svarts\u00f6, but don't have many experiences on other islands (there's over 35k, so...)\n\nIf you want to go a bit more out of Stockholm it's also nice to go to Gotland (ferry leaves around 60km south of Stockholm, the boatride will take you around 3hrs - 3,5hrs.) But it's a lovely island, also the biggest in the baltic sea. Also Pippi Longstockings got recorded here and you can visit her original house from the 60s series.\n\nI don't know if you want to cross off as many places as possible or just take your time and travel a bit more slowly. I'm a slow traveller and I feel like it's nice to stay at the same place for a few days instead of constantly carrying around your luggage.\n\nIf you have any questions or need help finding transport, other questions, feel free to DM.
