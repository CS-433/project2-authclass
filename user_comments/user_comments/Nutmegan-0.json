I\u2019ve only learned Spanish for three years, but it was enough time to gain a semi-fluency. You still have time!! \n2) Pay for the majority of the regions is \u20ac700/month.

While this doesn\u2019t seem like much, the cost of living (especially in Andaluc\u00eda - the south- where the majority of placements are) is much lower. You can easily find an apartment to yourself for \u20ac400 in the smaller towns. Auxes are expected to work 12 hours/week (16 in Madrid). There may be some prep work outside of the classroom, but this is a stellar deal for the pay. Many people receive one day a week off (for example, I\u2019ll be splitting my 12 hours between 2 school- 3 hours per day. I\u2019ll have Friday\u2019s off for a 3-day weekend!!). \n3) When applying, you list your top 3 preferred regions.

I was placed in a coastal city about an hour away from both Malaga and Granada! \n4) You\u2019ll have to check the many blogs regarding qualifications but the two I\u2019m sure about are that you are required to be a native English speaker, and you need to have a Bachelor\u2019s degree...\n\nThis program is an amazing opportunity if you go into with an open mind!
