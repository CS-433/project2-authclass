No doubt many people will swoop in to say where the analogy is wrong!\n\nAn index tracker is essentially loads of people pooling their money together (the fund) and allocating that pool proportionally over shares in a particular market in order to get that market average (the index). \n\n---------------------------\n**An extreme ELI5**: Say the stock market is one hundred people (the businesses) all playing double or nothing by tossing a coin (taking business risks and decisions) once a month. Certain people will win (share value goes up) others lose (share value goes down). You have \u00a3100 you want to gamble with (invest). What can you do?\n\nThe \"traditional\" way of investing here would be to try to (or hire someone to) identify a few gamblers who are playing well and whom you predict will win in the future (promising companies) so you give them your \u00a3100 and hope for the best. If you give it to one gambler, there's 50% chance you'll lose all your money that month.\n\nThe index fund route would be to give each person \u00a31. You know you won't win stupid amounts of money, but whatever happens to those one hundred coin tosses, you'll get the average return of the room (the room's \"index\"). The probability of everyone in the room losing the coin toss is minimal (likewise everyone winning). Over the months, roughly half your money will vanish and the other half will double, leaving you to fluctuate around the average (the index) with some variance.\n\nThe key idea now is that over long periods of time, the economy actually tends to only go upwards (wealth is produced). This is like people playing with more favourable odds. Say, rolling 1-4 = double, 5 or 6 = zero. Then over the months roughly two thirds your dosh will double, and the other third will vanish. Over many months your return tracks the room index, around 20% growth. Much better than the 2/3 chance of just a single player.\n\nIn other words you buy up everything and get the aggregate effect. What Buffet is saying is that you'll be hard pressed to identify good dice throwers consistently and beat what you would normally get over the long term just by tracking the average.\n\n...\n\nNow, in the real world you need to make a lot of tweaks to this analogy. Some players will be rich and will be using their large capital in low risk games to make smallish returns (e.g. Google and Amazon), while other poorer plays will be risking their small life's worth hoping to quadruple their wealth in riskier games (e.g. a Kenyan farmer buying a tractor). You'll also need to split your monthly \u00a3100 proportionally among all the player depending on their stakes (the market share) to get a proper average.\n\nVanguard is one company offering many individual funds to cover each of these separate indices (big players, small and risky, etc). They also offer \"funds of funds\" like the Life Strategy which aim to divvy your monthly \u00a3100 among the index funds proportionally, to try to cover as much of the world average as possible (e.g. big chunk to the big players, little chunk to the smaller, riskier gamblers).\n\n...\n\nThe big idea is that once you're tracking an index you're quite cleverly removing as much of the gambling element as possible from investing in that market. Buffet is actually an anomaly in this case, as he seems to have made his fortune from being able to correctly pick good coin tossers and dice throwers, whether by luck or intuition. Even he came round to championing index tracking. Index tracking, or \"passive investing\" has met a lot of opposition since its inception. People have even called it \"communist\" back when that was the bad word, I suppose because it can be viewed as quite parasitic just tracking the market average and making returns off the risk of others. That's nonsense of course because you're still investing in the economy - you're just throwing out big gains and big losses in favour of a smoother, more modest return. \n\nA lot more caveats to it, but I think that's a basic enough explanation of the strategy.

Well, there are some twenty other languages, most of them small and spoken in northwest Russia, that form a bridge over the abyss that separates Hungarian and Finnish. The word for \u2018five\u2019, for instance, takes on forms such as viit (in Estonian), vit (Komi), wet (Khanty) and \u00e4t (Mansi), a sequence that neatly joins the Finnish viisi to the Hungarian \u00f6t.\n\n>And vocabulary is of course just one aspect of language. When it comes to phonology (the sounds of a language) and grammar, the kinship of Hungarian and Finnish is easier to see. In terms of sounds, both have a large set of vowels, which is exceptional in itself. More tellingly, among these vowels are two that English and most other languages don\u2019t have \u2013 they are equivalent to eu and u in French, or \u00f6 and \u00fc in German. What\u2019s more, both languages divide their vowels into two sets, and all vowels within each individual word have to belong to the same set. Finally, all words are stressed on the first syllable.\n\n> Finnish and Hungarian also share at least six grammatical features that are rare in Europe. Both of them ignore gender to the point where they have only one word for \u2018he\u2019 and \u2018she\u2019 (h\u00e4n in Finnish, \u0151 in Hungarian). Both have more than twelve cases. Both have postpositions rather than prepositions. Both have a great love of suffixes \u2013 a word along the lines of establishmentarianistically, consisting mostly of suffixes, wouldn\u2019t raise an eyebrow. Possession is expressed not with a verb but with a suffix; instead of saying \u2018I have it\u2019, they say something that could be rendered in English as \u2018it is on me\u2019. And finally, numerals are always followed by a singular (\u2018six dog\u2019 rather then \u2018six dogs\u2019); if the number has been made explicit, why go to the extra trouble of modifying what follows?\n\nFrom Gaston Dorren's book *Lingo*. \n\n", "created_utc": "1471169904.0", "edited": "False", "id": "d6gx7t0", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_4xjbl0", "parent_id": "t1_d6gaz61", "score": "1", "subreddit": "history", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh53"}, {"author": "drift_glass", "body": "It can be enough to contradict someone's story.

They formed kingships of their own but were suffering invasions on the west of the island from the Scots (at that point s tribe from Ireland) and the Picts from the north. The warlord leader of Britain, Vortigern, apparently hired the Angles, Saxons and Jutes (essentially raiders at that time) as mercenaries to help fight them but they ended up invading and taking the country for themselves. These events are mainly documented by Gildas (from a Romano-Celt perspective) and Bede (from a later Anglo-Saxon perspective). \n\nAfter that 'England' existed as various kingdoms (at one times known as the Heptarchy) with practically no influence of native Celtic culture except in place names. The Celtic population was reduced to small pockets in the west/small islands. Parts of Wales would exercise some degree of independent rule for a few centuries yet and cause trouble for the English. \n\nIn the 600s the country was mostly 're-Christianised' and clerical Latin was introduced. \n\nAfter this the country was unified into one Anglo-Saxon kingdom but soon began having troubles with the Danes who first raided and then occupied northern England. This period of struggle gave birth to Arthurian legend. The Danelaw had a sizeable impression on English and to this day the language shares many attributes with the Scandinavian tongues. \n\nScotland by this time saw the displacement of the Picts by the Scoti (Scots) from Ireland. Ireland itself had been Christianised long before (by mid 400s) and was ruled by a few warring chiefdoms. \n\nThe rest of the history of the island was to be shaped by the emerging relations between the Anglo-Saxons (English speaking), Danes (Old Norse speaking) and Normans (Germanic people but French speaking) in the 10th and 11th centuries. The row over the English crown would lead to the Norman invasion.

Your questions are all completely understandable.\n\nThere's no official way to write Persian in Latin script, but there are some standard ways that I'll use for clarity, but you can write however you like.\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n>\"ash\" (like \"sag-ash\") ... \"shon\" (like \"sandovich-shon\") ... \"hoyashon\" (like \"seeb-hoyashon\")\n\n*-ash* and *-ash\u0101n* in grammar are genitive case markers. They indicate someone's possession of the noun, in this case the 3rd person. Hence: *sagash* = \"her/his/its dog\". Adding *-\u0101n* to the marker makes it plural. Hence: *sandevichash\u0101n* = \"their sandwich\".\n\nThe plural form (with some exceptions) is formed by adding *-h\u0101* to the word. So what you're seeing there is *sibh\u0101yash\u0101n* (seeb-hoyashon) = \"their apples\" (the vowels sounds are linked by a *y* here).\n\n[Note: In colloquial/spoken Persian these are usually pronounced *-esh* and *-eshun*. Unless after a vowel *-h\u0101* is just pronounced *-\u0101*. E.g. *sib\u0101shun* = \"their apples\".]\n\n---------------------------------------\n\nYou are correct about *d\u0101rad*. It is a conjugation of the verb *d\u0101shtan* \"to have\", but when it appears before another verb it makes the present continuous \"-ing\" tense. Think of how in English we would say \"I have eaten\". The word *have* there is grammatical and not literal. Persian belongs to the same language family as most of the languages of Europe so that's probably why we share this auxiliary 'have' verb.\n\nSo it's *in mard d\u0101rad ket\u0101bash r\u0101 mikh\u0101nad* = \"this man is reading his book\". In other cases you will need to conjugate it appropriately. Thus: *man d\u0101ram mikh\u0101nam* = \"I'm reading\".\n\n[Note: In colloquial Persian the *-ad* verb suffix is *-e*. Thus: *d\u0101rad--->d\u0101re*, *mikh\u0101nad-->mikhune*.]\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n> Is this saying \"this baby is mine,\" or \"this is my baby\"?\n\nIn English these are the same thing pretty much so it doesn't matter which way you translate it. Literally it says \"this my-baby is\", because there's not really a naturally way to say \"this baby is mine\" in Persian. It would be something like *in kudak m\u0101le man ast* (\"this baby is my property) but I think that's pretty dodgy.\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n>Does \"ma\" mean \"we\" and \"our\"?\n\n*m\u0101* mean \"we/us\". Where the confusion for this and the previous question might be coming from is that you have to look out for something called an ez\u0101fe. This is the *-e* (or as you write *-a*) at the end of a noun that indicates it is owned by the thing that comes after it. So *kudake man* is actually *kudak-e man* = ~ \"baby of me\". In English, \"of me\" or \"of us\" would be \"mine\", \"ours\", etc. \n\nSo while in Persian there are no direct words for *mine* or *our* etc, the construction *X-e man* and *Y-e m\u0101* = \"my X\" and \"our Y\". Just look out for the *-e* that's not part of the actual word. Here the word is *kudak* not *kudak-e*. With this in mind the previous question/answer should make more sense!\n\nThese possessive forms can be shortened further. For example the *-ash* thing from earlier is, I think, basically a shortening of *-e ishun*, where *ishun* is an archaic version of *u* = him/her/it. This is getting long so I'll stop here!\n\nI hope all this made sense. Feel free to ask for clarifications or followups. These questions are all natural things to ask and you sound like you're on the right track.\n\n-------------------------------------\n\n**Edit:** a good reference and overview of the things I've discussed can be found on [this wiki page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persian_grammar#Possessive_determiners).

(So English when we say \"at the moment I'm working for this company\" that will just be mapped to *kaar mikonam* because it's just an English habit to phrase it that way. If you're working right at that moment that someone's talking to you, it's *daaram kaar mikonam*.)\n\n* There's no separate future tense in spoken Farsi. You just use the present form and qualify it by adding something like 'tomorrow'. The grammatical future tense *khaaham kard* is never used in conversational language and you'll sound incredibly weird if you apply it to an everyday scenario like watching TV. Just stay away from that. \n\n* in order to use the *konam* form you must trigger it with an explicit or implied condition. With this verb mood you are not watching TV but the idea of watching TV is there (think how the verb changes in English when you say \"I would watch TV\" or \"if I were to watch TV\" - in neither case are you watching TV but there's an implied condition to you doing so). This is what the *be-* verb mood is in farsi and it all the English cases map to just that form in Farsi.
