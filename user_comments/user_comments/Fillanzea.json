Cameron's not great at taking care of his living space or himself. Depression, poverty, and drug use seem to play a role in that, but I get the feeling that we're still missing part of the story. Cameron wakes up, makes coffee, and ruminates on his own loathing for himself and his situation. Fergus comes downstairs to talk to Cameron. Both Fergus and Cameron are in the city's literary scene but neither seems to be very well-connected. (I found myself wanting more details here about the literary scene, what their social circles look like - it's a little bit vague to me.)  Fergus evicts Cameron, and Cameron (unsuccessfully, it looks like) tries to negotiate the eviction. Cameron says that he only needs a few hundred dollars more to afford a plane ticket, a detail we don't get any follow-up on, but one that suggests he might be a very long way from home and parents who might take him in. Cameron's lack of other places to go suggests that he doesn't have a lot of friends, and he's burned bridges with people over his unreliability or his drug use. Cameron is bruised and someone has carved into his skin, but we don't know why. \n\nWhat's coming through vividly for me here is the squalor of Cameron's life. He hasn't entirely given up on himself - he does have this conviction that he's not where he's meant to be - but to a very great extent he either doesn't care or doesn't have the (physical? emotional? cognitive?) capacity to do anything about the grime and the cockroaches and the cigarette butts. I get the impression of someone (in his early-to-mid-twenties?) who's always had someone to pick up after him and never learned to do it for himself. The physical details of the space and of Cameron's body and Fergus's body are well-observed and well-rendered. In terms of larger story-level things, I like that we see Cameron going from a bad situation to an even worse one - eviction, potential homelessness. The impression I get of Cameron from the beginning of this chapter is that he's not going to change unless something forces him to change, so as soon as Fergus states his intention to evict Cameron, I know it's not just going to be a sad-sack-ruminating story - he's going to have to do SOMETHING to get out of trouble. \n\nThe biggest thing that isn't working for me here is how the chapter deals with Cameron's thoughts and feelings. \n\n>More than he \u2018thought\u2019 these expressions, he felt them in a deep and fundamental sense. They were abscesses on his heart; he had reluctantly observed their swelling for months \u2013 years if he were to stop and ascribe thought to it \u2013 and they now twinged and ached and threatened to burst. \n\nThis is vague, abstract language. I almost kind of want to like it - the use of the word 'abcesses' especially - but fundamentally, it distances me as a reader from Cameron. \n\nIn the piece as a whole, we're kept at arm's length from Cameron, in terms of the psychic distance of the point of view. (This is especially evident in the first sentence, where Cameron is just \"the man.\") It's nominally written in close third person, but actually, it feels like a very clinical, distant kind of third person, plus a little bit of interjected internal monologue. And I don't think that works. \n\nI do think that the writing here is most effective when we get concrete nouns and verbs and least effective when we're hearing about what Cameron's thoughts and feelings are doing. And actually, there's still a lot of effective stuff in the first section as Cameron wakes up, makes coffee, observes the physical space around him, but I think that if you cut out all the internal monologue the sense of despair would still come through just as well. That doesn't mean I think you shouldn't have any internal monologue, but you might think about approaching it differently. \n\n>Worse yet, he became struck with a near physical revulsion when he regarded the hands gripping the stove edge, the cracked, red skin between their knuckles, the yellow, tobacco-stained fingers, the untrimmed, dirt-filled nails.\r  \n\n\n\"he became struck with a near physical revulsion\" is abstract language, it's language that puts us outside Cameron's body and brain. I'm not sure if the abstraction and distancing is a conscious choice on your part or not, but...I want to read a version of this chapter that brings us in closer. \n\nAlong the same lines, don't be afraid of internal monologue where it actually tells us something useful! I'm not saying we need to know right now why Cameron's body is bruised and carved, or why he wants a plane ticket (does he, in fact, want a plane ticket?) or all of the backstory that brought him to this moment, but there's a bit of a weird juxtaposition of how concrete and distant and \"camera's-eye\" the majority of the narration is, and then these moments of very close (but still very abstracted!) focus on his feelings. \n\nI'm not sure if you have read either of these, but John Gardner's *The Art of Fiction* has some helpful stuff about psychic distance, and Robert Olen Butler's *From Where You Dream* has some extremely helpful stuff about expressing emotion through concrete detail. \n\nSome stylistic stuff you might want to look at: the overuse of participle phrases.\n\n>The lighter clicked in Cameron\u2019s hands several times, *failing to produce a flame*. *Tutting*, he tossed it onto the table, forced himself upright, and unsteadily made his way to the kitchen. *Turning on the stove*, he bent over, *puckering* *his lips* to push the cigarette as far from his face and as close to the flame as possible. \n\nThere's nothing wrong with participle phrases (although they can be confusing when it's not clear what the subject is), but the \"ing\"s can get echoey, and they can cram a lot of different actions into a sentence in a way that can feel awkward and confusing. \n\nWatch out for vague and abstract language.", "created_utc": "1666532450.0", "edited": "False", "id": "itgf7n7", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_ybg7k5", "parent_id": "t3_ybg7k5", "score": "9", "subreddit": "DestructiveReaders", "subreddit_id": "t5_2z15u"}, {"author": "Fillanzea", "body": "Other people have mentioned that your word count is a *lot* too long for YA.

Anneliese's name was at the top, as it had been for the last six years.\n\nOn one hand, I do think that the visual description that you have in your first 300 words is quite effective at sketching out the military academy as a place of harsh whites and blacks, where perfection is demanded and ambiguity is not tolerated. But I do question whether you could pull back on this a little bit and still have it come through just as effectively. And I question whether this scene in particular is the right place to start. There's not really an element of surprise to Annaliese seeing her name at the top of the ranks (it's just like the last six years) and there's not an element of stakes either (would her offer to the Praetorian Guard have been rescinded if she'd placed 2nd or 3rd? Doesn't matter anyway, because she's 1st again). It's not a scene that puts her in conflict with another person or with the school's rigidity. And I guess that's part of the point - she excels at fitting into this school's systems and rules.\n\nAnneliese finds out that she's first in the class rankings again (which is expected, and it's not clear why it would be important if she wasn't first). Then she looks at the envelope that contains her offer to the Praetorian Guard (which is not new information to her, and we as readers don't understand the import of this yet.) I know this is just the first 300 words, but even in the first 300 words I want more to develop the plot, more to surprise Annaliese (or us as readers), more beyond static description.

Children are affected by changing family dynamics (absence of one parent in the home, divorce, remarriage, parental death). They are affected by different kinds of abuse, often from their parents or trusted adults. They are affected by parental incarceration. Children are first- and second-generation immigrants who may be called in to translate for their parents.\n\nSo for the most part I don't think of it in terms of being honest to children about the state of the world. I think of it in terms of creating space for the realities of all those lived experiences, and not treating it as something to be kept secret or swept under the rug if Bobby's dad is in prison or Sarah's living with foster parents.\n\nI certainly think that social studies classes should incorporate a basic level of current events knowledge that's necessary for being a well-rounded human being and well-informed citizen, at a level that's age appropriate.\n\nI also think about my own childhood - my school didn't do a ton of current events stuff.

She doesn't even have that much power in deciding what to acquire and what not to acquire.\n\nMost of the people with real power in the publishing industry are *not* \"woke ladies,\" and it is hard to think of times when \"woke ladies\" have exerted any real power on what the publishing industry did. (I can only think of when Hachette employees walked out over the publication of Woody Allen's memoir, and it ended up having to find a different publisher). The mainstream publishing industry publishes Evangelical books and right-wing books all the time. \n\nTo the degree that \"woke ladies\" have much power in the publishing industry, I think it's principally because so much of the audience for middlebrow literary fiction is now made up of - well - \"white women from a certain background and sensibility.\" I think this has something to do with economics and the disappearance of the mass-market paperback from supermarket shelves, and something to do with Oprah's Book Club, and perhaps a *lot* to do with the fact that book clubs are very gendered.

Because the publishing industry has always been primarily for people with money, although it feels like books were way more accessible in the mid-20th-century when the pulps were still a thing. And it does feel to me - in a very subjective way - that publishers took more chances then. But it was also way more male-dominated. And I think that what looks like the pernicious influence of \"woke ladies\" is... actually exactly the same reason all movies today feel the same: the people who have the power to make major financial decisions don't want to take a chance on anything whose success can't be guaranteed by profit & loss spreadsheets. \n\n(Full disclosure: I am both a \"woke lady\" (with an asterisk because I may be a woman but I am *not* a \"lady\") and a \"white woman from a certain background and sensibility.\")", "created_utc": "1665852708.0", "edited": "False", "id": "isfntab", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_y4pwjk", "parent_id": "t1_isfiy6b", "score": "27", "subreddit": "PubTips", "subreddit_id": "t5_3h5w8"}, {"author": "Fillanzea", "body": ">If they really wanted to uplift minority voices, they\u2019d diversify their hiring practices and hire black female editors, Hispanic dudes, old Asian ladies, and other actual \u201cmarginalized\u201d people. \n\nSo why isn't he talking about the elephant in the room here? \n\nEditors are, almost uniformly, *people who can afford to live in New York on a $45k - 50k salary* because they are being supported by their families or partners.

And at that point, of course you're talking about mostly people from upper-middle-class white families.

Young children, when they're learning their native language, go through a period where they make tons of mistakes with irregular verbs - they say \"I holded the rabbit\" instead of \"I held the rabbit\" and that kind of thing - and they grow out of it *whether they are corrected or not*, because they spend enough time hearing other people say \"I held the rabbit\" or \"I ran\" or whatever. They're not developing bad habits - they're just still learning. Adult learners of second languages definitely *do* have fossilized grammar mistakes, even when they're otherwise quite advanced, but is that because of early output, or is that because of something else? If we make mistakes in our output, does that get better with conscious correction or not? What about mistakes where we know the right way to say it, and we get it right in writing because we have more time to think about our mistakes, but we make mistakes in speaking because there's less time to think about the right way to phrase something? (It is VERY common for advanced-level second-language-learners to have fossilized grammar mistakes where they do fine in writing, do fine on a test, but make mistakes in conversations when they don't have time to think.) \n\nI think that having a tutor can be really useful even as a beginner, because a tutor can have a conversation with you that's at your level. They can slow down, repeat things, rephrase things, define words you don't know. They can have a conversation with you that's specific to the vocabulary you need. (When I had more need for professional Spanish, I really wish I had hired a tutor to practice library-specific conversations, like how to say \"The romance books are over there,\" or \"You have a fine of 13.22,\" or \"I'll place a request for the book you want and it should come in next week.\") I think it makes sense not to try to force output too early, but at the same time - waiting until you already know the 'right' way to say things can be a liability (when you need to use the language right away for work or travel), and it can sometimes build up a barrier of anxiety that gets in your way when you actually want to use the language. At some point you need to start having conversations, and having a tutor can really help in terms of building up the confidence to have conversations in a low-stakes environment.", "created_utc": "1665417715.0", "edited": "False", "id": "irrwu6o", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_y0higy", "parent_id": "t3_y0higy", "score": "12", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "Fillanzea", "body": "I would encourage you to read Stephen Krashen's free book, [Principles and Practice of Second Language Acquisition](http://www.sdkrashen.com/content/books/principles_and_practice.pdf), which is (in my opinion) the best explanation of the idea that languages are acquired through comprehensible input. Because I think that your assumptions are not necessarily correct. \n\nI think that even language study that's focused on comprehensible input does indeed take conscious effort! At least insofar as it takes substantially more conscious effort for me to read five pages of a book in Spanish or Japanese than to read five pages of a book in English. I will spend several hours reading Twitter and Reddit in English without putting in any conscious effort at all, and I can't do that in Spanish or Japanese even after years of study and quite a lot of comprehensible input. I think proponents of comprehensible input would only say that you can't acquire language through drilling or memorizing grammar patterns. \n\n(Here we have to emphasize that there's a distinction between learning and acquisition. One of the important insights of comprehensible input, I think, is understanding that speaking a language at a high proficiency level requires a mental model of the grammar of a language that lets us have subconscious knowledge of what sounds right and what doesn't sound right.) \n\nWhat I believe based on my reading of Krashen and others is that traditional study is totally fine for at least some people. We have a bit of an unusual sample size on /r/languagelearning because a lot of us are nerds who'll spend 30 minutes or an hour per day on Anki memorizing vocabulary. Those are the people who traditional study works fine for. (Although even with those people, sometimes they learn 3000 words of vocabulary and try to start reading Japanese and then they realize they don't understand anything about verb conjugation or sentence structure.) The problem is - what are you going to do about those *other* folks, the other 85% of a high school Spanish classroom, who aren't motivated to put in that kind of work? And Krashen's hypothesis is that if you can get those kids reading and listening to and understanding real language right away, and skip over (as much as possible) all the \"yo fui, tu fuiste, el fue, ella fue, nosotros fuimos, ustedes fueron\" drilling, they will acquire more language (and stay more engaged too.) \n\n(Even if you want to start a revolution, though, I think you should be doing a LOT of comprehensible input. Just do more of it. And - the better you get at the language, the more advanced your comprehensible input should become. It's not just Dreaming in Spanish forever. At some point, start reading some Latin American Marxist novelists, start reading left-wing theory in Spanish, start reading economic theory in Spanish.

They're just *fine*. You have to rise above fine, not with every aspect of your writing, but at least with one or two. \n\nIn terms of fatal flaws... there are books that get published despite having huge plot holes, wooden characters, clumsy prose, tedious infodumps. It's possible to overcome big flaws if the rest of your manuscript is compelling enough. I think the big places to look are pacing, structure, and set-up/pay-off. Are there places where the tension drops to zero? Does the plot wander and meander or is it purposeful? Are we being told things without having any idea why we're being told them? When an emotional issue gets introduced, does it get resolved in a satisfying way, or does it lurch off-screen to die? \n\nThere are two books that did the most for me to push my writing from \"almost there\" to \"publishable.\" I don't know if they're great books or if I just found them at the right time in my development. But I think there are a lot of people who could stand to learn their lessons.\n\nFrom Where You Dream, by Robert Olen Butler - Many writers who are otherwise very good aren't very good at managing character emotion/motivation. Either we get a lot of internal monologue, or we just get surfaces and actions with none of the emotion/motivation. Butler's model is to lean heavily on specific sensory detail and keeping the reader firmly in the scene and using those specific sensory details to imply and suggest emotion. Butler is definitely a literary fiction writer, but even if you're not, I think it can be really helpful to look at your writing from that perspective, of nailing down sensory details and letting the emotions emerge from that. \n\nAbout Writing, by Samuel Delany - This is the book that hammered into my head that *style is not the frosting on top of the plot-and-structure cake. Style is the whole cake!* \n\nAnd that doesn't mean that your style has to be ornate or experimental or draw attention to itself. It just means that no matter how cool the characters and plot twists and set pieces are inside your head, the *only* way your readers are going to experience those characters and plot twists and set pieces is through your words. 26 letters, some numbers, and some punctuation marks. That's all you get. You get to manipulate exactly what information the reader gets, and in what order, and you get to manipulate some emotional stuff through sentence rhythm, prosody, etc. Delany isn't prescriptive about style, but he's insistent that you pay attention to exactly what your words and sentences are doing. \n\nOnce I started paying attention to what my words and sentences were doing, I was a lot closer to writing publishable fiction.", "created_utc": "1663708948.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ip8xq0d", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_xjje0m", "parent_id": "t3_xjje0m", "score": "60", "subreddit": "PubTips", "subreddit_id": "t5_3h5w8"}, {"author": "Fillanzea", "body": "There's literally no reason they couldn't give you a contract that says \"This agreement can be terminated at any time by either party\" if they want you to be able to back out at any time if you want to.

Get Sophy involved right away in meaningful action. One obvious way to do it is to skip right to where she meets Nico; another way might be to have her run into some kind of emotionally charged action on campus (given her interest in human rights, I'm thinking something like a protest or a petition, but it could even be something like running into a student who reminds her of herself when she was younger, or who seems like the complete opposite of who she was when she was younger.)

When I started just doing enough Duolingo to keep my streak going - and I wasn't doing other stuff in Spanish - that fell off *completely*. Duolingo has good reasons for trying to get you to do three minutes a day to keep your streak going, but the result is that you feel like you're making progress when you're just treading water. \n* Duolingo is very bad when it comes to getting you to speak in the language. You cannot practice having a conversation. You are never asked to come up with a spontaneous answer to \"what did you do last weekend?\" or \"what do you do for work?\" because it is impossible for an app to do that, and it will be for a while, barring massive improvements in AI. I think that this is fine when you're a beginner - I don't think it's a bad thing to get a feel for the language through input and translation before you're forced to produce your own spontaneous language - but by the time you're learning the imperfect subjunctive, you should know how to have a conversation! \n* You're also missing out on a lot of cultural norms around how people have conversations. With Japanese, for example, you need to know a LOT about politeness and social rules, and Duolingo doesn't do a great job with that. \n* Duolingo seems to try its best not to explicitly teach grammar any more than absolutely necessary, and I think that's actually a good principle, but often they get the balance wrong. In Japanese, for example, there are basically three ways to say \"is\": desu is for describing something (my mother *is* a doctor, the car *is* red). imasu and arimasu are for something existing in a location, imasu for people and animals and arimasu for objects (there *is* a drugstore on the corner, the cup *is* on the table.) Ever since the Duolingo Japanese course started, /r/learnjapanese has been a little bit overrun with people being really confused about the differences between desu, imasu, and arimasu. I understand it's a hard thing to get your head around if you're coming from an English background, but I think there are real problems with how Duolingo tries to teach these differences. \n\n(The problem with trying to teach grammar implicitly rather than explicitly is that you need a LOT of input, especially when the grammar is so different from the student's native language, and I suspect that input needs to be richer than what Duolingo can provide. Duolingo's bank of sentences is relatively small, and the amount of language it exposes you to is also relatively small.) \n\nI don't hate Duolingo. I think it can be a pretty good supplement, and it may be the best option out there for a few people who are really limited in their ability to pay for classes or get access to other learning resources.

If I say \"tall people make better rulers\" and you say \"wise people make better rulers,\" how do we decide who wins out? \n\nIf we can come up with good criteria to decide which people are better suited to be rulers, how can we measure based on those criteria? Even if you and I can agree that intelligence is an important criterion, and we decide to give everybody an IQ test, how can we make sure that test is actually measuring what we want to measure, and not just our own prejudices and cultural biases? \n\nWhen we're dealing with the real world, those answers always end up being decided by the people who are already in power. So all of these ideas about some people being better suited to ruling are just power trying to justify itself. Since there is no objective standard by which we can measure who's best suited to rule, those standards always end up being set by the people who already have power and want to hold onto power. (Literacy tests in the Jim Crow south are a good example of this. They did not measure intelligence or literacy or anything like that. They were purely a device that let the ruling class *pretend* they had a fair system.) \n\nThe reason it's hard to critique the idea of people being \"gold\" or \"bronze\" or whatever is that it's not something you can disprove by observation. You cannot appeal to evidence. Thomas Jefferson (while owning slaves, of course...) had to say \"We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights\" because... you can't prove it; you just have to accept it as an axiom. But I would also say, even if we were to say that certain people are \"gold\" or \"bronze,\" it doesn't follow that they should be granted special rights based on that status. If you're really good at killing people, that doesn't mean you should have the right to kill people. If you're really good at bossing people around, that doesn't mean you should have the right to boss people around.

(The example I best remember from that book is that a tree plantation looks more efficient to an outside expert than a natural mixed-growth forest, but the natural mixed-growth forest provides a lot of benefits that don't even get noticed: biodiversity is a protection against disease, diverse forests provide more habitats for wildlife, diverse forests provide food and firewood to local residents who depend on foraging for their food supply.) \n\nSo many public policy solutions proposed by people who were well-educated and well-meaning proved to be absolutely disastrous in implementation, from Prohibition to the War On Some Drugs to eugenics (which was a VERY popular progressive policy position about a hundred years ago.) \n\nThis is not to disparage the value of expertise.

This is because\n2. A rejection letter does not mean that your writing is \"bad,\" and an acceptance letter does not mean that your writing is \"good.\" Some editors have crap taste. Some editors have excellent taste, but they just bought a story about a haunted refrigerator, so your story about a haunted ice-cream maker is just too similar for them to publish. There are a million reasons for a piece to get rejected beyond it being \"good\" or \"bad\" in a simplistic binary way. \n3. While we're here, remember that we can't measure objectively how \"good\" or \"bad\" writing is. And even if we could, that wouldn't be the reason most publication decisions get made. Publishers want to buy things their readers will want to read. \n4. Okay, you could define \"good writing\" in a boring way to just mean \"whatever readers want to read,\" but no thank you, that's boring!\n5. So, if you get rejected, what that probably means is: you wrote something that didn't fit the editor's perception of what their market wants to read. That's not a reflection on you as a person or your skills as a writer. \n6. Okay: some books are rejected because they're bad. A lot of books are rejected because they're bad.

To you, your writing might feel like a piece of your heart, but to the publishing industry, your writing is a product they want to sell to readers. And publishing will eat you up if you cannot build a wall between the part of you that thinks \"this is a book that came out of my heart\" and the part of you that has to sell that book to an editor. It is much easier to deal with the thought \"Man, it's hard to sell an urban fantasy queer romance about Quebec language politics\" than the thought \"I wrote a bad book.\" \n8. And truly: I don't think it's ever helpful to think \"I wrote a bad book.\" You might read it and think, \"I want to sharpen Marius's characterization,\" or \"I want to make the city's atmosphere come through more clearly,\" but just classifying your writing as \"good\" or \"bad\" doesn't give you any direction to go in. \n9. Okay: you might write a bad book. So? You might cook a bad meal. You might build a bad birdhouse. Normally I'm quite a good cook, but last week I oversalted my onions. No big deal.

However, a lot of the innovative African-American musicians saw very little money from their work, because of radio segregation and predatory contracts. White producers and musicians got rich adapting rock and roll into something that was marketable to the mainstream white audience. \n* Or, an example that's pertinent to your question: a white restaurateur opens an \"Asian fusion\" cuisine restaurant and presents their cooking as something new and hip and trendy, while the same respect is not accorded to Vietnamese people cooking more traditional Vietnamese food or Chinese people cooking more traditional Chinese food.\n\nSo I think when there's cultural influence and mixing, you have to be sensitive to how power and money and racism are working in that particular situation.

That's very reasonable. It was her misfortune to be friends with people who were just a *little bit* better off than she was. And unless you're literally Elon Musk, you're going to have that one friend who's just a little bit better off than you are.\n\nSo you get people who are *deeply afraid* of being even slightly poorer than they are, who are convinced that if they lose any of their money they're going to lose their connections and their friends and their social standing. And right now they're doing OK. But taxes could go up - or the stock market could go down - and then they wouldn't be doing OK anymore. So they want more, just to be safe. Just to be secure.

(I am aware that this isn't always the case!) \n\nIt is really uncomfortable for me to watch fictional characters be objectified in a sexual way, not because I care about the consent of the fictional characters, but because it reminds me that we live in a society where many people view women and women's bodies in an objectifying way - that is, they want sexual pleasure, but they don't actually value women as people. That discomfort isn't enough for me to condemn a particular piece of media. If I don't like it, I should just not watch it. But growing up in the 90s, whew. There was an amount of objectification that was almost inescapable, in billboards and beer commercials and so on. I feel like this has actually changed a lot, but I don't watch network TV anymore, so it's hard to know. (But I did have to give up anime fandom over the panty shots!) \n\nThe other argument that many feminists would make is that sexual objectification in mainstream entertainment contributes to a culture that objectifies women. Many feminists definitely felt the same way about BDSM and sex work - this was a huge debate during the [feminist sex wars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feminist_sex_wars) of the 70s and 80s, but the anti-BDSM/anti-sex work position is no longer as prominent within mainstream feminism. Joanna Russ is a feminist from that period whose work I respect a lot, and her argument was that the sexual objectification one sees in mainstream entertainment has a much bigger role in shaping the culture than BDSM porn because it's so much more visible and widespread, and because it's seen as acceptable and wholesome. Personally, I don't know to what extent I think sexual objectification in mainstream entertainment contributes to a culture that objectifies women. I tend to think that men learn to be sexist from their families and from their peer groups more than from TV or video games. \n\nThe thing is, if we lived in a society where people did not have to fear harassment and catcalling and being objectified on account of their bodies, I think that sexualization in media would be *totally fine* (though hopefully it would be applied to all genders equally!) - it's only because we're embedded in a society that is deeply sexist in many ways that it becomes a problem.", "created_utc": "1657885118.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ig92kuo", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_vyyo2d", "parent_id": "t3_vyyo2d", "score": "3", "subreddit": "socialjustice101", "subreddit_id": "t5_2vjn1"}, {"author": "Fillanzea", "body": "(Also: gothic historical rather than fantasy, but Fingersmith by Sarah Waters has some excellent asshole moments)", "created_utc": "1657856452.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ig7xt1o", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_vze7pf", "parent_id": "t1_ig7wwbi", "score": "18", "subreddit": "TheNinthHouse", "subreddit_id": "t5_25uoty"}, {"author": "Fillanzea", "body": "The Traitor Baru Cormorant and The Monster Baru Cormorant by Seth Dickinson are dark, messy, brutally painful.

Board of Education.](https://www.vox.com/identities/2019/5/10/18566052/school-segregation-brown-board-education-report) Why? Because of the large number of white parents who put their children in private schools or moved to white suburbs. [And we can argue about how much racism (conscious or unconscious) factors into that decision](https://www.thisamericanlife.org/562/the-problem-we-all-live-with-part-one), but at least some of it comes from a *justified belief* that their kids will get access to worse educational opportunities if they go to schools with a lot of black and brown kids.

And I've lived in neighborhoods that *did* have quite a bit of crime, but I've spent YEARS walking home alone at night, taking public transportation alone at night, without getting mugged. I suspect that impoverished neighborhoods are actually a little safer than slightly more affluent neighborhoods because in a poor neighborhood, no one expects you to have an iPhone or significant amounts of cash or anything worth stealing. (My experience of living in Brooklyn, NY was that most muggings happened in Bushwick/Williamsburg and other areas with a lot of poverty but also a big influx of decently-well-off hipsters)\n\nSo, just coming at this from a practical perspective, the safety precautions you should take in a \"rough\" neighborhood are the safety precautions you should take *anywhere*.

I think it might be more important to make sure that the policies you vote for and advocate for are not policies that rest on the assumption that a certain neighborhood is a crime-ridden hellhole.\n\nThere is a way that people *talk* about neighborhoods they perceive to be poor and unsafe that can definitely be classist and racist, and that is still classist and racist no matter how much they might get defensive and say \"but it really IS unsafe!\" - that is a problem, I think, which is separate from any personal safety measures a person might choose to take.", "created_utc": "1654281205.0", "edited": "1654283358.0", "id": "ib2eg9v", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_v44xsh", "parent_id": "t3_v44xsh", "score": "32", "subreddit": "socialjustice101", "subreddit_id": "t5_2vjn1"}, {"author": "Fillanzea", "body": "You can definitely ask for a Zoom call (I can't guarantee that the agent would say yes, but it's a very reasonable ask) and you can definitely ask to record the call (again, you may not get a \"yes\" but it's a reasonable ask).

For example, \u5e0c is often read as 'Nozomi' in names even though that's not one of the standard on/kun readings, because the meaning of \u5e0c is similar to the meaning of \u671b\u307f.\n\nIn the same way, \u901f\u96c4 is a name that is read as \u306f\u3084\u304a, with the first character meaning 'fast.' So if you switch in \u99ff, which also means 'fast,' you could write it as \u99ff\u96c4. And then, because you're allowed to decide your kid's name is pronounced however you want to pronounce it, you could decide to just decide to leave off the \u96c4 and just pronounce \u99ff by itself as \u306f\u3084\u304a.\n\nMiyazaki was born in 1941, before the reform and standardization of the Japanese writing system following WWII. So he was born before the \u4eba\u540d\u7528\u6f22\u5b57 even existed. But even today, it is allowed (and pretty common) to give your kid a name with a reading that is not related to the standard on and kun readings of the kanji.", "created_utc": "1652118910.0", "edited": "False", "id": "i7y3ond", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_ulvvho", "parent_id": "t3_ulvvho", "score": "18", "subreddit": "LearnJapanese", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qyls"}, {"author": "Fillanzea", "body": "We lost in 2016.

You can call this moving to a \"shitty state,\" but there are a TON of older people in Arizona, New Mexico, North Carolina, etc, who would much rather live there than in Connecticut, as long as they don't actually need to go to Manhattan for their job.\n\n2) Most people don't want to live in a 4-bedroom house forever. At some point, you don't want to do that much housework, you may not want to go up and down the stairs so much, so you may end up moving to an assisted living community or moving in with your kids. At that point, you'd much rather sell your house for a lot of money than just a little money if you end up needing that money to pay for the good assisted living community instead of the crappy one. \n\nI don't say this to endorse people who want their property values to go up astronomically forever.

A famous unconscious violinist. He has been found to have a fatal kidney ailment, and the Society of Music Lovers has canvassed all the available medical records and found that you alone have the right blood type to help. They have therefore kidnapped you, and last night the violinist's circulatory system was plugged into yours, so that your kidneys can be used to extract poisons from his blood as well as your own. The director of the hospital now tells you, \"Look, we're sorry the Society of Music Lovers did this to you--we would never have permitted it if we had known. But still, they did it, and the violinist is now plugged into you. To unplug you would be to kill him. But never mind, it's only for nine months. By then he will have recovered from his ailment, and can safely be unplugged from you.\" Is it morally incumbent on you to accede to this situation? No doubt it would be very nice of you if you did, a great kindness. But do you have to accede to it? What if it were not nine months, but nine years? Or longer still? What if the director of the hospital says. \"Tough luck. I agree. but now you've got to stay in bed, with the violinist plugged into you, for the rest of your life. Because remember this. All persons have a right to life, and violinists are persons. Granted you have a right to decide what happens in and to your body, but a person's right to life outweighs your right to decide what happens in and to your body. So you cannot ever be unplugged from him.\" I imagine you would regard this as outrageous, which suggests that something really is wrong with that plausible-sounding argument I mentioned a moment ago.\n\nThomson suggests that the right to have an abortion has nothing to do with the moral status or cognitive capabilities of the fetus - and everything to do with the pregnant person's right to control their own body. Her idea is that even if we were to say that a fetus deserves all the same rights as any other human being, the pregnant person does not have an obligation to keep the fetus on life support for 9 months.\n\n>If I am sick unto death, and the only thing that will save my life is the touch of Henry Fonda's cool hand on my fevered brow. then all the same, I have no right to be given the touch of Henry Fonda's cool hand on my fevered brow. It would be frightfully nice of him to fly in from the West Coast to provide it. It would be less nice, though no doubt well meant, if my friends flew out to the West coast and brought Henry Fonda back with them. But I have no right at all against anybody that he should do this for me. Or again, to return to the story I told earlier, the fact that for continued life the violinist needs the continued use of your kidneys does not establish that he has a right to be given the continued use of your kidneys. He certainly has no right against you that you should give him continued use of your kidneys. For nobody has any right to use your kidneys unless you give him this right--if you do allow him to go on using your kidneys, this is a kindness on your part, and not something he can claim from you as his due. Nor has he any right against anybody else that they should give him continued use of your kidneys. Certainly he had no right against the Society of Music Lovers that they should plug him into you in the first place. And if you now start to unplug yourself, having learned that you will otherwise have to spend nine years in bed with him, there is nobody in the world who must try to prevent you, in order to see to it that he is given some thing he has a right to be given.\n\nI don't know that this argument is *entirely* convincing to me. I think that if I believed that a fetus was just as much a person, morally speaking, as you and me, I would be *uncomfortable* with a lot of abortions.

And people *definitely* will steal video games to resell them, especially if they're new hot video games. (I would be curious to learn more about how the budget considerations work out in libraries that do lend video games.)\n\nVinyls are an interesting idea. I think music is getting less popular in libraries because it's so easy to stream music - vinyl seems like more of a collector's item, like you would want to keep your vinyls and not just borrow them. Maybe I'm wrong! But CDs are smaller, more durable, easier to store, and more people have CD players - it seems like if a library has a music collection it makes more sense to have it on CD, and they may not have the money to collect both CDs and vinyl. \n\nA lot of these decisions do come down to money, so make sure you support your library, and also, let them know what you want!

The situations in the story allow the writer to bring out those questions in ways that are dramatic, sometimes with very heightened emotions.

It wasn't just \"I hate you because you're different from me,\" it was \"I want to exploit your labor, but I also don't want to feel bad about it, and the only way I can exploit your labor without feeling bad about it is if I believe you're inherently inferior to me.\" So the capitalist system - which tries to get as much labor as possible for as cheaply as possible - invents racism in order to justify slavery. \n\nDoes that stop when slavery ends? No.\n\nA lot of socialist thinkers, from Marx on forward, have written that capitalism requires people who are exploited. From the point of view of someone who has capital (someone who owns a factory, for example), you want people to be kind of desperate, because desperate people will accept lower wages and worse working conditions. And it's really convenient if the division between well-off people and worse-off people falls along racial lines.

How does racism perpetuate capitalism? Well, capitalists try to scare people away from socialism by using racism. They use stereotypes of lazy black people depending on welfare to try to convince people that any move toward a more socialist economy would result in your tax dollars going to people who don't deserve them.

It's going to be very hard for you and me to talk about Hamlet if I insist that Ophelia is alive at the end. Now, maybe my theory is that Ophelia faked her own death, and we can talk about evidence for and against that theory - or we can talk about how our interpretation of the text would change if we assumed that Ophelia did fake her own death - but if you say \"the scene where Gertrude talks about seeing Ophelia's drowned body\" and you say \"that didn't happen,\" then... I don't think we're on the same page enough to have a productive conversation. \n\nBut I certainly disagree with the proposition that arguing with the canon events is taking an incorrect approach to the text. You have as much right as the author to say \"This is how I wanted it to go\" or \"This shouldn't have happened this way.\" Canon events aren't handed down from on high; sometimes the story happens one way instead of another way because the author was rushed on a deadline and couldn't think of anything better, or because the actor had dysentery, or because the original ending didn't play well with test audiences. So why shouldn't you feel free to mess with that? \n\nAnd when I think about fanfiction for movies/TV, a lot of that originates because audiences are dissatisfied with the show killing off female characters, or killing off gay characters, or relegating characters of color to minor roles, and I think it's absolutely legitimate to get pissed off at that and say \"It shouldn't have happened that way.\" \n\nYou can also look at books like Wide Sargasso Sea that come at a text (in this case, Jane Eyre) in order to interrogate the issues with the text (in this case, for example, racism and colonialism).

Author can write basic sentences, but not string them together in any way that adds up to paragraphs.\r  \n\n6. Author has a moderate neurochemical disorder and can\u2019t tell when he or she has changed the subject. This greatly facilitates composition, but is hard on comprehension.\r  \n\n7. Author can write passable paragraphs, and has a sufficiently functional plot that readers would notice if you shuffled the chapters into a different order.

Derrick Bell is one of the key scholars in CRT, so I'll start by quoting from the article:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"Bell spent the second half of his career as an academic and, over time, he came to recognize that other decisions in landmark civil-rights cases were of limited practical impact. **He drew an unsettling conclusion: racism is so deeply rooted in the makeup of American society that it has been able to reassert itself after each successive wave of reform aimed at eliminating it**. Racism, he began to argue, is permanent.\" \n\n\"The civil-rights movement had been based on the idea that the American system could be made to live up to the democratic creed prescribed in its founding documents. **But Bell had begun to think that the system was working exactly as it was intended to - that that was why progress was invariably met with reversal.** Indeed, by the eighties, it was increasingly clear that the momentum to desegregate schools had stalled; a 2006 study by the Civil Rights Project at UCLA found that many of the advances made in the first years had been erased during the nineties, and that seventy-three percent of Black students around that time attended schools in which most students were minorities.\"\n\n\"People who looked at the deaths of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor and others and concluded that they were not anomalies but evidence that the system was functioning as it was designed to, were articulating the conclusion that Bell had drawn decades earlier. '**The gap between words and reality in the American project - that is what critical race theory is**, where it lies,' Perry told me.\" \n\nOne of the big things that comes up in the article (and in Bell's thinking) is the school desegregation supreme court case, Brown v. the Board of Education. The Supreme Court ruled that public schools could no longer be racially segregated. But did that pave the way for racially integrated schools? No, not really. It paved the way for white people putting their kids in private schools (which can no longer legally be racially segregated, but are often de facto segregated just by being very expensive), or moving to \"good school districts\" where the houses are expensive. So... what does it mean that racism seems to keep finding new loopholes to enter in by? What does it means that it's 67 years since Brown v. the Board of Education and schooling is still so segregated for so many?", "created_utc": "1634674129.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hh9x6zi", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_qb73y6", "parent_id": "t3_qb73y6", "score": "4", "subreddit": "socialjustice101", "subreddit_id": "t5_2vjn1"}, {"author": "Fillanzea", "body": "Since pretty much forever, women have had to live with this double bind:\n\n1.

Because the moment you step out of line with regards to what people want or expect from you, either your femininity or your masculinity will be used against you. \n\nI remember the 1980s when everyone was telling women to \"dress for success\" with pantsuits and shoulder pads, so things have definitely improved since then, but I think we still need to fight both of these battles: that having a more feminine gender presentation doesn't make you any less powerful or authoritative, and also, that having a more masculine gender presentation doesn't necessarily make you any less of a woman.", "created_utc": "1634651428.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hh8djft", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_qb574e", "parent_id": "t3_qb574e", "score": "16", "subreddit": "socialjustice101", "subreddit_id": "t5_2vjn1"}, {"author": "Fillanzea", "body": "Hm, the NJ librarian postings I've seen were in the $50k range. \n\nTypical librarian salaries (with a Master's degree) start around $45000.

The most obvious example is sex work: if you have sex for money, you're not going to be enthusiastic about all the sex you have, but you can still meaningfully consent to it. If your partner has a kink you don't share and you indulge it to give them pleasure, you can still meaningfully consent to it even if you're not enthusiastic about it.

Your brain is churning away thinking \"am I okay with this?\" and \"what should I do to get out of this situation without making the other person mad?\" and whether that is visible to the other person is very dependent on how well they're reading your body language and whether they actually care whether you consent or not. This is the type of situation where - the person initiating sex has a moral obligation to *know* whether the other person actually wants to have sex or not, and not just guess.

In other words, she is essentially a lamb to the slaughter and so she might as well wear a short skirt and go to nightclubs in seedy neighborhoods anyway so she can have a little fun before the rape she never had a chance to avoid. The other camp claims that rape avoidance advice does work, but that it is unreasonable or oppressive to expect women to actually follow it, so men shouldn't remind them. For example, maybe avoiding seedy nightclubs actually does statistically reduce the risk of rape, but social justice feels that telling women not to go to those places is more oppressive than the actual risk of rape.   \n>  \n>So, would you say that neither of these camps is entirely accurate?\n\nI don't think that those camps are meaningful in general. They can only apply in terms of *specific advice.* What you're wearing genuinely has absolutely no effect on your risk of sexual assault, it's like the \"onion on your belt\" thing.\n\nA lot of sexual assault is committed within the context of dating or intimate relationships. 33% of sexual assault is committed by a current or former girlfriend/boyfriend/partner/spouse. (That's as opposed to 20% for a stranger). What advice are you going to give someone so that they don't get assaulted by their partner? Maybe to be sensitive to red flags when someone shows signs of being controlling, possessive, entitled, or jealous? But a lot of people are really good at only showing their good side until you're deeply invested into the relationship and it's hard to get out - hard to get out emotionally, but maybe also logistically and financially.\n\nIt's not negligent to fall in love with somebody. It's not negligent to trust somebody who's given you no signs that they shouldn't be trusted. And most rapists seem like perfectly nice guys right up until they don't.\n\nOn the other side of things, you probably can decrease your risk of sexual assault somewhat by either not dating or being very paranoid when you do go on dates. You never go on a date unchaperoned. You never get into someone else's car. You never go home with a date until the relationship has gotten quite serious. I think *that's* the advice that it is unreasonable and oppressive to tell women to follow. If you follow that advice, you're going to get called prudish and paranoid and man-hating. If you follow that advice, you're not going to get a lot of second dates. (A lot of men will think that you should just *know* that they're nice guys, by magic or psychic intuition or because they think all rapists make themselves obvious.) The risk reduction - to the extent that there is one - can't possibly be worth circumscribing your life so severely.\n\nProbably the most common way people get raped is that they're on a date with someone they're into - maybe it's a first date, maybe it's a tenth date, whatever - and they go somewhere private to make out and at some point one person wants to stop and the other person doesn't stop.\n\nWhat advice to you give someone to not get in that situation? Keeping in mind that even if you don't go home with someone until the tenth, twentieth, thirtieth date, you don't know how they're going to act when you're alone together?\n\nIf I know that I'm more likely to get raped by going home with someone I just had a great date with than by going to a seedy nightclub, why the heck shouldn't I go to a seedy nightclub? A rapist can go to a fancy nightclub just as easily as a seedy one.\n\n\\-\n\nI think there is no meaningful difference between hypothetical 'Rape Bears' and real actual bears that won't rape you but might maul you, so I'm going to answer the bear question purely in reference to actual bears.\n\nIt is true that you shouldn't go into bear country without taking precautions against bear attacks. But if you do, blaming someone after the fact is unkind and unhelpful. If you know that someone is going into bear country, by all means, tell them not to go, tell them to take a gun and bear spray and bells to wear on their belt. But if someone has already been mauled by a bear - come on, don't say \"I told you so.\" That's just cruel. Don't rub salt in the wound. They're already full of regret for their decision. You might, at most, gently explore their reasons for going into bear country without taking precautions against bear attacks.\n\nI mean, I used to walk alone at night a lot in rough New York City neighborhoods. It was super safe. Nothing worse ever happened to me than some catcalling. Nevertheless, it was a decision that probably *seemed* dangerous to a lot of people.\n\nI lived in cheap neighborhoods because I couldn't afford expensive ones. I got scheduled for night shifts.

There are a lot of librarians who are trying to divest libraries from law enforcement and the criminal justice system, and certainly, I don't want to get the police involved unless I absolutely have to, but even if we want to de-escalate situations without getting police involved we often don't get the training or resources, and some patrons just need more help than we're able to provide.", "created_utc": "1633229780.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hf6gfoq", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_q00jnv", "parent_id": "t3_q00jnv", "score": "31", "subreddit": "librarians", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qpf2"}, {"author": "Fillanzea", "body": "I think you're missing a big part of this equation, and that part is negligence. The law defines negligence as \"A failure to behave with the level of care that someone of ordinary prudence would have exercised under the same circumstances.\" Blame falls on the person who was negligent. \n\n  \n If I were walking in the Wyoming wilderness without taking any precautions against bear attacks, and I were attacked by a bear, that is probably at least partially my fault. If I were waking in downtown Minneapolis without taking any precautions against bear attacks, and I were attacked by a bear, you could not reasonably say that is my fault, because no person of ordinary prudence thinks there's any chance of being attacked by a bear when they're walking in downtown Minneapolis. And I suppose an unreasonably anxious person could say \"you should take bear spray everywhere you go, just in case,\" but that unreasonably anxious person would quickly get weighed down with 70 pounds of \"just in case\" preparations - so we have to judge based on the person of ordinary prudence, not the unreasonably anxious person.\n\nSometimes no one was negligent. If I'm driving with the same care that I ordinarily would, not speeding, not distracted, and a deer runs out into the road too quickly for me to stop, and I hit the deer, then that's no one's fault. Not the deer's fault, since the deer lacks moral agency, and not my fault, because I was behaving with the level of care that someone of ordinary prudence would have exercised. If I get shot by a three-year-old, that's not my fault and it's not the three-year-old's fault, it's the fault of the person who failed to lock up their gun, and the person who wasn't supervising their three-year-old. \n\nLooking at the example of Ronald Reagan, I'm not actually certain whether I could confidently say that John Hinckley Jr. lacks any moral agency. But either way, we can say that a person of ordinary prudence knows that sometimes people try to assassinate presidents. Did Reagan have adequate security?  Did his security detail behave appropriately? Were there danger signs someone should have caught that they didn't catch? If not - maybe no one deserves the blame, maybe it's just one of those things that happen. And if you're the president of the United States, you can't just shut yourself inside the White House on the chance that someone might try to assassinate you. \n\nNow, if we try to apply this to victim blaming and sexual assault, the problem is that a lot of the stuff that people get victim-blamed for *has nothing to do with your risk of getting sexually assaulted*. It's as if people thought that you could ward off bear attacks by wearing an opal pendant around your neck, and if you got attacked by a bear, someone would ask, \"Oh, but were you wearing your opal pendant?\" That doesn't matter, because the opal pendant is nonsense! It doesn't actually ward off bears! A person of ordinary prudence who studied the crime statistics carefully wouldn't conclude that they shouldn't walk around at night, or that they shouldn't dress in skimpy clothing, because those things *don't matter*. \n\nVictim-blaming exists because people don't accept that you can behave just like a person of ordinary prudence and still get sexually assaulted. They'll say, \"Ah, you should have known better than to get in a car with that guy,\" but - in the course of living your life, sometimes you're going to get in a car with a guy. If we define \"ordinary prudence\" as never doing anything that could increase your risk of being sexually assaulted, then what is a person of ordinary prudence supposed to do? Live a life of total isolation and celibacy? \n\nThe bottom line is that I think it's fine and normal to go out on dates, to spend time alone with people, to drink, to have casual sex, and if we treat those things as things people of ordinary prudence don't do, then we're\n\na) creating a double standard for men and women\n\nb) treating men as if they're bears and three-year-olds, not persons with moral agency\n\nc) going back to a world of very, very restrictive sexual mores - and there are certainly people who want that, but most people don't. Most people who engage in victim-blaming don't. They just believe that it's easy to avoid sexual assault by exercising ordinary prudence - which isn't true.", "created_utc": "1633189227.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hf3x8n9", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_pzuent", "parent_id": "t3_pzuent", "score": "5", "subreddit": "socialjustice101", "subreddit_id": "t5_2vjn1"}, {"author": "Fillanzea", "body": ">I'm doing this on Google docs so I assume it's already a doc file but it keeps getting rejected\n\nNope, a doc file is Microsoft Word.

The transition to the inciting incident with Adrienne feels sudden, and it doesn't seem to matter to the story that much that Jake expected his wife to die.

(Which Harrow correctly diagnoses - \"You're making yourself an utter fool over Dulcinea\" - and Gideon is STILL unable to see it, because A PRETTY GIRL IS BEING NICE TO HER.) \n\n\"Also, as \\[Dulcinea\\] talked she smiled widely and prettily, and moved her lashes up and down. Thus hypnotised, Gideon could only watch with a mouth full of teeth as the blue-eyed necromancer laid one slight, narrow hand on her arm... 'Stand up for me,' said Dulcinea. 'Indulge me. Lots of people do... but I want *you* to.'\"\n\n\"Harrow pushed herself up from the stairs. She had not seemed to notice that Dulcinea was leaning with her flowerlike face in her hands and drinking in her every movement, nor her expression of carefully studied innocence.

You want my juice? I'll give you juice.\"\n\n\"Under no circumstances will I ever desire *your juice*,\" said her necromancer, mouth getting more desperate.\n\n...\n\n\\[Gideon said\\], \"I'll still do it.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Probably because you asked.\"\n\nI think the mix of love and hate and fealty that Gideon has for Harrow is interestingly complex and ambiguous, but there's definitely attraction there, and - pervading the whole book - this feeling that if she can sacrifice herself, endure pain, even die for this person, that will at least be... SOMETHING she can do with these complicated, difficult feelings. A way of showing love without being a creep or asking anything in return (because you know you're not going to get anything in return). That also feels very true to my own queer experiences.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>I wanted to see her mentally wrestle with feelings of attraction alongside reverence and fear with the other \"lesbian\" characters. \n\nBut we're ten thousand years in the future, and it's probably fair to say that the societies in which Gideon and the other characters grew up have really different attitudes toward sexuality than a modern Western/Christian attitude. I think she wrestles with attraction in the sense that she's attracted to people who are bad for her and people who she has contentious relationships with, but I don't know why she would wrestle with attraction in the way that someone who's grown up in a homophobic society would.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Gideon is such a tomboy, for lack of a better term, that she is incredibly similar to the male perspective I've already read plenty of.\n\nAs a slightly butch woman, I feel pretty strongly that the perspective of a butch woman is not the same as the perspective of a man. There's a different relationship to femininity, and to masculinity.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI don't think I've yet managed to really get at what got to me about this book, though. And I think the book handles Gideon's sexuality in a way that's less about love or sex or relationships and more about the experience of being a very lonely, angry, isolated person. Even though Gideon is lonely and angry and isolated more because she grows up orphaned on a dead planet where virtually all her peers have been murdered than because she's gay, the *vibe* is the same. It works as metaphor. The first thing we see Gideon do is try to escape from a place where she can't be who she is.

And I kind of think this is less true these days, because the entire music industry is COMPLETELY different than it was in the 90s, but the 90s is definitely where that \"I like everything except rap and country\" meme comes from. But taste is really, really, social, and it's very dependent on how our communities construct the idea of what's \"good\" or what's \"cool\" - we don't decide what music we like in a vacuum. \n\nYour taste in music probably has been affected by a racist and classist society and a racist and classic music industry - I don't know anyone for whom that isn't true. Rock music came about in the 50s and 60s as DJs and music executives were trying to transform black blues music and early rock music into something played by white artists that they could play on white radio stations, when radio stations and concert venues were often very segregated. Led Zeppelin took a lot of stuff from the blues, the Beatles took a lot of stuff from Motown, and - again I'm going back to my own upbringing in the 90s, I have no idea what things were like for you. But in retrospect I find it really problematic that I was listening to a *very, very* white collection of music that was completely dependent, in a rarely acknowledged way, on a history of borrowing from black music. \n\nAnd the last thing I'll say is that both rap music and country music are a lot wider and deeper than the impression a lot of people have of them.

And books in translation can have a harder difficulty level than books originally written in Japanese just because the translator sometimes has to go to a word that's quite rare in Japanese to correctly translate the English meaning. And of course there's all the extra fantasy vocabulary. I would not recommend that you try to read \u96ea\u56fd right away, but Kawabata isn't bad - the main difficulty is that some of the vocabulary will be old-fashioned.

And I thought, \"Here's a guy who fetishizes free speech so much that he doesn't understand the paradox of tolerance, or else he just likes NRx people and misogynists and outright white supremacists.\" Because it was dispiriting and exhausting to even *read* that comments section as a feminist, let alone post. And - other people on /r/sneerclub have had this same reaction, so I don't think I'm just being a sensitive snowflake - if you go in there as a progressive thinking you're going to have a rational debate with the NRx people and misogynists and outright white supremacists, you realize pretty soon that all you're doing is putting your arm in a piranha tank. (And misogynists can hurt me much more than I can hurt them.) \n\nOkay, so I stopped reading the comments section.\n\nThe second reason was the post about mistake theory vs. conflict theory. I think it's wrong. Not all the time, but a lot of the time, and if you are too quick to think that your opponents are merely making a *mistake* then you're bringing a butter knife to a gun fight. Exxon executives didn't disbelieve in global warming; they knew it was happening and lied about it to serve their own interests. Cigarette executives didn't believe that smoking was fine for your health; they knew smoking caused lung cancer and lied about it to serve their own interests. The richest people in the world are lying right now about corporate taxation. Rationalists, of all people, should know that motivated reasoning is a thing. Even if you look at the debate on abortion, for example, I'm willing to grant that there are a lot of people who really do have a sincerely held belief that a fetus is a human being that deserves the protection of the law, but a lot of Baptists didn't have a problem with Roe v. Wade until... [they had a problem with school desegregation, and abortion became a fig leaf to make a certain group of white conservatives look less racist.](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2014/05/religious-right-real-origins-107133/) That doesn't mean it's not a sincerely held belief for a lot of people, but I think many of the leaders of the \"moral majority\" knew *exactly* what they were doing. (And YES, my own beliefs serve my own interests, and I'm as capable of motivated reasoning as anyone else. I don't mean to only disparage people who disagree with me.) So I think the post is wrong. But, more than that, I thought it was dangerously naive. I started to suspect it was written to convince liberals and progressives to be much more charitable to their opponents than it's smart to be. It was written to convince progressives to bring a butter knife to a gun fight.\n\nAnd then \"You Are Still Crying Wolf\" was the last straw for me. Because on the surface it's written with very good intent, and there were probably people who, in the wake of the 2016, were panicking out of proportion to the actual situation. (Although a slow-moving disaster is still a disaster, and there are decisions by the Trump administration that probably will be felt more ten or twenty years from now than they are right now.) But it also attempts to make the case that Trump is not a white nationalist. Trump, who had *Stephen Miller* as a senior policy advisor. \n\nBy that point I'd been reading SSC for a year or two, which meant I'd read a LOT of words written by Scott Alexander, and I was starting to worry that Alexander's political posts were serving, in effect, to launder white nationalist beliefs to make them more palatable to liberals. \"It's not racist to believe that IQ is heritable!\" \"They're not racist, they're just legitimately worried about border security!\"\n\nAnd I had no idea whether Alexander was doing that on purpose or whether he was just bending over backwards to be charitable about people he disagreed with. But \"You Are Still Crying Wolf\" convinced me that either he knew what he was doing, or he was *dangerously, stupidly* naive about it. \n\nSo. Given what we now know about Alexander's leaked emails... I don't think that Alexander just happens to be privately racist. I think that SSC is written in part to serve as a safe-feeling entry point to white nationalism. Not, like, the *Daily Shoah* kind of white nationalism, or perhaps even the Stephen Miller/Richard Spencer/Steve King variety, but a liberal-seeming rational-seeming veneer of paint on the idea that some races are just inherently smarter than other races. That's why I don't think anyone should read Alexander: some of it is fairly subtle and fairly good propaganda for terrible ideas.\n\n(I realize that all of this is probably going to come off as an unhinged and extremely paranoid reading to a lot of people. There's a lot of slippery wiggle room for \"ALL HE'S SAYING is that...\" in Alexander's posts. All I'll say is that I read SSC sympathetically and charitably for a *long* time before I became convinced of this, and I'm not ordinarily an unhinged or paranoid person.)", "created_utc": "1625314040.0", "edited": "False", "id": "h3wvdyp", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_ocsbm9", "parent_id": "t3_ocsbm9", "score": "115", "subreddit": "SneerClub", "subreddit_id": "t5_39qia"}, {"author": "Fillanzea", "body": "Have you ever read anything about prison abolition?\n\nMariame Kaba says, \"when a civilian has committed an egregious harm, the national solace we are taught to seek is to see them suffer.

Not necessarily because the worst people deserve better than that - but because our societies deserve better than that.\n\nAnd I think that the way you're talking about yourself is an extension of the mentality that the right solution to harm is punishment. But I would invite you to the idea that punishing yourself *also* doesn't \"work\" - whatever it would mean for punishment to \"work.\" Now, you may protest and say you don't have the capacity to make amends, and indeed, nobody has the power to fully make amends for colonialism. Fine. So then I think, \"What would Mariame Kaba say should be done about people who don't have the ability to make amends?\" And I think she would say, first of all, that people only need to make amends for what they actually did, not for what their ancestors did - although we have a collective responsibility for working against historical wrongs like colonialism *to the extent that we can*. But for people who have done harm and can't make amends, she might say that we need to understand violence as an outcome not of specific evil people, but of harmful systems, and the people who cause harm within those systems also need support - they need the tools and resources to do better.\n\nIf you're interested in learning more about moving past punishment, you might be interested [in this podcast](https://forthewild.world/listen/mariame-kaba-on-moving-past-punishment-151) interview with Mariame Kaba.", "created_utc": "1625235738.0", "edited": "False", "id": "h3t3140", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_oc8mbp", "parent_id": "t3_oc8mbp", "score": "8", "subreddit": "socialjustice101", "subreddit_id": "t5_2vjn1"}, {"author": "Fillanzea", "body": "There is a childrens' book series called [\u602a\u8ac7\u30ec\u30b9\u30c8\u30e9\u30f3](https://www.amazon.co.jp/%E6%80%AA%E8%AB%87%E3%83%AC%E3%82%B9%E3%83%88%E3%83%A9%E3%83%B3%EF%BC%881%EF%BC%89%E5%B9%BD%E9%9C%8A%E5%B1%8B%E6%95%B7%E3%83%AC%E3%82%B9%E3%83%88%E3%83%A9%E3%83%B3-%E6%9D%BE%E8%B0%B7-%E3%81%BF%E3%82%88%E5%AD%90/dp/4494004677/ref=sr_1_3?__mk_ja_JP=%E3%82%AB%E3%82%BF%E3%82%AB%E3%83%8A&dchild=1&keywords=%E6%80%AA%E8%AB%87%E3%83%AC%E3%82%B9%E3%83%88%E3%83%A9%E3%83%B3&qid=1625224490&sr=8-3) that is collection of ghost stories/supernatural stories/scary stories that are easy to read.

They are often related to ways a group creates and enforces standards for what is \"normal,\" what makes people belong or not belong. \n\nThe people who make hiring decisions are disproportionately white. That's a kind of power - the power to decide whether you get hired or not. And when they reject someone, it may not be because of conscious bias but a more subtle sense of \"culture fit,\" \"she doesn't really fit in with the rest of us,\" that has been established *really early in their lives* \\- and microaggressions certainly are a part of that. \n\nThere's a part in Claudia Rankine's book \"Citizen\" (which I REALLY recommend for understanding micro-aggressions) where she describes an incident where a black person has scheduled a therapy appointment with someone who has therapy sessions in her house rather than an office. The client gets to the door, and the therapist responds with fear and trying to get her to leave, assuming she's a burglar rather than her appointment. \n\nThere are a lot of striking incidents in \"Citizen,\" but I think that's the one that's stuck with me because it takes so much vulnerability to go to a therapist. You're going to talk to some stranger about everything you're sad or angry about. And, if you're black, you have to place your mental health in the hands of a mostly white system.\n\nDoctor/patient relationships are a place where power is exercised, and doctors are disproportionately likely to be white. Black patients are less likely to be believed when they report pain. That might be a significant contributing factor to worse health outcomes.\n\nOkay, but what about contexts that are purely social? Where both people are definitely on the same level and no one has any power over anyone else? Micro-aggressions are still reminders of the fact that you're seen as different, and that difference isn't neutral.

There are two kinds of consonants, voiced and unvoiced. The voiced ones are the ones that make your vocal cords vibrate. In Japanese, the unvoiced consonants are the \u304b row, the  \u305f row, the \u3055 row, the \u306f row (and also the \u3071 row but that's weird for historical reasons.) The voiced consonants are everything else. \u304b and \u304c are the same sound (they're made with the tongue in the same position) except that one is unvoiced and one is voiced. And that's the case with most of the sounds with dakuten - k/g, t/d, and s/z are unvoiced/voiced pairs, so the version with dakuten is the voiced version of the sound.\n\nThe reason that \u307e\u3001\u3084\u3001\u3089\u3001\u306a don't have versions with dakuten is that those sounds don't have an unvoiced version, they only have a voiced version. This isn't specific to Japanese, there's (I think!) no such thing as an unvoiced 'm' or 'n' in any language. \n\nNow, like I said, \u3071 is weird for historical reasons, because the \u306f row used to be pronounced with a 'p' sound, and the sound changed gradually over many years. Linguistically speaking, the voiced/unvoiced pair of sounds is 'ba' and 'pa,' so logically you would think that \u306f would be 'pa' and \u3070 would be 'ba'... and that's how it USED to work, but it no longer works that way because of that historical sound change. So Japanese has this extra consonant it needs to make room for, and it's the unvoiced version of 'b,' but it can't use the \u306f row because that's already in use... but it still belongs in the same family as the \u3070 row.

The term has really expanded a lot since then as its use has expanded from academia to the wider world. And - I don't think that's necessarily a bad thing. It's useful to draw attention to the fact that having conversations like these can be work, and it can be difficult and emotionally taxing work. But I do think it sometimes means we're putting ideas in the same box that don't really belong in the same box.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>On online discussions (like this), where people are showing up in their free time, specifically because they want to discuss these issues. Is it still emotional labor if the act is intentional?\r  \n\r\n\nVolunteer work is still work! I mean, part of the reason I participate in discussions like this one is that I enjoy it, I enjoy talking about my own opinions, I enjoy sharing knowledge. But sometimes it's with the same feeling of cleaning up after someone else's dog that pooped in your yard: ugh, *someone* has to do it, and I guess it had better be me because the post doesn't have any helpful comments yet. You're choosing to do it of your own free will but you wish it weren't necessary to have this discussion in the first place. \n\nAnd, on one hand, I think it's useful for marginalized people who participate in these kinds of discussions to keep an eye on their own well-being and recognize that it's often the right decision to step back and let someone else have this argument, and it's not the end of the world if this one guy on the internet keeps on having the wrong idea about Black Lives Matter or whatever - but on the other hand, I think it's useful for people who can treat these arguments as just intellectual debates to acknowledge that it feels a lot more fraught and painful to respond to something like \"Black people are more often the victims of police brutality because they commit more crime\" or \"If people just did what police told them to do they wouldn't get shot by police\" when that feels like an accusation against you, your family, your community. And that's where the \"emotional labor\" part comes in - even if that's perhaps not the best term for it. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>In discussions where POC are choosing to share their personal experiences. IE\r  \n\rA: My professor is racist!\r  \n\rB: Can you give an example of his racism?\r  \n\rA: Not unless you're paying me for my emotional labor!\n\nI definitely see where it's frustrating to not have specific examples to understand the situation better. But let's say that A gives an example and B immediately jumps to \"That wasn't racist because...\" or \"I'm sure he didn't mean it that way...\" or \"Are you sure you're not overreacting?\" and... it IS emotional labor to have to prove to someone else that what you experienced was definitely racism. And it sucks when you want empathy and you're getting told that you don't deserve empathy unless you can prove you experienced racism. (And honestly, that leap to \"Are you SURE it was racism?\" happens so often that it's not entirely unreasonable to jump the gun a bit!) \n\nIf A is a friend, then maybe B can start from the standpoint that yes, if A says they experienced racism B's going to trust that they experienced racism. Maybe B can instead say, \"That sounds really tough! Do you want to talk about what happened?\" And maybe A doesn't want to talk about it, maybe they don't want to rehash it again, and...that's fine. If they want to bring an official complaint with the head of the department or the dean or whoever, then yes, \"my professor is racist\" isn't going to be treated as adequate evidence. If B needs more information about Professor Balderston's racism - because, say, they're taking a class with him next semester - then B can say so: \"Hey, I was going to take Professor Balderston's urban planning class next semester, but I know you had a bad experience with him. If you'd be comfortable talking about that, I'd really like to hear more.\" \n\nIf I can give an example from my own academic life, I wrote a novel for an MFA thesis a couple of years ago, and it had a romantic relationship between two women. They were both main characters, they both used she/her pronouns, and... when I talked to my advisor about the draft I submitted to him, he kept referring to one of the characters as \"he.\" Frankly, this was pretty painful. I felt like the queer aspect of the text was just invisible to him. And over the next couple of days I told a few of my friends in the program about what happened, not because I wanted them to pillory my advisor as a homophobe, but because I genuinely did not know how to process this. But every time I did, it was painful as heck. And some of the responses felt really invalidating, and with a lot of the people in my program I said nothing at all, or nothing beyond \"I had a meeting with my advisor about my book, it was rough,\" because I couldn't handle giving more details than that. \n\nI know that's not quite an analogous situation. But when you've experienced these kinds of microaggressions, it can be really difficult to talk about. It can be *work*. And it's absolutely reasonable to say \"I am not able to do this kind of work right now - you can believe me or not, you can be sympathetic or not, but I can't rehash it one more time.\"", "created_utc": "1622642538.0", "edited": "False", "id": "h0bbsgc", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_nqkzjq", "parent_id": "t3_nqkzjq", "score": "13", "subreddit": "socialjustice101", "subreddit_id": "t5_2vjn1"}, {"author": "Fillanzea", "body": ">Is there someone who has grappled with neoliberalism appropriating the language of intersectionality?  \n>  \n\nI think that certainly feminist critics of 1990s corporate \"girl power\" feminism and radical queer critics of assimilation have, and Afropessimism has...

I mean when talking about acquisition alone it would take years wouldn\u2019t it (a child have a parents to correct themselves so basically have a teachers correcting them at all times) ?\n\nIt does take a long time, yeah. But children don't have teachers correcting them at all times! Researchers on child language acquisition have noticed a couple of things:\n\n1) Most of the things we know about language are things we were never taught. \n\nJust for an example, \"Who did Mary disbelieve our claim that Bill had invited?\" is a grammatically wrong sentence, even though you can make sense of it if you think about it. (We claimed that Bill invited Sue, Sally, and Sam. Mary didn't believe that Bill had invited one of those three people. Which one didn't she believe Bill had invited?) The vast majority of English speakers would never say a sentence like that even though they have never been taught why it's bad. \n\n2) Young children are, actually, very resistant to correction! They often don't pay attention to their parents' corrections - or, if forced, they pay attention for a minute and go back to saying it the way they said it before.\n\n3) Parents mostly don't correct their children's errors. They do some of the time. But they don't do it consistently when they can still interpret the sentence correctly. \n\nStephen Pinker's books \"The Language Instinct\" and \"Words and Rules\" are pretty good general introductions to the idea that *child* language acquisition, at least, is largely unconscious. (It's more controversial whether adult language acquisition can be largely unconscious!)\n\n>Full immersion would be incredibly hard if you don\u2019t understand anything in the beginning, wouldn\u2019t be ?\n\nYeah, definitely. \n\nA lot of people seem to think that Krashen advocates full immersion, when actually, he really doesn't. He advocates comprehensible input. Input that you can understand. It's actually pretty hard to get comprehensible input outside the classroom when you're starting from zero. And Krashen doesn't focus on adult self-studiers; his focus (and the focus of most 2nd language learning research) is classroom language acquisition. \n\nBut in a classroom, well, suppose I come into the classroom and I say, \"I sit down,\" and I pair that with a gesture for sitting down, and I sit down. And then I say \"I stand up,\" and I pair that with a gesture, and I stand up. And then I go through that a few more times. Maybe I write on the blackboard the English words and their translations. Then I say, \"Class, you stand up,\" and I use the same gesture from before. And maybe I point at the translations on the blackboard if students aren't catching on. \n\nThat's Total Physical Response, and it's one instruction method that's based on comprehensible input. \n\nYou can get pretty far just having students respond to commands, it turns out. But you can also incorporate storytelling, using pictures and translations and *very limited vocabulary* to make sure that students can understand the stories. And you can make the stories interactive, by asking students to throw in their own answers to help you build the story. (\"Class, Naruto is hungry. What does Naruto want to eat?\")\n\nAnd that's another instruction method based on comprehensible input, called TPRS.\n\nIt's hard to replicate those kinds of methods if you're self-studying. \n\nI think that Krashen is fundamentally right, and if you're spending a lot of time drilling vocabulary and drilling grammar but you're not actually reading and hearing the language, it's not going to *stick* in a way that helps you use the language.\n\nBut I also think that if you don't have access to a lot of COMPREHENSIBLE input - not just \"I'm gonna listen to a ton of TV and radio and hope it sinks in by magic\" - you kind of have to study quite a bit until you get to the point where you can understand books and TV and that sort of thing.\n\nHere's a whole (free) book by Krashen, [Principles and Practice in Second Language Acquisition](http://www.sdkrashen.com/content/books/principles_and_practice.pdf), that explains his ideas in more detail.", "created_utc": "1621968476.0", "edited": "False", "id": "gzf8jzr", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_nkw0k7", "parent_id": "t3_nkw0k7", "score": "11", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "Fillanzea", "body": "\u306b can be used for a lot of kinds of \"destinations,\" both literal destinations (\u304c\u3063\u3053\u3046\u306b\u3044\u304f\uff09and more metaphorical destinations \uff08\u307f\u304b\u305f\u306b\u304b\u3048\u308b\uff09.

Studies tell us that racial disparities cannot be explained by poverty and substance abuse alone (McRoy, 2004). McRoy, a social work researcher, educator, and scholar, writes, \u201cIt is time that we acknowledge that the overrepresentation of African American children in the system has been affected by racism and racial inequities in the child welfare practice and policy arena, economic system, criminal justice system, legal system, and welfare system, as well as society as a whole (p 56).\u201d However unequivocally proving that racism is the cause of disparities is very difficult. Cross, social work educator and executive director of National Indian Child Welfare Association, writes, \u201cThe real culprit appears to be our own \\[social workers\\] desire to do good and to protect children from perceived threats and our unwillingness to come to terms with our fears, deeply ingrained prejudices, and ignorance of those who are different from us (p 11).\u201d According to Cross, these factors result from race or culture bias (frequently unintended) that pervades the field of social work.\n\n[Our systems meant to help are hurting black families](https://www.nichq.org/insight/our-systems-meant-help-are-hurting-black-families)\n\nHere's a story of a situation where doctors called CPS on a woman who'd just given birth because she tested positive for marijuana - and she ended up losing her shelter and having both her kids have to go into foster care temporarily.

But that doesn't mean they try to force a Marxist (for example) reading of every text they read. It means that they read a *lot,* and sometimes they find a text that makes them say \"Ooh, a Marxist reading of this book would be really interesting!\"\n\n>If I can't identify what school of criticism my paper falls under, am I actually doing criticism, or am I doing something else?\n\nYes, you're doing criticism!\n\nIf you were building a house and you'd only seen a few houses in your life, I wouldn't expect you to be able to build a Cape Cod house or a Craftsman house or a Dutch Colonial house. You might be able to do a really good job of putting up walls and doors and the roof, and it might be a really good house in no particular style. But I would expect you to have to see a bunch of Craftsman houses and also read a fair bit about what's unique about Craftsman houses before you could build one for yourself.\n\nYou've had a little taste of a bunch of literary theories, but you're not yet really well-versed in any of them. So it makes sense that you're writing criticism that doesn't fit precisely into any of those boxes. A more experienced literary critic might look at that idea of solitude in The Awakening and look at it through specifically a New Criticism lens or a feminist lens or a New Historicist lens. And they can do that because they've read a lot of criticism that fits into those schools, and they've also read about the theoretical approaches other critics take.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Since my English department requires this process of naming a school of theory, should I change my strategy in future papers?\n\nI mean... how much are you graded on how well the school of theory you name matches the paper you write?\n\nBecause honestly, you *could* just decide that whenever you write a paper that focuses just on what's in the text, that's New Criticism, and whenever you write a paper that brings in the social/historical context, that's New Historicism.\n\nOkay, I'm being a little flippant there.\n\n>Taking into consideration that I have already taken a course in literary theory and criticism, what would you recommend for me so that I can better understand theory and criticism? (I have a lot of trouble understanding how to employ structuralism and post-structuralism/deconstruction.)\n\nYeah, everybody has a lot of trouble understanding how to employ structuralism and post-structuralism.\n\nOkay, here's what I recommend: figure out one specific theory/school that interests you. Read at least one book about it and at least three or four papers that analyze a text using that theory. Then take a book you know very well, perhaps a book from your childhood, and try to think how you would analyze it using that theoretical framework.\n\n[Even Donald Duck can be analyzed through a Marxist and post-colonial framework](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_to_Read_Donald_Duck) (and actually, I really encourage you to read literary criticism of things like children's books).\n\nYou don't have to try to wrap your head around the post-structuralists unless you actually *want* to, except for classes that are specifically for learning about literary criticism.\n\n(Probably). \n\n(I know about post-structuralism because I took a couple of film classes from a professor who was really into Baudrillard and assigned us to read a bunch of Baudrillard... but even there, he didn't make us do post-structuralist readings of anything.)", "created_utc": "1621470896.0", "edited": "1621471211.0", "id": "gyrk3z0", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_ngiie7", "parent_id": "t3_ngiie7", "score": "11", "subreddit": "AskLiteraryStudies", "subreddit_id": "t5_2tltc"}, {"author": "Fillanzea", "body": "The sequel to Aristotle and Dante is coming out this fall!

If you teach literature at the college level, you're teaching people who want to become writers and people who want to become English teachers and people who need an extra elective to fill out a distribution requirement.\n\nMy tenth grade English teacher was big on reader response theory, and that shaped what kinds of assignments he assigned, and how he graded, and so on. Debates about the purpose of literature, the development of the canon, how we look at social issues and marginalization in text - those are all debates that happen through the academic research on literature, and they *deeply* shape how high school English classes are taught. \n\nIt takes a while for ideas in the academic literature to filter down. (Looking back, I'm a little amazed by just how white the assigned reading lists were in my late-90s high school classes.) And curricula are politicized in ways that often make it hard for teachers to teach what and how they want to teach. But if literary theory had frozen in time in the 1950s, I think that students would still be taught about a canon of \"great works\" where everything significant just happens to have been written by white men (plus perhaps Emily Dickinson or a Bront\u00eb) in a way that seems really out of date now. \n\nLiterary theory isn't just about \"how do we analyze these texts?\" - it's implicitly about \"how do we teach other people to analyze these texts?\" for a lot of students. And that has made, I think, quite a lot of difference.", "created_utc": "1620649824.0", "edited": "False", "id": "gxlmsiw", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_n8ylrb", "parent_id": "t1_gxlibpa", "score": "3", "subreddit": "AskLiteraryStudies", "subreddit_id": "t5_2tltc"}, {"author": "Fillanzea", "body": "I would say it's closer to \"continue by sheer force of will in the face of opposition.\" It's the opposition that defines \"powering on,\" rather than the continued enthusiasm.", "created_utc": "1620647840.0", "edited": "False", "id": "gxljolu", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_n92l2u", "parent_id": "t3_n92l2u", "score": "6", "subreddit": "writing", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh2n"}, {"author": "Fillanzea", "body": "Stamped from the Beginning by Ibram X.

And how that happened was bittersweet - \n\nWhat happened is that I was writing a novel with a central sapphic relationship for my creative writing thesis, and I had a conference about it with my advisor, and my advisor kept calling the lesbian character (who specifically identifies herself as a lesbian several times in the text!) \"he,\" as if the queerness of that relationship was invisible to him. As if the text only made sense to him if he saw that character as a man. For a while I felt angry and invalidated (and sad, because he had been a really kind and thoughtful advisor to me) and then... it just kind of became blazingly obvious that I was taking this personally *because it was personal to me* and my queerness wasn't just about the romantic or sexual relationships I'd had or not had, it was about me as a whole person. Who put a lot of myself into both the women in the couple I'd written.\n\nOther than writing a novel, I feel like it's been really important and validating to me to consume lesbian culture - whether that's Sarah Waters and Audre Lorde or TikTok - and also having good platonic friends who are queer. Both of those things make me feel like my sexuality isn't invisible or irrelevant just because I'm not in a relationship. And playing around with how I present myself - I got quite a bit more butch once I started to get over the fear of people thinking I was a lesbian!\n\nSo... I think a lot of us struggle with not just the loneliness of wanting a partner, but not feeling valid in oneself without being defined by a partner.

After a Democratic governor was elected in 2018, he partially repealed that bill. \n\nSo: If there's a bad law in your state, write to your state senator and state representative about it.

If it's not in your state, you can still give money to political candidates who oppose the law. \n\n\\#2: Before the 2015 Supreme Court case Obergefell v.

In the same-sex marriage cases, the people who had standing were people who wanted to get married but couldn't. (Or for example, in Jim Obergefell's case, he married his partner in Maryland because they couldn't get married in Ohio, and he wanted to be listed as the surviving spouse on the death certificate, but Ohio wouldn't recognize that.) \n\nSo: If you have standing, and you can find a lawyer who'll take the case, you can sue the government. If you don't want to sue the government, the best thing you can do is donate to an organization that is organizing a court case challenging that law.

Sometimes that's because they're writing about their own feelings and experiences, and when their writing gets criticized it feels like their own feelings and experiences are being criticized. Sometimes it's because they believe it says something bad about them if they wrote something that's not as successful as they wanted - sometimes it's a feeling of guilt or shame (\"I'm bad because I wrote this\") or just the embarrassment you might feel if you messed up while giving a presentation for school. \n\nSo a lot of writers need to make the shift from seeing their writing as *who they are* to seeing their writing as *what they did*. It's not about something inherent in you as a person, it's about skills that you can learn. Imagine you were just starting out with a martial art or a musical instrument. Would it feel embarrassing when the teacher said \"You have to make a fist this way\" or \"You have to hold your pick like this\"? I think it feels a little less embarrassing, at least, because when you're a beginner you can sometimes let go of that pressure to already be good. You can get the \"Oh, that's good to know!\" without the embarrassment of \"I should have already known this.\" \n\nBut the truth is - there is nothing you should have already known. There is no \"should have\" because there's no going back in time. There's just what you know how to do and what you don't know how to do yet. \n\nA few years ago I was a teaching assistant for a composition class, and it was going really badly, and I felt so badly about being a bad teacher. And my friend who is a much better teacher than I am went through some specific tips and techniques with me - and I was able to make that shift from thinking \"I'm a bad teacher and this means I'm bad\" to thinking \"Teaching involves a lot of skills and techniques and these are skills that I can acquire if I try.\" \n\nI still have to remind myself that there is nothing I can write that makes me any less of a valuable and worthy person. I still have to remind myself that writing is always something I can learn to do better. (Carol Dweck's writing on \"growth mindset\" might be valuable here. So might Brene Brown's writing on shame.) \n\nHaving said all that, it's easier said than done. But the easiest way to do it - I think - is to show your writing to people who support you.

But he's also a thriller writer. He writes the kind of books that you want to be able to read really fast without thinking too hard about them. And that's not a kind of book I'm interested in reading, probably, but if they were filled with lyrical, deep, psychologically introspective prose, they wouldn't work as thrillers. \n\nSo it's not \"you're allowed to write bad prose if the story is exciting.\" It's \"the best prose for your work changes depending on what kind of story you're writing.\"", "created_utc": "1619804857.0", "edited": "False", "id": "gwg8ber", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_n1yo7r", "parent_id": "t3_n1yo7r", "score": "3", "subreddit": "writing", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh2n"}, {"author": "Fillanzea", "body": "> I've had a play with Access and it's going to be just as much work setting that up as fiddling with a spreadsheet. \n\nI kind of don't think there's a way to get around that.

We don't know enough about who she is as a person - not even her age, which could be seven or seventeen - and I think it does too much to define her by how much she weighs. \n\n> represents everything the Allen family is not: rebellious, multicultural, emotionally detached.  \n\nThis tells me something about Sienna but not much about the Allens; it's hard to define something through negative space. Even something like \"represents everything the white-bread, conformist Allen family is not\" would do more to frame this - but I want to know more about Mandy, or about the relationship between her and Sienna. Does Mandy just have a sister-shaped hole in her life? Or is there something particularly compelling about Sienna?\n\nOn the other hand, I don't know how much of the book is spent on the earlier section vs. the later section (after Sienna returns), but you could also consider trimming these paragraphs - not cutting them out completely, but cutting them to what's essential. I have a thought that maybe the characters you need to be developing are older-Mandy and older-Sienna, more than younger-Mandy and younger-Sienna. \n\n> Sienna is just beginning to emotionally thaw when Mandy unearths Sienna's illicit habit, \n\nWhat's her illicit habit? \n\n>   \nAs Mandy ascends into adulthood, she has to wrestle with not only why Sienna returned- but what happened in Sienna\u2019s life during her years of absence. As Mandy navigates all of the harrowing mundanity of growing into an adult -including love, failing friendships, body image, and parental ties- she is determined to figure out what made Sienna leave...and what can make her stay. \n\nThis is pretty good - it's vague, but you don't want to get too specific about the middle and ending of the book. But I think there's still something missing. How does Mandy feel about how Sienna left? (Does she feel guilty? Does she blame Sienna?) What is it that makes her need to know why Sienna left? Does this still feel as emotionally raw to Mandy as it did ten years earlier, and why? What happened in Sienna's life during her years of absence - and more importantly, how does that affect her now?

If you're a young and pretty woman, many men will go out of their way to be gentlemanly to you who do *not* go out of their way to be gentlemanly to older and less-pretty women. And it's not because they're angling to hit on the woman, necessarily... but they may be doing it at least in *part* because the gratitude of a young and pretty woman is worth something.

And actually, this is the case for *most* stories, at least a little bit. Harry Potter got hugely successful because everybody has wished to have some mysterious and heroic and previously unknown parentage, and the sense of kinship and camaraderie that Harry experiences as he goes to Hogwarts is very comforting. You could say the same about Star Wars. You could say the same about any literary novel where the male protagonist finds himself having considerably more and better sex than the author is having. Of course we want to read about people whose lives are more interesting than our own, of course we read to get some of that vicarious sense of comfort or heroism... But that's the challenge. The challenge is to take your own particular dreams and make them universal. And you can't do that without getting vulnerable, without writing a character who isn't psychologically bulletproof but has genuine anxieties and disappointments, who's gone through a dark night of the soul. If you can get vulnerable like that, then you can write a gorgeous and competent character and not write a Mary Sue. If you can't get vulnerable like that, then it doesn't matter how many flaws you stick on your protagonist.\n\nAnd the thing I want to emphasize is that *everyone* goes through the Mary Sue stage as a writer. That's not just people who are writing characters who are beautiful and competent, it's also writers who are writing characters with over-the-top tragic angsty backstories, it's writers who are writing characters who are over-the-top violent psychopaths, it's writers who are writing characters who are absolutely ordinary but get swept off their feet by a perfect romantic partner. It all comes from the same wish-fulfilment place, and we all start out there, *and that's fine*. \n\n(But ideally we grow out of it at some point.)", "created_utc": "1616259391.0", "edited": "False", "id": "grls304", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_m9a4bk", "parent_id": "t3_m9a4bk", "score": "5", "subreddit": "writing", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh2n"}, {"author": "Fillanzea", "body": "It could be either.

N4 if you have a lot of patience for looking things up in a grammar reference). You wouldn't JUST be learning formal grammar at this stage, you'd be reading easy texts like graded readers, the dialogues in your textbook, etc. You could try to muddle through native texts - I know I did - but not so much that you get too frustrated running into sentences you can't parse. \n\n2) Immersion (with a little grammar study - this can be looking grammar points up in a grammar reference as you encounter them in native materials)\n\n3) When you do enough immersion, you start to develop intuitions about what sounds right and sounds wrong - that's what people talk about when they talk about \"acquiring\" a language rather than \"learning\" it.\n\nA lot of the early research on learning through comprehensible input came from French and Spanish classrooms, where you have to learn to conjugate verbs for \"I,\" \"you,\" \"he/she/it,\" \"we,\" \"you(plural)\" and \"they\" in the present, past, imperfect, subjunctive, *imperfect subjunctive*, etc, and in traditional classrooms, and there are a bunch of irregular verbs and a bunch of verb classes, and it's a lot of drilling. So one of the insights of input-based teaching is that you can just say that \"nous savons\" means \"we know\" when it comes up, get a bunch of repetitions for it, instead of drilling a lot on \"je sais, tu sais, il sait, nous savons, vous savez, ils savent\" - focus on grammar for understanding what it means, not being able to immediately output the pattern.

But people's social circles tend to be kind of segregated (which may very often be unintentional, the consequence of schools and workplaces that aren't diverse), so it's not surprising if there's a bit of an echo chamber effect. When my white midwestern friends make Facebook posts about politics or social justice issues, almost everybody responding to them is white, because... that's who their friends and family are. (And this can be a problem because \"nothing about us without us\" is a principle that makes sense. But at the same time, when the burden of talking about those issues falls exclusively on marginalized people, that's a recipe for burnout.)\n\nAnother part of this is that the social justice activism that's most visible to the mainstream media is centered on elite universities, because the media tend to be racist and classist and really overestimates the value of an Ivy League (or Oberlin or Smith or wherever) degree. Some elite universities are doing pretty well in terms of racial diversity, but lots are pretty white - Oberlin is only 5% Black. And those elite colleges are often where there are high-profile dustups about, say, the authenticity of the food in the cafeterias. Which is an issue worth discussing but also an issue that... if it's the biggest thing you have to worry about, you're probably kind of privileged. If you're going to Oberlin in the first place, you're probably kind of privileged. If you look at social justice as being not just about these high-profile dustups but about prison and policing and immigration and housing discrimination, you see how many Black people are involved in social justice movements, both historically - abolition, civil rights, Black feminists like bell hooks and Audre Lorde - and today. \n\nThere are indeed a lot of Black people who are socially/religiously/politically progressive, and there is a lot of Black social justice activism.

Do you know anything about poetic meter? (iambic, trochaic, etc?) John Gardner has a good (brief) section on this in his book The Art of Fiction. It can be useful to mark up a passage with the stressed and unstressed syllables.\n2. Sentence variety and sentence structure: take a passage you like and analyze the structure of the sentences. \n\nAn example, from Piranesi by Susanna Clarke:\n\nI climbed up the Western Wall until I reached the Statue of a Woman carrying a Beehive, fifteen metres above the Pavement. The Woman is two or three times my own height and the Beehive is covered with marble Bees the size of my thumb. One Bee -- this always gives me a slight sensation of queasiness -- crawls over her left Eye. I squeezed Myself into the Woman's Niche and waited until I heard the Tides roaring in the Lower Halls and felt the Walls vibrating with the force of what was about to happen.\n\n>I climbed up the Western Wall until I reached the Statue of a Woman carrying a Beehive, fifteen metres above the Pavement.\n\nTwo clauses joined by the conjunction \"until. The subject of both is \"I.\"\n\n>The Woman is two or three times my own height and the Beehive is covered with marble Bees the size of my thumb.\n\nTwo clauses joined by the conjunction \"and.\" Both clauses have \"is\" as the main verb, and both clauses have the narrator describing something in terms of his own body.\n\n>One Bee -- this always gives me a slight sensation of queasiness -- crawls over her left Eye. \n\nThis is one clause interrupted by another clause, which breaks up the structural repetition of this paragraph. (It's clearly worse if this sentence is \"One Bee crawls over her left eye, and this always gives me a slight sensation of queasiness,\" right?)\n\n>I squeezed Myself into the Woman's Niche and waited until I heard the Tides roaring in the Lower Halls and felt the Walls vibrating with the force of what was about to happen.\n\nAgain we've got some clauses joined by \"and\" and \"until.\" \n\nSo in this paragraph, I notice that these sentences tend to start with the subject, and this is something that a lot of sophisticated writers tend to avoid, because it can feel repetitive. But Susanna Clarke is a sophisticated writer, and she's doing it on purpose. These sentences also tend to consist of clauses joined by conjunctions. These two things together make it feel just a little bit childish -- you know the way a child will narrate their day, or a movie plot, with just a string of \"and then this happened, and then this happened, and then this happened\"? And yet you couldn't imagine a child that young saying they \"felt the Walls vibrating with the force of what was about to happen.\" The narrator isn't a child, but he lives a simple life in a very constrained world, and the structure of the sentences reflects that.\n\n3. Take a passage and circle metaphors, similes, striking images.\n\n4. Rewrite a passage of your own work, or the work of another writer, in the style of a writer who has a strong, distinctive style: Hemingway is popular, but it's easy to slide into parody.\n\n5. Read a passage out loud\n\n6. Take a short passage and circle every word that seems significant. (It should be more than one or two per sentence, if it's by a good writer.) Why did the writer choose that word and not some different word? Does it have something to do with the etymology of the word, or with the word's connotations? Is it a metaphor or simile, and if so, how does it work? (Is there a pattern of similar metaphors through the book?) \n\n7.

So if being trans is a contributing factor to being low-income -- and to engaging in survival sex work, which can be risky whether you're cis or trans -- then I think it's reasonable to say that being trans is a contributing factor to getting murdered.\n\nPublic health researchers are definitely aware that it's difficult to get statistics on how many trans people are murdered, because you can't analyze the murder rate of trans people vs. cis people without knowing what percentage of the population is trans, and because the people recording the death information may not correctly record whether the victim was cis or trans. (If the victim was closeted to their family, or their family members in contact with the police misgendered the victim, for example.) \n\nThe best numbers I found on this were in the American Journal of Public Health (citations below). If you assume that transgender people make up 0.35% of the population, and deaths of trans women aren't being undercounted, then black trans women 15-35 are about 4 times as likely to be murdered as black cis women 15-35, and latina trans women 15-35 are about 2.4 times as likely to be murdered as latina cis women 15-35. Trans people who are white, over 35, or transmasculine aren't really at a higher risk of murder than cis people (and may in fact be at a lower risk of murder).\n\n> Transfeminine residents aged 15 to 34 years who were Black or Latina were almost certainly more likely to be murdered than were their cisfeminine comparators. Indeed, as Table 1 shows, a large majority of transgender homicide risk is borne by young Black and Latina transfeminine individuals. Because the rate of cismasculine murders among Black and Latino US residents aged 15 to 34 years is so high, the possibility that transfeminine Black or Latina residents aged 15 to 34 years have even higher rates of being murdered is alarming. The gendering of and legal vulnerability of sex work coupled with severely curtailed economic opportunities driving poor, young, Latina or Black, and transfeminine individuals into sex work suggests that the high rates in these groups may express anti\u2013sex worker violence, as similarly observed in Italy.\n\nDinno, Alexis, ScD,M.P.H., M.E.M.

Goddamn jealous, controlling woman, freezing him out just because he wanted to have a couple of beers with his friends.\n\nSo I read a couple of pages of a recent Chuck Palahniuk novel, and a lot of it is in a pretty-close-to-objective point of view, but within the first few pages: (He has just seen a girl in the airport who's the age his own daughter was when she disappeared.)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>At first he wasn't thinking. That's not how the human heart works. He knew in his head how age progression worked. The pictures on milk cartons. How every year they computer age the kids until adulthood and then only every five years after that.\n\nSo on the one hand I want to call him out a little for being a hypocrite, and on the other hand, if you can't get into the character's thoughts it's just a guy glimpsing a girl at the airport. You need to get into the character's head to put any emotional significance or weight into it.\n\nAnd at the same time, there's a real difference between this passage and something that tells you more directly what he's thinking:\n\n>It wasn't her, it couldn't have been her. She would have been much older now. But it took his heart a second to remember that.\n\nThere's a little less distance between the reader and the narrator because we get to see the messiness of his thoughts rather than the already-parsed-and-interpreted version - and it's anchored with concrete details even if they're only concrete details within the character's head.\n\nAnyway, I agree with you that \"show, don't tell\" works pretty badly as an all-purpose Swiss Amy Knife aphorism, and that it's a problem to say \"get rid of all thinking verbs\" without addressing the issue of internal monologue at least a *little*.

ISU is primarily a science and engineering school, and it's also a state school, and... the idea is that when you do research, as a graduate student, that research should be for the benefit of everybody, not just so you can stick it in a closet.

[This is one of the better demonstrations on YouTube.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9jKfHRZQfs) Essentially, you're making up stories with the class's help - stories with famous people or characters, or stories with students in the class. You have a few phrases or words that you're focusing on, with translations provided. You ask students questions about the story - both to move the story forward and to verify comprehension (and get more repetitions.) \n\nSo for example, Terry Waltz in the video starts by asking in Mandarin, Is Barney the Dinosaur cool? Is Justin Bieber cool? Is Mike Wazowski cool? And then she says, \"Justin Bieber cries.\" She uses \"ku\" with falling intonation (\"cool\") and \"ku\" with high intonation (\"cries\") because tone is important in Mandarin, and she wants to get students listening for the difference between \"cries\" and \"cool.\" And then she does circling, which is a key concept in TPRS, to get tons of repetitions of a phrase. \n\nJustin Bieber cries. Does Mike Wazowski cry? No, Mike Wazowski doesn't cry. Is Justin Bieber cool? No, he's not cool. Is Mike Wazowski cool? Yes, Mike Wazowski is cool. Along the way, you're doing a lot of checking for comprehension - which might be in the students' own language for the very first classes, but can be in the target language very quickly.\n\nAs students are ready for more input, you can interview them about their lives and do circling around those questions - \"Mark, do you play a sport?\" \"I play basketball.\" \"When do you play basketball?\" \"On Saturdays.\" \"Who do you play with?\" \"My brother.\" Then you can circle around those words with the rest of the class: \"Does Mark play baseball or basketball? Does he play basketball on Saturdays or on Tuesdays? Does Mark play with his brother or with LeBron James?\" And you can jump off of that to make up a story - with class input - about Mark playing basketball with LeBron James. \n\nIf this is something that sounds interesting, there are various books and workshops and blogs that talk in more detail about it.

Not children's books, which can have surprisingly sophisticated language, but easy books with very limited vocabulary, written with the needs of Spanish I students or Spanish II students in mind. How much pleasure reading is in the average Spanish I textbook? How much pleasure reading does the average Spanish I student get assigned?

But if you look at monomyth/hero's journey stuff, I think you have to look at fairy tales and myths - where the romantic relationship is often an essential part of the happy ending, but it doesn't do much to humanize the protagonist. I think that subtextually, a romantic relationship can symbolize the reintegration of the protagonist into their community (interestingly, Sam gets married, but Frodo doesn't); it can symbolize the reconciliation/integration of opposites; it can be about fertility (by which I mean there are a lot of myths where the fertility of the land or the changing of the seasons is related to sex and/or marriage); it can be a part of a coming-of-age story, in the sense that getting married and having children are often seen as markers of being a 'real adult.'\n\n&#x200B;\n\n> is there another way to humanize the characters? \n\nI think humanizing the characters is less about making the characters not be steadfast Churchillian machines and more about making sure that we keep our eyes on the small story. And by \"small story,\" I mean what Chuck wending means when he says that the [small story is larger than the big story.](http://terribleminds.com/ramble/2013/07/16/25-things-to-know-about-your-storys-stakes/) We care about Frodo's suffering as he tries to get the ring to Mount Doom more than we care about the outcomes of the big military battles - or at least, we mostly care about the outcomes of the big military battles because we care about Frodo trying to get the ring to Mount Doom. \n\nAnd that's often a romantic relationship because of the huge symbolic weight of Marriage, but it definitely doesn't have to be. I think it's really hard if it's not a human relationship at all. I've written solitary journeys, I've written stories where the protagonist spends a lot of time in her own head, and it's *hard*. It's a lot easier to make dialogue interesting than to make internal monologue interesting. Even if the conflict is largely internal, internal conflict gets dramatized when the protagonist pushes up against *other people*. The Lord of the Rings is a much stronger story because we don't just see Frodo suffering under the weight of the ring, we see how that affects Sam as well. \n\nThen I think about Star Wars, which kicked off this whole obsession with copying the hero's journey. And of course there is a romantic relationship in it - but it's not Luke's. Luke has the saddest romance of \"saves a pretty girl -> girl more into the other guy -> girl turns out to be his sister.\" Luke's \"small story\" isn't a friendship story or a family story or a romance - it's a coming-of-age story, a becoming-a-man story. But it works, in part, because of all the relationships in the story - Luke's relationships with his friends and his mentors, and also Han's relationships (with Leia but also with Chewbacca, the hinted backstory with Lando Calrissian...) \n\nThe small story is larger than the big story, and characters are interesting because of how they bounce off other characters.

I don't think I'm especially gentle or conflict-averse, but when I have these kinds of conversations they tend to go more like \"Let's say sex worker instead of prostitute, that's considered more inclusive these days\" than like \"How dare you be so insensitive as to say that!?\", or like \"Hm, yeah, I think it can be really hurtful how we're raised to think that it's not manly to be emotional in certain ways\" than like \"Toxic masculinity!!!\" - and that's *also* been true when I've been the person getting called out. I'm not saying this kind of shaming never happens, but I think it happens more rarely than this article would suggest - \n\n\\-and when it does happen it's usually not targeted at the innocently ignorant, but at the well-educated and powerful who choose to be bigoted.\n\nI think what happens too often, unfortunately, is that when people get exposed to the idea that X is bigoted or uninclusive, they get angry and defensive and double down and convince themselves that \"No, it's the children who are wrong!\" And I think that's understandable. I think the idea that you've done a bigoted thing without realizing it can be really scary. But - the author of this article seems to want to say that toxic masculinity and microaggressions are important issues BUT... we shouldn't talk about them because they're alienating? And I don't think that works. I think if they're important issues you have to make room to talk about them, using the language that academics have developed to talk about them, not because they want to be snotty and exclusionary but because specialized language can be really useful. I think you can make room for both \"It's sad when we punish boys for crying or being afraid!\" and \"toxic masculinity\" but if you restrict discourse to the former, we're kind of stuck at a 101 level of discourse. There are conversations about science and economics and foreign policy on Twitter that are way over my head and that's fine, the author isn't talking to me, and in the same way, I think it's fine when there are conversations about social justice on Twitter that are for people who are already more or less up to speed on the discourse.

These aren't UC Berkeley students or coastal hipsters. These are issues that lots of working Americans understand and care about. And - I guess I see a parallel with what happened in the 1960s, how the women's lib movement came about in large part because women who participated in leftist groups kept getting told that women's concerns were unimportant compared to the REAL issues.

Good publishers recognize that you can't invest money into every author, because a lot of authors have written books that will never sell more than the \"50-100 copies to your friends & family\" minimum threshold. Those authors deserve a voice; they can start a blog. It's not a good investment of time and money for a publisher to try to publish them.\n\nIt looks like a vanity press on the PublishAmerica model, which means they don't charge you money up front (although there might be a lot of \"optional\" services you can pay for). Instead, they use print-on-demand and ebook publishing so that they don't have to invest much money up front, they do the bare minimum for editing and cover design, and - they can make a profit off any writer who gets their friends and family to buy 50 or 100 copies. Best case scenario, the author buys a LOT of copies to hand-sell. \n\nIt doesn't mean anything that the books are on the Barnes & Noble web site; the B&N website has everything that's available from whatever huge book distributor they use (I forget if it's Ingram or Baker & Taylor).

It was incredibly isolating to be LGBTQ+ in an age when the internet didn't exist and the very few gay characters in the media were portrayed as evil or as punchlines. Before printers and copiers, before large presses were willing to print gay-themed books or magazines... you could subscribe to a mimeographed newsletter. If you were in the know. If you didn't live in a major city, if you didn't have friends who were gay, you might never even know such a thing existed. It's really hard to organize if you're closeted and a lot of the people who might be your allies are closeted. It's really hard to organize if you've internalized the messages everywhere around you that it's a sin and a perversion to be gay. \n\nSecond, AIDS. Towards the late 70s and early 80s, things WERE getting better, especially in major cities. And then people started dying, and that definitely fueled a lot of religious-right rhetoric about AIDS as a punishment for sin. (On top of which, it's really hard to organize when your friends are dying). There are also ways in which AIDS galvanized activism - I think the movement for legal recognition of same-sex partnerships was strengthened by the obvious injustice of people losing their apartments upon their partner's death or being unable to visit their partner in the hospital - but mostly it was a really traumatic thing to go through for the LGBTQ+ community, and it made being gay seem terrifying (even threatening) to people outside that community.\n\nI would recommend, if you're curious, reading lgbtq+ writers from that time period.

What I will say is that non-black people who have grown up with AAVE generally have a pretty good sense of how their speech is going to be perceived by the black people around them, and people who speak AAVE generally have a pretty good sense of when a person is speaking in their dialect as opposed to caricaturing their dialect, because most people who borrow features of AAVE in order to make fun of it *aren't very good at it*.\n\n>\\-**Following up with the first question, what exactly is code-switching?

(Some black people just didn't grow up with AAVE; some did, but are good at code-switching, and know they're going to have better luck with job interviews if they don't 'sound black' on the telephone.)\n\nThere's also kind of an implication that AAVE is something genetic, something biological, when (like all dialects) it's cultural - and has a lot to do with the history of de jure and de facto segregation in the US.\n\n>isn\u2019t it still dehumanizing to appropriate, say, a British or Australian accent for humor as you are presenting their language as a non-legitimate form of English?\n\nI don't think that all uses of putting on an accent for humor are presenting their language as a non-legitimate form of English. Many are! A lot of people use a southern American accent as a marker of uneducated or unintelligent people, and that's dehumanizing.\n\nI'm Canadian, and most of the time when Americans do Canadian accents, it's not to present Canadians or Canadian English in a bad light, it's just - 'the way they talk is different and that's amusing.' There's no power differential there, there's no history of oppression, I find that pretty harmless. (They're not very good at it, but still, pretty harmless.) On the other hand - within Canadian English, people often make fun of the way people from Newfoundland talk, and people from Newfoundland get stereotyped as poor and unintelligent.

The provocation in her eyes increased his amusement\u2014he had not supposed she would waste her powder on such small game; but perhaps she was only keeping her hand in; or perhaps a girl of her type had no conversation but of the personal kind. At any rate, she was amazingly pretty, and he had asked her to tea and must live up to his obligations.\n\nAnd exposition of background information:\n\n> Mr. Gryce's interest in Americana had not originated with himself: it was impossible to think of him as evolving any taste of his own. An uncle had left him a collection already noted among bibliophiles; the existence of the collection was the only fact that had ever shed glory on the name of Gryce, and the nephew took as much pride in his inheritance as though it had been his own work. Indeed, he gradually came to regard it as such, and to feel a sense of personal complacency when he chanced on any reference to the Gryce Americana. Anxious as he was to avoid personal notice, he took, in the printed mention of his name, a pleasure so exquisite and excessive that it seemed a compensation for his shrinking from publicity. \n\nThere's almost none in Ulysses - exposition is so compressed and omitted as to be deeply perplexing to many readers. \n\nIn Dubliners, I think, we see something much closer to a contemporary novelistic narration, that includes some amount of exposition but buries it quite deeply in the viewpoint character's consciousness.\n\n> There was no hope for him this time: it was the third stroke.

He had often said to me: \u201cI am not long for this world,\u201d and I had thought his words idle. Now I knew they were true. Every night as I gazed up at the window I said softly to myself the word paralysis. It had always sounded strangely in my ears, like the word gnomon in the Euclid and the word simony in the Catechism. But now it sounded to me like the name of some maleficent and sinful being.

It doesn\u2019t become a story until the last paragraph, where Johnson makes an amazing move.** Mirroring the chronological liberties of the opening paragraph, he leaps forward: \u201cSome years later, one time when I was admitted to the Detox at Seattle General Hospital, I took the same tack.\u201d Fuckhead goes on to describe the voices that are speaking to him in the room, and the lush hallucinations that appear before his eyes, as a \u201cbeautiful nurse\u201d gives him an injection.  \n>  \n>By the end of the story, then, we glimpse the narrator\u2019s eventual descent into drug-fueled insanity, and we get a clue to the reason he\u2019s been able to write about these events with such clarity. The story is a description of \u201cthe pity of a person\u2019s life on this earth\u201d as well as a testimonial of redemption, without any sentimentality or even the prospect of permanence. That \u201cone time when I was admitted to the Detox\u201d suggests that it happened more than once. The narrator\u2019s recovery, which allows him to relate these events, doesn\u2019t absolve him of his heartlessness during them or bring the dead people back to life. That\u2019s the meaning of \u201ckilled forever.\u201d Sobriety and sanity, precious as they are, do not compensate for the tragic senselessness of life. Redemption is glorious and it isn\u2019t nearly enough. It saves only one person at a time, and the world is full of people.\n\nWhat I would say in a more general way is this:  most stories are about \"how the things the happen affect someone in pursuit of a difficult goal, and how that person changes internally as a result.\" But in the 20th century, you start to see more pushback against that definition, especially with literary fiction, and especially with short stories. Postmodern short stories - something like [The School by Donald Barthelme](https://legacy.npr.org/programs/death/readings/stories/bart.html) \\- purposefully want to mess around with our idea about what a story should look like. And I think even a lot of more traditional writers felt that that formula of the story as a moment of change was cheap or exhausted or played out - and it's *really hard* to write a good short story that fits that pattern of pursuing a difficult goal and changing internally as a result! If you look at post-1950 literary short stories, I'd say there are actually relatively few that fit that definition in a simple and straightforward way. \n\nSometimes the change happens in the reader - we understand a situation one way at the beginning of the story, and by the end, our understanding changes.\n\nSometimes the story is about the refusal of change - there's a moment when it looks like the character might change, but then they don't. \n\nI tend to agree with Eugenides that if it's *just* a snapshot of what it's like to be this particular person in this particular place and time, it's not a story. There should be *some* kind of change - even if it's just subtextual implied change, where our main character isn't necessarily changed by the car crash, but there is something - maybe a lot of small things - that take him from the person he was in the car crash to the person who is narrating this story. But I don't doubt that there are experimental writers out there proving me wrong!\n\nIn general, novels stick closer to that traditional definition of a story than short stories, because you have enough room to depict growth and change. And literary fiction hews less to that traditional definition than genre fiction - you can try to write a mystery where they don't solve the murder, but people will definitely get mad at you! \n\nBy the way, that definition of a story as being about \"how the things the happen affect someone in pursuit of a difficult goal, and how that person changes internally as a result\" doesn't mention an antagonist. You very much don't need an antagonist.

They can help a lot not just with grammar and vocabulary but how to structure an essay, how to make sure you're providing evidence for your ideas, things like that.

I wouldn't call their writing flowery, but I certainly wouldn't call it minimalist!\n\nSo I don't think it's the case that MFA programs are turning out one specific formulaic style of writer. (Maybe they did in the 80s, I dunno.) I do think that if you get an MFA, you're going to get exposed to a fair amount of that kind of stripped-down writing, and some people will imitate it because it resonates with them, and some people will imitate it because they haven't  fully developed their own style yet, and some people will imitate it because they think it's what they're supposed to write - but there is a *lot* of room for writers to develop their own styles (and I say that based on my own experiences in an MFA program as well as what I've heard from other people who've done MFAs).", "created_utc": "1611032954.0", "edited": "False", "id": "gjstjew", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_l0cet2", "parent_id": "t3_l0cet2", "score": "19", "subreddit": "AskLiteraryStudies", "subreddit_id": "t5_2tltc"}, {"author": "Fillanzea", "body": "Corinne Duyvis is an autistic YA author with several books out.", "created_utc": "1611019826.0", "edited": "False", "id": "gjs5one", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_l071fr", "parent_id": "t3_l071fr", "score": "11", "subreddit": "YAwriters", "subreddit_id": "t5_2vtil"}, {"author": "Fillanzea", "body": "Every good book you read is full of ideas about solving problems that you'll encounter when you write. And I think that we're poorer if the only tools we have in our toolbox are the ones used by writers of our own generation. \n\nIt's the same with reading literature in translation - very often, it's when I read books in translation that I expand my ideas of what writing can do, or how novels can be structured. \n\nI think it's helpful, too, to have a solid knowledge of what literary history looks like, how styles changed and why, and you can get some of this from reading theory but you can't get a real feel for it without actually reading the books themselves. I don't personally like Hemingway very much, but because I've read him, and I've read the writers he was rebelling against, and I've read the writers he influenced, I have a much better idea of the kinds of things you can achieve with both maximalism *and* minimalism.\n\nThe last thing I'll say is that it's important to think about why certain books are canonized as 'classics.' The books you get taught in high school, especially, are not taught in high school because they're the best books (insofar as you can even make judgments about that.) They're books that give a representative idea of literary history, lend themselves to certain kinds of analysis, can be used to talk about social/historical themes, and can be taught in the context of a high school classroom. And mostly, they're books that were canonized as 'classics' fifty years ago, or more, and that introduced a certain amount of bias. *Middlemarch* is one of the best novels of Victorian England, and I think George Eliot is a much better prose writer than Charles Dickens. But it's also *three hundred thousand words long* (that's a Moby-Dick and a half!), so of course it doesn't get taught in high schools. American high school students read almost no writing that's not American or British - we miss out on Balzac and Stendhal and the Russians. I think the 'classics' that *writers* would choose are not the 'classics' that high school English teachers would choose.
