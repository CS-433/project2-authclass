Clint was the first person who really gave it to her straight, to put it plainly. He told her that she could either continue to beat herself up over allying with a genocidal robot that\u2019s trying to wipe out humanity by dropping a city from the sky\u2026or she can realise that she can apologise for her actions by doing her best to improve the situation and save as many people as possible. He told her to take matters into her own hands and make her own decision, and that\u2019s how she joined the Avengers.\n\nThen, in Civil War, she was basically being held hostage at the compound after the incident in Lagos, where her split-second decision to save peoples\u2019 lives on the ground ended up causing the loss of peoples\u2019 lives in the hospital. We move from the dynamic of choices being made in order to save innocent lives to a dynamic of decisions resulting in loss in every outcome, despite your best actions or intentions. This was a very important moment for Wanda\u2019s development; she aligned with the heroes because she thought that good actions would lead to her redemption. This is important especially in the context that she was now fighting alongside the very person responsible for her parents\u2019 death, which was the pivotal moment that changed the trajectory of her and Pietro\u2019s lives moving onward. Clint, again, showed up and reminded her that waiting idly for her mess to be cleaned up by others does nothing to improve her image and that though the past can\u2019t be changed, she can work towards the future she wants. She gets off of her ass (so to speak) and fights for what she believes in, thanks to her mentor.\n\nAnd even at the end of Endgame, Clint and Wanda were able to come together at the funeral and talk about the very personal and permanent losses they both faced. Clint lost his best friend and a close partner-in-crime, if you will, and Wanda lost the love of her life to Thanos after she already blew his head up in the first place. Clint was there to see her throughout the entire saga, and I really think that he would\u2019ve been one of the select few people that could\u2019ve done anything to get through to Wanda.\n\nI say that because Clint didn\u2019t lose family. In fact, that\u2019s what he regained by the end of Endgame, since his family wasn\u2019t permanently lost. However, at this point, Wanda\u2019s entire nuclear family and the love of her life are all dead and unable to be resurrected (without the use of her Chaos magic, which had limitations due to her lack of knowledge). My biggest concern would be that she would take it very personally that Clint was able to have his happy ending, more or less, while she still had nothing to show for all of the effort and heartbreak she had put in and gone through over the 8 in-universe years (only 3 of which she directly experienced, thanks to the Blip).

So far, though, she is the only character who can _physically_ cross the barrier between universes, and that is why she is important in this movie, because...\n\n> How was Wanda casting and summoning in other Universes without dreamwalking, and why did she need to dreamwalk if she could do all of that?\n\nWanda can't physically move between universes herself, and it seems that without a host vessel, she cannot do much in the way of casting magic across universal boundaries. As such, she uses the Darkhold to summon and bind demons who _can_ cross universal borders to capture and retrieve her so that she can take Ch\u00e1vez's powers and cross the Multiverse herself.\n\n> Why did the Illuminati kill their Strange if he posed no more threat and helped save their universe?\n\nStrange caused an Incursion in a different universe that he dreamwalked into; he did not save his own universe from one, nor did he save either of the two universes that collapsed as a result. He also did not save his universe from Thanos; the remaining members of the Illuminati stated that they found the Book of Vishanti and used it. Strange was still possessed by the Darkhold (as shown by the witch markings on his fingers) and couldn't be trusted not to act out of Chthon's influence, and as punishment for going behind the back of the Council he created (and to prevent him from possibly causing an Incursion in his own reality), he was executed.\n\n> How was 838 studying and classifying universes, if they had no way of accessing them?\n\nIt's not explicitly mentioned how they classified Earth-616 or how much prior knowledge they had of the Multiverse or its travelers/breachers. However, since they were able to find the Book of Vishanti, they ultimately had learned of the Multiverse's existence and were able to travel it in order to find the book. As a result, they were likely able to study and interact with other universes, similar to how Kang mentioned in Loki that he was able to communicate with his variants once his universe became sufficiently technologically advanced. This is not too surprising, considering they had Reed Richards.\n\n> How did Blackbolt\u2019s scream not just blow open a hole where his mouth was?\n\nWanda could have just made his skin thick enough to withstand the sonic blast, forcing it to rebound through his skull. Reality manipulation and all that shizz; the power lets you through conventional science out of the window.\n\n> How did Captain Carter last more than 3 seconds in that fight?\n\nThe entire fight was just plot, as she very well could have atomised them all, just like she did with the young sorcerer at Kamar-Taj; however, she let them have their superhero landings, their little rally-to-the-good-side spiel, etc. Captain Carter also got lucky with slipping into the shadows for a second, which gave her some time. Wanda was probably toying with her a bit (or could have hesitated because of her relationship with Steve since Civil War) and decided she was done playing.\n\n> Why didn\u2019t Wanda just suck out all the sorcerers's \\[sic\\] powers if she could do it to Captain Marvel?\n\nShe could have depowered them or otherwise absorbed their powers, sure. But none of their powers give her any benefit or ability that Chaos magic doesn't already provide.\n\n> Why wasn\u2019t the 838 Wanda able to put up more of a fight when being possessed?(I understand her eventually losing since she\u2019s not a fully realized Scarlet Witch)\n\nShe never met Agatha, and she never had the Darkhold. As such, she never had any formal training on her powers (aside from \"learn how to aim your energy blasts and use your psionic abilities\"), and she never learned that they were actually magic. Assuming she created her kids using Chaos magic (since Vision doesn't exist and she's a single mother), then she did it unknowingly and wasn't aware of how to replicate or control the most important part of her powerset. She also settled for being the domestic mom, so she didn't have much reason to study her powers in-depth.\n\n> How did Wong survive that fall?\n\nPlot, and probably because sorcerers may have higher durability? I'm leaning more toward the former since, allegedly, he was scheduled to die in the original script(s).\n\n> How was Wanda able to destroy every Darkhold in every Universe? How was she able to destroy the Vishanti so easily? \\[...\\] Why is there only one Vishanti in the multiverse, but one Darkhold in every universe?\n\nThat's been a question I've discussed a few times, and at this point, we only have speculation. The first question is more readily answerable but is dependent on the theory that all copies of the Darkhold are somehow intrinsically linked: she used the Darkhold's connection to its Multiversal copies and destroyed them, one by one. The second one is less easily answered; there is only one copy of the Book of Vishanti in the comics, and it is the antithesis of the true Darkhold. The former contains information on order/\"white\" magic (spells on defense, healing, restoration, protection, etc.; no spells can be used in an offensive capability), and the latter information on dark/\"black\" magic. Every spell in one is the opposite of the corresponding spell in the other, and to maintain balance, destroying one spell requires the destruction of the other. This is where it becomes murky; destroying the Book of Vishanti should have destroyed the true Darkhold in the MCM. If it did, then every version of the Darkhold we've seen so far was a copy, which is likely why they were much easier to actually destroy. However, where was the real Darkhold, then? It's not really Mount Wundagore, per se; even though the spells in the Darkhold were inscribed upon the walls, they were only a section of the final, finished Darkhold that would come to exist. They were just the spells that Chthon had recorded himself, being probably the first and most proficient user of Chaos magic.\n\n> Where\u2019s the TVA and those trying to keep order in the Multiverse when all of this is happening?\n\nWho knows? It's not sure where the end of Loki occurs on the timeline, since the branching of the timeline and the opening of the Multiverse occurred outside of normal spacetime. MoM happens in 2025, but seeing as it was in the works alongside NWH (with both being rewritten multiple times), it's hard knowing right now where everything stands. It's not sure if Kang had already infiltrated the TVA by the time MoM happens.\n\n> Where TF did the minotaur come from???\n\nThat's Rintrah, who was surprisingly not mentioned by name. This was also likely due to script reworking. In the comics, he trained under Enitharmon the Weaver, who was approached by Strange to fix his Cloak of Levitation. Ultimately, Rintrah would become Strange's apprentice and study the Mystic Arts under his tutelage, and he eventually becomes a professor at his academy, teaching students how to apply algebra and geometry to creating illusions.", "created_utc": "1655956165.0", "edited": "1655957114.0", "id": "ide2dvl", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_vimgkw", "parent_id": "t3_vimgkw", "score": "20", "subreddit": "multiverseofmadness", "subreddit_id": "t5_21p263"}, {"author": "eightbitsushiroll", "body": "Neanche io, penso che morirei se ne trovassi un chromatico maschio", "created_utc": "1655935224.0", "edited": "False", "id": "idcv7ue", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_vi3vhb", "parent_id": "t1_idcfnby", "score": "1", "subreddit": "ShinyPokemon", "subreddit_id": "t5_2se9w"}, {"author": "eightbitsushiroll", "body": "There\u2019s no telling if it\u2019s really fire or just an energy bolt of Eldritch magic (which is what my guess is, considering the arrows also seem to be magic as well).", "created_utc": "1655926291.0", "edited": "False", "id": "idcag1b", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_vi8mm7", "parent_id": "t3_vi8mm7", "score": "21", "subreddit": "multiverseofmadness", "subreddit_id": "t5_21p263"}, {"author": "eightbitsushiroll", "body": "Sorry sweaty, I\u2019ll get started on having someone ghostwrite my YouTube apology video", "created_utc": "1655872287.0", "edited": "False", "id": "id9nk9k", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_vhuvwm", "parent_id": "t1_id9jm0o", "score": "26", "subreddit": "conlangs", "subreddit_id": "t5_2red7"}, {"author": "eightbitsushiroll", "body": "Found it here just by searching the \u201clenguas iberorromances\u201d at the bottom of the image: https://commons.m.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Lenguas_y_dialectos_iberorromances.PNG\n\nHowever, it doesn\u2019t have the legend on it, either.

This isn\u2019t surprising information, for she created her children herself in the comics using the magic from the New Saelem witches (and, unknowingly, Mephisto). It\u2019s also very possible she just created her kids in Westview by herself and used the little \u201cfrisky time\u201d scene with Vision as a time-appropriate explanation and justification for her pregnancy.\n\nAs to why she couldn\u2019t create her children again, well\u2026that\u2019s a question we all have. I think that it might not be possible for her to recreate Billy and Tommy exactly as they were. The Vision she created was like the original Vision in many ways (appearance, personality, powers, composition, etc.), but he had limitations; he didn\u2019t have the memories his original had, no recollection of the life and the precious moments he and Wanda shared before his creation. I don\u2019t know if Wanda would be willing to compromise with having her children possibly come out differently than they used to be\u2014maybe their personalities are slightly off, or their powers either don\u2019t manifest or do so differently, etc. There\u2019s no telling how many universes she\u2019s seen, or how many variations of Billy and Tommy she\u2019s watched, but she settled on a universe where they still lived their Westview life, so maybe she\u2019s hyperfixating on recreating her suburban mom life from WandaVision as closely as she can? I mean, to be fair, the Darkhold doesn\u2019t allow much room for rationality and logical thinking.\n\nAs for Quicksilver, it\u2019s super possible he survived in other universes! It\u2019s highly improbable that he died in every one of them! He just wasn\u2019t her focus.

It just happens that each attempt was cut off fairly quickly, so neither got an attempt to steal all of her powers (and she could thus probably regenerate, or recharge, what she lost).\n5) I don\u2019t know if Wanda really is dead or not.

There were some plot points regarding reincarnations of the Multiverse that make Earth-616 a focal point of sorts of the Multiverse, but I think that they tie into the idea of it being the \u201cmain\u201d one because it\u2019s the most developed one. Even though both Mysterio and Christine said that the Earth in the MCU universe throughout the Infinity Saga is referred to as Earth-616, there\u2019s no telling yet whether or not it\u2019s true; the 2008 Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A to Z, Vol. 5 said that the MCU takes place in Earth-199999, so we have yet to find out which is \u201ccorrect.\u201d\n\nI specifically think Wanda intentionally destroyed every Darkhold copy _before_ destroying the Mt.

With this movie specifically focusing on Dr. Strange AND Wanda\u2014two of my favourite characters\u2014I\u2019ve been practically dying in wait ever since the end of WandaVision and again when the first trailer dropped during NWH\u2019s post-credit scene.\n\nSeeing so many TV spots and teasers come out, all revealing new scenes and yet giving away so little of how the movie is expected to go, I don\u2019t really know how to make heads or tails of it all lol. I\u2019ve stayed about a mile away from every plot leak just because I don\u2019t want to ruin the experience at all. But I guess I can throw in a few predictions?\n\n\u2022 The scene with the orchard and the little house, where Wanda was tending to a tree. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if she used runes to protect the area and make it impossible for magical ambushes to happen in her little bubble, since she would\u2019ve probably learned from Agatha swooping in and ruining her fantasy reality in the Hex\u2014even if it was responsible for holding Westview hostage. This gives her a safer space to study the Darkhold, if she\u2019s continued to do that between the WandaVision episode 9 post-credits scene and MoM, and I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if the runes protected her from the effects of Strange\u2019s spell in NWH; it would be a really fun way to get Wanda and Peter together on screen, which both actors expressed wanting to happen in interviews before. :)\n\n\u2022 The scene with Dr. Strange and what seems like the Darkhold, where he\u2019s surrounded by red energy. I\u2019m guessing he\u2019s channeling Chaos magic through the book in order to figure out what\u2019s happening with the Multiverse, but if it _is_ Chaos magic, I\u2019m not sure how I feel about it. The Scarlet Witch isn\u2019t the only user of Chaos magic, not even in the comics; Luminous ended up being able to not only use it but _control_ it, too. But unless the use of Chaos magic through the Darkhold comes with a penalty that deters Strange from using it (or it basically bites him in the ass later for having used it), then it feels like it would cheapen the significance of Wanda\u2019s ascent to the Scarlet Witch in WandaVision.\n\n\u2022 I was so happy to see Billy and Tommy again! Since Kate was introduced in Hawkeye, I really want to know if this movie will set up the Young Avengers, maybe with an older Billy and Tommy from another universe? I\u2019m basically just super hyped to see all of the multiversal WandaVision rubble that Wanda\u2019s going to dig through to find her kids.", "created_utc": "1651168322.0", "edited": "False", "id": "i6k7225", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_uduxqe", "parent_id": "t3_uduxqe", "score": "2", "subreddit": "multiverseofmadness", "subreddit_id": "t5_21p263"}, {"author": "eightbitsushiroll", "body": "I think I saw somewhere that the WandaVision jingle was going to play during a scene with Wanda, so it would be really cool to at least see a cameo of her as Agnes pop up.
