This is gonna sound so fucking corny but you need to listen to this Hannah Montana song that I have on one of my playlists, it\u2019s called \u201cnobody\u2019s perfect\u201d, and you might feel a little goofy but I\u2019m 29 and it has become my anthem, and seeing as were nearly the same age you might already be familiar with it. This song reminds me that we\u2019re all human and nobody\u2019s infallible and it takes so much work to get things right and even then they go haywire sometimes. There\u2019s also a book I recommend for you called \u201cMindset: the new psychology of success; how we can learn to fulfill our potential\u201d by carol s. Dweck phd. This book completely changed the way I think about growth and failure and I\u2019d recommend it to anyone trying to improve a skill. \n\nI just wanna remind you too that you\u2019re doing great. You\u2019re almost 30 and you have the desire to learn cooking and that\u2019s very ambitious and good that you want to develop your skills. There\u2019s plenty of people that never learn to cook even into old age, and here you are knowing that you want to develop this so that you can cook for yourself while you\u2019re still so young and have so much time to learn and refine the skills you\u2019ll learn. The one thing about learning is that you actually learn best when you fail. When everything goes smoothly you never really are pushed to get creative and problem solve and you can become stagnant. So look at your failures as opportunities, not as something to beat yourself up about. \n\nFor me I know how to cook a lot of things but that is because I was neglected as a child and had to fend for myself and even knowing the things I know, I still find cooking meat very difficult and something I avoid. I shop at target and buy the precooked cold chicken and use that to incorporate into other foods I cook and that helps me from a time, dirty dishes, food safety standpoint. Even I don\u2019t know how to make schnitzel so take the little victories as they come and don\u2019t beat yourself up about the setbacks, and give yourself the credit you deserve. \n\nYou might not have someone to learn from but you have the infinite resources of the internet and you have us! You can message me any time if you have any specific questions or just need someone to vent to, alright. Don\u2019t give up, just keep cracking away at it. And when you do cook something you\u2019re satisfied with, share it with us!

THUMP  \nUsually a downward type of physical contact usually with an object but sometimes with your hand. Kind of has a dull hollow sound, you might thump somebody on the head, it\u2019s not really intended to hurt the person but to discourage them\n02. HIT  \nThis is usually with the intention to hurt someone. Has more of a louder sound of contact than a thump and also a hit usually comes from the same height as where the contact is made, as opposed to the high to low downward motion of a thump. Hitting is generally with open hand\n03. PUNCH  \nPunch is forceful contact from knuckles of a closed fist, intended to hurt and makes noise, like hitting it is usually from same height but can come from other swings such as uppercut or hook. Can do a bit more damage than a hit depending where it is done. In a boxing match you should see only punching as opposed to the others on this list. \n04. STRIKE  \nStrike can refer to any contact intended to harm, but it also refers to things such as missiles in war (missile strike) and an attack by a snake, and there are more meanings I\u2019m probably forgetting right now. Oh also lightning is referred to as a strike, and people quitting temporarily to negotiate as a team, a strike\n05. SLAP  \nSlaps usually are with an open hand and force to hit across the face. Slap is a specific type of hitting and makes a loud noise and is a bit dramatic and something you\u2019d see in a dramatic tv show \n06. POUND  \nPounding can be a way to refer to punching, but also like when you listen to electronic music you can pound the air along with the music, there\u2019s a Nicki Minaj song called \u201cPound the Alarm\u201d which doesn\u2019t make much sense but it gives a better idea of the vibe of pounding. Also if your heart is beating fast you can say your heart is pounding \n07. SMACK  \nSmack is kind of like slap but more pushy with the force coming from your palm more by your wrist whereas slap is more even contact from wrist to fingertips and slap is more to sting as a feeling whereas smack hurts too but a more dull quick pain where a slap could hurt for longer. Smack is more often a downward or upward motion (you can smack someone \u201cupside their head\u201d) and slap is usually from right to left or vice versa. \n08. WHACK  \nWhacking is not usually as violent as a hit, does technically fall under a strike, but it can be playful and with an object, for example \u201cshe whacked me with a pillow but it didn\u2019t hurt\u201d.

I will make corrections below based on the particular English that I speak as a native speaker in the USA, I hope it\u2019s helpful for you. I\u2019ll mark my version with a flag\n\n\n1. \u201cPlease put your dirty clothes in the hamper, I\u2019ll do the (washing-up / laundry) later\u201d  -> by laundry and washing-up I mean the clothes that have just been washed\n\n\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 \u201cPlease put your dirty clothes/laundry in the hamper, I\u2019ll put them in the wash later.\u201d If the clothes are already washed, \u201cI\u2019ll fold and put away the clothes later\u201d, I just wasn\u2019t sure at what point your laundry was at, if it was washed or not, just hoping to cover all bases for you. \n\n2. \u201cWhen you\u2019re in the shop bring me a (washing-up liquid / dishwashing liquid)\u201d -> are these both valid? It\u2019s not the pod that goes in the dishwasher but the bottle with the liquid instead.\n\n\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 \u201cWhen you\u2019re at the store get me some dishwasher liquid/detergent.\u201d In the states we tend to use shop more as a verb than a noun, though you will hear it, just not as often as \u201cstore/grocery store\u201d. Dishwashing liquid is also technically correct, but dishwasher liquid seems a more casual/easy/natural way to say it. Not to be confused with dish soap, which is a different liquid to wash dishes by hand, not in the dishwasher. \n\n\n3. \u201cThis (hand soap / liquid soap) smells so nice\u201d -> the liquid we use to wash our hands.\n\n\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 \u201cThis hand soap smells so nice\u201d, even though it is a liquid soap, saying \u201chand soap\u201d distinguishes it from other types of liquid soap like dish soap or laundry soap. \n\n\n4. \u201cSoaps are quite cheap these days\u201d -> by soap here I mean the hard block of soap that is becoming less common nowadays \n\n\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 \u201c(Soap is / bars of soap are) quite cheap (nowadays/ these days)\u201d you have some options here, but it\u2019s important to keep soap as a singular not plural unless you specifically want to refer to the \u201cbars\u201d of soap, then they can be plural\n\n\n5. \u201cI have to unload the washing machine and hang up the (wash / laundry)\u201d -> similar to 1. I know that hang up implies draping them on a clothes line. If that\u2019s correct, what would the verb for drying them be? \u201cI\u2019ll move them to the drier to dry them off\u201d?\n\n\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 \u201cI have to unload the washer and hang the clothes out to dry\u201d washing machine is also correct but we like to shorten some stuff. If you\u2019re using a drier (the preferred method in the USA haha), I\u2019d say \u201cI\u2019m putting the wash in the drier\u201d and anything else is a little redundant \n\nI hope this helps!

Some time in high school I began studying Arabic and this led me to an opportunity studying abroad in Jordan. I came back afterwards and finished high school, then continued Arabic at university, completely convinced I would make a career out of it, even to the extent I would regularly travel to DC for job fairs, model Arab league conferences etc. \n\nSome time after graduation I realized I have no concept of how to turn my education into a career, and I was overwhelmed by my dead end retail jobs and at some point I even tried to work at a call center, and the lowest point was making $7.50 at sears (post-degree). All of these jobs caused me so much anxiety but I thought it was inherent mental health issues, when in reality I knew almost nothing about my autism and how it affects my ability to interact socially in these settings. \n\nGradually I\u2019d recoil more and more at the idea of working closely with others and constantly interacting with customers and at some point I left retail entirely. I wanted to find something new and completely different. It was well into the pandemic and I thought it\u2019s about time for me to go back to some sort of work and I was on the bus downtown, mystified at all the tall fancy hotels. I was looking at the windows, trying to count the rooms. It occurred to me, damn there are so many rooms, I bet there are so many housekeepers to clean all those rooms. My imagination pondered what it must be like to be a housekeeper, and it almost sounded kind of cool. Pushing a cart of linens and toiletries around, and working alone to clean the rooms for the day. It almost sounded a little romantic in my head, it sounded like just what I needed. I was fantasizing about being around all the wealthy tourists and businesspeople and soaking up all the affluence. \n\nI applied and got the job and it was very hard because I was trained in Spanish and going from 14 months with no job to a highly physically demanding job was quite a transition, plus I\u2019m a white Mexican so I felt a little like the odd one out, there are difficulties navigating the social aspect of the job (lot of gossip and sometimes coworkers steal things off others carts). \n\nSo it\u2019s far from perfect but it works for me. I did try to quit once, this time last year, because I had so many intrusive thoughts that I didn\u2019t belong there, and that I should be working doing something related to my education. I had to wrestle with a lot of feelings of shame and embarrassment, and for months I wouldn\u2019t tell my extended family what type of work I was doing, because they\u2019re all NT and I didn\u2019t expect them to understand my motivations. I still dream of someday breaking into my field but the reality is I\u2019m 6 years removed from the Arabic proficiency I had when I graduated from uni and the longer I drift, the harder it is to steer the ship that way. \n\nTLDR; I got a degree in my passion but now I work as a hotel housekeeper and I don\u2019t make much money but I\u2019m steadily paying my debts, ensuring my benefits and respecting my social limitations", "created_utc": "1661119084.0", "edited": "False", "id": "il8v2f3", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_wu9a1w", "parent_id": "t3_wu9a1w", "score": "14", "subreddit": "AutismInWomen", "subreddit_id": "t5_3yx96k"}, {"author": "cricketjust4luck", "body": "There might be an error there, I always have seen it written as \u201c\u0627\u0644\u0633\u0644\u0627\u0645\u064f \u0639\u0644\u064a\u0643\u0645\" \n\nFor the cinema example the distinction is because in that word, the end letter is a long vowel, if it were spelled with a short vowel it would be \u0633\u064a\u0646\u0645\u064e but that would be a misspelling/mispronounced that way", "created_utc": "1661118068.0", "edited": "False", "id": "il8soyo", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_wu9zi6", "parent_id": "t1_il8s7d6", "score": "3", "subreddit": "learn_arabic", "subreddit_id": "t5_2v4vi"}, {"author": "cricketjust4luck", "body": "\u0644\u0627 is just \u0644+\u0627  which is the word no \n\n\u0629 is at the end of feminine nouns\n\n\nThe last one I don\u2019t know what you mean can you give an example?", "created_utc": "1661117284.0", "edited": "False", "id": "il8qu85", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_wu9zi6", "parent_id": "t3_wu9zi6", "score": "2", "subreddit": "learn_arabic", "subreddit_id": "t5_2v4vi"}, {"author": "cricketjust4luck", "body": "When I consume a lot of Spanish content or when my phone picks up Spanish being spoken in its vicinity I get naturally fed more Spanish ads and content in the algorithms, if boosting that doesn\u2019t help I don\u2019t know what will", "created_utc": "1661117026.0", "edited": "False", "id": "il8q8d4", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_wu92xc", "parent_id": "t3_wu92xc", "score": "2", "subreddit": "Spanish", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qtt1"}, {"author": "cricketjust4luck", "body": "I never really use the word awaited unless I\u2019m being weird and dramatic like if I\u2019m like oh the long awaited burger is now in front of me but otherwise I never need that word.

This had led to intimacy issues in terms of me being unromantic and only sexual even before I was an adult and when I eventually unlearned that it flipped dramatically to lack of sex drive and asexuality.
