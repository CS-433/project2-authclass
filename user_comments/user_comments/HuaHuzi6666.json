We get that much from Tacitus and Josephus. Beyond that we know pretty much nothing with historical certainty.\n\n\nIF we decide to suspend questions about the historical fact or lack thereof for the NT, regarding the socialisty-ness of the character Jesus the Christ as portrayed in the NT (all translations NRSV): \n\n\nMatthew 19:23-24: Then Jesus said to his disciples, \u201cTruly I tell you, it will be hard for a rich person to enter the kingdom of heaven. | Again I tell you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God.\u201d [takeaway: preferential option for the poor, disdain for the rich.]\n\n\nMatthew 21:12: Then Jesus entered the temple and drove out all who were selling and buying in the temple, and he overturned the tables of the money changers and the seats of those who sold doves. [takeaway: disregard for/destruction of private property, and disruption of rent-seeking behaviors; given that inviolability of private property is a cornerstone of capitalism I'd also label this one socialisty.]\n\n\nLuke 6:20-21, 24-25: Then he looked up at his disciples and said: \u201cBlessed are you who are poor, for yours is the kingdom of God. Blessed are you who are hungry now, for you will be filled. Blessed are you who weep now, for you will laugh. [...] But woe to you who are rich, for you have received your consolation. Woe to you who are full now, for you will be hungry. Woe to you who are laughing now, for you will mourn and weep.\" [takeaway: again, preferential option for the poor].\n\n\nLuke 6:29-30: [...] from anyone who takes away your coat do not withhold even your shirt. Give to everyone who asks of you, and if anyone takes away what is yours, do not ask for it back again. \n\n\nMoving on now to the general socialisty-ness of early Christianity:\n\n\nJames 5:1-6: Come now, you rich people, weep and wail for the miseries that are coming to you. Your riches have rotted, and your clothes are moth-eaten. Your gold and silver have rusted, and their rust will be evidence against you, and it will eat your flesh like fire. You have laid up treasure during the last days. Listen! *The wages of the laborers who mowed your fields, which you kept back by fraud, cry out, and the cries of the harvesters have reached the ears of the Lord of hosts.* You have lived on the earth in luxury and in pleasure; you have nourished your hearts in a day of slaughter. You have condemned and murdered the righteous one, who does not resist you. [takeaway: advocating for wage laborers over capital, condemning private accumulation of wealth].\n\n\nNow, obviously Jesus was not a socialist a la Marxism (given that capitalism did not yet exist, and thus neither did the societal set-up for Marxism be applicable), BUT one could definitely argue that he was a socialist in the utopian tradition, a la Owenism or certain contemporary schools of Christian socialism. Obviously it's more complicated than free stuff = socialism, but he certainly would care about people having a social safety net/would oppose wealth hoarding, both of which a free market is notoriously bad at.", "created_utc": "1651962622.0", "edited": "False", "id": "i7qagme", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_uhg8t1", "parent_id": "t1_i7kfwxh", "score": "1", "subreddit": "AskOldPeople", "subreddit_id": "t5_2yg69"}, {"author": "HuaHuzi6666", "body": "Wait but what does any of that have to do with scavenger?", "created_utc": "1651962348.0", "edited": "False", "id": "i7q9w3m", "is_submitter": "True", "link_id": "t3_ujzhmq", "parent_id": "t1_i7njqai", "score": "1", "subreddit": "Mordhau", "subreddit_id": "t5_387za"}, {"author": "HuaHuzi6666", "body": "Wait what passive bandage pickup with scavenger is a  thing??", "created_utc": "1651907177.0", "edited": "False", "id": "i7nh8x1", "is_submitter": "True", "link_id": "t3_ujzhmq", "parent_id": "t1_i7mi0zl", "score": "1", "subreddit": "Mordhau", "subreddit_id": "t5_387za"}, {"author": "HuaHuzi6666", "body": "I thought you said you were familiar with the Bible lmao, if none of that rings a bell you REALLY have some reading to do.", "created_utc": "1651851340.0", "edited": "False", "id": "i7kdxem", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_uhg8t1", "parent_id": "t1_i7juqu9", "score": "0", "subreddit": "AskOldPeople", "subreddit_id": "t5_2yg69"}, {"author": "HuaHuzi6666", "body": "I want this but everyone has a horse, have massive cavalry charges crashing into each other.", "created_utc": "1651814134.0", "edited": "False", "id": "i7iqe4u", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_uj0x1q", "parent_id": "t3_uj0x1q", "score": "2", "subreddit": "Mordhau", "subreddit_id": "t5_387za"}, {"author": "HuaHuzi6666", "body": "Back when I was broke and paying per ride I just had a screen recording of the activated ticket screen lol", "created_utc": "1651811406.0", "edited": "False", "id": "i7im5ww", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_uj8uja", "parent_id": "t1_i7if5wj", "score": "23", "subreddit": "Minneapolis", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r3bl"}, {"author": "HuaHuzi6666", "body": ">Since I don\u2019t have a strictly materialistic worldview\n\nsoooooo we're gonna solve these problems with magic then? \n\n>You don\u2019t see how abortion has led to an increase in a multitude of social problems, including violence against women and children, child abandonment and neglect. The number one leading cause of poverty is single parents. No amount of money will ever fix the problems caused by raising children in single parent families, which is a direct consequence of the availability of abortion.\n\nUhm ma'am...let's think for a minute, what could possibly be the reason those parents are single parents? Oh wait, it's because they can't get an abortion across a lot of the country! You can try to tell people to have sex by your rules, but people have been fucking since wayyyyy before marriage was a thing, and have never really been very good at the whole \"wait till you're married\" thing. What we can do is support them once they DO have children. Mind you, I never said that mothers in committed relationships with good support networks wouldn't ALSO benefit from all the things I listed. Married couples sometimes choose to abort too, not just teenaged moms, and it's often because they can't support a baby at the moment. If we gave them said support it would *surprise* lower abortion rates. \n\n> It\u2019s not a money problem; it\u2019s a values problem.\n\nIt is a values problem, but it's conservative lawmakers' values that are the problem. They think they can use the Bible as a public policy blueprint, but *surprise* ideas written in a story from two millennia ago didn't account for today's world. Take it from someone with a Master's in Public Policy, there isn't a single serious practitioner whose solution to modern social ills is \"have better values.\" Peoples' ability to live true to their values, to a large degree, depends on material and socioeconomic factors, not on whether they *fornicate* (gasp).\n\n>What do you think is the point of Jesus\u2019s ministry here on earth? Do you think he was a socialist? That he came here to feed the poor? Did he want us to be nice to each other? He specifically said his kingdom is not of this world. He told Nicodemus he had to be born again. What do you suppose that means? Why do you suppose he was executed? Have you ever looked at the evidence for the resurrection of Jesus? Why do you suppose he needed to die and be raised from the dead? Have you ever looked at the evidence for the resurrection?\n\nActually yes, I'd argue he was essentially a proto-socialist. He was friends with sex workers, poor people, murderers, thieves, and queer folks (and was quite possibly queer himself, given that he was unmarried at 30 in that day and age and had a \"disciple whom he loved\", strongly evoking David and Jonathan), he rallied against those who monetarily exploited the poor and the workers (for Christ's sake he even destroyed private property in the market), he believed in redistributing wealth, and he was ultimately executed by the police for being the anti-imperial leader of a political movement that threatened Roman control of Palestine, along with their Temple lackeys.

Plus, those books that are out of step with the prophecies were rejected by later Church councils when making the canonical New Testament. \nAs for Paul: he did not meet the historical Jesus of Nazareth before his execution by the state. Sure Paul might have believed he had a vision of Jesus, but you just have to look at the tension between the OG disciples and Paul when he met them to recognize that his \u201cmeeting\u201d Jesus is less than historical fact.\nAs for the Trinity, sure you can interpret the OT that way if you have a shitty grasp of Biblical Hebrew; but rabbinical scholars agree that Elohim is the equivalent of the royal \u201cwe\u201d, not plural. It indicating multiple Gods would be utter blasphemy to pre-exilic Jews, just as it is today. \nAs for your last claim: #1, the Jews would like a word with you about Christianity being the \u201cmost oppressed\u201d lmao; Christianity has been an imperial faith for 1700 years, oppression my ass. #2 Ignoring momentarily that using a scriptural and prophecy-based standard is necessarily going to favor the Abrahamic religions, as other religions put less emphasis on a canonical central text (this would be like saying \u201cAmericans are the best athletes because they are the best American football players\u201d \u2014 none of the rest of the world plays it, so of course if that\u2019s your standard you\u2019re gonna come out on top), have you ever peeked at the Qur\u2019an? I don\u2019t have the numbers at hand but Muslims would argue that the Qur\u2019an fulfills more prophecies than the Bible by far, and tbh given the more unified authorship of the Qur\u2019an I\u2019d say theirs is easier to \u201cprove\u201d to be true than the Bible.

Your negative experiences, however trivial they are relative to these events, are not invalidated by them. You're perfectly able to experience suffering even if there is worse suffering elsewhere. In this game, nobody wins.\n\n2) **Cultivate compassion instead of empathy.** It will help you be more responsive to the needs of all humans, stripped of proximity and media hype. Not to minimize at all, but Afghanistan is only one place where women and children massively suffer: women and children suffer everywhere, and even this particularly concentrated instance of it isn't an anomaly (think Xinjiang, Palestine, more low-level endemic suffering everywhere else). Compassion means being aware of and sympathizing with this suffering *without* taking it on yourself. Empathy is the opposite; you aren't just aware of this suffering, but it becomes *your* suffering. Compassion has a wide lens, more able to encompass greater suffering productively; empathy has a narrow lens, focusing in on people who are familiar with us somehow to the exclusion of others, and amplifying their pain for ourselves until we're useless with emotions. I know this is easier said than done, but even the paradigm shift has helped for me.\n\n3) **Turn off the damn news. Turn off social media too if you need to.** Humans have a massive negativity bias; while it once helped us survive, media exploits it for engagement while making us feel awful in the process. **Unplug.**\n\nI know that it doesn't directly address your anxiety, but whenever I'm anxious about how awful the world seems I go back to \"Humankind: A Hopeful History\" by Rutger Bregman.

[Red Rosa](https://www.versobooks.com/books/2036-red-rosa) (Kate Evans, ed.

Also just one of my favorite books.)\n\nThere's a plethora of similar books, especially graphic biographies of giants in socialist history like Debs, Orwell, Guevara, Trotsky, Goldman, and more.

Here's why:\n\n1) I certainly know China is no more a paradise than any other country, and (after living there for a few years) would like to think I neither overly-romanticize it nor overly-criticize it.  It's a nation with its ups and downs, like any other.  Similarly, I don't dislike Chinese TV because of its quality -- that doesn't really dissuade me no matter the origin of a production.  It's more the pacing, duration, and emphasis on (to me) incredibly minute and intricate social interactions, especially in court dramas, that make it hard for me to get into.  \n\n2) I recognize that things like pacing and how shows are written are super culturally bound, and that by excluding Chinese shows that don't cater to Western tastes I'm missing out on a tooooooon of important cultural knowledge.  And that makes me sad/uncomfortable, but watching show after show that I just can't get into is neither productive for my language learning nor gives these shows the appreciation they deserve.\n\nMaybe this is a better way to think of my question: Currently, I have yet to find a Chinese show that I can get into.  I would like to find one that might have some more Western elements in how it's produced/written/etc so that I can gain a foothold to eventually learn to appreciate more traditional Chinese shows.  I have yet to find a foothold to get me into Chinese TV, precluding me from appreciating them or learning from them much at all so far.  I recognize that finding an entire catalogue of TV shows that fit this need is unrealistic, but I don't need a whole catalogue of them, just one.  I'm looking for a point of entry.  \n\nNot to use your example to literally, but it illustrates my point well: I've read all of \u897f\u6e38\u8bb0 in translation and parts in the original, and have studied Chinese history \\*in\\* China, as well as Chinese religion and philosophy in the West (China studies major for undergrad).  But despite enjoying the book, knowing the plot, and understanding (not all, but many of) the relevant cultural details, I still wasn't able to get into the classic TV show because of the pacing.  See my point here?  As a foreigner, I know I'll never get \\*everything\\* about these shows, but I'd like to find a way to get hooked so I can \\*begin\\* to learn to like these shows, with their good and bad aspects.  Thus, although my awareness is obviously not perfect, it's perhaps less of an issue than what you're reading into the situation. \n\nTL;DR: not asking for all Chinese TV to cater to my Western standards (this would be ridiculous and frankly imperialist), just looking for a slightly more Western show to get a foothold for enjoying more Chinese TV down the road.", "created_utc": "1623178892.0", "edited": "False", "id": "h128zy5", "is_submitter": "True", "link_id": "t3_nugtbb", "parent_id": "t1_h11uv01", "score": "1", "subreddit": "ChineseLanguage", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qyz1"}, {"author": "HuaHuzi6666", "body": "Yes, but you can just start it up right away after the hour is up.

HOWEVER, revolution *does not* *necessarily* mean violence. It means a revolution, or complete reorganization, of how society is structured.\n\nPersonally, I agree with you generally. In a stable society it is not only infeasible to stage a  (successful) violent revolution, but to paraphrase Herbert Marcuse: if we were to overthrow capitalism all at once tomorrow it would be a mess and everybody would be the worse for it. Capitalism should be abolished (which would constitute a societal revolution), but violent, sudden revolution is neither the only nor necessarily the preferable option. \n\nAs good ol' Karl himself said at the Hague congress of the International in 1872, \"... we do not deny that there are countries like England and America... where labour may attain its goal by peaceful means.\"\n\nFor another interesting take on what \"revolution\" means, look here: [https://www.marxists.org/history/usa/parties/spusa/1903/1000-thompson-whatrevsoc.pdf](https://www.marxists.org/history/usa/parties/spusa/1903/1000-thompson-whatrevsoc.pdf)\n\nOne must keep in mind, however, that a violent revolution is not an illegitimate way to achieve the end of abolishing capitalism. If socialists are presented with a society already on the verge of collapse or civil war, the opportunity to recast it must be seized.

It aspires to objectivity, even if it doesn't always hit the mark.  Belief, on the other hand, is 100% subjective.  Observation of God requires belief in God, which isn't a given, it requires exposure to an ideology that frames the world in this way.  For example: if I had never heard of God, I would never observe God in the world.  However, even if I had never seen a tree before, I *could* observe a tree in the world.  \n\n>By all manner, it's the very same procedure for all people who have the faith.\n\nWere that true, there wouldn't be the diversity of Christian denominations that exist (or other religions, for that matter).  Besides, everybody following the same pattern of behavior is not at all the same thing as being able do duplicate a cause-effect relationship.  If it were, we would all believe the exact same thing and faith wouldn't be faith, but fact.  In short, correlation doesn't imply causation.  \n\n> Furthermore, plenty of Christians generally follow the same \"methodology\" and all have independently verified that faith. So, it's safe to assume that those who do not have failed the \"methodology\".\n\nYou've switched cause and effect here.  Finding a different solution is not a failure of methodology.  However, if the result of an experiment isn't what one hypothesized, that doesn't mean \"oh your methodology is just wrong\".  If the solution is pre-set, then you've rendered methodology meaningless, which means that you can't empirically verify *any* solution beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\n>Do Christians not consider the Bible 100% true because they have verified it to be true? \n\nIt's impossible for *anybody* to verify the Bible.  Even if you accept that the contents are 100% true (which is itself an assumption), very few Christians can verify it because, if nothing else, they're reading a processed product.  Unless they can read Ancient Hebrew or Koine Greek, they're reading something that has already gone through multiple multiple lenses.  Yet they accept it to be true, even though they rely on what is akin to a small group of \"independent verifiers\", as you said earlier.  This mean that, since they cannot independently verify the contents and they cannot apply the scientific method to it, faith is the only justification they have.  Again, nothing wrong with that, but it's pseudo-science to try to justify it otherwise.  \n\n>Many people across thousands of years wrote of the same God who had commanded the same thing countless times. There's also the fact of the prophesies that came to pass, even the prophesies of the new Testament that are currently coming to pass.\n\nThe flaw with this is that the Bible was written in a period of time where, for statements or movements to have religious authority, they had to align with a pattern of \"prophecy\".  Take Jesus for example.  Was he actually of the house of David?  Who knows.  But because that prophecy existed, he was able to adjust his behavior in order to fit it. More often than not, revelations or prophecies come true not because they're preordained, but because they create a trope that needs to be filled.  With Jesus, again, it's indicative that there were *multiple* others who have, over the years, claimed to be the prophesied Messiah.  Why?  Because to have legitimacy as a spiritual leader, they needed to be seen as fulfilling a given prophecy and the tropes entailed.  Essentially, thus, prophecies come \"true\" because they are inherently open-ended and invite multiple takers when it comes to being \"fulfilled\".  \n\n>The bottom line is this. If you have the actual truth, no shifting of conclusions is necessary as everything else will not be the truth.\n\nThis is maybe what bugs me the most.  If a conclusion is already arrived at, then the methodology is meaningless.  If people aren't Christians because of a \"failure to replicate the methodology\", then could you not say that Christians aren't Muslims, or Jews, or Hindus, or Buddhists because they've failed to replicate the \"correct\" methodology, according to those groups?  Methodology must lead conclusions, not the other way around.  This means that conclusions, given solid methodology, should be mutable if new evidence arises.  Since Christianity does not allow for methodology to alter its conclusions, it simply cannot be said to be scientific. Which is okay, of course, but it's confirmation bias at best and grossly insincere at worst to say that Christianity and science are equally valid methods when it comes to observation of the natural world.

These \"hurdles\" aren't just inconveniences if you're working class or lower class, they're roadblocks.  \n\nI would disagree; shareholders and *employers* have aligned interest.  Because wage-labor is only another interchangeable piece of capital for employers, they function as a means to an end (i.e. profit), and only indirectly benefit from growth.  Yes, they certainly *can* benefit from investment by shareholders, but the problem lies in the fact that they are at the mercy of their employer as to *how much* they actually benefit.  Again, let's look at post-2008.  The economy has recovered in nominal terms, but most of that recovery has not gone to workers but to employers (and shareholders).  Why has it not benefitted workers?  Because employers get to dictate workers' wages and what percentage of workers' productivity is returned to them via pay.  \n\nI guess my underlying point is that, while outside capital is necessary for most businesses, the allocation of that capital by a single person or small group of people, qualified to hold their position because of their wealth, isn't just.  Why, besides being potentially less nimble , could a democratic workplace not also return investments to shareholders?  Furthermore, that would allow the workers to decide how much capital investment they must undergo, as opposed to how much they can possibly garner to milk as much profit as possible.  \n\nAs for workers taking pay cuts if investment dries up, how is this any different from how things currently operate?  \n\nI would qualifiedly disagree with the last part.  Capitalism is an  impressive and terrifyingly efficient economic system that has benefited the world greatly.  However, one of its greatest problems is that it leads to accumulation (or affluence, if you will).  Because it leads to an ever-increasing concentration of money and power, it is inherently unstable.  What socialism does isn't that it brings everyone down to 0 (I'd argue that doing this wouldn't be productive), but it limits the *range* of wealth.  It is true that, until we firmly establish an economic alternative to capitalism, some people will always \"win\" and the range will always be predisposed to grow. But that's why socialism needs to be more than just a one-off revolution: ideally, it is a *constant* reset of the range of wealth.  Besides, the idea of scarcity and skills only functions properly in a fair marketplace, which isn't possible under late capitalism.

It might mean a more stressful job, but insofar that workload means the amount of hours worked, or the amount of tasks finished, it doesn't mean a higher workload but a different one.  \n\nMy point with socioeconomic capital is that the person hired to be a CEO is said to have certain skills because of the institutions that gatekeep the documentation of these skills (i.e. diplomas, etc).   So it's less a matter of individual skillfulness per say (not that that's irrelevant), but the amount of capital pumped into a person to transform them into what is societally recognized as \"qualified\" for a CEO position.  Part of my beef with this is, of course, that this limits high-pay positions to those who can afford to invest enough capital to be \"qualified\" for them.  Over time, as capital accumulates in families, this results in multi-generational socioeconomic stratification, allowing for certain groups of people to be \"qualified\" for jobs like CEOs and others not to be.  From my point of view, thus, it's hard to assert that CEOs get paid as much as they do because they're truly that skillful.  Rather, they get paid as much as they do because they're affluent, frankly.  \n\nValue to shareholders does NOT always mean value to workers.  Do all companies have the features you mentioned?  And how much does voice does a single laborer in a company's shareholding have in comparison to those who invest much larger sums simply to enrich themselves?  Besides, when the primary motive of a company is to provide profit to shareholders, it reduces the company's laborers to mere capital themselves.  \n\nI guess it seems rather inhuman to me to allow the affluent (shareholders) to influence what happens to the product created by workers, simply because shareholders decided to invest in a company for their own profit.  On the one side, you have the workers' livelihood, but on the other you only have an already affluent shareholder who wants to expand their affluence further.  Since workers don't have the option to opt out of selling their labor on the market, and thus can't escape being subject to the whims of capital, it seems that the least which can be done is to allow workers full control over how that capital is allocated within an entity.  \n\nWithout a method for workers to control their own pay/the value of products they've created, capital will continue to accumulate until the social instability caused by this gap threatens the rule of law that protects the capital in the first place.  As Marx said, \"the last capitalist we hang shall be the one who sold us the rope\".  Of course, I don't advocate killing capitalists, but the underlying point of this quote still holds.  Without a way to stop this process of accumulation, eventually the drive for ever-greater profit will defeat itself by making the very conditions allowing it to exist unstable.  \n\nThis may be nit-picky, but it's probs more accurate to call yourself a supporter OF capitalism, rather than a capitalist.

Or is the work simply of a different nature?  For example: is the organizational effort expended by the owner of a factory actually greater than the effort expended by the engineers designing products?  Or the floor workers who work long hours under more physically demanding conditions?  Executives often gain their positions because they are possessors of an immense amount of sociocultural capital (i.e. university, networking, etc), which is nothing more than economic capital in a converted form.  So essentially, their qualification is that they either own a lot of capital or have had a lot of capital invested in them over the years.  \n\nCEOs do wield immense organizational power, true, but does that necessarily imply they are the only ones capable of doing so?

When I say \"independent verification\", what I mean is through the scientific method.  That is to say the observation of a phenomenon which, in a controlled setting (i.e. where potentially interfering variables are controlled for), can beyond the shadow of a doubt be attributed to a causal relationship with its proposed catalyst.  Furthermore, this process must be *reproduceable* and show the same result.  The reproduceable of a phenomenon is key, as it allows for different parties to *independently* examine a topic and *verify* each others' conclusion, as well as to confirm the cause-and-effect relationship.  \n\nThis does *not* apply to the material taught in a Christian education model because 1) often the questions cannot be observed in a controlled setting, which precludes the confirmation of a cause-and-effect relationship  2) the results (i.e. faith) are not something that can be duplicated.\n\nThis *does* apply to the material taught in a secular education model because 1) the questions asked are generally within a scenario that controls for variables, which allows for a definite cause-and-effect relationship to be established  2) the result of these questions are something that can be duplicated.  \n\nTo think of it more simply, can you do a 10th-grade lab experiment on God's existence?  No, because the parameters set for \"independent verification\" cannot be met.  You can't control the variables, and you certainly can't reliably reproduce anything.  How about a lab experiment on the necessity of oxygen for combustion?  This meets the parameters for independent verification because it is, materially, easy to reproduce under controlled conditions.  \n\n\n> Well then, this is where the problem of that rhetoric crosses with anything you'd find in human history...\n\n\nThe problem with relying on written accounts is 1) authorship (which is incredibly difficult to confirm)  and  2) reliability.  With most historical sources where authorship and reliability are not entirely clear, language like \"probably\" or \"it is generally agreed\" is commonly used.  This means that the conclusions are open for discussion, if new sources are introduced.  However, with many Christians' interpretation of the Gospel, there is no room for \"probably\" or \"it is most likely\".  Just because the Gospels were supposedly written by eyewitnesses doesn't mean that 1) it actually was authored by eyewitnesses  2)  that these eyewitnesses are reliable, if indeed it was written by eyewitnesses at all.  Furthermore, there isn't even the vestige of there being eyewitnesses for large parts of the Old Testament.  Who supposedly witnessed the Earth being created, or Adam and Eve in the Garden?  The only remaining recourse is divine revelation (to Moses, who if I'm not incorrect is traditionally supposed to be the one who wrote the Torah).  But divine revelation, as a technique, is *not* regarded as reliable evidence in historical accounts as a whole.  \n\nFor the reasons listed above, the Gospel is not possible to verify without a shadow of a doubt, just like many other historical events can't be 100% verified.  That, of course, does not mean it is pure fiction any more than another historical event.  But (many) Christians insist on the infallibility of the Bible, which is not an argument extended to other historical accounts.  Were Christians open to the potential that parts of the historical record in the Bible perhaps weren't precisely the way they believed them to be, or even straight-up untrue, then you could apply the eyewitness/historical argument.  \n\nThe bottom line is: while secular education is responsive and willing to shift its conclusions based on evidence, Christianity is unable to shift its conclusions because they aren't evidence-based.  Not that they need to be, of course, because faith isn't a matter of *proof*, but it isn't correct to say Christian truths are equivalent to scientific ones.  They are inherently non-scientific, and shouldn't try to be supported in a scientific manner (because they can't be).

While it did do away with a refreshing amount of the corruption building during the Hu Jintao era, it also targeted Xi's MANY enemies within the party, at first those who were in the Bo Xilai camp but then extending quite a ways further.  The bigger problem with this purge is that it has knocked the legs out from under China's previous model of collective governance, putting more and more power in Xi and Xi alone's hands.  Not even the Standing Committee has much power to disagree with him, which is super dangerous because it opens up the potential for grievous mistakes.  \n\n-I'm not sure what you mean about being steadily done away with: there was actually just a sanitation workers' strike in Shanghai's Changning District, about two kilometers from where I live, and yea the government took capital's side hard on that one, coming down hard on all who participated.  Quite a few are in jail now. Another strike recently happened in Shenzhen, same story.

It's been well established by a number of Marxist and non-Marxist academics that Socialism with Chinese Characteristics is nothing more than the transitional screen used by Deng Xiaoping's camp to turn a Maoist party into a nationalist one.  Just look at how the Chinese education system changed in the 80s and 90s, doing away with Maoist thought and replacing it with chest-thumping slogans like \u52ff\u5fd8\u56fd\u803b (never forget national humiliation) and today's Patriotic Education program.

Add in the way that labor is routinely suppressed in favor of capital under the name of \"stability maintenance\" and the growing concentration camps in places like Tibet and Xinjiang (based off of XJP's trademark \"predictive policing\"), and it becomes clear that old Emperor Xi is about as Marxist as he is able to take criticism -- ergo, not at all.  I agree that it is important to take all criticisms of China by the West with a hefty grain of salt, but the scythe sweeps both ways -- you really have to not take a lot of SWCC's platitudes at face value, because a lot of it is just that.

As for illegal immigration: so you're fine with tearing families apart and deporting children who grew up in the US and haven't ever even BEEN to the country they're being sent back to?  \n\n\"barred from various things\"\n\nI can name 1) barring Muslims from entering the US  2) barring/attempting to bar people from \"shithole countries\" from entering the US  3) barring transgender troops from serving  4)  barring protestors from entering his rallies and encouraging violence against them  5)  attempting to silence the ongoing FBI investigation on Russian interference  6) attempting to silence the numerous people he's sexually assaulted (19+) (there's an entire wikipedia page about it actually).
