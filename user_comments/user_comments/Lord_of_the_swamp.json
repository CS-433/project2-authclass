Je krijgt veel uitleg en handige grammatica oefeningen plus luisteroefeningen, hoewel die soms niet helemaal goed opgenomen zijn. Maar zeker een goede app om te starten.\n\nSuperChinese is ook wel een goeie maar ik heb de betaalde versie niet getest dus kan er niet zo veel over zeggen voor de rest.\n\nPleco is een app die eigenlijk onmisbaar is want het is een geweldig woordenboek waar je ook onbekende karakters kan tekenen om ze op te zoeken. Die moet je echt hebben.\n\nDuolingo is ok, maar ik vond het als beginner veel te onduidelijk dus die zou ik bewaren voor als je al vrij ver bent puur voor herhaling.\n\nInFlow Chinese is een hele goede flashcard app waar je honderden woorden kan oefenen, heel goed om je geheugen op peil te houden maar je leert natuurlijk geen schrijven of zinsopbouw.\n\nDuChinese is een app voor het lezen van teksten die ook zeker aan te raden is, maar ook hier heb ik niet de betaalde versie geprobeerd. \n\nClozemaster is ook wel goed voor allerlei talen maar beter geschikt voor een iets hoger niveau.\n\nWat denk ik het belangrijkste is is dat je veel blijft lezen, hiervoor is ook een geweldige browser extention die ik altijd aan heb staan: zhongwen chinese popup dictionary. Hiermee kan je de pinyin en betekenis van chinese woorden zien als je je muis er over houdt wat enorm helpt met leesoefeningen. Ik gebruik dit echt elke dag. Installeer ook meteen het chinese toetsenbord van windows en leef je uit op bijv. duolingo wanneer je er aan toe bent.\n\nNog een paar handige links naar kanalen en websites die mij heel erg helpen:\n\n[https://hskreading.com/beginner/](https://hskreading.com/beginner/)\n\n[http://chinesereadingpractice.com/](http://chinesereadingpractice.com/)\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcvTOgUiplI80SPR73ogCEQ](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcvTOgUiplI80SPR73ogCEQ)\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/c/ShuoshuoChinese%E8%AF%B4%E8%AF%B4%E4%B8%AD%E6%96%87](https://www.youtube.com/c/ShuoshuoChinese%E8%AF%B4%E8%AF%B4%E4%B8%AD%E6%96%87)\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/c/GraceMandarinChinese](https://www.youtube.com/c/GraceMandarinChinese)\n\nHet is een hele lap tekst geworden maar hopelijk kan je er wat mee. Wat scholen betreft heb ik echt geen idee hoe goed dat werkt. Ik denk dat je met thuisstudie makkelijk HSK4 kan bereiken en als je HSK5 bereikt is het ook de moeite waard om een examen te doen als je daar behoefte aan hebt, maar wat ik het meeste kan aanraden is gewoon heel veel blijven lezen, elke dag, en dingen zoeken die je leuk lijken. Chinees kan vreselijk frustrerend zijn omdat zoveel woorden hetzelfde klinken en alles compleet anders is dan wat je gewend bent van Europese talen, maar als je het leuk gaat vinden gaat er een hele wereld voor je open.", "created_utc": "1640296481.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hpqf8e7", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_rmq18g", "parent_id": "t1_hppi5dh", "score": "3", "subreddit": "tokkiefeesboek", "subreddit_id": "t5_3czn3"}, {"author": "Lord_of_the_swamp", "body": "Ik ben nu ongeveer anderhalf jaar bezig met Mandarijn en het is best te doen. In het begin lijkt het een onmogelijke chaos en is het irritant dat je werkelijk niks kan lezen maar zodra je een basis legt en de meest veelvoorkomende woorden en regels een beetje kent is het niet meer zo erg. Het grootste voordeel vergeleken met talen als Duits is dat je woorden niet hoeft te vervoegen (waar ik altijd helemaal gek van wordt met alle uitzonderingen etc).Als je serieus wilt beginnen met Mandarijn moet je er wel echt elke dag tijd in steken en heel veel herhalen, anders vergeet je het heel snel. Het beste begin je met pinyin en leesvaardigheid. Ik zou geen tijd in handmatig karakters leren schrijven investeren want dat zal je vrijwel nooit nodig hebben en veel Chinezen kunnen dat zelf niet eens meer goed.
