one sister off, beat the boss, finish the game on normal, don't bother grinding, play on easy, whatever. reload, keep all the sisters alive and beat the boss, go into the last chapter and actually do all your collecting and grinding and all that happy stuff and get the true ending and all character endings. when you're totally done getting all other trophies, make a clear save and do a hard-mode

they'll eventually become clearer over time, but for most, just shoving kunyomi and onyomi down your brain hole will be a leaky and unrewarding waste of time.\n\nnow, if properly distinguishing and recognizing kanji from each other is the issue, then there are ways to help with that. the most important is probably to learn the kanji radicals and parts. one *cannot* skip memorizing by learning the pieces, but you can learn to turn each kanji into a narrative.\n\nfor an example. \u4eba means man. but the \u30a4 piece you see on the left of a bunch of kanji is actually a squished \u4eba symbol, i.e. \u4ed8\u3000\u4ed5\u3000\u4f1d\u3000\u4f53. take the last one for example, \u4f53 is composed of person \u4eba and book/source/basis \u672c. the character \u4f53 is \u304b\u3089\u3060, or \"body\". you can imagine how you could come up with a narrative in your head like \"the source of a person is their body\".\n\nor that the \u624con the left is a modified \u624b\uff1d\u3066\uff1dhand character and thus \u4f8d \u6301 \u5f85 are different characters. they all have \u5bfa\uff1d\u3058\uff1dtemple in them, but the part on the left differs. many many kanji are going to look similar but

pronunciation of a character every time you run into a new character, then find real words for each pronunciation and memorize those. like

Pick something around your level, read it (or a bite size piece of it like a page or a chapter), pick it apart for grammar and words you need to learn, study them a bit, maybe even read the same thing in english just to check your comprehension, then REread the native material to use what you studied. Consider iterating a few times on the same material but also don't overdo it to try to be perfect.
