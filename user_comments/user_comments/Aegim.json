Loving my 11\" but somtimes I wish I had gotten the 12.9\". It's perfect for what I bought it for but once I had it in my hands, my mind went wild and the possibilities expanded and now I wish I had a bigger screen, but at the same time, I don't. I can still do all those things and 11\" are enough. I mostly hold my 11\" two handed, but I do occasionally balance it on my fingers. I think the general consensus is that the 12.9\" gets you tired quite fast\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2. I love the pencil, it's so good, but if you're not drawing you can probably go cheaper. Same for the keyboard. The logitech combo touch seems particularly fitting BUT do wait a bit and see if you'd rather have a keyboard that's not always attached to the iPad. And you might not even want a trackpad\n\n3) For mostly splitscreen go 12.9 imo. But if you're okay with the small rectangle the 11\" is still quite good\n\nI got the 11\" with the intention of keeping my laptop and using it to take notes, I've tried splitscreen video watching and note taking in splitview in 50/50 and it's not the best, doable but not great. That's because what happens is that it keeps the fullscreen video in one half of the screen to get a slightly bigger rectangle, but you can't \"fullscreen\" the whole half, it opens in a small rectangle with a LOT of black space around it, so maybe the XDR thing will actually help with that\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou can \"fullscreen\" so it only shows a small square, I think you can click on it and open it up to take better quality screenshots, if you tap twice on it this rectangle becomes bigger, I'd suggest this, and using Youtube in a browser, selecting the square option and then opening your app gives you a small rectangle in the corners which you can make bigger, and you get to use your notetaking app as full screen. And that is very usable, but if you need to read small letters in the video or something like that, the 12.9\" might be a little bit easier\n\n&#x200B;\n\nmaybe I'm doing something wrong idk, but since it won't let me open a video in one half of the screen I'd say go bigger lol, like on my 11\" I can definitely take notes and watch the video in 50/50 but it's not as good, but if you make it 3/4 (with the majority of the screen going to the notetakaing app) notetaking is better but the video is very small, so I think getting the small corner rectangle is better\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt's not that it's not doable since you can still zoom in and out, etc it's just not the best.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAll that said, if the video has no written text you must follow, you can go 3/4 and it's pretty nice, and 50/50 is doable too.\n\nThat said idk if it's that much better in the 12.9 as I don't own it but it has to be better\n\nI wish in an update they'll allow me to place the video on the top, instead of on the left", "created_utc": "1633590084.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hfpanng", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_q2zl0n", "parent_id": "t3_q2zl0n", "score": "4", "subreddit": "iPadPro", "subreddit_id": "t5_316hw"}, {"author": "Aegim", "body": "I never said they were mutually exclusive, in fact, it was implied twice in my comment\n\nFor the blaming themselves part, I think most victims of abuse blame themselves no matter what, and then if the person is mentally ill they excuse them because since they're not they feel it's their job to manage the other person's mental illness tbh.

I think the issue is trouble regulating my emotions, so it was easier not to have them, cause when I was even younger when I'd cry I couldn't stop and I loathed that, but since I stopped having to deal with that I never learnt how to self-regulate in a way that didn't make me switch them off, so nowadays I'm trying to do that (?) but I don't know exactly how, it's kinda hard to put yourself in super shitty situations just for practice...

It's also well structured and you don't have to think about what to do next too much (only whether or not you wanna repeat a lesson). It's also supposed to be used on the daily and on days I can't do much studying it's one of the few things I get done. It also has some gamification geared towards their particular lesson, mix and match and flashcards mostly. You're not taught how to write the characters but you can see them and hear them at the same time. They use all the alphabets, and then have romaji so you can read them (I wish they gave the option to tweak this like other apps do)\n\nLingoDeer is also structured and you don't have to think much of you follow their lesson plan, they also incentivize you to use it everyday, lessons give you hints, it's like a better duolingo, and you can use it while you're waiting around (instead of losing your time on social media when there's nothing new). It teaches you to write the characters which is great (this part is free and there are several other apps just for this purpose)\n\nLingoDeer Plus has the same games Pimsleur has and a lot of new ones, the setback being that the vocab seems random at times and they just throw a lot of new words at you and then you get going without learning them slowly first.

The courses rarely open and it was getting mixed with my French, so I dropped it, did French for like 4 years or so once a week, with breaks in between.  I also did try watch  media with subtitles in both languages all those years ago, then I only attempted  it in French sometimes and I struggled with every other word. I'd like to think it ended up paying off, I think I mostly did it at the start of my break from it, and picked Duolingo  back up like a week before getting back to some classes\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTook a  1 year long break from French (probably like  a year and two  months), then came back to it this June, they told me I showed signs of B2, it was much better than I was specting tbh, reacquired it really easily, right now I'm taking intensive courses every weekday and decided to actually read comics, and listen to podcasts and fium! I can understand most of it, I still have issues with accurate production though, but now I can say I speak French, before I would only say I was taking French classes. Before  that 1 year break  I actually studied  grammar before every exam and still felt like I was struggling, now I no longer study for any exams, or anything really, just what we do in class.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSoon after taking those intensive French courses I got back into studying Italian, which I hadn't used for 5 years or more. The teacher liked me and thought I was smart because all those years ago I got a 98 on the intro course. I decided to reread the book we had used (got halfway through and it was the same book this time around for A2), so I got into the A2 level without making and exam, everything felt familiar and all of that, but I had only reread like 40 pages from that book once, I was seriously thinking about  dropping it for like 3 months, but just before the first  exam I had regained most of my ability. Passed the course with a 92. I no longer reread the book for Italian as a way of studying (the new material), I just wing it when the time comes around  and hope we did  enough drilling  during  classes, which differs from what I did for my first French courses... I'm gonna keep doing this because it's not a priority language for me, but hey, It's better to learn something than not to, hopefully when I can start understanding most things like I do in French I'll start putting more effort into it, and if I abandon it again I now know it's easy to regain my Italian ability. I find that I keep forgetting vocabulary, so I picked up Drops to  drill it a bit\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMaybe it's good to take breaks and then regain each language?
