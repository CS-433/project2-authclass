He said that a good measure of \"fluency\" is if you can carry a conversation in a pub. He didn't qualify the statement about what that conversation could or should be about, he just said a conversation. Any *serious* polyglot or even \"polyglot\" should bristle at the idea just a conversation can even be equated to \"fluent\". \n\nYes, \"fluent\" is a vague idea, but the whole point here is that Richards was setting the bar exceedingly low in order to give himself a pass for having low language skills yet being able to claim \"fluency\". That is the issue. \"Fluency\", in my opinion, should be a fairly lofty goal, why should he be allowed to revise the meaning of that, and thus the achievements of those of us who consider C1 and above to be the benchmarks of \"fluency\", down that low? For a person who presents himself as an authority on language learning methods and advice, he is simply looking for loopholes to cheat the very thing that defines his public persona. \n\nFor a serious language student, the \"pub test\" should be the minimum, not the sign post that \"you have made it!\" Sure, for some that's the goal, but for someone who has put in a decade plus of serious effort to get to where I am in my Russian journey, I find offensive that he can just be allowed to denigrate my achievements to a wider audience and make whatever minimal of the \"pub test\" to be some sort of standard bar.\n\nEdit: I've sat around many tables and debated plenty of philosophy, high politics, and other complicated topics in Russian many times with many people. I've experienced the gamut of your comment. And even when I was doing that on a semi-regular basis, I didn't even consider myself fluent. I considered myself to be \"just pretty good\".

If you want to learn words, don't worry about your reading speed - focus on learning the words first, and the speed will come later as you know more and more words. If your goal is speed and finishing the book, you won't learn that many words.\n\nAlso, what do you mean by advanced vocabulary? I find it helpful to seek out certain types of things I want to learn - time expressions, conjunctions, abstract nouns, interesting/specific verbs - and focus my efforts there. I don't need all kinds of adjectives, since ultra descriptive adjectives generally aren't that important in spoken language and only really appear in book contexts. If that's your thing, by all means, go for it. Otherwise, knowing what to skip is just as important as knowing what to include.\n\nAlso, \"advanced vocabulary\" does mean necessarily means \"words\", it also means expressions (groups of words that may or may not translate literally) and collocations. Putting work into understanding these as you consume media will help immensely.\n\nThe way I go about it is to just read. If I come across a word that either A) I believe is crucial to the meaning of the text and I cannot guess the context or B) I think would be super interesting to know, I'll stop and look it up. If I read a selection (sentence, paragraph, page) and just don't understand it, I'll go back and look as much as necessary to fully comprehend, and then add what I feel are the most important words to my flashcards.\n\nHow much media do you consume outside of reading? If you watch a variety of tv show genres, you'll start picking up different types of vocabulary since you'll understand all the words around the unknown words. This is where reading and listening really start to benefit and mutually support each other.

General improvement? Better vocabulary? Improvement in a particular area (listening/writing/speaking)? My understanding from your post is that you're looking for \"general improvement\", so I'm going comment on that.\n\n> 30 min / day reading novels or articles\n\nStart with this, but do not feel bound to stop at the 30 minute mark. Instead, enjoy yourself and have fun.\n\nYou say you're B1, so let's start there - you need vocabulary. While reading, prioritize what's important to both you *AND* your goals. My suggestion is to focus first on verbs, common things, time, conjunctions, and adverbs of degree. Those categories will take you the furthest in the shortest amount of time. Comic books are solid, if you can find them, and novels are amazing, but try to stick with relatively recent works(~40 years) in order to maximize the vocabulary and grammar you pull from it.\n\nWhat about TV shows or movies? That type of media is the most accurate in terms of how normal people speak. Prioritize the phrases and constructions you hear in the shows in order to maximize the value of the words when it comes time to speak. Find any sort of downtime during the day and just pop in some headphones to stream your favorite tv content. Pay attention when you can, let it play in the background when you need to. The constant exposure will start to pay off pretty quick.\n\n> 5 - 10 min / day searching for new tools and evaluating my progress\n\nWhy? I would say that this is superfluous and the time would be better spent just reading or watching tv.\n\n> 1-2 h / week learning from a textbook (grammar,...)\n\nIf you already have a solid grasp of grammar, use this as a reference, not an active tool. You'll get the exposure you need in context while reading. When you find something you don't know, look it up and *then* practice it. Native context is always the better route. If your grammar is not all that solid, by all means, use the books *alongside the other practice* to build up your skills.\n\n> 15 min / day using an app (like tv5 monde)\n\nDoes this provide a benefit that reading and other forms of input and practice don't? IMO, once you get past the beginning stages, apps really aren't necessary, so unless you really like it and find solid benefit in it, seriously consider what value it brings to your studies and adjust accordingly.\n\nYou say you want to devote a fair amount of time to writing - that's awesome, absolutely do that. \n\nMost of all\n\n* Don't feel the need to stay boxed into these strict time boxes\n* If something works for you, do it until it stops working\n* If something isn't working for you, do what you can to understand why.

First, with reference to my teacher's advice, he meant that you should learn as many verbs as you can - if you come across a text with a lot of unknown words, start by looking up the verbs first and then work your way through other parts of speech. \n\nTo your second question, there's a reason why verbs are often the most difficult part of a language. Most languages in the world pack so much meaning into their verbs that it is virtually impossible to communicate with them if you don't have a solid grasp on those concepts. Therefore, in my opinion, yes, you should master all tenses - that's low hanging fruit that significantly increases your ability to express yourself across a massive range of situations. Conjugation drills are fine in the beginning, but just reading a lot and paying proper attention to usage throughout the readings is more important overall since it's that exposure that really teaches you how the verbs function both overall and in very specific circumstances.\n\nWith YouTube, I'm specifically referring to TV shows and even movies. I should have clarified that it's not easy to find good TV shows for all languages, and, depending on the language (looking at you German...), you still probably need a VPN. But like Russian and Greek, there is precious little content on Netflix, but entire troves of it on YouTube - if I watched Russian tv shows for 8 hours per day, it would take at least a year to get through all of it, and probably a lot more than that.

Learning how people speak in conversation teaches you the language's natural rhythms and inconsistencies - once you can pick up and understand those, your listening comprehension will skyrocket and other forms of spoken content will become much easier.\n\nReading and listening reinforce each other. The trick is to find the correct type of content for both so that they are complimentary. In my experience, a novel (yes, it's hard, especially in the beginning) + either cop drama or other type of drama are best, because sitcoms and comedies often has a lot of subtleties that are difficult even for learners at a more advanced stage.", "created_utc": "1643638588.0", "edited": "False", "id": "huzu431", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_sgjfhb", "parent_id": "t3_sgjfhb", "score": "1", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "Creative_Shallot_860", "body": "This looks great, but do you have any example sentences with IPA/gloss/etc besides the basic word order examples?

If you do use SRS, this question won't apply to you, but I'm still curious to hear from people who don't use SRS systems.\n\nHow do you handle less common words or non-transparent/infrequent grammatical constructions? Books, especially novels, contains a lot of words that are really good to know, but they don't really come up that often, e.g. enthusiasm, honesty, \"charming frankness\" (that came from a passage I read today), to get around to (do), to pale in comparison (with), to find time to (do), to open up to (someone), to prop oneself up by one's elbows, to stick one's nose into/butt in, bit by bit, various bookish synonyms for degree, etc. This may seem like a random list but they are all found in the current and most previous novels I've read. Also, these words/expressions may or not be transparent in your TL, but most of them can be expressed using a single words in mine.\n\nThese types of words *can* be clear from context, but \"charming frankness\", at least in my book, was a stand alone quote that was used somewhat sarcastically, so it wasn't super obvious. Another example, in my TL, \"enthusiasm\" is generally conveyed in standard speech as \"with pleasure\" or ~\"with gusto\"(kinda), and so I don't think I've ever actually learned the word/root for enthusiasm or enthusiastic.\n\nI'm curious how you learn those words. Maybe you don't, and that doesn't bother you, which is perfectly fine if it fits your goals.

Both use aspectual pairs. Most of the time, in both languages, the pairs are transparent, but for many common verbs they are not.\n\n2. Both rely heavily on word stress. However, Greek is nice and tells you where the stress falls, Russian does not. \n\n3. Both languages use a somewhat similar prefix-root-suffix system for more-or-less transparent word formation. However, Greek is much older and semantic shift has had more time to mess with the meanings of words.\n\n4. Both languages can have fairly long words. Both have cases - in my opinion, Greek cases are more difficult since there are fewer. Learning them is easier, but practical usage is harder since their uses are not necessarily as clear as in Russian, since each case has so many more situations in which they apply.\n\n5. Both languages make extensive use of participles. There is overlap in their usage, but each has its own idiosyncratic ways of using those participles.\n\nGreek\n\n1. The Greek TAM system is more complicated than Russian, but with a Romance background, it's not that bad. That said, I came into Greek having studied Russian for a long, long time, so the overlap meant that I didn't have to learn the Greek TAM system from scratch, I already had strong mental understanding of aspect and its uses, although aspectual usage does differ between the languages.\n\n2. Greek has a much smaller phonetic inventory than Russian, so it has to make do with fewer sounds and relies more on how to combine those sounds, making listening comprehension and vocabulary retention a little more difficult. This inventory is also softer, which can play tricks on the ear sometimes.\n\n3. For English speakers, Greek vocab is not that bad, since large swaths of English (and Romance) words originally came from Greek.\n\nRussian\n\n1. Few people talk about Russian stress, but most learners don't learn it properly after they graduate from coursebooks and graded readers.\n\n2. Verbs of motion are hard, but once you see them used in the wild enough they really aren't that bad. Metaphorical extension of those verbs of motion can be fairly complicated and not transparent at all.\n\n3. Russian tv production is sleeker than Greek to production, but that doesn't necessarily make the quality or enjoyability any better.\n\n4. People always talk about reading the great Russian authors. Yeah, maybe one day, but it's going to be a long while. That's like someone learning English to read Dickens and Bront\u00eb - sure, maybe they can, but it's highly specialized and completely unnecessary for everyday communication.\n\n5. Colloquial speech is actually rather simple. The Russians know they have a complicated language, and they keep everyday speech rather simple to accommodate for it. I haven't been studying Greek long enough to have observed anything to this end (although ALL languages simplify spoken language to at least some degree).\n\nAll in all, I'm still a beginner in Greek, whereas I'm a C1 in Russian and I use Russian all the time. I've had more fun learning Greek, but that's because I perceive it as being much easier than Russian, mainly due to all of the concepts I learned while studying Russian. You'll probably progress faster in the beginning stages with Greek, but once you start getting into abstract nouns based on verbs, Russian can be much more transparent, but that's just my experience.\n\nEdit: A couple of spelling and word touchups.", "created_utc": "1634992344.0", "edited": "1634997489.0", "id": "hhqi83j", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_qdmpwc", "parent_id": "t3_qdmpwc", "score": "7", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "Creative_Shallot_860", "body": "I think you've missed the above poster's point. Trying to learn two languages from the very beginning at the same time is always discouraged.

In addition, Russian stress is phonemic, and is not written, so you have to devote a portion of your attention and effort into learning how stress works in Russian words.\n\nWhat's your native language? Unless it's Ukrainian/Belorussian or whatever Japanese's closest relative is, Russian and Japanese have extremely steep learning curves, especially in the beginning.

One of these is good for a beginner, the other is complete trash.\n\nI like the dialogues, they are short, to the point, and, for a beginner, act as a means of comprehensible input with a transcript, which is actually rather hard to find for Greek - you generally have to pay a Patreon fee to get access to the transcripts. The audio has background noise too, which is nice for mimicking real listening situations. The associated lessons are generally trash, but as pure listening exercises, I won't complain. As an absolute beginner, you can get these dialogues for free. I'm not sure how many are free after the absolute beginner level though.\n\nThe extensive readings, on the other hand, are anything but.

I don't have a problem with Kreshen *per se*, I have a problem with the way that people have cherry picked his arguments and contorted those arguments into this strict, input-only bastard that serves no purpose other than justifying their own laziness. To me, strict input-only adherents are more interested in the social status of their \"race\" to log the most hours watching NL anime than they are in learning a language. But you're right, it's that cherry picking which has removed the \"continuum\" from the online language learning community and now all learning must be either \"traditional\" or \"input only\", apparently.\n\nHowever, my issue with Krashen stems from an anecdote he told in his interview with MvJ: he told a story about how his Spanish study (now) consists primarily of reading sci-fi novels and having a weekly conversation with a cashier at the grocery store. Despite not putting in any active study work (at least at the present time, I don't remember what previous work he had put in), he says that his speech improved with each weekly conversation. I simply fail to see how he is able to truly acquire the necessary vocabulary and store it properly by exclusively committing to extensive reading.\n\nNow, I don't necessarily disagree with that experience - I've had a similar experience with Russian. The difference is that I've been studying Russian for ~16 years, I've lived there, and I already consider myself to be a fluent speaker across a fair range of topics. My understanding of Krashen's anecdote is not that he was a beginner with Spanish, but I didn't see much evidence that he had really done that kind of work with Spanish outside of some basic studies. (I may be misremembering/misinterpreting some of that conversation, apologies if so, I don't mean to). And yes, it *is* Spanish, so I do give him a little bit more leeway due to how close Spanish can be to English. \n\nThe issue is that, in my opinion, this sets unrealistic expectations for beginners (and maybe even intermediates) who think that simple reading is going to make them fluent almost overnight. It's that unrealistic expectation mixed with the idea that you only need to listen A LOT, and that's all you need to learn a foreign language, even one as notoriously difficult as Japanese (at least for English/IE speakers).", "created_utc": "1627215144.0", "edited": "False", "id": "h6gt6yq", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_oqstn7", "parent_id": "t1_h6glhl5", "score": "7", "subreddit": "languagelearningjerk", "subreddit_id": "t5_37rt5"}, {"author": "Creative_Shallot_860", "body": "Oh, absolutely.

The comments don't have to be long, just say what you can.\n\n* Try Robin McPherson's Journaly app. I haven't used it myself, but I've heard some good reviews and people do seem to generally want to help.\n\nHave you done any shadowing? Don't pull content directly from native media, but use content from JapanesePod101's listening comprehension series on YouTube. Find an appropriate level, and shadow through the dialogues line by line. Is it perfect? No. Does it train you mouth muscles and rhythmic flow? Yes. \n\nTalk to yourself.

Each verb stem has three tense forms, resulting in a total of twelve stems for most verbs, although the realis future is slowly being replaced by the irrealis future, and may eventually phase out entirely, leaving only ten stems.\n\nThe copula was not completely discarded though.

However, there are some caveats with that.\n\nThere are a couple of schools of thought regarding speaking (not necessarily shadowing) from the beginning. One says, absolutely, go for it. The other - Lamont from Days of French 'n' Swedish is of this school, I believe - says that speaking too early will interfere with accent development and therefore should be avoided. I understand where that school is coming from, but I disagree on how much it will affect someone's accent. That said, my mouth is really good with accents, so I might be an exception to the general rule.\n\nOn shadowing, it's all about the source material. For an absolute beginner, the material needs to be a recording of a real person, but only using simplified language, with accompanying text, and with the ability to control the playback speed. For example, LanguagePod101 Absolute Beginner lessons, Teach Yourself lessons, and Glossika are all good resources since they use an appropriate level of language, contain the text that you can read, and you can control the playback speed and slow it down in order to practice the mechanics before speeding up to natural speed. Then, once learned, you can use the audio at natural speed as early listening exercises until you're comfortable with the mechanics, rhythm, and sticking points, such as where minor syllables are reduced.\n\nThere's also the added benefit of greater retention and recall due to being able to pronounce the word correctly, both within and outside of context. In addition, it's also a good method of sentence mining for beginners, since, at this point, if the language level is appropriate, EVERYTHING will be something you need to know, with no uncommon or super difficult words. \n\nLet me give a practical example. I'm learning Greek, which has a really simple and limited phonology, but a lot of vowel-on-vowel sequences, which get pushed together in normal speech. Shadowing at the absolute beginner level - using GreekPod101 lessons and, recently, Glossika - has helped me to learn the mechanics of the language's rhythm and pronunciation as well as to hear those vowel chains and reductions when I immerse.\n\nOn the opposite end of the spectrum, I was flirting with Georgian last summer. Georgian is notorious for ridiculous consonant clusters and series of very similar sounding consonants (I live -> /vts'xovrob/). Without shadowing the texts in my textbooks, my ear would have never learned to hear some of those clusters. Don't get me wrong, I never immersed enough to truly learn to hear it all, but shadowing certainly helped with learning a language that different from English. Since Georgian is my real TL goal, now that I know they have it on Glossika, I may give it another go once I feel comfortable with Greek (which I'm frankly using as something of a proof-of-concept for my own adaptation of Refold).\n\nEdit: Spelling", "created_utc": "1619606920.0", "edited": "1619607511.0", "id": "gw5ox4e", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_n09cxk", "parent_id": "t3_n09cxk", "score": "5", "subreddit": "Refold", "subreddit_id": "t5_3azein"}, {"author": "Creative_Shallot_860", "body": "I've thought about this some.

What about verb aspect pairs and verb/preposition pairs? Verbs of motion? I know and understand that reading is what is going to help you learn those kinds of things, but having read Harry Potter (and some other books) in Russian myself, I can tell you that it's going to be a nasty slog to get through.\n\nPerhaps more importantly, how familiar are you with verbal adjectives and verbal adverbs (\u0432\u0438\u0434\u043e\u0432\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0447\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0438\u044f / \u0434\u0435\u0435\u043f\u0440\u0438\u0447\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0438\u044f)?

You may not be interested in them, but they are exceedingly useful and will help solidify grammar fundamentals unlike any other resource.\n\nRussian teachers LOVE to say, \"In most languages, words and grammar are connected but separate. In Russian, words and grammar are the same thing.\" I don't know how long you've been studying, how many words you know or how well you know your grammar, so you can tackle Harry Potter if that's what you want to do, but as someone with firsthand experience in every point I've mentioned here, my suggestion is to take it slow and make sure you understand the manner in which words can function, especially in a formal written context, so that you don't have to learn every single thing all at once, but can focus on what matters most in any given sentence.", "created_utc": "1616598548.0", "edited": "False", "id": "gs214hc", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_mbpiad", "parent_id": "t3_mbpiad", "score": "4", "subreddit": "Refold", "subreddit_id": "t5_3azein"}, {"author": "Creative_Shallot_860", "body": "It creates two cards - the first is a regular card, and then the next day it shows a flipped version.", "created_utc": "1613784687.0", "edited": "False", "id": "go2mg0y", "is_submitter": "True", "link_id": "t3_lnghnf", "parent_id": "t1_go2jxoi", "score": "1", "subreddit": "Refold", "subreddit_id": "t5_3azein"}, {"author": "Creative_Shallot_860", "body": "I did 4 years of Russian in university classes and lived in Moscow for several years, where I watched A LOT of tv.
