And I agree with you. The sad shame is that 99% of the time someone wants to talk about men\u2019s rights, it\u2019s people like Andrew Tate (or whatever his name is, you know who I mean) that are trying to hijack these issues for their personal gain. Men, on average, don\u2019t seem to be as socially wired as women, so we struggle to put these movements together. Because of this, it tends to be niches that will come together and fight for these issues and these niches seem more likely to be right wing.\n\nI think part of the issue is the perception that speaking about men\u2019s rights makes you a misogynist. I consider myself a feminist, and have been speaking far longer about women\u2019s rights than men\u2019s. Why? Because I was embarrassed and worried that it would undermine women, who I perceived as having a more urgent need.

If it turns out to be misogynist, then then that\u2019s shitty and we can throw it out. But some earnest men speak out about these things and are shut down, even by other men.

Most incels are a product of not meeting the masculine values expected in an \u2018attractive male\u2019. They frequently harp on about this with self-deprecating comments about their appearance, their lack of money, and their lack of social skills and hygiene and whatever. I think many incels feel resentful because they perceive women as upholding the values you call \u201ctoxic masculinity\u201d by choosing those people are partners.\n\nIt\u2019s very hard for normal, functioning men to convince a mentally ill man to start functioning in society like everyone else. It also means nothing when we tell them the truth: that women vary and while some women might be attracted to traditional masculine traits, not all are. How are we men meant to tell them that? It\u2019s like men telling women to sort out all the crazy people in their sex/gender, it\u2019s just a stupid thing to say.\n\nIncels are a societal problem. It\u2019s bigger than gender/sex or any one group. Incels often hate men just as much as they hate women\u2014(\u201cwhy do you date assholes like him? He\u2019ll treat you like shit and beat you but I\u2019m a nice guy\u201d)\u2014and won\u2019t listen to the men they perceive as being \u201cassholes\u201d for functioning.\n\nI\u2019m not saying the onus is on women to reconcile with them\u2014frankly, I don\u2019t think that would work either. The issue seems to start in childhood and deepen from there. We need better education in schools about social issues for men, so that these people can understand issues early and get help. Something worth bearing in mind, is that most men struggling with the same problems don\u2019t become Incels, they isolate themselves and sometimes commit suicide. Men and women\u2019s issues are connected and intertwined in a very causative way. For example, toxic masculinity often leads to women being abused and belittled, but it often leads to the same thing for men as well. Men who do not match typical masculine ideals are often ostracised (by both men and women in many cases), considered to be \u2018weird\u2019, and abused\u2014often by their parents as well as other children. Often, as these people get older, they become some of the most passionate purveyors of toxic masculinity because they have been so strongly conditioned in it. As a man who was once a shy, nerdy child with crippling anxiety, who was scared of sports, scared of fighting and scared of other people, I can tell you first hand that I was bullied horrendously for this, by both men and women. Boys and girls would both call me \u2018gay\u2019, \u2018weird\u2019, \u2018fat\u2019 (even though I literally wasn\u2019t), \u2018smelly\u2019 (even though I literally wasn\u2019t), and all sorts of other more personalised insults. Luckily, I got into a specific sport, my confidence increased, and this bullying dialled down because I began to meet more of the \u201cmasculinity requirements\u201d that young boys need to meet in order to not be ostracised. In school, kids used to steal my clothes and give them to the girls, and the girls would hide them in the girls\u2019 changing room so I couldn\u2019t get them. Sometimes even teachers would laugh at this treatment.\n\nThe onus isn\u2019t on you to reconcile with these people. They\u2019re mentally ill, yes, but they\u2019re also assholes. But it\u2019s definitely worth taking an honest and nonjudgmental look at how they came to be, so that we can understand how to proceed and improve the lives of future men *and* women.

I sometimes think I\u2019ve made a brilliant move, but almost always disagree with chess.com\u2019s idea of what my \u201cbrilliant\u201d moves are. Sometimes I\u2019ll make a sacrifice, follow it up with a cool three move tactic, then, on one fairly innocuous move in the sequence, it suddenly calls it brilliant. Rarely was it brilliant. Usually it was a common sense continuation of the sequence I had started a few moves earlier.\n\nI agree that this position is clearly winning, but if OP thought they were just blundering a knight\u2014not noticing the potential Queen capture\u2014then it isn\u2019t a brilliant move, it\u2019s a blunder. If you don\u2019t have the right plan to capitalise on it then this move only throws away a piece and leaves you in an endgame which is still winning, just like it was before.\n\nI just think people need to learn to rely more on their own chess abilities and less on chess.com\u2019s tags. The actual engine can be very helpful to identify and understand mistakes (by playing through the lines yourself and studying them to figure out why the engine makes the recommendation it did), but these tags are almost entirely useless. It also sometimes labels \u201cblunder\u201d when you sacrifice the exchange in the completely won position (let\u2019s say two rooks vs Knight and pawns) even though every human knows that it might be suboptimum, but simplifies the game into an easily winning king and rook vs king endgame. Why is that? Because the engine could easily avoid a blunder in that position and mate with the two rooks. By sacrificing the exchange, you\u2019ve extended the game by 10 or so moves. The computer sees this as a blunder, but it\u2019s the difference between having the carefully check every move and being able to premove the victory.\n\nThe engine is great. Look out for things like the eval bar going from +3 to +1 in one go\u2014even if the chess.com coach feature doesn\u2019t tag that move as a \u201cmistake\u201d or \u201cblunder\u201d. You should try to understand salient changes in the eval bar\u2014and by that, I mean don\u2019t bother with big but irrelevant changes, like +600 to +200.

Niemann needs only prove that Magnus acted with reckless disregard for the truth, not that Carlsen made knowingly false statements.\n\nWhy are you doing this to yourself?\n\n>If you are a public figure\u2014politician, athlete, celebrity or the like\u2014it is very unlikely you would be able to win a defamation claim. A public figure needs to be able to prove that the defendant published false information either not knowing or not caring whether it was false. This can be done, but is not successful very often.\n\nFrom a law firm, information specific to Missouri. So what you're referring to when you say \"reckless disregard for the truth\", is the thing I just quoted. Hans would have to prove that Magnus expressed his *opinion* that he *may* have been cheating while \"not caring whether it was false\". First of all, this is by nature very, very hard to prove, and is almost nonviable on its own. You're the attorney, tell me how you're planning to prove that Magnus didn't care whether what he suspected was true or not? A big reason why this case is nonviable is that Hans *actually did cheat*. Magnus saying \"I don't trust people who have cheated in the past and don't want to play against them\" is not defamatory because Hans *actually has cheated in the past*. Even someone who supports Hans would struggle to argue that Magnus acted without caring whether Hans cheated or not, because by Hans's own confession, he did cheat. Besides that, you need to actually prove this, not just believe it yourself. You need to prove it to a group of laymen like myself. Sure, it's plausible, but very much not likely. You're also downplaying (or not knowing) the full difficulty of this.\n\n>The Missouri Supreme Court has equated recklessness with disregard of the truth with subjective awareness of probable falsity. There must be sufficient evidence to permit the conclusion that the defendant in fact entertained serious doubts as to the truth of his publication. Glover v. Herald Co. 549 S.W.2d 858, 862 (Mo. 1977) (en banc).\n\nSo, in Missouri, Hans needs to prove that Magnus suspected his opinion had *probable falsity*. That's impossible and entirely nonviable. Why? Because, at the time of the accusations, there wasn't \"probably falsity\". This sub has combed over it for a long time, and multiple experts have revealed statistical analyses to find out. Plenty of top chess professionals also suspected Hans. The suspicion of Hans cheating may have been false, but it's entirely reasonable and therefore not defamatory under law. Also, \"probable falsity\" is pretty close to making knowingly false comments. Magnus would have to have believed that his suspicions were *most likely false*. Your comment is just wrong and has no basis in the law.\n\nYou are misinterpreting the law, either on purpose or through incompetence, to make your point.\n\n>Wrong. U.S. law is that honestly held opinions offered in good faith can be actionable. (St. Amant v. Thompson, 390 U.S. 727 (1968).) Failure to duly investigate one's suspicions before making an accusation constitutes actual malice where a defendant does not really know whether their accusation is true or false. (Curtis Publishing Co. v. Butts, 388 U.S. 130 (1967).)\n\nNot wrong at all. The UK does have a defence for \"honestly held opinions\". And while Missouri might not explicitly have this, you need to prove \"malice\" and \"a subjective awareness of probable falsity\", meaning that the defamer has to suspect what they are saying is *probably false*. That seems to defend honestly held opinions also, considering that nobody suspects their honestly held opinions to be most likely false.\n\n>The issue is not whether Niemann has cheated online in the past. The issue is whether Carlsen had an objectively reasonable basis to accuse Niemann of cheating OTB.\n\nThis is a big mistake that the article makes as well, and it was what I was referring to a while ago--but you denied it. Hans's lawsuit likes to focus on the likelihood that he didn't cheat in their OTB game, but that's neither here nor there when you actually look at Magnus's statements.\n\n>We must do something about cheating, and for my part going forward, *I don't want to play against people who have cheated repeatedly in the past, because I don't know what they are capable of doing in the future*.\n\nMagnus is clearly saying that he suspected Hans because Hans has cheated in the past--therefore, Hans's history of cheating is incredibly relevant, because that is a big part of the basis behind Magnus's suspicion. Is it defamatory to suspect that a past cheater could have cheated again? Of course not.\n\n>You don't know how any of this works because you're not an attorney.\n\nAnd neither do you. If you were an attorney, I would hope that I didn't have to sit here quoting laws to debunk your factually incoherent comments.\n\n>Now you're resorting to saying I'm not an attorney when the article is published under my real name and my credentials are public record, which would have taken you a minute to confirm. Like Carlsen, you simply could not be bothered to investigate before making accusations.\n\nYou're revealing your bias at the end there.\n\nIn truth, I have no idea whether you're qualified as an attorney or not. But I highly doubt you have experience in this, and if you truly are an attorney, then I'm stunned and embarrassed for you. The truth is, I have no idea who you are. I could verify the identity of the person who wrote that article, but I have no way of verifying some guy on Reddit wrote that article. I could tell you that I'm Hans Niemann and this is my lawsuit. You could verify that the lawsuit is from Hans Niemann, but you could never verify whether or not this anonymous Redditor is Hans Niemann without using logic and relying on likelihoods. I feel like it's unlikely you are an attorney, due to your painful lack of knowledge of the law. I think it's unlikely that you wrote the article because you contradict it sometimes and also completely miss when I'm quoting from it. However, both of those things are possible. You could be an incompetent attorney who wrote the article and don't remember/care about what you wrote. The only thing I know for fact about you is that you are incompetent, lying, biased, or some combination of all three. Hans doesn't have any basis in this lawsuit. Even if you disagree with what Magnus has done, it just doesn't legally amount to defamation, and from Hans's lawsuit I think he knows that too. It's a smear job with lots of emotive language designed to muddy the waters, create doubt, and share Niemann's narrative. You can support Hans and still be aware of reality.\n\nI'm becoming a bit wary of how much time I'm investing in this, because debates with Reddit experts generally end in the \"expert\" deleting all of their comments.", "created_utc": "1666704284.0", "edited": "False", "id": "itpx5xo", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_yarer8", "parent_id": "t1_itpgupf", "score": "2", "subreddit": "chess", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhr7"}, {"author": "nonbog", "body": "But different.

But it\u2019s not viable in my opinion for Hans to prove that Magnus acted with malice and made knowingly false statements here.\n\n> Actual malice is a showing Carlsen made his defamatory remarks with actual knowledge of falsity or in reckless disregard as to whether his statements were true or not. Niemann must allege there is sufficient evidence to sustain the conclusion Carlsen \u201cin fact entertained serious doubts as to the truth of his publication.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not viable to prove this, because what Carlsen said was perfectly reasonable, and a lot of other players suspected it. One of the subjects of the lawsuit complain that Magnus said he doesn\u2019t want to play with someone who has cheated in the past.

But I think it\u2019s okay to hold it over his head right now seeing as he\u2019s still benefiting from it (cheating in those games raised his rating, his streaming figures, etc) and that he\u2019s lying about it. If Hans came out and was honest, then we\u2019d all be happy for him. Everyone wants to see a redemption arc. But there isn\u2019t one, not while he\u2019s lying and minimising the extent of what he did. I also get the impression he is a typical cheat. He\u2019s an egomaniac. Lots of cheaters are egomaniacs because when their lived experience doesn\u2019t match up to their view of themselves, they cheat to reconcile the two.\n\nAbout the \u2018cheating gene\u2019 thing, I put it in quotation marks because I don\u2019t think it\u2019s so simple as a \u2018gene\u2019. But I\u2019ve noticed that people who cheat at things tend to repeat it, and tend to view competition and games very differently to people who don\u2019t cheat. For example, you have the reason you don\u2019t cheat at scrabble anymore as that you don\u2019t view it as importantly as you did when you were young. You literally cannot comprehend the idea that the majority of us don\u2019t cheat because we just don\u2019t want to win like that. What pleasure is there in winning if you cheated? You didn\u2019t earn that, so what\u2019s the thrill? Nothing. People cheat, in part, to boost their ego. To look good in front of other people. Hans is obsessed with looking good and is an archetypical cheater. I do hope he grows up and focuses on chess instead of his image, but it seems silly to say he\u2019s done that already. Man\u2019s such an egomaniac he refused to give money to charity on the basis of being a GM. It might be hard for you to believe, but I can promise you it\u2019s true, most of us genuinely never even consider cheating. There is literally nothing to gain from it. And if you cheated for monetary gain then that\u2019s borderline fraud\u2014taking money from people under false pretences.\n\nI don\u2019t think any less of you for the cheating thing, by the way. I just think that people are motivated by different things on a deep level. Some people are more motivated by the fact of having won than they are by actually winning, and those people see cheating as a way to get that.

Our MPs gallivanted around partying while our parents died and we struggled to get treatment in a barebones NHS.

Maybe your professor is a class A. Asshole with stupidity thrown in. But I think it\u2019s more likely that your professor either didn\u2019t really say this at all (what was the insinuation? You\u2019re intentionally being unclear) or that they have good reason to believe you *have* plagiarised.\n\nWhat\u2019s interesting to me is that people with ego problems often cheat. I suspect that it\u2019s because they feel the need to win or succeed in things in order for their outward appearance or match the way they view themselves inwardly. As someone with experience with narcissists, I know this to be very common. In chess at the moment, if anyone here follows it, an egomaniac called Hans Niemann recently got called out for cheating, denied it passionately, and then got outed by a 70-some-odd page report.\n\nMy point is, I honestly get the vibe you might have plagiarised. At least, your ego problems are clear just from this post, and you probably want to look at yourself objectively before getting all mad about this. Looking through this lens, your anxiety and panic after being accused make much more sense.\n\nIf you\u2019re telling the truth\u2014you haven\u2019t plagiarised and your professor genuinely accused you of cheating (as opposed to you overreacting to some perceived \u2018insinuation\u2019)\u2014then you make a formal complaint to the university. It\u2019s unprofessional, discouraging, and borderline libellous to accuse someone of plagiarism without a good reason. At the same time, it\u2019s weird for that to happen because universities have very good software for detecting plagiarism, and plagiarising creative writing would be very, very easy to prove. If your professor said \u201cthe plot of this reminds me of Poe\u2019s Tell-Tale Heart\u201d, that\u2019s not an accusation of plagiarism, it\u2019s a sincere interpretation of your story. If your professor said \u201cthis isn\u2019t your story, you stole this from Poe!

He has good grammar and his sentences are easy to listen to without getting lost. He also uses the monomyth, which is a literary device\u2014you probably haven\u2019t heard of it if you don\u2019t read real literature\u2014which all real literature comes from. Tolkien uses the monomyth well which is why he\u2019s popular but his prose is really bad. Sanderson is using the monomyth just as well as Tolkien, but his prose is perfect.\n\nPeople just pretend to like Joyce because his incomprehensible sentences make people feel clever. It takes so much more skill to write a clear sentence like those found in Mistborn and Harry Potter.\n\nEdit:\n\nI also forgot to mention that Sanderson teaches at uni because he\u2019s a literary.\n\nFrom a standpoint of literary theory and criticism, Sanderson is maybe the best writer we\u2019ve had in the whole of history.", "created_utc": "1665545695.0", "edited": "False", "id": "irz9kdh", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_y1pryc", "parent_id": "t1_iryryl2", "score": "68", "subreddit": "bookscirclejerk", "subreddit_id": "t5_2sioj"}, {"author": "nonbog", "body": "Can you make an audio version?

He still played really nice at points, he played an offbeat opening that leads to a forced disadvantage. Hans apparently studied that opening that morning, so he played the opening perfectly, leaving with an advantage. And then Hans just managed to keep everything accurate to close out the game. Magnus still played well, his opining was just refuted. And people keep trying to downplay Hans\u2019s game too, Hans also played great.

If you can, you should pick it up and work through it!\n\n\nEdit:\n\nThis sentence is medium length. This sentence is slightly longer than medium length. This sentence is short. All of the sentences I\u2019ve written here are boring. Varying the length makes it better. The sentences are still boring though. But if you start varying your syntax\u2014like this!\u2014the sentences start to take on some character. Sentence length is probably the most important factor to this, but randomly throwing in fragments and long sentences isn\u2019t always the best idea. Some of the best writers in history have almost exclusively used long sentences comprised of multiple phrases. How do they do that? They vary their syntax. See Charles Dickens or Jane Austen for wonderful examples\u2014far better examples than I could ever muster. Sometimes, it\u2019s good to throw in some prepositional phrases. But you also want to have some nice strong declarative statements to balance that out (like this one). And sometimes, as long as you don\u2019t abuse it, you should throw in subordinate clauses!\n\nWhen you read, pay attention to how the grammar effects the way you read the writing. Lots of subordinate clauses can come off as ponderous and old fashioned\u2014great if that\u2019s what you\u2019re going for, bad if it\u2019s not. Lots of dashes can create a torrential effect\u2014great for tense moments in your story, bad for slow-paced rumination. Short sentences can be strong. They can give your writing a pointed edge. Using lots of conjunctions can connect clauses and create a cool effect and stick out to the reader and draw them in or push them out and other times it can become syntactically confusing and then other times it can become incredibly powerful (see Hemingway). Sometimes, fragments can create a cool effect. Listen. Reading out loud can help you develop this ear, but if you\u2019re a native English speaker you probably already have it, you just need to hone it. The sentence length is just the most visible part of what\u2019s going on. Sometimes, long sentences seem short, and vice versa.

Avoid anything which could make the writing pleasant. Don\u2019t worry about repeating yourself again. The syntax should be boring and plain. All you need is a subject and predicate. Don\u2019t bother messing around with syntax. The syntax is what creates the rhythm. Keep the syntax the same and you\u2019ll bore everyone. You can also bore people with length. Keep on writing until their eyes glaze over and they start to skim. And if you want to be interesting again, it\u2019s simple. Just add variety. Your syntax should have a fun, rhythmic pace.

Secondly, anyone online can claim to be a mathematician, this analysis is done by someone who actually works as a data scientist, rather than just someone who pretends to be a mathematician and then blocks people who call him out for it. A sample size of 4 is not ideal, but the reason for that sample size was clear to anyone with common sense: to compare Hans against people in a similar time, playing similar opposition, with similar opportunities for development. It would be easy to run the test with a higher sample size but you\u2019d likely get odd results if you tried that, and unless you\u2019re careful about who you include, it\u2019s a false comparison and doesn\u2019t prove anything anyway.\n\nPretty telling that he refers to me as \u201cthis guy\u201d knowing that he was planning to block me afterwards. Ironic he accuses me of lying while blocking me to stop me from answering another comment which is literally nonsensical.\n\nIf someone replies to this and he unblocks me to see, I double-down, this person is either not a mathematician at all, or he is a bad mathematician who is intentionally lying because he likes Hans. Either way, he\u2019s certainly an idiot. Anyone with an argument they believed in would be willing to subject it to argument. This person can\u2019t even do that.

The Lottery is a popular favourite, I personally really like The Missing Girl (I think it\u2019s called). You can\u2019t go wrong with Shirley Jackson though. Grab *The Lottery and Other Stories* and also *Dark Tales* and almost every story in them is brilliant.\n\nNow, for your question about horror literature, I think a resounding *no*.\n\nHorror literature is telling a story about humans pushed to their absolute limits. Sometimes, horror can be lazy and pulpy, but just as often, horror can be deep and insightful while also being entertaining. Some of the best writers in history, Charles Dickens, Henry James, Shirley Jackson, Daphne du Maurier, Faulkner, etc, all of them either dabbled in or wrote excessively in the horror genre. It\u2019s a hard genre to write. Any unreality of the characters will stick out like a sore thumb, and the plot has to be strong yet sensible\u2014especially if there are supernatural elements. Of course, horror has bad writers, but it has a long and noble tradition, and many of our modern writers who work in it are doing some excellent things. To be honest though, I\u2019d argue a similar thing for all genre writing: look what Kazuo Ishiguro did with sci-fi and fantasy with *Never Let Me Go* and *The Buried Giant*. Genres aren\u2019t bad, writers are. There are often great writers in every genre, but publishers think that they won\u2019t appeal to the audience and so shovel them on to a different genre, or academics can\u2019t accept that this fantasy novel is actually good literature (as in the case of *The Buried Giant*) and so refuse to give it their stamp of approval.\n\n\nEdit:\n\nI also want to make another suggestion. This isn\u2019t really \u201ccritically-acclaimed\u201d in the sense you mean, but Uncle Montague\u2019s Tales of Terror by Chris Priestley has stories which are delightfully creepy and sinister in this beautiful modern Victorian style. They\u2019re aimed at a younger audience, but creepy even for an adult. On top of that, they\u2019re *so* well written. I\u2019ll swear it to the day I die, *Uncle Montague\u2019s Tales of Terror* is a short fiction horror classic.", "created_utc": "1664705286.0", "edited": "1664705621.0", "id": "iqqe53e", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_xsxi75", "parent_id": "t3_xsxi75", "score": "2", "subreddit": "literature", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhps"}, {"author": "nonbog", "body": "I love MR James.

But there is plenty of strong circumstantial evidence that gives me a 90% suspicion that Hans *is* cheating.\n\nFirstly, Hans conveniently prepped an obscure line in the morning before his game against Magnus in Sinquefeld. With this prep, he outplayed Magnus, likely the best player to ever live. When asked questions about this line he prepped that morning, and understood so well he could beat the world champion, he faltered and couldn\u2019t answer any. He couldn\u2019t remember what games had been played in it (even going as far as to make one up), and couldn\u2019t give any side-lines. So he says that he studied the exact moves Magnus made and that\u2019s it. The morning before playing the world champion, he studied a line the world champion doesn\u2019t play and doesn\u2019t even bother to study any side-lines for that line. It\u2019s not definitive proof, but it\u2019s obviously incredibly suspicious.\n\nThen we have this post. Hans once again studied the line \u201cthat morning\u201d and riffed out a load of perfect moves to avoid traps in an incredibly sharp opening to the point where he outpreps somebody who has literally just finished writing a book on that line. Hans has a curious habit of studying the exact correct prep \u201cthat morning\u201d. I wish I had his coaching team, to know exactly which moves to memorise from the computer.\n\nThen, his confession. He admitted to cheating on two occasions\u2014the two occasions he knew of where he had already been caught\u2014then chess.com revealed they have evidence of further occasions of cheating and that they\u2019ve sent the evidence to Hans, then we have silence. If Hans didn\u2019t cheat, why is he lying about his confession? Why is he lying about studying the prep in the morning? How is he suddenly playing so well against the top players in the world?\n\nIt\u2019s all circumstantial, but circumstantial evidence is enough for strong suspicion.

This person seems to not realise than \u201copening prep\u201d isn\u2019t one monolith area of the game. You do opening prep in set openings to work on your game. Magnus didn\u2019t just play \u201cthe opening\u201d he played a very specific and rare opening that would be incredibly unlikely for someone to have taken the time to specifically study. Hans spend half his clock in the opening, and played perfect moves. Afterwards, he said that he had studied this specific line that morning, and that\u2019s why he played perfect moves. He named the game and date that this line took place in, because he knew it would look suspicious for him to have prepped such an odd line. There\u2019s three big issues with this: One, it\u2019s such a rare line, the odds of him studying that line that morning are approaching lottery odds. Two, he spent half of his clock on the opening, and then afterwards he said he was still in prep. If he was still in prep, he would likely have played much faster. Thirdly, and most importantly, the game that he apparently studied that morning wasn\u2019t played in the obscure line, and after this came out, he completely changed this story. So the fact of it is, Hans played perfect moves to an incredibly obscure line, and then gave incorrect information about where he saw that line *that very morning*. It would be incredibly weird for Hans to mistake details of the game but remember the incredibly obscure line perfectly, and even weirder still for him to study that line in preparation for Magnus, who doesn\u2019t play it. It\u2019s also weird that he then changed his story and started raging about transpositions.\n\nNone of this means that Hans definitely cheated. He could genuinely have studied that line and maybe somehow got confused about where and when he studied it. Maybe that\u2019s why he took so long to whip out the prep. The weird thing is why he\u2019d then lie about studying it in that game, that morning. It\u2019s not enough to say: Hans is cheating OTB. But it\u2019s enough for Magnus to become very freaked out and, given that he already thought Hans was cheating, add it on to the existing heap of evidence he has.\n\nThe stupid thing about the comment above was his weird idea that studying \u201copening prep\u201d means you study every opening ever.

The best thing to do is understand *why* you think King is dull and *why* you think Riesling\u2019s post-HP work is shit. For example, I learned a lot from the way King handles his paragraphing. He\u2019s underestimated as a stylist, in my opinion, and much of what makes his work gripping is actually his style, hence why he\u2019s able to write stories with such vague concepts that end up being gripping. Rowling, on the other hand, well, there\u2019s lots to say about her but I think the touches of verisimilitude sin the HP series is what makes it so enjoyable for me to read\u2014as an Englishman, it reminds me of my own time in school, and my friends and the things we did and the teachers and the mannerisms of the people. It\u2019s really enjoyable for me for that reason, and there\u2019s something satisfying about the cyclical nature of a year, and she leans heavily onto that structure, at least for the first six novels.\n\nAll of that being said, the only advice I\u2019ve really seen from Stephen King is that you must read a lot and write a lot. That\u2019s pretty much the only advice there is without a large dollop of bullshit, so yeah I would advise following his advice.\n\nI think Heinlein\u2019s rules, which have been repeated by Stephen King, George RR Martin and Neil Gaiman\u2014just to name a few,\u2014 are the best rules to go by and the only real advice that you *need*:\n\n1. You must write\nYou\u2019ll find that most people say they want to write, then they do a whole lot of thinking about writing and not a whole lot of actual writing. This narrows down a good chunk of people.\n2. You must finish what you write\nAnother large chunk of the people who survived the last fall-off point never finish things. They are the authors of a million beginnings and middles and fragments and unedited first drafts. You must finish things, or you\u2019ll never improve.\n3. You must send out what you write\nYou just try to market what you write by sending it out. A manuscript in a drawer will never sell itself.\n\nI\u2019m going to add two of my own rules here, for reasons I\u2019ll explain:\n\n4. You must revise what you write\nThe main importance of this is that it teaches you what worked and what didn\u2019t in the writing process, and you\u2019ll do better next time. Writing a novel and revising it will teach you more than a life time of writing classes with world-class lecturers.\n\n5. You must read a lot, and widely\nWithout knowing what has been done, what is often done, and what can be done, your writing is bound to come out as juvenile and weak. Reading teaches you what works and what doesn\u2019t. It also helps mature you as a writer. If you haven\u2019t read a lot, it will show in your writing.\n\nBut feel free to disregard everything I said. Writing is a weird profession, and there\u2019s a hint of magic to it. The main thing is just to do it and to live it.
