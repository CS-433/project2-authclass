You can have poor mental health from various reasons that aren\u2019t PTSD. Anxiety and depression alone are not PTSD. There are other diagnoses that are more fitting.

I played the xp race game for a bit when I first started. Now I don\u2019t care anymore. But here is the trick I used.\n\nStart a new language. Only complete the first unit. Now go and do the lightning rounds for that language. The questions will be basic as you have only done one unit. Something like Greek with the first unit dealing with very limited vocabulary and the sounds the Greek alphabet makes.\n\nSo find an 2x XP boost and slam out those lightning rounds as quick as you can. I was able to do a round in under two minutes. This is 80xp per round. If you have prefect lesson bonus available buy that with your gems and now each round is worth 120xp if you get it perfect. Getting them perfect is easy after getting used to the questions as it\u2019s such a basic level.\n\nWhat I would do is work on my target language until I completed a lesson and got an xp bonus. Then quickly switch to the Greek language and hit the lightning rounds for 15 minutes. I would easily get 1000xp in that 15 minutes. Times that by 5-6 xp bonuses and you can easily get 6000+ xp in a few hours. I did over 15,000xp in one day once. Spent a good part of a rainy day just playing on duo with this technique.\n\nThen I realized that you don\u2019t have to be the top person in the league to advance. Sure you get some gem bonus, but who cares. As long as you go up a level it doesn\u2019t matter. People are advancing with 1000-2000xp for the week, sometimes even less. There\u2019s no point in going on xp runs unless you only want to use this app as a game.
