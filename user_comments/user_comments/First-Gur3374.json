[{"author": "First-Gur3374", "body": "He has been studying musical theatre, classical singing and instruments and acting since he was a kid. He did National Youth Theatre and Music Theatre in the UK (which is kind of like an acting and singing school there). Plus the school he went to since he was a kid is known for its specific education in the arts (performing and otherwise). Interestingly in the method acting context, Daniel Day Lewis went to the same school. So I am sure their theatre and music department (that\u2019s how Jamie knows all the voice modulation techniques) is insane. I also think Jamie has his own take on method acting where he does intense research and does immerse himself but not to the extent that he can\u2019t get out of it while talking to people around him in real life - like it\u2019s mostly in his inner world and he has control over it.
