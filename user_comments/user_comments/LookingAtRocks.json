My background is mostly in hazards analysis.  These days it's more geographic data science.  But just to give you a perspective of where I come from.\n\n1. I have mapped trails both as a professional and as employment.  I used to be part of a group that mapped local MTB trails and worked on incorporating an interface with which users could report problems, trail conditions, difficulty, connect to groups, etc.   We used recreational GPS since precision wasn't paramount.  \nAs a professional I worked with BLM, USFS and USGS in the US Government.  With BLM and USFS I mapped trails that needed work, post wildfire/flood/etc impacts.  For legal reasons this needed to be more precise; we used Trimble Geos (iirc).  The slot canyon is from personal experience, we weren't mapping the trail but mapping a profile for sedimentation rates and water quality in the river.  \nYou need higher precision when mapping near private land, but for the most part an accuracy of 1-2m will cover all your bases.  But I'd have to ask if this is for fun or you have a business need?  If you don't have a business need, I'd say stick with the cheaper GPS units and see how far they take you.  If you plan on making money, the more expensive GPS is going to be the way to go. \n2. Most devices I know of have an export to CSV function that will get the data off of it.  As a GIS person this is really all I need.  They all have specialized software you can get, but since the majority of survey application is in civil engineering, it's not really useful to someone like me.
