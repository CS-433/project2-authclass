Just as you would expect in any country there are good and bad people, racists and non racists, but I don't need to explain the details of that to you. I have experienced racism myself here, and the Chinese flavor of it is a little different to what you may expect. You see, here's the thing, Chinese people in general don't understand racism the way we do as westerners, and this is due to the fact that 99.9% of Chinese people grew up in extremely racially homogeneous places, the only racism they have learned about is when the yanks exploited them to build the railroads and the atlantic slave trade.\n\nNow I will tell you a little story to demonstrate. When covid hit, I took a girl to restaurant for diner, this was last June, so things were OK in China by then, but really bad overseas. After a few minutes of sitting down, the manager came over and asked me and my date to move seats, into a back room. When I asked him why, he said it was because some people noticed there was a foreigner in the restaurant and they were scared of covid. Neither the manager of my date cold understand why I was so annoyed by this, and when I explained that I do not take kindly to being racially profiled the manager told me \"Oh no, its not a racist thing, its just because you are a foreigner\". Like I said, the understanding of racism is different here, because no one really grew up experiencing it, being around people of other races is a relatively modern phenomenon for most people here, and different people have different reactions.\n\nNow on the other hand, I had a very enlightening conversation with some friends at the gym a while back in which they informed me that many young people see African Americans as victims in the same struggle against capitalism, and their circumstances are brought about by a system that oppresses them, citing movements like BLM as noble kicks in the face to the capitalist establishment, and quoting several black rights movement leaders as revolutionaries. \n\nI have had times where I have been denied a rental contract because I was a foreigner, it doesn't matter that I am fluent in two Chinese dialects, I am still a foreigner, for some people it will never be good enough. Then there's the little things, too many to name. But the main thing is that most people here are generally welcoming. I feel terrible when I here people have had bad experiences here in China, worse when these experiences are co-opted by anti-China agitators as some kind of evidence of China being oppressive.\n\nI have plenty of Chinese friends here, and they treat me as an equal, not as an outsider.", "created_utc": "1625137755.0", "edited": "False", "id": "h3o4l0r", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_obhic1", "parent_id": "t3_obhic1", "score": "77", "subreddit": "communism", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qolz"}, {"author": "dbrown1990", "body": "Ladies of the night as you put it are illegal in China, but as with most countries it operates under the radar, and the police wont take huge steps to stop it unless it is blatant.

I will tell you a story.\n\nAround 10 years ago I attended language meetups in my home city, which attracts a lot of international students from Asia. Many of these students were from Japan, which was great because that was my chosen area of study at the time. A few weeks in and I was well acquainted with everyone, and making these new friends was really improving my language skills. \n\nA quick preface, I gained initial interest in the language due to what may be considered *weeb shit,* from the girl I was dating at the time, but once I found the deeper nuances of the culture and made Japanese friends my interest in the surface level pop culture waned drastically, and I realized the language spoken in a lot of the media I consumed was a childish caricature of the proper tongue.\n\nBack to the language meetups. One evening we were at the bar chatting, 30 or so Japanese/Koreans and maybe 5 or 6 locals. Out of nowhere, I saw my first weeb. This guy a little younger than me walks in wearing a ghastly yellow wig and a *Naruto* headband, it was dark but I am fairly sure he was wearing weird contacts as well. He entered the circle of my group and hit us with his best konnichiwa. Several of the Japanese around were obviously feeling a little awkward, and I was actually a little embarrassed for the guy.\n\nThe conversation was rolling in Japanese for a minute or so until he interrupted me and asked me how I learned it, I listed off the books I used, internet resources, etc. Then he asked what animes I liked, to which I replied I wasn't really into anime, and if I consumed Japanese media its usually dramas, or anything with Hiroshi Abe in it. He was visibly taken back by this statement, and asked me point blank *Then why are you learning Japanese?* At this point the Japanese guy next to me interjected and informed him that Japanese culture is about a lot more than anime and manga. The weeb asked the Japanese guy if he watched anime, and when he responded in the negative, along with the rest of the group, the weebs entire world view came crashing down. His face went red as a tomato and he quickly left, we never saw him again, and I honestly still feel back for the dude.\n\nA weeb isn't someone who likes to watch anime, or read manga, there is nothing wrong with doing either of those things. It is a particular person who believes what they see represented in this form of media is an accurate depiction of what modern Japan is like, and can only see Japanese culture through the lenz of anime and manga.

I've often seen people getting angry at Chinese wait staff for not understanding their questions.\n\nHonestly, it became embarrassing to hang around other foreigners here because this attitude was so prevalent. The worst part was when I really hit the mandarin hard and started to make Chinese friends, other foreigners would make quips such as \"*Oh, so are you like a try hard Chinese or something now?\",* if I received a compliment on my use of Mandarin someone would chime in to knock it down.

Think of that scene in *Planet of the Apes.... He can talk! He can talk!!!*  \n\n\nThe other thing is, being in an Asian country, a lot of people want to *make friends with you*, but under the pretense of a language exchange.

Quite often I am walking on the street and some random will approach me, enthusiastically asking for my wechat and if I am from America. If they speak in English, I just start speaking in Chinese, once again hit with the *wow your Chinese is so good* etc.. Then a request to help them with English. While it sounds like a reasonable request on the surface level, I am not one to start a friendship on some mutually arranged contract of free language education, I do enough teaching at work, the last thing I want to do is help my *friend* correct his university homework in my down time.  \n\n\nYes sometimes language learning can suck, I have a friend who never bothered to learn mandarin, and since Chinese people have a thin filter around people who they believe cannot understand thier language, perhaps he is better off not understanding some things.

The situation in Xinjiang has improved drastically since the CCP starting making security a priority and breaking up terrorist cells. Many of these terrorist cells now have fled to Syria and Iraq to fight for ISIS. I have a close friend who grew up in Urumqi, he is now in his 40's and married to a Han Chinese woman, he said being in Urumqi now compared to his youth is like being in a completely different country.  \n\n\nThere is neither incentive to or proof of a muslim genocide in Xinjiang, the western countries pointing the finger at China's counter terrorism activities can only do so with bloody hands, millions of dead muslims owe their fate to western governments. The majority of these stories about alleged atrocities come from anti CCP sources linked to the Falun Gong cult, CIA backed independence movements and/or US owned weapons companies. Hypocrites of the highest order.  \n\n\nThe US has an interest in spreading disinformation due to its losing global dominance. This is the same misinformation spread by \"red scare\" politicians a generation ago. The US government cannot play the game fairly, so they spread lies about thier competition.   \n\n\n*Of course, it is impossible that the Chinese government could be anything but evil, right? After all, they are our main competition. Remember, US needs to stay dominant forever.*\n\nI hope you all have a chance to visit China one day and realize the lies spread about it are exactly that, falsehoods perpetuated by jealous western elites struggling with the fact they will soon lose power.

I understand the issue is very sensitive, but please keep in mind the Uighurs of China are doing fine, regardless of what the US backed media wants you to believe.", "created_utc": "1610280350.0", "edited": "False", "id": "gir987f", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_ku3nrn", "parent_id": "t3_ku3nrn", "score": "-3", "subreddit": "madlads", "subreddit_id": "t5_3aegn"}]
