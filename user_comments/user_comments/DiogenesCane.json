A solid 70% of youth in Texas are bootlickers who are absolutely aroused by the idea of cops exercising their power. I reckon no more than 30% of youth here are that way. \n\nPeople here tend not to be absolutely fucking brainwashed the way Americans are, which is why identity politics is non existent here. \n\nExample: just because someone is religious doesn\u2019t mean they vote for CDU or something. Just because someone hates immigrants and is racist doesn\u2019t mean they vote AfD, hell they might vote for die Partei, die Linke, or Die Gr\u00fcne. People just do their own thing and vote based on whatever they care most about. \n\nAre some europeans overly smug about the fact Europe is better than the US?  Sure, and most of those people are liberals, and most liberals are overly smug no matter where they live. That\u2019s the nature of having all the power yet existing in a failed ideology, you gotta cope mad hard all the time.\n\nAre the cops here assholes? Absolutely. Are they better than American cops? (This can\u2019t be a serious question). I have had friends and family beaten blue and killed by cops in the US. It happened maybe once a year, and that\u2019s just people who I know. I got fucked over by asshole cops on more than one occasion, and had a gun pulled on me for \u201cspeaking aggressively\u201d. Meanwhile, I have seen my drunk German friends here shouting and spitting in the faces of cops and the cops did little more than raise their voice by 3 decibels.", "created_utc": "1665854987.0", "edited": "1665855671.0", "id": "isftbkz", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_y4lafi", "parent_id": "t3_y4lafi", "score": "5", "subreddit": "Anarchism", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh5j"}, {"author": "DiogenesCane", "body": "If you manage to keep a mouse alive for 2 or 3 years, they\u2019re bound to get cancer.

English is filled with false friends, and has a very rigid word order compared to German. For an English speaker attempting German, you basically just gotta get the gender correct and speak Hochdeutch and you are most pf the way to passing as a native speaker if your accent is decent. For the reverse, a German native must learn to use the rigid word order of English, and must focus on speaking a specific type of English (usually british or american), and you have to nail down some semblance of an accent which most likely won\u2018t sound native unless you specifically try to learn to speak RP. Next, you\u2018d need to nail down the rigid word order of English, which is damn near impossible when you consider things like adjective heirarchy.\n\nAnother issue which likely applies to both is the existence of idioms, expressions, and names which are common to many European languages, but which are mysteriously different in English. People love to make fun of German for \u201eKrankenhaus\u201c, but every single German knows to word \u201eHospital\u201c. Dissimilarly, the word \u201eMuskat\u201c is almost exactly the same in every european language besides english, where for literally no good reason, we instead say \u201enutmeg\u201c. \n\nThen there are other bizarre issues where Americans perceive non-anglosphere speakers to have poor English because they learn British English and use words like Aubergine (which are more universal amongst European languages), but Americans instead use words like Eggplant.\n\nEven further complicating the matter is that English has some of the worst spelling on the entire planet. It\u2018s awful, only rivaled by French and Tibetan (strange bedfellows). We may as well be using a logographic system at this point. \n\nEnglish also has several bizarre features which are quite rare amongst the worlds languages. https://youtu.be/LQEzTcLH27U", "created_utc": "1665269793.0", "edited": "1665270474.0", "id": "irkfm9y", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_xyv9wg", "parent_id": "t3_xyv9wg", "score": "0", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "DiogenesCane", "body": "The face plus details about the clothing makes me think she must either be Italian, or from a country to the east of Italy which would require her to transit through Italy to venture to America.

Cancer is not one disease, it is hundreds of them. Even if you find a perfect treatment for one, you have not addressed most types.\n\n2. Cancer cells are human cells. Things which are poisonous to them are therefore poisonous to all of you. That means treatments must be more sophisticated than the normal way we treat aggressive invasive cells like bacteria.\n\n3. Cancer cells come from \u201cprecancerous\u201d cells. Even if you come up with a sophisticated way to kill all the cancer cells, you probably aren\u2019t killing their parents, since they behave more or less like normal human cells\n\n4. A single precancerous cell may eventually give birth to a whole zoo of different cancer cells in the end, each of which have notable differences between one another. This means that one instance of cancer arising leads to a disease which is potentially unique to the individual patient. Coming up with a way to treat all of those at once without failing for the reasons mentioned in 1. 2. and 3. is, frankly, impossible.\n\nFrom here out, the rest is opinion and conjecture. Cancer will never be cured. It could be prevented, but prevention technology is centuries behind treatment because of the way we approach medicine in academia and industry, and the way that we let profits drive innovation rather than the other way around. Moreover, prevention would likely involve editing the human genome, and this is not going to happen under good faith for a long time. Humans are simply too corrupt and foolish to be trusted with that, but we are at least smart enough to know that and thus we have basically put a moratorium on editing out babies in vitro. I have no doubts that if humanity survives the next few hundred years without collapsing or sustaining major losses, and if we get rid of our puritanical world views (neither of these two conditions are likely), then we could prevent most cancer before it ever happens, which is the closest possible thing to a cure we could ever get.", "created_utc": "1655322427.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ichtej2", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_vd2k50", "parent_id": "t3_vd2k50", "score": "1", "subreddit": "explainlikeimfive", "subreddit_id": "t5_2sokd"}, {"author": "DiogenesCane", "body": "Butt rock is coming back with a vengeance for sure", "created_utc": "1655148283.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ic8m6gt", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_vbjy9f", "parent_id": "t3_vbjy9f", "score": "21", "subreddit": "musicproduction", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rfyt"}, {"author": "DiogenesCane", "body": "Despite the negative press, Uzbek", "created_utc": "1655026533.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ic2k8og", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_vadru6", "parent_id": "t3_vadru6", "score": "1", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "DiogenesCane", "body": "Well, I\u2019m also young and Frisian is dying.

Basic fluency doesn\u2019t mean that you can follow everything, it doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re a master. It doesn\u2019t mean you have fully internalized the grammar and used it properly. Really, it just means you can hold basic conversation.

For you, it could take two years or more to reach basic fluency unless you dedicate significant time to it. Even then, you\u2019ll spend years more to achieve higher levels.

There is stuff like creative writing and poetic storytelling and legalese which are whole beasts within each language and which themselves take years to conquer.\n\nIf you want to see more progress, I would recommend that you start learning as many verbs as possible.

The problem is that you are running 20 fetches and 30 shocks.\n\nAt 540, that frequency allows drafters to make 4c 5c mana based way too frequently, and then you have other fixing on top of that! Remember, fetch lands are 5 color lands when mixed with shocks. \n\nSome simple changes: \n\n1. Cut down fetches to one of each fetch.\n\n2. Cut signets, not only are they above the general power level of most of the cube but they further enable 4c 5c by skirting color requirements to access two more colors. I could see replacing them with stuff like [[coldsteel heart]], which fits better for the power level and could be used by any deck\n\n3. Less fixing overall. I think you should cut the signets and one set of fetches and replace them with monocolored cards. Test this out and see if it works, I think it might, and its a very simple revision to make.\n\n4. Search for cards of each aggro guild/wedge/shard which operate similarly to [[flinthoof boar]], these kinds of cards make drafting 2-3 colors aggro more appealing, and that makes drafting 4-5 color battlecruiser risky. \n\n5. Tri color cards should be absolute bombs to reward drafters for playing 3 color. Animar and Butcher of the horde are great bombs.
