Because I\u2019m no Sheikh and therefore have no right in imparting a personal analysis on exegesis, here\u2019s an excerpt from Dr. Ahmad Shafaat\u2019s (Islamic scholar & mathematician) writings[Islamic Perspectives](http://www.islamicperspectives.com/quran-4-34.htm):\n\n\n\"beat them or separate them (from you)\". \nIf even suspension of sexual relations fails to work, then it is suggested that men use dharb. This word has almost universally been translated here as \"beating\". Such a translation is supported by some passages in the Qur'an where the word does mean smiting or striking (2:60, 61, 73, 8:12, 50, 7:160 etc). \nBut in many other Qur'anic passages there are other meanings of the word. Thus the word can mean constructing or coining something such as coining mathal or similitude (14:24, 16:75-76, 30:28, 36:27 etc). \nThe word is also used to separate two things. In 20:77 it is used of the splitting of the sea to make a way for the children of Israel to escape and in 57:13 it is used of making a wall to separate the two groups of people in the hereafter. Leaving, withdrawing or taking away is the meaning in 43:5. In 13:17 the word is used of separating truth and falsehood. The word can also mean campaigning or traveling in the land, e.g., for the purpose of trade (2:273, 73:20). \n\nIn the present context, the Qur'anic usage allows two meanings: 1) separating from the wives in the sense of living apart from them, 2) beating them. The Arabic language also allows a third meaning: 3) have sex with them. The first meaning fits the context well, for some kind of physical separation is a very understandable step after suspension of sexual relations does not work. The second meaning is more natural from a linguistic point of view and has the support of a strong consensus among the commentators. The third meaning has no support in the Qur'anic usage. In the rest of this commentary, we consider the question: how is \"beating\", if that is what is intended in the verse, is to be interpreted in the light of the passage as a whole and the general teaching of the Qur'an.\n\nIn this connection, it must be immediately noted that there is no warrant here in this verse for wife battering. The suggestion to use beating is made specifically to deal with nushuz on the part of the wife, that is, to deal with her deliberately nasty behavior that poses a threat to the marriage. Beating is to be done after due admonition and suspension of sexual relations and therefore by husbands who have some moral standards and have sufficient control over their sexual passions. Moreover, this beating is not to go on and on but is to be tried as a last step to save the marriage. \nOnce it is clear that it is not working it is to be abandoned in favor of some other steps involving relatives of the husband and the wife mentioned in the next verse (4:35). There is therefore, absolutely no license here for the type of regular and continual wife beating that goes on in some homes, where each time the husband is angry with his wife or with someone else he turns against her and beats her up. \nIn most such cases, the husband has no moral superiority over the wife: the only rule of Shari'ah that he cares about is this suggestion about beating. He also does not have the kind of control over his sexual passions needed to separate the wife in bed and often beats her the day before or the day after making love to her, an action specifically condemned by the Prophet.\n\n*End of excerpt*\n\nHere\u2019s another excerpt (tafsir) by Ibn-Kabir on \u201cDealing with the wife\u2019s ill-conduct\u201d[An-Nisa:34](http://www.recitequran.com/en/tafsir/en.ibn-kathir/4:34) and what the prophet has to say about it:\n\nMuslim recorded that Jabir said that during the Farewell Hajj, the Prophet said;\n\n(Fear Allah regarding women, for they are your assistants. You have the right on them that they do not allow any person whom you dislike to step on your mat. However, if they do that, you are allowed to discipline them lightly. They have a right on you that you provide them with their provision and clothes, in a reasonable manner.) \n\nIbn `Abbas and several others said that the Ayah refers to a beating that is not violent. Al-Hasan Al-Basri said that it means, a beating that is not severe.\n\n*End of excerpt*\n\nI *strongly* advise you to visit the websites, it goes through all the details.\n\nI\u2019ve included the Prophet(SAWS) as he is an exemplar of islamic faith we Muslims deeply respect and that Allah(SWT) commanded us to model our actions after.\n\nSide Note: I think it not necessary to be faithful to literal translations if the meaning is clearly conveyed; Some words are polysemic as we all know and I believe using a phrase, rather than a word allowing much room for interpretation is favorable i. e., no ambiguousness. Ergo, the sources that have changed aren\u2019t lying or appealing to the west. Simply, \u201cbeat\u201d is a word with the connotation of physical violence & \u201cdiscipline them [gently]\u201d is a more appropriate substitute.\n\nAnd you\u2019re indeed correct when pointing out the absence of the word \u201cgentle\u201d in the Quran.\n\nI believe \u201cscourge\u201d shouldn\u2019t be an accepted translation since it\u2019s definition, as a verb, is: \u201cto cause great suffering or a lot of trouble\u201d. (Source)[Scourge Definition ](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/scourge?q=Scourge) Which is prohibited, as mentioned above.\n\nSecondly, the part where you illustrate how some sources turned to a euphemistic translation when addressing disbelievers doesn\u2019t hold, for the following reasons:\n\n1) The original Saheeh international translation matches the last one you\u2019ve provided(I hope you\u2019ll kindly cite); \u201c(wild) donkeys\u201d in Arabic is (\u062d\u0645\u064a\u0631 \u0648\u062d\u0634\u064a\u0629) or (\u062d\u0645\u064a\u0631 \u0628\u0631\u064a\u0629), a direct translation is: Zebras.  The Arabic equivalent is used by all speakers in case you were curious, it\u2019s not a literary exception. So there\u2019s no issue here, though I invite you to provide more compelling examples of derogatory terms used to designate disbelievers.\n\n2) The terms from A. J. Arberry, Abdul Haleem, Abdul Majid Daryabadi, Abdullah Yusuf Ali, Abul Ala Maududi, Ahmed Ali, Ali Quli Qarai, Hamid S. Aziz, Maulana Mohammad Ali, Mohammad Habib Shakir, Mohammed Marmaduke William Pickthall, Tafsir jalalayn[\u201cAss\u201d in translation ](https://qurano.com/en/74-al-muddathir/verse-50/) those who used the word \u201casses\u201d in their translation have a very good reason to do so; they unfortunately failed to see how such words could be perceived by an American or English speaking audience when there\u2019s a complete disregard to the word\u2019s etymology. You may notice some who have substituted the term for another, resulting in far better clarity of meaning.\n\n\u201cAss\u201d has 2 senses, n.1 donkey, n.2 stupid person (Hard to believe, I know). (Source)[Source of \u201cAss\u201d](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/ass?q=Ass) the 1st being old, not very popular and the latter being an *informal* american word making your comparison faulty by definition, since accepted quranic translation never use informalities. In fact, the formal & informal definitions of \u201cass\u201d have both completely different etymologies[\u201cAss\u201d etymology ](https://www.etymonline.com/word/ass) but funnily enough ended as the same word.\n\nErgo, not an insult. Though they could have done a better job at it. Also, would you kindly cite the verse for \u201cpigs\u201d.\n\nRegarding the debate, I think you should rather be cautious of the interpretation of exegesis you do, and cite more. Those charged of the translations should make the copies more accessible and less obscure, because the point of it all is a patent understanding of the text. I can\u2019t stress this enough, when scriptures display little rigor in their translations, groups such as ISIS, Boko Haram & Taliban exploit those weaknesses to their favor. \n\nCriticism is always welcome in my book, I greatly appreciate your post.", "created_utc": "1605814192.0", "edited": "False", "id": "gcuz0kc", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_jx524w", "parent_id": "t3_jx524w", "score": "1", "subreddit": "DebateReligion", "subreddit_id": "t5_2snuc"}, {"author": "Candide_h", "body": "I think she misunderstood morality\u2019s function, attributed another one to it, and wrote this.
