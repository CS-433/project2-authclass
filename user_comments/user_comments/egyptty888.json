I don't have friends from home, but I have them in college. When I'm home, I feel like I'm in high school again where I do nothing with anyone. It's a rough feeling because my family gets the brunt of my anger/anxiety expressed in other ways. I want to move out and live with friends from school elsewhere.\n\nI love my friends (see above), but about 1/2 of them are nerdy. We do nerdy things that I do enjoy though I don't consider myself nerdy. It's fine, but they have prevented us from having girl friends that hang out with us on a regular basis. They are more socially awkward in that regard, so they tarnish anyone else who is there that is not nerdy. 1/2 of us (not the same 1/2) like to drink alcohol. We'll do it every weekend to some degree, but we don't do it \"out\". We just drink in the dorm, which can be fun, but I want to meet girls. All my friends will talk about wanting to get married but they do nothing about it. All this makes me want to find other people to do this shit with.\n\nThis also relates to my friends. I go to a religious school, though I'm not religious in the slightest. They are religious though, and some want to wait until marriage for sex (I don't). I don't care, they can do what they want, but I feel like they slut shame people too much (guys less to but included). They'll casually say \"be gone thot\", which I've never repeated because I believe if people want to have sex with different partners it's their choice. Them saying this could just be mainly as a meme, but there is some truth to them thinking that because of their own religious beliefs.  They'll call guys \"chads\" which is significantly more mundane than calling girls thots. It's this possibility of it being a meme that I haven't said anything because I know I'd be in the minority over something that would turn into an actual religious argument. It pisses me off though especially because I'd like to have sex.", "created_utc": "1577073187.0", "edited": "False", "id": "fbtayv2", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_ee3b1i", "parent_id": "t3_ee3b1i", "score": "1", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i"}, {"author": "egyptty888", "body": "NAH.
