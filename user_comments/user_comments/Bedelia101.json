Getting more rooted in the meaty, meaningful aspects of living as the Spanish speaking you may give rise to a natural, organic amalgam of phonological tendencies that blend into each other in complementary ways.

The text based learning is easier for most people and it sounds like you\u2019ve made progress there because you have enough vocabulary to be bothered about not being able to hear it or use it well enough in conversation. Well done. :) Listening skills are usually the hardest part for most people, because native speakers talk at regular conversational speed and mush words together. If you want to be able to interact with native speakers, then I would prioritize listening skills and pronunciation skills. The pronunciation skills will make it easier for others to understand what you\u2019re trying to say. It\u2019s easier for most listeners to understand your message even with defective grammar or word choice, than it is for them to decipher your words through bad pronunciation. There are many resources online for improving listening skills and improving your pronunciation. \u201cMinimal pairs\u201d are helpful for both listening and pronunciation. For pronunciation, I like two other resources: Pimsleur audio (which you might be able to check out online from your library) and the Mimic Method website, which has free material online for many languages. For listening skills, I recommend setting your bar very, very low at first. The purpose of a tiny goal is that tiny progress points build on each other and keep you moving forward. You can isolate different parts of listening. For example, you can notice individual words such  \u201cque\u201d or \u201cd\u00eda\u201d and notice it being said or sung 8-10 times. There are beginner level stories available. You can listen to You Tube videos at super slow speed (without subtitles, at first). Choose a 10 second segment to play repeatedly and notice what sounds or syllables you can hear and maybe even hear words. After doing that several times, look at the subtitles to check how closely your hearing matches whatever was said. This might seem ridiculously tiny at first but it is an effective baby step toward eventually being able to run with the natives. Little by little, your ability to hear what they\u2019re saying improves. Then later, you can hear whole phrases like \u201clo que dice\u201d or other word chunks that frequently go together (collocations) or another exciting thing is when hear a word that shares the same root as another word you know such as hearing \u201colvidado\u201d when you know the word \u201colvid\u00e9.\u201d That\u2019s just a sample.

I\u2019ll describe what I do and why it works for me. Maybe you\u2019ll see a little of yourself in these scenarios. I\u2019ve noticed that anyone I\u2019ve read about who wants to learn multiple languages uses several approaches together.\n\nI\u2019m pursuing Latin American Spanish (as opposed to European Spanish which has some differences in pronunciation and verb tenses).\n\n1. I\u2019m using the Fluent Forever app. It\u2019s a flashcard type app that includes audio recordings and facilitates the process of creating flashcards. It supports rapid learning of vocabulary in the context of sentences. The grammar isn\u2019t taught overtly but instead is gleaned intuitively via the sentences. There\u2019s a book about the method that encourages use of certain kinds of books, but the app is pretty far reaching so I haven\u2019t picked up a grammar book yet. When I\u2019m wondering about a verb conjugation or some other question about grammar or meaning, I research things on google translate or on several websites such as SpanishDict. At some point I might hire an economically priced tutor via italki as recommended by the Fluent Forever book.\n2. The other program I\u2019m using is Pimsleur. One of the best things about Pimsleur is that it helps you develop a really great accent. The other thing I like is that it\u2019s audio based. This means I can do it while driving, jogging or doing housework. I don\u2019t have to look at flashcards. Another great aspect is that it prompts you to produce on the fly and speak in the target language. Also since you control the audio, you can pause the recording or play it repeatedly until you can hear all the words spoken at a natural cadence. Can you imagine asking a live teacher to repeat something to you 5 or 6 or more times? Or holding up a class while you practice saying something 11 or 12 times until you\u2019re satisfied that you sound natural? For me it complements the FF app well because it provides more structure and has an incrementally progressive flow in a predefined sequence of lessons. \n\nOne of the criticisms of Pimsleur is that there isn\u2019t much vocabulary but I\u2019m compensating for that in spades by using the FF method in tandem.\n\nBoth methods provide immediate feedback and correction on what you\u2019ve just done. That\u2019s key for keeping an ADHD person engaged. Both methods use a variation of \u201cgraduated interval recall\u201d or a \u201cspaced repetition\u201d system. These are effective at getting vocabulary and other things you\u2019re learning into long term memory so that they eventually become second nature to you. So because you see progress, that\u2019s engaging too.\n\n3. I\u2019m starting to use audiobooks and will start watching movies or TV shows in Spanish. There are two reasons for this: so that I can train my ear to hear the words when they\u2019re spoken at regular conversational speed; and so I can internalize the natural rhythm so I can sound less monotone and halting when speak.\n\nI took off a month of study while visiting family traveling this summer but since March until now, I\u2019ve had four months of daily study for about an hour per day (usually less) 6 or 7 days per week. Remember that part of that time is audio-based so I\u2019m getting other things done. (Great for us fidgety types.) Also, now that I found a combination of methods that works well for me, I\u2019m enjoying it. I\u2019m not having to force myself to do my lessons. At this rate, I think I can reasonably reach a high intermediate level or even better by Christmas.", "created_utc": "1565924467.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ex0x72l", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_bxtiw0", "parent_id": "t3_bxtiw0", "score": "1", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "Bedelia101", "body": "Me gusta leer y escuchar las palabras de otras estudiantes de espa\u00f1ol porqu\u00e9 usan las palabras y frases que puedo entender.

The purpose is mostly a matter of practicality rather than stuffy correctness, especially for English speakers.\nFor one matter, knowing correct pronunciation makes it easier to recognize and learn new vocabulary in conversations and audio recordings, and to acquire vocabulary through reading. For another matter, if your pronunciation is correct, then native speakers are more motivated to speak with you in the target language. For Americans anyway, we want to avoid sounding American because often the speakers of our target language are eager to switch to English so that they can practice their own target language of English.\n\nFor those who are interested, it shouldn\u2019t take more than 3 weeks to learn how to make the right sounds for the most commonly understood accent if you find a decent pronunciation training method, It could take a little longer if the differences in sounds are vast between the starting language and the target language.\n\nFrom what you said, it doesn\u2019t sound like you experience much practical benefit from the amount of effort that it seems to take to perfect your pronunciation.

My point is that whatever your constellation of feelings are about these relationships, it\u2019s beneficial to listen to all of your feelings, identify your values and beliefs, and give yourself a gigantic helping of kindness as a way to untangle yourself from the grips of depression.
