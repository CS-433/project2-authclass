I was more interested in Chukotko-Kamchatkan, specifically Itelmen, mainly because of it's interesting phonology. It still interests me a lot but there are no grammars I'm aware of available in English, and like Ket, the English-Itelmen vocabulary lists are sparse at best.\n\nAnyway back to Ket, I did a bit more reading about it after hearing about the hypothesised Xiongnu-Hun-Jie connection. Anyway after my interest in it grew, it's difference from the surrounding languages really gripped me, which is something of a common theme in my language interest (given I'm studying Hungarian lol), the tonal system that it has, unlike it's neighbours, it's complex, prefixing verbal morphology unlike any other around it. The absolute mess of truncation and insertion rules when conjugating the verb is fascinating, if not a complete pain in the arse. I really enjoy the sound of the language as well, at least what little there is available on the internet. The way that the verb has been influenced by surrounding languages to make the P7 incorporate the most semantically important part of the verb and therefore make it de facto a more suffixing verb (like those surrounding it), with the original root of the verb having its semantic power eroded is something that really interests me. Another big thing is the fact that it is such a small (and declining) language, it always seems to inspire some sort of a desire to preserve it, especially Ket with regards to it's potential importance to historical linguistics. Another factor is Edward Vajda's fascination and enthusiasm with the language, I've watched most of the videos of his about Ket on YouTube and his enthusiasm really rubs off. The more I've watched of his discussion about the Den\u00e9-Yeniseian hypothesis, the more it seems realistic, I'm of course no expert, but I would say that Vajda's correct about it, which is of course would be a fascinating discovery.\n\nKet culture, at least the historical Ket culture is really interesting to me as well, it's just a shame that the language is so isolated in every sense of the word, it has no known relatives, it's incredibly unconnected to the modern world or Russian society at large, and most of the best resources are either inaccessible, or in a language I don't speak. My desire to learn Ket is actually fuelling my desire to learn Russian, solely for the purpose of learning Ket lol. I do have a copy of Georg's descriptive grammar though, and a Ket-Russian dictionary (which has it's issues as I've mentioned before).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI think that pretty much sums it up. It's just a shame there are not any Ketologists in the UK.\n\nPS- you're right about Ket verbs, they are an absolute nightmare. I can't remember who it was, but it was one of the early linguists who worked in that area (Castr\u00e9n perhaps), who originally thought that every Ket verb was irregular lol. I don't blame him.

First of all there\u2019s the fact that having a monarchy, especially our monarchy, makes us stand out in the world, it\u2019s part of what makes this country unique. There\u2019s also the historical/heritage aspect of it, in a country that is increasingly losing its cultural heritage, doing away with the most identifiable symbol of this country would be a mistake. \n\nThe ceremonial role that he monarchy performs as head of state is incredibly valuable, in many ways because of its deep history. Having a banquet with the Queen holds more weight than having a banquet with a president, for example. Having a non-partisan head of state is also beneficial for preventing division in the country. Yes you can argue that there are countries like Germany where the president is pretty successfully an apolitical figurehead, but there are hundreds of other examples where this isn\u2019t the case, and do you think in a country with a political climate like ours a president wouldn\u2019t be just another constant source of division and scandal? Also I can\u2019t remember where I heard it but someone said that the British monarch is kind of like the equivalent of Uncle Sam. It functions as a representation of the country, as a sort of national personification, and having the prime minister go weekly to the palace to bow before the queen is quite a nice idea to me.\n\nLess important is the fact that pretty much the whole honours system of knighthoods and damehoods hinges on the monarchy.\n\nThere\u2019s also the fact that the British constitution is entirely built around the Crown. I\u2019m sure this could be changed in the event of abolition, but it wouldn\u2019t be easy, nor desirable.\n\nIf the monarch went the House of Lords would probably go with it. I understand that it\u2019s a somewhat controversial institution, but it helps to put a check on government power without taking any power from the elected house. Either way, that is a different debate from this one here :)\n\nI won\u2019t go too deeply into the economic arguments, like when people bang on about \u2018oh but it brings tourism\u2019 yeah I get it, I\u2019m sure it does, but there\u2019s a lot more to it than that. As far as the cost of the monarchy is concerned, it is effectively self sufficient, with the sovereign grant being much less than the income from the Crown Estate and the Duchy of Lancaster.\n\nIt always gives the Daily Mail something to write about on a slow news day :P\n\nThat\u2019s pretty much what I can get off the top of my head anyway.

On a serious note though, town developments should be done with the deepest regard to the human spirit, streets should be walkable, the pedestrian should where possible be at the heart. Architecture should be traditional, that\u2019s not to say it should be necessarily old-fashioned, but it should fit with traditional architectural styles and regional variances. Buildings and town squares and high streets should have charm, they should be places where you can feel inspired by, not oppressed by the architecture. Tower blocks should be used as little as possible. Spaces should be mixed use, no more residential areas and commercial areas, blend the two, make shops walking distance. I have taken a great deal of inspiration from Prince Charles\u2019 own views on the matter which I very much agree with.\n\nA) Much greater emphasis on physical education for children, 1 hour of sport/exercise a day.

It wasn't a studio take, the words you see him singing are the ones you hear. He never cut a studio take of Unchained Melody, the version released on the Moody Blue album was again an overdubbed recording, from April 1977, Ann Arbor MI. The video posted by the commenter is from the same show as OP's video, albeit earlier in the show (Unchained melody was the penultimate song and Are You Lonesome Tonight? was I believe the third, or maybe fourth). The professional audio of the preamble before the version of Unchained Melody has not yet been released, so the secondary, worse sounding, 'soundboard' tape was used to provide the audio, and the multi-track tapes (plus overdubs) are used for the song portion.
