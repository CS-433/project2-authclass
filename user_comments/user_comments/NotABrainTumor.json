You have 6 attempts technically and I remember 1 or 2 programs requiring all scores reported though this is still rare.\n\nRegarding the South- I am in the south and I believe so. I met applicants nationwide and the autonomy and case volume in the South is unparalleled. But what drew me to OMFS was the hospital and OR stuff so I am biased. 95% of programs will train you to pull out wisdom teeth, basic implants, ORIF mandible/facial fractures, orthognathics, and safely sedate patients- that is what the vast majority of oral surgeons will be doing in private practice. If you want to do frequent le fort 3s, cranial vault reconstruction, Halo distractions, microvascular oncology, etc. then you need to go to specific programs and will probably be an academic affiliate of some sorts after you graduate.\n\nThings to do before residency- After match day ( Jan 24,2022), they gave me a month to study and retake the CBSE, then another month to prepare and take Step 1.
