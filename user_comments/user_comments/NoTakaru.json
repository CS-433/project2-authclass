The entire margin of error is a 95% confidence bound. So there\u2019s a 95% confidence that results will fall somewhere within those bounds, but those results have a normal distribution centered at a place that still has Kemp winning. By your logic, it\u2019s just as possible that Kemp comes out ahead 53.4-41.6\n\nTo actually calculate the odds of Abram winning you would need to take the overlap of the two where Abrams beats Kemp and divide that by the likelihood of every result. To do some rough math, Abrams would win with an additional >2.5% in her favor that leaves 0.9 of the 3.4 MOE on Abrams\u2019s upside where she wins. That 0.9 is just 13.2% of the full 6.8 error range (3.4 up and 3.4 down), so of the 95% confidence interval that the MOE consists of only a relatively small portion of that is in Abrams\u2019 favor. \n\nIt\u2019s actually even smaller than 13.2% because these odds aren\u2019t evenly spread because they have a normal distribution centered around Kemp winning 50% of the vote like I said earlier, so those odds drop off as you get closer to the error bounds, if we take 3.4 to be the 2 sigma bound, 1 sigma is 1.7 so Abram\u2019s win is from like 1.5 sigma to 2 which corresponds to 95% minus 86%, so a 9% chance that Abrams wins based off this poll\n\nIt\u2019s still a \u201cstatistical tie\u201d because there\u2019s not confidence that Kemp will win, as in his wins don\u2019t fall entirely within the 95% confidence interval. Of course, this is all assuming the pollster is determining MOE close enough to reality to account for their real sampling bias", "created_utc": "1651245813.0", "edited": "1651246381.0", "id": "i6ocnic", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_uemjtf", "parent_id": "t1_i6o62yo", "score": "10", "subreddit": "politics", "subreddit_id": "t5_2cneq"}, {"author": "NoTakaru", "body": "Yeah, like the other comment says, this is from Skinny Legs and All by Robbins", "created_utc": "1651175589.0", "edited": "False", "id": "i6kpb3h", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_ue10qs", "parent_id": "t3_ue10qs", "score": "6", "subreddit": "WeirdLit", "subreddit_id": "t5_30f4c"}, {"author": "NoTakaru", "body": "You can run even if you\u2019re not 35.

To insist on calling social democracies \u201ccapitalist\u201d when they have a high percent of social ownership, and unions have significant presence in the public and private sectors to advocate for workers, doesn\u2019t really make sense to me. It\u2019s clearly a form of mixed economy where private control of the economy has to constantly fight against a strong working class.
