Same goes for popular trainees (sorry Momo), the judges aren't going to pick someone just because they're a fan favorite. If Momo impressed the judges off screen though, then it's definitely possible.\n\nThat being said, I think Hyerim or Jia for K-group. Hyerim showed her chops singing at a high level and leading her team to victory. She also showed that she can learn from her mistakes from Chaehyun's feedback. I'm obviously biased though since she's my #1, so take that with a grain of salt.\n\nJia has the most potential as a brand new trainee and did well in both of her performances. I don't think they will save Bora, Seungeun, or Dayeon because all of them performed below the judges expectations. \n\nNo clue about the C and J groups. Maybe Xia Yan.
