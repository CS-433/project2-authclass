I'm 39 now. \n\nMother knew she wasn't supposed to have kids due to kidney failure, and so there was a whole lot of problems there, to the point that I was an emergency delivery, and Dad was asked to pick who they worked harder to save if things went south, as the hospital looking after mother's kidneys were not equipped for neo-natal needs. Dad only ever wanted a girl, so I'm the only child. No close cousins or anything like that.\n\nMother has never been well, though she got a transplant when I was 12, but she was never able to do things with me. I never did after-school things, because she didn't have the energy, and Dad worked 7 days a week. So she was never a 'mother' to me, and as a result we are not close, but she expects me to be at her beck and call. She's been back on dialysis for 4 years now, and now expects the world handed to her on a platter as a result.\n\nDad was always at work or asleep. I'd beg to go on some of his jobs, just to spend time with him. I'm Daddy's girl 100%. But years of stress, smoking, and neglecting his health, means he had a stroke in December, and is now physically incapacitated. \n\nI'e worked for him for 16 years or so, but now I am his primary carer, and I have to run his business, manage his staff, and look after his other interests. He's no longer allowed to drive either, so that's on me, as mother can't lift his wheelchair in and out of the car.\n\nShe also has the attitude that he's just being lazy, and he could walk better if he wanted to. Or that his incontinence from the stroke is something he does just to make her life difficult. \n\nThen she will complain that I don't make at least the same amount of effort for her that I do for him. If I do do something for her, I get a condescending \"Oh, good girl!\" from her. Or I get accused of things I didn't do. That's more common.\n\nThere was finally talk of me moving out and getting a place of my own - we had meetings with real estate agents - but that never went anywhere, and has now been completely forgotten. \n\nNow, I can't move out even if I could afford it on less billable hours. If anyone falls over or takes ill, mother is quite deaf, so cannot call emergency numbers (but not deaf enough to use Auslan, or TTY systems), and there is no possibility that she could assist Dad in getting off the floor - she just ends up yelling at him.\n\nI've never dated. I couldn't bring anyone home - even if there was a chance than someone would want to come home with me. So I can also see that when I get to their age, I will not have anyone to care for me. All my friends are busy raising kids, or are sick themselves.\n\nI've missed out on most of my 20s and 30s 'milestones'. It's been at least a decade since I had friends come over for an evening. Hell I can never even have the house to myself. My only time alone is the drive to and from work (when Dad doesn't come with me), or after I've put him to bed at midnight, until 3am.", "created_utc": "1666764694.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ittp1cl", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_ydnj20", "parent_id": "t3_ydnj20", "score": "5", "subreddit": "AgingParents", "subreddit_id": "t5_31k4q"}, {"author": "Misrabelle", "body": "Paper plane, is what I always thought...", "created_utc": "1666762715.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ittmew4", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_yd1ah5", "parent_id": "t3_yd1ah5", "score": "1", "subreddit": "Sims4", "subreddit_id": "t5_2x5o7"}, {"author": "Misrabelle", "body": "I can smell this picture.", "created_utc": "1666762048.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ittlhji", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_yd4e0p", "parent_id": "t3_yd4e0p", "score": "1", "subreddit": "food", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh55"}, {"author": "Misrabelle", "body": "How long is a piece of string?\n\nSadly, for everyone it is different.

This is a story and a half!\n\nI went to Hawaii with two girls I'd been to school with - who happened to be twins - and one girl's partner. \n\nApart from the fact that they wouldn't talk to locals, eat street food - really anything that wasn't fish & chips, pizza, burgers, pasta, chicken schnitzel or garlic bread. All activities were booked through the hotels, and we stuck to the main touristy places.\n\nIt very quickly became clear that I was just there to make up the numbers so one person didn't have to pay a single supplement. If we bought drinks and snacks for the rooms, the three of them would put in together, splitting the costs, but leave me to buy my own. When we had to queue for complimentary souvenir mugs, one girl said \"I'll get ours!\", and came back with three, leaving me to queue for my own while they queued for food.\n\nThey'd wandered off shopping together, when I'd been told that we were splitting up to get the last of our souvenirs faster, then they got to our lunch spot early, and had a go at me for being three minutes late on the agreed time.\n\nI remember sitting in the coach on the way back from outlet shopping, when the sister I was sharing a room with, sitting next to me, leaned forward to her sister and said: \"It's so unfair, you have your boyfriend here, and I have no one\".\n\nWe'd literally just been talking. I was *right there.* \n\nI was torn. I knew if I pulled her up on it, I'd be the world's biggest b!\\^%&, and the whole situation would become worse. Both of them would ignore me - or try and tell me it was my own fault, because that was their usual response to being called out on their rudeness. But at the same time, I was tired of their crap, and we were on holiday.\n\nSo I said: \"Hi, remember me? The person you're sharing a room with? I'm sitting right here, I can hear you...\" She stared at me wide eyed, stammered, saying: \"Oh. I forgot about you.\" \n\nI was ignored the rest of the drive to our hotel.\n\nA few days later, we went kayaking. As we were finishing the dryland briefing, the same sister, walking in front of me, talking with her twin, said \"At least you get to sit at the front. I have to sit at the back and do all the work, because *she's* useless.\", as she nodded her head back towards me.\n\nI really wanted to say something again, but I'm not a strong swimmer, and I wouldn't have put it past any of them (especially the boyfriend), to tip our kayak over deliberately. So I shut up. \n\nPlus they both spoke a family language that neither the boyfriend or I understood. Those conversations could have been had, so that I wouldn't have known what was being said, but they obviously didn't care.\n\nThe boyfriend overheard a conversation at dinner between my room mate and I about assisted reproductive technologies, and took whatever I was saying to mean that I didn't want to be on the trip, and my parents had forced me to come. My room mate never once tried to correct him. She just shrugged.\n\nSo from the girls' reactions, he realised they didn't care about me at all, and he could abuse me, swear and yell at me, throw things at me; generally just be an absolute pig towards me, and neither his girlfriend or her sister would step in and tell him to stop.\n\nSo for the rest of the holiday, he did just that. He'd mock my words, even when those words had been said in a private conversation that he wasn't involved with - obviously the girls were both telling him everything. \n\nWe went to the beach, and when I'd sit in the shade because I burn easily, he started throwing rocks or sand at me, thinking I didn't realise who was doing it. \n\nKnowing I'm into cars, and a professional driver, he offered both sisters the keys to our rental Mustang, but mocked me when I put my hand out for them. \n\nWhen I explained how four-way stops work, because he wasn't sure, he slammed his fists on the steering wheel and told me to \"shut the F%&( up\" because \"I didn't f\\^$#&\\^g ask you\". \n\nCrossing the road somewhere, I made a comment about someone nearby, who was doing exactly the same job I do - and had done for a few years - and who I could see had miscalculated what they were doing and about to get stuck. He started yelling at me - loud enough that other people noticed - \"what would you know?! You think you're some expert, I used to work in a similar job, I know more than you! Keep your f$@%\\^\\*# mouth shut!\". \n\nSure enough, the person got stuck, and had to go back and have another go at it. Hardly even the point; it was a meaningless observation, but he couldn't let it go.\n\nWhen I pulled his girlfriend aside later, and asked her what his problem with me was, she shrugged. Then had the audacity to tell ME to stop aggravating HIM, because SHE didn't want to deal with his foul mood. \n\nApparently he was upset that his parents hadn't called or texted or left messages for his birthday (either on the day in the US timezone, or on our home timezone), so instead of acting like an adult, he decided bullying me was the way to go.\n\nThe end of the holiday couldn't come fast enough. I was more alone, surrounded by those people, than I ever have been on my own. Even in places I don't speak the language.\n\nOn the flight home, they checked in together, thereby getting three seats together, and I ended up several rows away, on my own.  Jokes on them: It was actually *really nice* to forget they were there for a while. Once we got to baggage claim, they got their things, and left me to wait, and find my own way home, as my family hadn't come to get me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI didn't hear from them for a few weeks, but suddenly my ex got a friend request from one of them. He didn't think anything of it, and accepted. Then, I got a message from one of the girlfriend's profile, obviously written by the boyfriend, so I knew who'd sent the request. \n\nBecause I blocked him, he was using her account to stalk my social media. When I pointed that out publicly, the message was deleted. \n\nWhen I was later invited to their house, I again pulled his girlfriend aside, told her that I wouldn't put up with his crap anymore, and she needed to have a word with him, or else I would start fighting back, and he wouldn't like it. She smirked when I mentioned his use of her profile to stalk me and my ex... and her response was, I guess, the permission I finally needed to walk away, and never see them again.\n\n\"Why would I do that for you? He's my boyfriend and you're *nothing*.\"\n\nI'd *known* that for 14 years. Their behaviour had told me that many times over, but they *said* the opposite. Kept inviting me places when it suited them. Finally she'd admitted it, so that night I left their house, and we haven't spoken since. 11 years.\n\nI was made out to be jealous, of course: They'd bought a house, they had boyfriends, careers, etc. The mutual friends didn't ask questions, because that would be too uncomfortable. \n\nI got a disposable camera film developed while we were away, and looking through the photos, one stuck out. From the kayaking trip. On a beach. The four of us: Sisters in the middle and the boyfriend and I on either end. The three of them have their arms around each other, turned in together. While the sister standing next to me has her shoulder turned inwards, away from me, and her arm down at her side. It reminded me of an earlier photo, on our previous Thailand trip, so I dug that out. \n\nIt was a mirror image. The sisters were swapped around, as the other sister had her boyfriend on that trip. But again, the sister next to me, shoulder closed, arm down, turned away from me.\n\nThe photos scream: *She's not one of us.*", "created_utc": "1663694323.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ip7vsmc", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_xj2oj7", "parent_id": "t3_xj2oj7", "score": "6", "subreddit": "solotravel", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rxxm"}, {"author": "Misrabelle", "body": "No", "created_utc": "1663601146.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ip2p1ms", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_xi8lz9", "parent_id": "t1_ip2k6wq", "score": "2", "subreddit": "Scams", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qrt0"}, {"author": "Misrabelle", "body": "They\u2019re not, funnily enough.

Reports received to date recommend replacement of the deteriorated roof structure.\n\nAs a repurposed former aircraft hangar, the Rink\u2019s roof structure is over 80-years-old.\n\nLast year, a structural assessment determined that the existing roof structure would not support additional solar panels unless the corroding steel beams, impacted by heavy condensation, were replaced.\n\n \n\nISCNSW had commenced planning in line with Canterbury Bankstown Council\u2019s redevelopment of the Leisure and Aquatic Centre next door by engaging architects and structural engineers to prepare plans to replace the roof structure and other works.  \n\n \n\nCanterbury Olympic Ice Rink is an iconic recreational sports facility in Sydney that was opened in 1971 as a co-operative of volunteers and has remained so for its 51-year history.

I'm currently 39...\n\nWhen I was in Kindergarten I was the girl the boys would refuse to hold hands with in case they got \"fat germs\". I was always the one left over when anyone had to pick teams.\n\nBy 5th-6th grade I would be nominated for things as a joke, so that I would then have to stand in front of the whole class and have absolutely no one vote for me.\n\nWent to an all-girl high school and thought that perhaps I would just be ignored, but by the end of 10th grade, a friend of mine mentioned that the girls on her bus often said really nasty things about me. Girls I didn't even interact with! She then refused to tell me what they were saying because she thought it would have made me cry. This conversation happened after a handful of girls groaned when our music teacher said I was joining the school orchestra. None of them played the same instrument; and I still never interacted with them.\n\nBy the time I finished school and got a job, I'd forgotten how to interact with boys my own age. I was (and continue to be) the girl that is one of the boys, not a potential love interest. I absolutely could not talk to/look at anyone I found attractive. I was so worried they'd realise I had a crush, and laugh at me.\n\nOnce puberty hit, it was clear things were going from bad to worse. My best friend told me I should have been born a boy, but obviously \"something went wrong\". My Grandmother, and parents all told me to lose weight constantly. At my 21st, my Grandmother asked (in front of everyone gathered) how I \"ever expect to find a husband, looking like that?!\" So that was fun.\n\nMother would buy meal replacement shakes because her \"friend\" told her about them, and I should try it. Or she'd buy Nair, and leave it in my toiletries container as a hint.\n\nEven girls I thought were friends, and to whom I'd spoken about my PCOS and it's problems, didn't care. In fact they either laughed, when their partners cracked jokes at my expense, shrugged when they complained about my appearance being disgusting, or outright made the jokes and complaints themselves. Once they told me that \"of course\" I slept with the first person to show me any interest, because with my body/looks I can't be too fussy, and had to take whatever came my way. We are no longer friends.\n\nI've had men chat to me in pubs, only to try to get an introduction to my friends. I once had a coaster thrown at me, with the number for a local animal shelter, and advice on what to do if you found a stray. (Not the first time I'd been called a dog, but it was the most creative!)\n\nWhen I finally, accidently, met someone online, we hit it off right away. Chatted for hours a day, for months. Decided to meet.... and (as I had expected) he was disappointed.\n\nThe one and only time I told him I loved him, he looked into the distance, and said \"yeah, me too\". I only realised years later that he wasn't reciprocating...he was *agreeing* with me... and that was when he was still pretending to give a shit about me!\n\nHe asked me to lose weight. I tried, but ended up putting on more. \n\nHe still used me for \"practice\" to build his confidence sexually, and discarded me when he realised that he didn't find me attractive, and couldn't get past it. Only to suggest that we could still hook up until he \"found someone better\". Only if it didn't inconvenience him too much, or cost him much money. I'd fly to his city, hire a car, sometimes accommodation, and meet him for a weekend. He'd complain that I should be there on a Tuesday instead, so movie tickets would be half price.\n\nWhen I met his brother and a friend, his brother nodded in my direction and said to the friend \"What a turd!\". The friend realised I had heard, and did not reply.\n\nWhen I mentioned I had hirsutism, his response was \"Don't show me. What has been seen, cannot be unseen\". Months after dumping me he sent an email, explaining that had we met \"traditionally\", he wouldn't have given me the time of day, as I wasn't physically his type. He also outlined all of the things I should \"fix\" about my body, **if** I was ever going to have sex with someone else - because he didn't want me embarrassing myself. Yep. That was a fun email.\n\nI've since seen him refer to me online as a \"cheap, fat, mistake\". Good times. Nice guy.\n\nIt's been so long now since I had feelings for anyone, that the entire concept these days, makes me uncomfortable. The last time we were together was catastrophic, (for years I assumed I had vaginismus), but I think it was just the universe's way of showing me in no uncertain terms, that this wasn't healthy.\n\nThese days, I accept that these situations aren't for me this time around, and that's ok. I don't miss it. I'm not a kid person either, so I don't feel that pressure at all.\n\nIn fact I realised recently, that no one ever asks me \"Are you seeing anyone?\", anymore. At this age it's usually \"Are you married?\" Or, \"Do you have kids?\", but I don't get those questions either, and haven't for at least the last decade.\n\nDad continued to ask \"When are we going to lose some weight?\" \n\nWhen I didn't remove my beard for a while (like during lockdown), he got actually angry with me, and threatened to shave it himself. Since his stroke, he's stopped that.\n\nOn the plus side (surprisingly there is one), I never get catcalled or followed, or have random men come up and make me feel uncomfortable. I travel on my own, and move about the world completely unseen. Other women don't get catty with me for talking to their partners, because they know that I'm not a threat. I'm good at my job, I get taken seriously in managing a business, in a very male dominated sector. I'm a good daughter and friend. If my weight/shape/hirsutism stops people from approaching me, then it's weeded out the riff raff for me. Mostly, I haven't had to find out the hard way that I'm not compatible with these people.\n\nThe people I DO have in my life now, genuinely don't care about it.\n\nThe only thing that is going to be a problem in the future is that I'm the last one in the family. Once my parents go (they're both 70s and unwell - mother has kidney failure), I'm on my own in the world. If I get sick, and as I age, there will be no one to care for me the way I currently care for them, and so I'll have to plan ahead of time accordingly.", "created_utc": "1663340353.0", "edited": "1663345540.0", "id": "ioo8x2s", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_xfl4i3", "parent_id": "t3_xfl4i3", "score": "18", "subreddit": "PCOS", "subreddit_id": "t5_2ryc6"}, {"author": "Misrabelle", "body": "Ugh.

I think they're going to try and repair some of the termite damage to the built-in, and the electrician, who I thought was a kid, but apparently isn't, has taken control of the lighting in my room. WIFI/RGB ALL THE THINGS!! I love his enthusiasm, but I feel sorry for him having to get up into the roof cavity all the time. \n\nThey brought us breakfast this morning to make up for getting me out of bed early.\n\nTonight I - and half my things - are bedding down in the spare room. They hope to be done with my room tomorrow, but I know they wanted to get someone to steam clean the carpet, so who knows. Might be back in by the weekend. Maybe. \n\nLounge room is next biggest job, and then a few cracks to be patched where the cornice has pulled away from the walls, then finish painting. \n\nSo far, I've managed to please everyone with the colours I've picked, so we'll see how they feel about my room....", "created_utc": "1660137450.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ijpqqd7", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_wksoao", "parent_id": "t3_wksoao", "score": "3", "subreddit": "sydney", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qkob"}, {"author": "Misrabelle", "body": "Lacunar strokes can be a little harder to detect, but they do still show up.

When I later said \"Hey, you know you said you'd come with me to this...\", I was told that if I actually believed that, then I was more gullible than they thought, and they never had any intention of actually doing it. \n\nTheir partners would make fun of my medical issues, and they'd laugh. Not once did they ever say \"hey, don't do that\", as a good friend would do. They'd crack jokes about my appearance too, knowing full well that there was a medical reason for it, which I'd been open about discussing with them. But any empathy was apparently expecting too much.\n\nAnyway, around the time we were 24-25 we went overseas, and one of the girls brought along her boyfriend of a few months. He overheard half a conversation I was having with his girlfriend's sister, misunderstood what we were talking about, and spent the rest of the hoilday antagonising me, yelling at me and throwing things (twigs, pebbles, sand) at me when I wasn't looking. He very quickly realised that the girls weren't doing anything to intervene, so clearly they didn't care. From then on there was their group of 3, and me. They'd shop together, split bills, and look after one another, while I was left to fend for myself.\n\nI blocked his social media from my account, so he started using hers to leave messages, and even added my ex, to snoop through his life. So, on our return home, I quietly asked his girlfriend to have a word with him about it. \n\nNot start WW3, not dump him; but ask him to stop the behaviour, and just be a decent, respectful human. We were probably never going to be friends, but we would need to be civil if we were going to continue to be around each other. Never did I bait him, or swear at him, even when he was literally yelling in my face.\n\nHer response was: \"He's my boyfriend, and you're *nothing,* why would I do that for you?\"\n\nIt was a huge weight off my shoulders. Finally her words matched their actions. She'd admitted what I'd known our entire friendship.\n\nI left their house that night, and never saw them again. \n\nThey of course told all the mutual friends I was jealous of their house/boyfriends/careers/whatever, and that it was all my fault. \n\nOnly one person ever reached out to ask for my side of the story, acknowledged that the girls in question could be pretty toxic, and definitely self-centred.

Who are you going with?\" questions.\n\nEveryone else I know is either married with kids, or partnered up, and living their lives, so I can't even move in with friends to split costs. None of them are having late nights out either, and it's rare that our interests align, so I end up going to events alone.\n\nWith my parents being seriously unwell, there's no chance of my being able to leave now, even if I could afford it.\n\nNo privacy, no freedom. No space. If I found someone desperate enough to be interested in me, I can't bring them home - even now my parents wouldn't allow anyone to stay in my room.\n\nWho wouldn't consider a 40 year old, with no real dating history, living with their parents, as a giant red flag? \n\nI've learned to accept it. I used to wonder when it would be \"my turn\", but I see now that isn't to be. These things aren't for everyone, and that's ok. \n\nTo be honest, if someone were to be interested in me these days, I wouldn't know what to do.
