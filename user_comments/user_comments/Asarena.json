The first year was okay, but the teacher wasn't very liked. He was a bit mean. We did learn some things though, and I do think he tried his best to teach us. I don't remember exactly what we learned outside of things like days of the week and verb conjugation though.  \nEverything went horribly wrong in the second year though. It started out fine. We picked up from about where the first year ended. Even our teacher this time was really nice. There was just one thing. She was pregnant, and so at some point she went on maternity leave. Who did our school find to replace our teacher? Surely they would find someone just as qualified to teach Spanish? Nope. We were given a substitute teacher who didn't know Spanish. She also happened to be the principal's mother. She would give us worksheets to do and tell us to learn it from the book, but the book was very clearly a book for classroom use. It wasn't meant for self learning. We all genuinely tried at first, but it just became increasingly frustrating as time went on. Our grades became worse and worse, and in the end I think everyone in my class failed the final exam. They then had the audacity to ask us why we did so badly. In the end they finally curved our grades so that we all passed though. I guess they realized how stupid they had been, or maybe some parents had called in to complain. Also, I don't remember this, but my father told me before that the school had tried to find an actual Spanish teacher to be our substitute, but they hadn't been able to. Although, even if that's true, I feel them not being to find one is still kind of their fault to be fair.  \nI had originally planned to take Spanish for four years in high school, but that experience kind of ruined it for me, so I stopped after that year.

I don't study Korean quite as intensely as I did when I first started, but I make sure to do at least a bit of intensive reading every day and watch things that interest me.\n\nRussian- I've been learning Russian for about six months now. Unlike with Korean, I can't really say why I decided to learn Russian, but it just seemed like it would be an interesting language to learn. Either way, I've been having fun learning Russian, so I think it was a good choice in the end!\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe next category would be languages I 100% for sure want to learn. There's only one language in that category for me at the moment, and that language is:\n\nGerman- Similar to Russian, I don't have any true reason for watching to learn German. I just really like the language, and I think I would enjoy learning it. As for when I'm planning to learn it, probably not for a couple of years at least. I want to focus on Korean and Russian for a while.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe last category would be languages I'd like to learn, but I'm not sure if or when I'll get around to them(consider that the answer to your when question for all languages in this category):\n\nMandarin- I like some Chinese singers/groups, and I've enjoyed the Chinese shows I've seen. I also think it would be really fun to learn Chinese characters, and it would be interesting to learn a tonal language.\n\nFrench- No real reason, but it's my first pick when it comes to the Romance languages.\n\nJapanese- For some reason the thought of trying to learn Japanese scares me more than any other language on my list, but at the same time I'm sure I'd have fun knowing Japanese. I feel like I've always liked Japanese media. Even when I was little I already loved Pok\u00e9mon, My Neighbor Totoro, Nintendo games, and so on. If I do learn Japanese then I'll probably try to ladder it from Korean.\n\nThai, Hindi, and Arabic- I'm grouping these three together as my wildcard picks.

I had already been listening to Korean music, watching Korean variety shows, and watching the occasional K-drama for a couple of years before I decided to learn Korean. As for finding content, the first time I learned about Kpop was from seeing some Kpop fans talking about it on a forum I was on. I liked one of the songs, so I checked out other songs by that group, and I soon began listening to songs from other groups and artists as well. I think I found most of them from the recommended videos on YouTube, looking through Kpop playlists, and from checking out songs/groups/artists I saw mentioned by other Kpop fans once I joined a Kpop forum. While watching the variety show appearances of groups I liked, I'd sometimes find myself interested in the show they'd appeared on, which would lead to me watching more episodes of that show. I would also check out shows I saw other people mention, and I looked up lists of Korean variety shows a few times as well. I never got into Kdramas as much, but the few I watched were mostly ones I saw mentioned a lot by other people or on lists of Kdramas.\n\nOnce I started learning Korean, I began looking up playlists of songs on YouTube and such by putting adjectives in front of \ub178\ub798 or \uc74c\uc545 as well as checking the Korean music charts from time to time. I don't keep up with or listen to Kpop as much now, but I do still check out recent releases from time to time. For variety shows, I mostly just watch episodes of shows I've liked for a while now as well as clips from shows on YouTube. I also watch some YouTube and Twitch channels. I found those mostly from recommendations on Reddit posts and from just kind of searching for things myself. One thing I did was search the names of Korean cities in Korean to find vlogs and such of people who visited the city I searched for. I also find and watch/listen to videos of radio broadcasts by searching \"\ub77c\ub514\uc624\" every now and then.\n\nFor books, I mostly just look up recommendations and go from there.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nFor Russian, I've had more difficulty finding songs I like than with Korean. To start with, I looked up playlists of Russian music on YouTube and Spotify, and I found a handful of songs I liked, but I didn't have that much success overall. Checking the Russian charts on Spotify as well as tophit.ru has been a bit more useful, but I'd still like to find more songs. I'll probably try doing more searches in Russian as my vocabulary grows.\n\nWhen it comes to videos, I've mostly been watching content meant for beginner learners, things like Super Easy Russian and videos from the Real Russian Club channel on YouTube. I've also watched a few episodes of \u041e\u043f\u0435\u043b \u0438 \u0420\u0435\u0448\u043a\u0430 (with English subtitles) on YouTube. It's a show I learned about from a YouTube video that recommended shows for Russian learners. I've also seen some other shows that seem interesting recommended by Russian people and Russian learners that I'd like to check out when I get a chance. Some of them do have English subtitles on YouTube, so I could start by watching some of those at least for now.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSo, to summarize, my main methods for finding content I enjoy in the languages I'm learning are: searching things in both English and my target language, looking up lists of recommendations, checking music charts, and paying attention to things other learners mention enjoying.", "created_utc": "1619381947.0", "edited": "False", "id": "gvurl61", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_mxflk5", "parent_id": "t3_mxflk5", "score": "2", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "Asarena", "body": "Anki has probably been the most useful app for me.
