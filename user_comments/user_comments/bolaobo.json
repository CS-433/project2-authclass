The entire south of China formerly consisted of a [Yue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baiyue) people who were wiped out. I'm sure you will call this \"assimilation\" but the Han Chinese were originally confined to a much smaller area and gradually replaced other ethnicities and expanded in territory, which would likely be seen today as similar to what happened to the Native Americans but it occurred a long time ago so what we have is archaeological and anthropological evidence and accounts solely written by the conquerors themselves.
