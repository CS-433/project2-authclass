I actually used to be more advanced in Dutch because I'm Belgian and learned it for 12 years in school, but I studied German in college and although I slacked off a bit too much, my level has definitely shot up far above where my Dutch ever was. I honestly think the two of them help me learn the other mutually.

All three of them are set in the same fictional world and occasionally influence one another with loan words. They are however separate enough not to be influenced by Sprachbund.\n\n1) \u00c0xult\u00e8mu (/\u0251\u02c8xuld\u025bmu/). Spoken by the people of the same name (literally: \"tree soul\"). They are a somewhat spiritual society who live in the jungle, some up in tree houses, some in mud houses on the ground. \u00c0xult\u00e8mu is intended to be a rather implicit language which takes shortcuts whenever it can. Its use of verbs is very sparse, as they are typically skipped when they can be inferred, as are pronouns and most elements which can be left unsaid depending on the sentence. A lot of \u00e0xult\u00e8mu literature is sung in old chants and legends. Its writing system (an abugida) is vertical, bottom to top, as it has been developed over time with religious purposes and the people holds reverence for the trees that protect and surround them and it was first written on tree trunks. It has a system of nine cases and combines with a heavy use of adjective/adverbs (there is no distinction between those two in \u00e0xult\u00e8mu) that often replace verbs. The language is spoken cautiously and they rather well articulated, as they have the reputation of being slow spoken in their occasional contacts with other people. SOV word order, although when the action is suggested by another word rather than a verb, it is frequent for that word to jump towards the end to replace the verb.\n\n2) Turheungka (/'ty\u0280\u0258\u0361\u0361y\u0361\u014bka/)\n\nSpoken by a people of adventurers, river and seafarers who have seen the world around and back again. Very wordy language, perhaps influenced by the fact that the Turheum have a reputation for being loud and boisterous. Turheungka has rather well developed conjugations featuring a perfect/imperfect dichotomy as well as perfective/imperfective. It is a language that enjoys details and lingering on things being exactly precise enough. Has definite and indefinite articles which can never be skipped, and neither can pronouns. Its alphabet is written horizontally from right to left, as left handedness is particularly common among them. They enjoy writing a great deal and all ships also serve the function of sending letters to relatives, friends, or potential business partners. SVO word order, definitely inspired by the likes of German and French.\n\n3) Isl\u00e3nqu (/i\u0283la\u0303\u014bqu/)\n\nMy least developed language so far, spoken by the people of the Vanishing City, a massive capital city which comes and goes across the broad desert it is located in, along the river that cuts it. VSO word order with a focus on verbs and actions. The verbs convey not only levels of evidentially but also hierarchy, which is crucial in their heavily class based society. It is an agglutinative language which is efficient and fast spoken (and aims to be so). The writing system is a mix of logographs and an abjad for grammatical elements or loan words, although it is not typical for everyone to be literate in this society and each scribe puts their own twist on the text they have been tasked to write. \n\nThey're still baby conlangs but spreading myself out allows me to really dabble with a few different linguistic elements I find interesting.", "created_utc": "1660322005.0", "edited": "1660334747.0", "id": "ik0ic1d", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_wml6l1", "parent_id": "t3_wml6l1", "score": "4", "subreddit": "conlangs", "subreddit_id": "t5_2red7"}, {"author": "RobinChirps", "body": "I gotta say that 1) I'm 30 so this was a long time ago 2) our teacher didn't typically make us use textbooks but rather explained us the rules and gave us pages of exercises she'd designed herself, so I unfortunately really couldn't tell you.

Definitely did not like it nearly as much as English but it gave me a nice start before I started learning it in school at 10.\n\nLatin: took 6 years of it through secondary school. best class of my lifez probably because the teacher was extremely competent, patient and kind.\n\nJapanese: had a slightly geeky phase during which I attempted to learn Japanese because the novels of Am\u00e9lie Nothomb inspiree me to but I was too young to really know how to teach myself on my own and I don't really have that same interest for Japanese now to take it up again.\n\nSpanish: I really wanted to take German in high school but could not (lack of students to open the elective) so I took Spanish instead.

Definitely one of the higher up languages on my bucket list.\n\nFinnish: started it on my own once early 2021 and quickly abandoned because of mental health troubles unrelated to the language, then took it up again in 2022 and found the right way of learning.
