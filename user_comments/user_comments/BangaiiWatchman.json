My best advice is to get out.\n\nI don't like saying that. I wish the dating scene was better in my hometown, but it's just not. If you aren't at one of the colleges, hospitals or in high school I can't imagine how you'd meet someone organically.\n\nYou can go to the college bars in Southside Bethlehem and there's lots of cute girls there on a Friday/Saturday night but that's all I can think of.\n\nI live in a big city now and I meet cute girls on almost a daily basis as opposed to the last two years I spent in the LV where I can only think of a handful of times I interacted with a cute girl by coincidence. Being in a bigger, denser, urban city just enables so many interactions that you can\u2019t have in almost all of the Lehigh Valley (the only exception maybe being downtown Bethlehem).\n\nThe LV is a good place to be if you have a young family and want an affordable classic suburban lifestyle.

Which makes sense in the context that God warns man in the scriptures and now he lets us suffer the consequences of our own actions. But again, there are countless forms of evils that we experience where the victims are completely involuntary. For example, it would be a hard case to prove (for me) that a child deserved to be murdered because they ignored god\u2019s warnings about the fall of man in genesis.\n\nTo clarify on non-human suffering: when the problem of evil is discussed there\u2019s an example of a deer that\u2019s been stuck under a fallen tree after a forest fire. The deer suffers for several days under the weight of the tree before slowly dying. Animals in some ways can be considered even more innocent than humans or children and their suffering is a common fixture of nature. \n\nSo the question again arises; why does God let innocent victims, like animals and children, suffer from involuntary forms evils?", "created_utc": "1619096759.0", "edited": "False", "id": "gvfu7fy", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_mvl4wt", "parent_id": "t1_gvf6efx", "score": "1", "subreddit": "IAmA", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qzb6"}, {"author": "BangaiiWatchman", "body": "Interesting.
