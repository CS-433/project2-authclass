We've captured nearly four thousand people, and deported them. The terrorist who's committed the terror attack in France had been captured and deported by us. The terrorist who's committed the terror attack in Belgium airport had been captured and deported to the Netherlands by us. We had captured him, informed the Dutch and Belgian police, then he went to Belgium and bombed the airport in Belgium. There are more than two thousand detainees in Turkey for suspected connections to Daesh.\n\nMore importantly, we're the most effective force against the ideology of Daesh, which is why Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan is a target. What do they do? They convert people from 125 countries by exploiting religion. And we call upon the whole world, saying how they don't have anything to do with Islam and not to join those terrorists. And you, very dishonestly, go around saying we support Daesh. The Russians said the same when our relations were sour. I suggested this to Lavrov in Rome: Sergey, you're my friend, and an experienced minister, give me a single evidence of what you're saying and I'll resign. But if you can't, I'm inviting you to Antalya to enjoy the rest of your life, your holiday. And he answered saying I was a very experienced man and Turkey couldn't find a better minister, and he'd prefer me remaining in my seat. What does that mean? That means they have no evidence at all. So you should be honest.\n\nSecondly, when we listen to you, it's as if you're angels, angels of peace. So I'd like to ask you a question. The UN charter, the CoE charter, every charter you are in, like OSCE, says that you're occupying 20% of the Azerbaijani territory, doesn't it? Was it us who occupied them? Did we occupy Qaraba\u011f? You did. Why don't you withdraw from there? We made suggestions about this too. Told you that we would open our borders with you if you withdrew. You asked why we required such withdrawal, which we replied saying that Azerbaijanis are our brethren, we are one people with two countries, and issues of Azerbaijan are our own.\n\nYou're speaking of honesty. You've been bringing up the so-called Genocide lie every time you can. When we first took power, our president Erdo\u011fan wrote a letter to your head of state at the time. There were two parties on our parliament, the CHP and AK Party. He said, Armenia, you keep bringing up such accusations. Then let's form a joint commision which would be attended by historians of both countries. Open the archives, both countries. As two countries wouldn't be enough, let's invite scientists from Russia, the US, the UK. Let science decide. Whatever they conclude, we pledge to agree to it. What was your answer? No. Why? Because you prefer lies. You have no confidence in your claims. You don't believe in the results of a scientific study, that means you prefer lies.\n\nThe German parliament has made a decision lately, which was followed by a nice statement by the government: Genocide is not a political or generic term, it is a legal term. For an incident to be labeled as such, there should be a legal ruling. Still, we pledge to agree to whatever ruling that commision comes up with, are you in for that? No. Why? You know that isn't true too. So let's be a bit honest. I'm rejecting all of your previous accusations. They're all signs of a typical dishonest attitude. So our policies about all this is clear. In Syria, our soldiers are cleaning up Daesh with local forces. Similarly, on the Iraqi border, our soldiers are waiting. We don't want the support of terror groups such as PKK and Daesh. The PKK militants we have captured or killed include some Armenians too, I want to inform you about that.

The conflict has resulted in deaths of tens of thousands of people. The organization's active branch in Turkey, called [PKK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurdistan_Workers'_Party), is designated as a terrorist organization by the US, NATO, EU and Turkey.\n\nTurkey considers the Syrian wing of the same organization, called [PYD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Union_Party_\\(Syria\\)), and the armed wing of PYD, the [YPG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People%27s_Protection_Units), to be terrorists too, because of their structural links to the PKK through the KCK. The US, however, for tactical reasons, decided to ally with the YPG during the war against ISIS, together creating an organization called [SDF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syrian_Democratic_Forces), which, with heavy training, equipment and air support from the US-led coalition, defeated ISIS.\n\nNeedless to say, Turkey was pissed off for the open support for a decades-long enemy who has caused so much suffering to the Turkish people. Not to mention the fact that that organization has now created a statelet within Syria, creating a huge security risk for future attacks to be mounted from within Syria, right outside the Turkish border.\n\nThe Turkish president, in a call with Trump last weekend, somehow managed to convince Trump to pull back the American troops supporting the SDF, so that Turkey can start a pre-emptive operation that would clear the region from KCK elements. That's why Turkey is invading the territory now.", "created_utc": "1570659943.0", "edited": "1570661151.0", "id": "f34sxyz", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_dfl057", "parent_id": "t3_dfl057", "score": "5", "subreddit": "OutOfTheLoop", "subreddit_id": "t5_2xinb"}, {"author": "anlztrk", "body": "Which has nothing to do with this particular issue.", "created_utc": "1570658019.0", "edited": "False", "id": "f34q20s", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_dfgag3", "parent_id": "t1_f34ptth", "score": "1", "subreddit": "worldnews", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13"}, {"author": "anlztrk", "body": "TAK doesn't exist, and you know that very well.", "created_utc": "1570657420.0", "edited": "False", "id": "f34ou31", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_dfm34p", "parent_id": "t1_f34nbw7", "score": "4", "subreddit": "syriancivilwar", "subreddit_id": "t5_2x5s1"}, {"author": "anlztrk", "body": " You sure?

Azerbaijani sounds very old fashioned to Turkish ears because of the Persian & Arabic vocabulary, while I presume Turkish is littered with many unintelligible neologisms for unaccustomed Azerbaijani ears.\n\nAll these can be overcome with more immersion, which is already happening at least in Azerbaijan with the influence of Turkish media, which is why many Azerbaijanis can understand & speak Turkish better than vice versa. Still, the existence of a [very large number of false friends](https://www.reddit.com/r/languagelearning/comments/bnr9v9/salam_this_weeks_language_of_the_week_azerbaijani/enc34n3/) is cause to much frustration & hilarity for any learner.", "created_utc": "1557760208.0", "edited": "1557821048.0", "id": "enc3ns9", "is_submitter": "True", "link_id": "t3_bnr9v9", "parent_id": "t1_enautjo", "score": "9", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "anlztrk", "body": "While Azerbaijani and Turkish are closely related languages, there is a huge number of false friends.
