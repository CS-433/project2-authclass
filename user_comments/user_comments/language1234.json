The S&P Dow Jones Index began tracking actively managed funds performance compared to various benchmarks a little over a decade ago. And you are right that it is fairly close to 50% beat the SP 500.  Based on their findings after 1yr, roughly 42% of active large cap funds beat the SP500. However after ten years only 17.5% beat the SP500. This gets even worse the longer your timeline. \n\n[SPIVA - Active vs Passive Comparison](https://www.spglobal.com/spdji/en/research-insights/spiva/)", "created_utc": "1638903554.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hnmich1", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_raz0ls", "parent_id": "t1_hnm35cx", "score": "1", "subreddit": "Bogleheads", "subreddit_id": "t5_2shb7"}, {"author": "language1234", "body": "How much could you sell the house for now?", "created_utc": "1638322902.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hmqo8z2", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_r62pdw", "parent_id": "t3_r62pdw", "score": "5", "subreddit": "ChubbyFIRE", "subreddit_id": "t5_wuxe9"}, {"author": "language1234", "body": "I would only recommend hiring one who charges either an hourly rate or a flat rate fee to review your finances and put a simple plan together for you.

Attending college is heavily ingrained in our society.\n\nI willing to bet that traditional colleges will cease to be relevant before long. 30 years ago a college degree had a great ROI. Today going to college for many people results in a negative ROI.  There is an ever increasing number of small colleges that are filing bankruptcy, merging or closing their doors. [https://www.educationdive.com/news/how-many-colleges-and-universities-have-closed-since-2016/539379/](https://www.educationdive.com/news/how-many-colleges-and-universities-have-closed-since-2016/539379/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe value of a college education is a credential that shows the world that you are a capable potential employee. As soon as an alternative,  cheaper, credential is developed the college closure rate will exponentially increase.

Under the \"What he didn't tell me\" section you described policy loans as a way to get cash out of the policy without paying any taxes. If you take out a policy loan, and don't pay it back, the gains are not taxed. Those gains are truly tax free. you still have to pay the 3%(varies based on policy) but there will be no taxes on the gains. So what your guy told you is right. \n\nIt is not a good investment vehicle. You will not get rich off of the returns from a WLI policy. Index funds will crush a WLI return every time. \n\nI have 150k WLI policy that I have had for 10 years. If you subtract the current cash value from the premiums paid over the last twenty years my monthly payment for this WLI policy is ~$14/mo. A comparable 20 year term is also $14/mo. But when the 20 year term is up there is no telling whether or not I will be able to reinsure or what my rates will be. If I get cancer in the next twenty years and beat it I will likely never qualify for reasonably priced term life insurance again. The WLI policy will provide a death benefit even if I live to 95 years old, all for about the same net cost as a term policy. \n\nThose policy loans are an incredible tool to manage your cash flow. If you are a small business owner and have the ability to make one phone call to your insurance company and have them FEDEX you a check for $50k to cover next month's payroll that is huge. Plus you have the flexibility to pay it off in on your terms. You will have a hard time getting a loan with as little hassle and as quickly as a WLI policy loan. I cannot stress enough how big a deal this is if you don't get a steady salary paycheck. Think of it as an emergency fund on steroids that doesn't tie up a ton of cash in 0.002% interest account\n\nIf you want to leave a legacy to your children or your church, or favorite charity WLI is a great way to do that. Like I previously mentioned, as you get older term life will cease to be an option. If you plan on dying after 70 than you are kinda fucked for term. Many WLI policies are structured to pay out until the policy holder is 120 years old, if not longer. \n\nLastly, WLI can be set up with Accelerated Death Benefits/or terminal illness benefits. This is a feature of many policies that allows the policyholder to use the policy death benefit and cash values to cover long term care if the policyholder has suffered permanent disability or is unable to care for themselves. \n\nTLDR: WLI has many very powerful benefits and features that make it way more functional than term life insurance.

If you are already FI or pretty close it probably doesn't make sense to have LI if you are only looking to cover these needs.\n\nThere are plenty of other reasons for LI though that you should consider before just completely writing off having a policy.\n\n-LI can be used to cover buying out a partner in small business situation that could otherwise break up the business. \n\n-You can use a LI policy to preserve your wealth for your heirs. Depending on the size of your estate and local laws you may be subject to significant tax liability that will mean yours heirs will not receive the full amount of your portfolio. The smaller, post tax, portfolio may not be enough to meet your next of kins needs.\n\n-provide long term care for a special needs child.\n\n-you can use the cash value in a whole life policy to provide low interest loans without extensive underwriting to smooth out cash flow disruptions in either a small business or in your retirement. ie if you have 250k in cash values and 1.5mil in stocks it will likely make more sense to borrow some cash from your LI policy to cover your expenses in a down market year than it would to sell your positions. Think 2008 if you sold a sizeable chunk of your portfolio at a 40% loss simply to cover your basic expenses that could destroy your portfolios ability to recoup any losses, permanently lowering your income from your portfolio.
