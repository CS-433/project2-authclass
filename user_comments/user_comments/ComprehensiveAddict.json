However I can still reach my max typing speed with minimal errors & remain comfortable while typing. That said, it's certainly no ThinkPad keyboard. The keyboard on my P50 shits all over the Librem 14.\n\n- The right shift key is only half length. So if you're using this key while typing, then you might need to adjust the positioning of your finger when pressing it. For me this isn't a problem since I type in a somewhat unorthodox fashion & never use the right shift key ever. As a result I remapped the key in the Librem EC firmware. I remapped the Caps Lock to ESC & remapped the Right Shift to Caps Lock.\n\n- The headphone jack still doesn't have automatic switching implemented.\n\n- Updating the EC firmware can be done simply with the Librem EC flash tool in Dom0.\n\n- If you want to use Wi-Fi, you have to enable the hardware kill switch before powering on the device. Otherwise Qubes won't enumerate the PCI device. This also means that the sys-net VM will fail to boot because of missing PCI device if you disable the HKS & reboot the machine. I use a script configured as a systemd service to run before VM bootup which checks for the presence of the Wi-Fi card PCI device & assigns/removes it accordingly.\n\nIf you have any specific questions about it I'll be happy to give my opinion.", "created_utc": "1642539752.0", "edited": "1642550048.0", "id": "ht87vqd", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_s6p464", "parent_id": "t1_ht811jt", "score": "1", "subreddit": "privacy", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhlc"}, {"author": "ComprehensiveAddict", "body": "4 devices consistently in use:\n\n- Laptop: Qubes OS on Librem 14 with Librem Key + PureBoot for Trusted Computing tasks\n\n- Desktop: Manjaro for playing games & for media consumption off local hard drive storage\n\n- Work Laptop: Qubes OS.

This is how I set up my VPN connections on Qubes.\n\n- Create new TemplateVM (debian-11-mullvad)\n\n- Install wireguard-tools (sudo apt install wireguard-tools)\n\n- Shutdown debian-11-mullvad\n\n- Create new AppVM based off debian-11-mullvad (sys-mullvad), set networking to sys-firewall, click provides network, & launch settings after creation.\n\n- In sys-mullvad settings, under Advanced keep the VM as PVH, keep Kernel as default, set Initial memory & Max memory to 400MB\n\n- On the Mullvad VPN website, login using your account number & go to the WireGuard Configuration File Generator (https://mullvad.net/download/wireguard-config/)\n\n- Select the server locations\n\n- Enable VPN kill switch\n\n- Keep port 51820\n\n- Copy the downloaded config files to sys-mullvad\n\n- Extract the downloaded archive to a directory in /rw/config/sys-mullvad\n\n- Edit /rw/config/rc.local as root\n\n- Append the lines:\n\n> sudo cp /rw/config/sys-mullvad/* /etc/wireguard\n\n> sudo systemctl start wg-quick@<your VPN server>\n\n- Replace <your VPN server> with whatever VPN server you wish to connect to. So long as it has an appropriate .conf file. E.g. to connect to mullvad-us123.conf, the full systemctl command would be sudo systemctl start wg-quick@mullvad-us123\n\n- Mark /rw/config/rc.local as executable (sudo chmod +x /rw/config/rc.local)\n\n- Configure sys-firewall to only permit connections to UDP traffic on port 51820\n\nUpon reboot of sys-mullvad, it should now automatically connect to whatever WireGuard VPN server you specified. To confirm, open a terminal in sys-mullvad & type sudo wg. You should see the appropriate tunnel.\n\nTo confirm, set another AppVM to use sys-mullvad for networking.

With that in mind I have got some ideas in response to each power.\n\nData disruption warrant:\n\n- I believe the powers apply to Cloud Storage & Local Storage.\n\n- Cloud Storage you can simply client-side encrypt files & upload to an anonymously purchased Cloud Storage provider. I personally self-host my own NextCloud instance via Tor Hidden Service on a VPS in Iceland. If the location of the Cloud Storage isn't known, then there is no starting point to access that Cloud Storage account.\n\n- For local storage you could prevent visibility by simply hiding an external storage drive really well.\n\n- Alternatively if you wanted to be in compliance & provide decrypted access to a storage device but wanted to prevent any tampering with the contents, you could either use an external drive with a physical hardware write protection switch (prevents the \"adding, modifying, & deletion\" of data portion of the Data disruption warrant) or use a iStorage storage drive with a built-in keypad, but with the drive unlocked in read-only mode. This later is more bullet proof, since a police officer could just flip the former hardware write protected drive from read-only into read-write mode.\n\nNetwork activity warrant:\n\n- This is a fairly broad power definition, so no \"one-size-fits-all.\" Nevertheless...\n\n- Ensure devices use VPN with a client-side & router/firewall-side kill switch to mask all general traffic on your devices.\n\n- Ensure your router is flashed with Open Source firmware like OpenWRT, & uses MAC address whitelisting to whitelist each device allowed to connect to your network, WPA-3 Personal, UPnP disabled, & has password protected admin controls. Typical router configuration best practices.\n\nAccount takeover warrant:\n\n- This is mitigated if you use social media accounts in an anonymous manner, disconnected from your true identify & country of origin.\n\n- Same idea that ties into my previous point about Cloud Storage account: if the accounts & provider you're using cannot be connected to your real-life identity, then there is no starting point to obtain access to the storage.

Once past the initial hurdles, it's very usable. I sure as hell wouldn't go back to a standard distro.\n\nPros:\n\n- Separation of the Network stack & the USB stack into their own virtual machines. So someone plugging a malicious USB stick into my laptop if I'm away from it can only infect the sys-usb VM it's assigned to (not counting VM-escape malware).\n\n- DisposableVMs are my personal favourite & can be used for anything you could think of. Most prominently web browsing. For example I'm signed into Reddit in Tor Browser in a Whonix WS DisposableVM. Once I close this web browser, the VM is deleted.\n\nYou can use a DisposableVM for converting an potentially malicious PDF file into a non-malicious PDF. It starts a new DisposableVM, copies the PDF to that new DisposableVM, flattens it into a set of images, returns them to the original VM, then combines the images into a visually identical PDF file, then the DisposableVM is shutdown & deleted. This matters a lot for PDF files you might receive via email.\n\nSome other use cases I use them for include: signing into my financial accounts account, downloading torrents, & decrypting the VeraCrypt volume on my USB containing my KeePassXC database.\n\nI also use statically named DisposableVMs for sys-net, sys-usb, & sys-firewall. \n\n- Parallel VPNs in their own VMs. Since ProxyVMs can provide network connectivity to other VMs, you can easy run multiple VPN applications simultaneously with different VMs connecting to each. I run two personally. The first connects only to a random VPN server in Australia, which my banking DisposableVM & my general personal accounts VM connects to & another for a random VPN server, for everything else. \n\n- Parallel instances of different pieces of software.

I operate with a fairly high level threat model & have a setup to match. \n\n- How do I pay for streaming services in the most anonymous or private way (which ever is possible)\n\nI can't speak for every single streaming service on the planet, since I just Torrent everything I want to watch. Netflix though allows you to purchase Gift cards from a store. If you go to the store and buy a gift card paying cash, then you can use the gift card to pay for a Netflix account with no financial link back to you. You need to make sure to use a brand new account with a dedicated alias email address. \n\nCircumvention Methods probably won't work with most, if not all, streaming services. But this is a constantly evolving situation. Some servers with some providers will function and allow you to watch unrestricted content. Therefore there's the risk of Netflix tying accounts together by IP address. There's no way around the data collection if you use Netflix (or any other streaming service), hence why I don't use them.\n\n- Is it a bad thing if I transfer accounts from the ones I have existing to the new ones? (For an example, I have music software and in game purchases that I would like to keep but will there be a cost changing the emails on the old account with the new email?)\n\nIt depends. If you update you emails on those various platforms to your new email provider, chances are they'll keep a history of email accounts used on that profile. This matters in the event that those various sites have a Data Breach, Data Leak, etc of they're account information. Therefore in all likely hood your new email and old email would exist in such a database.\n\n- Should I delete all of my old accounts and start fresh? (Is it even possible if I'm using computers that had old accounts with my info, or I guess considering it compromised? I have a laptop I want to use but since my school info and info since before I cared about privacy was on there, I'm still paranoid that I can never use it again)\n\nRealistically with a laptop, doing a factory OS reinstall, preferably moving to Linux, is enough of a clean slate.\n\nA rule of thumb I have is for junk, non-important accounts with no financial information attached, I delete them and start fresh. Accounts that have significance, I change the password to one generated by my password manager and setup the strongest second-factor/2FA I'm allowed.\n\n- Should I compartmentalize shopping and accounts with purchases?\n\nI rarely have a need to purchase items online. Before COVID I had packages shipped to a Virtual Street Address mailbox in an alias name with an alias form of payment.\n\n- What are recommended OS and Distros? ( I thought about having Kali as for my personal and private, Windows for things like editing videos and producing music and a VM for the Social Media Account)\n\nI like Qubes OS. It makes VM compartmentalization super easy, but comes across with some usability issues for non-tech savvy individuals, as well as a literal hardware performance cost and specs requirement.\n\nKali I wouldn't recommend as it's a distribution who's purpose is for penetration testing. So I would recommend looking at Linux Mint Debian Edition: https://www.linuxmint.com/download_lmde.php\n\n- How bad is it for me to put my threat model online? (This isn't that much of a private account)\n\nIn your case I would say no. If your threat model included details about protecting your personal/physical safety, or if otherwise you are a high target individual, then yes it would be best to avoid posting it online.\n\n- Is there any other ways to attempt to do this threat model?\n\nThat's the great thing about Threat Modelling: it gives you questions to ask.

No cost to receive.\n\nGetting a Virtual Mobile Number has a $5 upfront cost, then $5 monthly, plus any SMS messages you send.

Multiple phone numbers can forward to a single email address. But, you can only send SMS messages from a single phone number from a single email address. For example, mobile numbers A & B both forward to email E. You can use email E to send an SMS message from A to mobile number C. But you can't use email E to send an SMS message from B to C.

So even if a network logger existed on my network (which isn't likely), they'd be able to extract zero information outside encrypted WireGuard traffic.
