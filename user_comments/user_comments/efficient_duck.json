My quest to learn Hebrew started about four years ago with my most consistent practice during the Corona pandemic (about 2 online 1:1 lessons per week). I'm now at a low intermediate level, being able to speak well for some topics but still struggling for vocabulary in others. For me, the hardest parts are the following:\n\n* reading without the niqqud is pretty hard. You basically need to know the words in order to be able to read them with a correct pronunciation. This has left me unable to read out loud until way into my intermediate level. Before, I was usually able to identify the shoresh and understand the meaning, but didn't have a sound in my head when seeing that word. This was different for all other languages I interacted with, also Russian and Japanese with their different writing systems, where you start reading right away and can do so with quite consistent pronunciation.\n\n* The machine gun speed people speak in in podcasts, series etc. Hebrew is a very condensed language, with one word containing several bits of information that is usually spread out across several words in the other languages I know. For example, \"I was eaten\" could be one word in Hebrew and you have to think quick to identify the signal for passive, the meaning of the shoresh and the ending that shows it's first person singular. Combine that with the regular Israeli speed of speech and fondness of merging words and dropping syllables and your brain gets a good workout :)\n\n\nBut there also are good and easy things about Hebrew: once you've familiarized yourself with the binyanim, it's pretty logical with not too many exceptions. It's just a lot to learn. I also feel like with my native German and Hebrew I unlocked Yiddish (passive) for free. I actually started reading Harry Potter in Yiddish pretty early on and was kind of fine, with reading that in Hebrew still being a bit unrealistic. Another good thing: Israel is a country that has a lot of support for immigrants wanting to learn the language and that extends to online material and courses. While there's a bit of a lack for intermediate material, the overall resources are great and it gets even better once you are able to interact with original content such as songs as it's just really interesting and cool. Another pro: Israelis (at least those I've met) are super nice, helpful and open which makes speaking the language and practicing fun and easier.", "created_utc": "1663824823.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ipfmrli", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_xkivzj", "parent_id": "t3_xkivzj", "score": "3", "subreddit": "hebrew", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rk3f"}, {"author": "efficient_duck", "body": "One of my favorite childhood recipes involved canned peaches.

I've read your other comments and I'd suggest instead of spending all your energy to fix that space as well as your boyfriend, use it to learn about healthy boundaries for yourself. I can recommend the book \"boundaries\", by Cloud and Townsend, also available as an e-book. It's written from a bit of a Christian perspective which sometimes shines through as that's the author's background but it's not central and the tips are valuable for anyone (I just read it like I'd read something with cultural differences). It has lots of great relatable anecdotes and then tipps to first find out what your personal needs are and then how to communicate them and bring them into action. From reading your posts, I'd say that would be the first step - organizing the space will follow. As it is, it doesn't seem like boundaries have been set up (and the guys have been taking their space) so there is literally no space for you. \n\nI'm worried as you wrote that you want to tread with caution and not upset your boyfriend.

He still wanted to be my friend, though, and has apparently seen something in me that he felt was worthwhile to stay connected with.

Yes, there might be 50 good plastic bags, but I am not the one who produced them all, so I am free to take a few that I might use, like 3, and toss the rest. It's not my job in life to make sure no plastic bag goes unused. They are just tools that should make life easier, not a new to do.\n\nIt made me conscious of how much waste we generate, and made me reduce my tendency of buying and consumerism in general. Sometimes, I cannot avoid ending up with things that could be used - but it is ok if that's not by me! It's likea gift no one asked for - not my responsibility if it turns out to be a burden! And I will either recycle or donate. \n\nIn a sense,freeing stuff allows it to fulfill it's purpose. There will likely never be a 100% usage of everything, but freeing stuff that otherwise would with 100% certainty just sit in my shelf, at least increases the odds of it being used in some way. \n\nAnything is better than stuff being stashed away forever. I regard it as teamwork - I am not the sole person who might get some use out of the things, there are others who might do so! So it's best to donate. And even to recycle - by recycling, you free up some matter that can in turn be used for something else. It's only \"dead\" if it's trapped in your house.\n\nRegarding the nice things, I made it a point to preferably use anything good up *first*. If it's hard for you to enjoy it for yourself, because you don't feel worthy, or like it needed to be saved for a special occasion, maybe it helps if you think that the purpose of this item was to make someone happy, and to create a special occasion *by the use itself*. \n\nAnother thing that I felt made it easier to declutter was to find out more about my personal boundaries and who I am as a person. And to learn to say no. Letting stuff accumulate is often a 'yes' to someone else and a 'no' to your own needs. Realizing boundaries and my needs and wants made it much easier to understand what I would use and what not. It's really a process that goes hand in hand with decluttering.

Learning after a work day is much different than learning at school where your job is to learn.

This means that you will be surrounded (at least online) by people who are reading books or watching movies after a few months of learning. This will likely not happen for Hebrew as its structure and words are just so different. It just takes more time. It is totally doable, just try not to get discouraged by people overtaking you on their way to fluency, in more similar languages.  This will also apply to Arabic, but I think it's harder than Hebrew.\n\nOn the other hand, if your main goal is to read religious texts, there are great courses for biblical Hebrew that focus on the reading skill specifically and that let you progress much faster (but ignore conversational skills as the goal is reading). Most religious texts also include nekudot, indicators of how to pronounce the words correctly, including vowels, which aren't there in regular texts, so the reading progress will be faster in that area.\n\nDespite being only spoken by a comparatively small number of people, there are lots of resources for Hebrew because of the immigration culture. Have a look at the Hebrew subreddit for recommendations on sources. Another point that makes it easier is that it's an incredibly informal language, so there are no specific politeness forms which should be easier for an English speaker as well. I don't think that it would be necessary to learn Latin first as a stepping stone, as the languages are too different from each other anyway. I think an advantage of Hebrew or Arabic would be that you can also try if you like to use the language for communication as well, and enrich your studies with talking sessions and conversations with natives.\n\nMaybe give each language a shot for 1-2 weeks and just see which one speaks to your heart the most.", "created_utc": "1656624693.0", "edited": "False", "id": "iedef5g", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_vobl9m", "parent_id": "t3_vobl9m", "score": "6", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "efficient_duck", "body": "I'm currently doing my first intensive reading with a book in my TL, and I found that writing down the words would be disruptive.

Once you've got the essentials down, make a plan what to furnish when. Distribute it over the next months, and then the individual weeks of each month. It will take time, but it will also give you a sense of accomplishment and down time after you finished your to dos for the week.\n\nFor example, you could assign the month of July to the absolute essentials (bed, washing machine, desk and chair if you work from home, cleaning utensils, everything you need to prepare food). Then do the first week to find a bed, a mattress, pillows and blanket, and two sets of bedsheets.

I have to be honest with you - I, as a woman, would feel uncomfortable if I'm on an empty trail and would encounter a naked man out of the blue. I'm not prude and live in an area where it's totally normal to have nudist beaches, nudist camps and to go to sauna etc naked (Germany), so it's not the nakedness itself. It's the situation of encountering a naked man and having to immediately assess the situation, and classify if it's harmless or a potential threat. \n\nDespite the openness around here, there have been incidents with men flashing, and harassing women, also rapes in the forest, and you just have to be on the lookout. Someone hiking naked is still a rare enough sight that your mind doesn't go \"ah just someone enjoying nature like they want to\", but rather \"ah, might be a nudist..or is he? Does he look like he's about to do something? Is he just minding his own business or acting provocatively?\". It's just part of hiking alone, and as a woman your mind is likely to do that assessment every time you're alone and encounter a lone man, but the latter being naked just adds another layer to it that you have to make a split decision on.\n\nI hope that this could give you a small insight into the mind of someone you could encounter on the way. I'm not against people hiking naked, on the opposite, if it gives you joy, that's awesome and I think it promotes body positivity and is a healthy thing in general. But maybe be aware that you CAN be perceived as a threat (and I fully acknowledge that I wouldn't have these thoughts about a woman, or a group of people). What could be possible solutions? I don't know, because encounters like described can always feel threatening, depending on so many factors, but I think a friendly greeting and \"please don't mind me, I'm just a nudist hiker and don't want to bother anyone\" would put at least me at ease.", "created_utc": "1654231758.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ib03hw0", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_v3ipro", "parent_id": "t3_v3ipro", "score": "14", "subreddit": "hiking", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r9om"}, {"author": "efficient_duck", "body": "You might want to try sleeping on a firm surface to see if your back problems alleviate and then adjust your sleeping arrangement according to your needs.\n\nI had back pain for ages until I started sleeping on a very firm camper air mattress after discovering that it improved my sleep during a camping trip.

I'm also trying to build muscle so I aim to include proteins in every meal. Here is what I eat, maybe something of that can give you inspiration.\n\nMy breakfast: 1 blood orange, 1 banana and about two to three full spoons of skyr or greek Joghurt. I mix in some walnuts and sometimes coconut shavings, put a bit of cinnamon on top, and I'm satiated for some hours and have the two recommended portions of fruit checked off. Oats are also very satiating and have proteins.\n\nMy salads usually are based on baby spinach or similar (everything you can just wash and then it's good to go). I like to prepare some roasted vegetables that I can then add for some days. I just dice sweet potatoes, red beets, zucchini, mushrooms, carrots, mix it with oil and Italian spices or ras el hanout or paprika (red bell peppers?) powder and put it in the oven for 20min at 210\u00b0c. If you don't have time to dice, you can find frozen veggies and just throw them in the oven. \n\nCombine oil, balsamico if you have it to equal parts, mustard and honey or a bit of sugar, and mix it with a generous amount of greek Joghurt or skyr and you'll have a nice dressing that also has some protein. If you swap the mustard for tahin and leave out sugar it's another nice dressing to swap things up a bit.\n\nOther additions to the salad can be diced smoked tofu, pears or apples, goat cheese, pomegranate seeds, just stuff that needs to go, boiled eggs, scrambled eggs, a fried egg on top, canned tuna, chickpeas... You can also just stuff the salad into wraps and that will also change it up a bit. If you have a microwave, add some cheddar to the wraps, warm them up and it feels like a totally different meal! \n\nI also like to add some brown or white rice to the salad and put it for a minute or so into the microwave.

I also do well with just accepting that my language learning comes in bursts of hyperfocussing instead of doing an hour each day.\n\nHowever, it has helped me a lot to reduce the energy needed to start - if I have an appointment with a tutor, I just have to go and show up. No decision on when to start needed. I also made learning as convenient as possible, using my smartphone for vocab and reading. Planning in advance also helps (e.g. putting half an hour of language interaction into your calendar).  I also enjoy reading in my TL very much now as it is such a challenge, so I'm very motivated and look forward to it. If you have something that you usually do, try doing it in your TL. \n\nFor vocab, it helped me a lot to find funny sentences or hints that relate to the words I'm learning. E.g., the infinitive of to explain in my TL is lehasbir. I included the hint of \"explain why lee has beer\" and this just pops into my head and I can access the word easily. The ability to make wild and creative associations is strong in a lot of people with ADHD, so you might be able to use this to your advantage.\n\nAlso, movent - it might be that you learn well while listening during walks. Part of my struggle is that I suffer when sitting down for too long, so I watch series while I'm on my bike (on a stand), I listen to podcasts while walking and so on. Also, set a timer and just do a task for 20mins. This way it doesn't feel endless (overestimating the length and effort of tasks is one of my other weaknesses), and you get a lot done in that time.\n\nLearning by speaking with others also helps a lot, even online. For me, I remember almost everything in social interactions, and that includes language. And take breaks to prevent over stimulation.", "created_utc": "1649398802.0", "edited": "False", "id": "i3v8ubw", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_tyw2a1", "parent_id": "t3_tyw2a1", "score": "12", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "efficient_duck", "body": "I would suggest a different approach to this. I'm living in a city where storage space is rare. So I do not own some things I occasionally need, and am willing to lend some tools I have to others. We all save space that way, and I am happy to be a part of a network of neighbors that I can ask for help. But! I do post my requests (e.g. Asking for a ladder) in a group online, and people can chose to answer and agree, or not. There is no obligation. You might consider such an approach (finding neighborhood groups that share seldomly used items), instead of asking your friends directly. Asking someone directly is putting some pressure on them to agree.  If it really was a one time thing, and you're sure your friend doesn't feel obligation, sure, go ahead (I've also lent my suitcase to a friend a few times, but it's a spare and I usually travel with a large backpack anyway, and I know he has even less space than I do). But for regular borrowings, better find a network of like-minded people, and contribute to it with your own items as well.\n\nI have to add that the delivery of the message also matters. In our WhatsApp group, there is one neighbor who needs a lot, but it is always last minute. I've started to dislike her, as she seems so disorganized and unreliable for that. Should you approach exchanges like that with urgency, it might be a reason that resentment might build up. It's completely different if there's lots of time beforehand and the exchange organized in a way that maximizes the comfort of the giver. It also helps to give everything back in a better state than before, and to give a thank you related to the item itself.\n\nThat said, the approach of borrowing instead of buying is awesome. I think that it is kind of unnatural that everyone has to own everything they could ever need - some things are needed in a community, but not by each individual in my opinion, and it would be better to share. But that needs to be made a decision among a group of friends or neighbors, if it's just one person deciding they borrow everything, it becomes uneven soon.", "created_utc": "1649395644.0", "edited": "False", "id": "i3v44nr", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_tym0fu", "parent_id": "t3_tym0fu", "score": "0", "subreddit": "Frugal", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhbe"}, {"author": "efficient_duck", "body": "I do not necessarily find a lot of German words in Hebrew (with exceptions such as \"Schlafstunde\"), just some words that are adapted to Hebrew from English or Greek/Latin (applikaciah, universitah, biologiah), but for some modern ones of them an \"official\" Hebrew word from the Hebrew language academy exists (but isn't used in daily life, e.g. the word for app is usually written tinily underneath in ads, but the audio has the \"applikaciah\". In general there are not many similarities between German or English and Hebrew. I cannot tell for Russian or Polish, though.\n\nHowever, Yiddish is another story - I'd say I understand about 80-90% of it (still leaving some unrecognizable parts) just by knowing German and having a good base in Hebrew. I tried to read Harry Potter in Yiddish, and while a bit tedious, it is very doable, despite me being not at a level where I could read it in Hebrew.\n\nRegarding the roots, they are central to learning Hebrew. You have to know the root for everything, which is why it is so important to learn Hebrew in Hebrew letters instead of a phonetic transcription. Once you understand the meaning of a root, you can also at least guess all it's derivatives. Working with the roots is so much fun! But I am not sure if the roots of modern Hebrew necessarily translate to ancient Hebrew. I haven't looked into ancient Hebrew at all, but if there are differences, they are not taught in courses on modern Hebrew.

I learned on my own for about one and a half year, then switched to lessons on italki. Not having to motivate myself all on my own for each learning session made SUCH a difference!! It was amazing and almost felt like cheating. I enjoy talking to people, so I knew that there'd always be fun, and I basically just had to show up. That gave me enough initial energy to keep on working on grammar drills etc. I finally reached a level where I could start working with native media, and that in itself is such an enormous motivator for me that I have been keeping on going. Slowly, but steadily. Now it's a part of my life.\nI also met some native speakers and some of them are now close friends, so that also helps a lot. Weirdly, I'd say that living in a big city helped me sticking to it, as there are much more opportunities to use the language. Despite mostly using it online anyway, but the feeling is different compared to where I lived before.\n\nI now regard the brief episodes of language learning before as kind of speed dating languages and especially learning methods that weren't for me. I do feel that the abundance of online learning material and the ability to connect with others by a click or tap has changed the world of language learning completely. I started with audio cassettes and textbooks (e.g. in Spanish) and that was just all I had. The quality was abysmal, and I stopped after a while. It is so different now, connecting to people is so easy, and once you've got friends or at least people to tandem with, it's just persistence that is needed.\n\nI'd also like to point out that my initial learning was based on Duolingo (with notes and writing out the answers).

I do eat fish and I eat most meat when I'm invited and that's what's on the table, but I don't even know when I had my last steak. It is not dogmatic, and it just happened to fall into place like that. If I really crave meat I will eat it, but so far it hasn't happened. The enormous amount of new vegan options everywhere certainly helps and I just like some \"naturally\" vegetarian or vegan dishes a lot, and making them automatically meant one less meal with meat. I feel like every meal switched to a meatless option helps, and reduction is way better than doing nothing about it at all.

Suddenly EVERYONE got married and had kids. I am happy for them, but I admit that I feel kind of left behind and like an alien. It never bothered me much, but this age really is a point in life where you get confronted with being different. Which can also be positive because you get to re-evaluate your own life choices. But one thing sucks, which is the lower financial security and economical power. It is just weird to see others being able to save so much more because they share expenses with their partner. I have worked fulltime for the past six years and let me tell you - taxes take away so much when you are single. I start to understand that marriages were in their origin mostly pragmatic, beneficial to both parties in a sense, and I start to consider marrying someone at some point for the benefits (maybe a QPR partner someday).\n\nI live in Germany where taxes eat up nearly half of your income when you are single (I earn about 4500\u20ac but take home just 2700\u20ac). If you're married, you get benefits (but your partner might be off worse, so it is a double sided sword, actually cementing traditional gender roles). If you have kids, there will be additional benefits and also money that you get from the state for your kids. This is fine, obviously, but I feel like it gets overlooked how much more expensive everything is when you are on your own. I pay my car insurance, I pay my rent, I pay the ridiculous TV tax without even having a set, I have to pay for every little thing that gets broken and needs fixing. I know that people with kids have their specific expenses, too and I wouldn't want to take anything from them, but I feel like singles just live unseen in their struggles, and a bit of recognition would be nice. \n\nI live comfortably on my own, but I do have some dreams that I think I will not be able to fulfill while living alone. For example, I would like to live with cats, but my appartment is too small to host two of them comfortably. Larger appartments are too expensive. I would also like some shared responsibility and not being the sole person looking after them (in case I get sick, have to travel etc). \n\nThese are the downsides. There are a lot of positives, too! I am free from emotional work and emotional exhaustion. I have a lot of time to invest in my friendships, meaning that, apart from the great friendships in and of themselves, I am not totally on my own if I need something. Still, I sometimes wish I had someone to look after me when I am sick, but I work on my friendships so that they eventually reach such a level, and I am totally down to care about my friends that way, too. I also consider living with others in a more communal way at some point in the future,  to enjoy more everyday company and also share expenses, improving on living quality for all.

You do not need to like it, and if this is where your comfort zone ends for whatever reasons, so be it.\n\nIf he \"decided not to\" until you two move in together, that is thoughtful, but ultimately you should be the one who decides what you accept and what not.

Wenn nachts die Zeit kommt wo du gr\u00fcbelst, mach dir und deiner Mutter oder deinem Vater nen Tee und setzt euch zusammen, quatscht \u00fcber alles (un) m\u00f6gliche, spielt was zusammen, egal was, aber verbringt Zeit miteinander und kommuniziert, bis du irgendwann m\u00fcde ins Bett f\u00e4llst und keine Gelegenheit zum Nachdenken mehr hast.

Wichtig ist, dass du vom Gr\u00fcbeln weg kommst, da musst du dein Hirn quasi einmal umprogrammieren. Das Gute daran ist, dass du noch sehr jung bist und dein Hirn sich schnell anpassen wird.

Nooo\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>\u201cLol! Way to take the good with the bad! I never look cute at the end ofa shift. A 24 ounce can of Budweiser usually fixes that though. I maynot look better but everything else looks better to me! lol!\u201d\n\nThis one is in-between. Most of it is normal chitchat, but I'd think it is weird of him to call you cute. If you had installed a very clearly platonic relationship without flirty messages, this wouldn't worry me at all, but in context it doesn't sit too well.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>\u201cI missed you at the reunion. Understood that you couldn\u2019t be there.\u201d\n\nYou specifically, or the two of you (bf and you)? The latter would be nice, the former again ok if none of his other behavior would be creepy.\n\nI think it might be hard to focus on the really inappropriate behavior if there are \"more normal\" messages like the last one in between. Having this mix of normal and weird messages can make one doubt one's interpretation. But independently of what his true intentions are - it makes you feel uncomfortable and you should always react to this feeling. This is an indicator that something is not right and that your boundaries are being overstepped. Even if he just were really awkward, this would be your sign to let him know and to get control over the situations. Your feelings are valid. Overthinking doesn't solve anything, actions do.\n\nMy suggestions would be - write him a message stating that you feel like some of his messages left you uncomfortable because they felt flirty and inappropriate, and ask him to stop. Don't focus on one example or he might try to explain your concerns away, even going the \"ah silly young girl how could I\" route, making YOU feel like being the one with sexualized thoughts. Save screenshots before. If he deflects or gets aggressive, always keep in mind that his actions were the activator for this situation, not how you feel. If it leads to a fight, you are not the reason, he and his actions are - always keep this in mind.\n\nIt might very well be that he tries to diminish and invalidate your feelings - which is common for people who think they can get away with something, and sadly also for those who have inappropriate sexual intentions. Try to stick to how you feel and know that this is valid. Get your bf on board, too. But always watch your boundaries and react to feeling awkward. There should never be a feeling of not being able to adress something with people you consider close.\n\nYou mentioned creepy IRL behavior as well - do you have some examples of that? And nevertheless what they are - again, do not ask us for \"permission\" to regard something as creepy or not, trust your gut ! It seems very clear to me how you perceive all this.", "created_utc": "1631116690.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hc2m1a5", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_pk6lpm", "parent_id": "t3_pk6lpm", "score": "5", "subreddit": "relationships", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qjvn"}, {"author": "efficient_duck", "body": "I second the concern that you are being fetishized.

Like a trophy gf, you seem to be her trophy bf, but based on your racial background which comes in handy to support her role as an activist. \n\nHer requesting racial slurs during sex seems very strange for someone who parades her activism around like she seems to do. She might have some unresolved issues, but no matter where this comes from, it would leave me tense if I were in your place as well. Do you think this is something you can talk about with her? Is she being respectful of your boundaries, and can she understand why this makes you uncomfortable?\n\nOne thing I wondered when reading is if it otherwise feels like a normal relationship to you. Do you feel like your personalities match well, do you have a lot of fun together, do you feel your qualities as a person are seen and cherished by her? \n\nIf you have a stable base, maybe you can talk through this and work on your issues.

I'd echo the users who wrote that first of all, please reach out to him and tell him how much he matters to you, that you know your road has been bumpy, but that you love and accept him for who he is. That you're proud of him, and that while he is gone now, he will always have a space at your home.  This will very likely mean the world to him.

But as I read on, it really seems like she is overwhelmed with coming to terms with his coming out, and therefore trying to somehow erase all the negative memories the past times and conflicts might have brought. It might be worth a shot for her and also for you, to go to some parents counseling on how to accept the LGBTQ+ orientation of your son. It seems like you genuinely love your son and want to have him in your life.

For example, I see a shoresh and it might make sense (to me) that it exists in certain forms, but I cannot know for sure unless I look it up.\n\nThis is especially hard since I'm a native speaker of German - where you can just make up words, as in \"creating new verbs\", as long as it is somewhat understandable. I therefore struggle with grasping that, no, you cannot just create a passive form of a verb when it doesn't exist, even if it would make sense in a specific context. \n\nFor example, in German, you could say \"oh nein, ich habe mein Glas beschokot\" (oh no, I \"chocolated\" my jar) if you had Nutella on your fingers and something got stuck on your jar. It is not an official word, but you could say it and it works and might even be funny to others. I think English is a bit similar in allowing to add the -ing to substantives. Like \"omg I am fangirling so hard!\"). But it seems that it isn't possible in Hebrew to for example just make up a binjan version you'd see as fitting for a shoresh when it doesn't exist.

I used to have just too much of everything. But I also live in a climate with temperatures ranging from -15\u00b0C to -35\u00b0C over the year, so I definitely need weather appropriate versions of socks (underwear is more versatile). I went through it and limited myself to one shoebox full of everyday socks (by \"full\" I mean arranged in one layer with space in between, so I can see each pair, no piles allowed) and one clear box of \\~8-10 pair of fun/cozy/warm socks that I like to wear after showering/before bed. I further focused on having enough light socks and enough dark ones (for sneakers). Now I have about five pair of light sneaker socks, around seven dark sneaker ones and five pair of dark longer socks for boots. I know I need more than the five because I keep on running out in winter, so I will buy some in autumn. I also have five pair of neon sneaker socks for sports. With this selection, I am pretty much covered and I am not overwhelmed because each category has a low number. \n\nAdditionally, I limited myself to one medium sized box of tights (like a coffee table book in measures, just higher). I used to collect them in different patterns etc, but managed to bring this down to the pairs that are actually comfortable, and to a number that is not excessive (e.g. five pairs of thin black tights are enough, don't need twenty). My rule is that they have to fit comfortably inside, in one layer, so I can see all when I look at them.\n\nI have about six pair of good underwear that is comfortable to wear and for now hold on to five more that  aren't as comfortable, but nice. Three \"more special\" pairs for when I'm feeling fancy. I plan to stock up so I have 10-12 pair of really good every day undies. This seems to be a good number for me. I have seven bras, but don't wear all. I started wearing bras that are seamless and like sport bras. Of them I wear four regularly, the others are a tad too large and I want to replace them with fitting ones. I think my good number would be 6-7 pieces.\n\nAnd let me tell you, I ENJOY the open space in my drawers so much.

The houses are usually built to keep the warmth in as colder temperatures were common, which has led to the problem that you basically melt during the heat streaks. \n\nThe first year I experienced such a summer was awful. I just couldn't sleep at all. The next one was better. I had a fan (having the air move feels a million times better) and later an AC. It is so expensive to run it, so I just use it sparsely to cool everything down if I want to sleep and the nights aren't cold enough to bring some relief. I might sleep in the room with the AC then. \n\nWhat helps without an AC:\n\n* create an airflow throughout the rooms you're in (i.e. open doors between opposite rooms and have their windows open)\n* Buy these sunshields you can put onto your car window (the ones with a silver side and a normal one). Put them on the windows that get the most sun.\n* let in fresh cold air at the coldest hours. This is usually at 4-5 a.m.\n* close everything and darken your windows from late morning (9-10 the latest) on\n* hydrate\n* don't drink too cool drinks (with ice), but normal cold, better slightly warmer. If you drink hot drinks you will cool down more, because you sweat (you evaporate less water than you drink)\n* wear clothes that are loose and have breathable material. I find linen to be especially cooling. \n* peppermint oil / lotions can help your head to feel cooler\n* move more slowly when walking (like a chilled out walk instead of trying to hurry from A to B)\n* get outside everyday if there are tolerable temperatures and walk for 30 minutes. This will help you immensely in getting used to the temperatures (works for cold weather as well and you'll need less heating)\n* have many plants for a good room climate. \n\nThis is what I regularly do because I feel comfortable with it. But if I need cooler temperatures (e.g. headache, other ailments), I let the AC run (for me, 25\u00b0C is the lower limit, everything else is too cold).

Now with working from home all the time, I was just so fed up with the state of some areas that I had a few fits of rage cleaning (i.e., pulling everything out, cursing and tossing most of it).

Some things I dread, and I know this stems from negative experiences in my past. For example I am terrified of organizing documents, because the documents we usually got were connected with despair (I grew up poor and there were lots of incidences where money was being claimed back, legal battle ensued, months of limbo...). I still have some documents that are connected to very bad memories, but I only yesterday realized I could digitize some of them and at least toss the ones that I know for sure I won't need anymore.

And you might also find that the moment it involves other people, you just need to show up and go along with it, instead of self-powering through everything.\n\nOnce you have established some kind of routine, the rest of your activities can be planned according to this \"base\" of fixed dates. \n\nFor content, I personally profit the most from anything that I \"experience\" - it is best if some people or social aspects are involved, e.g. talking to a tutor, with friends, being outside in a situation where I apply the language, watching movies where I can see and hear. Anything \"gamified\" or where I can track my data also satisfies this craving for entertainment. I also have a textbook that includes audio and has a wide variety of activities (reading, writing, answering questions etc). I try to stick to the order in this book because the variety will help. Important: STICK with something. From my own experience, 40% of my learning energy in the first two years was allocated to actually learning, 60% was spent trying out new shiny methods, and then at one point refraining from doing so.\n\nI would also like to add that some general tips for language learning might not apply to people with ADHD. For example, it is usually recommended to learn each day in small bouts and not 6-8 hours on a Sunday. This is generally also good for people with ADHD in order not to burn out, BUT if you experience a hyperfokus session, go with it and don't feel bad about it. It is what ADHD brains are really good at, and there is no reason to restrict yourself from it, as long as you enjoy it (and don't completely forget to eat and drink).", "created_utc": "1621586712.0", "edited": "False", "id": "gyx8xvd", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_nhifd3", "parent_id": "t3_nhifd3", "score": "5", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "efficient_duck", "body": "Might it be anxiety?

What I would recommend, though, is to find a valve for that resentment. Resentment builds on swallowing the things you want to say but feel you cannot. You basically have three options (based on your text):\n\n* Work: Find someone to adress the inequality, as others have suggested. This is just unfair and unjust, and even if nothing would change directy, you won't be the person who just swallows it anymore. \n* Family: Adress the issue. Maybe not now, maybe sometime later. But try to figure out what is the underlying cause of your anger specifically for each person, and adress this with them, if that is an option at all. For example, you wrote that the family felt like \\*your\\* family, and now you feel like you are not being seen anymore. Would that fall on open ears? This totally depends on the persons, but sometimes people are so obsessed with something new that they always wanted (and it seems like this is the case for grandkids) and don't realize that they are hurting others by neglecting them, and would be devastated to hear about it. \n* Yourself: If none of that is possible or helps, you can only really work on how you deal with your unfulfilled wants. Can you maybe find this sense of community you wanted from them elsewhere? By redirecting your energy to close friendships and \"family by choice\"?\n\nThe text reads to me that the issue is not them having a kid, but you being and feeling abandoned by the others \\*due\\* to that kid. It might help if you try to not direct your frustration at the kid and at having kids in general, but at the cause of the issue (the abandonment), because you can only  then initiate some measures to change it. You won't change them having a kid, or changing their views on having kids, but there is a chance that you can change their behavior towards \\*you\\*.\n\nIn any way, I hope that you can find a way to redirect your feelings and let go over time. It is really hard, especially when you feel now so deprived of what you thought you found in that family. But it reads unclear if this family really does shun you or if your feelings of hurt (from them and from the past) taint your assessment of the situation a bit.

So I think we need to distinguish between small-ish or unusual languages and languages that you learn because of something that is really private. If you agree with this interpretation of your discomfort, one approach you might like to try is to find out something about the language or the culture that is less private and that you also can get behind, like \"I am interested in learning it because it has been a dead language that has been revived and is now spoken by natives\" or whatever is more neutral to you.\n\nAgain, I think that nearly all questions about why you learn the language are well-intended, but I also tread with caution in regards to my motives for learning Hebrew, because I'm not comfortable with sharing everything with everyone (except with strangers on the internet, heh).

I have no trouble writing an can usually also write words I just heard somewhat correctly.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn addition: I'd say I am at **A0** in Russian and Japanese. I had two years of Japanese at school, can barely read the signs, but remember some grammar rules and vocabulary. I studied Russian with Rosetta stone for a while and can read and write in Russian, know some words and rules, but that's it. It would both just give me a good foundation to start from.", "created_utc": "1618492388.0", "edited": "1618492641.0", "id": "guln6xh", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_mqx72z", "parent_id": "t3_mqx72z", "score": "2", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "efficient_duck", "body": "One additional thing is that I would so not be comfortable with breastfeeding. I mean, pregnancy itself is a gamble, but unless you or the baby have conditions that prevent it, breastfeeding for a few months to years would follow. I have no issues with others breastfeeding and am all for normalizing it, it is just that I feel uncomfortable to the point of nauseous to imagine having to do it myself. All the aspects from my breasts producing milk to having a child latch on, to having your breast act autonomously (i.e. lactating when you head kids crying, lactating when it is feeding time) that send shivers down my spine.

In the two years of self-study I invested so far, I found myself trying out so many things, only to eventually arrive at sticking to one (good!) textbook (with audio) that I complement with a spaced repitition system (discovered Anki recently and am amazed). I then learn the vocab along the way and can be sure not to miss grammar rules. \n\nI also look up each word I want to learn twice - once in an online dictionary and then in the reverso context app. This way I can see the word in context and also hear it pronounced. I then end up entering that sentence into Anki and record it myself, too. But many of the words and verbs are provided by the context of the textbook. I also look up others that interest me, but by sticking to a textbook I do not lose focus.\n\nWhile the approach to just get a ton of input will likely work in the later stages, I found it super helpful to have some kind of guidance at the beginning (aka textbook). I assume that I will be a strong B1 to lower B2 once finished (it has something like 300 pages) and then be ready to just read and watch, with no further grammar input needed.
