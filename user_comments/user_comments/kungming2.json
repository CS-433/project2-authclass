The vast majority of characters have the same pronunciation regardless of where they appear, but there are some notable exceptions (\u9577\uff0c\u884c being especially prominent). \n\n* \u9577\uff0c \"long\" (as in length) is *ch\u00e1ng*\n* \u9577, \"to grow\" is *zh\u01ceng* \n* \u884c, \"to go, carry out smth\" is *x\u00edng*\n* \u884c, \"establishment (business)\" is *h\u00e1ng*\n* \u884c, \"spiritual skill\" is always *h\u00e9ng* (this usage is very very rare, but I knew it growing up cause sutras)\n\nSo for example, \u9280\u884c is always *yinhang*, and never **yinxing*. Another example would be \u89ba, always read as *ju\u00e9* when \"to realize\", but \u7761\u89ba *shuijiao* for \"sleep\". \n\nThere's also a difference between [literary and colloquial readings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literary_and_colloquial_readings_of_Chinese_characters) but you'll likely never really encounter that unless you do Chinese literature. An example would be the poet \u674e\u767d, whose name can be read as *Li Bo* (literary) vs. *Li Bai* (colloquial).", "created_utc": "1652825433.0", "edited": "False", "id": "i902biy", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_urgfne", "parent_id": "t1_i8ztst4", "score": "4", "subreddit": "translator", "subreddit_id": "t5_2ss9z"}, {"author": "kungming2", "body": "Flipped, but Japanese \u201creason for living\u201d. `\u751f\u304d\u7532\u6590` \n\n!id:ja !translated", "created_utc": "1652818588.0", "edited": "False", "id": "i8zm9vw", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_urv5s7", "parent_id": "t3_urv5s7", "score": "6", "subreddit": "translator", "subreddit_id": "t5_2ss9z"}, {"author": "kungming2", "body": "[Check this out](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChineseLanguage/comments/h87vs5/lgbt_terms_in_mandarin_this_weekends_the_shanghai/).", "created_utc": "1652754302.0", "edited": "False", "id": "i8we8nt", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_urb9ra", "parent_id": "t3_urb9ra", "score": "8", "subreddit": "ChineseLanguage", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qyz1"}, {"author": "kungming2", "body": "Hey there u/IntroductionMuted495,  \r\n\r\nYour submission has been removed for the following reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYour post above has been removed by a moderator because:\r\n\r\n* It appears to be unethically sourced.

It is better to treat such cases as these as examples of compounding rather than suffixation, but the use of *z\u01d0* as a diminutive marker begins quite early...\n\n> The use of *z\u01d0* as a suffix to animal names is also ancient: such forms as *m\u0101o-z\u01d0* \u8c93\u5b50 \u2018cat\u2019, *y\u01d0-z\u01d0* \u87fb\u5b50 \u2018an\u0165, *h\u00e9-z\u01d0* \u8c89\u5b50 \u2018raccoon-dog\u2019 can be encountered in Nanbeichao sources.\n\n> In the pre-Tang era, *z\u01d0* as a nominal suffix seems by and large to retain its diminutive meaning and occasionally, by extension, a pejorative sense. By the Tang dynasty, however, *z\u01d0* is found as a suffix to virtually any class of noun, including some that refer to large objects: *ch\u0113-z\u01d0* \u8eca\u5b50 \u2018carriage\u2019, *t\u03afng-z\u01d0* \u4ead\u5b50 \u2018pavilion\u2019, *zh\u00e1iz\u01d0* \u5b85\u5b50 \u2018residence\u2019. Other examples showing the wide range of nouns to which the suffix *z\u01d0* was attached in the Tang dynasty are *qi\u00e8-z\u01d0* \u8304\u5b50 \u2018eggplant\u2019, *\u0103o-z\u01d0* \u8956\u5b50 \u2018jacket\u2019, *w\u014dz\u01d0* \u7327\u5b50 \u2018lapdog\u2019, *y\u00e0n-z\u01d0* \u71d5\u5b50 \u2018swallow\u2019 (the bird), *f\u0113i-z\u01d0* \u5983\u5b50 \u2018concubine\u2019, *l\u00ec-z\u01d0* \u7b20\u5b50 \u2018rainha\u0165.\n\nCharacters added by me.", "created_utc": "1626209646.0", "edited": "False", "id": "h52wb09", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_ojkoyh", "parent_id": "t1_h52782h", "score": "3", "subreddit": "classicalchinese", "subreddit_id": "t5_2v3yt"}, {"author": "kungming2", "body": "Doesn't look like anything to me.
