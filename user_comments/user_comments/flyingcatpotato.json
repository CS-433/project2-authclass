I didn't have to deal with that part because this guy wasn't close to me.  \n\nIn terms of navigating the friend group,  i personally decided for me, without minimizing what he did, that what he had done wasn't egregious enough to make people draw lines in the sand and that i was willing to continue to be part of the same larger friend group with him. So in my case i only told a few people what really went down, not out of shame but more out of not telling people my business, and two of the girls in the core group who were the ringleaders of that social group basically made sure we weren't at the same parties at the same time. another guy in his fraternity would also kind of run interference on football game weekends, like if we were both drinking.  I had one friend in the dorms who didn't drink who acted as backup if the DD flaked or got drunk.\n\nIn terms of navigating him as your bestie, which i didn't have to deal with, i guess what i would have done is a slow fade due to the friend group situation, and just stopped being available at a bestie level and relegating him to member of friend group level and be cordial to his face. If he tries to negotiate or arbitrate the situation, just broken record him- \"you know why we're not close any more.\" When i was in college it was before social media so i didn't have to worry about more than seeing him at a random party or in the library.\n\nFinally, sleeping in his bed, or drinking, or both, isn't an invitation to or excuse for assault.  Specifically, just because i mentioned all these contingency things above doesn't minimize assault- i'm just saying this is what i did at the price of preserving my friend group. I think you need to hold space for yourself in terms of not feeing ok with what he did, and also separate that out from what you want to do in terms of navigating your social relationships.

That said, even though i walked fine, i was slower at a higher weight and i always added five minutes to whatever time an app told me i needed to walk somewhere.\n\nI was and am a swamp beast so i couldn't wear dresses or shorts and walk long distances at that weight due to thigh rub, so if you get thigh rub i would suggest jeans or good pants on walking days. But the fall isn't shorts weather in europe anyway. \n\nAnother point re clothes: at 240-260 i was anywhere from a US 18 to 22 and couldn't easily find clothes in Italy/France- France's 48 (biggest rack size) is a 16 and for women, i can't find my bra size off the rack anywhere but the UK. Travelling bigger means not being able to wing it like some people in terms of just buying stuff if they need it. Make sure you have a full change of clothes in your carry on unless your first stop is the UK.\n\nMake sure your shoes and socks are broken in and sturdy and supportive- even though i've lost some weight, I wear hard cross training sneakers and structured sports socks when i am travelling, because gravity is what it is, and even at my current weight (180 ish) my feet swell in bad or loose shoes. Don't wear flats or flip flops or other types of shoes that don't support, be super intentional about your footwear to help your legs carry you. Flats and walking are a recipe for a cankles disaster for me.\n\ntl;dr I not just travelled but lived in a bunch of european cities at your height and weight, it's fine, bring good shoes and have fun, if you need to clothes shop do it in the UK", "created_utc": "1627548783.0", "edited": "False", "id": "h6xoj2z", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_otd9xq", "parent_id": "t3_otd9xq", "score": "13", "subreddit": "solotravel", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rxxm"}, {"author": "flyingcatpotato", "body": "i'm still not a good sleeper and never will be (thanks DV) but three things help:\n\n* melatonin, it makes me sleepy enough to outsmart my anxiety lizard brain\n* stopping screens an hour before bed, and bed is only for sleeping. \n* mouthguard. it helps me not grind but it also it is a ritual, mouthguard time is sleep time", "created_utc": "1627538820.0", "edited": "False", "id": "h6xcp2b", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_otp488", "parent_id": "t3_otp488", "score": "1", "subreddit": "AskWomen", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rxrw"}, {"author": "flyingcatpotato", "body": "i got picked on too so i too sing alone alone (i even wait for my neighbors to go on vacay)", "created_utc": "1627538716.0", "edited": "False", "id": "h6xck63", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_otn3ad", "parent_id": "t1_h6whu8v", "score": "6", "subreddit": "AskWomen", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rxrw"}, {"author": "flyingcatpotato", "body": "the abortion pill would be OTC", "created_utc": "1627538665.0", "edited": "False", "id": "h6xcht4", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_otoyul", "parent_id": "t3_otoyul", "score": "35", "subreddit": "AskWomen", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rxrw"}, {"author": "flyingcatpotato", "body": "i break things down in to the smallest tasks possible because a lot of my anxiety comes from me being anxious about the stuff i am not doing or need to do and wanting perfection but already being behind and I just spiral.  to give an example, i have a language exam i am studying for but i'm also going THROUGH IT because i quit my job and i have mixed feels about it so i've been crying for three days. \n\n But i have to study for this exam because it is expensive and in six weeks.

Does she have these expectations of herself ? Because makeup does take up space, as do nice shoes, and so on. My ex husband wanted me to pack light but also wanted me to be perfectly made up, shaved, fresh outfit, nice shoes...not calling you out, just saying that this could be part of the answer for overpacking and the beginning of a discussion on how to downsize.  I have a friend who doesn't like to wear sneakers and always takes three or four pairs of nice  shoes on a weekend trip because that's her personal style and we can't talk her out of it. She can't onebag and feel good about how she presents at the same time, but we have been able to get her down to a rollerbag on some trips. She brought heels  for a ski weekend because she equates running around in moonboots as not looking polished and then she doesn't feel good.  \n* Are you both clear about what activities will be planned and what the dress code is?  Because a lot of overpacking beyond personal style is packing for what if. Specifically, sometimes there are situations where a man can get away with going out jeans and a crisp shirt where a woman might need to be more dressed up, and that's a separate outfit too.  There are things certain men can wing with their clothes and the same pair of shoes that require a bit more planning for some women (I'm generalizing here, it's reddit and i've already typed a novel here). For example, i have big thighs, so throwing a dress in my bag for a dinner out at a michelin restaurant isn't just a dress- it's a bra that looks good under it, biker shorts for my thighs, maybe some ballerina flats, all of which i will only wear for that dinner, and what makes me personally feel good dressed up, which may be more clothes than another woman.  What stopped me from onebagging on a cruise was my formal dress and the crap like nicer makeup that goes along with it for me to feel and look dressed up whereas my guy friend just packed a blazer and ironed his khakis and wore leather sneakers. Also, i tend to dress up more in Paris and buy more, so packing for Paris is hard and it requires more planning.\n\nLike in all relationships, a calm discussion could help see where a compromise could be had, as could being organized about what activities you need to pack clothing for as part of trip planning. Like, could you have your personal item backpack and she have one of those 40-45L max carryons plus a personal item? How much can she pack and still feel like she has options and still feel like she is presenting herself in the way she likes?

Trust your process and don't let family or friends rush you or force you unless your life is actively at that moment in danger.\n\n**What i would have done differently**: the jurisdiction in which we lived at the time has laws around finances and separation, and i would have filed for legal separation sooner, including the financial part because i got screwed in my divorced for money (i don't want to go into details, not many people live in that country).

Again, my details aren't important, the takeaway is: be straight on the finances before you walk even if it's hypothetical.  Lawyer up early, it winds up being cheaper in the long run if stuff is stopped before it becomes and issue. If you have kids really lawyer up early. \n\n**What i did:** Changed my email  and social media passwords. Got a burner phone number and moved stuff over gradually.

So someone on the lower end of the pay scale who consistently buys brand new  expensive vehicles and a new maxxed out iphone every year- that's not cool if i have to pitch in to pay or go without so they can have those things.  My current phone is a three year old mid market android, and the keyboard sucks but like...a new phone isn't a financial priority for me right now.", "created_utc": "1611906127.0", "edited": "False", "id": "gl7ka56", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_l7hn53", "parent_id": "t3_l7hn53", "score": "1", "subreddit": "AskWomen", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rxrw"}, {"author": "flyingcatpotato", "body": "while i much prefer hairy bear types, i can be attracted enough to a guy who is naturally not super hairy if it is their natural state. a guy who intentionally grooms himself to mole rat is a definite no.", "created_utc": "1611840983.0", "edited": "False", "id": "gl33861", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_l6w7c7", "parent_id": "t1_gl304bc", "score": "4", "subreddit": "AskWomen", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rxrw"}, {"author": "flyingcatpotato", "body": "another vote for shemagh type scarf (i use a hirbawi) water bottle, tp and pen and notepad.  when i get cold my neck tends to get cold the most, and the scarf helps with that because of the blend.

I will say i got the C2 despite having an obvious accent, and that's because i had the goods and put in the time. \n\nFWIW i did the classic summer immersion in Quebec  when i was about a B1. After immersion i lived in France i estimate it took me around ten years of living in various french-speaking environments to get to C2 and get to the point where i never miss jokes, etc. I'm an avid reader and i basically only read novels in French, i watch the news in french, etc etc. I have a lot of friends from the paris suburbs and most of my slang is from them. Even some of my colleagues who are native speakers are impressed with the paris slang i know despite not living in Paris. But that wasn't me picking up a book on How to Speak Verlan in 90 Days it was just time and friends and curiosity and knowing enough French to know who does what where.\n\n Now maybe you're smarter than me and it would take a shorter time idk- i just think a lot of what you are looking for is not possible without a lot of cultural immersion, a genuine curiosity for many different aspects francophone cultures- and then it takes the time it takes because there is a lot to learn.  I do think this could have been done without living in immersion but it would take a lot of cultural immersion in media like books and podcasts and tv shows and so on AND spending time with native speakers, even virtually.  So you need to keep your tutor and immerse yourself, even virtually.  \n\nAlso you don't need to move to just France. Belgium, Switzerland, Quebec...are also options.
