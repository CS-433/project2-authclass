So let's say you're going to start kindergarten in fall of 2023 (the start date differs, typically schools farther south where it's warmer start in August, whereas the generic school start time is September like in popular media, even though that's mostly a northern state cold weather thing). That kindergarten class would be composed of everyone who was born from December 1st 2017 to December 1st 2018. This means that some kids start kindergarten when they're 4 instead of 5, as in all the kids with september through november birthdays. This also means that the oldest kids will turn 6 in December, and everyone will follow from there. Now in my school district, this date was more of a guideline than a strict rule. Parents typically have the discretion to choose if they want the kid to start later by a year. As in, for the scenario I've created, some parents of kids born in November 2018 don't want their kid to be the youngest in the class (in case they lag behind the older kids in social and educational skills). So they might choose to not enter the kid into school until 2024, making them one of the oldest kids in their grade. I knew someone in my class who waited a year before going into kindergarten, and another kid who did kindergarten twice. So both of them were technically supposed to be in the grade above me. I also knew ppl in the grade below me who technically should've been in my grade. So the cutoff wasn't set in stone. But typically it's only kids born about a month before the cutoff date that get delayed a year.\n\nIt also didn't occur to me that Dec 1st was a weird cutoff date until i got into college. I knew someone who's cutoff date was in June, like at the end of the school year. And some other ppl said their cutoff date was like around the first day of school. Both of which make a lot more sense haha. I wonder if where else has weird cutoff dates.\n\nSo depending where you live and where you were born, you might start school at 4 and graduate at 17, start at 5 and graduate at 17 (if you have a birthday in the summer), or start at 5 and graduate at 18.

Also i think people perceive \"I would like\" as being a more formal/fancier phrasing, and so more polite.\n\nAnd like the other person said, it's giving you a chance to reject the apology, and a chance to reject it before they actually give it.

How their parents came to that idk but like, do not feel obligated to form a full name from the nickname. Think about some very classic nicknames, like Skip and Buddy. Rarely do those nicknames correlate to any element of a person's legal name. Something like Rosie is easily a name you could say \"oh it's just a thing my parents like to call me\", it's very in a pet name realm. Think of Miley Cyrus and Dove Cameron (depending how old you are you may need to look one or both of them up haha).

The person who I was looking at, her mother was written with the wrong last name in this book (which was understandable to be fair once I became pretty sure she was adopted), and her father supposedly had a second wife, but I literally found no record on ancestry of a person with her name at a reasonable time or place. Luckily the person who provided the family history for that section had a website and an email address. I asked her what her thoughts were and she said she no longer had the information and if I couldn't find any supporting documents i was safe to assume it was incorrect. So this was wrong information about someone from about 200 years ago that was in an official book about the descendants/relatives of a US President!

Familysearch profiles can be edited by anyone (which has its plusses and minuses, but at the end of the day I prefer this feature), and it's meant to just be one profile for each person. As in unlike ancestry where 100 users might have the same family members as part of their tree, so its just all repeated information, on familysearch each ancestor should only exist once. And it's free to make an account.\n\nIf you decide to check familysearch, go to search and click family tree (or family tree and then click find), and search for the ancestors. You want to be as sure as possible that there isn't already a tree for people before you make a profile. A lot of times, people will copy over a tree from ancestry to familysearch (With no sources which drives me crazy!), so if your family is already on ancestry, chances are that it was copied over to familysearch. Also very good to keep in mind is that there is a group called the US 1910 Project or something like that, basically it just means that if your ancestor was in the 1910 census they have a profile made for them, which might have the poorly transcribed name from the 1910 census and not their actual name. Also sometimes searching for profiles that already exist is hard to do, I often have more success looking for the sources that would be for the person, and checking that no one in their household already has a profile. Only then would I probably make a profile.\n\nBut as far as adding to your cousin's tree, I don't see how you would do that without contacting your cousin.

Jacqueline and Faye are interesting enough although not as unique as Arzella that it could be ok, but Michael is so ordinary. Having a girl with an unusual name and a boy with a common one always rubs me a weird way, like the person naming thinks of girls as cute little dolls that it's fun to dress up and give fun names, but sees boys as like, people who should get 'normal' names. Same with the idea of giving all the girls the same middle name but the boy gets his own. Again it feels like you're setting up the boy to be the 'special', 'important' one, whereas the girls would all be part of a matched set. I guess it just has some air of heteronormativity and sexism that's hard to explain well. People certainly do it but I can't recommend it. And I do think on average people would be a little judgmental of siblings with one kid with a \"normal\" name and one with a \"weird\" name.

It's just a term that is really associated with \"othering\" the ppl you're talking to, and \"othering\" is inherently associated with thinking less or poorly of them. Because it means the person talking don't belong to that group or do those actions, so they must be better than this other group.\n\nSo yes, the sense from someone saying \"you people\" is that they're trying to be \"polite\" and avoid saying a more pejorative or outwardly offensive statement, even though that's what they are actually thinking. And it can be about any \"group\", not just a racial group.\n\nIt *can* be said in a nice way, but that's pretty much impossible to pull off on the internet since you can't include tone. It can also be said in a more joking way as a lower level insult. Like if my siblings scared me as I was walking by them, I could say \"You people will be the death of me\" by which I'm being overly serious as a joke. But again, it is nearly impossible to pull off on the internet. \n\nNow, \"you guys\" and \"y'all\" can be used in this way too, but it's not the main way they're used, so it wouldn't be assumed to be meant offensively unless there was more context that would suggest otherwise.", "created_utc": "1658038295.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ighltrt", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_w0zx8e", "parent_id": "t3_w0zx8e", "score": "10", "subreddit": "EnglishLearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2u8ap"}, {"author": "Skystorm14113", "body": "It's all about smiling!

You're definitely not eternally screwed. I failed a class I really enjoyed at the end of my fourth year which is basically why I had to take an extra semester. I convinced the teacher to let me take it as an independent study in the fall and it was honestly one of the best learning experiences I've ever had because I made sure to meet with my professor one a week to go over what I learned, so I actually understood the material. And now he writes me recommendations! And I just got a job recently actually in my field (although not the topic of that specific class). Also I graduated with like a 2.9. So it is absolutely not the end of the world to fail a class. I know someone that wanted to get into vet school and failed Physics twice before finally getting a C, and she didn't get into any vet schools out of graduation, but after two years of working she did finally get accepted into one! Your classes are supposed to be for *you*. This is a product you're paying for, it is not about winning some competition. You need to figure out how to get what *you* want out of *your* education. That's what matters. You cannot let yourself be preoccupied and anxious about perfection. That will only make you more discouraged from trying. Review what you did last year and figure out what you need to do this year instead. Do you need to take notes a different way, do you need to create a weekly schedule for yourself, do you need a study buddy to meet with? Always make sure you make time to go to office hours. That was one of the biggest mistakes I made freshman year. By sophomore year I spent most of my time during the day in office hours. Go to the Learning Strategies Center's website and look around, read the resources and contact them even for help. Make a plan for this semester. Don't just tell yourself it'll be better because you want it to be. It's really easy to fall into old habits. And seriously, take a light courseload, and take note over the year what causes stress points for you and learn from it for the next semester. If you get fin aid, you can still get fin aid for a 5th year of school. LSC also provides scholarships to take summer or winter classes if you need to and get fin aid.

I get the sense that in the past a middle name in American culture was just like a bonus name. Not very special, not worth thinking much about. Some cultures or families would use it to reference back to important family members. My great grandma's middle name was the last name of her mom's best friend (and in her culture, it seemed like in general people's middle names were last names from the family). \n\nBut I think that people have gotten more and more into the idea of aesthetics and how that ties into a middle name. Like honestly, I don't think nearly as many people cared if the middle name \"flowed\" before social media where now you need to post the name to all your friends and family and followers and it needs to sound good. Like to me it's related a bit to the need to be a brand. It's not really about not being a duplicate for official records purposes. If that was the case everyone would be making up their own name. That's why we have different official ID elements like Social Security and Date of Birth.\n\nCertainly true that in my day to day life, middle names only matter if you're monogramming something or as a fun fact about a friend. It really doesn't mean much. Me and my siblings' middle names are all my mom's last name which I always liked, I was very surprised to learn that other people had first names as their middle names! But my middle name has little to no impact on anything. If I didn't have one it would just be a different fun fact. I don't know the middle names of most of my friends.\n\nI think people do focus too much on the \"flow\" of a first and middle. I agree it's fun to think about, but I definitely believe it doesn't actually matter at all, because you'll pretty much never be called by your full name. I think people should feel more ok with just choosing two names they like for whatever reason and who cares if it sounds \"good\"", "created_utc": "1657836406.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ig6q63n", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_vz0oil", "parent_id": "t3_vz0oil", "score": "2", "subreddit": "namenerds", "subreddit_id": "t5_2xmrc"}, {"author": "Skystorm14113", "body": "The thing is, we do use it in English, we just don't have a unique conjugation to indicate that we're speaking in a different mood.", "created_utc": "1657835609.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ig6o83l", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_vz2sr3", "parent_id": "t3_vz2sr3", "score": "4", "subreddit": "learnspanish", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rd6d"}, {"author": "Skystorm14113", "body": "Yes yes yes yes yes yes\n\nI have been saying so much recently how sad it is that Pokemon has dropped the ball on side series games.

Many people don't know many of their ancestors' names. Many people were adopted and never learned their birth parents' names. Many people may just be from areas of the world that don't traditionally do a lot of written records. This is all ok. None of it is absolutely necessary to know who *you* are. You are probably feeling untethered and maybe without a real home or community, and you're turning to genealogy to find it (this is my armchair therapist mode). Totally fine, but you can also find solutions in other ways. I think personally that you should consider seeing a therapist or trying to get involved in your community in some small way if you feel really disconnected. And give yourself time to embrace and relish in your Netherlandish culture. Maybe engage in media in the language or practice speaking it with your kids. And it sounds like you'd really like to go back and visit your family some time. I would start putting aside money for a trip to go back, it sounds like it's really important to you, and I think it would be a great experience for you and your kids.\n\nNow for the genealogy part, you can start simply so it isn't too overwhelming. Schedule yourself a time to start by writing everything you know down. Start with yourself, your full name, date of birth, place of birth, place you grew up, what school you went to, maybe some other dates and details. Then do your parents. Just do as many relatives as you can. If you can only remember a vague person, like a \"Cousin John\" who you recall meeting once, write down that name, and where it was you met him, and about how old he was, and what your understanding is if any of his connection to the family. I think you'll be surprised by how much you know! Continue to note stuff and write it down over time as you think of it. Then, schedule a time to talk to your family about this stuff. Explicitly schedule a time for this reason so you don't chicken out or forget to ask. You might have to do this stage piece by piece. Start by asking your parents (if they're alive) about their siblings, their parents, and their grandparents. Get dates and details of the same kind. Write down anything they say. Let people's minds wander to wherever they naturally go instead of trying to force stories. Then next time, maybe you ask about the grandparents' siblings, and ask who would know who their parents are. So on and so forth. Maybe nobody has written out a family tree yet for your immediate family. That means you'll be doing important work! And anything you write down will be better than nothing. So don't despair.

I had an acquaintance named Leila and I constantly forgot if it was Lee or Lay. I think a lot of people would ask which pronunciation it is because it's fairly well known as having two common options. And of course, this is only a problem when reading it from writing. Spoken it won't make a difference. \n\nAnd also also, truly, it is the American way to have a name that isn't spelled or pronounced right. Even if your first name is 'normal', the odds of your last name also being so are near impossible. \n\nIn America, there are two major roadblocks to pronouncing/spelling a name 'correctly'. One, English is a bad language for getting pronunciation from spelling. There's tons of common names that have totally unintuitive spelling. Take Michael for example. We only say/spell it right because it's one of the most popular boys' names in the past 100 years. But if you had never seen that name before, you'd have no idea how to spell it from hearing it. Even if you were like, an English professor with a PhD, if you'd somehow never come across the name there's no reason you would spell it like that. Two, America has names from 100s of languages and cultures. Even if English was more like German or Spanish in consistent pronunciation from spelling, it still wouldn't necessarily help when being exposed to what are essentially new words from new languages. Michael is also a great example. It's a several hundred year old transliteration of a Hebrew name. Leila is also a great example. It's an alternate spelling of a transliteration of a Persian spelling of an Arabic name that was introduced to the English world through poems in the early 1800s. So it would be hard to fault anyone for not pronouncing it \"correctly\"! \n\nAltogether, my point is, almost no one in America doesn't have to spell their name or correct pronunciation at one end or the other. My first name was a top 20 name for my year of birth, but it has a common alternate spelling. Just last week my doctor spelled it the wrong way! And last year, I had two different American people read my name off of my Zoom profile and pronounce it incorrectly in the same week! Then my middle name which is my mother's maiden name, is a correctly spelled Slavic name but we pronounce it in a \"Americanized\" way. Am I pronouncing my own name wrong? By some measurements yes, by others no! But it also means there's no way for anyone to read it and pronounce it correctly. It has letter combos that English doesn't have, so there's no way an English speaking person would pronounce it correctly when reading it. But technically a Polish speaking person wouldn't pronounce it \"correctly\", as in the way my family says it, either. And my last name is an Anglicization of a *different* last name that looks similar to our original one. It also has a capital letter in it, and you better believe that capital letter never gets included on any autogenerated forms. And sometimes people spell it as two words instead of one, or occasionally mispronounce it. I am really not even close to the worst example of this kind of thing.\n\nSo forget being worried about \"correcting\" Americans. Names and words are all variable and language is a naturally evolving and changing thing. Try not to think of a pronunciation as \"right\" or \"wrong\". Just that there are different options and you'll ask people to use the one you prefer. But understanding that this happens to everyone and is impossible to avoid even with a common 'American' name hopefully makes you able to have a more zen approach to it", "created_utc": "1657744074.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ig1e171", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_vy38r7", "parent_id": "t3_vy38r7", "score": "3", "subreddit": "namenerds", "subreddit_id": "t5_2xmrc"}, {"author": "Skystorm14113", "body": "People are generally anti \"unique\" spellings in this sub, so you're not necessarily going to get a good evaluation of it.

This is not a solvable problem through spelling. English has no way to indicate what stress is on what syllable. This causes problems for English speakers in English! I can't tell you how many times I've learned a new word and put the stress on the wrong place. Homogeneous, posthumous, tutorial, and Arabic are just the words that come to mind as having caused me problems. I have had to actively remember the stress on those words.\n\nSecond, to be clear, even English speakers mispronounce or misspell relatively common English names. Some names have several valid pronunciations and spellings. My name has a common alternate spelling. My American doctor that I just saw last week spelled it wrong! And it was like a top 20 name for my year of birth. People don't even ask sometimes, they just spell it wrong! Nobody means anything mean by it, it just so happens that in the English speaking world, we have names from so many different cultures and languages, many with unintuitive pronunciation and spelling that we only remember because of tradition, and people go by the version that's familiar to them. Take Michael for example. None of its spelling correlates to its pronunciation. Mikel would probably be closest. But you're expected to say it and spell it right, and most people do, because we're all used to it, despite the fact that it's a Hebrew name transliterated to English probably like hundreds of years ago.\n\nThird, this does not mean your name will never be pronounced right. You are lucky in that a) your name is Spanish, which means many people in the US are familiar with the sounds of that language, b) it is a very short name, and c) it is near identical to a name Americans are already familiar with, that being Herman.\n\nSo what you want to do comes down to how much you care about it. If you're ok with telling people your name is Herman, with accent on the first syllable, then go with that. There's nothing wrong with it. It really is very close. If you would like to try and get people to pronounce your name correctly, it isn't that hard, you'll just have to say \"Hi my name is Germ\u00e1n. Like Herman but with the accent on the second syllable.\" You could also wait to say the second part after you hear them try to say your name, but some people like to just head off the problem at the pass.\n\nNow the problems you will run into, is that without meaning to, people's brains will autocorrect what they hear to a more familiar version. Which means you might say all that and people will still say your name wrong because they can't quite register what you're saying. This is not intentional, and as long as they're not mean about it, there's no need to take offense. People really can't help doing this. A lot of people won't quite get what you're saying, and will just avoid saying your name out of total embarrassment. This is important to note: This might be from how you pronounce the R in the name. If you say your name Germ\u00e1n with a typical Spanish R, the average English speaker will have a harder time getting what you mean, because that's not a sound they're used to, and their brains don't know how to translate that back to a letter they're familiar with, nor are people typically willing to try and say a sound they don't use in their own life. For the biggest rate of success, you should pronounce your name with an American R but with the stress on the last syllable. \n\nI, for example, knew someone named Mart\u00edn. Now I speak Spanish pretty well, I've been to Spain and Ecuador, I've spent like 8 years learning it. But I still never say his name with a Spanish R, even though I did put the stress on the second syllable. It is too unnatural for me and I would've genuinely felt silly and embarrassed to pronounce it that way. It would've felt like I was trying too hard, because it's generally embarrassing in America if you are a native English-speaking American but you try to put on an accent. Even friends I had that spoke Spanish natively I don't think said his name with a Spanish R.\n\n**So tl;dr, I think you should be pretty good if you say \"Hi my name is Germ\u00e1n\" if you say it with an English R and the right stress, and have patience with people.**\n\nBut  I guess your main problem was that you don't want people to link your name to Germany. Well if you're just saying it out loud, I don't think the average English speaker will realize you are spelling it with a G. So there's really no problem there. But if you have to write your name down, yes people will see it is spelled like Germany. I don't think it's that big of a deal. I doubt anyone will find it weird. Depends where exactly you are, like in a multicultural college, everyone will be used to seeing names they're not familiar with, and they won't judge you for it. At worst someone will be like \"Your name is German??\" and you'll say \"Actually it's Germ\u00e1n with an H sound and the accent on the second syllable. It comes from the same word as Hermano meaning brother\". And that should be that. If someone actually makes fun of you for it, cross that bridge when you get there.\n\nAnd I also recommend introducing yourself several times over to the same people if you don't think they remember or are comfortable saying your name. I recommend ppl do this no matter what your name is. The worst impediment to making connections is for someone to not feel comfortable using your name. The first couple times you see someone, say \"Hey it's Germ\u00e1n, we met earlier?\" and stuff like that. The more they hear your name, the more they'll remember it and be comfortable using it.\n\nI'm sorry this was a lot haha but I hope it helps.", "created_utc": "1657646133.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ifvpcl9", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_vx6due", "parent_id": "t3_vx6due", "score": "2", "subreddit": "EnglishLearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2u8ap"}, {"author": "Skystorm14113", "body": "You can say that, but it's more natural to do it the other way.

As in, almost all languages are spoken before they are written, and written language is just an attempt to try to represent spoken language, but written language lacks any tone or pacing, so we use things like commas and semicolons and colons and periods and exclamation points and parenthesis and em dashes and question marks to try and convey the tone and pacing that we would be including in a normal spoken sentence. Now because selling grammar books was very profitable/fashionable, there are \"rules\" established for when to use all these symbols that many people are taught in school, so even though you can argue there's no \"right\" way to use any of these symbols, there's certainly some ways that most people would consider wrong and some people would consider right.\n\nI say, the best general rule to go by is to use a comma when you would pause slightly while speaking. Everywhere I have used a comma thus far in this post, if I was reading the post out loud I would make a slight pause. If you don't use commas in a long sentence, it will imply that you're speaking in a continuous monotone stream of words with no pause, which would obviously sound unnatural. As a corollary to this main rule, commas are also used to list things, as in \"Can you pick me up some eggs, bread, and milk?\". Commas are also used to separate a clause from the main one, like \"The professor, who was the best in her field, agreed with the article.\" But again, that kinda fits into the general rule, because I would naturally pause between \"professor\" and \"who\" anyways. More of a non-natural rule, you also have to use a comma when ending a sentence spoken in dialogue but when there's still words after it in the overall phrase, like this:\n\n\"I found the evidence,\" she said.\n\nI think the link the other person provided as good rules too. But again, a lot of it is more prescriptive than descriptive. There's disagreements about when you can and can't use commas in every given situation, or there have been over the centuries when writing got more standardized. But, you're expected to stick to the rules in formal writing unless you're doing poetry or making some point about punctuation/grammar specifically.

We say \"Le gusta la casa\" because what you're shortening is \"La casa gusta a \u00e9l/ella\", meaning \"The house is pleasing to her\" to create a form that requires the indirect pronoun in English to get the point across. \n\nI think the third point is more relevant, but i believe it still ties into the first.  The example thoughtco gives is that you say \"No lo creo\" meaning \"I don't believe it\" vs \"No le creo\" meaning \"I don't believe him/her\". But again, I think the general rule is that with verbs where the object is a person you have to include \"a\" (i believe this is probably very oversimplified but works for this situation). So i think the full form for either phrase would be \"No creo el peri\u00f3dico\" vs \"No creo a Juan\", which as you can see, the second one that involves the person also clearly has a preposition, so you use le when the object is a person because when the object is a person you often have to use a preposition and make it the direct object. I'm not 100% sure about that last example but maybe a native speaker can back me up or correct me. \n\nAnd to your other example, you use \"preguntarle\" when you're asking a person, because again that would be an indirect object. If you're asking \"it\", like \"ya lo pregunt\u00e9\", \"I already asked it\" (idk for sure that that's natural but i think it's grammatically correct at least), you use lo because it's not a person so you'd be doing it in a direct object formation if you weren't using the pronoun", "created_utc": "1656908517.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ies4myr", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_vqr4kd", "parent_id": "t1_ies368u", "score": "4", "subreddit": "learnspanish", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rd6d"}, {"author": "Skystorm14113", "body": "I'm pretty sure this is right because I've been confused about this for forever but I've been practicing French recently and just looked it up yesterday in french and i was like, mind blown haha. \n\nSo yeah, lo and la are the direct object pronouns, and le is the indirect object pronoun meaning it replaces both the noun and the preposition. Which means in \"ayudar a Juan\" I believe it can be replaced by \"le\". If it includes a preposition, it's an indirect object, meaning it would get replaced by the indirect object pronoun, so either \"ayudarle\" or \"ayudar a \u00e9l\"\n\nBut I'm gonna do you a solid and google it and double check because now that i get it in French i think I'm primed to understand it in Spanish", "created_utc": "1656907598.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ies368u", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_vqr4kd", "parent_id": "t3_vqr4kd", "score": "3", "subreddit": "learnspanish", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rd6d"}, {"author": "Skystorm14113", "body": "I was gonna say lol, we can quibble about what skilled labor means but like, you're getting on your high horse about packing boxes?

Many things that we believe to be true now would've seemed irrational not long ago. People coming to different conclusions does not necessarily make them irrational.

I don't spend a lot of time talking about the greek goddess Athena. But i have to imagine that my friend Athena hears about it 100x more often than me. So definitely important to factor that into your feelings about a name. \n\nIt depends on what level bothers you. If you don't want anyone hearing your kid's name and then saying \"oh like X?\" then id definitely avoid a name like Dexter, which i don't think is independently known well enough beyond its associated characters. For me, I would probably only let that worry me if it was something being said more often than like 1 out of every 100th person, unless the association is really bad, at which point maybe if it was like 1 out of a 1000 ppl frequency of mentioning it it wouldn't be so bad. If it was a more than a 1 in a 100 ppl frequency, i might not mind if it was a good connection that i encouraged my kid to embrace. \n\nI'd say, I think the average person will think of Dexter or Dexter's laboratory when they see the name. However, there is some advantage that little to no kids will have any connection with the name, so it'll only be the adults you'll have to worry about, who hopefully on average won't even mention it. But im sure some ppl will say something about it to your kid at some point no matter what. So I'm not sure. I don't really love the name anyhow which clouds my opinion. Also important to consider the risk that ppl might think you intentionally named your kid after Dexter which would be enough to make me avoid it.\n\nFor what it's worth too, it was #533 last year which isn't bad, and it has one of the more interesting popularity charts I've seen. It peaked three different times about 20 years apart and at about the same popularity each time.

For me, the top names generally just feel boring after a while since i keep seeing them a lot. I like the name Charlotte, but it feels more and more standard and unoriginal as it remains popular.\n\nIf you just don't want your kid to be one of many in their class with the same name, that's impossible to control. I happened to only have one kid with my name for one year of middle school, even though my name was in the top 20. Your kid might just so happen to go to school with a lot of ppl with the 130th name. Also as you point out, even having the #1 name doesn't translate as a lot of kids with that name. In 1951, the #1 girls name in America was 4% of the just born population. In 2021 it was only 1%.\n\nIf your concern is the perception of the common-ness of the name, then you'll want to avoid names that have been traditionally popular as well as those that have been more recently popular. Or at least, avoid names that were popular in your age group. I would think of Lily as being way more popular than Scarlett, but Scarlett actually beat out Lily in 2021.

It's just kinda weird in this context. If it was someone i didn't know well then maybe I'd say that, but for any person I'm decent friends with id just say \u2764\u2764 in response (And no more than 2!). \n\n\"No problem\" and \"no worries\" which are generally average causal ways to say \"You're welcome\" (because that is a bit formal but not crazily so), just don't work here because you didn't like, do anything for someone, you just said \"happy birthday\". The only other thing i might say is \"Of course!\" which kinda has the meaning of \"well of course i would wish you happy birthday silly!\" in a nice way.\n\nThe other good option is to just continue the conversation a bit. Nobody really expects \"You're welcome\" after saying thanks for saying happy birthday, so no one would be offended if you didn't say it before continuing the conversation a bit. You can just do something simple \"Did you do anything to celebrate?\"\n\nSo tl;dr, I'd just do \u2764\u2764 if it was a fairly good friend and i didn't plan on continuing the conversation further, probably nothing at all if it wasn't a good friend and i didn't plan on continuing the conversation (although \"of course!\" could be used imo), maybe nothing at all if it was my best friend and bc i know they won't care if I don't say anything back to them, and nothing but a question if i do want to continue the conversation. \n\nI'd say based solely on the \"omg thanks\" this person sounds like someone who would see two hearts as a normal response to what they said. But if you're not an emoji person or it would feel weird somehow to send this person hearts, I think your safest bet is to just ask a simple question, just to continue the conversation for like a few more texts, the equivalent of small talk basically. \n\nAnd in general, I'd say that saying straight up \"You're welcome\", \"no problem\", \"no worries\" or \"of course\" with no punctuation marks sounds a bit cold and monotone to me. Of course, as you know, everyone texts differently and no one is quite sure exactly what tone the other person means. So there's no one size fits all solution. But in general, I'd say \"np\" or \"oh yeah nw\" or \"you're very welcome I'm glad i could help!\" while texting, which is to say id either use the shorthand for the phrases, add a few more words, and/or use an exclamation point. It really really depends on context and who you're talking to and even your own personality, but i think it's ok to go by a general rule that just saying \"You're welcome\" plainly like that in text comes off as a little rude/stiff/formal", "created_utc": "1656568321.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ieaal0c", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_vo0khc", "parent_id": "t3_vo0khc", "score": "3", "subreddit": "EnglishLearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2u8ap"}, {"author": "Skystorm14113", "body": "Not off topic but i wonder if there are subs that might know better than us.

Based on censuses they bounced around from home to home, presumably surviving off of people's charity, since Angelina never had a job in the census. Then, finally as a young adult, Carrie marries John and in 1930 they have two daughters, one named after Carrie, and one named after her mom. And of course Angelina is living with them. Well neither of these kids were mentioned in my friend's grandma's obituary so i wasnt sure it was her right family, until I finally found the right newpaper articles. One day, while Carrie and John went to work, and Angelina stayed home with the children, the gas heater was left on in such a way that gas filled the home. Carrie and John came home in the evening to find Angelina and their two small kids dead in the bedroom from gas inhalation. I just couldn't believe that after growing up with only her mom, Carrie had her mother and children all taken from her in one tragic accident. Pretty much the only family she'd ever known. And the kids were so young, 5 and 3. My friend tells me that her grandma, one of Carrie and John's later kids, has always had mental issues, and to me it seems obvious that generational trauma played a part.

I also consider gender (and sex for that matter) to be on a continuum. And I feel that in a perfect world, people could be whatever gender they want without the need of any surgery or medical anything. I certainly don't need anyone to get any surgery done for me to use the pronouns they like and to accept their identity. But how I see it is, we still don't live in that perfect world, and in the world we live in, we're still socialized to see certain genders as having certain attributes. Gender dysphoria is inseparable from a person's conceptions of gender, which are necessarily founded in the concepts of the society we live in, where a given gender is associated with certain traits and body parts. And who's to say exactly what circumstances cause gender dysmorphia in a person? A lot of info about humans is sorta just best guesses because it's a little bit illegal/unethical/impossible to perform scientific experiments that would get us answers to these questions. I definitely feel that one of the best ways to eliminate dysphoria related to gender or bodies in general is to raise kids to not feel that any aspect of your person is bad or less than. But the whole of society isn't going to get to that point any time soon. So people will still find that physical medical help along with psychological medical help is their best solution to gender dysphoria. And also, because of how society is, it's important to people to pass as their gender, which often necessitates leaning into stereotypes to be able to 'pass' to strangers. \n\nSo tl;dr, we live in a society. That is unironically the answer imo lol.\n\n(Also worth noting that there's some toxic binary obsessed queer ppl that think someone who uses different pronouns than the gender they were assigned, but doesn't do anything to change their look, are 'faking' being queer.

But actually, you are allowed to live your best life and do what feels good. Avoiding all negative emotions is not good and would not make you an empathetic person.

That is to say, a child named August will not be likely to meet as many people older than them with that name, and correspondingly not see their name in popular culture as much, but on the other hand the name is definitely considered trendy right now and depending on where you live it could actually be a very common name for kids your child's age. \n\nSame deal applies to Emilia, which was #40 last year, but in the 600s twenty years ago (but also has other similar names like Emma and Emily that might make it feel more common than it is. People with similar names tend to get grouped together in people's minds) versus Iris, which hit #107 last year but has remained low level present in the US for a long time, as opposed to Emilia which wasn't even in the top 1000 for a lot of the mid to late 1900s. So an Emilia is more likely to meet ppl their age named Emilia, but less likely to meet any ppl with the name overall, whereas the reverse is true for Iris.\n\nOk with that out of the way, I personally dislike the name Patrick for whatever reason. I like August as a name but I actually like Isaac more. I think Isaac August is way better. William August, August William, August Isaac, and William Isaac are also good. I prefer keeping August in there, and I can be swayed towards any of those combos if I think about it.\n\nFor the other names, Marie is overwrought imo. I never have really loved the name Iris either, so I actually would go with Emilia Therese. I think Isaac and Emilia sound great together!

Graduation ceremonies are typically thought of as boring and long, and often very hot and uncomfortable as well. I was very happy to not go to my own college graduation, and i would never invite even my best friend to my graduation because they're boring events that are not fun and kinda a waste of time. My high school graduation was only fun because me and my friend were in the front row facing that audience, so we played I Spy the whole time. And i went to a fairly small school so there wasn't even that many ppl to get through. \n\nSo just to be clear: 1) this is a normal event to not invite friends too. Even one's best friend. It's even normal to skip your own. So in no world should it be insulting to not be invited. He was doing you a favor if anything. 2) even if there's no limit, id guess that 95% percent of the audience was family members. It's still traditionally a family only event. You might've been the only friend there in the whole audience if you had gone, and i would say that would be kinda weird. And have you met this person's family? Id say it would be very awkward to explain why you invited this one specific friend to your family. And did you invite any of your friends to your graduation? Since you went to the same school and all i would guess you know whether or not it's normal to bring a lot of friends. 3) it is reasonable to assume that your older, already graduated friend doesn't care about signing yearbooks or taking pictures in grad gowns and all that. I had a few friends in the year above me, and i certainly didn't ask them to sign my yearbook my senior year. We werent super close friends but still, id find that quite weird. You could always just write your friend a nice text or congratulations letter and send it to them. Yearbooks need not be involved at all. Im actually working on writing cards for my friends who graduated recently myself. 4) my original advice still stands. You need to clearly state what bothered you about the situation. Saying you didn't know what day it was or whatever is not being honest. If you can tell reddit what is making you upset, but not your actual friend, then that is a problem. Do not expect ppl to be mind readers. Clear communication is vital in all relationships. 5) i just want to reiterate that this does give me a whiff of a codependent relationship, based on the fact that you expected to be invited to an event that would be unusual to be invited to, and lied or misrepresented why you were upset to your friend, which tells me you like him to be on the defensive and not know your real feelings so you can keep power in the relationship and feel needed when he says sorry and tries to reach out. And him being younger than you adds to my concern, because that too speaks to a desire for you to have power in your relationships. I'm a little worried that he is your only close friend, which would also be a tell.

And also supports my point of how language is not separate from culture. \n\nUp til now, you may have been learning \"Standard English\". But there's really no such thing. Everywhere you go native speakers have slightly different accents and grammar and vocabulary. Some people have unique words to just their towns, or even just in their families. I, for example, called shredded cheese \"sprinkle cheese\" for years and years, and only changed because ppl weren't sure what i meant. But it's what i grew up saying. In my hyper-local culture of my nuclear family, that was the right term, but in a slightly different culture it was not. Language is spoken over too vast a region and humans are too creative to stay consistent with terms and phrases. And the lived reality and culture of different ppl makes different terms necessary. \n\nSo my point is, i think the most logical approach is to do what us native speakers did, choose a region and speak with those phrases. Ask ppl who are from the region you most want to emulate what they call different things, and go with those terms until you find some reason to shift usage.

If he does, it almost certainly won't mention the cause of his death or any of the circumstances that brought about his suicide. My friend's father died of suicide and it of course doesn't mention anything about it in his obit.\n\nIn any case, first I would check [newspapers.com](https://newspapers.com). You can search without a paid account by going to the \"find by location\" section. You'll only be able to see the thumbnails and the date and name of the newspaper, which is enough if they have an obituary on that site. But not every newspaper for every place and date is on there.

They might be able to tell you a website their specific county or library system has to search it, or tell you the newspapers in the area and how you can check their details. \n\nBut of course, all of that will only really help you to try and find living relatives who can tell you more about them. Remember that they might not be open to talking to you or about their relative's suicide. I would definitely recommend trying to check for a family tree online for your dad's family once you know more about them, sometimes genealogists of the family aren't afraid to talk about the sadder or more controversial details of the family like the \"average\" person might be.\n\nGood luck!

And luckily I got the chance to travel to Spanish speaking countries in college, and also I now have friends who are native Spanish speakers. So I have the chance to practice when I want to.\n\nMy goal used to be to learn a lot of major languages to be able to speak to as many people as possible. But now I think I understand how hard communication is when you're not a native speaker. There's elements of culture you need to understand if you really want to speak a language well, and also a lot of the common spoken languages have a lot of local varieties, like Arabic, so I wonder how useful it is to learn the standard version when it's not really how anyone speaks. I'm not opposed to learning these languages, but I just don't have them as high on my list anymore.\n\nNow I'm trying to learn languages that I have connections to. For Cayuga, my college luckily had a class to learn it, and it was one of the most amazing experiences. Learning from a native speaker of a rare language in his ancestors' homeland that his own family was forced out of was very meaningful. And it reinforced for me how important it is to live on the land the language is from, because the land shapes the language and the culture. I then got the chance to learn Kichwa, which is one of the native languages of Ecuador, which I had visited beforehand. Again, it was an amazing experience to learn a language from a person who was from a country that didn't really encourage its use, and to show her that there are people that want to learn it, even those who aren't ethnically Ecuadorian.\n\nSo basically, if I was in your shoes, I would try to learn the rarest language that I had a familial connection to. I don't know what your ethnicity is, the Philippines are obviously super cultural diverse. If you really only have a connection to Spanish or Japanese, then I would recommend Spanish just because I like it and I think it's easier haha. But maybe you could start with both and see what you're inspired by. Or decide based on where you want to visit, or what media you want to consume.

So that is the explanation for the European dna quite probably. As easy answer, but a sad one for sure. \n\nAs for whether her maiden name is right and if the father's name is right, that can be hard to say. I've seen death records for kids where their parents' names vary from sibling to sibling. What I figure is important to remember is that the kids' death records are filled out by someone who them, like a spouse, who may have never met the parents and only heard their names once or twice. So no, you can never be 100% sure the names are right, especially with something like a Scottish name which is easy to confuse with a similar one. \n\nAnd again, sad but true, since black women were (and still are in many regards) one of the most vulnerable groups of ppl in America at the time, it's very possible her children are the product of rape, in which case it's not hard for me to imagine that she didn't want to say the real name of the children's father. He could be someone who raised them but wasn't a bio dad.\n\nBut still, even if none of that happened, it's very possible the name she used changed over her life, or that she was simply recorded wrong in the census. Maybe she was working as a maid in someone's house in 1870 and they recorded her with their last name instead of her own. If you've already tried every method for finding her in the 1870 and 1880 census, then it could be an unavoidable problem like that, which unfortunately might not be solvable. \n\nAlso good to note, people's ages are often incorrect as they get older. My own gg grandma's gravestone has her birth date 15 years younger than she was recorded in earlier censuses. Not to mention I've seen extreme variations in first names on censuses, specifically a Rose to Roxina to Lucinda or something like that. So you might have as good of information as you can get, but it might unfortunately still might not be right. \n\nAnd this might've been a mistype, but there is no 1890 federal census because almost all the records were destroyed. Idk what state censuses Georgia might've had.\n\nSo my guess if the children were born between 1880 and 1900 is that she never appeared in a census with her husband before he died, and that before that point she simply might've had a name variation in the census or she was just missed or ignored by the enumerator for one of a variety of reasons. \n\nUnfortunately, i don't have a lot of actual advice. I normally try to check newspapers for details but that's not likely to be helpful for black ppl in Georgia. I would check the 1870 census for anyone with a remotely similar name and age in the same town she lived in in 1900 and see what you get.

Just make sure that you give reasons for everything you're doing that isn't immediately obvious.

But if you were looking for someone's childhood census and you think you found a likely family that already has a people made and you want to merge, you need to really double check as much as possible, and then explain your reasoning in a way that other ppl can understand.

Presumably all Suchans spell their name that way. However, Korean has a syllabic alphabet, so the meaning is not evident from these characters, just the pronunciation. \n\nApparently, many if not most names in Korea are actually Chinese language in origin, even if the Chinese words have since become normal Korean words. Like it seems to me that Korea didn't just use Chinese characters and eventually Hanja to represent native Korean names phonetically, but rather they just adopted the Chinese words/names into use. However, Chinese languages have a lot of homophones, and Chinese words adopted into Korean made for even more homophones because Koreans don't have tones to differentiate some words like Mandarin does. So the actual character was important to be clear about what word was being used for the name. And even though names and now spelled phonetically with Hangul, except for a few native Korean names, people still also get corresponding characters to be clear about what their name is supposed to mean.\n\nSo yes, it depends on the hanja. Which would be character specific and might not be mentioned for every name in a piece of media.

At one point in history it became very fashionable to regulate English and introduce rules where there were none and to standardize everything. But it's not necessarily the \"right\" way to use English just because a handful of people that wanted to sell books said it was. It's just one way. Your ability to produce standardized English might suffer if you see too much material that's \"grammatically incorrect\", but perfect standard English is not how any real person talks in real life. I speak with constant errors and wrong vocab or pronunciation, all added on to my regional dialect. And also, even among grammarists there are disagreements about rules, or rules that are vague or have exceptions, or rules that have changed over the years. So it'd be hard to say what's truly \"incorrect\" even by official standards.\n\nIf what you're reading isn't a professional document, like an article or book of some kind, then the only reason to care about someone's grammar is if you can't understand what someone's saying because of it. I, for example, try to write how I speak, so I use certain phrases and spellings and lots of commas to get my voice and flow across. But nothing is lost if I drop the apostrophe in dont or don't capitalize an i. Nowadays phones autocorrect for us so it doesn't take any less effort to spell correctly, but before that i didn't feel like wasting my time capitalizing everything and including apostrophes. And back when i had my first phone each text cost me .3 minutes, so i wanted to save as much space as possible, and that meant dropping every apostrophe and unnecessary vowel (wht instead of what, dnt instead of don't). But the important thing is you could understand what I meant still.\n\nSo tl;dr, a lot of grammar rules are arbitrary, and people in real life don't speak with perfect grammar. It's ok to avoid \"bad\" grammar while you're still trying to learn the rules, but there's nothing wrong with \"bad\" grammar in casual speech or text, as long as it doesn't inhibit communication.", "created_utc": "1655354957.0", "edited": "False", "id": "icjpblt", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_vd9hl2", "parent_id": "t3_vd9hl2", "score": "2", "subreddit": "EnglishLearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2u8ap"}, {"author": "Skystorm14113", "body": "Yeah \"get to\" means \"allowed to\" or also more of the sense that you earned the right to do something.

That's just the case for English words in general. I had problems saying \"posthumous\" just yesterday. Now you consider names, which are not only old and can reflect traditional spellings that wouldn't be used nowadays, but also are often names from other languages besides English. Point being, people should stop feeling entitled to getting their name pronounced right. You're entitled to correct people and have them try their best, but wanting your name to get pronounced the same way every time in English is a fool's errand.

Nobody deserves for people to be mean about their name for being weird or hard, but the same way that nobody expects you to say loan words from other languages \"correctly\", like \"karate\" or \"jalape\u00f1o\", you also can't expect people in English to say names \"correctly\" first try, or even after multiple tries!

Even \"official\" grammar books (typically people trying to make rules where none ever existed in the first place) will say that the use of these is up to the individual.\n\nBut because those grammar books became so widespread, there's definitely generally agreed upon ways to use some of them.\n\n: is a colon. This is typically only used when you're about to list something. Like \"Anjali picked up five things from the store: bread, milk, apples, and ginger\". It can also be used when like, you're about to tell someone information in general, like \"Example:\". But that's something you'd see on homework assignments or scientific papers.\n\n; is a semi colon. I actually read a great book about the semi colon that talked about how people have been confused by it for centuries haha. It's even caused laws that used it to be interpreted differently. As a general rule for its use, I'd say you can use it instead of a period, when both parts could be a stand alone sentence, but you feel like the flow is better to keep them from feeling fully disconnected. Ex: \"The dirty white dog ran over to the people sitting on the bench; it was sad to see the state of stray dogs in the city\". You could've used a period instead of a semi colon, and even a comma to be honest, but I'd say this is one of the generally accepted times to use the semicolon. But people are very afraid of using it wrong and typically will avoid it altogether.\n\n() is parentheses. This can be used the same as - - which I just call dashes but I think are called em-dashes, or instead of two comma, or instead of ... if you're really feeling it. Again, punctuation has a lot of self imposed rules from people selling grammar books, but there's not really one true use of any of these tools. Typically, I use it when I'm saying something extra that's beside the main point. I actually use parentheses more when writing answers in this sub than I do in my normal writing, or certainly more than if I was writing a novel. Like if I'm telling someone a rule and then I want to give an example: \"You need to use your for possessives (\"your coat\" as opposed to \"you're coat\", which would mean \"you are a coat\")\"\n\n, is a comma, as you know. In my opinion, the most general rule for when to use it is whenever you would have a slight pause while saying the same sentence out loud. It is also used to differentiate in a list of things, like in the colon example above. So here's an example: \"I walked to the store, and then I turned around\". In real life, speaking out loud, I would pause a little between \"store\" and \"and\". Maybe not even very noticeably, but more than I pause between other words in the sentence.\n\nBut remember, writing is an imperfect way to represent spoken language. Just like spelling often doesn't translate perfectly to how a word is said, punctuation also doesn't. And punctuation is even weirder used to represent silences and pauses and pacing in a person's speech. People do not naturally speak with parentheses and commas, but that's how we translate it to the page. So that's why punctuation often doesn't follow consistent rules all the time.", "created_utc": "1655155008.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ic9267b", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_vbho28", "parent_id": "t3_vbho28", "score": "3", "subreddit": "EnglishLearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2u8ap"}, {"author": "Skystorm14113", "body": "The links you've given are for two different IPA sounds. \\[\u00e6\\] vs \\[\u0251\\]\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPA\\_vowel\\_chart\\_with\\_audio", "created_utc": "1655154090.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ic900fv", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_vblrnt", "parent_id": "t3_vblrnt", "score": "6", "subreddit": "EnglishLearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2u8ap"}, {"author": "Skystorm14113", "body": "I would assume it meant the actual act of feeding.

One cannot exist without the other. Like I used to think it was a doable goal to become fluent in a bunch of languages, but now I realize that even if I became fluent in the 'standard' version of a language, I would never have the control a genuine native speaker would have, because there's so much cultural references and experiences in language and involved in communication. It is of course, also important to remember that no country or language is a monolith. That too can be a bit discouraging because it means that especially for something like Italian, the dialect you choose to use will be regional and maybe only make you seem fluent or near native to a small group of people. But I've tried to get away from the need for my learning of a language to be perfect. I don't intend to totally change the culture I understand and have grown up with. Some languages I learn to connect more to a culture and get a truer perspective of it, and also to show respect to the cultures that have been undermined, like Scottish Gaelic and Cayuga and Kichwa. And others it's more just to prove I can do it, and to be able to easily travel to those places that speak it. It works out that even in America there are people I wouldn't want to talk to, and learning their specific regional slang would only get me closer to a group of people I by and large don't want to connect to. So by that I mean, there's going to be different people that speak Italian, they're not all the same. But no matter what, there's no harm in only going as far in a language as you're inspired to go. I myself am actually taking a community class in beginners' Italian. I find the people in the class to be very nice.

But it's not a common name either way so I don't know if it would come up a lot. Other than that, there's a lot of variations in how English speakers say 'a', so there's a lot of different possibilities. The variations for that second vowel sound, for example, would be the 'a' pronounced as an /ah/, like in spanish, an English /er/ sound with the 'r', and /uh/, and maybe another I can't think of. My first instinct, without the /th/ would be something like \"Am er ANT uh\", where the vowel sound in 'am' and 'ant' is a very obnoxious /eh/ sound which is particular to my regional dialect.\n\nInara would be \"Ee NAHR uh\". This is the one that I think would have the least variation. I think you'd be pretty unlikely to hear any alternate pronunciations, although it could pop up.\n\nSo basically, none of these would be hard for English speakers to say, it's just about whether you care if the average American will say it closely to the Spanish spelling, or if you care if the pronunciation is consistent. If you care about consistency, I would say nix Amaranta.

And a lot of times you need articles with proper nouns too. Like, say there's a fall festival in my town. \"Are you going to the fall festival Saturday?\" would be ok, but so would \"Are you going to Fall Fest Saturday?\" In the second, I am using the proper name of the event, so I don't need the article. It's not a perfect rule though. If I said \"Are you going to the state fair?\" you would still have to use the article for the more specific event, \"Are you going to the Rhode Island State Fair?\" Here I think of it like \"Rhode Island\" isn't a specific enough indicator to remove the article, even though it feels like it is, it's just an adjective. If the Rhode Island state fair was called \"RhodeIslandpalooza\", then you wouldn't need the article, although you could still use it \"Are you going to (the) RhodeIslandPalooza?\"\n\nSo in your examples, I would say that 9 is possible to drop the article, because if you're talking to people that live in the same place as you (or have referred to the town you're speaking of earlier in the conversation), \"Town\" has become enough of a proper name on its own, because there's only one place you could be talking about. You wouldn't have to use the article if you said the name of the town, \"It's been built in Mapleton\". So because \"town\" for many people can only refer to one place, it is acceptable to stand in for the name of the town with no article. But if it's not clear what town you're referring to, you should use the article.\n\n3 is something a different poster pointed out a little while ago. You actually can't say \"at morning/day/evening\" only \"at night\". For some reason, night is a specific enough time that it doesn't always need the article. It shares this quality with \"noon\" and \"midnight\", which you would typically also not use articles with, and which you would also use \"at\" not \"in\" with. The other generic times of day all need to be \"in the morning/evening/afternoon\". I will hazard a guess to say that it's because there's a definite time that \"night\" starts and ends, but not the other times of day. In your example sentence however, all the times of day (night/afternoon/day/evening/morning) would require \"the\". Again, assume the article is needed, it pretty much always is. In this example, the better question would be \"why does night need an article here but not all the time?\" That's hard for me to answer. It might be better to just remember that \"at night\" doesn't need it, and probably every other situation does.\n\n1 could be acceptable to drop the article, but it would be among a group of people for whom \"Competition\" is essentially a proper noun. Like a group of cheerleaders might say \"we crushed it at nationals this year\" instead of \"we crushed it at the national competition this year\", because \"nationals\" has become a proper noun in the lingo of the sport. But \"competition\" is a bad choice of word to become a proper noun because it's still a little too vague, if there was one iconic competition that everyone called \"competition\", then it would be ok. But you probably wouldn't speak like that except to other people that know your sport well.\n\nAnd just to drive my point home, with no articles in 10, it sounds like both \"cupboard\" and \"home\" are proper nouns, like names of some specific thing. It sounds like you're saying \"Have you looked in Cupboard in Hall?\" Like they're some iconic feature I should be familiar with. It doesn't matter if you only have one cupboard and one hall, unless you named them, you're using the article. You should pretty much always be using the article.
