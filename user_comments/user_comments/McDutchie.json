Here's something I wrote about that five years ago.\n\n----\n\nThis article assumes familiarity with the standard built-in \"getopts\" utility (not to be confused with \"getopt\" which is external, non-standard and very unportable). If you need to read up on \"getopts\", the POSIX documentation is great:\nhttp://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/getopts.html\n\nSupporting long options like --option or --option=argument in shell scripts has long been a problem. The external 'getopt' utility is often used to support this, but it is hopelessly fragmented and unportable. The Darwin/Mac OS X version of 'getopt' doesn't even support operands containing spaces, not even when quoted! The GNU variant of 'getopt' is good, but you can't count on its presence if your shell code has to run on every POSIX-compliant system.\n\nIt would be so nice if we could just use the shell built-in utility \"getopts\" (a completely different animal in spite of the similar name), but its algorithm is set in stone due to its long history and it will never support long options. However, for the same reason, it is extremely consistent across shell implementations and you can count on it working correctly. Manual long and short option parsing proved too much hassle to be worth it, so I was ready to settle with \"getopts\" and use only short options for the shell program I am writing.\n\nBut my \"eureka!\" moment came when it dawned on me that a string like \"--option=operand\", representing a GNU-style long option \"option\" with the operand \"operand\", can be reinterpreted in terms of a short option \"-\" with the operand \"option=operand\". Likewise, a simple long option \"--option\" can be reinterpreted in terms of the same short option \"-\" with the operand \"option\".\n\nThis is possible because traditional/historical Unix short option parsing allows writing short options and operands without any separating whitespace, for example, \"-Fname\". The built-in \"getopts\", being a fossil, continues this tradition. So if we imagine the option letter as '-' instead of 'F', then the result \"--name\" has become a GNU-style long option without an operand.\n\nWriting \"--name\" together also stops it from interfering with the special \"--\" argument that stops option parsing. That too just works out.\n\nSo all we need to do is to get \"getopts\" to parse the additional short option \"-\" plus its operand, which means adding \"-:\" to the end of the option string. (It can't be at the beginning because getopts would then think the option string is itself an option. It can be anywhere else in the option string. The end is a sensible location for it.) After parsing with \"getopts\", GNU long options then show up with \"-\" as the option name and \"option=operand\" in $OPTARG.\n\nSo, at this point, all we have really left to do is intercept the special \"-\" option and shuffle the contents of the option variable and $OPTARG to make further parsing in the customary \"case\" statement more convenient. This is fairly trivial because GNU option styles are easy to parse: the option and the operand are separated by \"=\".\n\n(Many GNU programs also support an alternative form \"--option operand\" with a whitespace separator, but I'm not going to bother with that here; it would greatly complicate the code because it becomes much harder to distinguish between options with and without operands.)\n\nThe implementation details and loose ends are best shown by example. Consider a traditional \"getopts\" parsing loop supporting only short options:\n\n\t#! /bin/sh\n\t### begin traditional short options example ###\n\t# parse options\n\topt_number=1 opt_list=''\n\twhile getopts ':n:f:Lvh' opt; do\n\t  case $opt in\n\t  n )\n\t    printf '%g' \"$OPTARG\" >/dev/null || exit $?\n\t    opt_number=$OPTARG ;;\n\t  f )\n\t    exec <\"$OPTARG\" || exit $? ;;\n\t  L )\n\t    opt_list=y ;;\n\t  v )\n\t    showversion; exit ;;\n\t  h )\n\t    showversion; showusage; exit ;;\n\t  ':' )\n\t    printf \"Option -%c requires an operand.\\n\" 1>&2; exit 2 ;;\n\t  '?' )\n\t    printf \"Option -%c unknown.\\n\" $OPTARG; 1>&2; exit 2 ;;\n\t  esac\n\tdone\n\tshift $(( $OPTIND - 1 ))\n\ttest -n \"$opt_number\" && printf 'Number n is %g\\n' $opt_number\n\ttest -n \"$opt_list\" && printf 'List option is on\\n'\n\ttest $# -gt 0 && printf 'Remaining argument: %s\\n' \"$@\"\n\t### end traditional short options example ###\n\nMy long option parsing method adds just eight lines of code plus some changes. The differences are:\n1. the extra \"-:\" at the end of the getopts option string;\n2. the \"if\"..\"fi\" block that handles the special \"-\" option and splits \"OPTARG\" to support long options;\n3. the long options as alternatives to the short options in each case selector;\n4. an extra manual check for an operand for the options that require one, as this is not automatically checked for long options;\n5. the final \"* )\" case selector that handles unknown long options.\n\n\t#! /bin/sh\n\t### begin newfangled long options example ###\n\t# parse options\n\topt_number=1 opt_list=''\n\twhile getopts ':n:f:Lvh-:' opt; do\n\t  if test \"$opt\" = '-'; then\n\t    # support long forms --option and --option=operand\n\t    opt=${OPTARG%%=*}\n\t    test \"$opt\" = \"$OPTARG\" && unset OPTARG || OPTARG=${OPTARG#*=}\n\t  fi\n\t  case $opt in\n\t  n | number )\n\t    test -z \"$OPTARG\" && printf '--%s requires number.\\n' \"$opt\" && exit 1\n\t    printf '%g' \"$OPTARG\" >/dev/null || exit $?\n\t    opt_number=$OPTARG ;;\n\t  f | file )\n\t    test -z \"$OPTARG\" && printf '--%s requires filename.\\n' \"$opt\" && exit 1\n\t    exec <\"$OPTARG\" || exit $? ;;\n\t  L | list )\n\t    opt_list=y ;;\n\t  v | version )\n\t    showversion; exit ;;\n\t  h | help )\n\t    showversion; showusage; exit ;;\n\t  ':' )\n\t    printf 'Short option -%c requires an operand.\\n' 1>&2; exit 2 ;;\n\t  '?' )\n\t    printf 'Short option -%c unknown.\\n' \"$OPTARG\"; exit 2 ;;\n\t  * )\n\t    printf 'Long option --%s unknown.\\n' \"$opt\" 1>&2; exit 2 ;;\n\t  esac\n\tdone\n\tshift $(( $OPTIND - 1 ))\n\ttest -n \"$opt_number\" && printf 'Number n is %g\\n' $opt_number\n\ttest -n \"$opt_list\" && printf 'List option is on\\n'\n\ttest $# -gt 0 && printf 'Remaining argument: %s\\n' \"$@\"\n\t### end newfangled long options example ###\n\nDiscussion:\n\n--- Portability ---    \nThis new[*] type of long options implementation is very fast and appears to be very portable. It is written in pure POSIX shell code and uses only built-in shell utilities. No external programs are launched. The behaviour of the built-in 'getopts' is extremely consistent among shell implementations, so this long options code should work everywhere. My extensive tests have confirmed this so far: bash, ash/dash, ksh, mksh, zsh, NetBSD 'sh' all work. If it breaks anywhere, I would love to hear about it.\n\n--- Extreme portability ---    \nThe assignments opt=${OPTARG%%=*} and OPTARG=${OPTARG#*=} in new if..fi block are parameter expansions which are supported in every POSIX shell of the last fifteen-ish years, so they are now very portable. If this code needs to work even on historical Bourne shells (Heirloom 'sh' is a good reference implementation), they can be replaced as follows:\n\n\t  if test \"$opt\" = '-'; then\n\t    # support long forms --option and --option=operand\n\t    opt=`echo \"$OPTARG | cut -f1 -d=`\n\t    test \"$opt\" = \"$OPTARG\" && unset OPTARG \\\n\t    || OPTARG=`echo \"$OPTARG | cut -f2- -d=`\n\t  fi\n\nThis comes at a performance cost, as it involves launching two or four external processes per loop iteration -- one or two subshells for command substitution (`...`) and one or two invocations of the 'cut' program, depending on whether the long option had an operand. The rest of the code should work as-is (tested with Heirloom 'sh').\n\n--- Quirky side effect ---    \nAs a side effect of implementing long options as a special case of a particular short option \"-\" with operand, it becomes possible to combine a long option (with or without operand) with short options without operands, like:\nexample.sh -abCdE-longopt=operand which is equivalent to:\nexample.sh -a -b -C -d -E --longopt=operand\nHopefully, no one will notice. ;-)\n\nIt would be interesting to see if this idea catches on.\n\nHave fun,\n\n- M.\n\n[*] Is this really new?

To pass on values, use those arguments instead; this is safe.\n* This way, you can safely use any shell code in the here document without any escaping or quoting problems, closing it with `EOF` on a line on its own (no initial whitespace allowed).\n* Side note: If you want to be able to indent the `EOF` terminator so the code looks neater, you can use `<<-'EOF'` instead of `<<'EOF'`. The extra dash cause initial tabs to be stripped from *every* line of the here-document including the one containing the terminator.

I think the neurodiversity movement should learn to accept these different experiences of autism.\n\nBut do keep this in mind when advocating for other neurodivergent people. For many of us, it's a part of us that we don't want to lose, or we would lose ourselves. Instead, focus on fixing specific problems where possible.

Verbal, but quite seriously disabled in other ways, and I too need support to live my daily life. I've been part of the autistic community since before the birth of the neurodiversity movement (I wrote [this book chapter](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-13-8437-0_3) about my experiences) and I'm still part of it.\n\nI agree with many of your criticisms, though. I totally agree that being verbal is a privilege, because mainstream society strongly values verbal people over non-speaking people. At the same time, though, being verbal can also make it harder to get help; if you're verbal, people assume you can do anything. I can't reliably do basic things like get up in the morning, or go shopping, or do paperwork.\n\nSo that does give me empathy with those who experience serious disability. I think that excluding autistic people who don't want to be autistic is a major failure of the neurodiversity movement as it currently is. I can tell you for a fact that it was never originally the idea of neurodiversity to exclude people like you, but that's too often forgotten now. Your experience is valid. You are entitled to basic human rights as much as any other autistic person.\n\nHowever, remember that if you only see the neurodiversity movement online on social media, you're only seeing the angriest and least reasonable parts of it. Social media makes everything and everyone angrier and angrier. Neurodiversity activists are no exception. Social media is toxic that way. It's designed to pit people against each other. Social media companies make a lot of money off all the controversy they generate, because controversy generates clicks and ad views. Meanwhile, the less visible part of the neurodiversity movement, those working mostly behind the scenes, are a lot more reasonable. I know many of these people.\n\nFor instance, I'm an autism trainer now. An autistic friend of mine started a company that provides autism training to first-line care workers. The training is entirely autistic-run and autistic-designed. In our training, those carers learn about autism in a way that they never have done before \u2013 we give them practical experience-based information on how to communicate with autistic people and help them, and not \"book knowledge\" like diagnostic criteria that is not useful to them.\n\nSo, yes, I absolutely think you should take that job.

Ze voeren de druk op de regering op: zonder extra geld doen ze hun werk niet meer.**\n\nJos Verlaan & Rik Rutten    \n17 juni 2021 om 23:11    \nLeestijd 2 minuten    \n\nMinder thuiszorg voor gehandicapten. Geen nieuwe inburgeringscursussen. Geen begeleiding voor werklozen. En het Rijk kan fluiten naar de opbrengst van gemeentelijke boa-boetes.\n\nGemeenten dreigen hun werkzaamheden neer te leggen als de rijksoverheid niet snel extra geld beschikbaar stelt. Een [motie](https://vng.nl/sites/default/files/2021-06/zoetermeer_a_samenvatting_en_preadvies_motie_zonder_geld_geen_gemeenten.pdf) die oproept tot zo\u2019n staking kreeg deze week op het congres van de Vereniging van Nederlandse Gemeenten (VNG) de steun van het overgrote deel van de gemeenten.\n\nMet het dreigement gaat de hoog oplopende strijd die gemeenten voeren met het kabinet om het geld een nieuwe, hardere fase in. De afgelopen tien jaar namen gemeenten allerlei landelijke taken over, klagen ze, maar hun budget groeide nauwelijks mee. De coronacrisis kwam daar bovenop. Met alle maatregelen uit het klimaatakkoord vrezen de bestuurders de komende jaren extra kostenposten.\n\nDat voelen burgemeesters, wethouders en burgers inmiddels overal. Ruim 30 miljard euro verdeelt de rijksoverheid jaarlijks over alle gemeenten. En dat is volgens de lokale bestuurders zeker 1,5 miljard euro te weinig. Alleen al voor jeugdzorg. Daar komen de Wet maatschappelijke ondersteuning en andere posten bij. Financi\u00eble zorgen zijn meer regel dan uitzondering. Eerder dit jaar meldde NRC dat honderden gemeenten [flink hebben moeten bezuinigen](https://archive.is/o/dRm6M/https://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/2021/02/28/de-lucht-verdween-uit-de-lokale-begroting-a4033640) of hun belastingen hebben moeten verhogen om hun begroting voor 2021 sluitend te krijgen. Ook met zulke ingrepen kwamen 120 gemeenten er niet uit: zij konden geen sluitende begroting indienen.\n\nNu is het genoeg, zeggen de gemeenten bijna unaniem. Hun zorgen hebben ze al vaak geuit, maar niet eerder werd gesproken over een staking. Als er dit najaar geen geld bij is gekomen, zo dreigen ze in de motie van woensdag, dan gaat de deur naar Den Haag op slot. Nieuwe taken die het kabinet aan de gemeenten wil overdragen, zoals de Inburgeringswet en Omgevingswet, worden dan genegeerd. Bestaande taken worden teruggeschroefd, het overleg met een nieuw kabinet stopgezet.\n\n\u201eDe taal in de motie is fors, maar de ervaring van de afgelopen jaren heeft geleerd dat het nodig is om de aandacht van het Rijk te vestigen op de financi\u00eble nood waarmee ze gemeenten heeft opgezadeld\u201d, zegt wethouder Marc Rosier (VVD) uit Zoetermeer.\n\nIn zijn gemeente organiseerde de weerstand tegen de rijksoverheid zich als eerste, onder de vlag van Raden in Verzet. Dat initiatief groeide in korte tijd uit tot een spreekbuis voor honderden gemeenten. \u201eWe zijn in 2018 de gemeentepolitiek in gegaan om iets voor de mensen te betekenen\u201d, zegt raadslid Marijke van der Meer van Z\u00f3! Zoetermeer. \u201eMaar sindsdien zijn we alleen maar bezig met bezuinigen. Lokaal spelen zich drama\u2019s af, die halen nooit de landelijke pers. En ook bij verantwoordelijk minister Ollongren van Binnenlandse Zaken is het kwartje nog niet gevallen.\u201d\n\n### Jaarlijks tekort van 2 miljard\n\nHet grootste struikelpunt zijn de decentralisaties. Gemeenten zijn in de afgelopen jaren verantwoordelijk gemaakt voor de gehandicaptenzorg , de jeugdzorg en voor begeleiding op de arbeidsmarkt. Die overdracht van taken moest niet alleen de uitvoering verbeteren, vond het kabinet-Rutte II, maar ook geld besparen.\n\nDe praktijk viel vaak tegen. Bij de jeugdzorg ontstond een jaarlijks tekort van bijna 2 miljard euro. Toch zegde de rijksoverheid slechts mondjesmaat extra geld toe. De nu voorgestelde werkweigering vloeit voort uit die boosheid.\n\nGemeenten hopen dat het kabinet en de formerende partijen overstag gaan en financieel bijspringen. Maar daar was de afgelopen maanden weinig van te merken. Staatssecretaris Paul Blokhuis (Volksgezondheid, ChristenUnie) noemde het eerder dit jaar \u201eniet chic\u201d om als demissionair kabinet het hele gat voor de jeugdzorg te dichten: meer dan 300 miljoen euro wilde hij niet bijleggen.\n\nEind mei oordeelde een commissie dat de rijksoverheid daarmee [veel te weinig hulp bood](https://archive.is/o/dRm6M/https://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/2021/05/27/arbitragecommissie-rijk-moet-miljarden-bijleggen-voor-jeugdzorg-a4045178). Pas toen besloot het kabinet nog 1,3 miljard euro toe te zeggen aan de gemeenten \u2013 maar dan eenmalig. Dat is niet genoeg, zeggen de gemeenten: na volgend jaar is het gat weer even groot. En dat is alleen de jeugdzorg.\n\nVeel wethouders houden er al rekening mee dat hun opvolgers na de gemeenteraadsverkiezingen, volgend jaar maart, weinig andere keuzes hebben dan n\u00f3g meer bezuinigen. Het gezamenlijke dreigement zien ze als een laatste strohalm. Een noodkreet.

True and false are different: true is non-zero, false is zero. Since arithmetic expressions in in bash, ksh, zsh, dash, etc. use C syntax and concepts, the same is true for them.\n\nThe `let` and `((`\u2026`))` arithmetic commands convert a C-style true/false result into a shell-style exit status result so that their exit status can be interpreted as true or false shell-style.

We raised/are raising five kids between us, from previous relationships and our current one. So we've got some experience. We're also in touch with a lot of other autistic parents. Most of our social circle are autistic.\n\nOne thing we've noticed, with ourselves and our autistic parent friends, is that children are going to be whoever they are, and parents have remarkably little influence on their personality and development. As long as you don't seriously traumatise or neglect them, they'll grow up to be who they are supposed to be.\n\nChildren need three basic things:\n\n1. food and drink\n2. secure attachment\n3. a roof over their head\n\nAs long as you provide those, you're basically fine. Sure, you have flaws. So do we. I've not met the first flawless parent yet. Those who think they are flawless are usually the worst.\n\nIt sounds like your son is probably neurodivergent in some way. ADHD is a possibility. It tends to run in the family along with autism. None of that is your fault. And even though it can make life super hard, it's not actually a bad thing. Autistic and ADHD folks have a right to be here like anyone else.\n\n> How did you cope with the fact that you knew you're not able to do \"what you're supposed to do\"?\n\n1. Parenting books.\n2. Meeting other autistic parents. Joining an online community with other autistic parents in it.\n\nIt certainly helped that I knew I was autistic before I decided to become a parent. You did not have that advantage. But it's not too late to give yourself a break now, and get an idea of what good autistic parenting looks like. You might just find that you didn't do very badly at it after all.\n\n> I blaimed myself for not being able to listen to him cry -- the sound was too loud and heartbreaking and hurt my ears, brain and body.\n\nCan strongly relate. My oldest (now 18) had colic as a baby. Thinking about that is upsetting to this day.\n\n> I blaimed myself for not being able to play with him (and be happy at the same time) 15 hours a day -- I felt quilty every time someone else took care of him, because I was ELATED to get a break.\n\nOf course you urgently needed a break and you were perfectly right to get one. Remember that it's in your child's interest to have a parent who is not falling apart.\n\nNot one parent in the world can cope with playing with their child 15 hours a day, let alone happily. Also, it's good for children to be taken care of by multiple people -- it gives them more experience with how humans work, reduces social anxiety, and such.\n\nA secure attachment doesn't mean that you and your child are joined at the hip. It means your child is happy to go off to spend time with someone else, secure in the knowledge that you will still be there for him when he comes back.\n\n> I could not understand why my tolerance for sounds and social interaction was not the same as other parents'. I didn't see them flip in a blink of an eye, screaming to stop making that noice. I felt insane, others must have thought I was too.\n\nHopefully having more understanding of yourself will help you now.\n\nThe screaming is quite unfortunate, but, again, I've done it myself. It's not that uncommon. Kids are resilient. As long as that sort of thing doesn't define the whole of your relationship with him, it won't cause permanent damage.\n\nI think the test for that is if they seem to be chronically afraid of you in some way or other. If not, things are probably okay.\n\nI've always apologised to my kids after losing it with them, regardless of their age. (Wait with that until you've calmed down and actually mean it.) I also make some time to talk about it, acknowledge their feelings, and answer any questions they have. I think that's important for both their well-being and mine. Plus, it sets a good parenting example: it teaches your kids that being perfect is not actually a requirement in life, but that acknowledging your mistakes and atoning for them is important.\n\nYou do want to make sure you don't lose control of yourself too often, because that would make apologising ineffective (plus, it would be very destructive to your own wellbeing). The way to avoid this is to learn to recognise when you need a break, and then take that break before you lose it. I've never managed to be perfect at that, but it does get better with practice.\n\nAgain, taking care of your own needs is in your child's interest. Not only that, taking responsibility for yourself sets a good parenting example -- it teaches a healthy sense of boundaries. What you want to avoid is your children becoming somehow responsible for your comfort and well-being.\n\nAlso, don't be afraid to use aids like ear plugs, noise cancelling headphones, etc. -- never mind that it looks 'weird', you've got needs and it's in your child's interest that you meet your own needs so that you don't lose it with them.\n\n> I was unable to follow through with \"if you throw the milk on the floor again, you won't get milk at this meal\" type of punishments, because they felt too harsh.\n\nThen they probably were too harsh. Your parenting instincts told you something -- I would listen to them if I were you. The way your parents raised you sounds quite bad, you don't want to repeat that.\n\n> I'm still not able to be the parent I want to be. I'm too empathic, too anxious, too tired and overwhelmed, too everything to teach him dicipline...\n\nGood parenting is about modelling love, respect, healthy boundaries, etc. Discipline is *way* down the list.

This is easiest on plain POSIX shells, which modernish is primarily designed for.\n\nOn zsh it's a bit different as zsh is not POSIX compliant by default, so modernish needs the sh emulation mode. So if you do `. modernish` as normal, zsh will switch to sh mode and your native zsh code will no longer work properly.\n\nHowever, zsh supports this great thing called 'sticky emulation', and modernish works with it. If you initialise modernish as follows:\n\n    emulate -R zsh -c '. modernish'\n    use somemodule ...\n\nthen modernish will be run in sh mode while your own script will continue to work in zsh mode. You can simply use any function from your zsh script as normal and zsh will switch emulation modes on the fly as needed.\n\nNote you will *not* want to use the `safe` module in this use case, as modernish safe mode (which disables global split & glob) is designed for POSIX shells, and native zsh already has its own variant of that.\n\nThere are some more things to be aware of as well.

There's nothing special about the first list of commands, except that the second list of commands is executed if and only if the last command of the first list exits with status zero (\"success\").\n\nSo, things like `[[` and `[` and `test` are just commands, that exit with status zero for a \"success\"/\"true\" result and status one for a \"failure\"/\"false\" result.\n\nThe first one, `[[`, is a reserved word (basically half command, half shell grammar). The second and third, `[` and `test`, are just bog-standard ordinary commands like `ls`, `cp` etc. This means their use comes with certain [pernicious pitfalls](https://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashFAQ/031) that are avoided by `[[` (at the expense of increasing general confusion even further).\n\nBecause these are just commands, they have to be separated by spaces.

A synonym of `[` is `test` (except it doesn't need the final `]`)\n\nShell arithmetic expansion, which you would use to calculate `szam % 2`, is a whole different and separate thing.

It has a vibe that seems to come from the Fast Man/Raider Man album, except it rocks harder. I like it!\n\n> D8 How I Learned To Earn Rewards\n\nThis sounds like Frank Black and the Catholics doing a Rolling Stones song, with an intermittent infusion of Chuck Berry (the \"dedication to medication\" bit). Very nice.\n\n> D9 I Just Can't Break It to You\n\nThe closer is another straightforward FB&C-type rocker.\n\n----\n**General thoughts**\n\nOn the podcast, Black Francis commented that these sound like old Pixies songs. I can't agree with that assessment. There's not a single scream or shout or any acoustic rhythm guitar, and the only loud-quiet-loud dynamics are on \"Hey, Debussy\". Most of this is traditional, classic rock and roll with a mild flavouring of Frank Black quirkiness.\n\nThe live-to-two-track recording and Frank's electric rhythm guitar give the whole thing a strong Catholics vibe. Joey and Paz go along with this, and their contributions add a lot and sometimes really make the song, but that doesn't make it sound any more \"Pixies\" to me. I think \"Hey, Debussy\" is the only one that properly sounds \"Pixies\" \u2013 but definitely new Pixies, not old.\n\nBut that doesn't make any of this bad. I happen to love Frank Black's work with the Catholics and I'm really not precious about the whole Pixies legacy thing, so this set has been a treat to me. And the lack of echoing overproduction is also a big plus.

It still sounds overproduced but it's very much improved over *Head Carrier*.\n\nAnyway, my first impressions (except for the singles which I've already played many times):\n\n*Cain:* Very nice opening. To me it recalls *Motorway to Roswell*.\n\n*Graveyard:* I'm not a fan of the lyrics -- too clich\u00e9. Cool licks though, great bassline, and some nice dissonance. Not many surprises, I don't find this keeps me on my toes.\n\n*Catfish*: It's been growing on me. Nice tempo. It feels like the chorus is lacking something, like a key change or something.\n\n*Fate*: God I love this! It manages to be classic Pixies even with BF's low-pitched growl. Those time signature jumps really do it for me. Dave must have had a ball, he sounds like he was playing in the kitchen. :)\n\n*Ready*: Pixies doing an actual love song, and succeeding! Really excellent. Recalls \"I Burn Today\" a little bit, but with added wistfulness. Not too long, which is good.\n\n*Silver Bullet*: A true songwriter's song. Hauntingly beautiful. This one is going to be on repeat soon.\n\n*Long Rider*: WOW! A headbanger sing-along like only the Pixies can do. This should have been a single instead of Graveyard Hill, it has absolute hit potential.\n\n*Surfers Muertos*: Beautiful instrumentation, but overproduced. Paz's voice is almost lost in the echoing and it sounds autotuned. :(\n\n*St Nazaire*: Very convincing angry breakup song. Much better screamer than *Baal's Back* (on Head Carrier). *Baal's* seemed put on. This one here might be less extreme but it sounds like he means it.\n\n*Bird*: The most Pixies song Pixies 2.0 have done, without a doubt. Best ditty since La La Love You! And I just love Charles' growl on the studio version. But the live versions that have been on YouTube for a while are slightly more up-tempo which I prefer.\n\n*Boone*: Perfect out-of-body dream song. Kind of similar to *Bird Dream Of The Olympus Mons* but way better.\n\n*Death Horizon*: This recalls *Selkie Bride* (off Frank Black's *Honeycomb*) a lot, the song has a very similar feel and structure. The Selkie Bride also literally pops up again in the lyrics of *St Nazaire* -- coincidence? Both albums were influenced by a divorce Charles was going through, so maybe not.\n\nOverall I've got to agree with the rave reviews. And now I'm sad because I can never have a first listen again.

It's a stance that shouldn't come as a surprise when one considers the uncompromising nature of Pixies' very best music, but it's still disconcerting to have questions answered briskly, without elaboration and - truth be told - a tad charmlessly. Maybe he's not a morning person.\n\nThe new album - Pixies' seventh - is called Beneath the Eyrie. The name was inspired by the old church in Woodstock, New York, where it was recorded.    \n\"There was an eagle's nest outside,\" Thompson says. \"David [Lovering] the drummer noticed it. The producer suggested the title. I thought it was a stupid title. Then, he brought it up a month later and I thought it wasn't so stupid, so I just went ahead with it.\"\n\nIt's the first time a Pixies album has not borrowed a song name or lyric in its title. \"It was feeling restrictive to just follow the old rule.\"\n\nBeneath the Eyrie is the second album the band have released since the departure of bassist Kim Deal - she left to focus on The Breeders, the group she founded with her twin sister, Kelley in the early 1990s. The album features the same personnel that made the spirited 2016 record, Head Carrier.\n\n\"We didn't book as much studio time as before,\" he points out, \"because we knew we would work together well having done it before.\"\n\nThe 54-year-old Bostonian is an old hand at the art of songwriting, having released a fabled 18-track demo cassette, The Purple Tape, in 1987. It led to an album deal with the revered English label, 4AD. And yet, he says, it remains as difficult as ever to write something special.\n\n\"It's not easier now to just arrive at a good song,\" he says. \"The goal is to come up with a good song, but sometimes you don't know [if that has been achieved that] when it's finished. Sometimes it's obvious, many times not. There's an ambiguity to it.\n\n\"I'm not better at spotting the difference [between what's good or not],\" he adds. \"Maybe it's easier to write a song now than it was, but it's no easier to write a good song.\"\n\nHe brought 30-odd songs and fragmentary compositions to the recording session and they were whittled down to the 12 that appear on the album. \"Songs never feel like they're in my brain. Once an idea has been executed on an instrument, it's out of your head and in the room.\"\n\nHow does he begin a new song? He seems bored by the question. \"You write on the guitar or sometimes on keyboard. I can write on anything. You do things sort of the same. There are always exceptions to the rule. I could write a song on a kazoo, but it's not going to feel dramatic, because the concept is still the same.\n\n\"The concept is still guitar, bass and drums with a vocal - that's the formula we're working with.\"\n\nIt may be the most basic format in rock, but Pixies mastered it. They have influenced everyone from Nirvana to Radiohead and The Frames, although Thompson has little interest talking about any of those bands.\n\nHe's more interested in discussing Tom Dalgety, the producer who helmed their latest album and its predecessor. \"He's smart, he's younger than us, he's a good time manager, he's a nice guy, he's a man of few words. He has a lot of vision and he doesn't sit around talking about it. He probably knows that it's a waste of his time and a waste of the process.\"\n\nLast year, Pixies played a residency at London's Roundhouse in support of their debut album, Surfer Rosa. The reviews were largely ecstatic. Thompson took it all in his stride. \"It was interesting,\" he says, \"because it was so formatted - so scripted, if you will. It didn't feel so different because we play so many songs from that album anyway. I can't say that it was a stroll down memory lane or something like that.\"\n\nThis year marks the 30th anniversary of Pixies' magnum opus, Doolittle, but Thompson has no plans on this occasion to perform the album in its entirety live. Might the band play more tracks from it on their forthcoming European tour, which includes an Olympia, Dublin date? Thompson doesn't hesitate. \"No.\"\n\nDid he realise they had made something special when they first went to the studio? \"For which album?\" Doolittle. \"Joey [Santiago, the guitarist] and I knew we had something special when we made the demos. You make some demos, you work hard on them, you have a cassette of them. Then you sit around the floor of your apartment and you play it back and it's like 'Woah!, that's good - it sounds like music'.\"\n\nThompson has been in prolific form since rekindling Pixies at the early part of this decade. 2014's Indie Cindy marked their first album in 23 years - and the last with Deal. He says he would release more music if the industry was structured in such a way that would allow new material any time he wished.\n\n\"The pace has been set by the market,\" he says, \"otherwise, I'd be putting out a record a year or more.\"\n\nUnlike other artists, he is not bothered by the pitiful royalties paid by the streaming giants. \"Streaming is very convenient,\" he says. But not for the artist surely? \"Yeah, whatever - it's show business, man. What am I going to do about that?\n\n\"Artists are making more money at the concerts. The artists complaining about the royalty rates on streaming don't tend to mention that there's a lot more demand for them to play in concert and people are willing to pay a lot more money for that experience than they are for the streaming experience.\n\n\"You could make the argument that artists were overpaid for a long time - I'm not making that argument, but I am saying that maybe people were overcharged when it came to buying albums.\"\n\nThe band, with former Zwan and Queens of the Stone Age bassist Paz Lenchantin replacing Deal, remain a formidable live proposition and Thompson says he's looking forward to taking the new songs on the road in Europe.\n\n\"Touring has not changed much and that's good,\" he says. \"The tech aspects are obviously better and the venues have improved, but that feeling of walking on stage and looking out at a crowd has not changed one bit.\"\n\nHe's happy to be playing the Olympia. \"A wonderful building and a wonderful neighbourhood.\" Having played big outdoor shows here in support of the likes of Red Hot Chilli Peppers (in front of more than 100,000 people at the Phoenix Park) and Arcade Fire at Marlay Park, Pixies aficionados will be pleased to see Thompson and friends kick up a racket at a more intimate environment.\n\n\"It's good to see the whites of their eyes,\" he says. \"It's easier to make that connection.\"\n\n'Beneath the Eyrie' is released on September 13.

It's not well suited for this use case. You have the right idea with the `while read` loop.\n\nTo answer your question properly I would first need to know if you're trying to convert your scripts to portable POSIX+modernish scripts (which would run on any POSIX compliant shell and OS) or if you're happy keeping them bash-specific. (See [Two basic forms of a modernish program](https://github.com/modernish/modernish/blob/ab087009bf0033ed99d7f9750df1bd3b4ba8d23c/README.md#user-content-two-basic-forms-of-a-modernish-program)). But hey, I might as well answer both.\n\n----\n\nThe latter case (bash-specific) is the simplest, so I'll start with that. You can keep using arrays, process substitution, and other built-in bash functionality. (Although, what you wrote should work on ksh and zsh as well.)\n\n**First,** instead of using `cut` I would use the local splitting abilities of `read`, which is built in and therefore much faster:\n\n    while IFS='|' read -r f1 f2; do\n        ts[$i]=$f1\n        ip[$i]=$f2\n        i=$(( i + 1 ))\n    done < <(sqlite3 db \"sql statements;\")\n\nThe above is nothing to do with modernish, it's pure bash. Note the `IFS` assignment is local to the `read` command, so won't persist.\n\nNote also that I added the `-r` flag to the `read` command, which disables backslash processing. You really should always use `-r` with `read` unless you've got a reason not to.\n\n[A little extra tip: if you don't like the awkward syntax of shell arithmetic, the [`var/arith`](https://github.com/modernish/modernish/blob/ab087009bf0033ed99d7f9750df1bd3b4ba8d23c/README.md#user-content-use-vararith) module provides alternatives so you can say `inc i` to increase `i` by one. It also lets you do things like `if eq i 2; then \u2026` which to me seems a great deal nicer than `if [ \"$i\" -eq 2 ]; then ...`.]\n\n**Second**, I would [`use sys/cmd/harden`](https://github.com/modernish/modernish/blob/ab087009bf0033ed99d7f9750df1bd3b4ba8d23c/README.md#user-content-use-syscmdharden) and then harden the `sqlite3` command like this before using it:\n\n    harden sqlite3\n\nThis implements automated paranoid error checking, so that your program reliably terminates if `sqlite3` produces an error (even if the error happens within a subshell environment), instead of continuing with incorrect results.\n\n----\n\nIf you want to make your program into a portable modernish script, you've got a bit of a problem: you can't use arrays, or process substitution.\n\nAs /u/SusuKacangSoya pointed out, modernish does provide stacked variables to portable scripts. The stack is still a little primitive in that it's strictly LIFO (last in, first out): popping values only works in reverse order. I have plans to make the stack more flexible and perl-like, but that is some ways off still.\n\nWith arrays out of the way, we still need an alternative for the `<(`process substitution`)`, which is also not portable. The POSIX idiom is to use a here-document combined with a command substitution instead.\n\nSo that gives us something like:\n\n    #! /usr/bin/env modernish\n    #! use sys/cmd/harden\n    harden sqlite3\n    ...\n    while IFS='|' read -r ts ip; do\n        push ts ip\n    done <<EOF\n    $(sqlite3 db \"sql statements;\")\n    EOF\n\nThen to process the input in reverse order, you would use another loop:\n\n    while pop ts ip; do\n        # stuff with $ts and $ip\n    done\n\nNote: The next 0.15.x alpha version of modernish (or the current development version, if you keep up with the current git code) will provide a portable variant of process substitution for the POSIX shell in a [`sys/cmd/procsubst`](https://github.com/modernish/modernish/blob/ab087009bf0033ed99d7f9750df1bd3b4ba8d23c/README.md#user-content-use-syscmdprocsubst) module. The advantage over the here-document method (apart from avoiding the very awkward here-document syntax) is that it provides parallel processing so it won't block, and will work with commands providing an infinite data stream. It has no advantages over bash built-in process substitution, except portability: it works on every POSIX shell. The syntax is a bit different as it's not possible to replicate the bash syntax in a shell library: it uses a command substitution combined with a special command, `%`. So in the next alpha version (or current dev version) you can use process substitution portably, like this:\n\n    #! /usr/bin/env modernish\n    #! use sys/cmd/harden\n    #! use sys/cmd/procsubst\n    harden sqlite3\n    ...\n    while IFS='|' read -r ts ip; do\n        push ts ip\n    done < $(% sqlite3 db \"sql statements;\")\n\nSorry for the length.

It seems to suggest that Linux 2.6.23 made it possible for the real ARG_MAX value to vary (it links to [this commit](http://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=b6a2fea39318e43fee84fa7b0b90d68bed92d2ba)), but the Linux headers still specify the old value (which I suppose must be a minimum real value, then).", "created_utc": "1556838814.0", "edited": "False", "id": "emd109t", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_bk00or", "parent_id": "t1_emcxlb2", "score": "1", "subreddit": "commandline", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s4oq"}, {"author": "McDutchie", "body": "> Linux (3.16, x86_64) defines ARG_MAX as 131072 (128k)\n\nHow did he figure that?

This was not the case.\n> \n> In light of Prime Minister May's statement last night, I believe we now have a few more days. If the United Kingdom is in a position to approve the Withdrawal Agreement with a sustainable majority by 12 April, the European Union should be prepared to accept a delay until 22 May.\n> \n> But 12 April is the ultimate deadline for the approval of the Withdrawal Agreement by the House of Commons. If it has not done so by then, no further short extension will be possible. After 12 April, we risk jeopardising the European Parliament elections, and so threaten the functioning of the European Union.\n> \n> The Withdrawal Agreement is and has always been a compromise. A fair compromise in which both sides obtained some but not all of what they sought. It is the kind of compromise through which the European Union was built. The kind of compromise that enables the European project to advance. The kind of compromise we need at the moment.\n> \n> Much of the debate in the House of Commons has related to the future relationship between the European Union and the United Kingdom. The European Union stands ready to add flexibility to the Political Declaration, to pave the way for a close economic partnership between the European Union and the United Kingdom in the future.\n> \n> We stand ready to refer to a range of options, from a free trade agreement, to customs arrangements, to a Customs Union all the way to the European Economic Area. The openness we have shown from the start could be laid out, in purest clarity.\n> \n> On the EU side, we stand ready to launch the talks and negotiations on the future partnership as soon as the Withdrawal Agreement is signed. Before the ink is dry. The Commission's negotiating team is in place. Michel Barnier, our Chief Negotiator, is ready. I would expect the same level of readiness on the United Kingdom side.\n> \n> Whether this happens or not depends on the United Kingdom. The European Council gave the United Kingdom the time and the space to decide.\n> \n> Yet I believe that a \u201cno deal\u201d at midnight on the 12 April is now a very likely scenario. It is not the outcome I want. But it is an outcome for which I have made sure the European Union is ready.\n> \n> We have been preparing since December 2017. We have always known that the logic of Article 50 makes a \u201cno-deal\u201d the default outcome. We have long been aware of the balance of power in the House of Commons.\n> \n> In that time, the Commission has published 91 preparedness notices, 32 non-legislative acts, 19 legislative proposals and 3 Communications. We have visited all 27 Member States to support their preparations. We have held 72 seminars with the Member States.\n> \n> The measures we and the Member States have taken will mitigate the worst impact of a \u201cno-deal\u201d scenario. The protection offered is real. The measures will make sure that EU and UK citizens can continue to live and work where they are at the moment. They make sure that planes can take off and land. We have adapted our financial instrument to make it possible to help fishing communities. We have identified the ways in which law enforcement cooperation can continue. We have taken steps to mitigate disruption on our financial markets.\n> \n> The measures we have taken are time-limited and unilateral. They provide a cushion for key EU interests at least until the end of the year. But disruption will be inevitable for citizens, for businesses and for almost every sector.\n> \n> The United Kingdom will be affected more than the European Union because there is no such thing as a \u201cmanaged or negotiated no-deal\u201d and there is no such thing as a \u201cno-deal transition\u201d.\n> \n> And whatever happens, the United Kingdom will still be expected to address the three main separation issues.\n> \n> *   Citizens' rights would still need to be upheld and protected.\n> *   The United Kingdom would still have to honour its financial commitments made as a Member State.\n> *   And thirdly, a solution would still need to be found on the island of Ireland that preserves peace and the internal market. The United Kingdom must fully respect the letter and spirit of the Good Friday Agreement.\n> \n> \u201cNo-deal\u201d does not mean no commitments. And these three issues will not go away. They will be a strict condition to rebuild trust and to start talking on the way forward.\n> \n> At the European Council next week, we will listen to Prime Minister May's intentions and decide how to proceed. The principles that will guide my actions are clear. I will work until the last moment to avoid a \u201cno-deal\u201d outcome.\n> \n> The only ones who would benefit from such disruption are the opponents of the global rules-based order. The only ones who would cheer are the populists and the nationalists. The only ones who would celebrate are those who want both the European Union and the United Kingdom to be weak.\n> \n> The European Union will not kick any Member State out. I will personally do everything I can to prevent a disorderly Brexit and I expect political leaders across the EU27 and in the United Kingdom to do the same.\n> \n> Thank you.", "created_utc": "1554308634.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ek16ivl", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_b8yr6j", "parent_id": "t3_b8yr6j", "score": "260", "subreddit": "unitedkingdom", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhqb"}, {"author": "McDutchie", "body": "Je geeft dus zelf ook toe dat er geen sprake was van \"voedselzekerheid\" onder Stalin.
