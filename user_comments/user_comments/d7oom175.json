Looks like you guys are just like us with how traditional everything is which in my opinion is how it should be. The man has his role which is to be the provider and ask for the family\u2019s blessing and to be that dominant figure in the household. The woman\u2019s role is the supportive care taking wife who makes sure the family remains in tact and happy. The more I read what you said the more I realize it\u2019s exactly the same as here but maybe with one difference because literally my whole ancestory is just 100% Egyptian with 0 mixing so I\u2019m not sure if people here are fully against mixing or not. Personally my family wouldn\u2019t mind as long as they are Muslim and that\u2019s it Alhamdullilah.\n\nThe culture thing could take some time to get used to especially if it\u2019s completely different but I think discovering new cultures is one of the most beautiful things our world has to offer.

Take hitler for example, the man that was responsible for the death of 6 million different souls. You would automatically assume he would deserve the absolute worst of the worst right? Well by the No heaven and hell logic, the man killed 6 million people and absolutely nothing is gonna happen to him. He died by suicide, meaning he got to choose the exact way he died and the exact place that it took place and every possible condition he can ask for after knowing he was being hunted down. So now what? His soul is just gonna perish and absolutely 0 justice will happen for the 6 million souls he took? It just makes no sense to me how we can do whatever we want on this earth with 0 repercussions. A man can kill another man and receive the death penalty and have his soul taken but what good does that do? Where is the justice for the family? For the innocent life he took?
