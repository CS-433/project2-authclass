If music is a product of globalization, why not just acknowledge that and stop trying make it...the opposite of that?\n\nGenerally I think the concept of nations is dated, and that applies to football as well. Most of the players of the respective national teams play in other countries than the alleged \"nation\" they represent once a month (or less), and some players have never set a foot in the country they claim to be a part of (fx in case of double citizenship when players can pick and choose between which national team they feel like having higher chances of being a part of).
