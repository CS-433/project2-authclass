What makes it different from popular science books, or history, or other types of books?\n\nThere are studies out there about this which can explain it better than I can, but basically,  fiction engages your brain differently than non-fiction -- it engages your imagination and emotional responses more, and in turn enables faster acquisition. You can read non-fiction if you'd like, but fiction allows for a faster and richer learning in comparison. \n\n>what makes books (print or audio) a superior form of input over things like magazines, podcasts, and TV? \n\nAs mentioned above, fiction overall is better in comparison and books in particular have a richer vocabulary as compared to other media, as well as a more beneficial words to minutes ratio. \n\nThink of it this way, there are movies out there where the entire dialog consists of less than 3000 words for a 2 hr movie. In a typical audiobook narration, the pace is usually 2200 words / 15 minutes, give or take, so 2 hrs of reading and listening at audiobook pace = 17,000 individual words read / listened to.\n\n>And do you think that input alone, whether from books or other sources, is sufficient to build *active* knowledge of vocabulary? \n\nYes, and I have the experience to back this up. Regular input though reading and listening can build to active knowledge. Though of course speaking practice is always good, I've spent long periods without speaking a language -- input only -- and were able to have sustained conversations afterwards when the opportunity presented itself.   \n\n>Do you worry that using books as your primary source of input means that you'll sound excessively formal, or mix formal and informal registers in the wrong context?\n\nNot at all! As I mentioned, I like to read popular fiction -- thrillers, adventures, etc. These types of books are full of dialog of all different registers, from formal to street slang, from legal jargon to science and military terms. If a word is in \"regular speech\" it is more than likely that it will show up in the dialog of these types of books. \n\n> Would you still recommend this for languages with diglossia, like Arabic, where the written form is extremely different from the spoken form?\n\nI've done this with Korean, where the written verb form is slightly different, as well as French which uses the simple past for narration only. In both cases, once one is aware of the rules, the issue between the written and spoken form is non-existent in my opinion. \n\nDialog in books always follows the common spoken forms. \n\n> At what point do you think reading books should constitute at least 50% of a learner's study time?\n\nAs soon as one is comfortable with it. For most people, this may be in the intermediate / B1 neighborhood. But I myself have done this from scratch with Spanish. I learned just by doing comparative reading of books w/ audio. It's a fun way to start, but it may not be for everyone.  \n\n>How do you recommend involving grammar study into this, especially for languages with very different grammar from one's native language?\n\nI myself try to just absorb the grammar from context of reading, and then look up certain things as needed, given how many grammar resources are out there. But this may not be for right for everyone, or with every language. So, yeah, study the grammar as you'd like.

I would love to unpack it more and hear your thoughts more in detail about it. \n\nI've always thought that every time we monitor a camera that records RAW or Log, unless we're looking at it in log, we're using a LUT to start with. The aforementioned REDgamma4 is just a LUT, no? It takes the Red Log Film RAW signal from the sensor and applies a luminance curve to it so it can be viewed in Rec709. \n\nIf we're then referencing a color card on set while looking at it in REDgamma4, or Arri 709 in case of an Alexa, we'd really be just looking at how the color card exposes with those LUTs -- which is a good workflow, and would give you proper results, but we're still using a LUT, albeit a \"basic\" luminance LUT without any color tweaks.\n\nIf we're using a color chart to test the LOG signal -- which is again a good way to get proper exposure -- we still haven't cut out the use of a LUT for color purposes, we just temporarily disabled if for exposure purposes, no?\n\nOnce we're in the color grade, we're either using a LUT to take the Log signal to 709, or we're using some kind of base grade, hand drawn curve, what have you -- the last two would remplace a base LUT, but basically would just do the same thing as a LUT for the purposes of taking Log to 709, with every other creative grading decision adjusting the image before or after the LUT or base grade. In this process, the information provided on the color chart will inform our decisions as to which way we'd wanna push to color, but that information wouldn't replace the use of a LUT, or base grade, no?\n\nI always think of a LUT as \"print stock.\" We have our negative, RAW/Log, and we need an answer print to look at it, that's our LUT -- and now we need to tweak it to make it look better, so we adjust our printer lights -- the pre LUT nodes in this case -- to change the image before it exposes to the print stock, our LUT. And post LUT adjustments are like a bleach bypass. We have printed our neg to an answer print, now we're gonna manipulated \"in the soup\" to make the print stock look more like the way we want it to. \n\nAgain, this is just my understanding / approach to exposure and color.
