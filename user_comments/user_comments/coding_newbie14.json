I bought one (Les Liaisons dangereuses) that turned out to be too difficult for me.\n\nIf you want a great book that's not to long but still from one of the great,classic French authors, check out Bel-Ami from Guy de Maupassant. It's a classic that French high school students usually read in class. It's not too hard and the story is very thrilling.\n\nSo my top book recommendations(without knowing anything about your taste in books haha) would be:\n\n1. Bel-Ami from Maupassant\n2. Le rouge et le noir from Stendhal\n3. Les trois mousquetaires from Alexandre Dumas.

I know though, that if I would had been reading books and listening to podcasts etc prior to my arrival in France, I would have spoken a lot better.\n\nA teacher is great because they give you explanations, feedback and corrections. But to really develop, you need to read, you need to listen to content that you are genuinely interested in. And just the content in school is usually not enough.\n\nI would really recommend that he gets a lot of comprehensible input. He can for example start reading comic books like tintin (Tim und Struppi, see link below to Swedish amazon) and Dragon Ball. Comic books have the advantages that they are action packed, and if there are words you don't get, you can follow the plot anyways, thanks to the pictures.\n\nI'd also start out by watching Easygerman [https://www.youtube.com/c/EasyGerman](https://www.youtube.com/c/EasyGerman) (I'd watch 20-30 minutes per day).

I also started with learning the personal pronouns and the articles in the different cases. They were really confusing at first (der is default for masculine words but also used for feminine words in dative etc). I made my own cards for those with example sentences. \n\nBut I haven't studied verb conjugations. They will come naturally more or less. Now a couple of months in, I've started learning with anki which cases that are used with which prepositions. I know some of them already, but it becomes much more efficient to just learn them with anki. \n\nMy conclusion from learning Spanish on my own and now learning German is that your main grammatical input should be from comprehensible input. But when you have gotten quite a lot of input, look up essential things you need to know by heart and learn it with anki, while still relying on a heavy input. I think it's the most efficient way. \n\nHow this cleared some things out.
