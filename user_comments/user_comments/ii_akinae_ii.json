typical day schedule like for you?\n\ni would get up before class and get breakfast (usually a couple of baos or \u7cbd\u5b50 from a street vendor, or \u6cb9\u6761/\u8c46\u6d46 if i got up early enough to go to the fancy place a bit further away).  then, morning class would start.  iirc, it\u2019s two hours long, with a 10 minute break in the middle.  we receive a schedule on our first day that outlines exactly when and where each session will be.\n\nonce the morning class is over, we dismiss for lunch.  i pretty much always ate lunch at the school, because it was so cheap and incredibly tasty.  there\u2019s a table where only chinese speaking is allowed, but i usually sat at one of the other tables because they were more advanced and it was hard for me to keep up with their conversations.\n\nafter eating, i\u2019d go to the activity room and usually play \u9ebb\u5c06 mahjong with people until afternoon class started.  afternoon class was the same format as morning class.  my schedule was different day to day, and they stagger the classes, so i didn\u2019t always let out at exactly the same time as other students.  everyone was always out by 6, so often there\u2019d be a group of us who would go get food somewhere locally.  if there was an activity that night, i might or might not join.  for those who didn\u2019t want to join the paid activities, students would often watch a movie or play games in the activity room.  or sometimes i would go do things on my own, like visit the local \u7f51\u5427 PC cafe.  and then i\u2019d spend the rest of the evening working on homework and practicing.\n\non the weekends, there was almost always an activity to join.  i tried to go as often as possible, but i didn\u2019t always go.  when i didn\u2019t go, i\u2019d often spend time practicing and/or exploring the town.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Were there any hidden/unexpected expenses?\n\njust the activities.  they were a pay-per-activity thing.  some were free (like playing sports together in the side yard), some just had nominal fees of 10-20 yuan to pay the teacher for their time, and some were a few hundred yuan because they were field trips.  the food was very cheap everywhere, so i had actually budgeted too much money for that, which made it a bit easier to pay for activities.\n\ni had to visit the doctor once, but it was very inexpensive.  i think i paid 50 yuan tops for the visit and medicine.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>What were the teaching style and class materials like?\n\neach of my teachers had a different style.  \u949f\u8001\u5e08 (Teacher Zhong), my \u201cprimary\u201d teacher, was somebody who was very firm and direct in his style.  he is the kind of teacher that made me really work for his approval, but it felt great to earn it.  once we had established some rapport, one day he actually took me to his buddhist temple to show it to me and get a meal together.  he was a bit standoffish at times, but he was a great teacher.  i picked up a few vocal habits from him, including saying \u201c\u5bf9\u4e0d\u5bf9?\u201d quite a lot, haha.\n\n\u9b4f\u8001\u5e08 (Teacher Wei) was my reading/writing teacher.  he was very cool!  in my \u201cfarewell\u201d speech (which all students give at the end of their stay), i called him my \u8001\u54e5, my big brother.  reading/writing was my least successful subject, but \u9b4f\u8001\u5e08 was very kind & patient with me.  he adapted my homework to emphasize writing more when he realized i was falling behind in that regard, and we started going a bit slower through the material.  it was really helpful and supportive that he was able to adapt like that.\n\nAnna\u8001\u5e08 (Teacher Anna) was my speaking/listening teacher.  she was the warmest, kindest, and most helpful of the three teachers.  i adored classes with her.  she had fun games we\u2019d play together, and she liked doing little trips to solidify learnings.  for example, one day we went to the museum together to practice giving directions!  she had me hold the GPS and give her instructions as we drove.  it was difficult but her learning style was always practical and fun!  also, she always spoke slowly & clearly enough for me to understand her.\n\nas for the class materials: you get to pick from a few options.  on my first day, \u949f\u8001\u5e08 presented several different textbooks to me and asked me which one i would prefer to learn with.  we went through the pros and cons of each and i ended up choosing the \u201cintegrated chinese\u201d books.  the school store had copies for sale (much cheaper than you could get them on amazon), so that\u2019s where i got my copies.  in three months, i went through the entire first textbook, and a bit less than half of the second textbook.  i worked very hard to go through all of that, so i feel like i was relatively fast paced: other students will be differently paced, maybe faster, maybe slower.", "created_utc": "1666361945.0", "edited":

the food is amazing there!), you interact with pretty much all the teachers, to varying degrees. they're very kind and intelligent, and they care for the students very much.\n\nthere are multiple options for housing. i chose to live in the dorm at CLI itself. i think this is the \"safe\" option, especially if you're a total beginner with the language. if you want an extra challenge, you could do a homestay, but the program is already quite challenging imo, so it might be best to stay in the dorm. plus, the dorms have western toilets, which you're not always guaranteed to see everywhere. and you're with other students, which is nice and builds community.\n\nmy best piece of advice for you, if you decide to go, is to practice the language as much as you can. it's exhausting (literally, your brain will hurt), but it's so important. and if you can't say everything you're trying to say in chinese, even just little things can be very useful, like replacing \"let's go\" with \"\u8d70\u5427\" or being sure to use the appropriate greetings with people (e.g. \u5403\u597d\u4e86\u5417\uff0c\u53bb\u54ea\u513f\uff0cetc). the way to begin getting natural with the language is to use it often, even if your usage is limited. don't be afraid to make mistakes. language is a sort of semantic negotiation: you can make mistakes, but if people can still understand your meaning, that's what matters. and you *build* from there.\n\none last thing... i'm going to switch my tone to be a little bit harsh, so please forgive me, but it needs to be said. do NOT go there and treat these people like they're servants to you, or like you're better than them. it wasn't common, but i saw one or two students take this incredibly offensive attitude, and it drove me insane. these are wonderful people who have built this beautiful and effective program, and you should be humble and treat them with the respect and gratitude they deserve. culturally, it would not be appropriate for them to stand up for themselves against this attitude, so they don't -- so if you see it among your fellow students, please don't tolerate it.\n\nplease feel free to AMA here! :) and if you do decide to go to guilin and study at CLI, i hope you remember me and DM me: i'd love to stay in touch over wechat in case you need any tips while you're there (plus, selfishly, i'd love for you to pass along my well-wishes to my former teachers, haha).", "created_utc": "1666322593.0", "edited": "1666323120.0", "id": "it5sbvf", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_y974or", "parent_id": "t1_it5rwbk", "score": "1", "subreddit": "ChineseLanguage", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qyz1"}, {"author": "ii_akinae_ii", "body": "[done](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChineseLanguage/comments/y9i7es/my_experience_at_the_chinese_language_institute/)!

(they say no dairy too, but i was already vegan, so idk how that affects things.) i eat mostly fruits, vegetables, rice/quinoa/oats, and some nuts/seeds. there are certain vegetables they say are high histamine (like spinach), but i don't personally have problems with most of those, so i think there is some amount that's specific to the individual.\n\n**intermittent fasting**: when i'm having a flare-up, intermittent fasting (with an evening meal, not midday) is really helpful. \n\n**prolonged fasting pt. 1**: i also do prolonged fasting at least a couple times a month. around 20-24h, your body initiates autophagy, wherein your body gobbles up dead cells, misfolded proteins, and other gunk. it's hypothesized that this is important for eating up that pesky spike protein, and possibly even some of these microclots. they're developing some medications now to trigger autophagy, but that's kind of spooky to me when there's such an easy way to trigger it ourselves. i am a firm believer in the power of fasting. i do a 40-hour fast every week. it's pretty easy: stop eating at 8pm on saturday, skip all of sunday, break fast monday at noon.\n\n**prolonged fasting pt. 2**: at around 72h of fasting, your body does something incredible. (and it's documented: you can google this and read more literature about it.) the dormant immune stem cells (yes, stem cells!) turn on and begin replacing old, damaged immune cells. i worked up to an 88-hour fast a couple weeks ago. (it took a couple attempts: fasting is a honed skill imo.) my body needed a couple days after the fast to build up glycogen stores (i was still weak during that time), but after that, i experienced a small boost to my energy & symptom reduction that hasn't gone down yet.\n\nthe literature says i'd need to do this kind of fast once or twice a month for 4-6 months in order to fully \"reboot the immune system.\" i fully plan to do it.\n\n**note on fasting**: you should NOT do a prolonged fast during or immediately after acute infection. wait a couple weeks to let your body heal before engaging in this different form of healing.\n\n**other things i do**: wim hof breathing exercises, gentle diaphragm self-massage, symbicort turbuhaler (used to be 2x/day, now just 1x/day), meditation, healing-focused progressive sleep hypnosis (i don't really think this does anything, but now i'm superstitious, so it's a harmless habit lol), avoid strenuous activity that \"pushes my energy envelope\" and risks triggering PEM.\n\n**other things i've seen recommended around**: quercetin (i make sure to supplement this via my food [e.g. red onions, dark berries] to avoid taking an additional pill), nattokinase (anticoagulant: i've got some on its way to me; need to research to see if i need to *add* it to the baby aspirin or *replace* it), DAO (don't do this until you're in a stable place with low histamine diet + antihistamines; this should be a last resort to manage histamine)\n\n**overall**, this is the regimen that keeps me capable of continuing my life. i'm very grateful to have developed this over the last few months so that my life isn't entirely stolen away. don't get me wrong, i still have symptoms: but they would be totally unmanageable for me without this routine.", "created_utc": "1664974376.0", "edited": "1664976434.0", "id": "ir571po", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_xvopgg", "parent_id": "t1_ir4m4oh", "score": "1", "subreddit":

we aren't vegan because of an intrinsic reward system.  we're vegan because it's the right thing to do.  if you only care about pure rationality and you demand an explanation for why you \"***should***\" be vegan, then we may be at an impasse, unless the environmental argument resonates with you.\n\n60% of food-related GHG emissions (which comprise 10-15% of annual global GHG emissions) are from animal agriculture.  if you care about your family & friends, veganism will help save the planet and therefore improve all of their lives.  for every fraction of a degree warming we prevent, we massively improve conditions on earth.  you might say to yourself, \"but my personal choices are a drop in a hopeless bucket.\"  i vehemently disagree.\n\nwhen you order a vegan meal from a restaurant that only has one vegan option, their sales go up and they'll consider keeping it on the menu or even expanding options.  your friends you're dining with will see your tasty vegan option and consider getting it next time.  the effect spreads outward.  you buy a vegan option at a grocery store, same thing.  their sales go up, and the manufacturer pays attention to this too: companies will put their research dollars into better & better options if we continue to support the economy of veganism / a plant-based diet.  your purchasing decisions matter very much in this regard.\n\n(note: my argument ends up being more an argument for \"why you should eat a plant-based diet\" rather than \"why you should be vegan.\"  if you're not going to be vegan \"because there's nothing in it for you\" / \"because you don't care about animals outside your immediate circle\", imo eating a plant-based diet is still ***radically*** better than just giving up and going full

(i've experienced peripheral neuropathy in the past, so the hands/fingers wasn't as scary as the chest burning.)  it usually goes away within a day or two, but i try to drink a lot of water when my chest burns, plus i put ice on the affected area.  it seems to help but idk: i think time is just the biggest factor.\n\nregarding what the other person said: i totally agree with most of it but want to add a couple things for your consideration:\n\n\\-- for magnesium supplements, magnesium threonate is best (i wouldn't even bother with the other magnesiums tbh: and i used to take magnesium glycinate religiously long before LC lol), and you should take it at night because it will help your sleep quality.  i also take zinc with mine as zinc is a cofactor for magnesium, but zinc is a bit finicky: you need to take it with food, and you shouldn't really take other supplements (besides magnesium) with it, as zinc can have adverse effects when taken directly with things like vitamin C.  so, you can skip the zinc if you want.  it's much less important than the magnesium itself.\n\n\\-- anti-histamine diet is pretty important for me, but i've found that not everything that's declared low or high histamine has the same effect for me.  i think it comes down to whether something is going to have an inflammatory effect in your body: and high-histamine foods can be the culprit for this.  for instance, i thought for a long time that anti-histamine diet wouldn't work for me because i never had adverse effects to avocado (which is generally listed as a high-histamine food), but i've noticed that most other things considered high-histamine do trigger inflammation for me.  so, it took me longer to adopt the anti-histamine diet.\n\n\\-- personally, i've also had a lot of luck with prolonged water-based fasting.  about 40 hours with nothing but water (i don't even do my vitamins with it anymore, as it broke my fast once and wasted a lot of effort for me LOL).  some folks hypothesize that the autophagy response triggered by fasting helps to eat up all that spike protein and other nasty bullshit that the LC inflammation leaves in your body.  it definitely feels like that for me.  if that kind of fasting is too intense for you though, even 18:6 intermittent fasting does really well for me, so that could be worth a try (but it doesn't produce the same remarkable effects that prolonged fasting has).", "created_utc": "1662344245.0", "edited": "False", "id": "in4ugv0", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_x63la6", "parent_id": "t3_x63la6", "score": "6", "subreddit": "LongCovid", "subreddit_id": "t5_2vw5a0"}, {"author": "ii_akinae_ii", "body": "i pirated it; not sure where else it is available. sorry if that isn't especially helpful \ud83d\ude05", "created_utc": "1662337589.0", "edited": "False", "id": "in4geix", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_x5r12b", "parent_id": "t1_in4doqs", "score": "1", "subreddit": "Psychonaut", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qplv"}, {"author": "ii_akinae_ii", "body": "have you seen the movie 'everything everywhere all at once'?  i recommend it if you haven't.  it is related to your question but i don't really want to explain too much more than that, as i want to avoid spoilers: the movie is soooo damn good.", "created_utc": "1662334518.0", "edited": "False", "id": "in49w2n", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_x5r12b", "parent_id": "t3_x5r12b", "score": "1", "subreddit": "Psychonaut", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qplv"}, {"author": "ii_akinae_ii", "body": "if you really want to get practice, best to use a language group discord.

"it's hard for the folks who are a victim of one particular group of people (such as a certain gender, a certain race, a certain profession), to de-generalize their fears. especially if you're a woman

husband, but because there's some part of you that rationally understands that this is an over-generalization and that it's unhealthy. some doctors are quacks, some are jerks, and some are evil: but some are brilliant, some are kind, and some are deeply empathetic. they're human and they vary: which is why the key lies in finding the good doctors. these days, we have rating apps & websites to help you learn more about a doctor before you ever meet them. everything from google reviews to angie's list to local subreddits where you can ask for recommendations and stories about people's experiences. \n\nwould you be willing to look at these websites, find a good doctor, and do one small checkup, just as practice to see what it's like? you don't need to do anything you don't want to do: heck, you can even turn around and leave after you get to the waiting room if you start to panic. but testing the waters with a very low-stakes appointment, which you can amend or cancel at any time, might help you begin to confront this fear. even if you don't want to get over it, it's unlikely anything horrible could happen from a routine checkup (where they'll listen to your heart & lungs and ask you some questions), especially if your husband is there the whole time. they might want to draw your blood since that's common with routine checkups, but that's probably pretty intense for a first go: you are free to opt out of that. not sure how accessible this would be, but maybe you can even search for a doctor who treats patients with special issues like medical trauma/phobia.\n\n(disclaimer: i am not a doctor or a therapist, only a gal who has her own similar trauma and has tried to work past it with similar techniques. no two people are the same, and i
