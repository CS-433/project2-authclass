This level of trust in another person already makes it extremely intimate.. For me, it's a much gentler and more romantic act than what porn usually portrays, and I get hot from giving the man pleasure.\n\nYou don't have to make him orgasm every single time (especially since you need time to get used to the feeling of having something in your mouth) at first just try making it a part of the foreplay before PIV or another sexual activity. I usually feel more relaxed if I know it's just a part of the foreplay and it's not the main event. \n\nWhat I love about giving oral is that I can do everything in my own pace and tell the man: \"don't move at all, just lie on your back and let me do what I want to do with you.\" \nA good oral by the way doesn't have to be deep, I usually put one hand on the balls (and massage them) and another one on the shaft.. The one on the shaft gives men the feeling like it is fully inside your mouth and you should move it roughly in the same pace as the mouth and also move the wrist in a twisting motion as you go up and down.. \nIf the man is moaning it makes me even hotter and want to continue.. \n\nJust focus on these positive feelings: focus on how enjoyable it is for both of you and on how romantic and sensual it is.", "created_utc": "1664739711.0", "edited": "False", "id": "iqsi0xv", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_xtuxmg", "parent_id": "t3_xtuxmg", "score": "1", "subreddit": "sex", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3p"}, {"author": "Correct-Monk-6761", "body": "I was talking about Corduwener actually..", "created_utc": "1664596112.0", "edited": "False", "id": "iql3mjn", "is_submitter": "True", "link_id": "t3_xr61vj", "parent_id": "t1_iqg3vcb", "score": "1", "subreddit": "unpopularopinion", "subreddit_id": "t5_2tk0s"}, {"author": "Correct-Monk-6761", "body": "\u042f \u043d\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0442\u0438\u0432 \u043f\u043e\u043b\u0438\u0433\u043b\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0432 \u043a\u0430\u043a \u043b\u044e\u0434\u0435\u0439, \u044f \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0442\u0438\u0432 \u0441\u0430\u043c\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0441\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0430 \"\u043f\u043e\u043b\u0438\u0433\u043b\u043e\u0442\" \u043f\u043e\u0442\u043e\u043c\u0443 \u0447\u0442\u043e \u043e\u043d\u043e \u043e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u044c \u0447\u0430\u0441\u0442\u043e \u043f\u0440\u0438\u043c\u0435\u043d\u044f\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u043d\u0435\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0437\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u043d\u044b\u043c\u0438 \u043b\u044e\u0434\u044c\u043c\u0438 \u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0440\u044b\u0435 \u0445\u043e\u0442\u044f\u0442 \u043f\u043e\u0445\u0432\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0442\u044c\u0441\u044f \u043b\u0438\u0431\u043e \u0437\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0430\u0442\u044c.\n\n\u05d0\u05e0\u05d9 \u05e4\u05e9\u05d5\u05d8 \u05d1\u05d0\u05de\u05ea \u05dc\u05d0 \u05e1\u05d5\u05d1\u05dc\u05ea \u05d0\u05ea \u05d4\u05de\u05d9\u05dc\u05d4 \u05d4\u05d6\u05d0\u05ea! \u05d1\u05d9\u05de\u05d9\u05e0\u05d5 \u05db\u05dc \u05d0\u05d7\u05d3 \u05d9\u05db\u05d5\u05dc \u05dc\u05d4\u05e9\u05ea\u05de\u05e9 \u05d1\u05d4 \u05d1\u05dc\u05d9 \u05e7\u05e9\u05e8 \u05dc\u05e8\u05de\u05ea \u05d4\u05d9\u05d3\u05e2 \u05e9\u05dc\u05d5 \u05d5\u05d6\u05d4 \u05de\u05d4 \u05e9\u05de\u05e2\u05e6\u05d1\u05df \u05d0\u05d5\u05ea\u05d9! \u05d0\u05d1\u05dc \u05dc\u05e4\u05d7\u05d5\u05ea \u05d4\u05d7\u05d5\u05dc\u05d9 \u05d4\u05d6\u05d4 \u05dc\u05d0 \u05d4\u05d2\u05d9\u05e2 \u05dc\u05e9\u05e4\u05d4 \u05d4\u05e2\u05d1\u05e8\u05d9\u05ea \u05dc\u05e9\u05de\u05d7\u05ea\u05d9\u05e0\u05d5, \u05d0\u05e0\u05d9 \u05d0\u05e4\u05d9\u05dc\u05d5 \u05dc\u05d0 \u05d1\u05d8\u05d5\u05d7\u05d4 \u05db\u05d9\u05e6\u05d3 \u05dc\u05d5\u05de\u05e8 \u05e4\u05d5\u05dc\u05d9\u05d2\u05dc\u05d5\u05d8 \u05d1\u05e2\u05d1\u05e8\u05d9\u05ea, \u05e8\u05d1 \u05dc\u05e9\u05d5\u05e0\u05d9? \u05e4\u05e9\u05d5\u05d8 \u05d4\u05e0\u05d9\u05d7\u05d5\u05e9 \u05d4\u05d1\u05d0 \u05e9\u05dc\u05d9 \"\u05e8\u05d1-\u05e9\u05e4\u05ea\u05df\" \u05e0\u05e9\u05de\u05e2 \u05dc\u05d9 \u05db\u05de\u05d5 \u05e9\u05dd \u05e9\u05dc \u05de\u05e4\u05dc\u05e6\u05ea \u05e2\u05dd \u05d4\u05de\u05d5\u05df \u05e4\u05d9\u05d5\u05ea \ud83d\ude02.\n\n\u0631\u0627\u0633\u062a\u06cc\u060c \u0647\u0645\u0686\u0646\u06cc\u0646 \u0641\u0627\u0631\u0633\u06cc \u0628\u0644\u062f\u0645 \u0648\u0644\u06cc \u0641\u0627\u0631\u0633\u06cc \u0645\u0646 \u062f\u0627\u063a\u0648\u0646 \u0647\u0633\u062a \u0628\u0647 \u0646\u0638\u0631\u0645. \u0627\u0645\u0627 \u0627\u06cc\u0646 \u0645\u0647\u0645 \u0646\u06cc\u0633\u062a \u0686\u0648\u0646 \u062f\u0627\u0646\u0634\u062c\u0648\u06cc\u0627\u0646 \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0634\u062a\u0628\u0627\u0647\u0627\u062a\u0645 \u0631\u0648 \u0645\u062a\u0648\u062c\u0647 \u0646\u0645\u06cc\u200c\u0634\u0648\u0646\u062f \u0648 \u0641\u06a9\u0631 \u0645\u06cc\u06a9\u0646\u0645 \u06a9\u0647 \u0627\u06af\u0631 \u06f2 \u06a9\u0644\u0645\u0647 \u0628\u06cc\u0634\u062a\u0631 \u0627\u0632 \u062f\u0627\u0646\u0634\u062c\u0648\u06cc\u0627\u0646 \u0628\u062f\u0648\u0646\u0645\u060c \u0627\u06cc\u0646 \u06a9\u0627\u0641\u06cc \u0647\u0633\u062a \ud83d\ude1c (\u0646\u06af\u0631\u0627\u0646 \u0646\u0628\u0627\u0634\u060c \u0634\u0648\u062e\u06cc \u0645\u06cc\u06a9\u0646\u0645).\n\nTo summarize, I know that real polyglots exist, I can't deny my own existence unless we all live in a matrix and then we all don't exist \ud83d\ude02. \nI just hate that this word is more often used by people who want to brag or scam, rather than actual polyglots who are usually more humble.

It's not a problem!\nThink of ice skating , in the beginning you might fall hard on the ice many times before you succeed. \nBut it's not an issue! It's a natural part of the learning experience.

Reading and watching videos or movies is very important in my opinion (choose content that you can actually understand).\nNow, there is no constant time frame to when people stop translating in their head:\nI had a monolingual friend who migrated from Russia to Israel when she was 14 and she struggled with Hebrew a lot and said she stopped translating everything in her head only after 3 years. But once she stopped, I think her Hebrew became much better and now she speaks much faster and more confidently as well.\nNowadays she is learning English and we talked about her tendency to translate everything in her head, with English she said she stopped doing that after about half a year. It definitely shows in my opinion that the brain gets more \"elastic\" after learning your first foreign language.\nConstant exposure to the language will help you to get rid of that habbit of translating everything in your head and will make the grammar sink in more naturally.

Because motivation is pretty important component in language learning.", "created_utc": "1647969066.0", "edited": "False", "id": "i1oms4j", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_t0c1pc", "parent_id": "t3_t0c1pc", "score": "2", "subreddit": "polyglot", "subreddit_id": "t5_2reiv"}, {"author": "Correct-Monk-6761", "body": "\u05d6\u05d4 \u05d1\u05d2\u05dc\u05dc \u05e9\u05d0\u05e0\u05d7\u05e0\u05d5 \u05d2\u05d3\u05dc\u05e0\u05d5 \u05dc\u05ea\u05d5\u05da \u05d4\u05e9\u05e4\u05d4 \u05d4\u05e2\u05d1\u05e8\u05d9\u05ea. \u05d0\u05dd \u05d0\u05ea\u05d4 \u05dc\u05d5\u05de\u05d3 \u05e2\u05d1\u05e8\u05d9\u05ea \u05d1\u05ea\u05d5\u05e8 \u05e9\u05e4\u05d4 \u05d6\u05e8\u05d4 \u05d6\u05d4 \u05de\u05de\u05e9 \u05dc\u05d0 \u05d0\u05d9\u05e0\u05d8\u05d5\u05d0\u05d9\u05d8\u05d9\u05d1\u05d9. \u05dc\u05d3\u05d5\u05d2\u05de\u05d0 \u05d1\u05e6\u05e8\u05e4\u05ea\u05d9\u05ea \u05d5\u05d2\u05dd \u05d1\u05e8\u05d5\u05e1\u05d9\u05ea \u05d4\u05de\u05d9\u05dc\u05d4 \u05dc\u05d2'\u05d9\u05e8\u05e4\u05d4 \u05d4\u05d9\u05d0 \u05db\u05de\u05e2\u05d8 \u05d6\u05d4\u05d4 \u05d0\u05d1\u05dc \u05d1\u05e8\u05d5\u05e1\u05d9\u05ea \u05d6\u05d4 \u05d6\u05db\u05e8 \u05d5\u05d1\u05e6\u05e8\u05e4\u05ea\u05d9\u05ea \u05d6\u05d4 \u05e0\u05e7\u05d1\u05d4.\n\n\u05d5\u05d4\u05d3\u05e8\u05da \u05d4\u05d9\u05d7\u05d9\u05d3\u05d4 \u05dc\u05d3\u05e2\u05ea \u05d0\u05ea \u05d4\u05d3\u05d1\u05e8\u05d9\u05dd \u05d4\u05dc\u05dc\u05d5 \u05d1\u05d0\u05d5\u05e4\u05df \u05d0\u05d9\u05e0\u05d8\u05d5\u05d0\u05d9\u05d8\u05d9\u05d1\u05d9 \u05d6\u05d4 \u05d3\u05e8\u05da \u05d7\u05e9\u05d9\u05e4\u05d4 \u05de\u05de\u05d5\u05e9\u05db\u05ea \u05dc\u05e9\u05e4\u05d4", "created_utc": "1647958690.0", "edited": "False", "id": "i1nwhpy", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_tjl5ij", "parent_id": "t3_tjl5ij", "score": "1", "subreddit": "hebrew", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rk3f"}, {"author": "Correct-Monk-6761", "body": "I would say khool in general when talking about traveling abroad, it is just shortened from khutz laaretz:\n\u05d7\u05d6\u05e8\u05ea\u05d9 \u05de\u05d7\u05d5\"\u05dc \nKhazarti mekhool = I came back from abroad.\nEretz is a country in general but when you say laaretz or haaretz it kinda means: of this country, and we usually refer to Israel when we say haaretz.
