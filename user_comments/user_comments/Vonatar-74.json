If they had trusted the source material you would have almost none of these questions and Amazon would still have had a show that presented diversity and strong female characters.\n\nJust to give you an example, the end of the Eye of the World book is an epic moment where Rand channels for the first time without knowing what he\u2019s doing and the destruction of the Trolloc army is his doing, channelling immense power. It\u2019s a moment where both Rand and the reader see the power of the Dragon and how terrifying it can be and why the Dragon is to be feared.\n\nNow the showrunner commented that this ending is criticised (don\u2019t know where he got that from) so he wanted to change it and give the moment to Egwene and Nynaeve to show their potential with the One Power.\n\nIt\u2019s an example of the showrunner\u2019s approach to the show - he wants to tell a different story and he doesn\u2019t care about trashing the source material and creating inconsistencies and plot holes. The ending of Episode 8 was my highest point of disappointment and anger with the show because it robbed us of what is a great conclusion in the book and what really sets up what is to come.

It contained a pool of pure untainted saidin for the Dragon to use without being affected by madness, as well as the banner of the previous Dragon and the Horn of Valere. Therefore it\u2019s Rand\u2019s destiny to go there on his path to becoming the Dragon Reborn. The Dragon Banner and the Horn of Valere become significant later. The Horn was not buried under Lord Agelmar\u2019s throne and was not taken by Padan Fain until later in the story. \n\nThe guy Rand \u201cfights\u201d at the Eye of the World is Ishmael (according to X-Ray), one of the Forsaken - channellers from 3000 years ago who serve the Dark One and were sealed away but are beginning to break free. In the book, Ishmael has been hunting Rand in his dreams but doesn\u2019t appear at the Eye of the World. Instead it\u2019s two other Forsaken who come to fight Rand.

In most aristocratic families someone \u201cgot lucky\u201d probably hundreds of years earlier by being granted a title and lands by the king. And thereby creating more wealth by owning and managing those lands (taxes, rents, farming etc.). The wealth that you see in Downton in the early 20th century would have derived from that originally. \n\nBut as you already see in S1 the wealth of not only the Crawleys but other aristocratic families is declining. A large part of that was due to an unwillingness to change or adapt. Or to really understand how to make money from their estates. Education of the lower class was increasing and many didn\u2019t want to be tenant farmers like their fathers and grandfathers before them. Hence families (like Robert) married in \u201cdollar princesses\u201d who brought money from America to prop up their ailing estates. The show covers this all quite well, along with Robert\u2019s inability to manage his estate and his money well. \n\nThen you have the destruction of the aristocracy via inheritance tax (\u201cdeath duties\u201d) which basically crippled them financially and forced them to sell off all or part of their estates to pay inheritance tax. These started at 8% but by 1919 were up to 40%. That\u2019s why many former noble seats are in the hands of the National Trust and many aristocratic families today are \u201clandless\u201d.\n\nIt\u2019s actually interesting that the show brought a lot of money to Highclere House (the location) allowing the Earl of Caernarvon who owns it to invest it into his estate.
