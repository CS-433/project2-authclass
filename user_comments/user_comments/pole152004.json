Still, the American labor market remains strong, and the economy is moving forward.  \nChina, a powerful engine of global growth and a major market for European exports like cars, machinery and food, is facing its own set of problems. Beijing\u2019s policy of continuing to freeze all activity during Covid-19 outbreaks has repeatedly paralyzed large swaths of the economy and added to worldwide supply chain disruptions. In the last few weeks alone, dozens of cities and more than 300 million people have been under full or partial lockdowns. Extreme heat and drought have hamstrung hydropower generation, forcing additional factory closings and rolling blackouts.  \nA troubled real estate market has added to the economic instability in China. Hundreds of thousands of people are refusing to pay their mortgages because they have lost confidence that developers will ever deliver their unfinished housing units. Trade with the rest of the world took a hit in August, and overall economic growth, although likely to outrun rates in the United States and Europe, looks as if it will slip to its slowest pace in a decade this year. The prospect has prompted China\u2019s central bank to cut interest rates in hopes of stimulating the economy.  \n\u201cThe global economy is undoubtedly slowing,\u201d said Gregory Daco, chief economist at the global consulting firm EY- Parthenon, but it\u2019s \u201chappening at different speeds.\u201d  \nIn other parts of the world, countries that are able to supply vital materials and goods \u2014 particularly energy producers in the Middle East and North Africa \u2014 are seeing windfall gains.  \nAnd India and Indonesia are growing at unexpectedly fast paces as domestic demand increases and multinational companies look to vary their supply chains. Vietnam, too, is benefiting as manufacturers switch operations to its shores.  \n\n\nEven so, China, the eurozone and the United States together account for roughly two-thirds of the planet\u2019s economic activity, and if those powerhouses all slow down, it will be hard for any country to remain insulated from the fallout.  \nPoorer people, who spend much more of their total incomes on food and energy, are being hit hardest.  \nIn Europe, anxiety about frigid living rooms, shuttered production lines and head-spinning energy bills this winter ratcheted up this week after Gazprom, Russia\u2019s state-owned energy company, declared it would not resume the flow of natural gas through its Nord Stream 1 pipeline until Europe lifted Ukraine-related sanctions.  \n\n\nDaily average electricity prices in Western Europe have reached record levels, according to Rystad Energy, surging past 600 euros ($599) per megawatt-hour in Germany and \u20ac700 in France, with peak-hour rates as high as \u20ac1,500.  \nIn the Czech Republic, roughly 70,000 angry protesters, many with links to far-right groups, gathered in Wenceslas Square in Prague this past weekend to demonstrate against soaring energy bills.  \nThe German, French and Finnish governments have already stepped in to save domestic power companies from bankruptcy. Even so, Uniper, which is based in Germany and one of Europe\u2019s largest natural gas buyers and suppliers, said last week that it was losing more than \u20ac100 million a day because of the rise in prices.\n\nThe European Commission, which has scheduled an emergency meeting of energy ministers for Friday, is calling for a cap on wholesale gas prices and an overhaul of how electricity is priced. And in recent days, Germany, Sweden, France and Britain all announced sweeping billion-dollar relief programs to ease the strain on households and businesses, along with rationing and conservation plans.  \nThe cost of all these measures would be enormous, at a time when government debt levels are already staggering. The worry about perilously high debt prompted the International Monetary Fund this week to issue a proposal to reform the European Union\u2019s framework for government public spending and deficits.  \nStill, a pitiless and unyielding reality remains: a lack of energy that countries can afford.  \nAt current prices, there is simply not enough to produce the steel, lumber, microchips, glass, cotton, plastic, chemicals and electricity that go into making the food, home heat, garage doors, tampons, bicycles, baby formula, wine glasses and more that consumers want.  \nThe root of the shortage predates the Ukraine war.  \nCommodity prices started rising in 2020 as countries began emerging from pandemic restrictions, noted Sven Smit, a senior partner at the consulting firm McKinsey & Company. In the United States alone, consumers were, in effect, buying $1 trillion more goods than expected, based on spending patterns before coronavirus hit.  \nAnd the sudden switch in spending on products like new kitchen tiles and cars rather than services like restaurant dining and entertainment added to the problem because more energy and materials are needed to make them.  \nThere is a \u201cdepleted supply chain,\u201d more than a broken one, Mr. Smit said. \u201cThis is a physical crisis rather than a psychological crisis,\u201d which is different from those that most people remember.  \nIn the past, \u201cyou got scared of something, you stopped spending, and then you got more comfortable and spending came back,\u201d Mr. Smit said. \u201cThat\u2019s not what\u2019s happening right now. To solve this puzzle, we have to restore supply.\u201d  \nThat puzzle is complicated by the need to produce energy that not only is quickly available and affordable, but also won\u2019t aggravate the calamitous climate change already endangering the planet.\n\nAchieving that goal will take years, rather than months.  \nIn the short term, a limit on energy prices could offer struggling households and businesses relief, but economists are concerned that caps blunt the incentive to reduce energy consumption \u2014 the chief goal in a world of shortages.  \nCentral banks in the West are expected to keep raising interest rates to make borrowing more expensive and force down inflation. On Thursday, the European Central Bank raised interest rates by three-quarters of a point, matching its biggest increase ever. The U.S. Federal Reserve is likely to do the same when it meets this month. The Bank of England has taken a similar position.  \nThe worry is that the vigorous push to bring down prices will plunge economies into recessions. Higher interest rates alone won\u2019t bring down the price of oil and gas \u2014 except by crashing economies so much that demand is severely reduced. Many analysts are already predicting a recession in Germany, Italy and the rest of the eurozone before the end of the year. For poor and emerging countries, higher interest rates mean more debt and less money to spend on the most vulnerable.  \n\u201cI think we\u2019re living through the biggest development disaster in history, with more people being pushed more quickly into dire poverty than has every happened before,\u201d said Mr. Goldin, the Oxford professor. \u201cIt\u2019s a particularly perilous time for the world economy.\u201d", "created_utc": "1662646658.0", "edited": "False", "id": "inlb01b", "is_submitter": "True", "link_id": "t3_x91mye", "parent_id": "t1_inlaqrp", "score": "1", "subreddit": "europe", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh4j"}, {"author": "pole152004", "body": "Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine and the continuing effects of the pandemic have hobbled countries around the globe, but the relentless series of crises has hit Europe the hardest, causing the steepest jump in energy prices, some of the highest inflation rates and the biggest risk of recession.  \nThe fallout from the war is menacing the continent with what some fear could become its most challenging economic and financial crisis in decades.  \nWhile growth is slowing worldwide, \u201cin Europe it\u2019s altogether more serious because it\u2019s driven by a more fundamental deterioration,\u201d said Neil Shearing, group chief economist at Capital Economics. Real incomes and living standards are falling, he added. \u201cEurope and Britain are just worse off.\u201d  \nSeveral countries, including Germany, the region\u2019s largest economy, built up a decades-long dependence on Russian energy. The eightfold increase in natural gas prices since the war began presents a historic threat to Europe\u2019s industrial might, living standards, and social peace and cohesion. Plans for factory closings, rolling blackouts and rationing are being drawn up in case of severe shortages this winter.  \nThe risk of sinking incomes, growing inequality and rising social tensions could lead \u201cnot only to a fractured society but a fractured world,\u201d said Ian Goldin, a professor of globalization and development at Oxford University. \u201cWe haven\u2019t faced anything like this since the 1970s, and it\u2019s not ending soon.\u201d  \nOther regions of the world are also being squeezed, although some of the causes \u2014 and prospects \u2014 differ.", "created_utc": "1662646550.0", "edited": "False", "id": "inlaqrp", "is_submitter": "True", "link_id": "t3_x91mye", "parent_id": "t3_x91mye", "score": "3", "subreddit": "europe", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh4j"}, {"author": "pole152004", "body": "All this week the NYT headlines have been about Europe and how its going to pretty much collapse, though this seems to happen every couple years when a crisis hits Europe, so i feel like its just american news media sensationalism", "created_utc": "1662643322.0", "edited": "False", "id": "inl39uy", "is_submitter": "True", "link_id": "t3_x90drs", "parent_id": "t3_x90drs", "score": "9", "subreddit": "europe", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh4j"}, {"author": "pole152004", "body": "1.Dark Side\n\n2.

They spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the news media.\n\nCopelouzos Group is privately held and does not make public its financial performance but says that its joint venture with Gazprom represents a tiny share of its business portfolio, which spans construction, real estate and energy.\n\n\u201cThe group has many cooperations across the world with many companies,\u201d said Ioannis Arapoglou, the Copelouzos Group\u2019s general manager. Prometheus Gas \u201cis just one of those, and a relatively small one for the size of the company.\u201d\n\nHe noted that the Copelouzos family is investing  in a project to build a liquid natural gas terminal near Alexandroupoli, meant to reduce Balkan reliance on Russian gas by bolstering supplies from the United States. For his part, Mr. Charalambakis, the American businessman, says his interest in the port began in 2018, when Washington\u2019s ambassador to Greece at the time, Geoffrey Pyatt, told him American companies needed to start competing with Russia and China for influence there.\n\nWashington\u2019s growing attention was highlighted on Wednesday, when Senator Robert Menendez of New Jersey, chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, made a surprise visit to Alexandroupoli.\n\nGreece has been steadily privatizing strategic assets since its debt crisis begun in 2009. The Thessaloniki port went to Mr. Savvidis; the port of Piraeus, Greece\u2019s largest, to a Chinese state-owned firm.\n\nMr. Pyatt, who left the post in May, has spoken out frequently in support of the two American bids for Alexandroupoli.\n\nThe other American bidder, Quintana Infrastructure & Development, declined to comment.\n\nThe Copelouzos Group\u2019s shift toward American partners mirrors Greece\u2019s changing economic reality, as the sanctioned and shrinking Russian economy supplies fewer opportunities.\n\nThis pragmatic approach is echoed in Alexandroupoli. Local officials and businessmen hope the war in Ukraine and regional tensions will transform the port into an alternative supply route that bypasses the Turkish-controlled straits to the Black Sea.\n\n\u201cEvery crisis creates opportunities,\u201d said Konstantinos Chatzikonstantinou, the chief executive of the Alexandroupoli Port Authority.", "created_utc": "1660838838.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ikt7s91", "is_submitter": "True", "link_id": "t3_wrn87l", "parent_id": "t1_ikt7rj8", "score": "1", "subreddit": "europe", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh4j"}, {"author": "pole152004", "body": "\nIn May, the Greek Foreign Ministry claimed Turkish fighter jets violated the country\u2019s air space over Alexandroupoli, just 11 miles from the Turkish border. The incident unnerved local residents concerned with Turkey\u2019s claims to parts of Greece.\n\nThe complex interplay of interests at Alexandroupoli highlights how the war is shifting the strategic focus of Europe to the Black Sea region.\n\n\u201cThe Black Sea is back on the global agenda in an unprecedented way,\u201d said Ilian Vassilev, a former Bulgarian ambassador to Moscow who now works as a strategic consultant. \u201cSecurity in the Black Sea is central to the issue of how you contain and deal with Russia.\u201d\n\nGreece and Russia share deep historical, economic and cultural ties centered on the common Orthodox Christian religion. Greeks are among the few Europeans who largely want to maintain economic ties to Russia, polls show. But the war in Ukraine has badly strained those bonds.\n\nThe occupation of Ukrainian lands has struck a chord among Greeks, many of whom see parallels between the imperial rhetoric of President Vladimir V. Putin and the territorial claims of Turkey, whose predecessor, the Ottoman Empire, ruled Greece for centuries. The plight of Ukrainians has also resonated with Greek families whose ancestors fled Turkish pogroms in the early 20th century.\n\n\u201cWe know about the pain of refugees,\u201d said Dimosthenis Karavoltsos, an Alexandroupoli taverna waiter. \u201cThere was no question in my mind about what side we should be on.\u201d\n\nGreece\u2019s conservative government was one of the first to send military aid to Ukraine, prompting the Kremlin to put it on the list of \u201cunfriendly\u201d nations. Fear of Turkey and solidarity with Ukraine have pushed Athens closer to Washington, and it has granted the United States expanded military access in several locations.\n\nThe amount of war mat\u00e9riel moved by the United States through Alexandroupoli jumped nearly 14-fold last year \u2014 before the war, but as tensions with Russia mounted \u2014 to 3,100 \u201cpieces,\u201d a catchall term used by the Pentagon for all sorts of equipment from tanks to ammunition. It has already matched that figure this year.\n\nThe jump in activity is a drastic turnaround for a minor port that stood largely idle for almost a decade, blocked by a sunken barge that the U.S. Navy removed in 2019.\n\nThe town\u2019s languid mood is transformed every few months when U.S. warships dock to unload tanks, trucks and artillery. The arrival of hundreds of Americans prompts periodic shortages of eggs and cigarettes, and lines outside tattoo parlors.\n\nBetween those bursts of activity, few signs pointed to the city\u2019s new importance. On the beach promenade near the port, couples push strollers, and day trippers, mostly from Turkey, snap selfies under the city\u2019s lighthouse. Civilian shipping remains minimal because of the lack of large cranes, but the Pentagon is installing heavy equipment to handle more cargo.\n\n\u201cWhat we have done is transform the port into a dynamic military operations hub,\u201d said Andre Cameron, who oversees U.S. military logistics at the port. \u201cNothing like it has been done here before.\u201d\n\nLocal officials said they hoped the military upgrades at the port would attract investments in other industries, turning Alexandroupoli into a trade hub for nearby Bulgaria, Romania and even blockaded Ukraine.\n\nThe port\u2019s growing strategic importance has highlighted the Russian ties of two Greek business groups competing to take it over.\n\nOne group is led by Ivan Savvidis, a Russian-Greek oligarch who has served in the Russian Parliament and sits on a foreign relations committee advising Mr. Putin. \u201cGreek by birth, Russian by lifestyle, Orthodox by faith,\u201d says a statement on Mr. Savvidis\u2019s website, which features a photo of him with Mr. Putin.\n\nMr. Savvidis\u2019s bid may be complicated by his ownership of the port of Thessaloniki, Greece\u2019s second largest, which could run afoul of competition laws. His spokesperson declined to comment.\n\nAnother bidder, a subsidiary of a Greek conglomerate, Copelouzos Group, is more complex, highlighting Greece\u2019s shifting economic ties.\n\nCopelouzos is the local partner of state-owned Russian gas company, Gazprom, and, in a joint venture called Prometheus Gas, is Greece\u2019s third-largest supplier of natural gas. Copelouzos Group built \u2014 and, until 2016, operated \u2014 the airport of St. Petersburg.\n\nA diplomatic memo on the group\u2019s founder, Dimitrios Copelouzos, written by the American ambassador to Greece in 2007 and published by WikiLeaks is titled \u201cGazprom by any other name?\u201d\n\nMr. Copelouzos\u2019s competitors and detractors claim that these ties make him vulnerable to pressure from Gazprom, compromising the future of Alexandroupoli\u2019s strategic operations.\n\n\u201cThere are significant concerns because the situation with Russia can deteriorate,\u201d said John Charalambakis, an owner of BlackSummit Financial Group, an American asset management firm that is competing for control of Alexandroupoli. \u201cThe fact that Russia is using energy as a weapon is an important factor.\u201d", "created_utc": "1660838830.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ikt7rj8", "is_submitter": "True", "link_id": "t3_wrn87l", "parent_id": "t1_ikt7p9p", "score": "1", "subreddit": "europe", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh4j"}, {"author": "pole152004", "body": "Full article\n\nThe flow of U.S. military supplies through Alexandroupoli has angered Russia and Turkey. Now, firms with ties to Russia and America are competing for control of the port.\n\nALEXANDROUPOLI, Greece \u2014 It is an unlikely geopolitical flash-point: a concrete pier in a little coastal city, barely used a few years ago and still occupied only by sea gulls most of the time.\n\nBut the sleepy port of Alexandroupoli in northeastern Greece has taken on a central role in increasing the U.S. military presence in Eastern Europe, with the Pentagon transporting enormous arsenals through here in what it describes as the effort to contain Russian aggression. That flow has angered not only Russia but also neighboring Turkey, underlining how war in Ukraine is reshaping Europe\u2019s economic and diplomatic relationships.\n\nTurkey and Greece are both NATO members, but there is longstanding animosity between them, including conflict over Cyprus and other territorial disputes in the Mediterranean, and Ankara sees a deeper relationship between Athens and Washington as a potential threat.\n\nThe spike in military activity has been welcomed by the government of Greece, most of its Balkan neighbors and local residents, who hope that Americans will stimulate the regional economy and provide security amid rising regional tensions.\n\nWe\u2019re a small country,\u201d said Yiannis Kapelas, 53, an Alexandroupoli cafe owner. \u201cIt\u2019s a good thing to have a big country to protect us.\u201d\n\nRaising the strategic stakes is the impending sale of the Alexandroupoli port.
