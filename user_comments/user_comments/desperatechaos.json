You need to start with the base form of verbs and then for each conjugation or grammar pattern learn how they're applied.\n\nIn order of the examples you listed:\n\n1. (\uc544/\uc5b4/\uc5ec)\uc8fc\ub2e4 is the grammar pattern here. So combined with \ubcf4\ub2e4 you can \ubd10 \uc8fc\ub2e4. Then add the honorific \uc2dc suffix to get \ubd10 \uc8fc\uc2dc\ub2e4 -> \ubd10 \uc8fc\uc138\uc694.\n1. (\uc544/\uc5b4/\uc5ec)\ub3c4 is the grammar pattern. When used with \ub9d0\ud574 \uc8fc\ub2e4 you get \ub9d0\ud574 \uc918\ub3c4. \n1. (\uc544/\uc5b4/\uc5ec)\uc11c is the grammar pattern, here combined with \uc774\ub2e4 which gives you \uc774\uc5b4\uc11c. \n1. (\uc73c)\ub85c is the grammar pattern. \ubd80\ud0c1\ub4dc\ub9ac\ub2e4 is the base form of the verb so you don't need to add anything, just conjugate it into \ubd80\ud0c1\ub4dc\ub9bd\ub2c8\ub2e4. Note \ubd80\ud0c1 by itself is NOT a verb but a noun.\n1. (\uc73c)\ub2c8\uae4c is the grammar pattern here.\n1. (\uc73c)\ub824\ub098 is the grammar pattern here.\n1. (\uc73c)\uba74 is the grammar pattern here.\n\nThinking about it as \"verbs-to-verbs\" is not really the correct way to go about it, because that's not the reason why certain things conjugate in certain ways. I would also advise against thinking of these things like \uc73c or \uc544/\uc5b4/\uc5ec as things \"joining\" verbs or whatever. They're not joining things but are part of the grammar pattern or conjugation itself. I guess to answer your question directly, there's no general rule as far as I can think of. You just have to learn how each grammar pattern works and practice making sentences with them until they become habitual.", "created_utc": "1642355933.0", "edited": "1642376566.0", "id": "hsxd8f9", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_s59zxb", "parent_id": "t3_s59zxb", "score": "12", "subreddit": "Korean", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rd8q"}, {"author": "desperatechaos", "body": "Koreans put their spring onions in first with oil to make \ud30c\uae30\ub984 or spring onion oil before putting in ingredients for the rest of the dish.

So as you can see \uc740/\ub294 has a feeling of comparing to other things (whether explicitly stated or not). This is why often it's translated as \"as for.\"\n\nIf someone asked you \uc5ec\uae30 \ubb50\uac00 \ub9db\uc788\uc5b4? You can say \ucee4\ud53c\uac00 \ub9db\uc788\uc5b4 to emphasize that it is the coffee that is delicious. Note how there's more focus on the subject here rather than the \"is delicious\" part. What's delicious? The coffee is. Similarly, if someone asks \uc774\uac70 \ub204\uac00 \ud588\uc5b4? you can respond with \ub0b4\uac00 \ud588\uc5b4 (I am the one who did it). \ub098\ub294 \ud588\uc5b4 would sound really weird here. \n\nIf you have some examples of when you got it wrong I can try to explain why you might want the other particle in that context.\n\nLastly, I don't think it's worth obsessing too much about the rules and to focus on mass input to get the hang of these.

Of course this can change with the new variant, but your statement that almost everyone will be infected by the time it's widely given is straight up false.\n\nSo the fact that more people will be sick by the time vaccines are widely available = the vaccine doesn't work? Your logic makes no sense. In that case we might as well give up on trying to find treatments or prevention measures for anything because more people will always get sick before these discoveries can be made and rolled out.\n\nYou're also not \"reasoning what's going to happen.\" You're literally stating a falsehood that the vaccine doesn't work based on the fact that 1) we haven't confirmed it stops transmission yet and 2) more people will be sick by the time it's widely given.

Nowhere does it say the virus is still being transmitted after vaccination. Your own article says there isn't enough data about it so to be safe they're assuming that it's still possible to shed virus even if you have the antibody. One last time because your reading comprehension is shit: not having enough data to rule out transmission after vaccination is NOT the same as definitively saying that it does happen. \n\n\nI also said 6-7 million new cases, not 48 million. At this point I just have to assume you're either stupid or purposefully misquoting me. \n\n\nThe case rate is not increasing exponentially right now. Go look at a graph of the new cases per day, and you'll see it's leveled off recently at around 200k. In fact, assuming 200k new cases per day will continue into summer is not realistic because, as we've seen, infection happens in waves that peak and then decline. However even with this unrealistically high assumed case rate, we still end up with 7 million new cases by August.\n\nI'm not getting the vaccine at the moment, but I will someday later next year. The fact that I haven't got it yet doesn't mean I won't get it later. How is this relevant at all to whether or not the vaccine works? They will make the vaccine available to everyone later this year. They're just prioritizing certain populations right now. \n\nJust because the possibility of mutation exists doesn't mean it will mutate to make the virus ineffective. Yes there is a new strain discovered recently, but the vaccine is still most likely effective against that because the mutation did not affect the things the immune system recognize and target.

This is already a big win and will go a long way towards reducing the burden of disease as well as spread of the disease. Fewer infected people, less virus being produced by these sick people, less potential for spread. Make sense? \n\n2) We don't have much data on how well the approved vaccines reduce transmission because that data was not considered one of the primary data endpoints of the studies. But that's what they're trying to find out now with further studies. \"We don't know\" is not the same as \"we know it doesn't work.\" But then again you've shown time and time again you don't know understand science or nuances. \n\n3) Experts have estimated we may be able to have vaccinated enough people to achieve herd immunity by summer. Now I don't know how many people will be sick by then, but I can guarantee you that even epidemiologists and stasticians say their best predictions can be wrong. But somehow you seem to know something these experts don't. In fact, even if we do some simple arithmetic and assume that the current 200000 new cases/day stays the same until August, that's still about 6-7 million new cases.
