It is incredibly common to hear/another community speaks it very close nearby/can be used very easily. This is why Spanish is so popular in the US. Most Americans won't spend a ton of time learning a language they can't easily access, even if it's spoken widely far away.\n2. The language is used in a rich place. A lot of times this means financially, but also (according to whatever stereotypes present in someone's head) culture richness. This is why French/German are also studied often.\n3. There is some political/cultural trend. This is Mandarin and Korean nowadays. It was Arabic from some time during some wars in the middle east. Before that it was Russian.\n\nHindi doesn't really have any of this going for it. It is a very commonly spoken language, but not even all Indian immigrants to the U.S speak Hindi and not some other Indian language. India is not yet a very rich country and bollywood is not as powerful as k-pop in its trendsetting abilities (currently). Trends might change though. Just look at China or Japan.\n\nHonestly you can switch the language in most of your sentences and you'll realize it pretty well. Why don't people learn Arabic, or Turkish, or Polish, or Creole? I think the best comparison is \"why don't people learn Bengali?\" It just isn't viewed as usable, or applicable, or  cool. That's just how it is right now.

If you are solving at 2 minutes that means you are averaging one turn every 2 seconds, and since you should be executing cmll relatively fast it\u2019s probably slower than that for most of the solve. I don\u2019t say this to criticize but just for information. Try doing a couple solves and counting how many moves your solves are to see if this is a major problem or not (don\u2019t worry if it\u2019s like 75 but if it\u2019s much more you probably don\u2019t know how to do one of steps correctly and should rewatch a guide)\n\nThis means either you are wasting a lot of moves  that don\u2019t do anything/being really inefficient or you are pausing a lot. \n\nWhen I started out with roux pausing was my huge issue. You have to learn how to look around the cube and simply find the pieces you want. Around your speed you probably can literally look at every piece you haven\u2019t solved yet (so especially during second block or the end of first block) and think \u201cis this piece useful. If yes solve it/find the other piece that goes with it and pair, if no move on and don\u2019t look at it again\u201d I think finding edges in general are easier than corners also to help your searching problem. Also for color neutral solving you do not need to memorize which colors go in the front and back of your blocks. Look at the centers during inspection. Even world class people like Feliks do this.\n\nSpecific steps tips:\nWatch this video for understand how first block is fundamentally built and understand the 2/3 general approaches (Square + Pair, Dl edge + 2 pairs, Line block)\nhttps://youtu.be/0Cq3YDud1dA\n\nSecond block make sure you understand how to pair pieces using the m slice, and all the pair insertions without rotations. Never rotate.\n\nCmll is just 2 look. Try to learn proper finger tricks here\n\nLSE: learn how it works intuitively. How things like M\u2019 U2 M flip the front 2 pieces, how you can set up to arrow cases, doing M\u2019 E2 M E2 for dots and M2 U2 M2 U2 for bars in 4c, recognition of good and bad edges (make sure you have the right center up every time!) You don\u2019t really need a complex recognition method for 4c like dfdb. That allows you to know the optimal way to solve every time but as long as your are trying to match pieces (the right solutions tend to make bars and lines that you don\u2019t break) you will probably be close to the optimal solution anyway.\n\n\nHope this helps!!!", "created_utc": "1655923616.0", "edited": "False", "id": "idc4gxg", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_vhwzx1", "parent_id": "t1_ida0d3g", "score": "1", "subreddit": "Cubers", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r6a3"}, {"author": "Cooliceage", "body": "Metronome practice isn\u2019t that useful, but general consensus is to turn more smoothly rather than spamming.

It\u2019s a very direct and concrete way to improve, and it just helps with the flow of your solve in general.

I\u2019ve put beginner tutorials for both below and am overall description of both.\n\nCFOP is quite linear. You solve a cross on the bottom, the insert corner edge pairs into the 4 slots on the cube. Then you solve the final layer using algorithms (for beginner there\u2019s 4, intermediate there\u2019s 13, advanced around 70, world class hundreds). It\u2019s pretty straightforward overall.

Roux has tons of creativity, so it can be difficult to master (though I don\u2019t think it\u2019s harder to improve at) movecount is around 48-52 if done well, uses mostly R, U and M moves except for first block which uses everything.

So this would actually be really interesting to find out. \n\n\nHe did collaborate with the Nazis irl, mostly to protect his family and because he couldn\u2019t leave to the Americas, so he was actually backed by Germany in events and represented them, even though he was Russian. He died in Portugal, but no one is 100% confident how he died. It could have been a heart attack or choking on meat, but there are theories he was assassinated by the Soviets for being a collaborator as well so there\u2019s actually a couple of options I think.\n\nIf you think he was actually assassinated then in TNO he would probably live and continue to play. He was already declining in strength at that point, so likely he would have been challenged by some of the strong German players and Soviet players in Nazi occupied zones (they were allowed to play actually) and lost the championship. There were a lot of famous players affected by ww2 in weird ways (google najdorf for an interesting one) so I dunno who.\n\nIf you think he died naturally then there would probably be a tournament organized to decide the WC like otl, and a European player would likely win, but there would probably be a ton of politics since a lot of high level players tried to flee Germany or were russian.\n\nI\u2019m not confident that chess wouldn\u2019t be Russian anymore. Most famous Russian chess players were from the West of Russia or one of the SSRs (Tal was Latvian, Petrosian Armenian). The one largest difference is that Botvinnik would not have the influence he did. He founded the Russian chess school and coached the team that helped make Russia the greatest in the world, and without him I\u2019m not sure. He also was a big computer scientist so it would be unfortunate if he wasn\u2019t alive.\n\nAlso Japan has a different variant of chess called Shogi.

To be honest i kinda disagree with your first point. This game is definitely still very easy to just pick up and play.  After  watching ctwc for around a year or so I decided to just pick it up during quarantine. A couple months later I'm in the main event. The main reason for this is hypertapping, because learning to play das on 19 takes a long time while tapping gives nearly everyone an easy ability to just improve very quickly. There's a reason nearly everyone in the event were newcomers, it's because tapping allows anyone an ability to get really good at this game pretty fast.\n\n2. We'll see how the new champion takes up the mantel tbh. I think Joseph was honestly an amazing head of the community and dog could be as well. It will definitely be different, because of age as well as other factors, but I'm sure it will be alright.\n\n3. Don't be worried about this type of stuff happening in the tetris community. A huge amount of the players are extremely close friends and, from talking to them, the fame hasn't gone to their heads.

Mountain of text incoming, because this is pretty specific knowledge.\n\nFirst controllers. If when you say \"original Nintendo hardware\" then you mean everything is from 1985 then I can't exactly say yes. A lot of players replace certain parts of their controllers when they break, such as the dpads. It's functionally the exact same, but not everything is super old. I don't think supply issues are going to be a concern since most things are very cheap, and assembling a nes controller is very easy. I can't tell you the exact difficulty in getting this stuff since my controller came with the nes I bought on ebay, and I haven't needed to replace anything. People also do mod their controllers and that is allowed, as long as you don't change the functionality. I've linked examples at the bottom.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe goofy foot controller has a unique story. If you don't want the story just skip the next paragraph. In sum the goofyfoot is the mega super exception only because it has been tested and is nearly identical to the original, and is made by a guy who is one of the organizers.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo the goofy foot is, as you said, not original in the sense that it was not released back in the 80s. It was made I believe in the early 2010s? I can't tell you that for sure. So here's the story. So there's Steve, who's amazing btw, and he is super smart. He has been going to the tournaments forever, and he wants to improve the experience. He decides to make a nes controller that switches the sides of the dpad and the buttons, but he tries to make it as faithful as the original. It is nearly identical to the original, except for the sides being switched. Now Steve is also one of the judges for ctwc, and is well known also for being the guy that Quaid plays with when he streams or plays online. If you watched the ctwc videos with Quaid this year the guy that Quaid is high-fiving is Steve. So Steve is a guy with credit in the community, he makes a controller that is tested by tons of players and after that much work they decide collectively it's such a good clone that you are allowed to use it for ctwc tournaments. The major reason they decide that is because it uses the same parts as an original, except for the circuit board. Same shape, same buttons, same pads, same case. You can actually just buy the board off him and you can solder your original controller into a goofyfoot. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nOther clone controllers are not allowed because they often are not close enough to the original. I don't mean in parts, I mean in design. If the shape is different, or the buttons are in different spots, or anything else it is too different then it isn't allowed. In sum the organizers care about functionality, and not age or other stuff like that. Visual mods, and part switching is allowed, because the game is still the same.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOk clone consoles. First the organizers originally did not allow any clone consoles. They tested a ton of them a couple of months ago, and only allowed the Retron, so there must be a reason. I've linked an interview with the organizers at the bottom for more info on the topic. From what I have heard the Retron is the most faithful to the nes, and might be the only clone with absolutely no input delay, because I have heard the retro bit might have some lag. I can't tell you the exact reasons for which was allowed or not. It might have to do with the few top players that use clone consoles, like dog, using retron. From personal experience in terms of gameplay the nes and retron is the same, except for the slight decrease in audio quality and some color palette changes. I played in ctwc this year in the gold bracket with a retron and it worked well, so I can assure you it was all good. I know this isn't the most satisfactory answer, but I hope that I answered your question\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHope this was helpful, even if it was super long. Good luck with everything!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https://www.instagram.com/arbitriumcontrollers/?hl=en](https://www.instagram.com/arbitriumcontrollers/?hl=en) \\- visual mods for nes controllers that are allowed.

Thor was left handed and held the controller normally so no one could really copy his technique. No innovation happened with hypertapping until Koryan.\n\nKoryan had a very different grip than every other hypertapper and he was the guy that popularized the method. Joseph was directly inspired by Koryan, and uses a variant of his grip. Joseph of course inspired a ton of other people so I would say Koryan was the original popularizer of hypertapping.

They assume your first tap is on the first frame that the piece entires the screen. This is a difficult skill that takes a ton of practice, and is what the really good players do. Most beginner tappers don\u2019t actually time their first tap, but they just tap late as fast as possible and then hope. Tapping on the first frame is why you sometimes see a tapper early shift, because they are trying to time their first tap for the next piece. This skill is good to practice. When hypertapping something try to tap it the moment it entires the screen, not  after its already fallen a block or two.\n\n2. These are all minimum values. Yes you only technically need 12.5 hz to tap 9 left, but pretty much every tapper that does that consistently is closer to 13 and for 10 high most have 14hz. The current fastest tapper is EricICX and he can go do consistent 11 left, but he needs to tap 17-20hz to do that consistently, not 15. So when looking at these values, if you can do a certain height consistently your hertz is probably a little higher, and if want to aim for a certain height (8 is recommended) then you need to be faster than the value listed.\n\n\nI write this super long post so that you don\u2019t get discouraged about missing some of the harder taps and if you are inconsistent with them. There is a huge margin to improve and it isn\u2019t only tapping speed, which can feel very fixed, stopping you. I went from getting 7 high pretty consistently when I started to 9-10 high now, and my tapping is only something like ~0.5-1 hz faster.

They are fun to read!\n\nFor tapping, speed is important, but I feel like for a beginner the more important thing is precision, consistency and stamina. When I first started learning to tap I was kinda like you - I would be able to tap relatively fast left or right but I could never get anything to the middle and after half an hour my wrist would hurt and I would start tapping really slowly. Here\u2019s some advice I would give\n\nPrecision - this is your ability to move pieces to exactly where you want. So the ability to hyper tap a piece only 3 places is really good precision. You mentioned how often times you are only able to move pieces all the way to wall, and you don\u2019t have the precision. I recommend practicing moving pieces a specific distance, which is why b type is good hyper tapping practice. Also remember you don\u2019t have to always be hyper tapping. If you only have to move somethings once or twice or the board is low you can just tap the pieces kinda slowly to their position.\n\nConsistency - this is the infamous 2hz moments where one just messes up their taps and is way too slow. This just comes from getting used to the grip and lots of practice, but just try to be consistent with your taps\n\nStamina - I am sure after something like 30 minutes your wrist/arm/everywhere starts to ache. This gets better with time and a lot of tappers take around a month to get super used to tapping for long periods of time. Some advice. Try to make sure your grip is very comfortable in your hands. Don\u2019t move your body too much. If you are constantly vibrating a ton you will tire yourself out. Also you are allowing to tap lightly or use das occasionally in order to stop yourself from tiring out. I know a ton of really good tappers use das on level 19 so they don\u2019t tire themselves. Also make sure to stretch your arms and wrists occasionally.\n\nAlso, in case you didn\u2019t know, the world championships\u2019 qualifications were this week, so you can watch those games if you want to see how different skill levels stack differently. Try to notice mistakes and really good moves and incorporate them into your game. The main event will also happen in two weeks so you can watch that for stacking advice or just for fun. \n\nIf you continue practicing this much in such a concentrated way then I can see you improving very quickly! I practiced at around the same pace as you did and after 6 months I am participating in the ctwc main event (I\u2019m eren) so if you continue at this pace you can definitely get some very good scores this year!

I reckon starting on either level 9, or 12 would be best, but if you are confident you can try 15 or 19.\n\nFor scoring higher remember the goal is to score tetrises with the long bar, not clear as many lines as possible. Try to open up a \u201cwell\u201d on the right side more than four blocks high and slide long bars there. You get a lot more points and that is how you go from 100k to 500k.

Lots of luck playing tetris! \n\nThor's video is completely real, and the reason that it is confirmed legit is because it actually comes from the documentary!\n\nIf you want a good place for improving your game I recommend [Jonas' tetris lessons](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjvvUIYe8rKW3HDvoRiBohQdfBW6J3BXj) for a good baseline guide for stacking. [AGameScout's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RaqVGzhQTM) video on the tournament also explains the mechanics of the game and the difficulty of getting tetrises better than I could. The biggest thing that will help you improve is by looking at other good players and trying to predict where they put the pieces before they land. Usually people go watch the ctwc matches on youtube and  at 0.25x speed and try to predict the moves. Since both players get the same piece sets you can see who is playing better and try to emulate them. If you prefer someone teaching someone else on good stacking [TheMisterValor](https://www.twitch.tv/collections/C_1qwNEzIRZG4Q?filter=collections) does coaching sessions and explains why some moves are better than others else. He also uses the in game shift rather than hypertapping so it might be better for you. His vods are somewhat long though so that might not be for you. In the end the best way to improve is just playing and enjoying yourself.\n\nI hope all this information is helpful, and not excessive!

I got kinda carried away. Hope it\u2019s helpful!\n\nIf you want to see what were considered good scores around that time then I recommend watching \u201cthe ecstasy of order.\u201d It\u2019s the 2009 documentary that started the yearly tournaments and it mentions line records and what was considered good scores at the time. I think most of the people in the film had personal best scores of 850k+. Every player in the film had been playing since the game came out (except Alex) so their stories might be similar to yours also.\n\n\nYou could also watch the old Nintendo world championships and see if the contestants told their best scores. It might also be a nostalgia trip for you, but they don\u2019t hold up super well now. I think that if you could get a 600k back then you would have been really good and I think most of the contestants had 700k personal bests.\n\nFrom another comment you said you would only line out. While getting to killscreen consistently this way is still super impressive, it is easier than building up for tetrises. Usually the difficulty of scoring high comes from risk management while trying to keeping the Tetris well open, and if you just line out that difficult element of the game isn\u2019t there. If you want to come back to the game and try to get high scores you gotta learn how to build for tetrises.\n\nAlso it might be mechanical issue, but it\u2019s more likely latency from the tv and not the controller. If you use the button to move the pieces then the input latency from the tv can really mess you up and make play on 19 speed nearly impossible. If you still have a crt tv I recommend playing on it. \n\nAlso I know you saw the line record at 297 but remember that that is only the highest recorded line count at the time. Unless you were recording your games on vhs it wouldn\u2019t have really meant much. Thor Auckerland claimed to have gotten to 310 lines during that time but no one believed him because he had no video. Turns out he was probably right. So don\u2019t be too dismayed that you weren\u2019t in the record books, because at the time it was mostly just a few people who had the chance to record their games.\n\nAlso if you want to get back into the game I am 100% sure you can do it! There actually is another person, DLo, who played the game when he was young, was similar to you in skill, and only came back to the game recently and has gotten a max out. He is in his 40s and some other super good players (Koryan is 45~, Jonas is 40) are still amazing at the game and not teenagers.

For languages not closely related to English it isn't effective. The reason for this is grammar. Languages like Spanish, Norwegian, and Esperanto all have similarish grammars to English nut Korean is very different compared to English, and Duolingo tries to teach grammar simply through enough examples, with little explanation. [Here is a video explaining how complicated Korean can be](https://youtu.be/cJPQEVnr0fg) \nAnother problem is that generally these languages have poorly designed trees and don' teach that well. Lots of mistakes in translation. \nHere are a few recommendations instead.\nSo Korean uses Hangul, a phonetic alphabet that is not too difficult to learn. You should learn this 100%. [Here is a website you could do this on, but honestly you could do this anywhere.](http://www.koreanwikiproject.com/wiki/Learn_hangeul) I like this website because it also gives real words that you can say with the characters you have learned so far.\nAfter this you simply have to learn a lot of grammar and a lot of vocabulary. I have no idea what your goals are or how much time your are willing to put into this task so I will give some options.\nMost people r commend a book for language learning. I have not researched this in depth but I have heard good things for the book \"Talk to me in Korean.\" I have also heard some relatively good things about the Assimil course for Korean. Its a more audio based course and its a little pricy, but I used the books for French and I am now at a high level. They are a little pricey.\nIf you prefer casually working on Korean and don't really care for the huge time investment learning the language is you could use an app. I like the app Lingodeer. It also has a course on Hangul. The earlier lessons are free, so you can see what you like, but I recommend getting the subscription and doing all the lessons. Its a good introduction to the language, and it is pretty simple and fun.\nThere are other routes. I have seen multiple people simply spend many many hours learning mostly vocabulary, using books or podcasts. They would take a book, try to read, find every word they didn't know, make flashcards and then memorize, This route is very time consuming, but in a way it is the most effective path since in any language you need vocabulary.\nAlso I don't know your goals but if you are learning for family or friends it might be good to find a person that you can speak to in Korean or ask questions to.\nAlso if you are learning for things like K-pop or for the sake of it I will remind you that Korean is very difficult. It is considered one of the hardest languages for English speakers, and when the U.S government trains diplomats it takes roughly 2000 hours for the diplomats to learn Korean, as compared to 500 for French, and 350-400 for Spanish. So good luck.\n\n[Here is an example of extensive vocab and using Assimil for Korean. This guy speaks 10 languages so he is well trusted. he set himself a challenge to learn as much as possible in 90 days and he spent like 3 hours per day.](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLiFB-yYuG2himozgz6ljjbTKKc7UJ2few)", "created_utc": "1556589920.0", "edited": "False", "id": "em3wtal", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_biwqdj", "parent_id": "t1_em3nog6", "score": "4", "subreddit": "IWantToLearn", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjo5"}, {"author": "Cooliceage", "body": "I am sorry if this is late, and I am sorry if this is a useless reply but that is explained in the exact same sene you are referencing.

First these are hard language, like fsi says 2k+ hours of learning, so these are long term goals. Second Arabic has a lot of dialects which are not super distinct but are still sizably different. Also in Arabic there is the standard Arabic which is used in writing and some, some formal things, and breaching dialectal barriers. Therefore learning Arabic is kinds like learning two languages, and you have to choose your favorite dialect (Egyptian seems to be the biggest). Japanese on the other hand is difficult to learn because it has many attributes uncommon to large western languages. These include, agglutination, which is found in Turkish, Finnish and nothing else really, politeness/social standing, which is kinda done in French but this is a lot more, and the word order is different. Second the writing system is very very hard to learn. I wont go into detail but because it is a mixture of two phonetic alphabets and Chinese characters it is really difficult.
