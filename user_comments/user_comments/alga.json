There's another suffix that has the meaning more like \"the practice of\": ra\u0161yti -> ra\u0161yba (orthography), \u017evejoti (to fish) -> \u017evejyba (fishing), \u017evalgyti (to survey, to recon) -> \u017evalgyba (reconnaissance).

Nevertheless, that 5x cheaper stuff is all functional and useable.\n\nI've owned and rented bikes with Sora, Tiagra, 105, Ultegra R8000, Ultegra 6700, and to me the level of components isn't something very important. When well-maintained they all work great. Shimano even claims that mechanical 11-speed 105, Ultegra and Dura-Ace are functionally equivalent, the difference is only in materials, manufacturing methods and weight. The lower groupsets are harder to actuate and click louder, that's about it. \n\n\"Better wheels\" is also subjective and debatable if you don't care about speed. What else is there beside aero and weight? The looks? That wooshing sound they make when you get out of the saddle? The cheapest wheels like Shimano WH-R500 will be stronger than carbon wheels 10x the price, and will work much better with rim brakes.\n\nAs for the suspension gimmicks on road bikes, why? There's a reason why most road bikes don't have them: there's just no need. If you don't like the relative rigidity of a road bike, there are gravel bikes with bigger tyres and then XC MTBs.

A typical Duolingo course introduces you to about 2500 words and most of the grammar, usually glossing over the bookish forms not found in conversation. If you are industrious, you analyse the grammar tips, identify and work on your weaknesses, you can probably get to a solid A2 level from just Duolingo. However, that is just scratching the surface, you cannot claim you know the language at that level.\n\nDuolingo was my first contact with German. I've gotten through the course without filling out all the levels. Afterwards I was able to pick up a book I was interested in and work through it with a dictionary app and Google Translate in hand. It was an immense learning curve, but bumped my level substantially. I've read more books since, I'm able to follow most of the conversations on Easy German.\n\nI've been learning French for a couple of years in middle school, then 2 hours a week for a year at the university. I had just the basics. Getting through Duolingo rounded out my competencies. I was able to pick up Camus and have pleasure reading it with the help of the dictionary lookup feature on the e-reader. Then a couple more books.  While skiing in France I had no trouble interacting in cafes and shops, reading all the signage etc. Recently I've discovered that I can follow Youtube videos by the various francophone media outlets, [like this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuAp94D7Eik).\n\nA couple of years ago I've started the Italian course, studied a couple of months, went to Italy wit the family, then lost momentum.  Several months ago I've started again, got to about a 100 day streak, finished the Italian course at the single crown level and went on a bike tour in Italy. I spoke predominantly Italian there, except a handful of places like fancy restaurants or hotels where staff would switch to English out of courtesy (or, rather than suffering my broken Italian). I had simple conversations with people about my trip, interacted with the service staff at cafes and restaurants. I already have a few books loaded on my phone to take my Italian to the next level. Also, I've filled out the crowns to the second level with the \"test out of level 1\" feature. I feel I'm at the point of the diminishing returns with Italian on Duolingo.\n\nWith all my languages I feel I would benefit immensely from some speaking practice, either with a language partner or a tutor, but that requires planning, commitment, and overcoming the certain social anxiety, whereas with Duolingo I can just play a little game at my own leisure and progress a bit, and eventually learn enough of the basics to start consuming unadapted media.", "created_utc": "1635951340.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hj5l78b", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_qlktlm", "parent_id": "t3_qlktlm", "score": "1", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "alga", "body": "You're certain you don't ever apply your weight to the pedal, right?
