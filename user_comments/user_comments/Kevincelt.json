While english is not the official language of the United States, it\u2019s the de facto language being the default language for all major institutions and a majority of states.\n\nWith all that being said, not including subtitles is just stupid.

Not really a bad thing, but it is noticeable sometimes that Germans are less open to random interactions and have a less friendly demeanor.  This also leads to a lot less small talk.\n\n-people tend to be less religious overall, but the two main denominations are integrated more into the culture and institutions than in the United States where there\u2019s a lot more religious diversity.\n\n-Germany is way easier to get around with using public transportation than much of the US due to it being so compact and there\u2019s subsequently not as much car culture.\n\n-Germans tend to be more direct compared to what I\u2019m used to where there\u2019s a higher emphasis on being nice and trying to be a bit more \u201cdiplomatic\u201d.\n\n-There seems to be a much bigger hiking and nature culture than in my suburban sprawl area and a lot of families go on short trips to these places more often.  I\u2019m sure this is similar to other parts of the US though, just not mine.\n\nI\u2019m pretty happy living in Germany and besides a few culture clashes that rub me the wrong way, it\u2019s pretty nice and I can\u2019t wait till Covid ends and it\u2019s even easier to interact and meet with more people.", "created_utc": "1640358115.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hptb2wz", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_rnk6gm", "parent_id": "t3_rnk6gm", "score": "10", "subreddit": "AskAnAmerican", "subreddit_id": "t5_2uah7"}, {"author": "Kevincelt", "body": "Being a land of immigrants as well as one where people travel around and move relatively often, it\u2019s not an unusual question.

Another big difference between the EKD is that the EKD is a national church while the Catholic Church is an international one which means that the church in Germany must conform to what the entire Catholic Church agrees upon.  Also, catering to what society wishes is not always a positive trait, as was seen multiple times in the past century.\n\nAs I said above, with the Catholic Church being an international church, all 1.3 billion Catholics have in influence on things, so the fraction of the 22 million or so Catholics in Germany that want these changes get overruled.
