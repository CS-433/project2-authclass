Locally this might not be the case at all and there are many Protestant churches that act like this, but I feel like \"in theory\" as a Protestant I have more freedom to disagree with the church. I also dislike the hierarchical structure, especially with regards to the staggering cases of sexual abuse and rape, LGBTQ issues and women's rights . I am very annoyed that we cannot change anything locally, just because some old men in the Vatican think people somewhere else are not ready (it's not like they would actually bother asking tbh). Of course there are plenty of problems locally as well, but that isn't limited to Catholicism. \n\nNow, you might still want to convert for other reasons. Maybe it enables you to take part in opportunities that aren't open to Protestants. Maybe you want to receive communion and your priest isn't comfortable handing it out to non-Catholics. It might also be a way to more effectively advocate for change within the Catholic church, even if it is just locally.\n\nI don't think you have to change your believes just because you convert.

We didn't have communion in all services (I also didn't go to church every week and we had several services every Sunday, so I may have missed some). But in German the word \"Kommunion\" is only really used in Catholic churches, Protestants usually call it Abendmahl (\\[Last\\] Supper).\n\nNormally we would make a big circle while the pastor and helpers went around and handed out [\"bread\"](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hostie#/media/Datei:Hostia_i_komunikanty.JPG) and grape juice. Most people dipped their bread in the juice but some drank. The pastor and helpers would take communion last. Afterwards, everyone would hold hands and we would pray together. It was always an open communion, so everyone (even children, or non-christians) were invited.  \nI've been to a few other Protestant churches and communion practices are mostly similar though they differ on whether grape juice or wine is used and how often it is held. \n\nI am now mostly in the Catholic University Church in Austria. Every mass involves communion. The priest takes first and is the only one to take wine. Then everyone forms a line or (when we're less than 10 people he goes around) to hand out the communion wafers. Technically, only Catholics are allowed to receive communion but our priests don't mind and give it to me anyway.   \nAll other Catholic churches I've been to have been very very similar, though not all have been so inclusive.\n\nI really like Communion in Protestant churches but not as much in Catholic ones. For me, standing in a circle together and holding hands, in the end, are part of what makes it special. I also feel like, the parish receiving both bread and wine, and *before* the priest is nice and somewhat makes me feel like the relationship is more equal. I also feel like having it less makes it more special.   \nI've been to one (Protestant) church where they used to sing Taiz\u00e9 chants during Communion, which was very very lovely. (I also enjoyed communion in Taiz\u00e9 more than in other Catholic services).

In Portuguese ei or oi is more common and of course our favourite nasal diphthongs.   \nterminal n in Spanish often becomes a nasal in Portuguese, either with -m or the tilde (joven - jovem, distribuici\u00f3n - distribui\u00e7\u00e3o)  \n\n\nYou will probably have noticed some pronunciation differences even when words are spelt the same, particularly in the vowels (Portuguese has a lot more different vowels than Spanish), particularly in EP the S chiado might also stand out to you.

So sentences you would have to say with the subjunctive in Spanish can often be expressed with either subjunctive or personal infinitive. \n\nEnglish: You bought a book for her to learn Portuguese.   \nSpanish: Tu compraste un libro para que ella aprenda portugu\u00e9s.  \nPortuguese: Tu compraste um livro para que ela aprenda portugu\u00eas.   \nOR Tu compraste um livro para ela aprender portugu\u00eas.\n\nThe other thing are personal pronouns. These differ significantly from country to country, especially in the second person. However, even in EP the second person plural is pretty much outdated and has been replaced with third person plural voc\u00eas, whereas European Spanish still uses vosotros. voc\u00ea(s) in (Brazilian) Portuguese is used similarly to Usted(es) in Latin American Spanish (afaik) but even in EP it is not used as a polite form like in European Spanish. Instead you would say O senhor/ A senhora.
