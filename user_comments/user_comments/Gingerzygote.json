if you're not sure what you can take yet, it feels really good and its body safe yada yada yada but i'm mainly reccomending it first because you mentioned taking videos. it makes *amazing* wet sounds as it moves because of the suction cup things so it's easily my favorite to record with.\n\noona surprise: the only suction toy i've used tbh, because of the high prices of others, but this one is pretty affordable and gets the job done well so i also haven't had much of a reason to try others yet! it has four settings and it works really well hands-free as well.\n\nsmile makers the tennis coach: this one is particularly good if you're looking for something of a smaller girth that packs a punch and still hits every right spot. i'm generally a girth lover but sometimes when my body isn't being as receptive to girth this little thing feels SO nice buzzing away against the g spot. i like the flexible head. it's one of my oldest toys and it's still kickin'! its also a really bright color so probably good for videos.\n\nlovehoney luxury rechargeable silicone wand vibrator - i've had 3 wands and this one is my favorite so far! it's pretty big so definitely not a travel toy, but it holds a hell of a charge and has a lot of settings all of which work their magic. my favorite part is the lack of weird ridges some wands have on the head because cleaning those is just a lil annoying. if you watch for sales the lovehoney website has a lot, i got this for like $20 and its usually $80.\n\nbad dragon orochi (medium/medium): this one is up last because i've only used it a couple times so far, but i did already notice some perks of it. it's pretty girthy right from the head but oddly easy to slip in, i cannot figure out why but it does go in easier than a lot of other girthy stuff. so if you like girth but struggle with actually getting it in, this one is pretty thick yet smooth to insert. it has a really nice bump on the base which you can either grind on or even shove a vibrator between your clit and the bump to make both your clit AND the dildo buzz together. that's definitely my favorite part. also gorgeous design so a plus for making content with it.\n\nbonus: my fav lube is bad dragon cum lube. its water based but quite thick and slippery rather than watery so it lasts pretty long compared to like, ky or something in my experience.\n\ni honestly don't have any reccomendations specifically for anal or bdsm, because i'm just starting to think about exploring these. i'm currently waiting on a pretty pink ball gag lol.\n\n(edit: just looked at how long this is
