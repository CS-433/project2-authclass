If you don't take any deliberate action while watching, you won't be getting much out of it in terms of improving English skills. After the episode/movie is over, you can't do in English more than what you could before you started. It's \"watching for fun\", \"what happens next?\" kind of watching where English is not a priority. It's still useful to do it, if you don't get annoyed at unfamiliar words, but if you ONLY do this, you can expect to make much progress in English.\n\nThe second option is so focused on analyzing the language that it usually saps all joy from the process. If you try to pause for every line you don't quite understand to look up vocabulary, analyze grammar etc while watching, it not only becomes slow - it becomes a chore (and doesn't last, in the long run)\n\nThe optimal way of using TV shows and movies is to be in the middle.\n\nIf you watch a TV show episode for the 1st time, there's no point digging into vocabulary and grammar - you just want the story, if the TV series is any good.\n\nBut if you don't take any action afterward, you're missing an exceptional opportunity.\n\nThere are numerous ways you can make watching TV shows a learning experience by \"activating\" the process.\n\n**Here's what you can do** (depending on how much time you have):\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Recollect 3 most interesting phrases or unusually used familiar words #vocabulary \n* Rewind and do a 10-15 second shadowing #pronunciation \n* Rewind to a random place or your favorite/most interesting scene and think of an alternative response to the question/line in the dialogue #speaking #grammar #vocabulary \n* Write 1-3 sentences about this episode (#writing #grammar #vocabulary)\n\nFor example:\n\n* Your rating for this movie and why so high or so low \n* The character that stood out in this episode, and why you singled him/her out\n* Where do you think it's going? (the story or the relationship between characters) \n* There are numerous ways you can make watching TV shows a learning experience by \"activating\" the process.\n\nI've been doing it with my students using workbooks, and they love it, because it's creative, it's flexible, and they make progress.\n\nOf course, if you could meet and discuss the episode with people who've watched the same episode and are using the same activities, it would help you understand the TV show (and the language) better, consolidate what you've learned, and make speaking easier.", "created_utc": "1665821564.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ise6xkx", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_y3ycxg", "parent_id": "t3_y3ycxg", "score": "5", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "gorob4ik", "body": "Incredulously: it's outside her expectations, that's why she can't believe it.", "created_utc": "1664456994.0", "edited": "False", "id": "iqd2fyi", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_xr5y1j", "parent_id": "t3_xr5y1j", "score": "3", "subreddit": "EnglishLearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2u8ap"}, {"author": "gorob4ik", "body": "Another way to put the question: How do you prefer to watch movies: by random selection or by genre/topic etc?", "created_utc": "1663917974.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ipkm1uk", "is_submitter": "True", "link_id": "t3_xk2twu", "parent_id": "t1_ipbkwla", "score": "1", "subreddit": "EnglishLearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2u8ap"}, {"author": "gorob4ik", "body": "Prompt?\nGuide?", "created_utc": "1663860720.0", "edited": "False", "id": "iphafkf", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_xkk6my", "parent_id": "t3_xkk6my", "score": "1", "subreddit": "EnglishLearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2u8ap"}, {"author": "gorob4ik", "body": "Thank you!
