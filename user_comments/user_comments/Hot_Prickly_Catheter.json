[{"author": "Hot_Prickly_Catheter", "body": "I practically know nothing about Swahili but I think since basically all major languages are different to Japanese, being completely different doesn't make it any harder than other languages. I quickly looked at Swahili and its vowels seem pretty simple enough, it lacks lexical tones and spelling seems simple too. Indonesian's lack of verb conjugation and lexical tones which I heard makes it famously simple.  I guess that's why Indonesian and Swahili are put into the easiest category - they're relatively simple languages. As for Korean, u/pixelboy1459 summed it up well. I think being Group 1 in this list is like being in Category II/III of the FSI ranking for English speakers though.", "created_utc": "1662208089.0", "edited": "False", "id": "imx2ze4", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_x4fgqr", "parent_id": "t1_imwimzs", "score": "6", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "Hot_Prickly_Catheter", "body": "I found a list for Japanese speakers: https://alacartyo.com/language-difficulty-ranking-for-japanese/ \n\nWhile the sources used to make the list is definitely not FSI standard, it logically sorta makes sense to me, personally.
