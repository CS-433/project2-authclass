D&D Beyond is fully supported by Wizards, there\u2019s content reveals, interviews with WotC designers, and exclusively sells their content. \n\nThis thread is filled to the brim with fallacies. If WotC wanted to they could easily require D&D Beyond to accept a physical book to transfer ownership into the app. \n\nHowever, there is currently no way for them to guarantee one physical book = one redemption on D&D Beyond. The books don\u2019t have unique serial numbers and currently have no way of uniquely identifying that you own that one book. \n\nThink of textbooks, they either come with a code if you buy a brand new book or you have to purchase a digital code if the one included in the book as already been redeemed. I would bet that we can expect to see a system like this being implemented in 5.5/6E with codes applicable to systems like Roll20, Beyond, etc.", "created_utc": "1646502195.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hzh3mrm", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_t70huf", "parent_id": "t1_hzfbfs2", "score": "0", "subreddit": "DnD", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r9ei"}, {"author": "Jacksons123", "body": "Development on Arch for me has been ehhh.

I don't really think of scoring a double flip reset as \"being toxic.\"\n\nCould my casual MMR be higher? Definitely. I have blue tag friends that have <1k casual MMR though, so I don't really see how that's any sort of indicator of anything other than the fact that I don't grind casuals.\n\nMy number being 1800 comes from what RL6mans requires you to get Rank B, just because of how the skill requirements have shifted to get GC.
