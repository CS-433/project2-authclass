I was using a rat who had been dead for at least 2 weeks, but was frozen in that time. I made a 3-3 1/2 incision down his back and went in about a 1/2-1/4 inch deep. I stayed as close to the skin as possible, pulled the bones/muscles out of the tail and cut the leg bones at about the knee-elbow point. I tried to get as much fat off of him as possible and I added some baking soda to the inside to help with that. But he was still very stinky on his underside down by his belly and genitals.
