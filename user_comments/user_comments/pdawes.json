[{"author": "pdawes", "body": "I felt relieved and seen basically. Even though I was sure the bad things had happened and pretty confident I had PTSD it felt, at least to a part of me, like I was just making it up, or that it was some goofy Internet bullshit. I didn\u2019t expect diagnosis to be a big deal because I\u2019d already been going through life essentially self-diagnosed, reading self-help stuff for trauma and joining groups for PTSD but then when my therapist said matter of factly \u201cyour diagnosis is PTSD\u201d I just involuntarily started crying. Afterwards I felt filled with so much compassion for all the troubled times I\u2019d had trying to navigate severe symptoms all alone, arranging my life around avoidance, fear, self-medication, attachment disturbances, etc.\n\n\nBut I should mention that I had almost ten years between suspecting I had PTSD and being diagnosed by a real professional so I did have some time to process it. I definitely did have the whole \u201cit happened to the \u2018not me\u2019 part of myself\u201d strategy (very common btw, called structural dissociation) but it had already been falling apart (disastrously) over the years and I\u2019d gotten a couple opportunities to express tremendous grief about it.

To me it sounds like you are being groomed. The way grooming, as might happen in child sexual abuse, works is that the perpetrator continuously pushes the boundaries and escalates crossing the line, while asserting that what is happening is normal (just an exercise/game/etc) and makes the victim feel like they are equally consenting to it and asking for it. Given your history, even if there were no transference, a competent therapist should consider you especially vulnerable to this type of abuse and should be doing far more to assert the boundaries of a therapeutic relationship and reassure you that a sexual dynamic will not happen. What is happening is the opposite. She is pushing the line more and more and normalizing what is happening, which puts you unfairly in the position of having to question it or feel responsible. She may not be doing this intentionally or maliciously, but it seems at the very least like her not handling the situation or you as a client with appropriate care.\n\n\nIt is not your job to enforce these boundaries in therapy, nor AT ALL your fault that this happening, but there are some major issues here that to me point to you being in danger. If I were in your shoes, my gut response (as a client and therapy nerd not at all expert advice) would be to stop seeing her immediately and report her. I think trying to go back and talk through it would just work against you and undermine your defenses more than they already have been.\n\n\nPerhaps as a compromise you could seek out another therapist for their opinion on the matter?", "created_utc": "1667083639.0", "edited": "1667083860.0", "id": "iuaxmem", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_ygp4hz", "parent_id": "t3_ygp4hz", "score": "14", "subreddit": "TalkTherapy", "subreddit_id": "t5_39dpu"}, {"author": "pdawes", "body": "It's no big, like a lightbulb.

There are many steps along the way to developing a healthy relationship with the opposite sex and any one of those can be impacted by personal experiences and larger social forces in men's lives.\n\nA crude analogy might be like, in the same way society creates many opportunities growing up for women to learn to feel weird/negative about their bodies, society creates ways for men to feel weird/negative about women. Why don't all women have eating disorders or compulsions for plastic surgery? Why do some? Why are some frat bros so desperate to \"score\" another notch on the belt that they drug women at parties? Why do others notice and get them a safe ride home? It's just something you learn to navigate as you try to exist in the world and show up for the people in your life, or you succumb to it. I've known a handful of men in my life who turned out to be sketchy to women, sexually predatory, that kind of thing. Looking back, they all sort of struck me as \"14 years old\" inside.\n\nLastly I think a lot of men don't really understand this issue well because on average we're not as attuned to men around us having bad vibes towards women, and most if not all women have to learn to pick up on them as a matter of physical safety since their teen years. I got in an Uber with a female friend of mine, and the driver made some weird remark about not having holiday plans because he didn't have a girlfriend. To me it felt like a bad/dorky joke, to her it was a palpable resentful, dangerous feeling and she was glad she wasn't alone in the car with him.\n\nI have a lot of empathy for this as a survivor of domestic abuse; there are vibes I'm keenly attuned to that tell me someone is bad news that are never wrong, so when someone else tells me they have that feeling I listen. But it's hard to explain that to someone who can't relate to that kind of intuition, like imagine telling your boss that the nephew he hired to work with you is creepy. I've seen that kind of thing a lot in workplaces, there's a guy or two who make all the women's skin crawl but the men don't notice or understand, the people you try to tell about it want \"proof,\" minimize and invalidate it, etc. As a culture we're placing more value on listening to these voices and I think it's a good thing, but we'll see what if anything it changes.\n\nEDIT: lastly, with all sensitivity to the marginalized political status of women and the fact that almost all women experience this stuff through no fault of their own, I do think people with histories of victimization and abuse will often find the dynamic recreating over and over again, more than the average person. I've had a couple of friends who've experienced sexual abuse as children, and it seemed like they would always get the absolute bottom of the barrel of men everywhere they went, in dating or otherwise. It really colored their view of men in general and what they could ever hope to expect from partners, and they were usually the ones who would ask me questions like this.

I had a \u201cschool mode\u201d I could use to make superficial friends, and could actually be quite charming and funny (well... sort of, I was also pretty malattuned to people and socially \u201coff.\u201d A lot of times people mistook my weirdness for confidence or deliberate attempts at humor). But I lived a pretty lonely life. Nobody hung out with me or really knew how I felt... about anything, or who I was beyond the people pleasing front I put on. I let a ton of abusive partners in, compounding the problem I\u2019m sure, but that\u2019s about it. I was well into adulthood the first time I told a friend how I was feeling, and it felt... like a combination of the deepest cringe you could have, and as scary as jumping off a cliff. But it did something to open the door to relating authentically.\n\n\nIt\u2019s a big deal, and a real and definite milestone that people take for granted. Even to someone not traumatized, it was most likely a big scary deal for them as a child at one point. Which is an important thing to consider when receiving more conventional \u201chow to make friends\u201d advice; there may be internal and external milestones between point A and point B that people who haven\u2019t had these challenges don\u2019t account for. \n\n\nI guess I would say a good therapeutic relationship, where the therapist works to model a safe relationship, allowing and encouraging you to be yourself in front of another person, and then explores your difficulties with vulnerability will help a lot with this. Unfortunately not all therapists focus on this so it might be an important thing to bring up early on; sometimes therapists are pure CBT/solutions and would just respond to this with something like \u201clet\u2019s come up with five things you can do this week to meet more people\u201d which avoids the core of the problem and might do something to make things worse and compound shame. Something to watch out for.\n\n\nFriendship and intimacy are really about sharing vulnerability (gradually over time. It\u2019s a red flag of boundary issues if someone dumps everything on you right away). Even statements like \u201cI don\u2019t like this food\u201d or \u201cthis song reminds me of high school\u201d are forms of vulnerability. To a sufficiently traumatized person even these casual statements might feel unsafe or too exposed. But that\u2019s the meat of it, I think. Showing a little bit of yourself, then maybe that encourages the other party to show some back, you get to know one another over time, and so on. I\u2019m sure you can see how working on authenticity and vulnerability in therapy will have a big impact on this, even if it may not feel like tackling the loneliness problem directly.\n\n\nI\u2019ll also say that your age and life stage can be kind of generally a lonely one, (that can\u2019t have gotten better since the pandemic). Most people I knew experienced a lot of social alienation in their mid 20s as they transitioned from, for lack of a better word, student age to early adulthood. It\u2019s important to keep that in mind because it\u2019s easy to blame yourself or look for your own deficiencies when you\u2019re actually part of a larger macro phenomenon. I know it doesn\u2019t help solve the loneliness, but it\u2019s important to not let the inner critic go crazy about this. Mine did, and it caused me some dark times in addition to pushing away connections I could have had. I don\u2019t know why but 25 specifically was a howling wasteland of loneliness for me and the people around me.\n\n\nI don\u2019t believe you\u2019ll be lonely forever, but it would make a lot of sense to feel this way. In my experience the process is pretty exponential. For reference, I felt solidly the way you did around 22-23, maybe opened up to my first acquaintance turned better friend around then. Then at 25 I got some exposure therapy with a sales job, which mostly taught me that it was safe and sometimes desirable/fun to let my personality out with strangers, then at 27 a hundred people were at my birthday party. You don\u2019t need to go full extroverted life of the party mode, but just to say I truly felt like a lost cause or like the window for friendship and connection (and let\u2019s be honest, dating) was rapidly closing if not closed already, and it turned out to not be true at all.

Are your requests for space respected?\n\nI had an ex with severe ADHD (like, big deficits that constantly interfered with her life and physical safety, inability to drive, etc.). She would get flustered and go nonverbal and storm off in conflict (which was a massive trigger for me because I used to date someone who would do this + threaten/attempt suicide in response to simple boundaries). But in retrospect, I was unaware of how much I could really corner her and not respect her limitations and therefore escalate the situation sometimes. For my part, I should've let her have the space and trusted her to self-regulate and come back to the conflict later.

That level of compromise and mutual respect would've gone a long way and probably improved our relationship and conflict resolution over time.\n\nBut on the trauma end... I know not being heard is a big trigger for me and can have me spiraling. I don't go quite to the place you do in terms of behavior, but internally something gets tantrumy for sure.

I can trace this back to how things were growing up; my parents really did not listen or make space for me at all.

May be worth exploring your own history for similar dynamics.\n\nAlso, teenage years are a time when people develop their own personalities and wills of their own (think the ability to form their own opinions and say \"no\") and abuse of this developmental stage is almost normative (i.e. the popular idea that teenagers are moody/hormonal/evil simply for no longer being mindless and compliant). I had anxious parents who would \\*grill\\* me and put me on the defensive constantly in this stage. It seemed normal but now that I'm older I realize it's actually quite... bullying?

That it's actually quite rare for two siblings to be on the same page when it comes to processing family of origin stuff. There are all those concepts like being the scapegoat vs the golden child, or one child adopting the strategy of identifying with the abuser, etc. that can make not only the other sibling's experience different, but also how they have chosen to interpret it to survive. People who are in denial or even just precontemplative can  strongly react in minimizing and invalidating ways; they may be quite adept at doing it to themselves and constructing reality that way.\n\nTo the extent that I have experienced minimization and denial of this whole mess that has been a source of major challenges, understanding, and triumphs in my life, it can be very unsettling. When it's bad enough I start to question everything: my own perception, whether I was making it up, whether my therapists are just indulging me to take my money, whether my progress is progress or actually me moving in the \"wrong direction\" somehow. It can really spiral into \"everything I thought was real... isn't.\"\n\nI chalk it up to shame, basically. You can really default back into a narrative that explains reality and the chain of events leading to now in the most self-abusive way possible. Perhaps this is the inner critic; I've never felt a \"voice in my head\" per se. I absolutely go there when I call my parents. They don't even have to say anything, I just need to feel a subtle shift or quiet judgement from them. I just start thinking/feeling \"I am out of control and a loser on the brink of disaster. I can't manage my own life. I'm malingering. I got this crazy theory that my family was abusive through social media and self-help books and therapist shopping and really I just need to... I don't know, feel worse about myself? Accept that I'm a failure and work harder at giving up on life? Take worse care of myself?\" I have more resistance to it now because it doesn't make sense, but it can really sink into me on this emotional level in spite of this.\n\nAs a resource against this, I'm thinking about writing out a document that contrasts the shame based narrative, my trauma-informed narrative, and some bare bones factual events that I \\*know\\* happened and point to things not being okay or normal (like getting into abusive relationships immediately after leaving the house, a family therapist telling my mother our family had deep problems when I was 5, my parents going out of their way to keep the accommodations and interventions I was offered from me). In fact this thread kind of inspires me to go do it. I think it could really help to have some \"evidence,\" both of what happened and also of where my mind can predictably go when I feel bad.  \n\nI admire your courage in making this attempt to connect with your sister. I'm sorry it didn't go well but I can really appreciate the initiative and bravery of choosing connection like that, and trying to redefine family for yourself and your sibling. I kind of go back and forth on talking to my brother about this stuff but can't bring myself to do it. On the one hand, I see him as even more affected by our family of origin than I was; he was dealing with younger and more inexperienced parents and didn't have a sibling til he was 8, and altogether was more fight-y and less compliant which got him more abuse. He has alluded to thinking some negative things about our upbringing, and largely I think it would bring us closer together. On the other... I am not 100% sure he's a safe person to talk to.

Basically did a lot to create within me a consistent foundation of being present, taking care of myself, and appreciating life itself as a gift (I realize this last one is loaded because another form of \"just do it bro\" is \"just be grateful bro!\" but I do just genuinely feel it a lot).   \n\n\nIt didn't give me all the answers or solve all the problems in my life, but... it got my issues out of the way, and now I feel like I can tackle them like a normal person. Like I stopped waking up confused and lost in quiet desperation, or getting overwhelmed and hopeless from minor setbacks. Kind of feels like having a hand untied from behind my back that I didn't know was there my whole life. I actually can understand somewhat why people who don't experience this would think it's simply a matter of \"just doing it.\" There's a lot of little invisible points between A and B that people can take for granted but are actually huge milestones and victories if you didn't grow up with them.   \n\n\nI also would compare myself to my friends who seemed to make moves for themselves and live fulfilling lives (I read your thread). Looking back, the biggest missing piece for me was feeling ok and whole internally. These days I attribute that to a kind of shitty upbringing (raised by an alcoholic mom and an absent workaholic dad) and a pretty bad go at early adulthood (really bad abusive relationships back to back from 18-21). Just compounded a lot of feelings of shame and internal fragmentation. Plus a deep and constant fear that engaging in stuff like jobs or relationships would mean being totally overwhelmed and my identity being obliterated. Even when I had the means and opportunity to do stuff it was like I would stomp on the gas and the brake at the same time and burn out before starting. It's a hard thing to put words to; I can do it now because I've had some help and years to reflect, but at the time...   \n\n\nBeing stuck in survival mode and shame just makes life... hollow? or like something to get through rather than fully experience? I look back on times when I was just going through the motions with a lot of compassion now. I was really limping and flailing and didn't know it; I just sort of felt vaguely unhappy and like an irredeemable loser all the time. Sometimes I would wake up with a sense of great despair and emergency, knowing that something wasn't right and I needed to burn everything and move/start over, etc. and that could not coexist with the part of me that went on like normal.

But I also got maybe 60-80% of the way there through self help material too. The book CPTSD: Surviving to Thriving by Pete Walker, the Janina Fisher book I mentioned, and a youtube channel by a therapist named Patrick Teahan are all ones I've gotten a lot of value out of. Either in terms of understanding myself, or just clarifying what I needed in terms of help (like calling out bad therapy!).  \n\n\nI also feel like doing this internal work has cracked me open to larger ideas of purpose and meaning. It didn't provide it directly, but it did something to help me perceive and internalize it for myself.   \n\n\nIdk, there's a lot I could say and I enjoy writing about it but I don't want just ramble on.

It's extremely frustrating how hard it is, and how the people who need the most help are often the least equipped to navigate the system and advocate for themselves.   \n\n\nTo translate a couple of these terms into therapy words:   \n\"Think about it differently\" (I got this one a lot too, it sucked) is basically a lazy application of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) that is very common in the US and UK. Especially within large insurance frameworks, unfortunately. I used to think it was just what CBT was, but actually there can be good CBT out there. It's just that a lot of therapists can get stuck in this mode of thinking they're the hammer and everything's a nail (or a cognitive distortion) and basically just try and get the client to gaslight themselves. CBT in general also comes with a very present-focused view of treating the symptoms in the here and now, over helping the client understand themselves and their past experiences. This can be helpful for some and very minimizing and invalidating for others who want to talk about the past and its impact.    \n\n\n\"Just do it bro!\" or \"just make a list\" or \"just come up with a morning routine\" or, my personal pet peeve, (\"I feel like \\[x\\]\" \"well what would someone who is \\[y\\] \\*do\\*?\" I get kinda irritated just typing this). These are considered a *directive* (therapist tells client what to do) and *solutions-oriented* (therapist focuses on coming up with quick pragmatic changes in the present) approach.   \n\n\nSo those are the names of the things you're saying you want stay away from (and I don't blame you!).  \n\n\nAs far as what to look for, I'm sorry in advance for giving such a long and roundabout answer but I don't want to simply tell people what to do out of my own bias so I have to give some context re: what I was looking for and what worked for me. I'll try and put a tl;dr at the end.  \n\n\nI am very much on the \"complex trauma\" side of things. Basically I knew I had wounds from the past that were connected to the trouble I was having, and I had some understanding that a lot of what was plaguing me was coming from stress responses to stuff I was stuck in. I had a lot of issues with shame, low self esteem, being stuck in life, struggling with internal conflict (part of me wanted one thing, another wanted the opposite), not really having a clear sense of will or identity, etc. Clients with these issues also have pretty known challenges and issues with more basic types of therapy, which are often interpreted as stubbornness or resistance by uninformed therapists.   \n\n\nHaving a therapist who understands these issues and how they affect people, both in and out of therapy, is SO IMPORTANT. My first therapist told me I was being \"over-identified with the past\" and needed to just idk take vitamins and work out and come up with a morning routine and I'd simply forget about it. (If that had worked I would've solved my own issues years ago by going on mf youtube!) My second therapist actually knew what I was going through, at times better than I did, and diagnosed me with PTSD almost right away. Imagine going into a doctor with a broken arm and all he can do is tell you to do some push ups and ignore the pain! That is what a lot of people walk into with therapists who are not trauma informed.   \n\n\nUnfortunately \"trauma informed\" is becoming a bit of an empty buzzword, so it's important to ask therapists to explain what they mean by that, what trainings they've done etc. In my view therapists who are competent at this will be specialized in it, and not just generalists who claim to be equipped with all types of issues. [Here](https://imgur.com/4OJJLxr) and [here](https://imgur.com/zCfOn87) are links to what my therapist, the good one, listed on her page, that I considered huge green flags. When I had my initial consult I told her explicitly that I was looking to talk about the past and not be given solutions or CBT.   \n\n\n**Closest I can get to a tl;dr:** In general when therapists use terms like sensorimotor, internal family systems (IFS), somatic experiencing (SE), structural dissociation, developmental trauma, it is a good sign that they are in this camp too, so this is what I looked for. More broadly, therapy methods that are relational, person centered, humanistic, or depth focused are good to look for if you find CBT and solutions shallow and unhelpful.  \n\n\nUnfortunately, it seems like you are most likely to get this outside of insurance networks. A lot of the time you can work with partial insurance or out of network reimbursement to help cover the cost. At my last job I could just submit an out of network bill for reimbursement and they would cover 100% of the bill.", "created_utc": "1664236914.0", "edited": "False", "id": "iq1gvu5", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_xos2w6", "parent_id": "t1_iq13kl6", "score": "3", "subreddit": "AskMenOver30", "subreddit_id": "t5_2y9pw"}, {"author": "pdawes", "body": "4chan is older than the average discord user", "created_utc": "1664226203.0", "edited": "False", "id": "iq0s5bi", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_xncufm", "parent_id": "t1_ipte8cc", "score": "1", "subreddit": "AskMenOver30", "subreddit_id": "t5_2y9pw"}, {"author": "pdawes", "body": "I was a bit tongue and cheek about it, but in my mind Discord is for literal teenagers.

I think if you're used to \"man up and just deal with it\" and suffering in silence, you're almost certainly not used to asking for help from loved ones or naming and navigating complex feelings. Living like that could also  make you just generally feel like you're being selfish or a burden simply by expressing how you actually feel to people. Or that being honest about your internal state will make people leave you. I see a lot of it in your post even. \"Sorry for being here and talking about how I feel\" basically.

Is it really helpful or new information for you to hear someone say \"just make a list and take small goals!\" Or do you actually need help with something more internal, having a better relationship with yourself and others, having a clearer and more peaceful sense of your will? etc.\n\n\nFor me, what helped the most with the exact feeling and problems you're talking about... was therapy. But specifically therapy with a relational focus that was focused on helping me to open up, be myself in front of another person, and process my own overwhelming emotions without judgement or being pushed into action right away. Which can be harder to find compared to than therapy simply focused on coping skills or reducing symptoms (I tried the latter and it really sucked, honestly felt like more of the same \"just do it bro!\" but way more expensive).

The pain and struggling is often part of a larger process of grief and change, and can precede great progress and healing.\n\nYours sounds like a horrific upbringing, compounded by a very real and terrible injustice. It is normal to be struggling as a result of that; what would be abnormal would be brushing it off and functioning like nothing happened. Some people \\*do\\* manage this... until they drink themselves to death at 35, abuse their children, lethally overdose, etc. The cost of denial and repression is so high.

I have a friend like this and though it\u2019s not my place to say, I believe that she\u2019s mostly being taken advantage of.\n\n\nBut on the other hand, there are therapists who will stick to the insurance playbook and try to speedrun you through stuff so they can kick you out after six weeks.

I went in seeking trauma work and kept feeling dismissed or invalidated, told I was basically fine, that I was \u201cover identifying with the past.\u201d He never said what his approach was but I\u2019ve since pieced together that it was brief solutions oriented therapy and the shallowest parts of CBT; some focus on coping skills to \u201creduce symptoms\u201d (which I didn\u2019t really need at that stage) and mostly coaching toward my \u201cgoals,\u201d no real depth, curiosity about, or help navigating my experience, past traumas, relationship patterns, or emotional reality. \n\n\nI also felt like he didn\u2019t know what to do with me (because he didn\u2019t!) and like he was just this blank receptacle for me to generate all the answers. He once cancelled a session because I didn\u2019t know what to talk about in the first five minutes. It just felt like this shitty coach I\u2019d go in and see and talk about my week with no continuity from last time and he\u2019d tell me to take vitamins. I also felt like I was constantly waiting for the real therapy to start.\n\n\nAs far as whether it\u2019s normal... It is a style of therapy, but not the only one. Some people just need a coach to give them solutions and tell them to come up with a morning routine and support them while they go for that promotion or whatever. People looking to navigate trauma will probably find it lacking and shallow at best. It was not at all what I needed and in fact kind of recreated some of the invalidation and toxic positivity I grew up with. I was very much better served by switching to a therapist who was actually equipped to handle my issues. I wrote more in depth about the experience [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSDNextSteps/comments/n0q3h8/therapy_is_feeling_shallow/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=mweb3x).\n\n\nAnnoyingly, sometimes therapists can claim to be trauma informed when they\u2019re not. Or they can conceal or misrepresent their approach, not tell you up front what they\u2019re about, or insist that \u201cthis is just what therapy is, any therapist will tell you the same things\u201d etc. Not true! There are many different styles and approaches, with their own competencies and emphases. To me the fact that you\u2019re identifying these problems, experiencing them affecting the therapeutic relationship (feeling pressure to be easy etc) AND, most importantly, that you have voiced these concerns with no change is an indicator that it\u2019s not a good fit.

And your last bit about the \u201cfuckboy vs hubby material\u201d is really profound to me. It mirrors my own struggles with FA attachment and my own complimentary set of experiences and beliefs about relationships that I struggled with. It\u2019s actually quite revelatory and humanizing to hear it expressed from the other side, so I really appreciate it. \n\n\n\nI spent my teens and 20s in abusive relationships, with people who were extremely needy and controlling. A couple of them I never even wanted to date and basically kept the whole thing up out of people pleasing, because they were so AP and aggressive about it and I felt unsafe saying no. \n\n\nAt some point I snapped and had kind of this angry and cynical phase where I was determined to be the hardened player who could get laid and have fun but not need anyone. I developed this black and white belief that to any given woman you were either the hot fun, one night stand guy she actually desired, or the one who got stuck taking care of her after she wanted to settle down and use you for resources (some nasty corners of the Internet call this \u201calpha fucks vs beta bucks\u201d). I went through a phase of trying to act as emotionally unavailable as possible, and actually at one point successfully became the kind of avoidant douche women ask reddit for advice about. \n\n\nI was never really that person but I was so determined to LARP as him, because deep down I saw relationships as a trap and I never wanted to be taken advantage of again. Surprise! I found those casual situationships very unfulfilling and kind of anxiety provoking once I got them. I also was deeply afraid (and envious?) of a kind of hardened \u201cmaneater\u201d type of woman I\u2019d encountered a bunch, including in my younger years when I was more anxious and more easily taken advantage of. Think Samantha from sex and the city. I saw a type of woman who seemed to only have one night stands, and got to use men for sex without getting tied down, and it triggered a lot of shame and envy in me, like they were winning and I was losing. I was desperate to become more avoidant and \u201ccatch up.\u201d\n\n\nAlong the way, I did have a lot of people who wanted me for relationships but it seemed like only in a \u201cserious\u201d way where they wanted to settle down and use me for my stability as \u201cdad.\u201d Sometimes it felt nice, but it didn\u2019t last because it sucked to be used and trapped and I was so fed up with history repeating. Partners perceived me as hot and cold, one foot out the door, and probably giving a lot of signals that I wanted deeper connection but using a lot of words expressing the opposite. \n\n\n\nAll that is to say, I really do relate to all of this. What ruled me was this pattern of feeling like my only options for relating where chasing someone hardened and unavailable (or \u201cwinning\u201d by becoming even more hardened and unavailable myself, moving from FA to DA maybe) or being trapped, giving up my wants and needs and self-expression to someone else\u2019s needs, performing the \u201chubby\u201d role they wanted me to play vs who I really was. You might even say I was *fearful* of being left out while *avoiding* being needed. (I wonder if there\u2019s some kind of... word for that style of attaching \ud83d\ude0f)\n\n\n\nAnyway, through therapy and work on myself (in and out of relationships) AND meeting someone who could really see me and be a true partner to me, I feel like I have finally gotten the point of relationships. I really did use to think they were just these shitty things that happened to you, or that you just got stuck in. It turns out that you can be with someone who just... makes your life better and easier and wants to, whom you still want to spend time with and be romantic and sexual with, and it doesn\u2019t need to be this horrible dramatic chase or suffocating entanglement. It enhances your life and feels consistently good. I guess that\u2019s what all those normies were after all along.

Therapists who aren't trauma informed can interpret triggers or emotional responses as stuckness, defiance, \"resistance,\" or cognitive distortions and it was 100% what was going on. It was, in retrospect, not only unhelpful and not worth the money, but also did me some harm. I wrote a little about it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSDNextSteps/comments/n0q3h8/therapy_is_feeling_shallow/)\n\nA year ago I was very much in the \"fuck CBT\" camp because of this experience and a lot of the creepy history of behaviorism. I've learned since that it's not inherent to CBT necessarily, but that a lot of, I guess you could say \"lazy\" practitioners of CBT will have these kinds of simplistic and invalidating attitudes towards the clients that are harmful. Having hammers and seeing everything as nails. There are great therapists out there who employ techniques from CBT without simply calling everything a cognitive distortion. There's a really important part of CBT that gets into examining \"core beliefs\" (e.g. \"I am bad/defective, I am doing it wrong\") that a lot of therapists seem to simply ignore.\n\nCBT as an intellectual trend in therapy has a particular context. Basically focusing on skills-based, practical, managerial approaches to reduce symptoms with a strong emphasis on standardization and quantitative clinical research. It's a reaction to the really \"out there\" elitist academic psychology of the 50s and 60s. There's a kind of rigidity that comes from that I think; a disinterest in things like \"root causes,\" individual inner life, carried shame, deeper relational patterns, etc. that cannot be easily parsed in the strict terms of placebo controlled clinical trials.\n\nTo me that rigidity can make for limitations in the therapy room. To the client, it can feel like a surface level band-aid approach (or just straight up gaslighting if it's bad). On the therapist's end, if they have these blind spots towards the \"softer\" qualitative parts of their job, they can make it all the way through their training and really bring a lot of their own biases into the therapeutic relationship almost entirely unexamined.

I got to an unprecedented level of closeness and it was making me sensitive to abandonment for the first time; I was getting in touch with my needs in a relationship that lived underneath the avoidant belief system of \u201cI don\u2019t need anyone, I\u2019m low maintenance\u201d etc. so when my gf was paying less attention to me because of work stress, or being kinda selfish in bed, it was actually starting to affect me. \n\n\n\nIt would trigger a flight response and I would get all caught up in push-pull ambivalence, or feelings of needing to leave, or feelings of wanting to devalue her or push her away. I would see her as physically unattractive, really obsess over whether or not the relationship was right (I\u2019d stay up late at night and go into \u201cdetective mode\u201d and go through my journals and notes to find patterns and faults), feel an intense sense of FOMO/time running out/urgency to make a decision and leave. (Interest from other people seemed to trigger this one). I\u2019d have this sense like I\u2019d fooled myself and couldn\u2019t trust my own judgement, that the good feelings I had were an illusion or me being codependent or a sucker or something. Sometimes I would also create conflict for closeness. Not picking fights per se but like, getting into big inconsolable moods and bringing them to her with complaining and venting. \n\n\nI could go on and on about this. I have learned so much about it over the last year, and I found a good therapist who has really helped. But in the end I am super glad I did not act out of these feelings and end the relationship. It does not mean I\u2019m committed for life and that\u2019s the end of questioning or potential for breaking up, but there was a lot of fear and inner wounds clouding my thinking and a lot of those painful and confusing feelings have been replaced with a deeper closeness and security in my relationship. If we do break up, I\u2019ll do it because I decided to with a calm and reasoned mind. I have a lot more confidence in my ability to make decisions.\n\n\nThe tricky thing about attachment stuff, particularly around unmet and ignored developmental needs, is that when it flares up it comes with this feeling of \u201cthis is the real me and I\u2019ve been living a lie!\u201d In reality its more like the part that goes on with normal life and the part that is hurting are both the real you and need to be brought lovingly to the table.

I have seen many people become huge cokeheads and \u201cshy guy with confidence issues\u201d is the biggest archetype by far. Not only does it make you temporarily assertive and outgoing, but it also will make you popular (because you become \u201cthe guy who has cocaine\u201d) and attract women who want to know you and have sex with you for access to drugs. And I mean it\u2019s not that unusual; a lot of people get into alcohol for this reason too. \n\n\nHOWEVER, using this substance for this purpose will also set you up for addiction, financial ruin, life-changing if not fatal health problems, potential serious legal consequences, exposure to violent criminals, and generally what I\u2019ve seen in people who go down this route, particularly the shy guys looking for confidence, is that they invariably become total fiendish rapey assholes whom people only want to hang out with to use them for drugs. They don\u2019t really seem to notice the tipping point, where it stops helping and starts hurting, either. I have seen this many times. When the drug fills an emotional need for people is when they get in trouble with addiction. \n\n\n\nIt sounds like you\u2019ve actually done a good job identifying a problem and potential solution for yourself. However it still seems to resolve around an external source, an exogenous substance to change your personality and give you the ability (or permission?) to relate to women with sexual intent (I don\u2019t like the word approach, it\u2019s too PUA). This is a normal social skill and part of life that, like learning how to make friends or value yourself, can be disrupted for people in their upbringing. \n\n\n\nPerhaps there is a way to work on fear of rejection and, if I might guess, shame around expressing your own sexuality (did you grow up religious or in a household that taught that sexuality was bad/dangerous?), that doesn\u2019t involve playing with fire. You mentioned that you\u2019ve been in therapy for five years but haven\u2019t made progress in this area; personally if I were in your shoes I would try out another therapist more specialized in these issues (vs a generic, supportive, talk about your week and reduce anxiety and depression symptoms therapist). I am not a therapist but I\u2019ve been to a lot of them and that\u2019s just my opinion.\n\n\n\nIf you\u2019re dead set on experimenting with illicit drugs more, which I can\u2019t recommend, I\u2019m just gonna flat out say that MDMA will probably give you more of what you\u2019re looking for with potential for a more lasting therapeutic effect. But you can also get into trouble with it too, both in terms of addiction and health consequences. Again, not recommending this, but speaking as someone who was in that scene as a younger man it\u2019s a better choice if you have to do drugs. From a harm reduction standpoint as well as... idk cocaine attracts a much scummier element than MDMA people. Better to end up in a burning man polycule than robbed by a cartel guy.\n\n\n\nOr, you could talk to a doctor about more mainstream pharmacological intervention, perhaps Wellbutrin (which works somewhat similarly to cocaine and MDMA except in a more controlled and time released fashion) may be of great benefit to you. Or perhaps you have undiagnosed ADHD, which can feature something called rejection sensitive dysphoria. Not uncommon for people with ADHD to self-medicate with cocaine.\n\n\n\nBut also, you are 23 and still hitting your stride. Maybe try going out again and seeing if you can access some of the \u201ccocaine mindset\u201d without the drug. Sometimes practicing being outgoing can show you that it\u2019s safe to do so, and really reinforce your confidence. For example, I went through this with a sales job at 24, starting out with a shyer personality like yours, and discovered I was an incredibly extroverted and flirtatious person, just through repeated exposure. Perhaps you can look at this cocaine experience not as proof that you need cocaine, but rather a taste of what it is like to feel confident and outgoing esp with women, and an important step on the larger process you are on of cultivating those attributes in yourself as a young adult.

Night and day better. Mine is trained in sensorimotor therapy and while that body-based approach has been helpful, the \u201ctalking\u201d aspect is a lot better too. I am starting to believe that the efficacy of therapy comes down to how well the therapist can \u201csee\u201d the client and their issues rather than any specific modality. It\u2019s easy to get into the weeds about which therapeutic tool is best but if you can tell the person is not hearing or seeing you, and expecting you to just come up with all the answers (unfortunately a lot of therapists) this will screw things up in any therapy style. \n\n\nI\u2019m curious if you could expand more on what \u201ctalk therapy\u201d means to you in terms of what you\u2019re not getting, or what kinds of things get in the way. It can be really hard to articulate what\u2019s lacking or specific to a therapeutic relationship and very easy to intellectualize it in terms of therapy style. \n\n\nI started out with a very unhelpful therapist who was not trauma informed. It was hard for me to pin down exactly what was working. It was at worst very minimizing and invalidating (at one point he said \u201cthat was so long ago, why is it still affecting you?\u201d), and at best basically kind of generic approach focused on managing symptoms (which, as another decently \u201cfunctioning\u201d person, were pretty subtle). I went in and kind of vaguely talked about my week, got triggered constantly, and didn\u2019t really get much in the way of answers or understanding; just generic support and unsolicited advice about morning routines. He had this idea like if I just \u201cworked hard\u201d at shallow self care stuff like getting up at 5am (wtf) I would \u201cfeel better\u201d and simply stop thinking about the past. \n\n\nIn addition, looking back, I was also felt generally really rushed through the process. Not a lot of care was taken to ease me in, not a lot of curiosity extended to my deeper feelings and reactions. To put it in inner child terms, the therapist did not \u201csee\u201d the child in me at all. He just kind of ignored it and treated me like a stubborn, malingering adult. Ironically a pretty good recreation of how dysfunctional adults treated me growing up. To me, being trauma informed is the opposite of this. My new therapist is very curious and gentle, encourages me to slow down and explore things, makes a lot of room for me to change my mind, be uncertain. You know, all that stuff Pete Walker\u2019s book tells you to do to yourself. It makes a HUGE difference.\n\n\nThe experience of my first therapist was so bad, and the therapy so expensive and highly recommended, that it made me wonder what anybody ever even got out of therapy. Maybe the whole thing was bullshit, or my expectations were too high and life was just about \u201cpowering through\u201d all the feelings I was still struggling with.\n\n\nI saw [this video](https://youtu.be/HuJIQkJ-_G8) recently and it was very helpful at processing what was so wrong. My bad therapist was somewhere between the \u201capologist\u201d and \u201cblank slate\u201d archetypes, and seeing it highlighted in these video examples really helped me make sense of it.

All my life I thought I hated clingy people, my partners always seemed to chase me, I\u2019m avoidant etc.) and basically my current partner has some issues around intimacy and kind of withdraws from the moment after orgasm. I feel very on my own and not loved/prioritized/valued when this happens. But for like a year that only registered to me as \u201coh I think I\u2019m not that physically attracted to her.\u201d \n\n\nI also think there is a degree to which stability can feel boring if you\u2019re used to more toxic relationships.

I think all traumatized people get abused by systems by and large, but that that gets filtered through traditional expectations and identities to come out in different ways, and that combines with existing discrimination and vulnerability in marginalized groups. The care your friends are receiving though strikes me as atypically good and not the norm.\n\nBased on my experience I think there\u2019s more of a default of minimizing and invalidation when you\u2019re male? \u201cOh you\u2019re fine/just do (unsolicited \u201cwork hard\u201d advice)/man up etc.\u201d And in general a lot less tolerance for neuroticism or emotional needs. You can even see this on online support groups, where a man will report obvious signs of mental illness or disability and people will tell only him he\u2019s \u201cbeing an asshole.\u201d People see you as more in control and expect assertiveness so you get seen as more willfully selfish or obstinate when you\u2019re acting out of mental illness or emotional turmoil, even as a very little kid sometimes. I had selective mutism at 5 and people thought I was just being \u201cbad.\u201d Instead of help or diagnosis I got a lot of punishment and discipline for exhibiting systems, which continued well into adulthood. I had another male friend who was diagnosed with all kinds of things as a child, and horrifically institutionalized, forcibly medicated, isolated, accrued a ton of medical trauma, and is now a shut-in on disability in his 30s. All because of struggling at school from religious abuse at home. My guess is there are a lot more men with stories like yours... in jail. Particularly if they\u2019re of color. \n\n\nThe other side of that is people seem more willing to accept emotionality in women, but also to pathologize it, think of women as \u201cout of control\u201d or \u201cdramatic,\u201d that kind of thing. The rich history of personality disorder diagnoses in women, and hysteria before that, reflects this IMO. For whatever reason in my experience women seemed more likely to interact with medicine and seek help from doctors and psychiatrists, even in our school years. I know way more women on SSRIs etc. The men I know who had more \u201cpsychiatric\u201d approaches to their mental health (\u201cjust see a doctor bro!\u201d) have stories more like yours, including stigmatizing misdiagnoses and wildly escalating polypharmacy. I think the dismissive, patronizing, and bodily violating way doctors treat their power dynamic with patients in general really resonates with and amplifies the specific kinds of everyday abuse and discrimination women are used to receiving. I hate the condescending and entitled way doctors treat me and prod my body and I\u2019ve wondered before if the doctors office is like a little vacation into being treated more like a woman. \n\n\nBut in terms of trauma diagnoses specifically, it was hard as fuck to be taken seriously. I 100% would have more misdiagnoses if I\u2019d sought help sooner, especially from psychiatry. My first therapist pushed the \u201cdon\u2019t think about your past just work on these skills\u201d stuff, as well as telling me the \u201cjust forget about it/work hard/man up\u201d stuff I\u2019d heard all my life, and ascribing a lot of selfishness and willful defiance to my struggles. He also decided I was a drug addict for no reason (I don\u2019t do drugs!). It cost me about $30k to navigate the system enough to find a proper diagnosis, and I still feel a lot of shame or that I am malingering when I think of explaining that I have post traumatic stress disorder from childhood trauma and sexual abuse/IPV. It is not \u201csupposed\u201d to happen to men, unlike idk PTSD from war. \n\n\nI don\u2019t know I guess I\u2019m saying it all sucks, the systems are bad, traumatized people, especially children, are vulnerable to abuse from the resources that are supposed to help. I\u2019m not at all trying to minimize women\u2019s experiences, and I know there is a well evidenced statistical pattern of doctors taking women less seriously, but I do bristle at the \u201cif I were a man it wouldn\u2019t be bad\u201d stuff because it invalidates a lot of trauma. I\u2019m not some MRA weirdo I just have eleven male friends who are dead from suicide and overdose because the help just wasn\u2019t there, or only came in the form of punishment and repression.

People are lonelier than ever, especially in certain parts of the US which may be economically blighted or devoid of opportunities for young people (particularly young men) to fit in and belong. For an example, a dude who has undiagnosed autism and works overnights at Walmart in a small town may face significant issues with social alienation and \u201cfailure\u201d to achieve developmental milestones like forming first relationships or fulfilling expectations for career and education etc. and maybe not really know why, or have access to any resources that might help. \n\n\nI think a lot of the incel phenomenon is people caught up in these cohorts but filtering their problems through the logic of widespread body image issues from social media and dating apps, which is a relatively novel thing for men to be dealing with publicly. That is the piece that makes you think \u201cwomen only want chad.\u201d \n\n\nI disagree with the idea that it comes primarily from \u201centitlement.\u201d I think people like Elliot Rodger, who was likely a grandiose narcissist obsessed with status and bought lottery tickets every day so that the universe would recognize how he simply deserved to be rich, created that cultural theory. But by and large I see less of those people (not zero) and mainly see dudes struggling first with feeling hopeless and \u201cless than,\u201d and the toxicity and misogyny coming downstream as echo chambers form for people to try and make sense of their situations. \n\n\nIt is harder to be a hateful shitty man and have women put up with you these days. That\u2019s a good thing. I think this is what the \u201cbare minimum\u201d talk alludes to. Women\u2019s standards have gone up a ton in terms of not tolerating abuse or being treated like property. \n\n\nBut IMO it\u2019s independent of the phenomenon of people who struggle socially and for whom something normal (a different kind of \u201cbare minimum\u201d) like making a friend or asking someone out on a date might be a big milestone that they need more explicit instruction on. I actually see some casual ableism on this sub sometimes, where someone will post talking about severe social issues likely due to something like autism and be told it\u2019s all in their head, they\u2019re making excuses, not taking action etc. I\u2019ve worked with special needs kids so I\u2019m very sensitive to this attitude of like assigning selfishness to someone who is hitting a roadblock of disability they don\u2019t yet understand.\n\n\nAnd even still independent of the body image issues stuff. Tinder, Instagram, tiktok make people feel hopelessly ugly, and severe issues from that is no longer just the domain of young women, but we have very little vocabulary to talk about that. I think guys who are insecure about being rejected because they are short and base their worldview around that hear \u201cbare minimum\u201d and think it refers to impossible standards for looks. \n\n\nAndrew Tate is a grifter and a moron and his popularity is more of a sign of our failure as a society to talk about these issues. I can very easily understand how people like him can take advantage of insecure young men. The bar is very low because of how few positive or empathic conversations there are about this.

Psychoanalysis is a specific tradition of therapy and academia dating back to 19th century figures like Freud and Jung, then later figures like Klein and Fairbairn. On the therapeutic end it involves four sessions a week of intense therapy where the client predominantly just talks and the therapist predominantly observes silently trying to be as much of a \u201cblank slate\u201d as possible, perhaps even sitting behind the client. Most people who go to therapy now would find this highly irregular compared to what they get. If you\u2019ve seen Mad Men, Don Draper\u2019s wife (forgot her name) gets sent to a psychoanalyst.\n\n\nAcademic psychology tends to look at psychoanalysis very uncharitably these days, at worst considering it a harmful pseudoscience like astrology, at best a weird history that provided a foundation of important ideas and concepts. Like your weird great grandpa that no one likes to talk about who invented the first car tire but seemed weirdly obsessed with penises. I\u2019m not saying I agree with that just that that\u2019s how it\u2019s viewed by a lot of the mainstream.\n\n\nPeople use the term \u201cpsychoanalyze\u201d colloquially a lot to mean... I don\u2019t know, just generally getting inside someone\u2019s head and exploring the hidden motivations they have? Many therapists might do things like that, but classical psychoanalysis as a therapeutic approach is a lot more rare.\n\n\nIf someone goes to a therapist today they are likely interacting with a practitioner of like four or five mainstream traditions of therapy (and most contemporary therapists probably employ a blend of each). \n\n\nThere\u2019s relational/humanistic therapy where the focus is on the therapeutic relationship; that is the therapy room itself modeling a healthy relationship, and the goals of therapy revolve around self-actualization for the client. Helping people reach their potential and get out of their own way, you might say. Clinical social workers tend to be more in this camp on average. \n\n\nThere\u2019s the more skills based behavioral therapies like CBT and DBT where the goal is to teach the client coping skills to reduce symptoms of psychiatric illness (which can be quite broad and include diagnoses like anxiety and depression). The more \u201cmedical\u201d and insurance based a therapist is, the more likely it is they will be in this tradition. These methods are designed to be brief and standardized, and rooted in clinical research, so institutions largely prefer to pay for them over other methods. In the UK their first line of therapy through public health services is 8 sessions of CBT. \n\n\nThere\u2019s psychodynamic, which is probably the closest in philosophical lineage to psychoanalysis, and focuses on the impact of formative relational dynamics (like family and early childhood) on the present. Perhaps someone keeps getting stuck in a string of abusive relationships and this has its origins in how they were treated at home. A psychodynamic therapist would try to help them name and explore these patterns, in the hopes of understanding and changing them. \n\n\nThere\u2019s \u201csystems\u201d based therapy that basically revolves around looking at groups of people like families or marriages/couples as systems where each member has their own role. If someone wants to improve communication in their marriage for instance, or a family as a whole wants help with dysfunction or substance abuse, they might see someone for this. Not surprisingly, LMFTs (Licensed Marriage and Family Therapists) are the ones most likely to practice this way. \n\n\nAgain most therapists today will probably take bits and pieces from all approaches but will tend to specialize somewhat in one of these main camps.\n\n\nIn the US, the only people allowed to practice therapy and call themselves therapists are clinical social workers (LICSWs), counseling (masters level) psychologists (LPCCs), doctorate level psychologists (PhD or PsyD), and marriage and family therapists (LMFTs). The term \u201ccounselor\u201d is less regulated and can involve anyone but in my mind makes me think of more supportive sub-clinical paraprofessionals.

Is it even possible to learn those crucial social skills at an age where 95% of people are expected to have already learned them? It feels like someone only starting to learn how to talk when they're an adult.\n\nYou might be surprised about this. In my experience a lot of people who seemed like they were the authorities because they had predominantly casual sex with lots of people (something society really glamorizes) turned out to actually be the most \"inexperienced\" in a sense. It takes time and vulnerability to get to know people's bodies and if you're someone who only has one night stands, maybe only while very drunk (as often happens), you may actually not learn a whole lot. I had a brief relationship with a woman who'd had casual sex with over 60 men (which is like, top 1% of sex havers statistically, really intimidated me at the time) but was too insecure to kiss because she \"didn't know how.\" It can and does happen like this. \n\n  \nI hear you on the insecurity re: lack of experience. You will have learning to do, and that's ok. Things that other people take for granted may feel like major milestones to you. This can be both a stressful and enjoyable thing, because you may find yourself grappling with insecurity, but you may also savor small things as big victories. Also, you're still very young, and given that plus COVID and all the isolation of the last two years, a lot of your peers (including the women) have probably missed out on a ton of experience themselves; they may even be having varying degrees of the same insecurities as you. Moreover, especially at your age, the women you'll be having sex with might only be used to fumbling, unsatisfying sex with drunk, selfish idiots because that's the way it goes a lot of the time.  \n \n\nBUT you should also understand that your lack of experience actually logically makes you a poor judge of your own prospects. If you don't know what it's like, you can't really say that you'll be bad at it, or a burden, or incapable of connecting. You will most likely find that the whole thing works according to a different logic than the one your insecurity creates. Some things will be confusing, others will be easier than you thought.  \n\n\nI would suggest focusing on your own progress and accomplishments; it sounds like you've actually made a lot of changes, both with 28lb weight loss (huge!) and your recent testosterone diagnosis (I know TRT can be life changing for people, both physically and mentally).

A desperation to \"catch up.\" Try and remind yourself that you have plenty of time (you really do), it isn't an urgent emergency, you're making the changes you need to, and that you're not a defective person horribly behind everyone else, but rather a person with a unique set of challenges and experiences that have led you to the place that you are. The last part is true for everyone, and if they have worth than so do you.

I believe this peaked with the millennial generation (think of all the talk of dopamine and serotonin on tumblr in 2012). There are a lot of appeals to scientific authority that people hold very strongly to. The ADHD subreddit for instance implies the social model of disability is a \"conspiracy theory\" in the rules, which is actually a fairly extreme stance.   \n\n\n  \nCPTSD people (and I'm one myself) tend to be... on the more esoteric side. It's a more holistic framework, with talks of bodies keeping the score, inner children, people being self-diagnosed, people critical of psychiatry, \"flamboyant\" figures like Gabor Mat\u00e9, etc. It is also not particularly \"psychiatric\" in nature, and places a lot of value on environment and individual psychology vs. chemical imbalances.

I would try to focus on it in stuff I was looking at in the world around me, even if I wasn't drawing. Just noticing the shapes of shadows, highlights, and the midtones between them. I feel like the biggest progress happens in your eye rather than any kind of technique. Being able to really *see* these shapes that make up the images I saw turned out to be the key. Starting with simple shapes in black and white (first thing I drew was a white teacup lit from the side) and then increasing in complexity.\n\nMy drawings also started to look a lot better when I tried to max out the range between dark and light. Beginners tend to stay in the middle and leave everything more gray, so when you try to push the darkest darks all the way to black and the brightest lights all the way to white, and then really explore the subtle differences in the grays in between, they pop a lot more. You can see this comparing the first drawing to the second. The first one has a much narrower range and fewer values, the second one uses the full range and subtle transitions between them.\n\nI didn't \"practice\" all that much the way some people do with their draw every day challenges etc. I took it slow and would just try to draw one piece every couple of months and really push myself to try and get the shapes and value right. I chose subjects I cared about to motivate myself which I think helped (the guy in this picture is my late grandfather for example). The first pic was actually like four months in and at the time I thought it was huge progress because I started at stick figure level. Again you can improve a lot passively if you focus on seeing.\n\nAs far as portraits specifically, like getting the likeness/face right, that's its own skill that was really hard for me. I mostly watched a couple of youtube tutorials. No one in particular stood out to me, I would just take bits and pieces here and there, but if you type in \"charcoal portrait tutorial\" you will find many that are good enough. You can see how other people do it and try to copy their process. Forcing myself to take my time and measure out the positions of the big features (like here's roughly where the mouth is, the nose, the eye sockets) before trying to shade them and fill in the details made a big difference. This is the first time I've drawn a person that's actually turned out to look like the person lol.\n\nOh and when it came to charcoal, I learned to focus on treating it like sculpture almost. Smearing out big blocks and then carving in the details with the eraser and tortillon afterwards (getting a small mechanical eraser was a huge upgrade for this!) rather than trying to draw them in precisely like with pen or pencil. You can see the youtube guys doing this as well a lot of the time.\n\n**tl;dr Practice. Focusing on value.

I\u2019m moving in with my partner in a month and I\u2019m trying to prepare for it. I\u2019ll just go through some examples of things I\u2019ve been working on. \n\n\nFirst and foremost the biggest thing is that she understands my issues and how this has the potential to be a big stressor for me, and is onboard with supporting me through it and creating a space that feels like both of ours. I cannot stress enough how huge this is. The last person I lived with took \u201chey this is something that might be hard for me\u201d very badly (got personally offended and really mean, basically acted the opposite of how I needed). That I have been able to open the channels of communication around it well ahead of time and they are well received basically creates a foundation of safety that historically has not been there before. \n\n\nFor me, there are a lot of things revolving around feeling trapped and not being able to take up space of my own. Historically/culturally (my past + gender norm stuff) my mental concept of \u201cmoving in together\u201d has always been \u201cthis is something you do to keep your partner happy even though you don\u2019t want to do it, and basically you give up your space to move into their place and get rid of all your stuff.\u201d So you can see how there is a lot of baggage that doesn\u2019t mix well around this. We\u2019re basically working to establish firmly that this is *not* the case.\n\n\nWe have set it up so that we will have separate bedrooms (not that we can\u2019t sleep together, just that we still have rooms of our own to use when we want), and she\u2019s doing a really good job of reminding me and encouraging me to feel like it\u2019s equally my space, that I get to make decisions, that I\u2019m allowed to take up space and make a home of my own. And, most importantly, we also agreed at one point that if it doesn\u2019t work out we can take a step back into living separately and it won\u2019t end the relationship. I don\u2019t anticipate this happening but having the option is a huge relief. \n\n\nMy partner can really start to RUSH when she gets stressed or excited, which is unfortunately a bad trigger for me. I can feel really overwhelmed and not considered when she gets like that. So I have had to ask to pump the brakes on certain things. For example, we have seen the place one time for 30 minutes, she has a good visual memory and I do not, so she started hurriedly planning the layout and buying furniture and stuff and I was like \u201chey this is stressing me out and I need to take this more slowly and get to know the place a bit before making decisions like this.\u201d That might seem like a small thing but it was actually a huge moment for me to advocate for that as well as have her respect it. I\u2019m trying to build a foundation of this exact kind of thing, communicating and respecting boundaries. It\u2019s both reassuring/healing and practical. \n\n\nAlso, something I\u2019m doing for me is just having an escape plan. It might sound insane or \u201ccommitment phobic\u201d to someone without PTSD but to me part of feeling safe committing is reminding myself that I have the choice to leave and feeling secure in my ability to do so. So I have money set aside and a plan for leaving and reestablishing a place of my own if I need to. I really need to know that this is a choice and not something happening to me that I\u2019m trapped in, that either way is not life ending.

Personally, for example, I benefited a lot more from a trauma-informed humanistic/relational (sometimes called Rogerian) approach than a cognitive-behavioral approach, but it's different for different people. Sometimes it just comes down to the individual therapist and how well they can \"see\" what is going on with you. Therapists can sometimes simply be a bad fit for a given person. Again, this is a well known issue in seeking mental health treatment and I suspect if you were on any other sub describing an issue not associated with \"entitlement\" or \"victim mentality\"  people would be a lot more sympathetic to your assessment that things aren't right.\n\nIf you go on psychologytoday and shop around various therapists in your area, you can see the key words and issues they describe specializing in, maybe look up what they mean and compare. It would also be helpful to really nail down and try to articulate what isn't working currently (of course, make a good faith effort to express all this to your current therapist too) so you can address these concerns. Most therapists offer a free brief consultation to help you assess whether or not they're right for you. Lastly, if you are really struggling with social interaction in general being painful, it may be good to find someone who specializes in that (depending on how bad it is, someone with special needs experience could help a lot).", "created_utc": "1658628236.0", "edited": "1658628499.0", "id": "ihec4cg", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_w6eu99", "parent_id": "t1_ihe7c5w", "score": "0", "subreddit": "IncelExit", "subreddit_id": "t5_26rn4p"}, {"author": "pdawes", "body": "In answer to your question YES there are different types of therapy.\n\n\nHonestly that particular therapist sounds like a bad fit. There is a school of therapy that focuses on behavioral solutions (i.e. telling you what to do) and \u201cjust think positive\u201d which can be helpful for some people and utterly remedial or like unsolicited advice for others. All therapy is not like that; it\u2019s just one of the big types (of which there are like 5). I myself had an extremely unhelpful therapist in this vein on my first try. It honestly made my problems worse to not be heard and constantly have someone minimize them to try to push me into action I\u2019d tried already. He was also very insistent that \u201cthis is just what therapy is\u201d (Not true!) when I complained about the approach not working. The second therapist I found was much better and has delivered real and lasting change, but I had to put a lot of work into searching to find someone who I felt was actually going to address my problems. The process can be really hard and frustrating for anybody. It is known to be.\n\n\nPosters should not be shitting on you for trying to find adequate care, something you have a right to as much as anyone else. I think some of the replies here (including the \u201ctough love\u201d top comment from a mod) are very unfair to you and counterproductive. Some of the attitudes expressed sound like a variation of \u201cman up!\u201d which is really disheartening to see on a support sub for struggling men. I am kinda mad on your behalf. \n\n\n\nIt sounds like you are looking for someone to help you unpack and break down how to relate and connect with others, rather than someone to help you to simply come up with an action plan to meet more people. You also mention what appear to be some core problems with discomfort and difficulty around socializing itself. If your therapist is not helping you explore these and your relationship to yourself, but instead just pushing you to \u201cjust do it!\u201d to me that sounds like a doctor telling someone who came in with a broken arm to do push ups. That sounds like deep issues not being addressed, and instead minimized and ignored in favor of \u201csolutions\u201d you may not have even asked for.  \n\n\nThe helpful thing about seeking out a new therapist is you can tell them what didn\u2019t work about your last therapist. You can even share your post. With experience you will be able to narrow down what you need and better advocate for therapeutic approaches that work for you and the process will get easier and more efficient.

It does not seem to account for people who take \\*too much\\* responsibility or carry \\*too much\\* shame very carefully. It felt very much like echoes of these \"man up and take responsibility!\" voices I've heard all of my life. It is not inherent to the model, but I think (and have seen personally) that people can use the kind of 12-step focus on self-discipline as a way to repress and abuse themselves.\n\nIn the book Adult Children of Emotionally Immature Parents there's this concept of internalizers vs. externalizers. The rough summary being: some people (internalizers) predominantly take the messages of a less than nurturing upbringing and the shortcomings of their caregivers as an internal problem with them. Your toxic shame and inner critic type stuff. Others (externalizers) predominantly form it into a sense of conflict and persecution from the world at large, take their stuff out on other people to avoid looking within, or get caught up in addictions seeking resolution to inner pain from the outside world etc. (And of course, the whole thing is not binary, we're all probably different mixes of both in different domains). The author argues, and I think I agree, that 12 step programs are designed, for the most part, to turn externalizers more into internalizers.\n\nSo if you're more on the side of being an internalizer (guilty, shameful, self-abandoning, makes excuses for other people etc.) to me, the tone of 12-step stuff doesn't play well with that. The model is designed to get addicts to stop making excuses and tackle their own problems, with a focus on their role in creating them. Sometimes people need validation and context to understand that they were in fact abused, that the blame isn't all on them, that kind of thing. It's hard to get that in 12-step culture; you're more likely to get \"stop being a victim and focus on taking action!\" But some chapters handle it better than others. I don't think is a given so much as something that can happen and is important to name. It was very much my experience in CODA. Even with CODA or ACoA or Al-Anon which are focused around dealing with abuse and empowering people to create boundaries, there is still this flavor of \"realize that you are the problem\" which is like, technically empirically true in a real way but also can be not the truth you need to hear. IMO, it gets victim-blamey very quickly, and can sidestep a lot of the important work of healthy blame and grief.\n\n However, the best book I've read on boundaries (and the role of healthy vs toxic shame) is called Facing Codependence by Pia Mellody. It is quite 12-steppy and IMO hits the balance well.

I guess I thought of it like describing \"depression and anxiety\" was like talking about \"cough and fever\" and the deeper stuff was going in and removing the \"infection\" that was generating them. It's a question of are you looking to \"reduce sensations of cough and fever\" or are you after something else?\n\nKnowing the cause per se might actually be fairly irrelevant but there is something to be gained from understanding the past, even if it's just recognizing patterns. Personally, I think a lot of the benefit of therapy is somewhat intangible and comes from vulnerability. Sharing the hurt parts of yourself, if you will, with someone you can feel safe entrusting with your care. It seems to do something interpersonal for people that helps them regulate themselves and resolve deeper issues. This is a widely observed phenomenon but it's closely related to the placebo effect (not a bad thing because therapy is not a pill) so there aren't many randomized clinical trials for \"twelve weeks of secure therapeutic relationship\" the way there are for a manualized approach like CBT (and yes this also does have the advantage of showing symptom reduction in shorter timeframes, which is demonstrated by robust evidence over and over again).

CBT felt minimizing, invalidating, remedial (again, reminded me of what I could learn for free on youtube), and extremely shallow. For other people, they may really need someone to tell them actions they can take that are backed by clinical trials to make them feel less anxiety or whatever. I don't mean to minimize that either; if people are debilitated with panic attacks every day this is exactly what they need.

I have come to understand it as a part of a flight response that grips me when I feel trapped or neglected (i.e. unmet needs in the relationship). When I feel sufficiently bad I start to have these fantasies of leaving or like allowing myself to feel what life after breaking up would be like, and it can bring that sense of relief and empowerment (a great way to put it). I usually end up feeling confused, like \"oh shit I don't know what I want,\" and if it's sufficiently bad I can write up all the prior good feelings I had about wanting to be in the relationship as me having been tricked, or fooling myself. I also get a sense of urgency like I need to tunnel down, write down what I feel, look things up, look in my journals for patterns, and FIGURE IT OUT now.\n\nThere can also be critical thoughts *towards myself* \"I'm wasting my/our time and missing out on what I really want. I have way more issues with being codependent than I realized and I'm letting myself get sucked into something I never wanted.\" or *towards partner* \"she's actually a totally different kind of person, not who she said she was, and stringing me along with excuses and promises of change just like my abusive exes\" or *both* \"and here I am once again falling for some shitty person's excuses and repeating the cycle.\"\n\nLike you, I started to struggle with which feelings were \"real\" and which were \"fake.\" (I think it's important to remember that all feelings are real and worthy of being explored, but I know what you mean). The question is which is the one that informs the course of action I actually want to take, and which is downstream of my own attachment issues. I could alternate between intense polarities of ambivalence (one week I thought \"wow I might marry this person\" and the next \"it was all a mistake I've been duped\") that made me feel crazy and confused.\n\nI've been able to make sense of this by tuning into underlying feelings of fear or urgency that underpin these moments. It's part of why I've decided not to act from this feeling. I made a promise to myself that if/when it's actually time to break up, I will do so from a grounded place of clarity.  Which is how previous breakups have gone for me, which is also important to remind myself; just to trust in my ability to end relationships or remove myself from situations that aren't working for me, and the ample evidence I have of this. I won't feel rushed or ambivalent; I'll feel reasonably certain and know.\n\nI have grown to actually notice in my body a visceral feeling of wanting to RUN away that just grips me. I get this like tense painful energy in my quadriceps and hip flexors. It can taint my thinking process and get me obsessing about why I secretly want to leave my relationship, trigger those alternating inner/outer critical thought processes etc. As I get more in touch with this feeling, I start to notice what actually sets it off. This has been focusing me more on the actual patterns and root causes in my relationship, like fairly strong feelings of being neglected and abandoned by my partner's actions and choices that I didn't know were there (used to just think I wanted to be single and have fun when I felt like this). That gives us stuff to work on together, needs I can communicate and ask for (mind blowing!), and it also gives me clarity about what I want and need and whether or not my relationship is compatible with that. The work I do on my relationship strengthens my will and sense of self, and will stay with me even if I choose to end things later on. It's not a sunk cost.\n\nI also have PTSD so I'm working towards processing these feelings of wanting to flee and being trapped the same way I have with other post-traumatic flashbacks. I have some confidence that I can get to a place of feeling it fully without reacting or getting sucked in, and addressing past wounds that engender it, because I have done this with other things. But I'm not there yet and so I'm still at the stage where it can flood and overtake me and cause me to chase my own tail questioning my relationship. For now I am choosing not to let it drive my choices about the relationship; I have to remind myself it is not an emergency and there is no need to rush.\n\nI'm a littler shakier on this part, but I've come to conceptualize the occasional fantasies of post-breakup reality and the relief I get from them as basically relief from the feeling of being trapped. It's sort of like the ultimate reassurance and safety that the fear wants, and it can bring intense relaxation and expansive energy to my body. If I feel trapped, if the relationship feels \"unsafe\" on some level, the ultimate move is to bail and move on. It's like a nuclear option. The crazy thing about this is sometimes I've actually been able to access that same feeling of relief and empowerment *in my relationship* as well. Sometimes just the knowledge that I'm not trapped, that I have options and choice, and that I'll be ok either way can bring this feeling on. Sometimes a great talk or moment of deep connectedness with my partner can do it. So perhaps it's less about a specific desired course of action (would you be questioning it and posting here if it were?) and more about the general kind of relief a feeling wants. And from there, perhaps there is an identifiable need or root cause, such as feeling trapped.", "created_utc": "1656969006.0", "edited": "1656970217.0", "id": "iev5njj", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_vr3x53", "parent_id": "t3_vr3x53", "score": "3", "subreddit": "attachment_theory", "subreddit_id": "t5_1aynis"}, {"author": "pdawes", "body": "I don\u2019t stutter but I had selective mutism as a kid and when I\u2019m sufficiently activated I have trouble speaking.

I think I am wrapping my head around it? But I've found the ham handed approach of manualized \"skills\" therapies (like my previous therapist) really shitty and counterproductive; it felt exactly like being forced to lie down and die. For me it brings back a time when I was getting most traumatized. I was studying neuroscience and a lot of people around me were studying buddhism and altogether I felt like everyone was spamming this view of consciousness not existing and the self being imaginary etc. etc. during a time I was dissociating the most and ready to die. It was not a good combination.  \n\n\n  \nI am very partial to the school of thought that grief (or \"remembrance and mourning\") is a vital part of recovery from complex trauma. In my experience a lot of behavioral or skills-based therapies, when lazily or dogmatically applied, basically mean rushing someone *past* grieving and trying to force them into acceptance to \"reduce symptoms.\" It smacks of \"just forgive your parents!\" Like even if that is a desirable end goal (which, obviously is highly controversial), it has to happen within the person's own values and timeline; they can't \"just do it,\" and it's actually a pretty sadistic thing to try and push that on them.

If that's a harmful thing for you in particular to encounter because of your history (it was for me) then it can be really daunting and retraumatizing. You can get into the weeds of do I need this or that modality, which is the best approach, etc. But I found looking back that I wasn't really that equipped to do that and it was better to focus on my sense of how I was being treated interpersonally: e.g. \"is this person listening to me?\" \"is this person looking down on me?\"  \"do they act entitled to my vulnerability?\" \"are they taking my feelings of trust and safety seriously?\" because survivors are very mf good at detecting that right away.\n\nYou don't have to have a therapist and you can get a lot out of taking time for yourself to decide what your own wounds and experiences mean to you.

To the point where I have started the grieving process.. thinking of what my new life will be like, andI feel very guilty about it. Every day feels like pain right now.I hate it because a big part of me wants to stay. Just a few months ago I was feeling so at home and so safe. I want to figure it out, and he wants to figure it out. But then, another part of me feels deeply uncomfortable and uninterested when he hugs me or tries to come close emotionally these days.While he has disappointed me, he has remained kind and thoughtful. We have the same values, I love his family, and we have built a life together that is relatively comfortable.I don't know how to proceed. I am so shut down. It feels like this desire to leave is happening under the surface and I have no control over it. Like it's taking over everything and I can't stop it, and I don't know what to do. I don't know if this deeper thing is instinct, or if it is an attachment wound?\n\nI struggle with basically this exact dynamic in my current relationship. Something will happen, some conflict or some need of mine being unmet, and I will basically be like \"Wait a sec is this a mistake? Have I just been fooling myself the whole time? I should journal, I should write down everything I've been feeling and see if I can identify deeper patterns of problems in our relationship (I find them). It's not gonna work out we'll have to break up.\" I feel a lot of urgency to \"figure it out\" and like interrogate myself about what I really feel and want. There's also some implied like, disavowal of the good feelings I had about the relationship, that the parts that of me that want to be with her were fake or wrong or fooled somehow. That the part of me that wants to flee is the \"real me\" that's been suppressed all along. When I get far enough into it, I can start fantasizing about how new and fresh and fun it would be to start dating again, which will further stir up this feeling of \"oh maybe I never wanted to do this all along\" and it just basically becomes this whole obsessive and confusing mess.\n\nI would also have this really awful \"stomping on the gas and the brake at the same time\" feeling where I would have these thoughts and feelings but try to fight them or suppress them or like half express them somehow? It's hard to explain but it was like I wasn't able to talk through how I was actually feeling so they just kept bouncing around and increasing my stress level.\n\nI have spent OVER A YEAR thinking about only this and seeking therapy specifically for it and basically long story short I have come to understand that it is a form of emotional flashback. Any time I think like this, as much as it feels like \"oh shit I've uncovered the truth\" I generally feel really stressed, afraid, confused, in pain... activated. Stored energy coming from my body freaking out. Not grounded. Not whole. When I feel grounded and whole I generally wholeheartedly and enthusiastically make the choice to be in the relationship. I have been lied to and betrayed in abusive relationships before, where I was sucked in and manipulated under someone's spell, so this process of waking up suddenly, recognizing the danger, and running to something new has actually served me well and brought immense safety and relief in the past.\n\nI remember sitting in the car one day, being particularly caught up in this feeling, and thinking back to Pete Walkers 14 step flashback thing (which I'd never actually really used) and remembering the step that's like \"gently say to yourself 'I am having a flashback'\" and I did and it really resonated somehow. Like suddenly I understood that my worries and fears were a part of me but I was still the adult in charge. I went from being sucked *into* the content of my obsessions and fears to feeling a larger awareness *around* them.\n\nI still have \"real\" doubts about my relationship, like concerns about lifestyle incompatibility, whether our divergent expectations for family planning are reconcilable, etc. Or sometimes I have unmet needs that I'm either not communicating or she is not showing up for. There are also things she does when stressed that are not fair to me or our relationship. These are all things that would activate me and they're still there; but the difference is they don't send me into crushing overwhelming existential doubt and fear. I can address them with all my resources and talk about them with her such that they get resolved, things change, and conflict returns us to a consistent baseline of increasing intimacy. Or I can make the fully willful choice to leave, and know that I'll be ok. Trusting that I'm not trapped is also a huge part of this.\n\nSo tl;dr I think the answer to your question is whether you feel hurt/afraid/confused/activated or grounded/calm/in Self etc.\n\nIt's also extremely not helpful when pop advice is like \"well when you love someone you just know, and if you're having doubts they're not right for you.\" Understand that that's mostly memes from teenagers and that ambivalence in relationships is a not uncommon problem especially for traumatized people.", "created_utc": "1653608142.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ia4o5o4", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_uyi8z5", "parent_id": "t3_uyi8z5", "score": "20", "subreddit": "CPTSD_NSCommunity", "subreddit_id": "t5_4qdiih"}, {"author": "pdawes", "body": "I am terrified of moving in together.

What Dr. K does on his stream is basically like televangelism or TV psychic hotlines; it's showmanship with a spiritual bent and a promise of personal healing and prosperity. He leans heavily into his credentials and his authority as a Harvard psychiatrist as he's doing it. This is maybe not a problem in and of itself except his guests on the show are vulnerable people who are viewing him as a mental health resource, a beloved psuedo-therapist, or sometimes just straight-up confusing them for their therapist. One of these people had serious mental health issues and went on to commit suicide. I personally talked to another one who said she felt super violated after going on the interview. Perhaps you can watch these interviews with a critical eye and see how he goads and manipulates people for his own show; it's subtle, but once you see it, it's oily and painful to watch.  \n\n\nHe uses the show as a sales funnel for his coaching program and discord. I can personally attest that his coaching program has (what I would call predatory, but a lawyer I consulted called) \"highly irregular\" employment practices. The contract locks you into a year of working for him or he reserves the right to charge you up to $50,000. Like any other twitch streamer, he creates a parasocial cult of personality where the audience feels like it has a real relationship with the content creator, and the lines between fans, coaches, and \"coaching clients,\" are entirely blurred. But with the added dynamic of people genuinely treating his fan community as a mental health resource. Look at his subreddit for instance, it is full of vulnerable people, sometimes with serious issues. His discord is the same way. He can say it's not therapy all he wants, but people are coming to him for serious help.  \n\n\nPeople sign up for this coaching program because they feel like it will help them with their mental health, but it \"isn't therapy,\" but the coaches were \"trained\" by Dr. K (about eight hours of prerecorded video) and it can maybe help your depression or get you unstuck in life, but it's \"not therapy.\" The marketing for it sort of dances around this line of \"not therapy... but it can help your mental health!\" Coaching clients can be encouraged to donate to the foundation after their coaching is complete (this was mentioned, BY Dr. K himself, in a coach training I attended), which is not yet registered as a nonprofit meaning the finances could just be... whatever, going to him, going to his family, it isn't known, all it says is your donations go to \"help gamers.\"  \n\n\nYou will notice when I posted this, a fan came up to defend him and his \"important mission.\" Last year, I probably would've done the same thing. Dr. K fans are like this. They seem to love him, and want to take care of him. He changed their lives, he really touched them, and it's such an injustice that people would criticize him or come after him. I believe he takes advantage of caretaking and people-pleasing types who feel he has played a therapeutic role in their lives. To an extent, I am a people pleaser myself, and the people in the coaching training program with me all seemed very similar. Eager to help, low-self esteem, vulnerable, and big fans of the stream. As far as I can tell, they all signed that contract I mentioned earlier. He has a multimillion dollar media empire and aggressive lawyers, he does not need depressed 20 year olds taking care of him!   \n\n\n  \nI think the type of grift he does is something that we haven't seen in the internet era; it is much more familiar in the domain of TV. Gen Z doesn't have psychic hotlines or televangelists or prosperity gospels; they have twitch-based \"not therapy.\" I hope that anybody reading this will consider who and what they are interacting with as they consume his content.

Sometimes people shouldn't be weighing themselves for psychological reasons (triggers obsessive eating disorder stuff), and if you're one of them it's ok to focus on stuff like your clothes fitting better etc. But if you aren't bothered by it, it may be helpful to weigh yourself more often so you can get a sense of daily fluctuations and how the number on the scale changes even hour to hour vs. larger trends.\n\nIf you have a family history of thyroid problems, I would see a specialist for that just to be sure. I have personally found GPs to be pretty bad with that kind of thing; a lot of them just order one test (of the possibly many required blood tests for a complex endocrine problem) and see \"within normal range\" in the results and call it good when it's not. I have known many people to miss important diagnoses because of this, where a specialist later catches it right away. And, let's be honest, your doctor sounds like a bit of a dismissive dick.

However, there will also be many others who find it neutral (or odd but not an insurmountable issue), some who could even find it endearing (or sexually exciting... there are women out there with virgin fetishes), and finally, there are actually many women who will be in the same boat of zero experience because of similar or identical circumstances.

There's a kind of urgency and coercion implicit in it. I have a lot of anxiety around not knowing what I'm feeling or wanting so it made things a lot worse. It was much better to do this by slowing down and noticing feelings, of any kind. I wanted a sandwich and I bought it and put it before me, and before I ate it I paused and just noticed how I was feeling.

Often they thought I was doing it to deliberately spite them (vs me simply being afraid) and doubled down on the triggering behavior.

If you meet someone on tinder and delete the app, you are considered \"churn\" from a software engineering standpoint. So like many forms of social media, it leverages your insecurities, and occasional intermittent rewards, against you to keep you \"engaging\" with the app (swiping, chasing likes). I think we actually need to do more to talk as a society about the mental health and body image issues this type of app can engender in young men, who conventionally get raised to calibrate their sense of self-worth and social belonging based on how they're received by the opposite sex. An app that routinely simulates mass rejection to get you to feed money into it can be devastating. IMO it's as clear cut as the rise of plastic surgeries and eating disorders inspired by instagram, but because of broader social contexts about gender and men's feelings (and a couple of mass shooters), there hasn't been enough acknowledgement of this beyond invalidation and shame (e.g. \"just lift bro\" or \"shut up incel!\". This is just the 2.0 version of \"man up\"). It is not real life or even a realistic representation of how superficially attractive you are, it's in fact an app designed to mostly make you feel bad and desperate. It's really important to hold that in your mind as you think about these things.\n\n\nAs far as the studies go; I really empathize with your feelings of despair and not being able to compete. When I was younger and cripplingly insecure, I used to peruse these studies and feel the same way. Now that I am older, a lot more experienced with women (during periods of being conventionally attractive, average, and conventionally unattractive), more scientifically educated, and more critical of information I see online, I can tell you with confidence that they aren't as scientific as they seem. A lot of them are formatted extremely artificially. A \"simulated speed dating experiment\" of 150 undergraduates, that kind of thing. For example, one of my big insecurities is my thinning hair, and I used to see these devastating blackpill studies about x% of women finding baldness unattractive. Later on, I looked back at these studies and they were based on a crude CGI image of a guy's head with varying degrees of hair loss and a few dozen women had to press a button for either \"attractive\" or \"unattractive.\" This is an extremely artificial scenario that's divorced from real attraction and how it actually works. It's like trying to do a clinical trial for which joke is the funniest to people under 30, or trying to write the statistically perfect pop song in a lab. Most of the \"scientific blackpill\" studies are like this. I know because I used to torture myself with them too. They seem really inescapably true when they're confirming your fears and insecurities, but when you're able to zoom out you see the picture they paint is pretty sloppy.\n\n\nAs you get more experience with real relationships, including with women (both sexual and nonsexual), you will see for yourself how irrational and situational attraction is. Even on shallow things like tinder you will see women liking and not liking people for reasons of \"vibe\" or \"style\" rather than idk facial ratios. You'll see people getting into relationships because of diffuse and intangible factors like \"the way he talked about cooking/nerded out about this obscure part of math/liked skateboarding/always asked about my weekend at work was irresistible.\" It's just how it happens, and it's been this way for millennia. It's complex, multifaceted, irrational, non-hierarchical, and we don't have anything close to a reliable way to quantify or investigate it with a rational scientific model. A woman probably won't go for an \"average guy\" simply because when you're attracted to someone you don't see them as \"average.\"", "created_utc": "1650400481.0", "edited": "False", "id": "i5e43se", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_u72ctb", "parent_id": "t3_u72ctb", "score": "6", "subreddit": "IncelExit", "subreddit_id": "t5_26rn4p"}, {"author": "pdawes", "body": "Not as exciting but just blatantly not listening/hearing me on day one.", "created_utc": "1646102495.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hyv2nco", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_t3robf", "parent_id": "t3_t3robf", "score": "14", "subreddit": "therapyabuse", "subreddit_id": "t5_2jlxhd"}, {"author": "pdawes", "body": "I too am in the fawn-freeze gang, and that book blew my mind.

Basically mainstream people see the term incel to mean \u201cideology of radically misogynistic men who hate women and believe they\u2019re entitled to sex to the point where they\u2019re willing to commit mass shootings about it,\u201d whereas people self identifying that way just see it as a simple identifier of \u201cman who can\u2019t have normal relationships/sex because of superficial factors outside of his control.\u201d So when people in the former group use incel as a pejorative or speak negatively about them, they believe they\u2019re talking to a hate group (or it\u2019s a general slur for a hateful loser, similar to how people used \u201cfedora\u201d or \u201cneckbeard\u201d ten years ago), but when people like yourself hear these reactions they think they\u2019re talking about men who struggle with dating and socializing (which confirms their beliefs that they\u2019re hated subhumans for not being chad or whatever). \n\n\nObviously the Venn diagrams overlap and it\u2019s not a clean distinction; some of those guys who are struggling are also hateful and misogynistic. It\u2019s not hard for one to cross over to the other. But in my view a big part of the incel \u201cmoment\u201d is more analogous to proana culture that emerged ten years ago, that is, a culture converging around deeply held body image issues enabled and exacerbated through social media. In 2013 guys on bodybuilding forums used incel all the time to simply mean guy who can\u2019t have sex, but since then you\u2019ve had violence and weird ideologies being associated with that so you get Incel with a capital I meaning \u201cterroristic misogynist.\u201d To this end there were a lot of mainstream articles that did a really shallow internet anthropology of these subcultures. This is why you have people coming on this board saying \u201cwell I don\u2019t hate women but I\u2019m an incel because I\u2019m 5\u20199\u201d rather than guys who identify with Elliot Rodger as their hero. But the problem is that those subjects drive people crazy, and it gets pretty toxic, so it\u2019s even harder to know which one you\u2019re dealing with.\n\n\nIMO the blackpill is an intellectual reaction to try and explain the pain of widespread social alienation, failure to meet established cultural roles due to economic changes, unaddressed mental health issues, the alienating effects of social media and dating apps, (all of these which are widespread macro trends affecting EVERYONE) through a \u201cscientific\u201d lens of explaining that experience as due to objective individual ugliness. That\u2019s why there are so many studies and graphs involved, like the one you linked. \n\n\n\nAs far as the reaction that post got... women are just trying to live their lives and are pretty tired of internet brainwashed dudes coming into their spaces and asking them for answers that largely revolve around men\u2019s sexual access to them. Like imagine if you were on a forum talking about men\u2019s issues like how fucked up the draft was or how to balance career with being a father or something, and weird women from anorexia forums kept spamming you with \u201cdo you think fat women are subhuman?\u201d with some tumblr screenshots about how x% of men would not date an obese woman etc. You\u2019d get pretty annoyed after a while and not extend them a lot of nuance or empathy. \n\n\nNobody worthwhile is going to hate you for struggles with dating. There is a social stigma attached (see using virgin as an insult) but I would put that more in the box of people saying \u201cretarded\u201d pejoratively where even people who do that don\u2019t actually hate those with intellectual disabilities, and moreover there is a general push to not use language like that because it implies that having those disabilities is inherently shameful. I believe people are starting to think similarly about shaming people\u2019s lack of sexual experience, especially since the pandemic has increased the prevalence of social difficulties in young people (Fun fact: the latest version of that study in your post actually has more sexless women than men now). But the stigma is still out there and less PC people can throw out \u201cvirgin\u201d or \u201czero pussy mf\u201d as an insult, but that\u2019s different than a systemic hate for socially struggling men even if it may not feel that way.\n\n\n\nTl;dr: The hate you may get for talking about this stuff online is people reacting to a perceived ideology on your part.

I studied neuroscience and had a pretty big phase of experimenting with altered states. \n\n\nI think when I was younger weed had this effect of taking me out of freeze and into profound anxiety, which sounds bad but also had some helpful effects because it was like at least I wasn\u2019t shut down. But I could have straight up panic attacks from it. These days it\u2019s more purely recreational, makes me feel creative and deeply perceptive, but I feel kind of chronically sluggish and stupid with more regular use. That\u2019s with sativa. Indica makes me feel next to nothing except sluggish and stupid, a slightly more sleepy feeling of normal, similar to opioids.\n\n\nOpioids felt like nothing (thank god). It reminded me of how it felt to be sick and lie in bed all day. I believe this is because a strong freeze state contains an endogenous opioid component and feels a lot like opioids, so it\u2019s more like normal. I would not be surprised if the euphoria opioid addicts feel is just a relief from profound pain and anxiety. \n\n\nAmphetamines (adderall with and without a script) were good at taking me out of freeze and into flight (but not all that scary). Sort of like the normal \u201cget up and go\u201d that people have. But, could be applied to escapism; like I could get very into posting thoughts on reddit or whatever. I never took them until I was much more recovered however, so I don\u2019t know how they\u2019d affect someone more dysregulated. At lower doses the only effect I notice is that my awareness of time is more like a normal person\u2019s. At higher doses (20mg+) I notice a kind of brazen confidence that can make me kind of a dick.\n\n\nBenzodiazepines. Ugh what a trash tier drug. A lot of psychiatrists ought to be in prison for the way they prescribed them. I mostly just felt knocked out and asleep, and then a freeze-like hangover all day. I don\u2019t get how anyone uses this drug for fun, but for shutting down a panic attack so you can rest, they do the job.\n\n\nMDMA felt like being stripped of all my shame and like my heart was opened to healing and connectedness with others. I felt like I was stuck in Self in IFS terms, or ventrovagal in polyvagal terms for like twelve hours. It was profoundly healing and had permanent positive effects from a single dose. Naturally it\u2019s illegal lol.\n\n\nTryptamine psychedelics, like LSD or mushrooms, seemed to take whatever was bothering me under the surface and bring it to the front of my awareness. It was like my mental ability to \u201cchange the channel\u201d on an unpleasant thought or feeling was just gone.  Most of the time this has been overwhelming and horrible, but as an older adult with some recovery under my belt and the confidence to take a low dose (compared to the standard \u201crecreational\u201d dose that was always way too strong for me) it can be interesting and helpful for introspection. I will probably try them again at some point in my life. \n\n\nAlcohol for me is a fun social lubricant in moderation, but the depressant effects are basically a different version of freezing. It\u2019s a drug that\u2019s predominantly numbing and I would not be surprised if more freeze types have problems with it than others. \n\n\nKetamine was interesting. In theory it\u2019s a dissociative but I found that it actually felt more like being pushed into dissociation and then gently being sent back online, which somehow showed me all the ways I dissociated throughout a normal day. I only did a low dose in the form of one of those pharmaceutical troches. Not the full on doses people do at raves. \n\n\nI LOVE caffeine. I\u2019m not one of those people who needs it to wake up and feel normal; I get a RUSH from it every time and I\u2019m a huge lightweight so a strong cup of coffee is like I\u2019m on hard drugs. I think I used to use it to self medicate myself out of a freeze state and to an extent it worked, but not really all that well or sustainably. \n\n\nNicotine is similar to caffeine for me but makes my body feel sick/bad/inflamed.

All the insight and self-compassion in the world (hard enough as even they are to develop) don't seem to end up getting me there. Like I might read about learned helplessness and relate that to my situation, but when it comes to actually unlearning my helplessness, I just end up needing to help myself and do more stuff, and I \"just\" don't end up doing that stuff.\n\nI relate to everything about your post. This part in particular has been a major obstacle for me that I've started to overcome and I've been thinking a lot about it and coming to understand why. I think I will make a larger post about it soon. Basically I've found a lot of conventional therapy stuff about \"doing the work\" or behavioral solutions (barf) or the 12 step style emphasis on taking more personal responsibility and not \"playing the victim\" to be completely unhelpful for me. I agree that they are often harmful victim-blamey cliches. They're like a more expensive version of \"just do it\" from your shitty facebook aunt. I think it's perhaps that they assume something other than a freeze state, or are written for a more willful kind of passivity from someone who had normative ego development as a toddler and just needs an adult-level push. What worked for me instead was understanding and applying a few concepts. I'm still figuring this out but maybe you can see if you relate to them. (Sorry I was trying to type out a short list and now I'm coming back to say this post is quite long).\n\n1.) When I am frozen, I am overwhelmed. I'm not lazy, stupid, bad, stubborn, defiant, unmotivated, in a rut, etc. I am overwhelmed. My system is flooded. **It's an autonomic response to maximum arousal. The mammalian instinct to go limp and prepare for death in the face of extreme stress.** So it's not really a state of not doing but actually a state of being burdened with overwhelm.\n\n2.) A lot of people have not really been able to see this in me nor respond to it appropriately, especially when I was a kid. Basically people thought I just needed to be pushed harder, or worse: they thought I was being oppositional or malingering. So I had the experience a lot of being scared or overwhelmed and someone nagging or screaming at me in response. Sometimes it would \"work\" in that I would become terrified and burn through my last reserves to get something done in emergency mode, which would reinforce the notion in caregivers and teachers that I was just lazy and needed to be \"pushed hard.\" As a result... this has warped my sense of how difficult things are, and means that **getting things done in a non-overwhelming, non-violent, non-emergency way has essentially never been modeled for me.** I made it through school as a terrified A-/B+ student, but as I grew and gained autonomy this stopped working.\n\n3.) This continues in adulthood. People who don't freeze do not understand it. They have no theory of mind for it. Friends, partners, bosses, even therapists have seen me in a freeze state and interpreted it as defiance or hostility. I had a therapist who, looking back, was not trauma informed and thought I needed \"tough love\" or \"just do it!\" solutions thrown at me. That was bad! I am also a man and I believe there is a gendered response where we're seen and raised as needing to take action and be agentic/take charge/\"work hard!\" and very little care or attention is given to our inner emotional states when we're not that way (or at all); so I found that this approach to therapy was like paying $205/hr to get told things coaches had been screaming at me since high school. Gee thanks. CBT and solutions-oriented approaches, where I would \"just do\" xyz action to reduce my internal distress as a byproduct, did not work. It did nothing to address the root cause, or deal with any of the triggers that would lead me to being overwhelmed. It was like being told to bench press on a dislocated shoulder to \"reduce feelings of shoulder pain and stiffness.\" Altogtether, **behavioral approaches were a constant repetition of how I was raised.**\n\n4.) To the extent that Taking Action\u2122 was successful at taking me out of the freeze state sometimes, it could only put me in a different state of arousal (fight or flight). This was unsustainable and I would either burn myself out (fearful student mode) or eventually end up overwhelmed/triggered back into freezing. When I was in my early 20s I got very into weightlifting and metal music and found I could access the fight instinct for the first time in my life, which I thought for sure was the solution, the way to finally \"just do it!\" but it was more of this and largely unsustainable. To an extent **I had never experienced true calm and had no idea what it felt like.** Remember: freezing isn't calm, freezing is zoning out and going limp to anesthetize life-ending pain. A lot of people confuse this. To put it in the terms of this [polyvagal theory chart](https://external-preview.redd.it/WCctl67NNL3vYdvwVtjL9r8jJ5BJBb7M5nqm2cCJURs.jpg?auto=webp&s=404d8990ce8a5aeca24c4ce479327af18bec596c) I had never been in the green zone. Everything that was offered to me was, at best, able to get me from blue to red temporarily. \n\n  \n5.) Therapeutic approaches for me, therefore, have to be a dual strategy of modeling non-overwhelming non-catastrophic action (which includes gentle encouragement and reassurance, not just pushy or aggressive calls to be a Man of Action or whatever) \\[taking me from blue to red on the graph in a manageable way\\] AND modeling and nurturing a calm connected state (which includes the deeper work of grief, identifying and resolving triggers, being SEEN and understood, and a safe therapeutic relationship) \\[taking me back down to green\\]. I have a therapist now who actually helps me, by encouraging me to slow down and just actually feel what's going on. I am working on my emotional literacy by simply journaling three feelings I experience every day (literally three words, then expanding on them with three more word each). Contrary to solutions advice to \"stop dwelling and take action,\" I've found that actually slowing down and getting sad/mad about bad stuff that happened to me (the whole pete walker \"fully feeling\" thing) was extremely helpful as a first step. A lot of executive function has come to me simply after crying hard. I feel like this is actually a controversial take in the therapy world but it was the way forward for me. Not \"managing\" my feelings, but feeling them and feeling worse to feel better.  \n\n\n  \nI realize typing all this out now that maybe it's stuff you already know, or may not be that helpful. But I hope maybe things resonate for you and you can feel more confident in approaching your needs in a way that makes sense for you and isn't overwhelming. I believe that it's possible to overcome the freeze stuff, and that it's particularly challenging because a lot of conventional solutions are not trauma informed, and people who don't struggle with this (even people who should know, like therapists) often don't have a lot of empathy or a good read on the situation. Well meaning people can take the very first steps, which may be milestones on their own for you, for granted. But also it's important to note that the kind of shame that says \"I am uniquely defective and broken/flawed, I am inherently wrong\" is a part of the freeze state for a lot of people, and not an accurate belief about reality.", "created_utc": "1644310589.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hw27j3l", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_smyuzj", "parent_id": "t3_smyuzj", "score": "7", "subreddit": "CPTSDFreeze", "subreddit_id": "t5_5nx20i"}, {"author": "pdawes", "body": "I love that you made her the groomer wojak.

To me this does something to grossly oversimplify (or ignore) human subjectivity. It's ahistorical too. It's like saying \"because we can phrase this stuff in the form of graphs and economic models, history, philosophy, religion, etc. are obsolete and we simply don't need to account for them (and can ignore their ever-present influences on the models themselves).\" Thousands of years of inquiry and rich history of ideas on what a human mind is and how it works and some masters level researcher just says \"oh it's all perfectly represented by this simple flowchart of questionnaires scored 1-5 that 1000 white American college students answered, the problem has been answered by Science\u2122.\" This is a hyperbolic oversimplification, but it's not that far off from how this body of knowledge is created.\n\nMost experts far enough into the academia of any field will always say the answer is more complicated and the map is not the territory, but IMO psychology has a whole thing about trying to prove that it's a \"real science\" at the expense of like thinking seriously about the big picture limitations of using statistics to model reality in favor of there just being statistics at all.

You could also probably experience both, and need to actively work to focus on the former and avoid the latter. I am going into social work myself and I've had issues with codependency in the past so this is something I watch out for. I would say feeling a responsibility to singlehandedly end suffering in the world is extremely codependent. For one, it's impossible, and also puts an unreasonable perfectionistic burden on you. That sounds a lot more like the product of childhood maladaptations (which classically include perfectionism and excessive sense of responsibility) rather than adult values. You can tell by the intensity and all or none nature of it.  \n\n\n  \nI actually didn't really care for Codependent No More and would really recommend the book Facing Codependence by Pia Mellody.

The dream of the redpiller is to be a hardened player with a harem of younger women, getting sexual and material needs met and killing off the idea of ever being loved or vulnerable with a woman for your own protection until you die. FDS offers something similar (leveling up)  but gets into the evopsych stuff about bird metaphors in mating and demonstrating value and the way some of the posters talk about approaching dating or treating their partners is hardened, walled off, transactional.

Basically the latter is overwhelming, and the former is like 3/10 intensity.

Whereas in the past that kind of thing would\u2019ve sent me spiraling and led me to avoid that person for the rest of my life, it was actually very straightforward to apologize and say \u201chey I did this and I think it was wrong/inappropriate and I\u2019m sorry.\u201d The act of making amends was also really helpful in alleviating guilt and shame and regulating it internally.

I'd say it helped a lot. The first therapist had a zero to kinda negative effect (books and groups were far better), and the good therapist has been invaluable and like a rocket booster. Before any of that, I spent a year in a state pretty close to what yours sounds like, lots of endless thinking about doom and gloom that awaited me (including severe body dysmorphia), spent a lot of time either drunk or in bed, work and relationships suffered (I became kind of a toxic partner), people definitely noticed.   \n\n\n  \nI got out of it through a progression of talking to supportive friends, seeking human connection in general, joining some subreddits specific to the type of abuse I'd experienced, and then stumbling upon Pete Walker's CPTSD book which connected all the dots for me (highly recommend). I'm glad I did that before seeking a therapist because I had a clear idea of what I needed and what warning signs to watch out for.

If we can, say, rename Asperger\u2019s syndrome because of its historical associations, I believe we should also listen to people who have been harmed by behavioral therapies and the criticisms they have for the same reasons.

As far as I can tell nobody has disavowed it or apologized for it. The father of it all, John Dalton, raised a bunch of children with his methods and they all attempted suicide. The founding document, the behaviorist manifesto, says essentially \u201cFeelings and inner life aren\u2019t scientific and therefore don\u2019t matter. The purpose of psychology is to control and predict behavior.\u201d Control and predict behavior.

I\u2019m going on a tangent here but in my view it\u2019s part of a larger anglo-utilitarian movement in social sciences to reduce everything and everyone to a standardized model that can be manipulated with the logic of neoclassical economics.

I experienced it in my own way; I missed out on a lot because I spent my college years and early 20s in a really bad abusive relationship, then sort of letting people push me around in other areas of life, living in my shell until I was about 26-27. The feeling of having missed out (and also having fallen behind my peers because of it) used to really eat at me and be a major source of distress. I started feeling this way, plus this fear that I would soon be \"too old\" to do anything about it, when I was about 23 (!!!). I think I only really got over it after turning 30. As part of the process, I took some concrete steps to pursue the things I felt like I missed out on (especially dating/hooking up, and travel), and I had some success then got interrupted by COVID. That was a crushing existential blow for me that felt like a cruel trick of fate. In retrospect, it was probably a good thing; I needed to slow down and I was becoming kind of a shitty person in my desperate pursuit of more fun, more belt notches, more novelty etc.\n\n  \nThe FOMO and inferiority that comes from years and years of built up frustration and loss can become like an unfillable hole inside. For me it was like I needed a bigger and bigger triumph to \"catch up\": it wasn't enough to be more social and date people, I needed to party every weekend and fuck at least 50 women or I'd feel like a loser. It wasn't enough to move somewhere new and try out new opportunities, I needed to drop everything and start over and move to New York and Be Somebody, or I was just settling and missing out on life. When I did start having new experiences and making progress, I would move the goalposts immediately and find ways to make my triumphs not count. It became a grind and it wasn't even all that enjoyable. My pursuit of these things was less out of a genuine desire for them and more out of a way to use them to (temporarily) relieve anxiety and feelings of inferiority, which only ended up feeding said feelings. It's a weird thing to be pursuing fun in the least fun way possible, but that's kind of what it amounts to. I don't know if any of that sounds familiar to you, but it's something to watch out for.   \n\n\n  \nThis sub selects for a specific type of person, and reading it isn't all that reassuring when you feel this way. Guys on here are like \"yeah once you're over 27 your back hurts and you have zero friends and you can't stay up past 9pm and one beer makes you shit yourself\" and no disrespect to people for whom that's the case but I think they're a minority in real life. All of these things you feel you missed out on are things you can have in your 30s or even 40s; often you can even have better versions of them because you won't be doing them as a stupid kid. I turned 31 this year, and yesterday I went out to a concert with my friends and got drunk and did drugs and danced with attractive women (could've taken one home but I'm in a relationship). The biggest difference between doing that at 31 vs 21 or even 25 was that nobody was puking, sobbing, starting a fight, preoccupied with being \"cool,\" etc. so it was actually more fun than it was ten years ago. Same goes for hooking up; people are down for casual stuff at any given age and it's actually more enjoyable when they're more mature.   \n\n\n  \nI could say a lot on this subject, because it really tortured me for years and I've spent the better part of the pandemic processing it. But all in all I think it's about figuring out what \"moving forward\" means to you. It's futile to try and fight the past (see the whole falling behind/triumph thing), but if there are areas that you feel your life is lacking you can pursue satisfaction in them in the present. It is YOUR life and you have the right to choose happiness and fulfillment, whatever that means to you. You don't have to give up on yourself just because of some vague arbitrary notion of developmental milestones. Especially now when the world is kind of falling apart and lots of people's lives are on hold. You may also find that as you're more grounded and appreciating the present, you will think of your past differently; it's very easy to minimize accomplishments and devalue yourself with comparisons to others (and these comparisons are often idealized anyway, comparing their outsides to your insides).

Some people benefit from looking at their past and upbringing and putting their circumstances into context instead of self-hatred and excessive personal responsibility. Often if shame is crushing and overwhelming it\u2019s a sign that someone else has put it on you at a young age, and that\u2019s something you can learn to stop carrying/let go of. Shame can be blame turned unfairly inwards. There\u2019s a good book about this called Healing The Shame That Binds You by John Bradshaw.\n\n\nOther people get a lot out of focusing on their values, or the things they\u2019re good at or passionate about, and really developing them to get a strong sense of who they are, and deriving self worth from that that supports them in the face of things that make them feel shame. Maybe you get to a point where you feel some shame for your inexperience but it\u2019s like a 3/10 rather than powerful feelings of worthlessness because you\u2019re more secure in the idea that you\u2019re a good and valuable person.\n\n\n\nAnother way is to have honest and vulnerable conversations with people in similar circumstances; you may be more ready to feel compassion and understanding for them than for yourself at first. You could then extend that to yourself later on.

If he can do it... I don't think there's really a \"too late.\"\n\nBeing honest, just from my experience, where I was from it started to be unconventional around 23, like post college/university age. I mean unconventional somewhat in the sense of them seeming like a minority to me at the time, but it's mostly that that's when they started to feel noticeably self-conscious about it. That was the only real issue I saw people have, the internal struggles; they got weird about sex and it would put off people who interacted with them. It's hard to naturally flirt when you feel like a desperate loser the whole time, that kind of thing.\n\nI had a handful of friends in that situation and they all transitioned into full and satisfying dating/sex lives over their 20s and 30s (I am 31). I also even knew some women in the same situation. And then there was also a huge range of people who'd maybe hooked up with someone a few times and that was it, which society can make you feel like is a ton more experience, but their entire experience of sex is quite limited to a handful of isolated encounters (often unpleasant or unsatisfying).

There are a lot of people out there who will either understand, be in the same boat, not care, or genuinely not notice if you choose not to share.

The people who hurt me were extremely insecure and did not contain their relationship anxiety at all, and it ruined my life! As a result, I need space, and people coming on too strong feels like bad news (and often is). On some levels I accept this about myself and don't associate with people who can't handle it. I don't think it's complicated or that unreasonable to expect;  I'm like a cat and I need people to be gentle and slow with me, which I am to them in kind. For example, people who get angry if you don't text them back right away I will never be friends with. But other stuff I realize is controlling, like lying or being evasive about how I feel, trying to present a perfect agreeable image at all times. I've been accused of being a \"player\" a lot in my life, and I think it's because my avoidant behavior would feel an awful lot like deliberate push and pull manipulation in relationships. I always meant well and only did it when I feared someone was going to hurt me, but all the same, it removes their agency.\n\nI think all of this stuff is a two way street. You have your one boundary that decides what you let in and accept from other people, and your other boundary that contains what you let out to them. Same is true for the other person. APs have a responsibility to contain their anxiety and not suffocate or control others with it, avoidants have a responsibility to be honest and not walled off, and develop their capacity to say no.

There was a lot of freedom in that and room to experiment with low stakes that I really benefited from. I noticed that it was sort of exponential, like I made one connection the first six months, then a dozen the next, then nearly a hundred the next. \n\n\nI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re working with in terms of isolation and experience in meeting new people. If you\u2019re coming from a place of say absolute zero support networks and relationships and underdeveloped social skills, you may find that your first goals will be things that people completely take for granted. I notice online that a lot of people will offer generic \u201ccook until done\u201d advice from a place of having no idea what it\u2019s like to be socially alienated. There is a depth of isolation that is fairly incomprehensible to average people and the stuff that they say to you can be maddening, like banging your head against the wall. Or they will offer ridiculous advice that they themselves would never attempt like \u201cgo up to people at coffee shops and talk to them and ask to be friends.\u201d COVID might have changed this, in that more regular people have had a taste of what it\u2019s like, but it\u2019s just something to be aware of; don\u2019t get too frustrated with yourself if the things people tell you to do aren\u2019t working.\n\n\nAs far as meeting new people, a lot of people will recommend stuff like meetup.com. This is good advice in that you can meet new people in a low pressure way with a shared purpose or activity (vs trying to hang out one on one with someone and not knowing what to do or say). However, it\u2019s also a place that attracts people who have trouble making friends for any reason, which means that you are on some level at risk of meeting some real weirdos, who may be harmful. Actually that\u2019s probably a good thing to keep in mind generally; coming out of isolation is, cruelly and paradoxically, when you\u2019re at your most vulnerable. Once you have a good set of healthy relationships and a support network of good people, it\u2019s sorta self-regulating and automatic, but when you\u2019re forging out on your own, the potential for something to go wrong (as well as the effort required for things to go right) is the highest it\u2019ll ever be. I don\u2019t say that to discourage you at all, it\u2019s just a hurdle to get over on your journey. The hard part is up front. It\u2019s really important to accept slow progress and that flakiness and even rejection will be part of the process. This can activate trauma stuff and the feelings of doom like oh I\u2019m gonna be alone forever, but trust that it\u2019ll work out. It most likely will.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s also just an unfortunate reality that the pandemic is screwing this up for everyone. However, the silver lining of this is that more people than ever will have interest in making new connections from scratch and empathy for people who\u2019ve been isolated. It sucks but it won\u2019t be like this forever.\n\n\nEdit: also just saw from your post history that you\u2019re 22. That\u2019s super young and will make all of this a lot easier.

You may be suffering from something else entirely, like CPTSD, BPD, OCD, attachment issues, etc.\n\n\n\u201cNarcissism\u201d and \u201cnarcissist\u201d get thrown around a lot on the internet these days, sometimes pretty carelessly. It\u2019s true that people with NPD can be abusive, but it generates a stigma that interferes with them understanding themselves and getting help.

It\u2019s been very helpful to gain awareness of patterns, and from there I can tie it into the CPTSD stuff I\u2019ve learned about triggers and flashbacks and stuff. Like you I fear a loss of self in relationships. I generally really like having options and escape routes and commitments even to small things like a weekly pub quiz can make me feel trapped and like my sense of self is slipping away.

Basically on each channel you'll have the signal path (AC), the power supply (AC->DC), and the actual amplification circuit (DC), and they'll all have their own grounds on the chassis. I think usually manufacturers try to physically separate them out to avoid interference (particularly keeping AC noise from the wall power far away from the signal path). If one or more of them loses its connection to ground then you can have a ground loop develop. You can probably see some grounding lugs in various corners of the amp, ones for signal (coming in from the inputs), ones for DC power (coming from the big capacitors and going into the output transformer), and ones for the AC power (coming in from the wall and maybe to low voltage lightbulbs and stuff); see if the connections there are intact.", "created_utc": "1633821138.0", "edited": "1633822270.0", "id": "hg1eh2x", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_q4tipi", "parent_id": "t1_hg1b51f", "score": "7", "subreddit": "diysound", "subreddit_id": "t5_3a9ni"}, {"author": "pdawes", "body": "Some of this stuff really personally resonates with me, some of it is a different flavor of trauma response than mine but very similar to the experience of others with complex trauma, and I just want to say that you are not at all alone or broken/doomed for feeling this way.

Same thing with guilt which is similar but different. There\u2019s a book called Facing Codependence by Pia Mellody that broke this down in ways that made a lot of sense to me.\n\n\nIf you think about it, kids are imperfect. As you mentioned, teenagers typically go through this period of narcissism basically. It\u2019s actually abuse to demand perfection and adult standards from them because you are essentially punishing a kid for being a kid. if you\u2019re trying to bring your sense of self online after being denied it through these stages because of abuse like that, it\u2019s going to be messy sometimes. Sometimes the unfortunate reality is that the stakes will be higher too because adults are more powerful and the expectations on us are higher. However, the other side of that is that we\u2019re more mature and capable of learning and self-control than those younger stages. So, not always pretty, but not a constant disaster either. Personally, I acted in some ways that I\u2019m not proud of, but I learned and grew from them and by and large they were all situations that could be repaired or amended for in the end. You may even find that trying to consciously strive for healthy ego and self awareness puts you ahead of many adults around you; I noticed that a lot of people with jobs and families and all these metrics of \u201chaving it together\u201d just don\u2019t really think about growth and kind of run around acting like teenagers, to disastrous ends sometimes. So you\u2019ll have some disadvantages but also some advantages and I think it evens out. \n\n\nI have a lot of thoughts that are hard to organize because this was kind of my project over the last two years, but basically to summarize the model in the book I mentioned, if we think of guilt and shame as emotions with helpful roles (like all negative emotions) you can break it down like this: Guilt is your emotion that tells you \u201cI\u2019ve acted outside of my values and need to get my behavior in line\u201d and shame is something like \u201cI\u2019ve acted outside of healthy and respectful boundaries (in both directions) around others.\u201d These are supposed to guide us in acting according to our value systems and behaving appropriately with others (and if you go for the spiritual stuff it\u2019s about that balance of I deserve a place in the universe like every other living thing but I am not the center of it). Guilt helps us self regulate, shame helps us behave well or avoid dangerous stuff like oversharing or taking our clothes off on the bus etc. When you have these feelings such that they\u2019re crushing and overwhelming, it\u2019s a sign that you\u2019re carrying them from someone else who unfairly put them on you as a child. Abusive parents will engender a sense of \u201cyou are out of line! You are bad!\u201d and you just carry that such that you feel overwhelmingly shameful and guilty for existing, for having a sense of self, for taking up a normal amount of space in the world. The goal of recovery work is to disentangle that from your own senses of guilt and shame, and stop carrying them for your abusers. This is accomplished as part of a larger process of learning and repairing boundaries. When authentic healthy guilt and shame come from you, they won\u2019t be nearly as intense but rather helpful signals on the level of hunger or thirst or pain from a hot stove that help you guide and regulate your growing sense of self. \n\n\nThat\u2019s what worked for me navigating this anyway.", "created_utc": "1633198923.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hf4jw0r", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_pzzr64", "parent_id": "t3_pzzr64", "score": "25", "subreddit": "CPTSDNextSteps", "subreddit_id": "t5_39xvlo"}, {"author": "pdawes", "body": "Sometimes the common activity or ritual like ordering/transaction/waiting takes the pressure off. I think it\u2019s a good avenue to practice this kind of thing. I overcame a lot of social anxiety by having a customer service job and trying to have fun with it (because it\u2019d have been so boring otherwise). I\u2019d just try different things out with the people I had to talk to anyway, and it made me a lot more confident and outgoing. I asked because some people are so socially anxious that they can barely get a word out even to a cashier so you\u2019re already doing well.\n\n\nMy preferred methods for breaking ice with strangers (which is something inherently uncomfortable by the way; going out alone takes a lot of courage and your reaction is pretty normal I would say) is to just notice something out loud. Could be something about them \u201cI like your [something they\u2019re wearing/carrying]\u201d or something about the situation \u201cthis line is ridiculous\u201d or sometimes just whatever I\u2019m feeling in that moment. Offering some honest information can elicit it from others and then you\u2019re not trying to \u201copen\u201d a stranger, you\u2019re just talking. One time I was at a bar and a song came on and I turned to someone next to me and was like \u201coh man this song came out when I got dumped for the first time in eighth grade\u201d and then I got to compare stories of early heartbreak with someone I just met and later that night I went home with her. You may find that your instinct is to play it safe and be generic/boring or put on some polished facade of perfect charm, but this is really an attempt at being invisible and it has the opposite of desired effect. Much better and often more successful to just try and be open and honest.\n\n\nOne silver lining of the COVID thing is that we\u2019re all a bit weird now and relearning how to socialize.

Actually seeing this sort of showed me how much BDD thinking and behavior is self harm.  \n\n\n  \nTrying to fix the problem will only strengthen it, unfortunately. The checking and reassurance seeking just feeds the obsession. Thoughts are the food of the mind and all that. I don't really know the answer except to look inward into that feeling of self-hatred; not to try and debate it or reassure it with evidence but to actually experience the emotional content underneath it. There's CBT stuff you can do for the obsessive thinking, but I wasn't really able to start any of that until I processed the emotions that were burdening me and making me do this stuff in the first place. Needed to discover the pain I was trying to run away from by obsessing, and let it go through grief.

It felt like constantly hitting a wall with someone who simply didn't listen and not knowing why. I felt constantly steered away from addressing root causes (something I KNOW works because it had already helped me so much). It amounted to him talking down to me like I was a malfunctioning brain rather than a person with a story of abuse that I want help understanding because I still feel like I am making up and ignoring it. In fact, all the \"future focus\" or \"skills\" bullshit amounted to being told by a professional that I am making it all up with no root cause and I should just ignore it and things will get better. Gee thanks, if that worked for me I wouldn't be here in the first place because that's how I was raised and carrying on for like 30 years.

Perfectionism, pushing yourself too hard, burning yourself out, perhaps these things are more optional than they seem. Idk what line of work you're in but sometimes if you have a job you don't particularly care about, a lot of that stress just goes away and you leave work at work. There's a lot of pressure especially on millennials to make work your passion, your defining Career, be constantly striving etc. and it's so artificial. Very liberating to let go of. Many of the great artists, writers, inventors, etc. of history were boring bureaucrats and postal clerks to pay the bills. They had cushy mindless jobs to support them, that were low enough investment that they could put their energy into their actual pursuits. Albert Einstein was a patent clerk. Tomorrow's great writer probably works at the DMV. I myself was a full time musician and I worked 25-30 hours a week at a boutique grocery store to pay bills. Best of both worlds honestly. Society tells you not to do this, to constantly strive upwards and have your one main rat race Career and so on, but you don't... have to? In fact this can be a life-ruining addiction a lot of the time. If you haven't already, try giving yourself permission to take work less seriously or to seek out (gasp!) easier work. May not be your situation but it's a very common problem for people.\n\nYou mention worrying about money; do you have enough? Do ends meet? Sometimes this is really hard for people to internalize especially if they've experienced poverty.

It seems a little weird to me because in my experience being rejected for superficial reasons is a lot more subtle and passive, people won't say anything at all because they're afraid of hurting your feelings. Kind of like that old clich\u00e9 where people will pretend not to notice your new haircut if it looks terrible. A woman looking at a stranger's head and being like \"ew, no thanks hatfish\" is taking a huge risk that you will flip out on her; that's just a reality of how society is.\n\nAlso from my experience, regardless of what you look like, you don't really get (or notice) looks from people in bars/public if you're feeling defeated. It puts out a bad vibe and people you see reacting to you start to feel like they're closed off and made of stone. I suffered from this exact feedback loop a lot during my early/mid 20s, I'd be insecure and sad and people would look away or not want to be near me; it regularly felt like evidence that I was hopeless and ugly (and not to brag but this was a time when I was very conventionally attractive as confirmed by many people). The mind is a powerful thing. Looking back I have mostly only ever gotten looks when I was feeling myself and having fun.\n\nIdk just some food for thought for you to try out.", "created_utc": "1630904346.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hbrwfiz", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_pibx1m", "parent_id": "t3_pibx1m", "score": "4", "subreddit": "bald", "subreddit_id": "t5_2sfez"}, {"author": "pdawes", "body": "Same thing happened in Ferguson.

One time I was at a party and there was this woman there who is a known abuser and pathological liar, and I watched her navigate a conversation with people around a fire and I was watching her eyes and her reactions as she was lying and long story short I pieced it together that a percentage of manipulative behavior is actually fawning to the extreme. To the extent that I have hurt people I have done so by fawning, dissembling my feelings to please them, outright lying sometimes. Not because I thought \"I'm going to control this person\" but because I was scared of them hurting me and it was all I knew. Very ironic how shitty to people this made me sometimes.\n\nI notice seeing strong negative emotion in other people puts me into fawning a lot because it feels like an emergency (in my family and a lot of my intimate relationships it absolutely was) and I just start instinctively doing damage control.

Like a part of me just starts talking \\*at\\* people trying to make them OK and I'm not really leaving them space to have their own feelings. My last relationship was very bad in this regard, because she had severe ADHD and would go nonverbal sometimes trying to just process speech and it felt to me like she was mad (which was terrifying) and I'd start rapid fire apologizing and backpedaling and it would make her rage at me which would make me more scared of her lashing out again and make me fawn more, and so on. I still didn't deserve to be lashed out at, and sometimes she would just rage at me unprovoked so it's not like I had no reason to act this way, but I can see more clearly now how my behavior would set her off.\n\nOn the other side, I also think some people have a similar reaction where seeing strong negative emotion in people triggers their fight response. Someone fawning or just generally being anxious puts adrenaline in the air, and it makes people have a similar process of \"oh no something bad is coming\" and if they're a fight type it's \"I'm going to use aggression to fix/stop this.\"", "created_utc": "1630616906.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hbd6qyt", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_pgfe0p", "parent_id": "t3_pgfe0p", "score": "15", "subreddit": "CPTSDFightMode", "subreddit_id": "t5_2f0vl9"}, {"author": "pdawes", "body": "I do because I don\u2019t need to subvocalize.

My COVID quarantine was defined by starting a relationship with someone who is healthier than anyone I've ever dated and proceeding to feel really wrong about it and going back and forth for like a year. In the end, I chose to stay and it has been really great (transformative honestly) but that was my relationship and my circumstances that may differ a lot from yours. I didn't exactly feel *unsafe* per se, but I did feel like something was wrong, that I was hurting myself by staying, that I needed desperately to break up with her and move across the country etc.\n\nI think being closer and more vulnerable with someone than ever before can bring up a lot of stuff, feelings of fear, protective parts that want us to lash out or run away etc. One thing that got me a lot was all-or-none eternity thinking. I felt like because I couldn't commit to being sure I wanted to be with my partner forever, I wasn't sure whether I wanted to be with her at all. When I learned to stop thinking in absolutes like that, the answers became a lot clearer over time. Related to this is just generally acknowledging that my decision to be in a relationship or not is not an urgent emergency that needs to be solved in a hurry (maladaptive hurrying being a big emotional flashback thing for me).\n\nBut sometimes things are just wrong and deep down, you know. You mention boundary violations and things getting more intense, and it's hard to tell from that context alone. Perhaps these are actually quite significant dealbreakers, either by general standards for a healthy relationship, or your own undeniable needs. If a friend started to tell me about a relationship with that kind of language, it would definitely raise an eyebrow. But I understand this is a CPTSD sub and things are more complicated.\n\nIn my case, I had to learn that a lot of what felt like good chemistry and attraction was actually a pretty good sign that someone was dangerous. Ironic/sad but it's the truth. I was so used to the whole intense trauma bond dynamic that the more gradual pace of a healthy relationship felt uncertain, muted, and like something was wrong. While I was feeling ambiguous about my current relationship, I had an experience of really hitting it off with someone else who later turned out to be an insane stalker. That was really illuminating for me, and gave me a lot of clarity that I was doing the right thing despite going \"against my instincts\" in a sense.\n\nAt some point in my agonizing, I got this book called Too Bad To Stay Too Good To Leave by Mira Kirschenbaum which is just a series of questions that put you in touch with how you feel about the relationship and prompt you to pay attention to the foundations of it basically.

People shut you down when you try to talk about it or ask for help, and often at some point the only people who will engage you with some honesty and without shame are ironically extremely toxic people who are further into their own alienation than you.

I think bad people can tell when others have damaged boundaries, and then plenty of otherwise okay people will get uncomfortable with vulnerability or negative emotions from traumatized people and lash out.

He employed a bit of cognitive behavioral therapy which I didn't find helped at all, but mostly offered a lot of action-oriented external solutions that I never asked for (e.g. coming up with a new morning routine for me after I went through my abuse story, or giving unsolicited career advice). It felt a lot like being encouraged to bury my feelings by keeping busy, which was very unhelpful because it was more reminiscent of how I was raised than any new information that helped me. It all felt very shallow, and like talking to a doctor (in a bad way) where he didn't really listen all that well or show all that much interest in getting to the root issues, just managing the symptoms. I think he was somewhat trained in regular PTSD but that differs from CPTSD because PTSD more about intrusive memories of an acute event popping into your life, whereas CPTSD is about traumatic upbringing causing patterns of deep maladaptations. In the end, I felt like I kept having to explain myself and having it go nowhere, which really killed my ability to feel any kind of trust or care from the therapeutic relationship (which is so important for CPTSD clients). Altogether, this therapist helped somewhat, in the sense that talking to anyone regularly is helpful, but it was mostly a huge waste of considerable expense.\n\nIMO, structural dissociation is a critical element of CPTSD. Something goes wrong in the formation of your sense of self, and self-esteem. Things can trigger you such that they take you out of your body, make you act out or recreate past situations. A trauma informed therapist actually understands this stuff, whereas a regular therapist might ask you some stupid shit like \"that was so long ago why does it still affect you?\" (happened to me) or focus on very surface level bandaids to deep problems. I think a lot of therapists still do not know any of this stuff, and focus much more on the CBT approach, which can still help, but runs into the fundamental problem of trying to treat emotional problems intellectually.\n\nIf you haven't already read the book CPTSD from surviving to thriving by Pete Walker, I really recommend it. It lays out a very good framework for starting to understand what your issues might be, where they come from, and how to find help that will actually work for you.\n\nThe terms I looked for to find my current (good) therapist were\n\n\u2022 Internal family systems   \n\u2022\u00a0Somatic experiencing   \n\u2022\u00a0Developmental trauma   \n\u2022\u00a0Structural dissociation", "created_utc": "1627330360.0", "edited": "False", "id": "h6mjrmx", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_os0b7s", "parent_id": "t3_os0b7s", "score": "11", "subreddit": "TalkTherapy", "subreddit_id": "t5_39dpu"}, {"author": "pdawes", "body": "Nice dude, go look up median net worth by age. I bet the average 21 year old is worth -$40k or something. You\u2019re definitely ahead of the game and that\u2019s respectable.\n\n\nYou will find that there are always people who will judge you for making choices they didn\u2019t. I think being younger is the absolute peak of this, because people really see you as a target for unsolicited advice/mentoring. When you get older it wears off for the most part. But you are living independently, providing well enough for yourself, have some money in the bank, nobody really has the right to look down on you for your choices. You\u2019re an adult in charge of your own life, and taking the responsibility for all of it.\n\n\nI will say however that your investment strategy sounds really dangerous and unsustainable. Playing stocks on margin goes great until it doesn\u2019t. Even elite traders who have billion dollar hedge funds call it good if they can squeeze out 10% returns in the long run. If you are trying to double your portfolio by adding debt every month, you are basically trying to build a house on a foundation of dynamite. Even if you\u2019re sure about your strategy and confident that things are unlikely to go wrong (which tbh is an absurd belief that has brought down many great men throughout history), really take a minute to do the math and consider how much you are on the hook for, how screwed you will be if things do go wrong, you get margin called, the dynamite blows up etc. Stocks dropped 40% last year out of nowhere.

The whole idea is that your parts are not you but protective patterns of your mind that take over, and the goal is to get them to not take over/blend/merge with you (which can feel exactly how you're describe it) and instead get to a point where you act from Self. I interpret this as a process of realizing/remembering that you\u2019re the adult (and there\u2019s somatic stuff you can do to this effect like sitting up really straight and feeling how big your back and shoulders are). Another part (heh) of parts work is identifying the roles of parts, some are protective and others are exiles.\n\n\nIf you like books and stuff I recommend Self Therapy by Jay Earley which is a manual for doing IFS on yourself, and Healing The Fragmented Souls of Trauma Survivors by Janina Fisher which is a very dense and in-depth clinical look at structural dissociation as a result of trauma and how to heal it.
