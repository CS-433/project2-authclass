Three working class students get scholarships to the most exclusive high school in Spain. I've only seen the first season and I can't remember why I didn't want to watch the second one.\n\n* El ministerio del tiempo - Government of Spain has access to doors that allow time travel and they send teams to the past to make sure the history doesn't change. You kind of get to know the history of Spain and its major historical figures. Sometimes it gets serious, other times it doesn't.\n\n* Benvinguts a la fam\u00edlia - Catalan comedy but most of the actors dubbed their character in Spanish. A family tries to hide the death of the father after they learn that he didn't leave them anything in his will. The show is kind of dumb and the dubbing was sometimes jarring to me. I've only watched the first season.\n\n* Vis a vis - Young woman gets framed and goes to prison. It's kind of Spanish Orange is the New Black. I enjoyed two first season more than the next two.\n\n* El vecino - Light comedy about a guy who gets superpowers. The plot moves a little bit too slow in my opinion.\n\n* Club de Cuervos - Mexican comedy-drama about siblings that fight for the control of a football club they inherit after the death of their father. I really enjoyed this one.\n\n* Control Z - Mexican teen drama. A hacker leaks secrets of high school students and one of them is trying to figure out who is the hacker. Sherlock Holmes combined with \u00c9lite.\n\n* La catedral del mar - The story follows a poor person in 14th century Catalonia.

I saw a letter \"i\" and I think it is only in Ukrainian, so I went somewhere in the triangle between Dnipro, Zaporizhzhia and Kryvyi Rih. **3332**\n\n2. Looks like South America. I couldn't go far in either direction. Found a sign that said Bolivia but couldn't read anything else. I went back to spawn and it turned out I missed a more useful sign with the name of the department (Cochabamba) and the name of the town (Puerto Villarroel). I found the province thanks to it's biggest city with the same name and quite easily found the Puerto Villarroel. Got baited, it was another town. **4890**\n\n3. Looks European. I went one direction and saw some German writing. I turned around and there was a huge stadium visible that wasn't visible from the spawn. Something Arena. Is it Allianz Arena in Munich? Yes, it is. I saw it when driving from Poland to Italy, so it has to be relatively close to the highway, on the eastern side of the city. We are near Parking 2. **5000**\n\n4. I couldn't move too much. It only allowed me to make one move. It is clearly Bangladesh but no idea how to narrow it down. I chose a random location in Dhaka. It wasn't there but the score was not terrible. **4786**\n\n5. It's the largest amount of Latin characters I've ever seen in Bangladesh. We are in the largest mangrove forests in the world, so I guess it's the large green area near the border with India. There is in fact Sundarban National Park on the Indian side.

Looks kind of like Poland but not exactly, so I think Baltic countries or Finland. Found a sign with village names that looked Estonian. I found Veelikse and Tali but didn't have time to pinpoint. **4990**\n\n3. \"Barangay\" so Philippines. There was a map as a background for the sign and I tried looking for the town name or the mountain but didn't find either of them. I initially guessed north of Manila just in case I forgot about the time while looking, so that I wouldn't get 0 points as has happened to me in the past. Near the end of time I switched to a location much more to the south because I saw a name that was similar to the one on the sign and got them confused (Tinongdan vs Tinagong). **3151** I thought I had just lost gold but it turned out that if I lost less than 315 points on rounds 4 and 5 I could still get it.\n\n4. I thought it was New Zealand but the cars were driving on the right, so probably South America. I thought Uruguay and was losing hope but I reached a border between the states and it was Rio de Janeiro and Esp\u00edrito Santo, so Brazil. I picked one of the roads on the Rio side and hoped for the best. Turns out I picked right. **4993**\n\n5. Middle of nowhere and cold. I lost hope again, but went west and found a sign that said Canada, then another one that said \"Welcome to Manitoba\" and \"Churchill\". There was water to the north, so I guessed we were pretty far north and found Churchill. I picked a location a little bit too far west but good enough. **4988**\n\nOverall **22,796**.

There was a construction near a river, so I look near it and find the Eduard-Schopff-Allee stop but didn't have time to pinpoint and went the other direction. **4999**\n\n3. Looks like Europe and warm, so probably Mediterranean. The sea is to the west. At first I thought Greece, but there were French signs. I didn't recognize any of the names, so I started looking along the Atlantic coast, especially in the South. I found D25 road north of Bordeaux. I know that these roads can repeat in different departments, but what's the chance that there is another D25 near the western coast? Turns out it's high, because it was Corsica. **2793**\n\n4. American flags, tall buildings. Has to be either New York or Chicago. I went a little bit further and saw water and the other side of it also had tall buildings, so I leaned towards New York. Then I saw a sign leading to the Brooklyn Bridge, so I was certain. Went back to the start to see the names of the streets - Front and Fletcher. I found the Front Street immediately but couldn't find the Fletcher. I went to the next intersection and it was Maiden Lane. I found it on the map and found Fletcher next to it. 0 meters. **5000**\n\n5. It's Japan or Taiwan. The signs have Chinese characters but also Russian. WTF?! I don't see any kana characters, so I'm starting to doubt in the Japan theory. But why would there be Russian in Taiwan? I looked at the signs another time and the Ferry sign had in fact some kana characters, so Japan it is. If there's Russian it's probably near Russia, so north. I went to the city that is furthest to the north - Wakkanai. There is a ferry and the sign pointed north, so we're south of it. I went back to the start and the dock was narrow near us and wider further away. I found similar thing on the map and there is a river there.

A year before that, the New Glenn first-stage engine, called BE-4, is likely to be in service by United Launch Service, the operator of today\u2019s Atlas 5 and Delta 4 rockets, mainly for U.S. government missions.\n>\n>Blue Origin has signed contracts with broadband constellation startup operator OneWeb, for launches of an undetermined number of\u00a0OneWebspacecraft into low Earth orbit; and with established fleet operator\u00a0Eutelsat\u00a0for a launch to geostationary orbit in 2021 or 2022.\n>\n>Blue Origin recently signed a cooperation agreement with\u00a0Mu Space\u00a0of Thailand involving both New Glenn and a space-tourism business Mu Space plans. But Mu Space is far from being able to sign contracts for either idea as it ramps up its current VSAT network and prepares to transition into a satellite operator.\n>\n>Addressing the APSCC 2017 conference here Blue Origin Director Ted McFarland said the company is still looking for a customer for New Glenn\u2019s inaugural flight in 2020 or 2021.\n>\n>Here are excerpts from McFarland\u2019s remarks at the conference on the New Glenn schedule and how Blue Origin views its role in the most lucrative launch-services market in the world, which is serving U.S. government demand.\n>\n>Jeff Bezos said something like, \u201cAll my overnight successes take 10 years,\u201d which is true for Blue Origin. You look new, but you\u2019ve been in business for awhile.\n>\n>We have been a well-guarded secret. Blue Origin has been in business since 2000. The original idea was to look at different ways to fly into space. That evolved into an engine house. We are now flying BE-3 engines on New Shepard and testing the large BE-4 engine at this time. At our core we are a propulsion company, building our own engines.\n>\n>We also sell those engines to other companies, such as United Launch Alliance, which is considering us for the new Vulcan rocket. And we have entertained discussions with launch vehicle manufacturers around the world. There has been discussion of that potential. This is all Jeff Bezos\u2019s money, his company and his interest in getting to space.\n>\n>We have been through a series of vehicle productions and now flying a Lox/H2 vehicle with a capsule and using it for testing to learn how to apply this technology to lead us to New Glenn.\n>\n>We announced our vision of carrying millions of people into space. That is the New Glenn vehicle.\n>\n>There will be other vehicles to come after this.\n>\n>New Shepard uses seven BE-4 engines in its core stage. Our engine testing facility, in West Texas, is one of the busiest in the world. We have leased pad 36A and 36B at Cape Canaveral. We are building a very large launch site and, 11 km away, a large factory.\n>\n>The vehicle itself is 7 meters in diameter. It is quite large. It won\u2019t fit on the highways and wont go under bridges, so it is built at the launch site and moved physically and integrated at the launch site, hydraulically raised at the launch site.\n>\n>WE have started to build the initial tank structures for New Glenn in Florida.\n>\n>There will be announcements coming soon about New Shepard returning to flight, about our ambition is to put humans in the capsule by mid-2018 and key developments on New Glenn.\n>\n>What\u2019s the current development schedule for New Glenn?\n>\n>We are offering the New Glenn to an initial tranche of first movers if you will, available from the end of 2020 to the end of 2021 for the first, and then 2022 and 2023 and 2024, pacing out for those first five.\n>\n>And its performance to GEO and LEO?\n>\n>Thirteen metric tonnes to GEO for a two-stage vehicle; and 46 metric tonnes to LEO. We are not going to release all that on the first tranche. On our first outing, we will be flying the stage back. We are going to keep margin back so we have adequate reserves to recover the first test article.\n>\n>We will be selling that first launch. If anyone would like to be the first mover on a brand-new rocket, we have that position still available \u2014 nice pricing, by the way. It will be very competitive. Our objective is very low cost per kilo to orbit.\n>\n>ULA is expected to make an engine selection this year?\n>\n>Yes. ULA is designing a new vehicle, two-engine successor to the Atlas called Vulcan 2 and BE-4 engines for the first stage for over 1 million pounds of thrust. it will be an expendable vehicle for the U.S. government.\n>\n>We have had United Launch Alliance workers in our factory for the last two years on this and they are comfortable with the selection process. As soon as we complete our test demonstration milestones and repeatability on the 550,000 pounds of thrust [per engine], we believe they will place the order with us. At that point we will stand up a rate production facility in Huntsville, Alabama.\n>\n>That\u2019s where we will build the series production of the BE-4.\n>\n>Can you sell New Glenn for U.S. government use even as you supply BE-4 engines to ULA?\n>\n>Becoming a government supplier doesn\u2019t happen overnight. There is a series of certifications one has to go through. Right now having ULA using our engines and qualifying our engines into that supply system is a good thing for us. They will fly a year ahead of us, in 2019. We will come into the market in end of 2020, 2021. And at that point if we choose to go into government contracting, it will imply setting up cost accounting systems that are geared to the government.\n>\n>I don\u2019t think there will be any issue downstream.\n>\n>In your view, how many broadband satellite constellations are likely to be developed?\n>\n>We have a signed agreement for OneWeb\u2019s generation two, so OneWeb is here to stay and I believe there are probably at least two more if they have access to capital.", "created_utc": "1508156474.0", "edited": "False", "id": "doftz87", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_76pxui", "parent_id": "t3_76pxui", "score": "14", "subreddit": "BlueOrigin", "subreddit_id": "t5_2y5rj"}, {"author": "hajsenberg", "body": "He called it \"BFR AMA\" so \"Ask Me Anything about Big Fucking Rocket\"", "created_utc": "1508007093.0", "edited": "False", "id": "dod7k31", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_76dowk", "parent_id": "t1_dod6vcp", "score": "47", "subreddit": "space", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh87"}, {"author": "hajsenberg", "body": "He specifically wrote \"BFR AMA\" so it's more \"Ask Me Anything about Big Fucking Rocket\".", "created_utc": "1508006693.0", "edited": "False", "id": "dod78pq", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_76dowk", "parent_id": "t1_dod706z", "score": "35", "subreddit": "space", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh87"}, {"author": "hajsenberg", "body": "He is also a CEO of Tesla and tries to make Earth use electric cars and solar panels instead of gasoline and coal.", "created_utc": "1508006386.0", "edited": "False", "id": "dod704l", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_76dotn", "parent_id": "t1_dod6ugp", "score": "14", "subreddit": "spacex", "subreddit_id": "t5_2srow"}, {"author": "hajsenberg", "body": "Guys, can we please keep it about BFR?
