By that point, you will definitely be able to speak it, and you'll be very unlikely to forget it. \n\nIt obviously all depends on your personal goals, but I think that's where your anxiety (if that's the right word?) comes from. \n\nLanguage learning is really about short-term goals. Focussing on the long-term might help motivate sometimes, but often those goals are so far away as to be totally intangible and seeminly unreachable. \n\nIt's great to have long-term goals in mind (eg wanting to reach C2), but if that's all you're focussing on while slogging through German and Latin grammar, or studying the next 1,000 words, it'll be hard to relate the work you're currently doing to your eventual goal. \n\n> But isn't celebration after reaching the goal more fun than journey?\n\nI completely disagree with this, mostly because once you've reached fluency (which is intangible enough anyway), it doesn't really feel like the end.

Feel free to ignore, I'm no authority on this.\n\n1 - This is a strong reason to choose Japanese over French. Motivation is everything in language learning, and finding content you actually like, rather than just choosing something because it's in the target language, helps a lot with learning.\n\nHowever, you later mention that you're already finding Japanese a slog (especially Kanji). I've never studied Japanese, but from what I hear, Kanji is a must - especially if you're looking to find work in translation. You _might_ get away with it in interpreting, but I can't imagine you'd get away with being a Japanese interpreter who can't read.\n\nGetting tired of it before you've even really started is a red flag. Sometimes it takes a breakthrough to re-find the motivation, but in my experience, if a language is too much effort for too little reward this early on, the motivation just isn't there.\n\n2 - I'm confused by the relevance of this - do you mean that translating/interpreting from Japanese to Turkish will make it easier to find a job than Japanese to English? As far as I know, Turkish gives you no extra aid than English, and may be a minor hindrance, as I imagine more materials for learning Japanese are directed at English speakers. Your English is obviously fantastic, you write natively, so I don't know what your level is, but I still don't see why Turkish would help with Japanese.\n\n3 - This is a difficult one, probably the only way to know is to find out. There are fewer Japanese translators, but as you say, that doesn't necessarily indicate that there's more market for new ones. Equally (assuming you're in the US because you said 'Major' and talk about English native speakers), the market for Japanese translators may not be based in the US. You might find that those jobs are awarded more commonly to translators based in Japan. With remote working, however, that's probably less of a factor. \n\nAs a personal anecdote, my dad is a French translator in the UK and has no difficulties finding freelance work (but has a higher level of education than you as well).\n\n4 - This isn't really true or relevant to translation and interpreting. Most French speakers don't have a good enough grasp of English to conduct business, understand legal or medical situations or confidently write a contract or other important document. \n\nTranslators and interpreters are employed mostly where there's serious consequences to misunderstandings, as in the above situations, and people and organisations tend not to take risks when it comes to them/an employee speaking good enough English. The fact that on the whole, French speakers speak better English than Japanese speakers has little impact on the translation markets.\n\nThose are just my reasonably uninformed thoughts on the areas you raised - I may be mistaken about plenty of that.", "created_utc": "1665229739.0", "edited": "False", "id": "iri9e62", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_xynuld", "parent_id": "t3_xynuld", "score": "3", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "MostAccess197", "body": "I don't know when I first started to notice that I was actually acquiring it, but I do remember a significant point in the journey - I came back from a feedback conversation with my tutor at university and realised I couldn't remember what language we'd spoken in!
