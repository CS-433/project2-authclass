Sometimes we are tired or distracted. In my case I have been really distracted and stressed, so speaking worse is just a consequence.\n\nHowever, I do have some tips to help! When I was sharpest with my English, I was doing some intentional practice. For example:\n1. Training my pronunciation of specific sounds when reading out loud. \n2. Memorising short monologues and saying them out loud\n3. Recording videos of myself and watching them later to search areas to improve and track progress\n4. Warm-ups or daily sprints. \n\nI learned all this with Hadar. I don't know if you know her channel. Here's an example of sprint: https://youtu.be/8D3WCXR32NA\n\nBye!

This is because we have more open vowel sounds and because we add more musicality to our speech, so it is easier to understand pt-br. \nPortuguese people will understand your pt-br rather easily when you speak. For training your listening, I would suggest you switch from time to time between the two variants. Otherwise you will struggle with the closed pronunciation of pt-pt later. When I studied English I focused on American listening practice and when I listened to Scotish, Indians, Chinese people speaking English, I struggled. Now I listen to all accents... natives of all countries and non natives from all around the world! Nobody owns the language. It is free for everybody to learn and use to achieve his goals and dreams! Play around listening different accents! But for speaking I suggest being concise with one specific accent. \ud83d\ude01\n\nWriting and reading:\nNot much difference. However, some words can be different, so as long as your learn some vocab from pt-pt while studying mostly pt-br content, you will be fine. \ud83d\ude0a\n\nI have a channel on yt where I teach some pt-br.

For each language I have one reason... English, I love it and want to become even better every day until I die. It was the first foreign language I learned. Spanish, I have lots of opportunity to practice at work and this language is fun. Dutch, I live in Dutch speaking part of Belgium. French, it is beautiful and I have always dreamed of speaking French (added bonus, I can easily go to French part of Belgium to practice).\n\nHow? I like to study the languages I have lower levels during the week for at least 30 min a day. It depends on my mood. Usually a podcast in Dutch in the morning or quick check on my book of phrases before bed, and online course of French in the evening. \nIn the weekends, I have calls in Spanish. My English is already fine but I always try to learn something about pronunciation and practice speeches from time to time.\n\nIt is a good idea to study several languages at the same time if you are passionate about them.

Because natives are exposed to the language since babies, they know collocations, grammar and pronunciation \"naturally\" and this is nice, valuable, enriching, culturally beautiful. And actually it could be superfun to practice all this, especially if you consume relatable, fun, cultural study materials. HOWEVER, this has nothing to do with perfection and absolutely nothing to do with minimising people with foreign  accents. Content that says that only natives speak the correct way for whatever reasons and that people with foreign accents sound less intelligent are toxic and are dangerously XENOPHOBIC. Of course we don't need to pay attention to that. We need to focus on the content that will leverage our learning, boost our motivation! I won't even say much about those clickbaits \"stop saying x, say blabla\" when there is no grammar error. I love learning synonyms and new expressions but that phrase to me sounds very passive aggressive \ud83e\udd14.

Pick a topic and without practice, speak about it for 3 minutes, then watch your video and see what can improved. You can search online the words/expressions you could not remember and also write main points in 2 or 3 bullet points. Then record yourself again for 2 minutes and try to say the same thing but in an improved way (better grammar, right expressions, fewer fillers). Then watch and improve again. Finally, record yourself for 1 minute. You will get surprised to see that 1 min is enough to communicate clearly if you are effective and well trained. Sometimes recording yourself for more than 5 min is just exhausting and not sustainable because at the long run you will get tired or won't have time to do proper analysis and work on the improvement/research part. In the end it can be really fun if you don't beat yourself up for making mistakes. Just keep improving and your brain will get better and better. Getting 1% better a day for a year is better than trying to improve 100% in a month and get frustrated. Enjoy speaking and acknowledge your small successes.
