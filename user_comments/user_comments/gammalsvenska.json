There were (and still are) good reasons to integrate them anyways. Both systems have advantages and disadvantages, freedom of movement being one of them (which I have used to my advantage).\n\n> You do know you literally made a point for \"less education is better\".\n\nNo, because you conflate \"education\" with \"higher education\". Otherwise, yes.\n\nYou might want to look around you and see the lack of skilled workers everywhere around you. Skilled workers are not educated workers, and educated workers are not skilled workers. Different markets, and focusing on one of them will cause problems in the other.\n\n> You do not have to set a low bar to \"get everyone to pass\".\n\nIt is. I do have teaching experience, and when the (implicit or explicit) requirement is to not fail people, then you will choose the examination criteria accordingly. (Oh boy am I happy to have left that clusterfuck...)\n\n> Back then when someone came out with a diplom they could work immediately, now, even after 9 months of training most are still incapable.\n\nMy university mostly renamed the diploma classes and assigned them into their bachelor/master courses. So the master's level education was virtually identical to the previous diploma system. Also, I know enough diploma students (i.e. the people who were a year or three older than me) to just smile at your statement. You couldn't be more wrong.\n\n> Also what do you mean with split between high school and learning for job school system?\n\nThe split between \"Gesamt/Realschule + Ausbildung\" and \"Gymnasium + Hochschule/Universit\u00e4t\". As in, people are free to leave school early if it is not for them, learn a job early and work without being looked down. The last part being the most important: In Germany, you are not seen as a lesser citizen for going that route, and it used to be the large majority who did. Additionally, \"Zweiter Bildungsweg\" means that higher education is **not** impossible should you wish for it later in life.\n\nI now live in a country which does things differently, and... I consider that inferior. The German system is a good adaptation to the necessity of covering all your bases, especially in a post-war environment (looking at the topic). However, the way it is currently run is not playing to its strengths.\n\n> It's going south since the bachelor and master was integrated. Useless graduates everywhere.\n\nNah, it has been going down even before.

Expect that bureaucracy people do not know their own regulations! Expect that things take forever because of delays, ignorance, whatever. Expect inconsistencies, because the local population is expected to have all kinds of things you don't have and people might not know how to handle these situations (and sometimes flat-out refuse service).\n\nTry to save up as much money as possible beforehand, not only the trip. Try to get a job (or at least some contacts, to see what your chances are) before moving. Learn the basics of the language. When you are there, USE the local language, otherwise you'll never learn it.\n\nHousing might be a problem. Assume that you will pay a lot for rent. Some cities are insane (e.g. Stockholm), so better assume additional expenses for travelling to any job. Generally, assume everything to be twice as expensive as you expect it to be (you don't specify your current country, so it's hard to compare) - better have some money left than missing it.\n\nHealth insurance might be a problem. Talk to your insurance about how things work if you live outside the country: They may expect you to pay the full price yourself, which may be more than what you'd think. You may not be allowed to register in your destination country unless you can prove your health insurance. When you get a job, this may include health insurance due to you paying taxes, check the local regulations. It may or may not be easy to lose your old country health plan at that time.\n\nBanking might be a problem. For example, Sweden uses two banking systems (...giro), which probably don't exist in your country - which means that you might not be able to pay any bills unless you have a bank account in your destination country (which will cost money). You can pay those in cash at e.g. Forex, but they take a fee is per-transaction and that adds up easily. You might not be able to open a bank account unless you are properly registered - which may or may not be fast. You may or may not be able to get a job unless you have a bank account (many employers don't want the hassle of paying to a foreign account; if it is possible, this may affect the amount of tax you pay and your health care). Expect to be sent around in circles if people don't know their rules. If needed, try to have questions escalated so that people will call you back with a more trustworthy answer. You might need a written statement from your home bank that you are a good citizen.\n\nIf you trust your parents, provide them with a letter of authorization, so that they can handle everything related to you without you needing to be present (helped me immensely with health insurance stuff). Keep strong home ties until things are going smoothly (may cost extra because paying twice for a while). There is no need to stress yourself additionally while having all the basic stuff (language, job, unfamiliar environment, ...) already going on. Think about specific import tax regulations (e.g. importing a car might cost much more than buying a used better car would cost).\n\nWhen you have decided your country, try to look on the internet for forums specific, they tend to know more details.\n\nedit: Schengen regulations allow for staying three months only; try to register early to get a residence permit (and e.g. personal number) as soon as possible.\n\nMy background: Moved to Sweden in 2012 to study, currently employed.
