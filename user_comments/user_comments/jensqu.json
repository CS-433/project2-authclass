I don't really have wide feet, I've never had any issues of my feet being too wide for any shoes and I never have to buy the wide type of shoes, so I'm not too worried about that!

I will take that into consideration! However, I am a bit iffy since they are still around 30\u20ac more expensive (where I could buy them from, and at the same time, not as pretty as the Candi Girl ones, in my opinion only, they are still really cute though!) so I am a bit hesitant for those reasons, but I will consider it nonetheless!
