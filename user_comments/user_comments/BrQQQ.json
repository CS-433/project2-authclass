Then the territories around Crimea, including Kherson. Then everything between Donetsk and Crimea, where the nearby waters were firmly controlled by Russian forces. \n\nLike I said, the loss of this territory was expected.

Russia, just like literally every other country in the world, knows that using nuclear weapons is an escalation in war.

More likely you don't actually understand what escalation means.\n\nUkraine gave theirs up due to the security guarantees from Russia.

Not like right away but rather every month or quarter. \n\nBecause taxes are complicated, the government doesn't really want you to figure it all out yourself. They want the professionals to figure it out. So when you get employed somewhere, your employer hires a professional (e.g. accountant) to pay taxes over your salary for you. This way you have to do almost nothing.\n\nIf you're self-employed (e.g. you sell stuff through Etsy), things work a bit differently. Typically this means you start a business. You keep track of everything you spend (e.g. materials to make the crotchet items) and everything you earn. You or an accountant that you hire will calculate how much tax you have to pay every month/quarter/year based on your earnings and other factors.\n\nIf you make very little money with your business, it may not be required to register anything or pay any taxes. This depends on where you live. Some people do make a fair bit of money but don't report their income anyway. This is illegal. The tax authority doesn't really care if you made $100 last year and didn't pay tax over it. They might care if you earned $10 000.\n\nFor registering a small business, you're typically looking for a \"sole proprietorship\" type of business. This usually means you're a one person (or more, but still a small) business and all your tax stuff is much simpler. Depending on local laws, you may not need to \"officially\" register this. If your business is more complex (e.g. you have employees), then you need a different type of business that has much more complex bureaucracy attached to it.\n\nKeep in mind: there are lots of types of taxes. The taxes mentioned above are about salaries or income of your business. There is also the yearly filing of taxes that most people have to do. That's when you calculate how much income you had last year, how much tax you already paid and any tax benefits that apply for you. That tells you if you owe more money to the government or you actually paid too much in taxes and you should get a tax refund.

You can \"germanify\" a lot of Dutch words and it usually ends up being a correct German word. Though it's not always the word you intended to use. This is how most Dutch people (who don't really know German) speak German.

But the Dutch word is rarely used and most people don't even know it, so it won't help Dutch learners.\n\nThere are tons of false friends. Anything from \"bellen\" (to bark) vs \"bellen\" (to call someone by phone) to \"mit ... klarkommen\" (to get along with ...) to \"met ... klaarkomen\" (to have an orgasm with ...). The list of false friends is very long. \n\nThere are of course many more subtle differences.

Every time you call `count()`, you create a new `counter` with the value 0. Then it returns 1. No matter how often you call `count()`, it will always return `1`. \n\nBut you want this `counter` variable to be stored somewhere. So when you call `count()`, it should first return `1`, then `2` etc.\n\nThere is no easy way to solve this while also keeping it a simple function. You'd have to turn it into a class, object or put the `counter` variable outside the function or whatever. But you don't want that, you just want a super simple function that somehow remembers the `counter` variable.\n\nReact's functional components are very similar. It's just a simple function that returns something that can be rendered. But each instance of your component can be rerendered many times, meaning your function will be called multiple times. And any state you try to remember will have the exact same problem as in the above example.\n\nThat's what hooks fix. They give you that magical easy-to-write solution where you can call the component function many times and it will somehow remember its internal state. Instead of writing `let counter = 0;`, you just write `const [counter, setCounter] = useState(0);`.\n\nHooks are weird because it's unclear how they work.

The same data will always output the same number. Two inputs that are only a tiny bit diffferent will typically output completely different numbers. You can't turn the number back into its original input.\n\nThink about those services that detect child pornography over email and social media. They have a database of hashes of known illegal images. So each known illegal image has a unique number. When they find an image in an email, they hash it and compare the outputted number with their database. The benefit is: they don't need to store the actual illegal images on their database, just the unique number of that image. \n\nPassword hashing is the same. You turn someone's password into a unique number and save that in your database. Now you don't know their password, you just know the unique number. When the user tries to log in, you hash the password they submitted and compare the unique number output with the unique number you have in your database. If your database gets hacked, the hacker will have the number of the password but not the actual password itself. \n\nThe reason why you can't turn a unique number back into its original input is simple: there is data loss. If you have a password \"12345\"  and my hashing algorithm is simply removes every 2nd character, the output would be \"135\". You lost data, so it's impossible to turn \"135\" back into \"12345\". \n\nWhen I said \"unique number\", I actually meant \"probably unique\". There is a chance two different inputs hash to one and the same value. However this hardly ever happens in practice with the commonly used hashing algorithms.\n\nAlso it may be confusing that I say number but your hashing algorithm produces something like \"12e90b8e74f20fc0a7274cff9fcbae14592db12292757f1ea0d7503d30799fd2\".

Using this blueprint, you can create actual objects. So there is one class but a class can have many objects.\n\nIf you had a class like `Person` and you create a field in your class like:`public string name;`, the field belongs to an individual object. So if you have 10 objects of the same class, each object has its own `name` field. It means each object can have a separate name. You would access it like `var person = new Person(); p.name = \"...\"`\n\nIf you would write `public static string name;`, the 10 objects actually share one and the same `name`. In other words, `name` is not part of the object, but it's part of the class. So you would access it like `Person.name = \"...\"`. There is no need to create an object to access a static field.\n\nIf you would do `private string name;`, it means you can only access `name` from within the object itself. So all the methods inside `Person` can access `name`, but any method outside that class can't access `name`.\n\nOne purpose of this is hiding implementation details.

It was incredibly exhausting and difficult.\n\nI went back to my home country. At uni, I chose German language as my minor subject. It was about 5 months of classes almost every day for multiple hours. \n\nI moved back to Germany again soon after and it was a completely different experience. I had no trouble talking to my neighbours, talking to people at the bank, signing rental agreements etc. It's not fluent but more than sufficient for most practical purposes.\n\nOne thing uni did right for me was focusing on practical German. It wasn't just memorizing random grammar rules. We did lots and lots of speaking exercises, anything from going through scripts to doing presentations about subjects you care about. This worked really well for me and was so much more fun than memorizing things and diving deep into the details.\n\nThis is now my strategy with learning a new language. My goal is to communicate in spoken form, but not to be perfect at using the language.
