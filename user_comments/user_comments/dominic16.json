Not only that, 2) Dividing your time means less input overall for every language that you're learning. When you have 100 hours to spend on language learning say for a month and you're targeting 2 languages, the tendency is to divide that time among the two (maybe 50-50, 70-30, and so on). You're better off allocating it to just one of those languages, then being willing to put off the other until later.\n\nAnd also, 3) You might end up mixing the two languages that you're learning especially if the two languages have overlaps or so. Imagine mixing vocabularies, phrases, and sentences, which further slows down your progress. It's better to concentrate on just one language because by nature, 4) Learning anything is often a struggle in the beginning. When you make a breakthrough, it usually happens ONE at a time. Struggling on a problem is often the way to real progress, but scattering your focus makes that way more difficult.\n\nOr basically, for practical reasons, 5) If you have an important goal of learning a specific language, probably because you need it for something (i.e. working abroad, taking a test, etc.), then you don't want to juggle multiple languages at once.
