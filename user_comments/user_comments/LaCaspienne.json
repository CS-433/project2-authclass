Worked on valuing myself more and not tolerating such behaviour from others. I did a ton of CPTSD healing this summer, and this is when I started really thinking about how I was treated. \n\nTbh I knew I had some issues with that. I remember even in childhood feeling excluded more than once, but I assumed it was normal. I was replaced by a best friend at age 12, two years after my family broke, and it triggered me so hard I threatened suicide and murder (at 12 you don't know what that means for real anyway) and this was the start to my sporadic self-harm issues (just to reassure you, i haven't cut in 4 years). Had some really shitty experiences a few years ago with my group of friends (who were two sisters and their roomie) who always said I was welcome at their parties, then proceeded to let me down once saying I wasn't invited, and later on threw another one, saying that they wanted a party \"just the three of them\" but then went on to invite 4 Japanese exchange students and posting the evening on social media. Needless to say I got so upset that I hardly talked to them again, and the best thing is, they didn't get it until much later why I was suddenly gone. \n\nMore recently, around June, befriended a woman on a language app but I felt I had to \"squeeze\" my way into her life. She was the type to post a lot on instagram and having lots of friends from everywhere and I just felt like I had no place in her life, even if we had good conversations about healing emotionally. Things broke off when I told her that she deserved better than being toyed with by her long distance boyfriend, who had been breaking up with her at every argument, then finally broke up just before they were due to meet IRL, and she took it badly. It went away on its own and even if I kinda feel bad, I don't think I want to see her again. We were quite... incompatible in our tastes anyway, and I felt we had a massive intellectual gap despite the good emotional connection.\n\nBut once you start really valuing yourself more, you learn to avoid these people, as attractive as they may seem. There's a difference between being actually busy vs you having to literally squeeze in, or plainly and simply being \"the spare tire\". But tbh it's never your fault that they do that, the problem is about them. It takes a certain lack of compassion/empathy to exclude others like that. \n\n  \n\\> now that I think of it, I'm afraid they'll reject me too at one poin\n\nIt sure is scary when finally you feel included or valued. There is that fear that they'll reject you or abandon you at some point. You can't really prevent it, but you can at least try and assume the best, and rely on what your intuition really tells you. And I'm not talking, like, your anxiety taking its voice on. I'm talking, what your inner voice calmly says. Also, communicating is key. Voicing your fears is not something to be afraid of. On the contrary, it's the best way to weed out any potential issue before it comes out worse.", "created_utc": "1666546355.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ithbun6", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_yb9k32", "parent_id": "t1_ith48hj", "score": "2", "subreddit": "CPTSD", "subreddit_id": "t5_2vvid"}, {"author": "LaCaspienne", "body": "I don't think it's so strange.

However I realized I had trauma well before, at about age 17. But when I tried to confront my mother about having never felt love in childhood, it escalated so hard I just froze again.\n\n3. More of a rollercoaster tbh... complicated mess. As I said, I had that one period at 17 when I attempted to heal, but I was put back into silence. I buried it back. It was one of the horridest, most mentally unhealthy periods in my life. I displayed BPD-like behaviour. Was diagnosed with depression, then bipolar 1 because I got twice to a point I was in so much pain I went psychotic, on the first time with delusions, and on the second with olfactory hallucinations that would hit me up to around 15 times a day. I would feel very disoriented after them (now I think maybe they were seizures?). I completely isolated from the world and hid in my room from age 18 to right now, as I'm trying to get out.\n\nIn June of this year, as I was seriously considering moving to the country I've been eyeing, getting to know, and learning the language for the last 2 years, I thought that it would be actually good to heal at least a part of my issues before I am met with \"wherever you go, there you are\" type stuff. My friend sent me the pdf of the book. I started researching CPTSD and realized it was actually this all along. Since then my recovery has been about half linear... I'm in a much better place than in June tbh, retyping out my diaries I can definitely tell the difference between June and August selves. But at times I'm hit back in the face with another flashback. Now I can feel it and let it go. I know that it's my trauma speaking, not my present, and even if it's hard and exhausting to deal with them, in the end I'm much better-equipped.\n\nRight now, I'm healing my (so far most horrible and flashback-inducing) fear of falling in love... with somebody just as scared as me (19 years old). I have a good feeling about it though. We haven't told each other clearly we like each other, but it's pretty obvious that we do, and we also acknowledge it's early yet to tell if we're a good match, but we both want to make this work. I suspect she may have CPTSD too, and I'm also healing my codependency at the same time.

I have pretty severe trauma related to romantic relationships (rejected over and over again, spent my whole teen years pining after girls who at best didn't feel the same, at worst hated me, felt unlovable, unwanted and undesirable, + the whole ordeal of not being straight, piling up on emotional neglect in childhood, it was awful enough to make me suicidal and psychotic, to the point I wonder how I didn't end up in a psych ward), so it's definitely a massive challenge.

I just loved being awake at night too much. I felt safer alone at night. I could do everything I wanted. I loved being the only one still awake. Had many late night conversations with friends and crushes. I kept this habit until college, but the lack of sleep + trauma + being a teenager made me completely break and go crazy. I was misdiagnosed as bipolar. Dropped out of college and one day decided to shift my sleep schedule to a more normal one for health reasons. I still love the night, but... I hardly got any sunlight and hardly got out of the house at the time, and it was making shit worse.

The thing is, in my country it's hard as crap to change your name. It's not like in the US where you can do it pretty much freely. You have to have a \"valid reason\" according to the law, and this isn't one... besides, you need a ton of justifications that people use your new name in real life and have been for years and years, etc, and without having any irl friends, that's impossible for me. They will see my case and laugh at it I bet. My new name sounds probably too foreign as well. It's from a whole other culture, but I picked it because it fits me for real in meaning and helps me fit in this cultural bubble I'm getting into at the same time. The issue will come when I'll look for work. I'll have to use my \"real\" name, because people won't hire someone who goes by an alias (understandably due to some shady people) and just this thought triggers the fuck out of me. My birth name just keeps me chained to the past. It's like this girl is long dead and each time her name is pronounced, it's an attempt at reviving her, even if she's just a bunch of bones.\n\nI never liked my birth name. Ever since I was little it felt strange to me, like pricks on my skin. Thinking back of my parents calling me like that, I have a very unpleasant feeling in the gut. I quite literally psychologically cannot stand being called by that name. I think that's because I was never referred to affectionately by this name, or hardly. It was mostly to call me to do something, scold me, talk to me coldly and harshly... I associate it with harshness and obligation. A clear memory I have is my mother yelling this name and I don't remember specifically why, but I just remember the way she screamed it. The three syllables hitting one after the other, and I freeze. Funny enough, I have no issues with that name other than on myself, and it could've fit me perfectly if it was done right: it's old-fashioned and peaked in 1902, and I'm a sucker for anything old-fashioned. But no. The way it was used killed its potential. It's bad enough that it feels like an insult when I hear myself being called that way, and had nightmares where my parents still called me like that and I screamed and cried that it's not my name.\n\nI used my middle name for a while (I have three given names, common thing in Europe), but... it just feels bad and empty. It's not me. It reminds me of the extremely emotionally unstable girl I was between ages 17-20 years old. My family still calls me by that name, I haven't told them about my new one and I don't ever want to. My third, I tried to use it as a pen name when I tried to like my country and to write in my native language, but it didn't last. It's empty. \n\nThe name on my passport feels like it's the person I was forced to become, the person that they wanted me to be, not who I really am. I feel no connection to either side of the family whatsoever. Grew up isolated from them because my parents were paranoid about my dad's (cluster B) mother finding out about my existence and trying to see me, and I didn't see my extended family until I was 16 and my parents had divorced, but I was no longer a cute and lovable baby, I was a monstrous angry, depressed and spiteful teenager, so I pretty much hardly have any existence in there. I ended up meeting that granny anyway, but she died rather soon after, and already acted dubious with me (giving me extra money to pay for a guitar while my cousins only got a certain amount, hrrrmmm, not very honest indeed) on the first meeting. Yeah no thanks. I don't want to be associated to strangers.   \n\nThe one that is currently just a pen name (and the one I ask to be referred to when meeting new people on the internet) is my truest identity. The unfortunate thing is that I may have to change nationalities before making it official. I just wish, you know, that it was easy. If it was, I would've already changed it a long time ago.", "created_utc": "1658948358.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ihw0e7f", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_w9japk", "parent_id": "t3_w9japk", "score": "5", "subreddit": "CPTSD", "subreddit_id": "t5_2vvid"}, {"author": "LaCaspienne", "body": "Oh yes, I would.

Then with age I became more and more introverted. I became even a recluse, a phase of which I'm getting out gradually. I also had this thing of intensely attaching to one person, a lot like BPD and their favourite person, but now I don't anymore, which definitely makes me think I don't have BPD like I thought I did for many years.\n\nAs I heal I find myself becoming this social introvert again. Not extroverted enough to be ambivert, but not excessively introverted either. I stopped doing the evil eye in the street to deter people from approaching. I enjoy the company of the few ones I feel comfy with and that's way enough for me. I'm still shy when asking for stuff in shops, but I can hold short conversations with strangers rather fine.

Very common in traumatized people. However as you heal, you will find a better balance, because you'll be more secure in yourself. When you've got a more solid base, you don't hold on for dear life to anything that gives you good feelings anymore. \n\nI'm a freeze-fawn type kinda and used to be like this, but as I heal, I find that I'm much less trusting, while still not being overly suspicious either. In the past I would get massively attached right away, and unfortunately attract a lot of not so great people (some of them weren't necessarily bad per se, but just quite unreliable and often very traumatized themselves and unhealed, so it would make up for some pretty toxic results like it can happen when two messes meet and make an even bigger one). Got retraumatized by some of them even. But it wasn't my fault. I was simply acting out of my older program and still very enmeshed with my mother emotionally.\n\nThen I became a complete recluse and pushed away any trust. I isolated. I was suspicious of everyone's motives. Damn even on the street I would purposely look angry as to deter people from interacting with me. It worked lmfao, but it's a bit of a shame. It was my coping mechanism at the moment though, and it worked. You may get a phase like this as well where you don't want new relationships or just cannot trust people. It's part of the process imo, the pendulum has to swing a bit before finding its balance.\n\nNow, as I heal more and more, I'm much more neutral about people. I can like someone at first and say \"ok, cool, if that develops into something deeper why not, if not, then I guess I'll just find someone else\" and not obsess like crazy over them like I did in the past. I noticed very recently also that I don't avoid eye contact like I used to, and don't do the evil eye anymore. I've found friends that I can trust, also, because I matured a fuck ton and I can finally open myself to healthier things. These people are mostly trauma survivors like me, birds of a feather flock together, but I'm able to keep reasonable boundaries with them. I see where they are in the path of healing: on certain points they are further than I am, but on others, they may be less healed. I help them, but I don't let their issues affect me anymore. I'm also much, much less sensitive to rejection. In the past I would get suicidal over being rejected. But it wasn't ridiculous, again, it was just my older program acting up. \n\nI went on a bit of a tangent, I'm sorry. But I want to show you how it could turn out for you as you get better.

Not sure if he's traumatized himself or just... turned out differently. At the age of 15 (I was about 6) he went to live with his father, who is overall a nice guy but sometimes real obnoxious with his loudmouth, racist/misogynist jokes, I think it's a coping mechanism he inherited from his own father, who was also that type. My brother is not a bad person, but he's just emotionally underdeveloped, lacking in empathy, invalidating, and I feel that I simultaneously love him and feel absolutely destructed by him. I have the adoration of a younger sister but cannot be myself with him, because he'll just invalidate me, he won't understand, and will blame it on my \"sensitivity\". It's torture to even just think of it. It feels toxic, and probably is. \n\nIn childhood already, when I would self-deprecate (which was NOT normal), brother would say I'm just doing it for attention, that I liked being a \"little victim\", \"stop complaining\", \"oooh, stop whining\". In my teen years, in a particularly vulnerable moment (and probably after he said something that cut me to the core again), he told me that I \"love it when people pity me\" and it hurt me so fucking hard that I didn't speak to him for years after. He apparently had no idea this could've hurt me so bad and didn't intend to hurt me. Fun fact, his ex-gf is a lot like me, possibly also has gone through trauma, and I think I know now why they split up, despite still being friends. I think he probably invalidated her a lot emotionally, they argued a ton but somehow stayed together for 6 years or so. \n\nI called him recently to speak about our childhoods and our mother's behaviour, but... he gave me the typical \"move on with your life and don't try to find answers\", \"you need to find a job and a purpose in life\", kinda response and spent more time advising me than listening to me, which broke my heart. I just wanted my brother to be a brother, you know? To him our mother, even if she had a bit of a fiery temper when younger, is a cool person, and was even \"too nice\", and \"too lenient\", and I wanted to vomit when I heard that over the phone because of how I never felt safe with her, and how I was always waiting for the other fucking shoe to drop, and just how no one fucking seems to believe me, and I questioned myself again, am I crazy, am I just mentally ill, or god forbid, am I the abuser? I felt as if he was literally calling me a spoiled kid, even if he didn't outright say it. \n\nHe also said that I was probably on the spectrum and that my father (also abused in his childhood) possibly is too, and that I \"mimicked his behaviours\" of self-deprecating and looking for attention as a toddler. Typing this I feel the rock in my chest/throat returning. I'll never speak to him about my childhood or any other issue again. I love him but... i feel that he will never be right for me.

I considered everyone else in the picture a rival to be eliminated. On one occasion I even fantasized about killing the pet bird and make it look like an accident. Yes, the fucking pet bird, it was that bad. At the age of 12 I went apeshit over my online best friend replacing me. I threatened suicide and murder (of course, probably didn't understand what it implied), self-harmed, and in the end the one who was used to replace me... was replaced herself a few years later. Lol. I was also faithful to an unhealthy degree... I would feel that going with other people was akin to betrayal or cheating, even in friendships, and that I had to commit 100% to whatever I did, because if not, then it would give ammo for someone to use against me later. To me life was about finding your \"one and only\" and that they'd forever stay with you and only you. Now I realize how fucked up that belief was.\n\nIt may be because most of my childhood was experienced between my mother and I, and that I had only one \"permanent\" caregiver to hold on to (dad often away due to army), despite that same caregiver being sort of unpredictable with her emotions and the attention she would give me, and because I was taught to only trust her, that everyone else would let me down. Also, I witnessed her trying absolutely everything to save the marriage with my dad (the \"I want to stay together for the kids\" thing), who had cheated on her more than once, and, I later understood, wasn't happy in his marriage, which makes it really understandable that he preferred to go. Both of them are codependent, and he would prefer acting like a dick to her rather than straight up confront her and say he's unhappy and try to fix things, and she'd fawn and fawn to try and keep him, going as far as suddenly changing how she acted with me for a short period of time, which I'm still kinda mad about because I had absolutely NOTHING to do with their couple issues whatsoever.\n\nBut I think it was also because I indeed constantly felt like the \"last one\", the \"last choice\", the one that is unwanted and has to \"earn\" people's love. I was secretly horribly jealous and possessive yet never admitted it until I would explode in a quite nasty way. As a kid I was apparently a priority, yet always felt like \"the last one\". I was always fighting to be the \"only one\", and I didn't understand until sort of recently (I am 22 now...) that when somebody else is in the picture, it doesn't negate the affection you feel for your person or vice versa, nor does it make them your enemy or rival. What your person cannot find in you, they can find in another, and that goes for you too, and that having more than one close person actually counter-balances things and makes you appreciate both more.

As some others said, you'll find your own family. This is what I plan, myself, once I can finally get myself to move out and never see my family again. What keeps me in the most is... my cats. I won't be able to take them with me, because given the first's condition and treatment, and the other's terror of travel, it just would be too much stress for them. My heart breaks knowing that they will never see me again. \n\nYou deserve better than a life lived in a dark pit of loneliness, sadness, and negativity.

I understand your sister so much. Hurt people hurt people, they say. You can have all the material comforts you want, a roof over your head, and toys to the brim, but if there is no emotional comfort and stability, it's impossible to grow up and be happy. I think that's why kids in poorer countries tend to be happier: they may not have as much material comfort as we do, but they have their families (in most cases). \n\nThat sounds like an awful family system to grow up in tbh, and the worst is that now that we are informing ourselves on trauma, we realize that it's scarily more common than we'd like to believe. I also have a thought... your dad wanted so badly your brother to partake in sports, but since he was unable to, it sounds like a karmic lesson of sorts. He badly wanted a boy, ended up getting a girl. He wanted a boy who does sports, and when his son finally came, he was unable to. This sounds like a massive spiritual lesson about expectations, but it doesn't sound like he got it...\n\nI was also a child that followed a miscarriage. I should've had another brother (around 1994), but my mother miscarried him at around 4 months of pregnancy. At times I wish he lived and I died, or that she straight up aborted me. Maybe she would've preferred to have him over me. He was a male child after all. When I think back about it I wish he lived and that I was never conceived, but it would have meant that I wouldn't be there, crafting a beautiful life of my own making. It's odd, but even when I wish I was never born, I still can remember I am not the problem, or that I am not dirty or bad. It's like a walnut that has its shell rotten, but is still good inside. I cannot really explain, it's weird. I am tied between a horrendous wave of borderline suicidal self-loathing on the outside and a knowledge that in fact, I'm good, I am beautiful, worthy listening to, and that I can make things right, on the inside. \n\nUnfortunately I have little to no support network. Got friends on the Internet but I've stopped socializing irl altogether since I dropped out of college 4 years ago. I went through emotional abuse at the hands of friends as well, and I'm just starting to get a bit more \"normal\". I'm looking to emigrate to a new country but would prefer to resolve at least a part of my trauma before doing so. Wherever you go, there you are. I'd rather not carry too much baggage with me. I know I'll make irl friends eventually, especially as I move there. It's just... not the moment.\n\nI hope you have a good day too. <3", "created_utc": "1656055948.0", "edited": "False", "id": "idj7gdh", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_vigwm6", "parent_id": "t1_idj1ow2", "score": "2", "subreddit": "CPTSD", "subreddit_id": "t5_2vvid"}, {"author": "LaCaspienne", "body": "Yeah.

Always wanted a dog as a kid, but my mother doesn't like them (she says she likes them \"only at other peoples' homes\", but always says that dogs are stupid), and I could only have small pets like rabbits, guinea pigs, and all, before parents separated, because my dad is allergic to cats. But I'm more of a cat person, and while I'd love to have both a dog and a cat so I get the best of both worlds, I'm still afraid it could be too expensive for me to have both at the same time. Besides I'd prefer to have a garden if I were to get a dog.\n\nI did have a dog for a short time, like, a few weeks at most, when I was about 12. We got him from a shelter. He was a border collie/golden mix, I believe, and while I was happy to have him, my mother hated him, would treat him harshly, and my kitten was jealous. He would eat the kitten's food because he craved attention (probably was neglected himself) and I hated the way she scolded him, it just... transpired hate. I remember once in the morning, when I didn't want to go to school and felt especially depressed, and my mother was being hard on me, I said \"at least you understand me\" within her earshot and she took it super badly. I would let him sleep in my bed, I loved having him around, but he was unhappy unfortunately. He would often whimper and lick himself till there was no hairs on his paw, so he was brought back to the shelter. Mother said that he probably grew up in a household with no rules, but I'm deeply convinced he was unhappy because he could feel he wasn't welcome. Looking back we were a good match. But that didn't last. I wonder how he's doing now, he was adopted by another family shortly after.

She'll never admit that like every parent, she probably had a fantasy image of me and that it was broken by who I really am. She'll never admit that all parents have favourites and that she preferred raising my brother over me. She told me that she didn't know how to raise a girl, because she isn't girly, and that she was terrified of having a girl because of how women are treated in the world, but I sometimes find myself wishing I was born a boy. I'm not even trans, I feel very much at home in the female form, but... what if I simply wasn't the way I was this time? What if something was different about me?... what if I was the right baby? Even after emotionally detaching from her the best I can, I still find myself wishing I was never born, especially when I'm not home alone for long periods of time. She is recovering from covid currently and has been home for the past week and half, and even if we hardly interact, her presence is enough to kill my creativity, make me constantly stressed, make me want to distract myself constantly and compulsively, and just feel that every sound in the house is an aggression. The movies she watches. The phone calls (the WORST), everything. It feels like an assault on my senses. I just want to be ALONE.

At this age I was really adamant on trying to get her to speak, but I think all I did anyway was retraumatize myself. Now I cannot even speak anymore every time I attempt to bring it back up.
