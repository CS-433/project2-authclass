I came back to my senses and just sat on the ice, wondering the meaning of life and where I could steal sugar (because of course I had to think about that?).\n\nTwo women finally approached and asked if I was ok and I couldn\u2019t talk (dunno why) so I just shrugged. They asked if I hurted my head (I did. But realized the day after) and I shook my head. They then asked if they could help me and I pointed the shack where I could get my skates off. To go in, you have to climb stairs and I thought they would help me get out of the ice, walk to the shack and climbed the stairs.... they only help me to the end of the ice.\n\nI managed to enter the shack and fainted again on the bench. A woman was there with her little girl who was looking at me, but she ignored me and left a little after I gained consciousness (while ignoring me all the way). I still had to go home and the dummy I am didn\u2019t remember the house beside the ice place was a childhood family from both my parents and I. I was craving sugar so much I almost went to the employee room to steal some. But I did manage to walk my way home without any accident, luckily!", "created_utc": "1605662032.0", "edited": "False", "id": "gco8j8v", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_jw1ca3", "parent_id": "t1_gcnjc1p", "score": "2", "subreddit": "HumansBeingBros", "subreddit_id": "t5_2xh58"}, {"author": "AlexGRNorth", "body": "I know the sign language of my country so yes.
