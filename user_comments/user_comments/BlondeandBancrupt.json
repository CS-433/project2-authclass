I have Polish and Russian friends, who all agreed to that. One polish-speaking Russian linguist friend even said that Belarusian feels much more related to Polish to him. But Russian also had sting influence from French in terms of grammar and lexis, so Russian also moved away from the shared similarities with Ruthenian or Belarusian/Ukrainian. \n\nAnd regarding Ruthenian and Rusyn, those are two separate languages.
