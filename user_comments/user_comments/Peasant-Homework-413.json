First of all, i'm from a palestinian migrant family (3rd gen) and also have studied a lot of Near East politics and history.\n\nThe first thing i want to address is you completely dismissing there being a valid colonial perspective on the subject. You seem to be aware of the British occupation post WWI as the context in which Israel was formed as a state. Sionism was an initiative of european jews and the vast majority of the migration into british palestine were indeed european jews, for the local population, the effects aren't much different to any other colonial project just because the colonizing population constitutes a minority in the occupying power and surrounding territories.\n\nGoing into the Nakba itself, you are clearly aware of the existance of informal hostilities before the proposed partition so you can't possibly believe that such a resolution was going to last and while i am well aware of the discourse on both sides of the conflict, Israel was the one guilty of ethnic cleansing with hundreds of thousands of arabs being expelled of their villages and cities never to be allowed to return. Additionally, the perception of the war as a conflict of ruthless aggressors against an innocent victim is flawed, the recently independent governments had every reason to fear one another as from it's inception the Israeli leadership had the objective of establishing a jewish majority state and there was no peaceful way to achieve such feat, conflict was unavoidable and it's perpetuation was more than incetivized by the influx of the previously mentioned refugees into neighbouring countries.\n\nOnwards you have mostly characterized the Israeli leadership as a passive actor that simply responds to it's environment and various palestinian actors as active parts that act on their own motivation. Viewing any conflict from this lense will make the latter part look unreasonable. Between the Nakba and Naksa palestinians even within Israel proper were under military rule and Palestine was not faring great having received a massive wave of destitute refugees not 20 years before which are also conditions that favour the growth of radicalism within political circles. All that while tensions rised in the context of the cold war.\n\nFinally, after Israel emerged victorious of the Six Day War the intention to populate the captured territories was clear and rapidly implemented (see Allon Plan for example), under such conditions at no point have negotiations really come close to the formation of a viable and independent palestinian state.\n\nI guess i dropped more of a general historic view but as a comment: Palestinian people are not the bloodthirsty antisemites that you think or at the very least not any more than plenty of Isrealis are bloodthirsty racists. Israel is not a passive actor of it's own story and the current horrible status quo has been shaped by Israeli leaders at least just as much as by Palestinian leaders. Right now there is no possible way for the palestinian territories (as in occupation areas A and B) to behave as anything resembling a sovereign state and at some point Israel will have to somehow confront the reality of the left behind non-jewish population that inhabits those pockets of land, even if it conlicts with the idea of the ethnic and religious character of the government.", "created_utc": "1666655546.0", "edited": "False", "id": "itno7hc", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_ycls8k", "parent_id": "t3_ycls8k", "score": "2", "subreddit": "changemyview", "subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8"}, {"author": "Peasant-Homework-413", "body": "NTA your reasoning is sound.
