An antigen is a foreign invader that the immune system recognizes as not being part of itself, such as the protein surface of a virus. In the case of the COVID-19 mRNA vaccines, cells are instructed to only make the SARS Cov-2 spike protein, which is just enough to activate the immune system. But the cells are not given enough instructions to make a full virus, so the vaccine cannot cause COVID-19. Unlike conventional vaccines, mRNA vaccines do not use a weakened or killed virus. These antigens then trigger the immune system to produce specific protective antibodies that neutralize the virus\u2013in this case, the antibodies needed to fight COVID-19. The mRNA in Comirnaty is only present in the body for a short time and does not alter the recipient\u2019s genetic material.\" - https://patienteducation.asgct.org/covid19-vaccines/mrna-vaccines-for-covid19\n\nhttps://www.chop.edu/centers-programs/vaccine-education-center/video/can-mrna-vaccines-alter-a-persons-dna\n\nRna and Dna are not the same thing. Dna contains genetic material and is in the nucleus of cells. Rna is essentially a single-strand copy of Dna that gives instructions to the rest of your cell (it does not go in the nucleus) on how to make proteins. mRna specifically is the messenger Rna, that goes to the ribosomes. The mRna in vaccines contains instructions on how to make a spike protein which is harmless to the body, but resembles the spike proteins used by the Covid virus in order to teach your body how to produce the antibodies that protect against Covid. All this does is let your body react quicker and better by creating antibodies as soon as they detect Covid's spike protein. The only Dna in cells is in the nucleus and a tiny bit in the mitochondria. mRna goes neither of places, and has absolutely no effect on your genes.", "created_utc": "1665201747.0", "edited": "False", "id": "irhe450", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_xy92x5", "parent_id": "t1_irhcrig", "score": "1", "subreddit": "VirginiaBeach", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rzc0"}, {"author": "jayxxroe22", "body": "Merci beaucoup :)", "created_utc": "1665200801.0", "edited": "False", "id": "irhcqox", "is_submitter": "True", "link_id": "t3_xyg82t", "parent_id": "t1_irhaloj", "score": "2", "subreddit": "French", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rd5t"}, {"author": "jayxxroe22", "body": "Lmfao, you really think the govt pulled off an entire experimental study on 300 million people and you're the only one that knows about it?

He also mentioned in one of the tweets that vaccines don't last two months, which shows he clearly doesn't understand how vaccinationd work.
