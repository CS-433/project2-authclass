During family holidays in Denmark and Germany when I was 10 or even younger, I remember wondering what life there would be like.\n\nMy aunt lived in London, I was a huge Harry Potter fan and I felt something about British culture really resonated with me so I kind of made it my life goal to move there as soon as I finished school, and so I did. Lived, worked and studied there for a number of years and I still love it but I don't think I would want to settle there for the rest of my life. I love the progressive/artsy/slightly zany atmosphere of the area that I lived in, the variety of food, and British humour. But the climate, even in the southern parts of England, isn't significantly better than in Finland, the houses are cold and moldy, and in general I feel like a country that's supposed to be one of the \"most developed\" countries in the world shouldn't be so crappy. A lot of things (infrastructure, public transport, services/bureaucracy etc.) are just really messy or don't work. And I feel like a lot of British people, especially older people in the countryside, still have this 'imperial' idea that they're the center of the world and I just find it really annoying. \ud83d\ude05\n\nEnded up marrying an Indian guy and we're now living in California. We're both in tech so Silicon Valley is undoubtedly the best place to be for us in terms of career opportunities and salaries. I was never really interested in the US but I fell in love with the nature here on the west coast the first time I visited. I'm still trying to understand this place and I'm not really interested in even visiting a big chunk of this country but I really enjoy how international it is (even London, doesn't compare!) and the wide variety of different kinds of places this country offers. Where we live, near the coast, it still gets pretty cold sometimes but 95% of the time it's between 10 and 30 Celcius, never really too hot or cold, and it's sunny nearly every day. Almost all locals (people who were raised in the US) I've interacted with have been absolutely lovely as well.\n\nWe tried living in Finland (Helsinki) for a bit but it was during the worst time of the year (September-January) and during covid and we just felt kind of isolated socially. People have their own groups, it takes a long time to get to know them, or they need at least a week's notice before meeting. Cost of living is about half of what it is here but salaries even before tax are 3-4 times lower. And I just can't deal with the darkness right now, but I would really like to give Finland another try perhaps a few years from now.\n\nSome other places I've considered:\n\n\u2022 India - We'll most likely move there for a while at some point. A lot of cities really have this \"up and coming\" feel, there's interesting stuff happening all the time, good climate, amazing nature and food everywhere.\n\n\u2022 The Netherlands - Some tech opportunities, cute cities, bike- and vegan-friendly, not too far. Feels like a cool, less conservative little sibling of Germany.\n\n\u2022 Portugal - Never been but I've heard that it's similar to California in some ways. It would be lovely to be able to stay in Europe and still have some sunshine throughout the year.\n\n\u2022 Australia - I was mostly interested because of my fascination with the UK. Always though Australia would be kind of like a mix between the UK, Nordics and Asia but with good weather. Didn't live up to the hype when I visited, and it's so freaking far!\n\n\u2022 New Zealand - Same as with Australia. Like England but with more amazing nature.\n\n\u2022 Canada - Like the US but with better politics and fewer opportunities. But it's just too cold. I feel like if I had to move somewhere cold, I might as well just move back to Finland.\n\n\u2022 Iceland/Norway/Denmark - Would be interesting but again, I feel like they're too similar so might as well just live in Finland. The inconvenience of moving and learning the language and how things work outweighs the positives for me. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "created_utc": "1662447945.0", "edited": "1662448188.0", "id": "inaajxq", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_x6mj4k", "parent_id": "t3_x6mj4k", "score": "10", "subreddit": "Finland", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qztz"}, {"author": "gragev95", "body": "Kuuntelen jonkun ohjatun unimeditaation Calm-sovelluksesta (Tamara Levittin lukeman), YouTubestakin l\u00f6ytyy jotain.

I wouldn't say that Finnish people are beaming and screaming out of happiness every day but it's more a feeling of contentment.\n\nWe have progressively high taxes but free/very cheap healthcare, free education (including university), good infrastructure and good social services so pretty much everyone gets an equal chance to succeed in life. If you become unemployed or have health (including mental health) issues that make you unable to work, you get government assistance to still live a decent life and to help you get back on track. We also rank very high when it comes to freedom of speech and gender equality.\n\nIt's a small country of 5.5 million people who are quite culturally homogeneous and have a strong community spirit because of our history (we were occupied by Sweden and Russia for hundreds of years until our independence in 1917). On paper it may be a majority-Christian country but in practice, it's a very secular country and religion does not cause a lot of conflict or affect our morals. Especially the younger generation is generally tolerant, progressive, and open about mental health and things like that.\n\nEven after independence, we went through some wars and were definitely not a wealthy country, so spending time in nature and enjoying the little things in life are very ingrained in the culture. In general, Finns appreciate minimalism and don't put a lot of emphasis on material things. Most people are a bit introverted and enjoy spending time on their own. Families are close but people value independence and privacy.\n\nMy Indian husband was amazed the first time he visited that even the smallest villages had pretty much the same level of development in terms of infrastructure, good schools, high quality housing as any bigger city.
