[{"author": "multaverba", "body": "Thank you! I'm doing a degree in Spanish and Arabic and I live in France so there are a lot of people who speak Darija where I live. \n\nI can read and write fairly okay, maybe a bit better than I speak.

Anything else is just textbooks and online resources to learn.\n\nI always had an interest in Arab culture (not in an orientalist kinda way) and I try not to \"romanticise\" it, it's just a genuine kind of curiosity, especially of the Levant.

That means a lot!!\n\n\\> and it seemed you overcame the difficulty of \"ain\" letter (unless you already have it in Gaeilic?)\n\nWe have a similar 'back vowel' kind of sound like in words like 'maith' and 'athair' but it's not the same and isn't considered a separate sound either.\n\n\\> I also have a question if I may, do you speak Irish Gaelic? I once readthat Celtic languages have similarities with sematic languages, in soundand structure, and bunch of arabs and irish/welsh/scots mistakenlythought the other was speaking their language if they heard it from adistance and without focusing, it that true?\n\nYes!! Whether or not it's all a coincidence or you believe the theories, the Gaelic languages have a lot in common with Semitic languages. For example:\n\n* We construct the verb 'to have' in the same way (agam => 3andi)\n* We put the verb first like in MSA\n* We have the equivalent sounds of \u0635 \u0636\n* We also lack infinitives and have our own version of \u0645\u0635\u062f\u0631\n\nThe thing about Irish and Arabic is that often I can translate what I need to say word for word. There are also the occasional few words that are similar - knife is *scian* for example.\n\nI don't think Arabic and Irish are related, but I do think we possibly had Semitic influence here at some point. They've even studied how our music is similar to you guys and at the end of [this song](https://youtu.be/j9XkzKKKY3M?t=151), my Moroccan friend even thought this traditional kind of Irish singing (called Port a' Bh\u00e9il or lilting) sounded like Qur'an to him at first.", "created_utc": "1666547523.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ithewe9", "is_submitter": "True", "link_id": "t3_yblrxv", "parent_id": "t1_ithai4j", "score": "12", "subreddit": "arabs", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qt0d"}, {"author": "multaverba", "body": "C\u00e9ard at\u00e1 i gceist at?
