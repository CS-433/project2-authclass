The o in honours is too long which gives you away as being non-native. The vowel in classics is slightly off too, somewhere between an a and an o sound. \n\nThe other vowels are fine here, but the rising intonation on Russian doesn't really fit traditional British speech prosody. Americans tend to rise at the end of sentences, and many young Brits are doing that now too, but your general accent is RP/well spoken English so it doesn't really fit.

Hardly anyone your age speak this way naturally anymore, so it may come off as a little contrived/unnatural or like someone on stage. Sounds native though to be fair. 'My free time' is a grammar mistake, you need the preposition. Additionally, the stress in 'free time' is on time, not free.

Again, it identifies you as a foreigner. \n\n\"or try to improve m**y** specific skill in one of the languages I already speak\". \n\nAccent-wise, this was pretty good. The vowel in 'my' was too short (m'specific skills) which, again, is typical of casual/dialect speech, not RP.  Also, 'my specific skill' is oddly phrased.

After 2.5 years I passed N2 and now I'm looking to pass N1 at the end of my (current) fourth year. I suppose it's something of success story in progress! 4 years is probably a bit longer than you were envisaging but I would like to add that learning Japanese fluently is a very-multifaceted adventure that reaches far beyond JLPT. Here are some of my thoughts. \n\n\\- Remember that the JLPT exams only test you passive skills. Learning to actually speak and write using that grammar/vocab etc will take longer. \n\n\\- I made sure I could actively use N5-N3 grammar/vocab pretty much automatically. These are the corners stones of 90%+ of the Japanese you'll encounter everyday. \n\n\\- I think it's worth learning to read **and** write Kanji. The 'even the Japanese can't write Kanji anymore' argument is grossly exaggerated. Any university educated Japanese person (i.e. you, had you been born Japanese) will be able to write most joyo Kanji, and read way more. And every Japanese person, during their school years at least, could write them at some point. Learning how each Kanji is constructed really gets you closer to the meanings. For the record, I've just finished KanjiDamage on ANKI (about 1700 Kanji) and I can write (almost) all of them. It's been extremely handy at work as an ALT when writing on the board ;)\n\n\\- Pronunciation is something which is often overlooked, both individual phonemes and pitch accent. I took a 6 month break in my studies to complete Dogen's Japanese phonetics course on Patreon, and my pronunciation really improved. The first time you get mistaken for a local on the phone is a massive boost!\n\n\\- I work in ES and JHS and use Japanese 90% of the time. It's a fantastic way to learn. Children have no filter and will immediately tell you (laugh) if something is off. You need to develop a bit of a thick skin but once they stop laughing and start treating you just like the other teachers then you know you're onto something. \n\n\\- I would recommend the Japan Times publisher and pretty much all their textbooks. Work through them, one at a time, with a tutor. I'm currently halfway through \u4e2d\u7d1a\u304b\u3089\u4e0a\u7d1a\u3078\u306e\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e having 1-on-1 lessons at a local language school. Italki is also useful. Study for 1/2 hours every day if you can. As others have said, you won't access the higher N1/N2 material unless you actively study. It's mostly formal/literary/written Japanese at this stage. \n\n\\- Be very proactive speaking it. I date a lot here and it's been a fantastic way to improve haha. \n\n\\- READ. Read read read. Especially once you've passed N2. I'd recommend a Kindle and downloading the Japanese/English dictionary. Netflix (with Japanese subtitles initially). \n\nUltimately, for me, learning the language thoroughly is more important than simply passing N1, so I'd rather take 4/5 years and come out actually fluent, than rush through in 3 and have not really mastered the nuts and bolts of the language.

Most (almost all it seems!) of the vocabulary and grammar isn't something you'll come across in everyday life. This is particularly true of writing skills - unless you go out of your way to write regularly and have it checked by a native then you won't improve.\n\nIf you're speaking is still a bit wobbly then living in Japan will be enormously beneficial. Particularly if you are able to work in an elementary school as an ALT or bag a CIR position that involves interpretation/presentations.\n\n'Near-native proficiency' is another ball-game entirely. My Japanese is N1 level and I'm nowhere near close to that of a native speaker. The difference between what I can do in English (my native language) and Japanese is vast. You'd need to be living and working (and socialising/dating/reading etc.) in Japanese, in Japan, for the best part of a decade I'd imagine.

I really can't praise the textbook enough. It comes with separate Kanji and Grammar workbooks, ready-made downloadable anki decks (with audio from what I remember), supplementary practice sheets (downloadable), videos related to the topic and **answers to all the exercises** (which AIAIJ doesn't). I'm now at N1 level and feel that Tobira gave me a really solid foundation with Japanese. \n\nAs another poster wrote, it is a step up in terms of length but bear with it and take it slowly to begin with. In the vocabulary lists provided, the words you should be learning are highlighted in bold whereas the words you just need to get through the reading are not. That should make it more manageable. The vocabulary, kanji and grammar in this book are things I hear everyday in Japan and I found the way it was presented to be fun and engaging. One recommendation: listen to the reading audio (there's a CD and it's on the website) multiple times. This will help it stick and will also improve your intonation. Read out loud as well; this is how Japanese children learn to read (\u97f3\u8aad). \n\nI have AIAIJ as well but I wouldn't recommend it for self study. Mostly because there's no answer book. I would recommend going through it at a fast pace once you've finished Tobira for consolidation purposes. \n\nI personally didn't supplement it with anything else, but I literally did every exercise the books/website had to offer. I was/am living in Japan however. Wherever you are, I would recommend getting into the habit of reviewing everyday with Anki or similar. Best of luck!
