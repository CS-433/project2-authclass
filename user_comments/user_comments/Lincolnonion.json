One guestion too much.\n\nI have lived abroad(10+ years) for some time and when I listen to Russian now what I am hearing with a Danish ear are slightly different pronunciations of consonants, people speak fast or slow in a single Russian news interview or entire news morning block.

Maybe it is me.\n\nAlso, about regional dialects - I heard that even through we had the Soviet situation, we should have already gotten different accents in different parts of Russia.

I could mention common mistake for every part of speech that Russian has. I worked as a translator, but I also remember lots from my school.\n\nHowever, as I am thinking now, most of the mistakes are for the **written language**, so in a conversation people can speak fail-free. But, as I would say, written text of an average Russian won't suffer too many mistakes either(especially if they make any reports at work). There are some~~hundred~~ common problematic rules, but you can either say it in a different way or google it.\n\nMany mistakes that are stylistic mistakes and many more of \"It is pronounced in a lazy way and now the written form is different from spoken form\"(new pronounciation standard).\n\nMistakes a native could easily make:\n\n1. Comma placement(I am sure there are a thousand books containing only the rules for comma placement)\n2. Ridiculous \"v techen**ii**\" vs \"v techeni**ye**\". In spoken Russian you can pronounce them the same(nobody will notice). But in a document you need to know which ending to put.I love this misspelling, also because it makes me nostalgic about the time at school with our Russian language teacher.\n3. Mistakes \"\u043d\u0430\u0434\u0435\u0442\u044c/ \u043d\u0430\u0434\u0435\u0432\u0430\u0442\u044c\" and \"\u043e\u0434\u0435\u0442\u044c/ \u043e\u0434\u0435\u0432\u0430\u0442\u044c\". They are pronounced nad\u00e9t\u02b9 and od\u00e9t\u02b9. They differ by two letters.\n\nNad\u00e9t\u02b9 means to put on clothes on yourself\n\nOd\u00e9t\u02b9 means to dress up somebody/something else\n\nSo when you want to put on a hat - it is \u043d\u0430\u0434\u0435\u0432\u0430\u0442\u044c.\n\nHowever, if you say \"\u043e\u0434\u0435\u0432\u0430\u0442\u044c\" it would mean that you made a tiny hat for your hat and now you dressing up your hat instead of yourself. So, sometimes a billboard will circulate on the internet, where somebody made an advert and messed these two words up. I don't think all natives know what is the difference.\n\n4. I, as well as other native speakers, mess up \u0442\u0441\u044f and \u0442\u044c\u0441\u044f - a suffix ending for verbs. These two mean different tenses of a verbs. You can check by asking a special question, but, I mean, I just don't get it :D\n\n5. There are often mistakes in writing \"Happy Birthday\" in Russian.

Grammatical genders are grammatical concept and are part of conjugations\n\n2. I don't mix genders from different languages\n\n3. I hardly associate grammatical gender to biological/social gender and building further associations there doesn't help me learn the language a whole lot.\n\nMixing grammatical languages from your language and your target language would take too much time, too. You need to learn 2000+ words for a great conversation, so you just don\u2019t have time to waste. \n\nAnd also I feel like my brain remembers genders of word as a grammar concept, very far from social genders(e.g. men and women).\n\nI learnt 1000+ Italian words and when learning genders I would only note the grammatical gender, and I would associate the word with its meaning and the situation you would use it in. That\u2019s the association that will help me to learn the language. \n\n3rd on my list bothers me a bit, but it is true: The words for \"horse\" in Italian and Russian: If cavallo is masculine and \u043b\u043e\u0448\u0430\u0434\u044c is feminine - that doesn't help me. And associating horses to their biological genders would feel weird. Like, now if I think about it, I could now imagine mnemonic like \"Italian horse and Russian horse are husband and wife\", but this association will take more time to generate, because grammatical masculine gender for horse in Italian doesn't connect to biological/social gender in real life and same goes for Russian. Both biologically feminine and masculine horses would be called \u043b\u043e\u0448\u0430\u0434\u044c.\nAlso, it hardly helps me that word for horse \"cavallo\" is masculine and word for horse \"\u043a\u043e\u043d\u044c\" in Russian is masculine. Somehow, I just can't connect that \"Oh, how easy, both of these words are masculine\". It is because I still have to learn entirely new conjugations for Italian masculine nouns and it doesn't resemble Russian ones that much. So having the same gender doesn't aid me much.\n\nAs for grammatical mishap again: In German. Both German and Russian have three genders, but they don\u2019t mix for me. Even if I notice it, my brain knows that whatever it is, the genders just needs to be learnt ASAP. \n\n\nGrammatical genders are the basic grammar thing and you use them all the time, because you need to use them to form any type of sentence.

Like, as if you were suddenly made to be a Nordic language tutor, while all you wanted is to go to Aldi for groceries, maybe.\n\nHowever, when you are studying a language it is agreed that in order to learn it is best to speak to natives. Like, I googled \"Best tips to learn a language\" and first point of the suggested article is \"Conversation x3\".\n\n*I am not commenting how other countries handle this situations!\n\nI could imagine: \"Well, go to the language courses rather than talk to me\", but if you just arrived, it can be hard to navigate them, the quality can be poor and in other case it costs a fortune. Plus, you might not have time/be too stressed. You are lonely searching for friends and try to speak to people around... And you end up improving your English, because you can't talk to Nordics and only talk to other lonely foreigners.\n\n\nMoreover the advice for acquiring the language was \"use it in your \u201dhverdag\u201d!\".

I guess it is assumed before you step to a Nordic country you are fluent English.\n\n\nTo add here, I have met some Danish people that would specifically talk to foreigners in Danish, however they would act is if they are on a chivalry mission allowing \u201dforeign people\u201d to communicate in Danish language. Since by a language learner it is assumed a native will appreciate use of their language, it is very strange, when natives present their language as a untouchable something. \n\n\nAnd to be fair, Moscoweets are weird handling foreigners, too, but, as what I have heard, it doesn't look as if Russian is untouchable.
