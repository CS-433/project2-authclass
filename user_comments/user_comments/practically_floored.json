She wasn't a commoner by any sense of the word, she grew up on the Sandringham Estate which her family leased from the Queen and was close to the royal family her whole life. \n\nHer father was [John Spencer, Viscount Althorpe](\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Spencer,_8th_Earl_Spencer), a member of the British nobility, while her grandmothers had been ladies in waiting to the previous queen. She was also named after an Aunt Diana who had been a potential match for a previous royal which, had the marriage gone through, would have made her Diana, Princess of Wales, so her parents seemed to have the idea of her marrying the Prince of Wales and becoming Princess of Wales right from her birth. \n\nCharles wanted to marry Camilla but Diana fit the royal image better.

The thing that annoys me about those people, like that bloke from Boyzone and George Michael, suddenly they're very proud to be gay; when they've been cured, they'll be on the telly: 'Thanks for all your support.' And I always think, 'I wonder what the gay community think of that? 'They must think, 'You fucking shit.'\nIt's like George Michael, for instance, from 1981 onwards, or from whenever he was making music, he could have made it a lot easier for gay people in England, because he was the biggest pop star there was for six or seven years. But he chose to put the shuttlecock down his trousers and play up to that and deny who he actually is. I've got a lot of friends who are gay and they just think he's a fucking disgrace. They're not proud of him, or the geezer from Boyzone, they just think they're pathetic because you should be proud of what you are.\n\n>I understand, right, that it must be difficult at first, but at the end of the day, it's fucking 1999, man, do you know what I mean?
