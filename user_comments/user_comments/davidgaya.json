Take it as what it is, just one story (same for Matt). You have to create your own way.\n\nI've been using Anki with SpoonFedChinese since January 2019, and using MorphMan since October 2019, and contributed to MorphMan code during last Christmas vacations. The SpoonFed Chinese I use is the one available in AnkiWeb, not the paid-version that one guy offers (he is clearly not the author).  \n\nAt first I used Spoonfed as it was in Ankiweb, but quickly modified the card layout to fit my preferences. I remember creating a reversed card (English -> Chinese) that was great at first but became very frustrating.\n\nI run my repetitions like that for nine months and I could clearly see my Chinese improved. Spoonfed sorting was not optimal but I could live with it (sometimes suspending extra difficult notes).\n\nThen, thanks to Antimoon, Ajatt,  Matt vs Japan (MIA) and my own frustration with the reversed cards, I realized I could made my life easier. It was October 2019 when I made my changes:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* I got rid of my reversed cards\n\n\\* Started a new Deck with clozed sentences I mined from my immersion\n\n\\* I adjusted Anki parameters to tolerate more errors (aiming 80% retention)\n\n\\* Split SpoonFed in two (duplicate/almost identical) decks, one for Reading and one for Listening. That way I could adjust the Interval Modifier (and other parameters) differently for each deck.\n\n\\* Use MorphMan to sort my Decks.\n\nAltogether it was a great revolution in my Chinese learning.\n\nMorphMan is part of this success, sentences/words became easier to remember, therefore I could put more time and more new cards per day. I'm definitely not going back.\n\nBut MorphMan is far from perfect:\n\n\\* After you sort your sentences there is no way back to the original order.\n\n\\* Is complex and has bugs\n\n\\* Lacks maintenance (that's party on me because I could volunteer)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLong story short, you have to learn your own lessons and find your own way. You are in a journey (learning a foreign language) that will take you several years, investing a few weeks  learning/trying a new tool is worth to see if it pays off. And SpoonFed is great but only part of the equation, most important is Immersion and sentence mining.\n\n\u52a0\u6cb9!", "created_utc": "1591536160.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ft9l4pt", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_gy18lh", "parent_id": "t3_gy18lh", "score": "2", "subreddit": "Anki", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s9lm"}]
