The hundreds of masculine words with a plural in -\u0430. The dozens of words with a plural in -\u044c\u044f. The dozens of words with a stress jump only for the genitive plural, like \u043a\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0446\u043e, \u043e\u0432\u0446\u0430, \u0441\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0430, \u0437\u0435\u0440\u043a\u0430\u043b\u043e, \u0433\u043e\u0441\u043f\u043e\u0436\u0430...

Some words changing stem in the plural like \u0443\u0445\u043e-\u0443\u0448\u0438. I can keep going...\n\nAnd the part that is regular is a fractal of complexity. There are 10 stress patterns, and while (up to dozens of exceptions) almost all words regularly fall into a pattern, it's very hard to figure out which pattern will apply, hundreds of them are the way they are without reason, you can't know by seeing \u0432\u043e\u043b\u043a that it's going to be in pattern \u0432\u043e\u043b\u043a-\u0432\u043e\u0301\u043b\u043a\u0430-\u0432\u043e\u0301\u043b\u043a\u0438-\u0432\u043e\u043b\u043a\u043e\u0301\u0432, that's something you have to learn. The same goes for the short form adjectives and the past tenses, where the stress regularly jumps to the ending, and again you have to learn it for every common adjective and every common verb.\n\nAnd for verbs the stress jumps back in the present tense as well, luckily there's only one unpredictable pattern here, the one where the stress jumps back for every form but the 1st person singular, but still, there are very few rules to know when that's going to happen.\n\nAnd talking about the present tense of the verb, although most verbs are regular, that regularity is caught in 16 whole verb classes. And even inside those verb classes irregularities remain, like \u0435\u0445\u0430\u0442\u044c getting a random -\u0434- in the present tense, -\u0448\u0438\u0431\u0438\u0442\u044c- verbs not undergoing palatalization like every other verb of that form and having an irregular past tense, prefixed forms of \u0441\u0442\u043b\u0430\u0442\u044c conjugating as if the infinitive were \u0441\u0442\u0435\u043b\u0435\u0442\u044c for no goddamn reason,.... The formation of perfectives by adding a prefix is basically random, and the formation of imperfectives by adding an infix is quite complex, and again there are irregularities, like \u043e\u0442\u0440\u0443\u0431\u0438\u0442\u044c not going to ~~\u043e\u0442\u0440\u0443\u0431\u043b\u044f\u0442\u044c~~ but \u043e\u0442\u0440\u0443\u0431\u0430\u0442\u044c instead. Or \u0443\u0432\u043e\u043b\u0438\u0442\u044c to \u0443\u0432\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044f\u0442\u044c instead of the regular ~~\u0443\u0432\u043e\u043b\u044f\u0442\u044c~~.\n\nI don't mean to be confrontational with this rant, I absolutely love the Russian language and if you got to B2 you must love it as well.

I have very low self-esteem, but it's more than just that, it also breaks the flow of the conversation, usually I just switch back to English or stop talking altogether.\n\nI'm at a good B1 level, which means I'm rarely getting corrected anymore on things like spelling or basic grammar (genders, cases, verb forms,...). Rather, my mistakes consist of things like using the wrong word, calquing an English (or Dutch) expression, using the wrong verbal aspect, using the wrong case in this context, using the right words but making a sentence out of them that makes no sense at all, etc... These are still significant mistakes that I definitely need to fix, but not the kind that you can solve by cramming grammar from a book, rather they're part of the final nitty-gritty grind of becoming B2-fluent through acquiring all kinds of nuances and idiomatic expressions.\n\nApart from that, a minority, but a significant one, of the corrections are nitpicking or just plain wrong. I'm not talking about the usual prescriptivism, I've already figured out what grammar nazis would not like me to say, no, I've actually even been corrected on sentences which were lifted from the writings of natives. Or they adapt a word slightly, for example, changing \"no inspiration\" to \"no imagination\".

Is it just a problem of self-esteem?\n\nI've been considering asking not to be corrected anymore, but then there's the anxiety that I'm missing out on something. Though I'm not convinced corrections are helpful, most people seem sure that it's obvious corrections are a vital part of learning a language, so what if I'm wrong, and what if not getting corrected means I'm missing out on something helpful?\n\nInterestingly, apart from those servers I also have a monolingual Russian-speaking friend, who never corrects me. If on a rare occasion she didn't understand me, she used to quote the message with a single \"?\" under it, and I knew I had to try again.

This is still the case in Finnish, where there's no future tense at all, and you have to use context or specific constructions to express future actions.\n\nThe Indo-European languages that have an explicit future tense nowadays had to invent one themselves, and both English and Russian went for the auxiliary verb approach, English uses \"will\", \"shall\", \"go\" etc..., Russian uses \u0431\u0443\u0434\u0443, \u0431\u0443\u0434\u0435\u0448\u044c,... from a stem related to \u0431\u044b\u0442\u044c.\n\nSo why was this new system only applied to imperfective verbs in Russian?

While I wouldn't deny that cases are a bit of a mindfuck if you've never seen them before, there are only 6 of them, with only three declensions which overlap almost entirely in the plural. You'd be hard-pressed to read 3 or 4 pages without seeing every form at least once. Similarly, although Russian is gendered, the gender is in 90% of the cases obvious from the ending of the word, so it's not *that* bad.\n\nWhat I find really hard about Russian is the stress and the verb.\n\n* Stress in Russian is unpredictable. That wouldn't be so bad in itself, after all in English you have to know that \"democrat\", \"democracy\" and \"democratic\" are all stressed on different syllables. But in Russian the stress can differ between forms of the same word. For nouns there are ten paradigms, and although there technically are rules, they're are obscure, very long and contain multitudes of exceptions. For example the word for leg, \u043d\u043e\u0433\u0430 (noga), is stressed on the ending for most forms, except for the accusative singular and nominative/accusative plural where it jumps back a syllable. But thunderstorm, \u0433\u0440\u043e\u0437\u0430 (groza), is stressed on the second syllable for all singular cases, and on the first for all plural cases. And it's not just nouns, for the past tense of verbs stress sometimes jumps forward for the female form, rarely also for the neuter form, and rarely jumps backwards for the male form. Something similar happens for adjectives as well, where for example the dictionary form of the word for cheap is \u0434\u0435\u0448\u0451\u0432\u044b\u0439 (desho\u0301viy), the male short form is \u0434\u0451\u0448\u0435\u0432 (dyo\u0301shev) and the female short form is \u0434\u0435\u0448\u0435\u0432\u0430\u0301 (dyesheva\u0301).\n\n* There are 16 verb classes. From knowing the infinitive, it's impossible to know how the verb will conjugate. I have already come into contact with a complex verb system from learning French, but it's nothing compared to the one in Russian.\n\nI could go on forever about this, Russian morphology really is a fractal of complexity.

They then reapply their newfangled formula on the subjects once they've lost a lot of weight. The difference between the measured RMR and the one their formula conjures up is what they call metabolic adaption.\n\nThis is nonsense. There is no reason a linear regression on an obese population would apply just as well on subjects of a healthy weight. Try it on yourself, the formula is 1001 + 21.2 * FFM + 1.4 * FM -7.1 * age in years + 276 (if male). If I plug in my values (assuming a 20% bodyfat percentage), I get 2376 kcal/day.

Yet when their total daily energy expenditure was measured, they all scored comfortable over 2000 kcal/day.\n\nI'm not dogmatic about this, I'm absolutely willing to revise my opinions, but if I'm not mistaken then such claims could be objectively proven, and I'll believe it when I see it.\n\nI won't pretend to be able to explain why these mice engineered to be leptin resistant seem to get fatter on what should be a caloric deficit, maybe they just have a wider range of available metabolic rates?

To make it imperfective, the suffix -\u0430 is added, which triggers palatalization for this class of verbs, turning \u0442 into \u0447 (or occasionally \u0449 if it's a loan from Church Slavonic).\n\nIn general, (almost?) all core unprefixed verbs are naturally imperfective. A prefix turns virtually all verbs perfective (with annoying exceptions like \u043f\u043e\u043a\u0443\u043f\u0430\u0442\u044c from \u043a\u0443\u043f\u0438\u0442\u044c).

Why \"up\", what does an upwards motion have to do with completion? And why doesn't \"read up\" mean \"to read something completely\"? Because that's how the language works.\n\nTo make them imperfective again, you have to add a suffix to the stem like -\u0430 -\u044f -\u0432\u0430 -\u0438\u0432\u0430 or -\u044b\u0432\u0430. Which suffix depends on the final consonant of the stem and the class of the verb. Yeah...\n\n> So for any higher levels here, how do you do it- keep it in mind?

This is then grammaticalized into having a more resultative meaning e.g. \"that you have your land planted\", where the verb still needs to be transitive, but the focus is more on how the object has been changed by the verb rather than the possession of the object itself. Afterwards, the verb can be intransitive, agreement is fading, and finally the verb can be used with inanimate subjects as well.\n\nKeep in mind that these are slow processes, where people, just like today in Modern English, had a wide variety of constructions to express their thoughts, and were constantly adding innovations to it.

If you burn radial instead, your velocity goes up by 0.5%, for a whopping 7 m/s of delta-v, and your kinetic energy by 1%.\n\nSo for orbital insertion you basically have to burn prograde almost all the time. As you're doing that, during your ascent, i.e. before you reach your apoapsis, gravity works in your favor, reducing your vertical velocity, which means more and more of the delta-v you invest will be put in horizontal velocity. By doing so, you also delay reaching the apoapsis as the ground curves away beneath you.\n\nBut if you're past your apoapsis, you're working together with gravity in increasing your vertical downwards velocity. The more you burn prograde, the faster you fall, which leads to you spacecraft pitching down, which leads to more downward velocity etc... You can counteract that by pitching up, but that's a waste of propellant. And if your spacecraft has a TWR smaller than 1, you cannot even stop yourself from falling down if you pitch all the way up, so you'd need to achieve orbital velocity before you hit the atmosphere, which can be an issue if you're quite low.\n\nOf course, if you have a really high TWR, or you're very high up, it doesn't really matter.", "created_utc": "1643730160.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hv57f1q", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_sh24i3", "parent_id": "t1_hv0jxw4", "score": "3", "subreddit": "KerbalAcademy", "subreddit_id": "t5_2wrxb"}, {"author": "kmmeerts", "body": "I found this instead: https://megogo.net/ru/view/948-mesto-vstrechi-izmenit-nelzya.html\n\nIf you hover over the cog icon in the lower right of the video player, you can turn on subtitles in English, Russian and a few other languages.\n\nI watched number three on there without issue, but as with all random sites, it's a good idea to use an adblocker or other precautions.", "created_utc": "1643715359.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hv4cyo0", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_sfjp00", "parent_id": "t1_hv4c5ck", "score": "3", "subreddit": "russian", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qlc6"}, {"author": "kmmeerts", "body": "It's more like its lingerie", "created_utc": "1643670056.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hv23zqs", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_sh74mm", "parent_id": "t1_hv1220n", "score": "1", "subreddit": "funny", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh33"}, {"author": "kmmeerts", "body": "I sloppily patched together some conics in Mathematica and found a trajectory with a Kerbin periapsis at 56 km with 838 m/s.

My point is that it's overly pedantic to generalize the definitions that are given to usually already existing words in certain very specialized contexts, because they are usually not relevant to anyone outside of the field, usually that distinction cannot even be understood, as in the case of pterodactyls it will have more to do with the shape of the ankles or the pelvis, than with what the animal generally looked like.\n\nIf you told a kid you were going to show them a dinosaur, a real-life one, not in a museum, and you plopped a chicken in front of them, they'd be disappointed, and they'd have the right to be so.

It's of course possible its irregularities got lost in the sands of time, but the point I'm trying to make is that the irregularities in the daughter languages only appeared at a later time. Sometimes the languages innovated new irregularities, like English replacing the infinitive with an unrelated verb *b\u02b0uH- meaning \"to become\", or Latin using that same root to make the perfect and future. Another common source of new irregularities came from resisting leveling, e.g. the past tense of \"to be\" used to be regular in Proto-Germanic, with the /r/ in \"were\" only appearing later as a consequence of a sound changing /z/ into /r/. This was a regular sound change, happening to all words, similarly the past participle of \"to lose\" used to be \"lorn\", but this was reverted back into the regular \"lost\" (except for the word \"forlorn\", where the connection with \"to lose\" is now unrecognizable).

Historically they come from a time when the hard and soft signs were still vowels instead of being silent, the sounds themselves sometimes disappeared, and sometimes turned into \u043e, \u0435 or \u0451.\n\nOf course, native Russians don't know this, they just learn the rules through exposure (and overgeneralize them). I think the main rule is that the vowel almost always disappears in the suffixes -\u043e\u043a, -\u0435\u043a, -\u0435\u0446, for example  the world \u0421\u0442\u0440\u0435\u043b\u043e\u043a (nominative), \u044f \u0432\u0438\u0436\u0443 \u0421\u0442\u0435\u0440\u043b\u043a\u0430 (accusative).

Paradoxically though, one of the spelling rules is that they can never be followed by \u044f and \u044e, they must be written \u0447\u0430-\u0449\u0430 and \u0447\u0443-\u0449\u0443. So although \u0434\u0430\u0447\u0430 has a soft stem, nevertheless one writes an \u0430 at the end. The softness does get reflected in the genitive \u0434\u0430\u0447\u0438, where you do not write \u044b.\n\nAnnoyingly, the same rules hold for \u0436 and \u0448, but this is wrong in exactly the opposite way, as they are phonetically hard, which means that it does make sense that things like \u0436\u044f are forbidden, and you have to write \u0436\u0430 instead, you also have to write \u0436\u0438-\u0448\u0438, never \u0436\u044b-\u0448\u044b.\n\nThe rule that \u043e needs to become its softening counterpart \u0435 only holds when it's unstressed, so the instrumental of \u0441\u0432\u0435\u0447\u0430\u0301 is \u0441\u0432\u0435\u0447\u043e\u0301\u0439, yet as you say \u0434\u0430\u0301\u0447\u0430 becomes \u0434\u0430\u0301\u0447\u0435\u0439.\n\nIt sounds complicated, but you get used to it, and as far as spelling goes, Russian remains quite regular.

So that the speed of light is constant for every observers is just equivalent to causality being similar to every observer?\n\nYes, sort of.

You could call this a dimension and glue it onto space to make spacetime, but that'd be very unaesthetic. Still, this universe was causal, because time only went in one direction and you had no control over its speed.\n\nHowever, even though it was causal, it lacked another property which physicists really like: locality. In Newton's universe, anything happening on the other side of the galaxy instantly influences what happens here. On the other hand, a universe with a maximum speed (which is the same for every observer) means events only influence things around them nearby in both space or time. Something happening on Sirius will only have an influence here after a decade.\n\nOf course, again physicists didn't make the universe, nor do we know for sure why things are the way they are, but locality is such a natural and nice property that I feel it gives context for why a Universe should have a maximum speed.\n\n> Btw if the time component is complex, it results with squaring in the -t2 component.

So a constant speed of light implies non-Euclidean spacetime, but usually we'd say that the specific type of spacetime we live in happens to be non-Euclidean, and also is of the type that happens to have a privileged constant speed.\n\n > Why is spacetime non-euclidean? Is it the only form it can be? Why does it cause such nonintuitive fact that speed of light is constant?\n\n\"Why\" questions are sometimes hard to answer in physics, especially when to refer to the most fundamental features of existence. You'd have to ask whatever Creator you believe in. If you'd ask me, I'd say it's because of causality. In our universe, cause always precedes effect, regardless of which observer you ask. This is incompatible with full rotational symmetry of spacetime, since if my spacetime-velocity vector is pointing forwards in time according to you, I can simply perform a 180\u00b0 rotation of that vector and now I'm going back in time. Timetravel would not just be possible, it'd be trivial, there'd be no notion of cause and effect. What is the future to me, might just be what is to the left of you.\n\nIn our universe however, you can't rotate your spacetime-velocity around. You can tilt it by boosting your velocity, and time will go slower or faster accordingly (this is called time dilation in special relativity), but you can never flip it around, it'll always point towards the future. Causality gives our universe order, makes it understandable. Enforcing that is to me the most important reason there's a non-Euclidean element to spacetime. But I didn't make the universe.\n\n> Why does flipping the sign of one coordinate (-) create an easy solution?\n\nPhysicists and mathematicians really like quadratic forms, i.e. roughly speaking sums of squares. They show up everywhere, in number theory, in differential geometry, in linear algebra, in Lie theory, in differential topology, ... So it'd be really nice if we could keep writing the square of the spacetime-distance as a sum of squares. It can't be a sum of just positive terms, because that's exactly what yields a Euclidean space. Hence instead of a sum of all positive squares, we add one negative square. Almost all of the math just keeps working, we just have to keep a few exceptions in mind, so this would make us really happy. Most importantly, it allows us to write the spacetime distance with a metric tensor, which is what put Einstein on the track towards General Relativity.\n\nPhysicists didn't make the universe of course, but lucky for us the universe seems to be understandable and describable by elegant math. It sometimes just takes us a while to figure out how to do so.", "created_utc": "1627215110.0", "edited": "False", "id": "h6gt5ca", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_oqxdqo", "parent_id": "t1_h6g5275", "score": "47", "subreddit": "askscience", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qm4e"}, {"author": "kmmeerts", "body": "Space being Euclidean implies it's symmetric under rotations (and translations, but we won't need that). So if you pick two points in space 1 meter apart, for example the ends of a rod, you will measure the same distance between these points now matter how you rotate this rod. In coordinates, this means that if we take a rod connecting (0, 0) and (3, 4), which by Pythagoras has length 5, and we rotate this rod around the point (0, 0) it'll always have the same length, the endpoint ending up at for example (5, 0) or (2, 4.58...) etc...\n\nNow, to go to spacetime we need to add a time dimension. Points in spacetime correspond to events happening at a specific place and a specific time. We can't really have physical rods anymore to connect a pair of events, but we can imagine a pulse of light between them, with one event being the pulse leaving a flashlight, and another event being the pulse of light hitting your eye.\n\nSo imagine a two-dimensional spacetime. We can still have coordinates, we just have to be a bit careful with the units, I'm going to assume seconds for the time dimension and lightseconds (299792458 meters) for the space dimension. Now imagine a pulse leaving at (0 seconds, 0 lightseconds) and arriving at (5 seconds, 5 lightseconds). Clearly this pulse travels at the speed of light, 5 lightseconds / 5 seconds = speed of light (by definition of the lightsecond). However, if spacetime is Euclidean, it is again symmetric under rotations, so we can rotate the end event of the pulse around the start event, to make it end up at for example (1 seconds, 7 lightseconds). The spacetime-distance remains the same, sqrt( 5^2 + 5^2 ) = sqrt( 1^2 + 7^2 ), but the speed we measure has changed dramatically, to 7 times the speed of light. By rotating by different angles, you can get any speed you want.\n\nSo a fully Euclidean spacetime is incompatible with a constant speed of light. But we do know the spatial part of spacetime appears Euclidean (at least, when there's no gravity!), so if we're going to unify space and time, we will still need to keep that symmetry. It turns out that a very natural way to do so is to keep measuring distances with a formula like that of Pythagoras, but flipping one of the signs. I.e., the distance between (0, 0, 0, 0) and (t, x, y, z) will be expressed as sqrt( -t^2 + x^2 + y^2 + z^2 ). Rotations involving just the x, y, z coordinates behave exactly as in Euclidean space, and \"rotations\" involving a time coordinate will be interpreted as boosts, changing the speed of your frame of reference.", "created_utc": "1627177691.0", "edited": "False", "id": "h6fgzja", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_oqxdqo", "parent_id": "t3_oqxdqo", "score": "223", "subreddit": "askscience", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qm4e"}, {"author": "kmmeerts", "body": "Palatalization is a core feature of the Russian sound system, and it's reliably and consistently reproduced by all natives, even illiterate ones who have no idea what a hard or soft sign is.\n\nBut to non-natives like me and maybe you, the difference can be incredibly subtle.

I'd interpret that sentence as saying that if 1000 cases with the delta variant test positive, 997 of those will be in unvaccinated people, and 3 in vaccinated people. As the vaccination rate in the US is about 55%, as a rough estimate we can assume the groups of vaccinated and unvaccinated people are of similar size. Hence 994 cases were prevented in the vaccinated group, leading to an estimated efficacy of 994/997 \u2248 99.7%. This is very rough, but no amount of fiddling with the numbers will lower it to below 90%, I'm already being generous here by considering the vaccination rate of the general population instead of just adults.\n\nWhilst it might seem that I confused the odds ratio of infections dependent on vaccination with the odds ratio of vaccination dependent on infection, these two are actually the same because about half of people are vaccinated. If the US had 30 times more unvaccinated people than vaccinated people, a number of 99.7% of new cases being unvaccinated would be believable.\n\nBut I can also prove it's bullshit with actual data. The UK provides [technical briefings](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/investigation-of-novel-sars-cov-2-variant-variant-of-concern-20201201) on the number of cases and vaccination status. From the last report, we find that 123,320 total delta cases, 71,932 were unvaccinated, or about 57%. Even if you only count people receiving two doses as vaccinated, the \"unvaccinated\" cases only count up to 112,786, or 91%. Whilst 91% may seem close to 99.7% it's a world of difference, a ratio of 30, it'd mean only about 400 vaccinated people would have gotten the delta variant, not 10k. An actually statistically decent analysis would shift these numbers of course, this is just a quick sketch in a reddit comment, but they wouldn't change them by a factor of 30.\n\n> Regarding demographics and behaviours there are indeed some (if not massive, significant) differences. While vaccinated people may, on average, be older and more at risk, they also by definition accept that Covid is a real risk, is not a conspiracy theory, likely wear a mask, practice social distancing, proactively self-isolate as a precaution, and generally don't gather in large closely-packed throngs shouting angry spittle-flecked protests about their freedom to do so. I realise not all unvaccinated people do that either, but the different behaviours along with the different group selection to that stated easily account for the different percentages between the vaccine's efficacy and the unvaccinated Covid cases.\n\nI find it difficult to believe these differences you perceive in the behavior would account for an order of magnitude. Yes, there's a larger proportion of reckless numbnuts among unvaccinated people, but even assuming their higher risk wouldn't have led to a significant fraction of them having gotten natural immunity, their behavior cannot possibly mean an at least 10x difference for the entire group of unvaccinated people. Furthermore, while I do believe the average vaccinated person will be more conscientious than someone who refuses to get vaccinated, anecdotally I've also found that a lot of vaccinated people will use their vaccinated status as a reason to be a lot less cautious.\n\nAnd again, it doesn't show up in the UK data.", "created_utc": "1626870837.0", "edited": "False", "id": "h5zv2tm", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_oo19tv", "parent_id": "t1_h5zpvf3", "score": "1", "subreddit": "LeopardsAteMyFace", "subreddit_id": "t5_3jp3p"}, {"author": "kmmeerts", "body": "If you have a Pre-Igniter you can charge more weapons than your weapons system supports.

For some reason, we teach children that Dutch has 6 \"tenses\", OTT, VTT, etc... because these are the six tense-aspect combinations Latin expressed purely synthetically, even though either language can express a wealth of tense-aspect-mood combinations, some synthetically, some with periphrastic constructions.\n\nBesides, even if Latin were useful for teaching linguistic concepts, and it's not, why not use one of the many living languages with a wealth of literature and poetry instead, like Russian or Japanese.
