The theoretical rationale was provided in the Output Hypothesis, formally introduced in Swain (1995) ([Summary](https://sites.google.com/site/mat44portfolio/index-of-readings/three-functions-of-output-in-second-language-learning)). There has also been ample empirical evidence, beginning in 1999 with Mackey's article on ESL question development ([pdf](https://eprints.lancs.ac.uk/id/eprint/59850/1/download5.pdf)) that interaction (combining input, correction, and output) leads to increased learning ( measured through higher accuracy on post-tests) when you compare input-only learners (people who watch a task but do not participate) to interaction learners (learners who receive both input and opportunities for output). That is, learners who interact learn more than input-only learners, and the only difference is the ability to produce output as well. This finding has been replicated consistently in the literature, and is the foundation of the interationist approach, a major framework used in second language acquisition ([overview](https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/edit/10.4324/9780203628942-15/input-interaction-output-second-language-acquisition-susan-gass-alison-mackey)).\n\nInput is important, and it drives most of language learning.

Okay. So, here\u2019s what I would recommend as someone who studied a Spanish major and also teaches Spanish now. \n\n1. Even if it\u2019s not a whole major, try to take a Spanish class in culture/literature for every semester. Those classes get a bad rap, but the input and language they expose you to is important for the advanced proficiency you\u2019re aiming for. C1/C2 is past conversational, it\u2019s academic. \n\n2. Start immersion. Refold has an okay guide, people also recommend Dreaming Spanish. whatever you like, but you need extensive exposure to the language outside of your classes. Your classes, especially language classes, are a guided tour of the language with an expert, but they can\u2019t teach you the whole language. \n\n3. Try to build social networks that include spanish speakers. I worked 45ish hours a week during college in a restaurant and spoke spanish on and off during every shift. Another friend of mine just made a ton of friends with Spanish speakers and learned that way. Regardless of what people say, producing the language is important for developing proficiency. \n\n4. Try to spend time abroad. I didn\u2019t, but i had plenty of exposure and practice. Studying abroad isn\u2019t a magical panacea, but it can help a lot if you do it right. Look for a program that places you with a host family. If you can swing a semester, go for a program that lets you take classes with native speakers.

There are a few different models, (one parent one language, language tied to certain activities, only polish at home) that you can research. Decide what works for your family and commit (we\u2019re talking years). When you use polish, make it fun, make it easy (lots of context cues), and don\u2019t put any pressure on her to speak it back (yet). Once she\u2019s understanding polish again, she\u2019ll start speaking on her own if she\u2019s interested.\n\nWhen she starts speaking, don\u2019t give grammar instruction or feedback.

Do those rules have to be prescriptive (this is how people should speak/the correct way) or can they be descriptive (this is how many/most people speak)? [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wn_eBrIDUuc&ab_channel=TED-Ed) does a great job of outlining a complementary approach to descriptive and prescriptive langauge. In most of language learning, despite what the research says, there is a worry about grammar, so it's here to stay. But we can teach grammar rules in a more neutral way (I call them tendencies a lot in my Spanish classes), while also acknowledging that other ways exist and those are also fine. So, in German classes you might teach Berliner German because it's widely understood by Germans, while also aknowledging that other dialects exist and are valid, but not our focus right now because we want to get a good grasp of Berliner German, or whatever.\n\nFor me, mistakes are not systematic. We all make mistakes, because we started something and lost our train of thought, or we misspoke, or we said the wrong word, etc. But they're isolated incidents. Once it becomes systematic--a community all uses a certain structure to express a certain meaning--its no longer a mistake. It's a community rule (this is how we say X).\n\nIf someone is studying English in your city, you should absolutely teach them the way that people there speak. What point is there in teaching rules they won't hear? There's also the question of what the goal is for regional variants--students should at least recognize them and understand them, but production will depend on circumstances. If the students are looking to stay in the area, in makes sense to practice those local forms, since that's what the'll hear. If the students are just there to learn the language (like study abroad or erasmus) and then return to their home countries, maybe acknowledge the local standard, but focus on the \"international\" standard.", "created_utc": "1663244804.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ioisyjy", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_xesf4l", "parent_id": "t1_ioiqkf0", "score": "1", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "dlt529", "body": "I look forward to getting downvoted for this, but videos like this just serve to advance elitism. \n\nGrammar rules are not pure abstractions of language. A common belief is that there is a \u201cpure\u201d variety of a language and regional dialects are corrupted versions of this \u201cpure\u201d standard. The truth is that grammar rules are usually codified rules of how a small, wealthy, educated group of native speakers use the language. Many people have access to this way of speaking only through education, and quality education may or may not be be readily available for all speakers. Language is an expression of identity, and insisting that one way is \u201cmore correct\u201d invalides other ways. \n\nGrammar rules have a place in language learning, sure, but talking about \u201cmistakes\u201d made by native speakers just serves to uphold systems that prioritize a small elite group versus the average speaker. There are multiple standards or sets of rules, and none are more correct than the other.

Unless you are getting a job that directly ties into IR (and in that case, you'd probably need a master's degree, very rarely are you being hired with a BA for the content), any college degree demonstrates critical thinking. Unless you're in one of the so-called professional schools (commonly engineering, nursing, business), your BA just means that you went to school. Also, there's some research that suggests that multilingual individuals have an edge in their professional careers ([source](https://www.amazon.com/Bilingual-Advantage-Language-Education-Bilingualism/dp/1783092424)).\n\nAdditionally, there's a [documented language skills gap](https://www.leadwithlanguages.org/wp-content/uploads/MakingLanguagesOurBusiness_FullReport.pdf) in the US work force. Chinese and French are both \"in demand\" languages. The reason that the skills gap exist is because fewer people are taking upper division courses in languages ([source](https://www.mla.org/Resources/Guidelines-and-Data/Reports-and-Professional-Guidelines/Teaching-Enrollments-and-Programs/Enrollments-in-Languages-Other-Than-English-in-United-States-Institutions-of-Higher-Education)) and fewer people have working proficiency. A language major in a good program is the best bet to develop that proficiency, especially if you grew up monolingual. If your ultimate goal is to interpret/translate, you'll need to complete rigorous courses of study in the language. Many people who self study (myself included) don't have the rigor to successfully translate/interpret, especially not in high-stakes situations. If you do a language major, take it seriously, see if you can take a class on second language acquisition in your first year, read about method, and make sure that you have a truly advanced level when you leave. \n\nFinally, I'd talk to your university advisor when you start. You should be assigned someone who will be able to help you figure this all out and plot out a trajectory. First thing I'd ask is if a triple major is possible--depending on where IR is housed at your university, it might be. Many times they're all housed in the College of Arts and Sciences, which makes a triple major ambitious but possible, because the general education requirements are the same. If a triple major isn't possible, I'd suggest looking into a major in IR and a major in one language, with maybe a minor in the second. Honestly, FSI estimates put working proficiency at 4-5 years if you consistently spend 10 hours a week on it (2200 hours to working proficiency, divided by (52 weeks times 10 hours a week), so it's doable but ambitious.

It trains the speaking skill (opening your mouth and producing the target language), but interpersonal communication is very different. It relies on on listening to and interacting with a real person, who may not follow the same script or say the things you're expecting.\n\nTo build interpersonal speaking, you might try text chatting and voice message chatting with exchange partners ([1](https://scholarspace.manoa.hawaii.edu/bitstream/10125/44031/1/09_03_payne.pdf), opens to PDF; [2](https://www.jstor.org/stable/24149607?casa_token=wk-0skLKubQAAAAA%3AlduZwl6GeyA4qd0I2uBUcF90x5rpJT6MvI2TjvvMdUE2QY2g0JnyO0vmiR92a_opZNh1_Bdw4zB4kM7gMM9hZ5a1dzkw9XCKn1lgKPOo43TfDXn64b7M#metadata_info_tab_contents)) There's evidence that text-based chat can build speaking proficiency in a similar way, because its training the interpersonal communication skills you need, even if its text-based. The next logical step is voice message chatting, where you send audios back and forth, which is the right skill (speaking), the right mode (interpersonal), just with less time pressure.\n\nAnd, I truly hate to say it, but one of Stephen Krashen's ideas, the affective filter, may also be worth considering. For Krashen, negative emotions like anxiety can have a negative impact on language performance (which is more or less supported by current research, I believe, but not as clear cut as he presented it). So, if you're approaching talking to another person with a lot of anxiety or with negative expectations, it's likely producing a negative impact on your skills.

The large majority of verbs in Spanish are regular (despite what it may seem), and follow the same pattern for those, so while brute-memorizing 1000s of verbal forms may give you a leg up, what you're really going for is the pattern that underlies the forms (like, past-tense -AR, \u00e9, aste, \u00f3, amos, asteis, aron) and the ability to generalize to new forms.", "created_utc": "1656511485.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ie6qi0c", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_vn9huk", "parent_id": "t3_vn9huk", "score": "1", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "dlt529", "body": "Personally, when I set out to learn a language, my long-term goal is near-native proficiency. My goal is to interact, easily and fluently, with speakers who don't speak English and don't interact a lot with nonnatives. I don't know how common this goal is, but it sounds like we're similar in our approaches and goals. I also agree with you--there's kind of a lack of discussion about really advanced levels of proficiency, which I define as the ability to confidently produce language across multiple situations and topics without either person needing to know my native language. Like I tell my upper division students, if you're claiming advanced proficiency, you should be ready to throw down any time, any place, anywhere and on any topic. It doesn't always have to be pretty (medical Spanish will always be my Achilles heel), but you have to be able to get through it without relying on the other person's ability to speak your native language. But how to develop that, besides \"practice a lot and watch TV\" is kind of missing from discussion online.\n\nIf it helps, there's also this same bias in the applied linguistics research. Beginning and Intermediate learners are plentiful, and we know SO MUCH about their development. There was recently a handbook of advanced proficiency, but from what a mentor told me, finding the relevant literature was really hard. We just don't know that much about it because its rare to find people at that level (and, in the US, even rarer to have that proficiency when you're an undergraduate student who can be easily recruited for research studies). \n\nI personally get frustrated with some of the advice given for reaching an advanced levels because it doesn't jive with my experience. I feel like I see a lot of people just insist that everyday content (TV, movies, news) will get them to an advanced level, and they actively discourage SRS/focused study. For me, the former gets you to a strong conversational level, but not enough for, say, professional proficiency (being able to work, comfortably, in the language across settings and contexts). I'm all for input, but to reach and maintain a high level, incidentally learning words (through content consumption) just wasn't enough, I had to add in an SRS and actively work to add domains of use. I think it might also be a side effect of the language learning community online. I think  lot of people online tend to go for a decent multiple languages, versus a very high level in a few, so as you get to that very high level you kind of have to muddle through on your own. Not saying that there aren't people who are looking to just get a high level in one on the sub (so please don't come for me), just that, proportionally, it seems like you get more of the former than the latter. I also know quite a few friends IRL that are super happy with a conversational level and whose definition of advanced is radically different than mine, so I think that sometimes, just what we mean by advanced isn't quite the same, so sometimes the advice doesn't quite hold up.\n\nI will also say, though, that I don't hold myself to a native speaker standard anymore. I used to, and I used to beat myself up constantly when I would make mistakes and would always feel bad about my skills. The thing is, most conceptualizations of a native speaker are a **monolingual** native speaker, and I'll never be a monolingual again. Reorienting to judging ability without the measurement of a native speaker helped my confidence and ability a lot, and it's fairer to my situation (we know that multiple languages influence each other in the mind). Anymore, if I'm looking to judge my proficiency or ability, it's a bilingual benchmark (so, a native Spanish speaker with a high proficiency in English). I also find that judgements of \"correct\" language, usually necessary when discussing native-like ability, are really hard to make and muddy the waters of proficiency--correct according to whom? I've had speakers from Mexico correct me on things my European friends approve of and my European friends insist that wide spread Latin American usage is incorrect. So, does it \"count\" against my proficiency if I'm mixing? Can I not be near-native in ability if I don't pick and practice exclusively in a single dialect?

Sometimes when I'm using Portuguese, I'll use a Spanish word and immediately know its not right, which I attribute to the color coding. You could try something similar when you use one pen color for one language and another for the other--its not immediate, but if you're systematic about it I'm convinced it helps. Some people advocate for keeping them separate (not mixing at all), but I also did Duolingo Spanish to Portuguese for a few months, and that helps with some of the basic structural differences.

If the class is conversation-based, or you're working on speaking, most teachers that I know (myself included) correct only mistakes that we think impede communication. So, when it comes to pronunciation, it has to be REALLY, REALLY bad for me to interrupt a student during speaking practice. We might rehearse something later, but I only intervene if they're struggling to get it out. most aspects of language will improve through use and a little self-awareness, including pronunciation. It can also be really demotivating to have a teacher constantly interrupting you to correct pronunciation, and it can be frustrating if you can't hear the difference.

However, there are some problems with the comparison, since the Duolingo learners are self-selected (they decided to study the language) vs university students who are generally completing their gen-ed requirement (and thus not interested in learning the language). There is also a [whitepaper](http://duolingo-papers.s3.amazonaws.com/reports/duolingo-speaking-whitepaper.pdf) (not peer reviewed, so generally less trustworthy as it was only reviewed by the authors, who mostly work at Duolingo) that showed that Spanish learners scored around the A2 level and French learners at the A1-A2 level after completing 5 units.

Grosjean (somewhere around 2010, I forget the exact year) argued that proficiency levels conflate native ability with educational level, just like what you\u2019re describing. When interpreting proficiency levels and terms like native like, it\u2019s often assumed (and never stated) that it refers to the language ability of a college educated native, monolingual speaker.

A proficiency level is a continuum and there aren\u2019t easy divisions between the levels. There is no magical moment when you evolve like a pok\u00e9mon into the next level and get a boost to all your skills.

The tests are to ensure a MINIMUM competency, not a maximum.

C2 is still meant to capture that continuum in theory, even if lay people misunderstand. \n\nAlso, just going to point out that proficiency levels like C2 describe *highly educated* native speakers. As early as the late 00s researchers were noticing that proficiency descriptors correlate to educated professional tasks (e.g give a professional talk), which some native speakers are not able to do well.

We\u2019ve recently introduced the idea of \u201cautomatized explicit knowledge\u201d, which is essentially facts that you apply so fast it LOOKS like intuition but somehow isnt. However, we know that people can use explicit knowledge (facts) about language during language use as well, as a lot of research design is about how to minimize the opportunities participants have to use explicit knowledge. We continue to say, however, that implicit knowledge (intuition) is the most important type of knowledge for language use.\n\nIMHO, facts about the language can help with more formal tasks. I draw on facts I\u2019ve learned about English during formal writing and use it to monitor my speaking in formal settings. Is it necessary to have facts to do this? Probably not. But it can probably help.

As you can probably tell, most studies with the input hypothesis are there to pit input-based learning against traditional methods (usually grammar-based).\n\nThis is kind of where I was going with my question. :) Both are technically stretches, but let's focus on the first one. This study is carried out within the framework or Processing Instruction, which is an input-based approach to instruction that makes use of what is sometimes called Structured Input. From the beginning, we are not testing the Input Hypothesis (Comprehensible Input \\[i+1\\] is necessary and sufficient for language development). Structure Input is input that has been manipulated to force learners into processing a specific grammatical structure that is known to be problematic for them. Students' attention is drawn to these structures and they are given feedback on whether they correctly interpret the structures. From there, your summary is pretty accurate. However, this isn't testing the Input Hypothesis, but rather the importance of Input.\n\nTwo major points here. Structured Input is different from Comprehensible Input because, although I don't think Comprehensible Input is defined as anything by Krashen but i+1, Comprehensible Input is globally comprehensible to the learner. Structured Input specifically highlights a single grammatical target. Second, no one besides a small group of researchers can ever get processing instruction right. A few attempts have been made to replicate studies, but the replications never find the same results and the original researchers always claim there are flaws in the replications, which is a huge red flag in science.\n\nI don't know of any studies that test input only vs input+output that aren't processing instruction, either, but if you come across any, I'd love to see them.

Most of Krashen\u2019s work is based on vibes only, and is actually phrased in such a way that it is untestable. The input hypothesis is a great example; intuitively, yeah input slightly above where you\u2019re at will help. However, comprehensible input is defined as i (current level) + 1. What does 1 refer to? How do we create a ranking system? How do we measure the current level? etc. It can\u2019t be operationalized in a robust enough way to study scientifically. Krashen\u2019s work is influential and hints at many ideas that are still researched in applied linguistics, but his work is not actively used to conduct empirical, data driven work, and many of his ideas were overstated and are not supported by research done in the \u2026 50 odd years? since he wrote them. \n\nCurrent research into\u2026 let\u2019s say more modern frameworks (the Output Hypothesis, the interactions hypothesis/approach) suggest that output is important for developing productive abilities. The general consensus is that output helps your language to develop by forcing you to focus on form\u2014we overestimate the role of grammar in understanding language. Many forms of input, unless designed specifically (see structured input and processing instruction), are comprehensible based on understanding lexical items (think nouns and verb roots) only. Output pushes you to also engage with grammatical form, and can be beneficial. \n\nAdditionally, research suggests that pre-simplified input (the kind found in dreaming spanish, for example) is less beneficial than interactionally modified input. That is, the best input for learning is negotiated with a native speaker during conversation, as compared to what someone thinks is comprehensible. This is because natural processes of interaction will render input comprehensible to your level, as opposed to guessing at what is and is not difficult for an abstract learner. Input can only be modified interactionally through engaging, in the target language, with the native speaker. \n\nInput ABSOLUTELY helps build language skills, but it is no longer seen as sufficient (the only thing you need) for the acquisition of communicative competence. I think people who are surprised that input helps so much are used to decontextualized grammar drills and production practice, which is also no longer widely used (or should not be widely used) in current approaches to language teaching. \n\nIf you want to communicate, most people will also need output practice. Some people maybe be able to produce without explicit output practice, but it\u2019s more likely to help than not.

If you\u2019re hoping to use a language professionally, it needs to be maintained regularly, otherwise it might not be there when you need it.

Like your examples, I don\u2019t think most Americans in typical situations can maintain 6+ languages. Trying to maintain one and learn a third is sometimes overwhelming, and I use Spanish regularly in my job. In that case, absolutely picking which ones are important to you and which ones you can pick up again can be a smart move.

The \u201cright\u201d answer is the one that you, personally, feel comfortable with and that meets your goals and needs. I personally learn a language because I want to interact with people who speak it and media in that language, so I plan on maintaining them. Right now, the goal is trilingual, so advanced levels of Spanish and Portuguese (C1 ish). Once I manage that, I\u2019ll decide how far to take german and if I like it enough to keep developing it. If i like it, it\u2019ll be permanently maintained, and if I don\u2019t, I\u2019ll let it go dormant to pick up another, but always maintaining Spanish and Portuguese.", "created_utc": "1645362081.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hxp61um", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_sx01h4", "parent_id": "t3_sx01h4", "score": "3", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "dlt529", "body": "The Fluent Forever Blog [link](https://blog.fluent-forever.com/gallery/) offers card templates that you can customize, including videos explaining the fields.

I\u2019ll explain why, but I\u2019m not gonna engage with comments on this post. \n\nLearning a minority language when the community *as a whole that speaks it* is explicitly against it is rooted in ideas of colonialism and imperialism. It is the thinking that cultures and languages, especially those in danger because of colonialism and imperialism, are commodities that majority groups have a *right* to. Taking indigenous American languages, they are endangered because of a long history of exploitation and violence perpetuated by majority groups. If they do not want to share their language and culture, that\u2019s their right, and ignoring that wish perpetuates the violence of colonialism and imperialism. This is especially the case when there are either a singular community that speaks the language or a small group with a governing structure that is against it. \n\nThis is different when languages are not spoken by a singular group and/or minority group, IMHO. Many of the \u201cbig\u201d languages that are commonly taught and learned are former languages of conquest, and they do not belong to a singular group of speakers, but are shared by various cultures and communities. This dynamic is different\u2014while some individuals might be against foreigners learning their language, other will not be. No one singular community can make the decision because it is shared across communities. Honoring those wishes and checking privilege means not engaging with those individuals in those languages. If someone is against speaking to me in Spanish because I am white, I\u2019m happy to speak English with them and engage in Spanish in other spaces that do not mind my presence. \n\nIf you are trying to support the community of a minority language, find other ways to do that they recognize and want. Foreigners speaking their language is going to do less to preserve it than donations or volunteering time for documentation and teaching initiatives. Ask what the community needs, and do that. Raise awareness, write to politicians to express support, rally, volunteer, whatever they have identified as initiatives and priorities. \n\nIf you are learning the minority language because of aesthetics or the challenge or whatever, pick a different language to explore. There\u2019s no shortage of interesting or challenging languages. \n\nIt is unfortunate that languages die, especially as a result of imperialism and the growing globalization of the world.

This is going to be a long one.\n\nThis is covered under the Output Hypothesis (usually cited as Swain, 1985). It grew out of observations of French immersion programs that were mostly providing comprehensible input to students. Their comprehension was phenomenal, but their speaking wasn\u2019t. \n\nOutput has 3 major roles: noticing, hypothesis testing, and metalinguistic reflection. Through output, learners are more likely to notice gaps where their language is not sufficient. This is especially true for grammatical morphemes, which might be missed in comprehension because they are not important to the message (most things can be understood  by understanding lexical words paired with context). Output, however, gives us a chance to notice gaps between what we want to say and what we can say (and primes us to look for what were missing later). Hypothesis testing let\u2019s us try out current representations (our current ideas about grammar), and then see if it\u2019s successful. If others are confused, we didn\u2019t get it right, and our rules need to be refined. Metalinguistic reflection is harder to summarize, but the general idea is that, in interacting with others, we are likely to engage in reflection about forms with them when needed, which leads to better learner.\n\nThe output hypothesis was one of three hypotheses (the others were the noticing hypothesis and the input hypothesis) that were used to formulate the interaction hypothesis (now one of the largest approaches to understanding language learning and teaching). In this approach, interaction with others facilitates acquisition through making conversation comprehensible through simplification until Input is comprehensible. In the mid-90s, studies on input showed that more learning occurred with conversationally modified input (someone you talk to reformulates to account for your language level) versus ore-modified input (someone makes input \u201csimplified\u201d without knowing you, like a video on YouTube). It\u2019s normally claimed this is because conversationally modified input is tailored for your level, which means it contains a bunch of d to stuff you\u2019re ready to notice. However, this research is more technical and not as widely available to non-specialists outside of the academy, so Krashen continues to be dominant in popular spaces, even though as a field, Applied Linguistics has moved past many of his ideas to a more nuanced view of the mechanisms he describes. \n\ntldr; Output is crucial because it helps you notice places where your language isn\u2019t up to snuff, try out what you think you\u2019ve heard, and negotiate with others to get it right. It\u2019s one of three points of the interactionist approach, a major framework for understanding language learning and teaching, but isn\u2019t as widely known because it is not as accessible as Krashen\u2019s work from the 1970s, which is why so many people will insist input only is sufficient, even when we\u2019ve known since the 80s it isn\u2019t.", "created_utc": "1644323632.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hw2ot48", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_sng2dr", "parent_id": "t3_sng2dr", "score": "24", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "dlt529", "body": "A problem with language exams like the DELE is that they are as much about strategy as they are about language.

There's no consensus on a certain % because of the number of factors that influence it (age of onset, typologocial similarity between language, duration of stay), but trying to find \"native passing\" learners is incredibly difficult for applied linguists. I will also say that accent by itself isn't enough--word choice, grammar, or pragmatics can also give you away as a nonnative speaker, and you're constantly being evaluated on the combination, not one discrete part.\n\nOn top of that, add in sociolinguistic considerations like different dialects and register. Many languages are [pluricentric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pluricentric_language), so every country has their own standard, and many times language learning either mix standards or are not clear on what standard they are teaching. For example, many courses teach \"Latin American\" Spanish, but this doesn't correspond neatly to one particular standard, so even if you speak \"perfect\" Latin American Spanish, you don't actually speak like anyone from Latin America. So, you can have a very clear accent that is target-like (faithfully represents a language standard) and still not sound native because it is, ironically, \"too standard\".\n\nI think that a comprehensible accent, especially to native speakers not used to dealing with learners, is important.

I was ASTOUNDED by the number of people who adhere to his methods and the number of youtubers who continually stick to it and swear off output, mostly because in Applied Linguistics no one is currently using Krashen to frame research. \n\nHis ideas are\u2026 fine. A lot of them still exist in some form today in the literature. But many of these ideas have been further developed and these developments are largely ignored. For example, his distinction between learning and acquisition still exists, but as implicit and explicit knowledge. And rather than the clear cut \u201clearning/explicit is bad, acquisition/implicit is good\u201d, applied linguists accept that it\u2019s a complicated picture and we aren\u2019t entirely sure what the roles are. The thing is, there probably is a role for explicit knowledge (grammar rules). Whether they become automatized to implicit knowledge, become something else that\u2019s really similar, or help us to notice grammar features in the input to make them easier to acquire no one really knows, but we accept they\u2019re a part of language use. A large part of our methods training is learning how to tap into implicitly WITHOUT explicit, which to me has always suggested a larger role than we normally acknowledge. \n\nEveryone agrees that input is important, so the Input Hypothesis is on the right track, but difficult to operationalize. How do you determine your current level and what is \u201c+1\u201d? Additionally, comprehensible input is often simplified, and simplified input does not necessary present an accurate picture of the target language, depending on whose doing the simplifying. \n\nI wish more people knew that applied linguistics continued after krashen. The Interaction Hypothesis (Long, 1996) is more widespread and empirically supported. It demonstrates that conversation can help support acquisition in ways that input only does not. Input is important, and by interactions with expert speakers input is rendered comprehensible to the level that you need it, in a way that still represents the target language. Interaction triggers corrective feedback, which is helpful for learning because it can juxtapose an incorrect learner structure with a correct native/expert one when the learner is focused on meaning, and also provides for output, which has been shown to support language development through hypothesis testing about the language and helping learners to notice what\u2019s missing in their language. \n\nSo basically, speaking with someone causes them to 1. naturally simplify the language for you in a way that you can understand while still following norms of the target language, 2. provides you with feedback while speaking when it is more likely to be effective, and 3. allows you to test hypotheses about what is and isn\u2019t allowed and what you can\u2019t say. \n\nThis hypothesis (or approach) forms the basis of Task-Based Language Teaching, which is becoming the preferred method for language teaching in post-secondary education, especially in the US. It\u2019s a great way to frame learning, and I personally find that it makes learning more enjoyable. Maybe not as the ONLY part of learning, but definitely one of the central components of my method. \n\nKrashen had some good ideas and made them very accessible.

It happens a lot when the languages are similar (I can\u2019t imagine trying to learn Portuguese and Spanish from zero at the same time), but may still happen when they aren\u2019t because your brain knows it needs a non-English word for something and if it doesn\u2019t have it in one language it will go to another. This will fix itself with proficiency, but it can still be annoying. \n\nHow fast you learn is also impacted because you are splitting your available time between two languages. Language learning is directly related \nto how much time you spend with the languages; learning two at once cuts thats time in half. Also, some beginning level tasks are really repetitive (e.g., Duolingo and Anki everyday), and doing it in two languages may make it really boring and cause you to give up. \n\nPersonally, I like to have languages at different levels when working on two. So, something in the beginner range that is a lot of memorizing and grammar reading and something in the middle range that is more conversation and starting to consume media. This keeps the studying from feeling too repetitive (so I\u2019m not learning basic family terms at the same time or reading about grammar all the time, etc). I think one of the major demotivators for learners, especially if it\u2019s your first language, is not seeing progress. \n\nSo I would recommend picking the one you are most passionate about it and working on it this year, and then setting a date for working on your next one as well.

I\u2019d suggest sticking with it through (most of the tree), especially if you\u2019re a casual student (enjoying it, not necessarily ready to spend 2-3 hours a day on it. \n\n2. As you near the end of the tree, start looking for vocabulary alternatives. I prefer Anki, but its a big investment. Memrise also works well. Find a frequency deck (top 5000 words) and/or a shared deck with sentences on Anki. If you\u2019re feeling more ambitious, Fluent Forever has a, if not unique, structured approach to using Anki. \n\n3. Keep working with native materials. As your vocab increases, switch subtitles to Spanish as soon as you can keep up. Don\u2019t forget about other sources (twitter, instagram, tik tok all have great, bite-sizes language content). \n\n4. Start producing! r/ESWriteStreak is a sub for practicing writing everyday, and HelloTalk and Tandem are good apps for finding language exchange partners. There are also a lot of discord servers for it. \n\n5. At some point, maybe formalize your goals. Having a clear idea of where you\u2019re going lets you break down more concrete steps, and these become goals to work towards and things to practice. (If you want to read the news in Spanish, start reading articles, maybe once a week and then increasing; if you want to watch Spanish TV shows without subtitles, start with watching one episode a week without and rewatching until you get it, etc).

So, take 3-6 months and only consume media in your target dialect, and listen for what you would have said differently (what do they say instead of vale or mola?), and make an effort to use those forms.

If native passing is what you\u2019re after, you\u2019ll need to select a country and input flood-only media, songs, and reading from that country. \n\n2. [The Interactive Atlas of Spanish Intonation](http://prosodia.upf.edu/atlasentonacion/metodologia/index-english.html) has up to datw information about almost every dialect.

You say imitate, do you also record and listen?  Also, I always tell my students to exaggerate. Go over the top. Ridiculous. Day time soap opera. That way, something still sticks. We avoid it in modern language teaching, but listen and repeat helps. You could set up an Anki deck with recordings, and record yourself repeating it back to compare. Once you\u2019re honing in on it, pick a celebrity from that region (preferably matched for gender/age/general pitch) find interviews and do the same thing\u2014listen, repeat and record, compare, and try again. \n\n4. I\u2019d also articulate your motivation\u2014why is this important to you? When you get discouraged, imagine situations when you DO pass for a native.

So here are some thoughts (SO SORRY THIS GOT SO LONG)\n\n1. Advanced fluency takes a long time to develop. :) Most BA holders in Spanish without a semester/year abroad tend to end up at Advanced Low, and I'm betting you're Advanced Low who is a little too hard on themselves. So you're right where you should be, which as you say is not a bad place to be, and there's no way to rush it, unfortunately. It will take time and patience. The good news is that Advanced Low tends to be the cut off for teaching (when there is a cut off), and I would say roughly 60-70% of language teaching has NOTHING to do with proficiency and everything to do with technical knowledge of language teaching and connecting with students to motivate them. Prior to spending time abroad, I was always self conscious and embarrassed about my Spanish. Years later, multiple friends admitted to being intimidated by my Spanish when we started the Master's program.\n2. Study/sojourns abroad are often touted as the golden bullet for advanced proficiency, but stories abound of people who spent months or years abroad and didn't see huge gains to their proficiency. This is because what drives language development is language use, which makes it tricky to know before going if it will be worth it. We assume being abroad will help with language use, but it isn't guaranteed, as some people have mentioned. I'd need more info on how you consume media/practice, but what I often see with my university students is they're doing passive reception and not studying or production. There is something to be said for watching and learning to follow a TV show or a movie to enjoy it, but the other side is paying attention and writing down new/surprising ways of saying things to study late (in Anki, por ejemplo). Reading is what boosted me to the C1/C2 (Advanced mid/high) level, and it took probably 2-3 years of reading regularly and studying new words/structures I found to feel comfortable with it. Same thing with conversation--small talk only gets you so far. HelloTalk/Tandem/iTalki could be useful for more speaking practice as well. Most of this work didn't take place abroad, but after I returned. \n3. I'd also think carefully about region before going and plan the experience you want to ensure it's worth it. What I always ask my students is: Does it have to be Spain? Programs in Spain tend to be more expensive because its Europe, and ultimately harder to achieve immersion in. In Latin America, in my experience and the experience of friends/students, it's harder to find people who have high levels of English proficiency, so its easier to immerse yourself (and Latin America is AMAZING). If it does need to be Spain, research a little the areas if you have any options. I spent a year teaching English in Sevilla (Andaluc\u00eda) and, while some people would insist in English, most people spoke Spanish to me when I insisted and I had a similar level. Big cities (Madrid and Barcelona are ones I've heard stories about) are really hard to find immersion in. Make sure the program allows homestays or be dedicated to finding either Spanish roommates OR other international students who either don't have a high level of English or who love Spanish. I've done both and was ultimately happier sharing with two girls, one from Britain and one from France, and our de facto language of communication was Spanish. \n4. For your living situation, does it have to be a year, or could it be a series of smaller stays? That would lessen the impact on your relationship and household finances, and if planned out well could be just as beneficial. \n\n**tldr;** be kind to yourself and know it takes time, consider your approach to language practice to make sure you're working the right skills and domains, carefully plan the study abroad and it will be worth it.

The pret/imp can be incredibly frustrating. I\u2019ve been teaching since 2013 and am completing a phd in hispanic linguistics (so I\u2019ve studied both the learning stages AND the linguistics behind the target). Unfortunately, there aren\u2019t any hard and fast rules. :( A few things:\n\n1. The preterit and imperfect invite speakers to project a meaning onto a verb (completed vs on going, in the simplest form). Because this is so bound to speaker intention, it becomes difficult to come up with \u201ccorrect\u201d rules\u2014two people viewing the same action may choose to encode it differently, based on what you ask them to do and how they approach it. So the previous comment was very good advice\u2014just keep paying attention to how meaning is made, and it\u2019ll get better. Standardized grammar tests, like the DELE, will pretend there\u2019s a right answer, but the only correct answer is the answer that successfully communicates your intention. Sometimes speakers will correct you because they realize that the meaning you\u2019re trying to make based on context doesn\u2019t fit with the tense choice, but thats the best we can do. \n\n2. Confidence with pret/imp comes VERY late. Even at the advanced level (C1/C2), I felt unsure of my choices in certain places. There are multiple factors we juggle when selecting which tense, including properties of the verb, discourse motivations, and adjectives. Sometimes these come into conflict, and we\u2019ll never be sure if we got it \u201cright\u201d, but see above. The article by Liskin-Gasparro (2000) (Hispania, available via Jstor, which i believe is free) is a very accesible illustration of this. \n\n3. Finally, extended narration in the past tense belongs to the advanced levels of development. :) speakers at the ACTFL advanced level (roughly C1, I believe?) show extended, accurate (contextually appropriate) use of past tense marking. If your level is B1, being able to confidently select and use them in sentence levels is exactly where you should be. Development on this front will be slow, so direct your attention elsewhere for now and keep using Spanish (prose is EXCELLENT for this), pay attention to stuff that looks new and it will get better. I know its frustrating, but tenses develop slowly, we just have to keep pushing on. \n\nSome stuff on proficiency\n\nhttps://www.laits.utexas.edu/spt/intro\n\nhttps://oralproficiency.coerll.utexas.edu/", "created_utc": "1582293409.0", "edited": "False", "id": "fia5dm9", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_f76hg9", "parent_id": "t1_fi9mt9y", "score": "5", "subreddit": "Spanish", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qtt1"}, {"author": "dlt529", "body": "To add to this: In Spain cuidarle is acceptable, due to their tendency to use \u201cle\u201d for \u201clo\u201d for animate masculine things (le\u00edsmo).\n\nIn \u201cGeneral\u201d Latin American, acceptance of \u201cle\u201d for a direct object varies.

So don't let that discourage you!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGrammar learning takes a different type of skill as opposed to vocabulary learning. Vocabulary is mostly explicit or declarative, similar to other types of knowledge. Grammar relies on implicit or procedural knowledge, especially in spoken language. Feeding those types of knowledge are very different--vocabulary can be effectively studied through normal memorization techniques, but implicit knowledge needs to be built through meaningful communication. The best way to learn a language is to expose yourself to it and try to extract as much meaning as you can. Not everything! Just the gist. Little by little it gets easier and you can learn more and more. You also won't be perfect as you start off--language learning is all about the failure! By not getting it right, you get better.  I've been recommending the fluent forever website ([https://fluent-forever.com/](https://fluent-forever.com/)) because it offers a great, applicable framework for learning which is well rounded in current linguistic research. The idea, though, is start with a minimum of vocab (he has a list of the top 600ish words that are a great start, that's how I'm learning French), and then you dive in with something you enjoy and learn as you go!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFinally, the language you'll learn most effectively is the language you're motivated to learn. :) Motivation is one of the most investigated individual differences, and the correlations it shows with overall achievement (usually course grades but oh well) are far greater than any other variable considered. The easiest model for most people is the integrative/instrumental model--instrumental motivation has to do with our desire to achieve external goals (motives relating to utility, promotion, etc.) and integrative motivation has to do with out desire to form a part of the target language community. Generally speaking, integrative motivation results in stronger effort, although both are necessary. Instead of studying a language that makes sense, find a language you like! You said you studied Spanish over French because it seemed like a smarter choice, but French is also spoken around the world (Canada, Europe, Africa...). I always tell my students that learning a language is like adopting a puppy--it takes daily practice, time, and effort, so they should make sure they get a puppy they'll really want!", "created_utc": "1545001677.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ebxwx3w", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_a6o28g", "parent_id": "t1_ebxk8m1", "score": "2", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "dlt529", "body": "Isso \u00e9 exatamente o que diz tudo mundo!

Languages are packed goods\u2014unless you have a very specific goal (e.g. ONLY speaking/listening, only reading knowledge), the differences will wash out.

Any time you \u201csave\u201d from the pronunciation will have to be invested in the grammar. French seems to be the opposite-Spoken French lacks a lot of the inflectional morphology found in Spanish, but the pronunciation is more difficult (lots of new vowel sounds that are hard to perceive for the English ear), so you\u2019ll spend more time practicing pronunciation. This is complicated further by the intersection of various individual differences, ranging from affective (motivation) to cognitive (working memory).

Attrition is modulated by varying factors, and will not always look the same for all learners.  Languages are dynamic processing systems-- not a set of rules or an internal grammar, but rather various systems working together to produce the language.  First language attrition has to do with influence from the Second Language system, according to the article.  Essentially, what happens is the Second Language of the bilingual introduces variability into the system that isn't normally there, meaning that certain rules that are always applied in a native speaker may only be applied some of the time for the bilingual in question.  Some language systems are also more prone to attrition: generally we see a loss of complicated syntactic structures (subordinate clauses, etc) before we see a loss of pronunciation.

I have a friend that learned Spanish to an advanced (near native speaker) level this way, and I boosted my basic portuguese to conversational in a few weeks with this same method.  :3\n", "created_utc": "1358232421.0", "edited": "False", "id": "c7x6sbp", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_16kn5i", "parent_id": "t3_16kn5i", "score": "2", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "dlt529", "body": "Well I think it would depend a lot by what you mean on \"learn\" a language.  Do you mean be able to hold your end of a conversation with your friends? Watch a movie/tv show and understand?  Read a novel?  Your end definition of what \"speaking a language\" will effect how much time it takes.  Loftier goals take more time. ;) \n\nI think that 3-4 months of super intensive study would be plenty.  I learned conversational portuguese in a semester, and I definitely didn't spend that much time on learning it (granted I already speak Spanish, and the class was designed for Spanish speakers...).  The important thing is to stick with it! And vary what you're doing.  Duolingo and Memrise are great tools, but definitely won't teach you to speak a language.

Adjectives aren't definitions, although they kind of seem that way... The best way of looking at it is if you use ser+adj, you're saying it's an inherent trait of that person, while estar describes them (but doesn't define them).  Ella es callada- She is always quiet.  Ella est\u00e1 callada: she is quiet (today/right now).  Sometimes it takes a second for me to decide as well, but as already mentioned, just pick one.  Very rarely will it create a breakdown in communication, and most likely, they'll understand you.  And keep your ears open, and listen to which native speakers use.  Usually they won't be able to explain why, but they'll always use them 'correctly'. :3", "created_utc": "1358126842.0", "edited": "False", "id": "c7wfp3g", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_16ir4h", "parent_id": "t3_16ir4h", "score": "1", "subreddit": "Spanish", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qtt1"}, {"author": "dlt529", "body": "I just finished watching Avatar: The Legend of Korra in Spanish.

You have to be dedicated and work on it everyday, though.  When talking to him about it, that was the biggest point he made- you have to make the effort to engage and use (whether it's speaking, reading, writing, or listening) every day for it to be successful.
