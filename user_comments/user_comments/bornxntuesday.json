I don't know where you found this term, but \"vacilando\" in Spanish doesn't mean that. It's the gerund of the verb \"vacilar\", which can mean a few things. Most people use it as \"joking around\", or \"teasing\", even \"fooling someone\" (but with comedy purposes, I guess). I can't find the perfect word for it in English, but it's a type of joke. It can also mean \"to hesitate\", or that something/someone is moving unstably (\"to stagger\"?). That is in Spain's Spanish. In some Latin American countries, it can mean \"to have fun\".\n\nI'm trying to say this in the nicest way possible, really. I just had never heard of that definition of \"vacilando\".\n\nI have a few more Spanish words without a direct English translation like:\n\n* Friolero/a (adj.): someone who is prone to feel physically cold. They're more sensitive to the cold. The opposite would be \"caluroso/a\".\n* Estrenar (vb.): wearing a piece of clothes you recently bought (or got gifted) for the first time. You can also say it about other objects, like \"estrenar\" a car because you're the first to drive it.\n* Merendar (vb.) / merienda (noun): it's a meal and the act of eating that meal.

You would also be able to change the decor or the placement of the apartment if you get further in your career, unlocking them. But we could unlock other stuff, like clothes or emotes. \n\nInstead of using 10-20 ranks like other roles, this one would have at least a hundred, since finishing it soon wouldn't make it fun. Maybe you could level up infinitely, but prizes and unlockables stop at some point. After that, it would be just a number you can flex about.\n\nThere would be different modes.\n\n- Tournament style. Eight fighters. You against another player. The winner will fight against the winner of the other pair and so on until there's only you. Being first would grant you more role XP, money and a bit of gold. \n\n- Informal combat. Just you against other person. No big prizes, because it would be too quick. But I would be a fun alternative for those who are in a hurry, instead of leaving the lobby without finishing the contest.\n\n- Last man standing. All against each other. A bunch of players released into the fighting pit at the same time. The winner would get greater prizes the bigger the lobby is.\n\n- Teammates. A team against another team.\n\n- Pairs. A pair of fighters against a another pair. If one dies, the other can keep fight and they both would win. It would work like tournament style.\n\nBut... what would be an underground fight without bets?  You could bet in some of the modes and win some extra dollars.\n\nI'm thinking that there should be missions to fight NPCs around the world. Maybe as \"training\". Just like bounties work, but using your fists. \n\nI'm basing this on that mission from story mode (no spoilers, if you know you know) and Arena War from GTAO. But since the latter one is too grindy, cutting the amount of ranks in half and avoiding random prizes (meaning, all the players unlock the same item at the same level), it would help make the role more fun and less like a chore.", "created_utc": "1641817140.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hs1ydob", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_s022xj", "parent_id": "t3_s022xj", "score": "13", "subreddit": "reddeadfashion", "subreddit_id": "t5_phg5t"}, {"author": "bornxntuesday", "body": "You don't.

I know fans enjoy it way too much, I used to have a friend who loved it.\n* Assassins Creed Odyssey. Very entertaining and with many secondary quests. There is a good amount of romanceable characters and some of them have really interesting stories. Also, it's Ancient Greece, it gets extra points for that. I guess you could play Valhalla too, but I haven't played it myself (yet). \n* Fallout 4. I enjoy the game itself way too much, but also you can have companions and win their hearts. You can have several boyfriends/girlfriends, and even a one night stand.\n* Life is Strange series and Tell Me Why. They're story-driven, but you can make the main character have a romance or not, or even choose between two options. You can get the last instalment (True Colors) on Switch and the LiS1 remaster and its prequel will come out in 2022.\n* The Witcher 3. There are a couple of romance options and I really enjoyed making Geralt date my favourite option. I think it's available on Switch.\n* Skyrim. Yes, you can marry people and adopt children, but... that's it. You don't really see the relationship progress. Maybe there are mods for that, but not if you play it on Switch. It's a good game, nonetheless.\n* Games similar to Stardew Valley where you can date but I haven't played (not at least their newer games for Switch): Rune Factory 4 & 5, Harvest Moon...

But I want to list the smaller things I want.\n\nFixes/animations:\n- A fix for the advanced camera. You can focus lock with the cheap one, but not with the advanced? Wtf? Also, more zoom.\n- More poses for the self-portrait mode. I'm not asking for anything complex, I just want to hold my gun or rifle, emote like you do in the photography studio...\n\nAesthetics and fashion:\n- Open vests without the jacket on top. Seriously, I just want to wear a shirt with an open vest.\n- Beige and light brown colours for pants, more Earthy tones. The ones we have are too yellow or too dark, but it's such a common colour.\n- Dark blue/navy vests. We don't have any. And if we do, they must be limited because I don't own them.\n- Wearing masks with hats.\n- Tattoos and face paint. \n- Belts.\n- Other types of clothing. I have so many ideas and NPCs wear very similar stuff. For example, bigger scarves that fit almost like ponchos. Or scarves you can use as a bandana/mask. Also, scarves over the head. There's one I really like, there's an NPC in Armadillo that wears it, it's like a cape over his shoulders, but it has a hood! Imagine being able to put on and down the hood, like we can in GTA. I have many ideas and how they'd work to avoid clipping and still fit in this era, but this paragraph is getting too long lmao.\n\nActivities:\n- Blackjack!\n- High stakes poker. I mean, losing a few dollars is nothing to me, a rank 295.\n- Domino. Most people hate it but I'd love the option. The three modes, playera would vote which.\n- The knife game, I don't remember the name. Place a bet against a friend and start stabbing your hand to see who wins!\n\nOther features:\n- Sending letters. I know people in this sub don't want a chat like in gta, but at least on console they can send sms if they don't have a mic. Private messages in Social Club are a bit of a pain in the ass. And letters wouldn't be instant, you'd have to pick them up and read them. Maybe you could save your favourites in your satchel. I'd love to send silly letters to my friend so she can read them when I log off.\n- Fight club! It could be for a new business. The wrestling in this game is too much fun.\n- The casino boat. It exists, we could just get a ticket in the port and it would teleport us there with a cutscene of our character going on a boat. I don't know. The point would be having a place with all the games to bet and have fun. With places to sit and pose and take pics, please.\n\nI can't think of more right now, but there's probably more in my head.", "created_utc": "1638021622.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hm9vw3h", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_r331t4", "parent_id": "t3_r331t4", "score": "9", "subreddit": "RedDeadOnline", "subreddit_id": "t5_3ewph"}, {"author": "bornxntuesday", "body": "Yes, 5 a year or so, I'm level 53.

Four years forward, I was able to watch live tv and youtube videos in English, understanding most of it. Then, I had to go to a different school, so I got a new teacher and oh god... I felt like I was at primary school again. She couldn't even pronounce the words properly (and I'm not talking about her accent, she just read the words like she felt that day!). She even targeted me, I had to answer most of the questions and I got them right, because they were EASY. Sometimes I felt like she wanted me to fail one of her questions just to feel better, but who knows. I hoped next year I would get a different English teacher, because there were three and only one of them was good. But of course, my luck wasn't great. The new teacher was awful. At least, the previous one had spirit, but this man hated everyone and everything. He would ask the class and I'd answer, because no one else would, and I got so many bad stares from him. After graduating high school, I went for one year to the official languages school in my town, but they just let me skip A1 and A2 (everyone who passes high school can skip those). Our B1 class was an interesting one, with people who were from 18 to 60 years old and with totally different levels of English. Out teacher liked to explain everything quickly and then get to the exercises and practice, but since other students didn't know (or didn't remember) the theory from previous lessons, we had to go through it again, and again... One good teacher after so many bad ones and we still have to go slow. I was tired so I made friends with two 40 years old ladies my mum knew and I taught them individually while the same student asked the teacher the same thing over and over, and we got some laughs too. After getting my B1 certificate, I went to university, we didn't have English, I took the B2 test anyway and since then, I haven't been in an English class.

I'd recommend using complementary colours to create shadows, and blend the colours adding a few layers of each colour instead of one layer of each putting a lot pressure, so it looks more even.

I normally go to college in the evening, but that one was on lunch time, so I hadn't eaten yet. So I was heading to the bus stop near my house, sending texts to one of my classmates telling her I would be there in ten or fifteen minutes. I was also listening to music, I remember it was my Twenty One Pilots playlist.\n\nSo I got to the bus stop. At first I was alone, so I leaned on the bus stop sign because the street was really narrow and I had a stone wall behind me. After a few minutes, more people came because the bus would arrive soon.\n\nI noticed something. Suddenly, I started to feel dizzy. I took off one of my earphones, 'Lane boy' was playing. I looked to my side, it felt like the world was in slow motion. I stopped seeing, it all went black and I stopped hearing.\n\nIt felt like I was 'out' for a second, because I started hearing some voices distantly. At first, I didn't understand what they were saying and didn't know who they were. I couldn't see anything, it took me a few seconds and when the image was clear, I was confused as hell. I was lying on the ground, using my backpack as a pillow. There was a young man with glasses and a young woman talking about calling an ambulance, which she did. They noticed I was waking up, they asked normal stuff like how I was doing, but words didn't come out of my mouth. Then they told me what happened, I passed out and fell. More people came, one of them bought me a banana and a bottle of water. \n\nThe bus came and most of them left me, I stayed with the young man I mentioned earlier. The ambulance came, I had enough time to finish my banana (even though I really dislike bananas). They took me to the hospital and, meanwhile, I texted my friend telling her that I wouldn't make it to class because I was on an ambulance. Then I casually told my mother but she freaked out anyway.\n\nThe doctors thought I passed out because my blood sugar was low. Next day, I didn't go to class. My leg hurt, I thought it was because I fell the day before. Next day, the leg hurt more, but it was the weekend so I bought a ticket and went back to my hometown. I went to see a doctor because the pain would only increase. They thought it was nothing and gave me muscle relaxants. A few days and a few visits to the doctor later, the pain was unbearable. Just the feeling of the floor touching one of my toes would feel like a thousand needles though my skin (I wish I was exaggerating).\n\nFinally, in my last visit to the emergency room, one doctor asked for an sonography in that leg. I had a very big blood clot (DVT) in my leg and I passed out because I had a tiny pulmonary embolism which could have killed me. \n\nBut I'm ok now.", "created_utc": "1589382583.0", "edited": "False", "id": "fqhqw0g", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_gir9wh", "parent_id": "t3_gir9wh", "score": "3", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i"}, {"author": "bornxntuesday", "body": "Try contacting Rockstar.\nMaybe you bought it on Steam and you're trying to launch it from the Rockstar platform?
