On Roshar and Scadrial we see a lot of similar behavior between metals behavior in fabrials and their behaviors in the metallic arts, things like aluminium have greater cosmere purpose to them that can't be worked around, aluminum will have wierd investiture nullifying properties in all magic systems. Things like lightweaving and identity manipulation show up in many magic systems because they are underlying cosmere mechanics. Same goes for bonds and cracked spiritwebs and all that.\n\nThe second is the planet itself. Adonalsium designed most of these planets and it becomes part of their identity that the magic works within, any magic system on roshar would have to make use of spren and gems and rhythms and the like, I don't think if ruin and preservation showed up there they could make the metallic arts we've seen on scadrial work as roshar's magic system.\n\nFinally the shard itself. They have a lot of leeway to work within these boundaries and their own. I think they can break some rules but it is \"inefficient\" to do so, that staying in the rules requires less time, effort, investiture. One interesting thing is how much of the significant numbers are a choice.

The other side saying that by being a famous teacher there who is writing books with lgbt characters and is openly somewhat of an ally to the community that he is liberalizing the students/institution.

Dalinar is a Bondsmith bonded with the Stormfather. But unlike the Stormfather's previous Bondsmiths this time Honor is dead and the Stormfather is Tanavast's cognitive shadow. On top of that the Stormfather is the biggest piece of Honor's investiture in the whole cosmere now that the shard is gone. Dalinar has constantly been hearing a voice in his head saying the same thing \"Unite them\" and Dalinar has been trying to figure out the meaning of that command and it has driven all his actions through the books.\n\nFirst he is trying to Unite the Alethi highprinces, he tries to unite the humans and parshendi, he tries to unite the Kingdoms of Roshar to fight Odium. When a radiant swears an Ideal they get a 1 time bust of investiture. In the OB finale Dalinar swears his 3rd ideal and summons a perpendicularity for the first time, he says \"I am Unity\" and gloryspren swarm around him.

Wit then launches into this speech about cutting words up and putting them back together to make new words ending with \"I wonder if you could do that to a man. Pull him apart, emotion by emotion, bit by bit, bloody chunk by bloody chunk. Then combine them back together into something else, like a Dysian Aimian. If you put a man together like that, Dalinar, be sure to name him Gibberish, after me. Or perhaps Gibletish.\" - Wit. \n\nThis really sounds like Wit talking about putting a shattered shard back together and it becoming something different which with the Ado name drop seems like important foreshadowing.

In the laws of physics of the cosmere Investiture is also thrown into that equation and Investiture can be turned into energy or mass or magical effects. After Adonalsium shattered all investiture became associated with one of the new shards, even on planets never visited by a shard. The shards themselves are made of pure investiture, almost all the magic you will see is Investiture (in Rhythm of War we are introduced to anti-Investiture). \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\[No spoilers but an investiture 102 course maybe you want to figure it out yourself.\\]>!The simplest form of Investiture in SLA are the lights, Stormlight is Honor's Investiture, Voidlight is Odiums, Lifelight is Cultivation's, Towerlight is a mix of Honor and Cultivation Investiture. Enough investiture can become self-aware and this is what spren are, pure investiture that has become sentient on a scale. Cognitive shadows are another form of investiture, when something dies while heavily invested or becomes heavily invested quickly after death it can become immortal, a spren with a mortal's mind. This is what the heralds and fused are for example, other examples are the Stormfather who is Honor's cognitive shadow after he died. When enough Investiture is in 1 place you get a perpendicularity (like enough mass in 1 place makes a black hole) perpendicularities go through all 3 realms bringing them together. Dalinar summons perpendicularities in OB finale and occasionally in RoW. The Highstorm has something like a perpendicularity at least blurring the lines between realms letting new spren be seen, spheres recharged, and the Stormfather talk and show visions. Perpendicularities can be used to transition between realms like the ones in the Horneater peaks.!<", "created_utc": "1649340604.0", "edited": "1649351902.0", "id": "i3rjqyc", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_tyc1l9", "parent_id": "t3_tyc1l9", "score": "2", "subreddit": "Stormlight_Archive", "subreddit_id": "t5_2sq9v"}, {"author": "FieryXJoe", "body": "But Trell is a character in White Sand (published after BoM) which makes the idea that the old Trell was just independently made up over a thousand years ago on Scadriel unlikely.

The game doesn't glorify any of whats going on nor does it admonish it. The purpose of the game isn't, nor should it be to teach moral lessons or moralize history. The fact your wife honed in on colonialism and none of the rest of it would do more to show the lens she sees the world through than anything in the game. The game is all about war, does it glorify and promote war? Should the game constantly shove how awful war actually is down the players throat? The game lets you play a horde and reform the mongol empire, should it rub in your nose how destructive the mongol empire was? Is this offensive to nations like china that were victimized by these tribes. Could say the same about pirates, forced religious conversion, genocide, human sacrifice, the slave trade.  \n\n\nNo paradox game should be trying to convince anyone of any viewpoint about history. Lets use Hearts of Iron for example. If a fascist plays HoI is it the developers job to explain to them why fascism is actually bad? Same goes for Communism, should the developers rub the players face in the idea that communist economies are destined for failure, or how awesome communism is? You get to drop a nuke on New York City if you want and wont mention anything about it, is that the game glorifying nukes, is this offensive to Japan?  \n\n\nAs others have said, would be very interested to hear how she thinks the games should treat colonialism, colonizers and the colonized.

Constantinople is a level 3 fort (level 2 + 1 capital bonus) and coastal which all slow it down.\n\nThe mechanic in the game roughly works like this. When you are sieging a province you'll see a % and a green progress bar. The % is the chance the siege ends when the green bar fills. If it doesn't end the green bar filling will cause a dice roll that causes an event, this can increase the %, breach the walls, damage the attackers or defenders. Forts have a garrison based on their level and you need 3x that many attackers for the siege to progress.\n\nSo some things that can speed it up...\n\n 1. Like you said, a blockade helps a lot, your navy has to be on the ocean tile with the provinces port which you can visually see on the map. For Constantinople it needs to be in the strait not the black sea. \n\n2.

There are interactions in the siege screen, if you have enough cannons or ships involved you can spend 50 military points to boost the % and create a breach.
