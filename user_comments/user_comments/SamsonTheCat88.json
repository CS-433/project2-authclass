For instance my father-in-law's name is Homayoun, and English speakers will sometimes call him KHomayoun in a misguided attempt to pronounce his name authentically :P \n\nBut then they'll also do a similar problem in reverse sometimes, like with the name Khosrow.

In general, they're advocates for something called a [Steady-State Economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steady-state_economy), and they base their economic views around a competing economic field called [Ecological Economics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecological_economics), which basically rejects a *ton* of the economic assumptions that are made by other economic viewpoints (like the views held by the Liberals, NDP, and Conservatives). This isn't as much of a fringe thing as it sounds too, there's a [Canadian research society for it](https://cansee.ca/), there's an [international society for this](https://www.isecoeco.org/).

And also if we think they're actually good ideas, then why not cut out the middle man and go with the party and the people who actually believe in them, rather than another legacy party that is picking them up because they're suddenly on the public's radar, but who don't actually care about them.\n\nKeep in mind also that in the European Union about 10% of the elected seats are made up by members of [various European Green parties](https://europeangreens.eu/), and the pitch that they've made to voters about how to organize the Union for the future is pretty radically different than any of the other ideological party blocks there.

My best guess is that this is because the existing big parties have so much media control that they're able to basically define the Greens for them, whereas any attempts by the party to actually define itself gets drowned out both by folks repeating the idea that they're just an environmental issues party, and by the other big parties trying to claim that they \"have environmental platforms already, and so the Greens don't need to exist.\"\n\nThis is something that David Suzuki has actually been talking about since he started stumping for the Greens a few years back.

I've mostly traveled in the \"developing\" world and had minor issues but that worst has always been in places that *should* have had their shit together.\n\n* I had to rebook a flight while trying to get home from Frankfurt, and I booked with one of the ticket booths in the Frankfurt airport. They took my money and then just didn't book the flight. I showed up the next day to board and the travel agent had printed me out a ticket, but had never bothered to actually book it with the airline. The airline was very confused, and the desk that had sold me the ticket was closed, employees nowhere to be found.\n* In Montreal, again on the way to Germany. They kept us on the runway for 3 hours, then eventually cancelled the flight entirely at 2:00AM. They got us off the plane and made us go BACK through customs, because they'd checked us through before boarding (even though I'm Canadian and I'd never even left the country). But the airport was shut down so they didn't have enough customs agents to check us back in, so it took literally 3 hours to clear the plane back into the airport. Then they didn't have enough shuttle drivers to get us all to hotels, cause the airport was closed. So it took until 7am for me to get to a hotel... only to be turned around 3 hours later and shuttled back to the airport for the replacement flight. Biggest airport fuckup I've ever experienced.\n* Flying from Canada to Glasgow, with a very short stopover in Manchester. On the tarmac in Manchester someone drove the stairmobile into the side of the plane, which grounded the craft. They made us wait 3 hours on the runway before abandoning the flight, and then put us all on a 5 hour bus ride to Glasgow instead. It should have been a 40 minute flight.\n* Air France just straight up canceled my flight home from Port-au-Prince to Canada, and my travel agent managed to reroute me through Guadeloupe (which is fully part of France, and you would think would have it's shit together). Upon landing in Guadeloupe Air France cancelled my *new* replacement flight home as well, which stranded me in a country that I'd never even planned on being in as part of my trip. They kept us at the airport for about 15 hours before eventually shuttling us to a resort for a day and then getting us on a replacement flight.\n* in Los Angeles airport, I was stopped by security and intensively questioned about \"what I was doing in America\" when I was just in the airport trying to catch a connecting flight. I never wanted to be in America, but they insist on being hubs so it's really hard to avoid passing through. Almost missed my flight, as I tried to explain to a power-hungry TSA agent that I didn't want to be in his country and that I'd very happily leave if he'd let me get to my gate.  \n\n\nMeanwhile I've done little local flights and/or passed through land borders in Haiti, Cuba, Myanmar, Cambodia, Vietnam, Indonesia, Papua, Tanzania, Malawi, and Peru... and didn't have any issues with beurocracy or airport/border fuckups whatsoever.", "created_utc": "1660153304.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ijqvfq1", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_wkvz58", "parent_id": "t3_wkvz58", "score": "2", "subreddit": "travel", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh41"}, {"author": "SamsonTheCat88", "body": "He was pretty clearly fishing for admiring praise, and he hooked completely the wrong fish.", "created_utc": "1660151695.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ijqr1jc", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_wjmss2", "parent_id": "t1_ijnouzk", "score": "2", "subreddit": "LateStageCapitalism", "subreddit_id": "t5_39qgx"}, {"author": "SamsonTheCat88", "body": "I think you have a moral obligation to contribute more to society and the world than you take from it.

There would be ample opportunity at the start of the movie to show the setting, and to show how a regular person lives in the Empire. They'd hear oodles of propaganda and we'd see signs of the worship of the Emperor and all that, but the protagonist would be searching for purpose in his life. Somehow he'd run afoul of a Genestealer cult, which was offering him power and wealth and a way out of his shitty hive world life.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut there'd be a fantastic horror moment when it was revealed to the protagonist who the Cult actually was, and they'd nearly by killed in the reveal.  \n\n\nAt that moment we'd finally introduce the first sighting of a Space Marine. I imagine the moment being that an Inquisitor would arrive onsite with a Deathwatch marine in tow, and our first view of the Space Marine would be just this insanely fast blur of clanking metal, as this giant burst into the scene and obliterated the Genestealer Cult in just a whirlwind of over-the-top violence. Really drill it into the audience how inhumanly powerful the Space Marines are, and how unimaginable they are to a regular human.  \n\n\nThe movie's audience-surrogate protagonist would then get press-ganged into the retinue of the Inquisitor, who had arrived to try to investigate the Genestealer cult. The rest of the movie would be the protagonist getting introduced to the greater world of 40k through hanging out with the Inquisitor and his retinue (which would include our Space Marine pal, as well as a Psyhic and some other weirdos).  \n\n\nBy the end of the movie the audience would have a fair introduction to many aspects of the setting.
