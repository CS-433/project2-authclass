Trying to better my reading and picking up new words along the way. I\u2019m not really doing much more\n\nFlash cards can only get so far. I think they can help with idiomatic phrases used everyday like \u201cgibt es\u201d for \u201cthat is\u201d as well as just pure word learning, but for structure, reading is prob the best way to go\n\nFor Spanish, even though I\u2019m at a low level, I\u2019m reading Harry Potter. Well above my level, but the intensive reading is letting me see a bunch of new words as well as seeing sentence structure. Yes, it\u2019s a slog and slow (1pg/ 10mins), but I love the Harry Potter series, so it doesn\u2019t feel bad at all. Plus, I know I\u2019m not reading for the entertainment, but for the studying and learning. It prob isn\u2019t a method for everyone, but it can\u2019t hurt to try. Find A book series you love and try it (I suggest e book if possible as they should have a native translation function.
