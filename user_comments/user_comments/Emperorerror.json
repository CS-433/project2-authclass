I appreciate your open-mindedness. You can find information about this from so many places, but just to pull up a random article, there are plenty of examples as to how ridiculous it is in here, and you could find plenty of more information on the topic.\n\nI'm guessing you haven't lived in California, but it's essentially a joke that literally everything is labeled with a Prop 65 warning. Grab your peanut butter, prop 65. Buy a chocolate bar. Prop 65. See a label on your bicycle. Prop 65. I don't know if any of those examples would actually get the label, but fundamentally it's that the prop is useless because it contains so many things labeled with the warning harmless or even good for you.\n\nI'm not sure of the exact details, but I think one way in which this manifests is, say, if you have something that has a tiny amount of lead in it, well below a harmful level. Say, some of a spice. It will still have that label.\n\nOf course, that doesn't mean lead isn't dangerous. It's more about the the use of the warning than the chemicals on the list themselves (which, to be fair, is the way you were citing it). I'm not sure if the list itself contains chemicals that are harmless - that I am unaware of. So apologies for being misleading. Of course, the original point stands regarding alcohol - I wasn't talking about health, I was talking about making the decision in spite of the health effects. \n\nhttps://www.ocregister.com/2019/09/02/the-follies-and-excesses-of-proposition-65/amp/", "created_utc": "1624606439.0", "edited": "1624606807.0", "id": "h2z0fd0", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_o6zw0s", "parent_id": "t1_h2yug0o", "score": "1", "subreddit": "nutrition", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qoox"}, {"author": "Emperorerror", "body": "> even though it's unhealthy\n\nAlso, for the record, that is an awful source for unhealthiness.
