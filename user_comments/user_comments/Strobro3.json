For example wearing the mask of the farmer makes one a brilliant farmer; each occupation and role in society has a mask that makes one perfectly skilled and disciplined in what they do.\n\nHowever, changing masks causes confusion, disorientation, and personality change, because the mask has a soul. The mask becomes a part of you when you wear it, and you become a slightly different person. The workers do everything perfectly, with the efficiency of a machine. They never tire, become bored, or make a mistake. Nor do they talk, or fall out of step. They simply become disciplined workers. \n\nSo they aren't miserable, they get by for sure, but they aren't exactly free.\n\nIf you're born into this system, the only skills you know are attributed to your mask. You have no training, or survival capabilities outside of what the mask gives you. Your average joe is probably a farmer, fisher, stone mason, miller, or so on. Not someone who knows how to live in the wilderness. I.e. travelling tens of miles to the nearest settlement would be hard, dangerous, and maybe impossible.\n\nIf you leave the cult, you leave your friends and family behind, since everyone you know works the monastery with you. To be a member of their species, is to live under the Cult of the Masquerade. \n\nFurthermore, neighboring villages of other manlike species like the llanawen or faeron, might be warring with the cult and weary of outsiders. They may not accept cultists into their town with open arms. \n\nNow; whether the Cult would allow them to leave or if they would have to break free, depends on the leadership and specific ideologies of a given monastery. Indeed they are not monolithic. Some are more strict, or have no workers to spare, and may not allow them to leave whatsoever. Others may see it as treason, and will take their mask away, marking their expulsion from the cult, and kick them into the wilderness. Without their mask, culturally, they are as good as naked. It's a shameful thing to not wear a mask. If you consider that without the mask, they don't know how to work, and their memory is fuzzy when changing masks, they suddenly become unable or at least poor workers. So wherever they go, barring a very welcoming and helpful community, they are doomed to destitution.\n\nHowever, some monasteries will just let you leave freely. You might have your community a bit mad at you however for no longer helping provide food etc, and you would be overwhelmingly met with \"why?\" \"Why would you want to leave your home and family?\". \n\n**SHORT ANSWER:**\n\nYes, you can leave, but there's a big chance that it will go horribly wrong; and you probably won't want to either.", "created_utc": "1663600757.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ip2o2co", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_xgr679", "parent_id": "t1_ip1hxwx", "score": "1", "subreddit": "worldbuilding", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rd6n"}, {"author": "Strobro3", "body": "Not true; you could be reborn hundreds of years after you die", "created_utc": "1663548973.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ip06gln", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_xhiykf", "parent_id": "t3_xhiykf", "score": "1", "subreddit": "Showerthoughts", "subreddit_id": "t5_2szyo"}, {"author": "Strobro3", "body": "Electricity not being a luxury, with people able to own radios and televisions let alone computers in their home would be a huge deal for Alornans.\n\nAccess to information also.

The chief's rule is usually avoided except for with great issues such as murder or rape or so on. Since the chief is a stand-in for the Gods, his justice must be powerful, and severe, which is why his rule is usually avoided; but if two members of the tribe can't get along, he might have to step in. If the chief is however a bit too overzealous, the elders will replace him. The mark of a good chief is a just rule. They may have an offender's tongue tied to a beehive, they may have the witch burn or shock them with magic, or they may simply have them tied up and beaten, and in the most severe cases, exiled or killed by the warriors. In the case of an execution, the frog's body-paint, that symbolizes their role in the tribe and what tribe they're apart of, is washed away, to shame and estrange them from the tribe. \n\nThere's also the bugherds. Floppy gray gaunt figures with big noses and ears, and no taller than 5 feet in height. That live as pastoralists herding their massive beetles for bugmilk, meat, and eggs, and traders. They can teleport across the planet in an instant, which makes them great facilitators of international trade. Because they can warp thousands of miles away in the blink of an eye, no one can hope to contain or control let alone punish them. They will, however, enact their own justice on those who would harm their children or beetles, or try to steal from them. All they have to do, is grab their arm, teleport to a different continent with them, and leave them there to only maybe find their way home one day.  \n\n\nI will have more soon, but these are what I've detailed so far.", "created_utc": "1661895702.0", "edited": "False", "id": "imfxjqz", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_x1ql2n", "parent_id": "t3_x1ql2n", "score": "1", "subreddit": "worldbuilding", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rd6n"}, {"author": "Strobro3", "body": "In my town everyone calls it dons", "created_utc": "1661718096.0", "edited": "False", "id": "im65v46", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_wzu2t4", "parent_id": "t1_im4ui4j", "score": "1", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i"}, {"author": "Strobro3", "body": "Makes me want to go on a trip and visit every \u00e5 and then make an \u00e5 tierlist", "created_utc": "1661620001.0", "edited": "False", "id": "im0v028", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_wyy86d", "parent_id": "t3_wyy86d", "score": "6", "subreddit": "worldbuilding", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rd6n"}, {"author": "Strobro3", "body": "Super cool", "created_utc": "1661568582.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ilyehk6", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_wyhwlp", "parent_id": "t3_wyhwlp", "score": "1", "subreddit": "HistoricalCostuming", "subreddit_id": "t5_2ubp5"}, {"author": "Strobro3", "body": "San\u0101tana Dharma is at least a modern endonym for it. \n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San%C4%81tana_Dharma#:~:text=San%C4%81tana%20Dharma%20(Devanagari%3A%20%E0%A4%B8%E0%A4%A8%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%A4%E0%A4%A8%20%E0%A4%A7%E0%A4%B0%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%AE,and%20eternal%20way%20to%20live%22.", "created_utc": "1661557077.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ilxqhvf", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_wybgv6", "parent_id": "t3_wybgv6", "score": "1", "subreddit": "AskHistorians", "subreddit_id": "t5_2ssp3"}, {"author": "Strobro3", "body": "Cool I\u2019ll try that", "created_utc": "1661478833.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ilte16p", "is_submitter": "True", "link_id": "t3_wxvzdd", "parent_id": "t1_iltd3g1", "score": "1", "subreddit": "playrust", "subreddit_id": "t5_2xks2"}, {"author": "Strobro3", "body": "Wood house very very basic and like the cheapest lock, one door", "created_utc": "1661478759.0", "edited": "False", "id": "iltdvei", "is_submitter": "True", "link_id": "t3_wxvzdd", "parent_id": "t1_iltdicv", "score": "9", "subreddit": "playrust", "subreddit_id": "t5_2xks2"}, {"author": "Strobro3", "body": "Caviar.

How things go is entirely online and kept there, as a thought experiment. Exactly what doesn't result/go well?\n\nI wish I had a good example, but it just looks and sounds better. Don't you think that instead of making something completely new, we should look at the words English already has? For example looking at Old English, they had a large vocabulary that was dropped in favour of certain French and Latin words. \n\nWouldn't a version of English that uses these English words, be more representative of English, then simply making new ones? I dislike the implication that the English language never had ways of expressing these terms, because it certainly did. Why build anew, when you can revive what is already english?\n\nWhen you make new words from the vocabulary that remains, things become very difficult, you might need a few words to describe something like a motor, or electricity. \n\nFurthermore, when you make new words, there's really any number of ways to do it, whereas when you base it on historic roots, it narrows down the possibilities, and makes it feel more justified. When you apply a historic basis, there becomes a clearer direction to take. It's not definitive, but just having some basis for generating words is helpful. For example, you could overset 'poor' as 'bad off'  or 'unwealthy' BUT, if you consider that there was an old english word 'earm' which would be rendered 'arm' in modern english, and the modern German word for poor is 'arm', is strikes me as much nicer and much more justified because it fits with the historical vocabulary of english and other germanic languages.\n\nThere is no objectivity to Anglish, it can be whatever you want, BUT, when you prioritise what constitutes a word, rather than just going with anything, it makes it easier to make a decision. \n\nWhat this ultimately ties into is what you want out of Anglish. I like English that resembles Old English and other Germanic languages.\n\n>Either way, this is just preference and taste. There's little accounting for that.\n\nIt is down to taste, but I cannot help but feel like I could convince you that this is a better system.\n\nHere was a recent post that may illustrate what I'm trying to get at:\n\nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/anglish/comments/snv5fw/the_ills_of_wordforword_oversetting/\n\nThe style of the Anglish moot is similar to what you propose, where words can be made out of thin air. When you read the passage in that link in the Anglish Moot style, versus the submitters suggestion - which matches much more the kind of Anglish I've grown accustomed to, the later has a much better flow to it. \n\nThe words seem less... silly.

Here is my justification, if you care:\n\n>Just because work is automated does not mean that people will not work. UBI is nice, but generally is only enough to keep a roof over your head and allow you to shop at Walmart. It is okay, but not a great living. Or even a good living.\n\nFirstly, with automation, everything is so so much cheaper, I imagined this society to be quite a bit closer to post scarcity then we are. A modest salary in our days would allow people to live quite a bit better in 2200 by my reckoning.\n\nAs for jobs and automation, all physical labour, transportation and anything to do with money is much cheaper and effective in the hands of an automaton. I really cannot imagine that most people make any money whatsoever in 200 years.\n\n>Also, why would automation only apply to Earth? Other planets should be the same. Why would Mars be any different from Earth? \n\nAutomation appears everywhere. It's only on earth that the crash happens. \n\n>\"why would people on Mars have to work in the slave pits and not posh offices moving money around like a boss?\" \n\nThis is a complete misinterpretation of what I said. The colonies are also rich, wealthy, and live off of robots. The war happens because  they are petty and entitled by today's standards.\n\n>And Earth gets along just fine without space now. There is no reason to believe that would change. Sure things should be better with space overall, but it is not like the world would collapse.\n\nAll the  rich money making people that run the economy suddenly stop making money and a lot of them go bankrupt and major companies crash. You don't have to be an economist to see that that would be a fucking disaster.\n\nAs I said, the Earth becomes reliant on space because of how much money it makes, this doesn't  mean it's  the only economic sector, just a huge part of it that has crippling effects when cut off.  \n\n>People will find a way, so long as they are willing to be flexible.

All of the most successful and wealthy nations have off world colonies. Trillions of dollars flow in from lunar colonies, in the lower gravity and vacuum manufacturing is cheap and more effective than on earth, and industry does not butt heads with environmental restrictions as is standard on the Earth. Glass with no air bubbles, and zero imperfections, made in the vacuum of the lunar surface is stronger and higher quality than anything made on the earth. A centrifuge can be suspended by mag lev, and spin with zero air resistance. For this, manufacturing, as well as mining, makes luna an economic powerhouse. Geopolitics and economics on earth are all ultimately tied to Luna.\r  \n\r  \nWhile the nations of earth regard the moon as a symbol of wealth and progress, many on the moon look at the earth with hatred. The original two territories of the moon, Lunar America, centred on the north pole, and Lunar China centred on the south, were established in the 2040s and have grown enormously in the last 160 years. These nations were taxed heavily by their Earth governments and rebelled and underwent bloody war to be free to grow and expand on their own without the chains of \"blue\" oppressors. Not so different from how America itself once fought to be free of the british empire. Indeed the cultural standard on North and south luna is that of colonial freedom. This standard represents and existential threat to current earth powers, who would not be competitive as earth nations if not for their land claims. The ideals of Lunar Separatists and Earth colonials has become utterly incompatible. \r  \n\r  \nThe poles, which were the first regions settled, are a part of The Independent Republic of Luna, which is former Lunar American territory, and Yue Guo (Lit Moon kingdom, as in reference to zhong guo, the middle kingdom) which was Formerly lunar china. The equatorial region represents newer colonies and land claims that are clung onto by blue empires. Some nations there, such as indonesia, singapore, thailand, and nigeria, may be a surprise to people of the early 21st century, but in the coming centuries, the entirety of the world is industrialised, automated, and sees a level of wealth unheard of anywhere in modern times because of the improvement of robotics.\r  \n\r  \nAnother region of note is Danelaw, which is a shared territory by Sweden, Danemark, Norway, Finland and Iceland. By pitching in together these nations are able to get more done on the moon then if they went at it alone.

If a tribe believes a stone is special, one day it can become a literal god. As you mentioned with monsters under the bed, the fear itself stems from the darkness, so that darkness itself can manifest into monsters, though this would depend on individual beliefs, for example if a bed time story said that monsters lived between the floor boards (or some creature like the Slavic kikimora) then those floor boards themselves could yield monsters.\n\nBUT it's important to realise that the power of reputation takes a strong reputation. A handful of kids afraid of the dark doesn't yield monsters, but a whole village of kids afraid of the dark because of some story or rumour or whatever, could slowly manifest itself as claws and eyes peering out from the darkness, this creates a feedback loop until these become full fledged monsters.\n\nCulturally, as I alluded to with the bit about masks, different places have different customs to deal with this kind of thing. Many cultures ban scary stories, or have families sleep in the same room.\n\n2- There are multiple realms and planes created by different gods, you cannot create a land just by believe it's 'over there somewhere' but, if a lot of people think certain distant clouds are mountains, they might just become mountains. \n\n>do sections of the landscape get rewritten if enough people believe something should be so? if enough people were to believe in someone's fanfiction would the fictional setting of said work become real somewhere in the world?\n\nIf a false idea about a place becomes more dominant that other beings actual familiarity with the place for long enough, then yes that place can change. If a desert has a reputation for being lush and tropical, a forest begins to take over. \n\n3- If robin hood happened in this universe, every negative word said against the rich aristocracy would render them more and more cruel and evil, with enough people saying enough about them, their personalities and minds would change and corrupt, if robin hood and his merry men were loved enough and known by enough people as heroes, they would quickly rise to be great heroes and be successful, this sort of thing again creates a feedback loop. \n\n>would an explorer take one look at a new tribe, make up a neat story to tell the folks back home and suddenly said tribe grows 10 ft tall, horns, and spiky teeth?\n\nOnly if his story outweighed contrary belief. So if the neighboring tribes new that wasn't the case, and not a lot of people believed the story, the effects might be negligible. BUT if more people believed this story than there were people who properly knew about this tribe, it would start to have effect on them.\n\n>would propaganda between warring nations be enough to affect the average citizen of said nations?\n\nPower by Reputation works by strong unbalance. So two nations of relatively equal size cannot turn each other into monsters, but, if many nations hated one nation, the people there might slowly start to change. \n\nOne final point I want to make clear is that Power by Reputation also takes a lot of belief, it happens all the time but it isn't so constant that you cannot trip without turning into a legless oaf.", "created_utc": "1638897195.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hnm3lo2", "is_submitter": "True", "link_id": "t3_raqocs", "parent_id": "t1_hnk75wf", "score": "1", "subreddit": "worldbuilding", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rd6n"}, {"author": "Strobro3", "body": "Make you cry", "created_utc": "1638892312.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hnlsndh", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_rarj05", "parent_id": "t1_hnlblwj", "score": "3", "subreddit": "PhoenixSC", "subreddit_id": "t5_m6qqr"}, {"author": "Strobro3", "body": "I didn't really go into detail with china, since I don't know enough about geopolitics etc. or even just china to imagine its future very clearly.

This is a small snapshot of a project based in the far future I've been working on. I quite like ecology / animals, so hopefully this is interesting. When making this map, I took into account temperatures and moisture etc. Mars, even with SF6 warming it is still around 10 degrees cooler than the Earth on average, and as such has a temperate to arctic climate. Venus, which is the reverse case, will make for an interesting future map as well. Place names are based on the real Mars, which you might have to look up to know what I'm talking about.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**map key and info**\n\n**dark gray: glacier**\n\nThe tharsis rises so high that it dwarfs the Himalayas on earth, and for this it acts as a major rain shield and has had glaciers build up in the last millennium. It's so high that planes cannot fly over it, and as such people use space planes in a suborbital hop in and out of the atmosphere to get between the east and west. Runoff from the Tharsis Glacier feeds the Mariner Valley which ultimately flows into the boreal ocean. Also notable is Elysium, which receives currents from the south east and north west, and as such the highlands shield the eastern half of the Island, causing shrubland to develop. In these regions little life can withstand, as not even mosses and lichens can grow directly onto ice.\n\n**light gray: tundra**\n\nIn the highlands and southern reaches of Mars are regions analogous to Siberia, reaching as low as -60 Celsius during the long Martian winter. Grasses do not grow in these lands and as such the plant cover is largely mosses and lichens. Caribou are well suited to this rugged terrain and roam the southern highlands in the billions. Also found are muskoxen, yakutian  Bactrian Camels, polar bears, artic wolves, Siberian Tigers, amur leopards, wolverines, artic foxes, lemmings, voles, hares, eagles and others. In the alpine tundra in the tharsis can be found more mountain species, such as goats, eagles, and the resurrected scimitar cat, homotherium. In the low gravity, snow doesn't pack as hard, giving herbivores an easer time grazing.\n\n**brown: steppe**\n\nThese cold grasslands are less common on earth, but are similar to northern Mongolia or western Russia. They were once abundant during the last Ice age. Since there are grasses, more animals can thrive here than in Tundra. Native to these lands are horses, bison, sheep, yak, Brown bears, foxes, moose, deer, elk, lynx, as well as resurrected species such as mammoth, mastodon, wooly rhinoceros, saber toothed tigers, cave hyena, and Irish Elk. Near the sea as in the northern Tharsis or the Sirenum Sea, seals, walrus, penguins, and a number of whales can be found in abundance. Delivering many of which was quite the logistical challenge at the time of introduction in the 25th century. In lower gravity, less energy is spend lifting yourself off the ground, and as such it is easier to run much faster, as more effort can be used to propel yourself foreword. Once animals became accustomed to the low gravity, and their bodies grew taller, they could zip along quite quickly. All of these animals, including Martian mammoth, grow larger. As such the Martian Mammoths are the largest land animals in the solar system, growing taller than African elephant bulls.\n\n**orange: shrubland**\n\nShrubland is largely an intermediate between Forest and Steppe. As such, it contains some combination of animals from both, but also has a few species distinct to it. Argentinian fauna such as Taruca, Llamas,\n\n**dark green: boreal forest / taiga**\n\nComparable to Canadian forest north of Sudbury or most of Russia, made up of deciduous or evergreen trees. Animals include deer, moose, elk, grizzly bears, cougars, turkey, grouse, wolves, owls, and a great number of songbirds. Along the coast and around crater basins can be found salmon, trout, bass, turtles, cormorants, auk birds, and seals.\n\n**light green: Mixed, temperate forest**\n\nComparable to southern Ontario and New York, these forests contain a great diversity in plant life, deciduous as well as seasonal trees, and a great diversity in insects and birds as a result. Animals include deer, moose, elk, brown bears, grizzly bears, cougars, turkey, grouse, pheasant, puma, wolves, coyotes, raccoons, and owls.\n\n**violet: temperate rainforest**\n\nThere is a narrow channel in the Acidalia Sea where enough rainfall occurs year round to create a temperate rainforest similar to British Columbia or southern Chile. This is the only region on Mars with less than one a day per year average snowfall. As such the region is comparably warm and wet from the ocean currents. This is the only place on Mars that can support a redwood forest, the oldest redwoods on Mars are 800 years old, and in the low gravity, reach 700 feet high, making them the tallest trees known to exist. These forests house Grizzly bears, cougars, bobcats, deer, shrews, slugs, pudu (south American deer), tree frogs, woodpeckers, salamanders, possums, Tasmanian devil, thylacine, wallaby, platypus and pademelons.\n\n**blue: ocean**\n\nThe waters of Mars are comparable to the northern oceans of Earth. As such there are no coral reefs, but still contain vast schools of fish, whales, seals, crustaceans, squids, muscles and vast schools of shorebirds. Animal populations will vary by region. The very deepest part of the Martian seas is in the north west of the Hellas Basin, where the water can get as deep as 8km and trench ecosystems are allowed to exist.\n\n**Note:** Different regions house different animals from throughout the world, for example, most striking is Elysium and nearby Islands, which has been designated to house wildlife from Australia and New Zealand.
