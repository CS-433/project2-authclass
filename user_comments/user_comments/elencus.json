France, which is normally an energy exporter, had to become an energy importer at a time when Europe-wide prices rose due to the Russia situation. \n\nThe French government isn't responsible for other countries relying on Russia so I don't think that point is relevant, and it certainly isn't climate related. \n\nThe main point I think you could argue is that France should have invested in coal instead of hydroelectric. Fair enough. That maybe could have decreased energy prices somewhat. It doesn't change the fact that 70% of French power is nuclear, so the outage problems still would have affected them. You'd also have to investigate whether they built the hydroelectric plants because the lifetime costs are cheaper or because of climate policy specifically (I'll concede this point in your favour preemptively because I don't even know how to investigate it).\n\nFinally, electricity/heating is a big component but it's not the whole picture in inflation.

You can check this yourself [here.](https://www.fas.usda.gov/data/netherlands-government-presents-national-program-reduce-nitrogen-greenhouse-gas-emissions) Also, it's in the Netherlands and not France.\n\nAlso, more importantly, that policy isn't climate motivated. The context for the law is that the Netherlands produces way more food than it needs, and is a major net exporter. Most of their exports involve cow products, so, there are a lot of cows. Cow manure has a lot of nitrogen, which is good for soil in limited quantities. When you're producing way more than you need however, it causes huge problems for soil health as the nitrogen cycle becomes unbalanced. This can limit future agricultural production. As a result the Netherlands historically ships out tons (literally) of manure to neighboring countries. As [this article](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/dec/15/netherlands-announces-25bn-plan-to-radically-reduce-livestock-numbers) states, the motivation behind the current law stems from the fact that the Netherlands is currently violating EU agricultural and industrial regulations to prevent nitrogen soil buildup. The motivation has nothing to do with climate change. \n\nTo relate this to our situation in France, [in 2019](https://www.government.nl/latest/news/2020/01/17/dutch-agricultural-exports-worth-%E2%82%AC94.5-billion-in-2019#:~:text=In%202019%2C%20the%20Netherlands%20exported,due%20to%20higher%20export%20volume) they exported a total of 94.5B eurs. 7.7B of that went to France. Weirdly in the same year it [seems](https://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/en/french-foreign-policy/economic-diplomacy-foreign-trade/news/article/press-release-2019-foreign-trade-results-france-s-trade-balance-improves) France was also a net exporter of agricultural products so I'm not sure what to make of that--there are charts you can download at the bottom but I don't speak French well enough to warrant digging deeper. \n\nIn sum, it's an agricultural regulation law that is *not in France*, won't take effect until next year, and was not primarily motivated by climate change laws.

If you have a different favorite definition, fine, but since I was the one that made the claim that some US politicians have fascist elements, I think it best for me to explain how I use the term. It's a common list given for tenets of fascism so I think that part should be noncontroversial. \n\nAlso, I want to get out of the way the fact I haven't said any of these are *negative* traits. These traits are simply, altogether, a common definition of fascism. I'll give well-known examples across the political spectrum. \n\n1. Nationalism. This is pretty straightforward--Trump's America First policy was distinctly nationalist. I think most Republicans and some Dems too identify with some sense of nationalism. You can also point to stuff like the Obama birther controversy: make of it what you will, the controversial point was whether Obama was American enough. There was definitely a nationalist element to that. Plenty of politicians in the US would easily be considered nationalist--after all, who doesn't want to say they are proud of their country and want to put it first? \n\n2. Disdain for the importance of human rights. Also very easy. If you're Republican, it's almost guaranteed you view abortion as a violation of human rights. If you're Democrat, you likely view events such as families being separated at the border/the DeSantis migrant plane as a violation of human rights. Practically every politician supports either DeSantis' flights *or* legalizing abortion, meaning that regardless of your leaning I am confident you'll agree at least some politicians violate human rights. \n\n3. Identification of enemies/scape-goats as a unifying cause. Demoncrats are ruining the country! MAGA is a national security threat! Need I say more? This issue plagues the entire country nonstop, on both sides of the spectrum. If you want to dig into specific minority groups, I think it's easy to identify LGBT groups, BLM, or Antifa as a common political enemy for Republicans in particular. Lots of politicians echo these sentiments. \n\n4. The supremacy of the military/ avid militarism. The US as a whole has a huge hardon for the military. Nowhere else have I seen such rampant advertising for the military, eg \"Support the Troops\", TV recruitment ads, cool cars outside recruitment offices, etc. Compared to the rest of the developed world, it's quite intense. Plenty of polticians support the troops and vote in favour of big military budgets. \n\n5. Rampant sexism. Not as common as the first four. I will say I think Trump made several very sexist remarks (grab them by the p*ssy and so on) and leave it at that. \n\n6. A controlled mass media. American news is incredibly polarized and it's pretty fair to say most major TV news sources are very, very biased. Even if you agree with him, I think characterizing Tucker Carlson as \"biased towards GOP\" is fair. To give another example, I have heard people interpret the speed at which Fox News turned on Trump in 2020 as evidence that there is an element of political influence/control there. Political money and news are certainly closely intertwined. \n\n7. Obsession with national security. On the Republican side, politicians are very obsessed with border security for sure, and criticize Democrats for not being tough enough. If you look at the government more broadly, there was a national boom in caring about national security starting after 9/11 and echoing thru till now (paranoia about terrorism, etc). That was evident, for example, in Trump's Muslim ban. \n\n8. Religion and ruling elite tied together. There hasn't ever been an atheist president to my knowledge, and Christianity in particular is very prevalent in US politics. Even Biden, who is not a very religious person, loves to talk about how he's Catholic (most Catholics I know disagree with that assessment but the point is even Democrats try to play up religion). Among Republicans, Christianity is typically extremely popular and politicians regularly play this up. I think that's noncontroversial. \n\n9. Power of corporations protected. This isn't controversial either. Republicans are very pro-big business, and so are Democrats. Bernie, probably the only major non-big-business candidate that stood a chance at a Dem presidential nomination, was ousted in favour of a more corporate candidate in Biden. I don't think that is a coincidence; big corporate money and backroom deals happen all the time at high levels of politics. Both sides have huge corporate donors. \n\n10. Power of labor suppressed or eliminated. Similar to above, although not as clear since Amazon/Starbucks unionization efforts etc. \n\nI'm getting tired of typing frankly but you get the point. There's four more common features of fascism but I think I have rested my case. Maybe you disagree with particular statements I have made but I am confident you can even look in your own state legislature or senate race and find candidates that line up with 3-4 of the attributes above. Not all of them are bad attributes, according to some. You might even agree with a few yourself--I think many of these traits are distinctly more Republican than Democrat. They are all fascist attributes though by definition.\n\nEdit: rather than downvote, explain why you disagree!

Maybe I am too cynical, but I think your expectation of drivers' reactions is not well-founded. To give some background on why I disagree, most of my family and people I knew growing up are deeply conservative. This type of protest has never made a dent in their attitude over the past 20+ years. And frankly, this type of action isn't what got me out of conservatism either as I grew up.

This disagreement is purely in method. We agree on the goal. If I've understood your position clearly, you think blocking the road will potentially convince people (specifically drivers) of the seriousness of climate change, and as a result they might stop driving or might join the movement themselves. I don't think that's likely, and I think those efforts are better spent directly fighting the bigwigs and critical infrastructure which enable and promote the oil economy. In all honesty, it's not entirely black and white, and each approach has some mixture of negative and positive outcomes that can be nearly impossible to assess objectively.

She went straight for where it mattered most: the racism of the rules, and of those enforcing the rules. The famous bus boycott was similar. \n\nI think Civil Disobedience needs to target the people causing the problems and responsible for decisionmaking. I don't think people who use cars for transport are universally responsible for the problems, and they certainly aren't responsible for the decisionmaking on what kind of oil policies to set or what kind of infrastructure to invest in.\n\nYes, there are assholes who use cars when they shouldn't. I don't mind blocking them whatsoever. The issue is that there's no way of knowing someone's reason for using a car. Many people have no viable alternative in order to work or buy food, especially in the US (I know this is in the UK but still holds true for many British cities). Busses also use the roads, and this stops them as well. So do ambulances, people going to hospitals, and so on.

Highly, highly recommended to watch. Nigeria has a complex history, and blaming the British alone ignores that complexity. But the colonial legacy absolutely set the stage for much of the violence that ensued after Nigeria became independent. The Brits' mistake is similar to Burma: they repeatedly would bring very different ethnic groups together under one flag, and then promote one ethnic group to higher status than the others. Then when the colony was granted independence, it should come as no surprise that ethnic tensions would bubble up as a result of that power dynamic. In Burma this happened with the Burmese vs tons of other tribes (eg Karen); in Nigeria it pitted the Hausa and Yoruba against the Igbo. \n\nIf you want a silly ELI5 version I tried writing one below ahah: \n\nOnce upon a time a wicked queen named Liz kidnapped three children named Yoruba, Hausa, and Igbo (Biafra), and brought them to live with her on a farm. The children came from different families, spoke different languages, and so did queen Liz. \n\nHausa, the strongest of the kidnappees, liked the outdoors and spent their days herding sheep and goats in the North of the farm. They valued strong **leadership** and **rules**, and quickly became Liz's favourite. She let Hausa make rules around the house and keep a housekey on their own. \n\nIgbo, a quieter child, valued **books** and **trade**. They spent most afternoons reading in the attic or playing monopoly with friends in the village. \nYoruba, an equally important individual but not as big of a player in the story, mostly followed along with Hausa--who was, after all, Liz's favourite and the default leader of the group. \n\nOne day Liz told her prisoners, \"I think you've grown up enough. Go live freely; I've arranged for you all to live in the same house together.\" To Hausa, separately, she gave the keys of the house, saying, \"I'm sure you will be a good leader for your siblings and you can all live equally together.\" Liz basically never spoke to the children again. \n\nOver time it became clear that Hausa and Igbo had different ideas about how to run the house. Igbo, now a well educated individual with a high salary, felt it was unfair that Hausa was dictating many aspects of their lives. And so Igbo asked to leave. In response, Hausa locked the door and refused to feed Igbo until eventually, the starving Igbo gave in and agreed to continue living under Hausa's rules.", "created_utc": "1665261628.0", "edited": "1665262035.0", "id": "irjy63g", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_xyjbjh", "parent_id": "t1_irileao", "score": "9", "subreddit": "CombatFootage", "subreddit_id": "t5_2v0c6"}, {"author": "elencus", "body": "You're a bridge engineer?

I had to get a second passport which was a pain in the ass. \n\n2. When entering the UK while waiting for a visa, it's important **not** to have to need to interact with a border officer at the little border booth. If you do, there's a significant chance they wouldn't let you in if it is discovered you have a pending visa application. It's entirely at the visa officer's discretion. \n\nHow do you avoid this? Two options. Either use the egates, which are available to citizens of EU/USA/AU/NZ/Japan at pretty much any airport, or go thru Ireland overland into Northern Ireland. The second option works because of the Common Travel Area. I'm also not sure if anything has changed on the Irish border since the pandemic and brexit--best to check first.

I'd call those people Catholic if they claim to be Catholic.

German bishops across the board have united to discuss this type of issues via their \"Synodal Way\" forum. On the other hand, Pope JP2 definitively ruled out women priests in [1994](https://www.vatican.va/content/john-paul-ii/en/apost_letters/1994/documents/hf_jp-ii_apl_19940522_ordinatio-sacerdotalis.html), stating, \"I declare that the Church has no authority whatsoever to confer priestly ordination on women and that this judgment is to be definitively held by all the Church's faithful.\" Does this mean the German bishops are not Catholic?\n\nAll these groups claim to be Catholic. Many of them hold views that contradict one another. Frankly, I don't really care. If you say you're Catholic I'll call you Catholic. \n\nThe lines defining religions are blurry.

But it's not at all a \"dangerous\" place to be for the vast majority of people. I am an American; I have lived in Russia throughout much of the war and only recently moved out. I left not because of any perceived danger, but because I don't want to contribute to their economy essentially. There's no danger in day to day life in Moscow; it's like any other city would be during an economic downturn. Sure, the Russian police and bureaucracy are absolutely fucked up and evil. But no one is out there hunting down Americans to lock them up lmao.\n\nIn sum, there is plenty of good cause to criticize Russia without stooping to paranoia or speculation.

There's a lot worth criticizing about Russia, but day to day safety in major cities is not currently one of them.
