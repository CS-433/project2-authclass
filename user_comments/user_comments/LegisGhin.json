(not counting some i's or u's at the end of a word or sentence, as is extremely common with \uff5e\u307e\u3059 and \u3067\u3059) One common exception to the rule is when a \u3059 is followed by another s consonant, such as in \u9032\u3081 (**sus**ume) and \u3059\u3057 (**sush**i), because devoicing there (ssume, sshi, etc.) would make it hard to differenciate the syllables.\n\n(edit: It's only a bit tricky when you get multiple of those vowels in a row. I can't think of a good example of that from the top of my head, but if \"\u3064\u3061\u304f\u3059\u3057\u304d\"would be a word, you would of course not pronounce all vowels devoiced. I haven't found a good comprehensive rule that accurately predicts cases like that. But usually when you have two or more in a row, at least one of the vowels is often devoiced.)\n\nThis rule also accurately predicts where it's common and uncommon to \"un-devoice\" the final vowel in \uff5e\u307e\u3059 and \u3067\u3059. In \"\u3067\u3059\u304b\" and \"\u3067\u3059\u3051\u3069\" the \u3059 is followed by an unvoiced consonant, so it's very rare to ponounce the u sound in \u3059 voiced, but in \"\u3067\u3059\u304c\" and \"\u3067\u3059\u3088\" the \u3059 is followed by a voiced consonant, so there it is common (but not absolutely necessary, btw) to ponounce the u sound in \u3059 voiced.\n\n----------------------------------\n\n| * if you don't know which consonants are voiced or unvoiced in Japanese, there is a faily simple way to find out, because Japanese kana are kind of already classified by voicedness.\n\nAll kana with a dakuten accent (\u304c, \u3069, \u3058, etc.) as well as kana that can't have a dakuten (\u308f, \u308d, \u307f, etc.) are have voiced consonants.

Oni ne elektu lingvon nur la\u016d utileco. Multaj ege interesaj lingvoj ne estas \"utilaj\". Sed se estas multaj lokaj parolantoj (kiel la hispana en Usono), a\u016d multe da filmoj, muziko, televidserioj, ktp (kiel la japana), tio ja multe helpas la\u016d mi.\n\n> Kiom da jaroj estas vi studis Esperanton?\n\nUnu jaro. Mi bone regis la gramatikon post nur kelkaj monatoj. Tio estas grandparte pro tio, ke mi jam havis 10 jarojn da sperto lerni kaj analize studi la japanan, kaj mia \u011denerala kompreno de gramatiko estis tre alta.\n\n____________\n\ncorrections and explanations:\n\n>Tre *mojosa*!\n\nThat should be \"tre *mojose*\". In Esperanto adjectives ending in -a are generally only used when they describe/belong to a noun (\"o words\") or pronoun (mi, vi, \u015di, ili, and so on). Or when a noun is omitted, such as in \"la angla\" (short for \"la angla lingvo\"), or in e.g. \"mi volas la belan\" (I want the beautiful one), where depending on context \"la belan\" can be short for \"la belan floron\", \"la belan libron\", or countless other things.\n\nSo when there is no noun/pronoun (implied or otherwise) and an adjective stands on its own (\"Bone!\" \"Bele!\") or belongs to something other than a noun/pronoun it becomes an adverb ending in -e. (\"Estas agrabl**e** renkont**i** vin.\" \"Danc**i** estas amuz**e**.\" BUT \"Dancad**o** estas amuz**a**.\")\n\nIn this way it's a little different from English, where you don't say \"Beautifully!\" or \"To dance is amusingly.\" But it does have its own kind of consistent logic.\n\n> Mi studis iom da la *Kimran lingvon*\n\nYou never get the accusative case after \"da\". The part in front of the \"da\" is the thing that would carry the accusative case (e.g. \"Mi vidas tri grup**ojn** da hom**oj**.\"), but \"iom\" does not have an accusative form, so it stays the same.\n\n>Kiom da jaroj *estas* vi studis Esperanton?\n\nHere you don't need \"estas\". It's just \"Kiom da jaroj vi studis Esperanton?\"\n\nI guess you might have made this mistake because you were thinking of \"how many years *did* you study Esperanto\". If so, note that \"did study\" are both together translated to \"studis\".\n\n>La *ekzistanta* de multaj parolantoj ne estas kial lingvoj estas do *bona*, mi pensas.\n\nIt should be \"la *ekzisto* de multaj parolantoj\", because you mean \"the existence\". And of course \"bona\" should be \"bonaj\", because it belongs to \"lingvoj\". \n\nI guess probably made the former mistake because were thinking of \"the existing of many speakers\". -ing words are a bit tricky in general, because they often translate to -anta words or -i words depending on the grammatical context. I once wrote a nice explanation of this, if I say so myself, so here's some copy-pasta magic:\n____________________\n\nI believe -ing only translates to -anta when it's a \"direct\" adjective (the drinking cat = la trinkanta kato), or when it's used with a form of \"to be\" (the cat was drinking = la kato estis trinkanta).\nIn both cases \"drinking\" is used as an adjective. Compare with:\n\n> the big cat = la granda kato\n\n> the cat is big = la kato estas granda.\n\nWhen an -ing word is not right next to noun (drinking cat) nor is it used with \"to be\" (is drinking), then the -ing word is usually used more or less as an infinitive form\n\n> I like drinking = mi \u015datas trinki\n\n> stop drinking = \u0109esu trinki\n\nHere \"drinking\" is not an adjective that describes a noun. \"drinking\" stands on its own, meaning \"the act of drinking\"\n\nAn easy trick you can do to find out whether to use -anta or -i, is by switching out the -ing word for \"the act of ...ing\"\n\n* I like drinking -> I like the act of drinking. This means the same, so you use \"trinki\"\n\n* the cat is drinking -> the cat is the act of drinking. This means something different, so you should use \"trinkanta\"\n\nDo keep in mind, of course, that the \"is drinking\" construction is a lot more common in English than \"estas trinkanta\" is in Esperanto, so in many cases the last sentence would actually translate to \"la kato trinkas\".", "created_utc": "1476457016.0", "edited": "False", "id": "d8rsrkr", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_578iob", "parent_id": "t1_d8rd656", "score": "2", "subreddit": "Esperanto", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qo5v"}, {"author": "LegisGhin", "body": "Yeah, that's my first impression, too.

In Esperanto prepositions always stand in front of the word or part of the sentence they belong to.\n\nAnd you don't use the accusative case for \"la maoria\", because it is not the direct object.

Esperanto is tiny compared to English, Spanish, Chinese, Arabic, Russian, and similar heavy weights, but there are also literally thousands of small local minority languages throughout Africa, Asia, and the native populations of the Americas and Australia. Most of which have significantly less than a million speakers.\n\nIndonesia has over 700 local languages, only about 20 of which have more than a million speakers. ([source](https://www.ethnologue.com/country/ID)) There are over a hundred native languages still spoken in the US, but all of them combined only have about 370,000 speakers according to [these 2008 survey results](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Languages_of_the_United_States#List_of_Native_American_languages) (Native languages in the Americas really have it rough, sadly.) Welsh has about 700,000 speakers throughout the UK. About a million and a half speak Irish, and only 85,000 people in Ireland report using Irish on a daily basis outside of school.\n\nBy comparison, Esperanto is estimated to have about 1 or 2 million speakers, which seems about right considering there are [290,000 Facebook users](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Esperanto/112347282113529) that made the effort to list Esperanto in their profiles as a language they speak. (Of course there are also many people that didn't put it in their profile, and people that simply aren't on Facebook.) So it's likely about as large as Irish, larger than Welsh, larger than over 95% of the Indonesian languages, and larger than all US native languages combined.\n\nSo Esperanto is small when compared to national languages, but it's one of the big boys when compared to the thousands of local minority languages.
