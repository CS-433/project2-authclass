My daughter's birth parents were not uninformed about contraception or how pregnancy happens, yet pregnancy still happened. More education is great and sorely needed, but it won't solve everything. Some people have a moral stance against abortion or choose not to abort for other reasons. One of those reasons could be the difficulty of access, which is also a problem that should be remedied but is only getting worse unfortunately. Even under ideal conditions of education and abortion access, though, some adoptions would still be necessary.\n\n#2 In this particular case, when I said they weren't \"ready\" I mean that they did not want to have a child at their age and at that point in their relationship. I'm not sure either of them ever want to have kids, but I haven't discussed that with them. Having kids is a tremendous amount of work even if you have the financial resources, so I don't think it's surprising that people decide to make an adoption plan if they don't abort. Of course we live in a society where too many people end up feeling forced to choose adoption for financial reasons, and that's awful. As I said, the adoption agency offers assistance with finding resources for mothers who do decide they want to parent. Birth parents have a social worker assigned to them whose job is to explore the options and help them make the best decision for themselves under the best conditions possible. That's part of what the fees adopting parents pay are used for, not to make someone rich. (The fees are also on a sliding scale, by the way-- they're not about maximizing profit but about facilitating a process that requires the help of many professionals).\n\nThere are also laws in place (they vary by state) that give the birth parents at least a day or two after the birth to change their mind about the adoption placement. Our agency continues to support the birth mothers with counseling for free even if they decide to parent. The goal isn't to snatch up their baby; it's to support the birth mother through whatever decision she makes, including facilitating adoption if that is her choice.\n\n#3 Again, only speaking from personal experience, but my daughter's birth parents both had very strained relationships with their families (and I've heard of similar cases with people I've met). If they had wanted to place their child with a family member, they could have definitely done that. Instead, they chose my husband and I. Again, they CHOSE us. We are still in contact with them and have video chats or meetups a couple of times a year. This is supposed to be the norm with most adoptions these days except in cases where the birth parents are a risk for the child. And even in those cases, it's encouraged that the child still be able to meet with any extended family if possible to maintain those cultural connections you mention. I know someone who adopted through foster care and she takes her daughter every month to spend time with half-siblings, an aunt, and grandparents. Family is typically given priority in these kinds of situations, but if they don't want to adopt the child, then the search has to move elsewhere.\n\nI know that there are some very bad adoption agencies, especially in the United States, that run with more of a profit motive, and they should absolutely be shut down and the process better regulated. But those places (many of them religion based and focused on \"saving\" children by giving them good Christian homes), are not how the process is supposed to happen, and I don't think it's helpful to paint adoption in that way as a norm or claim that the trauma to the child is something no one is aware of; it's a reality that is supposed to be dealt with at every step of the way. I really feel like the agency we used was as close to ideal as possible, while also recognizing that adoption is never ideal.", "created_utc": "1652564438.0", "edited": "False", "id": "i8mgade", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_up5a0x", "parent_id": "t1_i8kui9z", "score": "1", "subreddit": "LateStageCapitalism", "subreddit_id": "t5_39qgx"}, {"author": "okayamerican", "body": "Adoption is traumatic, and any good adoption program will train parents to understand that reality. In my daughter's case, we have an \"open\" adoption, meaning she remains in contact with her birth parents (we can them her \"first family\" since they are more to us than just a person who gave birth and her partner), and we speak openly about her story. In her case, the parents did not feel ready for the responsibility of taking care of a child. It was a difficult decision but one that they thought about carefully, and I don't think they regret it. Yes, it was expensive, but the agency we went through is not profit based, and they offer counseling and support services for all parties involved, including support with resources for mothers who end up deciding to parent. There is absolutely no \"guarantee\" of a child, and adoptive families are chosen by the birth families after meeting at least once. The number of adoptive families on the register is limited depending on how many parents on average seek adoption placement services. So this isn't an issue of finding a supply of children to meet a demand and generate more money. The agency doesn't profit, and the fees they take are used to pay social workers and counselors.\n\nThere are certainly less scrupulous agencies out there, especially when you look at international adoptions where society-wide poverty is an issue. However, international adoption has become illegal virtually everywhere for these reasons. There are some people who have regretted their decisions or felt burned by adoption, including some adopted children whose parents hid their adoption from them or did not give the child space or support to deal with that trauma. But I believe that when done right, adoption can have a generally good outcome for all involved (without negating the fact that yes, trauma is present; our agency really emphasized that to us; they weren't just trying to paint a rosy picture to make some cash).\n\nAnd the alternative to adoption is what? Orphanages? Forcing people who don't want children to parent? Painting adoption with this broad brush of children being a \"commodity\" is harmful. It would be great if adoption and the social workers who facilitate it were supported with government funding and costs to adoptive parents weren't so high, but I don't expect that to change anytime soon.", "created_utc": "1652506033.0", "edited": "False", "id": "i8jnc0m", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_up5a0x", "parent_id": "t3_up5a0x", "score": "3", "subreddit": "LateStageCapitalism", "subreddit_id": "t5_39qgx"}, {"author": "okayamerican", "body": "You could do a graduate degree maybe?", "created_utc": "1652495239.0", "edited": "False", "id": "i8j4y8y", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_up1f1d", "parent_id": "t1_i8igdnr", "score": "1", "subreddit": "Internationalteachers", "subreddit_id": "t5_37htm"}, {"author": "okayamerican", "body": "Quick follow-up: there is an English language teaching assistant program that Americans can apply for.

There are some high up-front costs, such as paying all the fees to rent an apartment, but your school will usually give you a settling-in allowance that helps with that. But rent isn't as bad as you would think if you are flexible with your location. I don't live in central Tokyo because my school is in a northern part of the city, so I pay a lot less. But even at this location, I can get just about anywhere in 30 minutes or less. But I'm renting a two-bedroom detached house here for about US$1200/month. A two-bedroom anything in Dallas (where I lived before) for less than that was almost impossible to find (unless you were willing to live in a run-down and dangerous part of town). If you're single, you can easily find somewhere decent for $800/month. And although I'm supporting my husband and kid on one income, we've still managed to put a lot of money in savings, probably as much as we would have saved on two incomes living in Texas. That's due to not having to own a car, cheap healthcare, and how easy it is to find free or cheap things to do.\n\nIt depends a lot on your lifestyle, though. There are some things that are very expensive. Like, if you want to eat cantaloupe all the time, you're going to go bankrupt pretty quickly- haha. Eating out is also relatively expensive in general, so we do almost all of our cooking at home (generally preferable since we have a toddler, too, and restaurants  can be cramped). I feel like that's more of a matter of preference than a financial choice, though. We also don't go out to bars or clubs or anything, so if that's what you mean by having a life, then that could possibly get costly (no idea, to be honest). I have coworkers with similar family situations who struggle a lot more to save, but I haven't found it very difficult at all, and I don't feel like I'm making any sacrifices or denying myself anything I really want. This is on an international school teacher's salary, though, not an ESL teacher's. People who work as ALTs or in conversation schools make about half (or less) of what my school pays (and I'm not at one of the super high-paying ones).\n\nI think one of the major reasons Japan (and especially Tokyo) is considered so expensive is because those surveys of cost of living look at typical expat packages for people high up in multinational corporations, which doesn't really compare to the more humble lives led by international teachers. The expat packages try to maintain a \"Western\" lifestyle, meaning those people tend to live in one of the (very expensive!) expat hubs in apartments that are way bigger than what most Japanese people are used to or what is really necessary in my opinion. If you live a bit more like a local, it's very affordable! \n\nIf you look online, you can find average salaries of locals to get an idea of what to expect. My salary is roughly in line with that of the average man my age in Tokyo, or a bit higher depending on the source and how you look at it. It's common for only one spouse to work here while supporting a family, something that I think would have been impossible for my family in the States.

I feel like it's a good idea to have at least seen all of the major grammar points, even if you haven't totally mastered them (the mastery will be assisted a lot by the reading anyway). The book was easy, juicy, and about 100 pages, which helped motivate me to finish it. It gave me a huge sense of accomplishment to be able to finish a complete book written for native speakers.\n\nI did the same thing with the first book I read in Spanish (Harry Potter, which I had never read in English): I looked up EVERY single word I didn't know, wrote it down in a word document, then added it to an SRS program and studied the words before moving on with my reading. It was time consuming in the beginning, but a lot of that vocabulary is recycled, so by the time you get halfway through the book, your reading speed and comprehension will improve quickly. There are also a lot of vocabulary words that you encounter in fiction that are rare in other genres of writing (words like \"chortle\" or \"grimace\" or \"sigh\"). I ended up learning a lot of words that people might not consider particularly useful, but if you're aiming for fluency comparable to your first language, you will eventually need all of those words anyway, so I didn't consider it wasted time. Sometimes that one obscure word can be the key to understanding something you're reading too, so it all helps.\n\nWith any book, though, the first few chapters will take some extra work because you have to figure out certain words the author uses and what's happening, so if you can make it through the beginning, it will get easier as you keep going. This is still true for me, and I'm on my 30th book in French right now. If you love reading in English, you will be able to persevere I think.

Since you live in the US, you absolutely don't need to worry about English. And since that's the language you and your wife use to communicate with each other, your child will have that reinforcement at home anyway. If you're serious about teaching another language, you will have to be very committed and strategic. Unfortunately, it doesn't happen casually. Putting a kid in front of a TV program in another language, for example, won't do anything if they don't have a human being they regularly interact with in that language. It will just sound like gibberish to them. Maybe they will be able to pick up a few words or phrases, but that's it.\n\nA common strategy is One Parent, One Language (OPOL), where each parent speaks a single language with the child at all times. The \"at all times\" part is really crucial because many children will resist the language and want to default to what's easier (English in this case). They won't make the effort to learn unless they feel the language is absolutely necessary for them. The fewer languages, the easier this is to manage. So if you want to just go Portuguese, that's fine. If you want to do Portuguese and your wife Farsi or Ukrainian, that will allow your kid to grow up trilingual. But you have to be very conscientious and strict, and you will have to bring in outside resources to build vocabulary beyond the basic words used for daily life in the home. Once the language is established, then TV and movies can have a benefit. Reading books can also have a tremendous impact, and sometimes you can find playgroups with other families who speak that language, which is even better.\n\nThere are a lot of books and support groups online, so definitely seek those out.

Unless you're at a very high level, I don't think that matters, and the teachers I had were wonderful and very effective. The Lake Atitl\u00e1n area was also very laid-back and beautiful, with great weather, restaurants, and accommodation. I liked studying there best.

I had studied Spanish before, but my brother went from zero Spanish to conversationally fluent, and we were there for about a month. He was 13 years old at the time. \n\nAs always, though, results vary by person. I met people who had been attending those schools for more like 6 months and made very little progress. A lot of people just wanted to party, so they spent a lot of time drinking, skipping class, and hanging out with other students. My brother and I studied and drilled vocabulary every night, and I did a lot of intensive reading outside of class hours. My Spanish still isn't perfect, but I feel confident about my level and think my time in Guatemala had the biggest impact on my success (if for no other reason than it allowed me to prioritize learning Spanish for an extended period of time). Also, just as a bit of extra information, I didn't get much from my homestays. The families were mostly interested in earning cash, and I didn't interact with them so much (they had lives of their own and we're paid more to provide room and food, not to be our best friends).\n\nSo it's impossible to answer your question definitively, but the right kind of person can make significant progress in one or two months. It's more about dedication that anything else, though.\n\nEdit: just to add to this, I also did group French classes at a language school in Paris and didn't get nearly as much out of it. I had a good teacher and the class size was small, but one-on-one was significantly better, especially for speaking practice. You can't hide or keep quiet when you don't feel confident about something, and you won't be slowed down by other people who don't know certain words or grammar points.

Especially Spanish (French and German programs are being cut all the time). As a Spanish speaker, there are also some good opportunities working as a bilingual teacher in elementary schools. But you will need to also take education classes and get a teacher's certification. The language alone wouldn't be enough.\n\nFor Korean and Japanese, teaching isn't really an option. There might be a few posts here and there, but they'll be very rare. You could find some translation work if you're lucky, but that generally won't pay very well unless you can pair it with a technical skill such as engineering, medicine, law, etc. Translation work does exist, but it's not as lucrative as many people believe, especially if you don't have a technical writing degree or other skills.\n\nIf you want to get a Ph.D. in the language, you have some options teaching and doing research at the university level, but that's a commitment of 10+ years, it isn't for everyone, and jobs in academia are cutthroat and few and far between as well.\n\nMy advice is to double major. If you're really passionate about Korean or Japanese, then go ahead and study them and do your year abroad. There are lots of opportunities to teach English in Japan and Korea, so you could spend more time there, improve your language skills, and really become fluent while earning a decent living.

To be totally honest, I'm not actually that interested in SPEAKING languages. I don't really enjoy meeting new people that much, and I'm more interested in reading books and watching videos in my target language. Depending on your needs, that's totally valid. Lindie Botes has an interview about this topic that really helped me feel more comfortable with accepting this about myself: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAYM5rrLwnQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAYM5rrLwnQ)\n\nThat being said, sometimes you NEED to speak a language (to pass a proficiency exam or for work, travel, etc.). If you really want to improve your speaking skills without having to meet a bunch of random people, I think it can totally be done. These are my tips for socially anxious language learners from most anxiety-inducing (#1) to least (#3).\n\n1. For me, talking to a tutor on iTalki (or similar sites) makes me less anxious than talking to language exchange partners. I think it's because I'm actually paying someone, so the pressure  I feel (due to anxiety) to be interesting or cool or whatever is gone. They're getting something from the conversation (i.e. my money) no matter what. If I'm boring or they can't understand me or I say something really stupid that insults seven generations of their family, at least they're still getting paid. Tutors are also almost universally kind and patient people who do their best to make you feel comfortable. If I'm talking to strangers, that's always more difficult (especially since one of my target languages is French and French people can be really intimidating!). That being said, even talking to tutors can make me anxious sometimes, and the cost can add up. Which is why I recommend...\n\n2. Record yourself speaking. You can achieve a pretty high level of passive knowledge through a lot of input and vocabulary study, but that doesn't always transfer automatically to speaking (despite what some people like to claim). The problem is usually that you can understand what other people are saying, but you can't find the words or the grammar to say what you need to when it's your turn to talk (you have passive, not active knowledge). But you can practice making this knowledge active without necessarily having another person directly in front of you. Just give yourself some topics and make a recording of yourself talking for a certain amount of time. You could also prepare in advance by looking up some words you know you will need beforehand so you don't struggle as much when it comes time to speak. Honestly, this can be a lot MORE effective than having an actual conversation because you have time to stop and think and prepare. Obviously you can't do that in a \"real\" conversation, but with enough practice actively speaking, that problem will go away because you've taken your passive knowledge and made it active. \n\nA lot of people recommend talking to yourself throughout the day, which is great, but a recording helps you to go back and analyze problem areas, get help when you run into trouble, and track your progress. After a month of recording yourself talking, you can go back to your first video and see how you've changed; this is great for a higher level because often the changes happen too slowly for us to realize them and we become demotivated. If you can post your video on YouTube or a website like HiNative to get feedback on pronunciation, grammar, etc., that's ideal. It's much less pressure than a live conversation, and you can still get your corrections that way. If posting a recording makes you too anxious, I still think you can make a lot of progress just by forcing your brain to actively pull up the vocabulary you need to use (especially if you're getting a lot of input).\n\n3. If opening your mouth to speak still makes you too anxious, you can still improve your speaking skills by writing. Just like reading can help your listening skills and vice versa, writing and speaking are both output and are complementary. So you can practice responding to writing prompts, journaling, etc. You will still need to move your mouth to develop the muscle memory for pronunciation, so you should also read aloud what you wrote (and preferably record it so you can listen to it). Again, asking native speakers to correct your writing (or recording) will also help.\n\nI really think it's possible to be decent at speaking without having to have a ton of conversations with strangers. In fact, sometimes talking to strangers is a waste of time because it takes a lot of work to find someone you enjoy talking to who can actually help you with problem areas. And you have to get past the initial phase of \"where are you from, what do you like, how old are you, etc.\" which becomes redundant really quickly. And if it's a language exchange, half of your time is spent in English, so that also takes away time from using your target language.\n\nHonestly, if you have social anxiety, speaking will probably always be your weakest skill no matter what (it is for me), but that's okay: everyone has their individual strengths and weaknesses. For example, I've met English language learners who have a LOT of confidence and will talk to anyone even though their grammar is a mess and sometimes it's difficult to understand what they are trying to communicate. A lot of them will continue making the same mistakes for years and years because they never study grammar and never read in the language. I think that's totally valid if it serves their purpose. And if you prefer to read and study grammar and you don't speak so well, that's also totally valid as long as you're able to do what you want to do with the language.", "created_utc": "1595749911.0", "edited": "False", "id": "fza7bnt", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_hy1x3z", "parent_id": "t3_hy1x3z", "score": "8", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "okayamerican", "body": "I live in Japan, so that's why I'm learning Japanese. I can tell you that there are a LOT of opportunities here for foreigners, and Japan is increasing the number of foreign workers they are allowing in to work. The economy here might not be the most vibrant, but it's still the third largest in the world, and there are people here from everywhere opening businesses, advancing in their careers, and enjoying the safety and high quality of life here. It's a great place to live, especially for kids (I have a two year old daughter). I wouldn't want to raise her in China, frankly, and I think we have a better life here than we did in the US. So learning Mandarin wouldn't have been useful (it's actually what I was studying before I got this job), and learning Spanish wouldn't help me find a job in a country where I would make much money (I already speak Spanish and have looked at opportunities in Mexico).\n\nI had some of the same misconceptions about weeaboos before I came here, and I can tell you that there's some truth to that, but it's not the whole story. Yeah, there are a lot of foreigners here who are obsessed with anime, but there are also plenty of us who aren't. I'm not, the majority of my coworkers are not, and actually I don't meet many people who are (I guess they stick together somewhere else). You didn't mention anything about Japanese culture except otaku stuff. Japan is full of interesting history, art, literature, cinema, beautiful nature...it's not hard to find something for anyone. I live in Tokyo, the largest city in the world.\n\nAlso, what exactly is the point of questioning someone's desire to learn a language in the first place? If someone wants to learn Old Church Slavonic or Cherokee, good for them! And if people like anime, good for them too.
