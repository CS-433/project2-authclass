You can certainly use it to learn on your own, though it is designed to be used in a classroom as it includes conversation exercises and pair work.

Pronouncing e and o as diphthongs is a big giveaway that you're a native English speaker. Another giveaway is turning your unstressed vowels into schwas.\n* Aspiration: Hold your hand about 15cm from your face and say the word 'spin'. Keep it there and say 'pin'. You should feel a puff of air when you say 'pin' but not 'spin'. This puff of air is called aspiration and it happens when English speakers start a word with /p/, /t/ or /k/ sounds. Italian speakers don't do this.\n* Sounds that don't exist in English: There are 3 consonants that English doesn't have in its inventory - /r/ (the rolled R or alveolar trill), /\u028e/ (the GL sound) and /\u0272/ (the GN sound).

It's like when you make the 'brrr' sound associated with being cold by forcing air through your lips. Instead of forcing it through your lips, though, you're forcing it between the tip of your tongue and the alveolar ridge. The alveolar ridge is the hard bit of gum behind your teeth, where English speakers made the 't' and 'd' sounds.\n\nI spoke Italian for 8 years before I managed to make the trilled r sound. I even did a phonetics course at university where we were supposed to learn all the sounds in the human phonological inventory. I learnt to make clicks, implosives, ejectives, all kinds of unusual sounds, but I couldn't master the alveolar trill!\n\nI watched a few Youtube videos last year and unfortunately I can't find the one that got it to click. Perhaps it wasn't a video but one of the articles I was reading. I can't really remember. This is what I remember of what helped me, though:\n\nYour tongue should move up towards the alveolar ridge but not actually touch it. There needs to be a gap for you to force that air through.\n\nIt helped for me to lean my head back. Gravity brings your tongue into the right place a bit.\n\nIf you can make the alveolar tap, which is the very quick 'd' sound in a General American pronunciation of water, try doing that while forcing the air and see if you get a bit of a vibration going in the tip of your tongue. Once you feel it, you know the position your tongue should be in and it will get easier.\n\nHopefully this will help you a bit.

It's my hypothesis, then, that magic is about concentrating your intention and that speaking an incantation helps in this process, especially when learning. When a witch or wizard invents a spell, they do so by using the incantation they think goes best with the intention of the spell, and this will vary by language. The spell goes on to be taught to others and remains the same over time.\n\nI definitely think most Europeans would use the incantations we see in the books, which are largely Latin or Greek based, as you mentioned. It's interesting that Avada Kedavra is based on Aramaic and might represent an Asiatic influence in western magic.\n\nIt's my opinion that spells will have been invented at the same time in different parts of the world and have different incantations there. I just can't see the students in Mahoutokoro in Japan chanting Latin incantations.

That's fine, that's exactly what it means. But then mudblood was also translated as *mezzosangue*. They're not the same at all. For someone who would use those terms, the difference is all-important.\n\nIt's a major part of the plotline when Harry is safe from the basilisk because he's a halfblood (*mezzosangue*), but Hermione isn't because she's muggleborn (or mudblood, as Draco called her, *mezzosangue*). Later on under Voldemort's regime, muggleborns (*mezzosangue*) are trying to get out of trouble at the Ministry by saying they're halfblood (*mezzosangue*). The whole thing made no sense at all. Thankfully, that was cleared up in a more recent translation, where mudblood was translated as *sanguemarcio*, or rotten blood.\n\nAs a translator myself, I think there's always a benefit to reading a text in its original language. While we always do our best to translate as closely as we can, there are inevitably points where the text will have to differ. For example, the choice to translate names is a difficult one. J.K. Rowling often puts meaning into a character's name. If you keep the name the same, you're faithful to the original, but the reader of the translation won't necessarily understand that \"Snape\" is intended to be close to \"Snake\", or that \"Sprout\" means a plant that is just starting to grow. If you translate the names, the reader understands the meaning behind the name, but the original sounds and \"Englishness\" is lost, which is important in its own right, because you lose something the author put there.", "created_utc": "1413110915.0", "edited": "False", "id": "cl78pfb", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_2j0nkh", "parent_id": "t3_2j0nkh", "score": "23", "subreddit": "harrypotter", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qiqi"}, {"author": "amyosaurus", "body": "Harry wasn't a true Horcrux.

First, sex education isn't available in all Muggle schools. People still work it out! Secondly, just because we don't see it in the story because it wasn't something J.K.

Just because they're not Unforgiveables doesn't mean you wouldn't be locked up in Azkaban for murdering someone.\n\nWe don't have any information about the laws on powerful love potions like Amortentia.

Things had to get extremely bad in Chamber of Secrets before the Ministry interfered.\n\n2) I think anyone with sufficient experience would be able to take the position. Foreign qualifications for other magical schools would likely be just as good.\n\n3) I think certain jobs need more intensive training than others. You can't walk right into being an Auror, but doing something more office-based would probably be something you could more or less go into right after school.\n\n4) I think it's a combination of the two. Arthur's position doesn't seem to be one that is seen as very important. The size of his office is testament to that. Having seven children will also put a strain on the finances. Although food can be multiplied according to Gamp's law, and things can be *reparo*'d and handed down, there are a lot of other costs that they must have had.\n\n5) Wandmaking seems to be highly specialised. Ollivander and Gregorovitch aren't the only wand makers. Ollivander was considered to the best, though, because he pioneered the idea of the wand choosing the wizard, rather than the wizard demanding a wand with certain characteristics, or bringing in their own materials. [Pottermore]\n\nI think that magic was probably very erratic until the invention of wands as a focus for the power. After all, only the best wizards can perform wandless magic.\n\n8) Well, we know that there is Quodpot, which is more popular than Quidditch in the United States, but that's all J.K. Rowling has given us in the way of wizarding sports. We know that squibs play muggle sports, particularly Angus Buchanan was a famous squib who played for the Scottish national rugby team. [Pottermore].\n\n9) There is a Wizarding Academy of Dramatic Arts [Beedle] so it seems more than likely that theatre is popular in the wizarding world.\n\n10) Magic.\n\n11) Since there is only one all-wizard community in Britain (Hogsmeade) it's probable that wizards buy homes from muggle estate agents.\n\n12) I think it's likely that other countries have their own currencies.\n\n13) This is an interesting one about the nature of spells. It seems that pronouncing the incantation correctly is extremely important, as a minor mispronunciation can result in drastic consequences. None-the-less, spells can be done non-verbally. When someone invents a new spell, how do they do it?\n\n14) I think the war against Voldemort was very internal to the UK. The war against Grindelwald was on a much larger scale.\n\n15) Yes, we know of several fiction authors. There is  Beedle the Bard, of course, and Beatrix Bloxam who wrote \"purified\" version of his stories. Fifi LaFolle appeared as Wizard of the Month on J.K. Rowling's old website.
