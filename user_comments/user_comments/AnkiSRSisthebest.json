My observations are as follows:\n\n\\- A \"fast\" game on 19x19 with any reasonable level of reading (10-20 seconds per move) would take 30-60 minutes, which is really long by modern gaming standards. This is a huge time commitment for a single win for any casual/intermediate player. \n\n\\- Most players that I play with on Fox don't come anywhere close to using the time alloted to them fully (i.e. they prefer to play fast). \n\n\\- Fast time settings seem to be fairly mainstream/popular on chess and other abstract strategy games. Correspondence games represent a minority of games/players.\n\nBased on the above, I think the 19x19 board is far from being maximally interesting for a modern player audience. I think promotion and embrace of 9x9 and 11x11 formats with flashier graphics or interesting variants (like Batoo) would be much closer to maximally interesting for most humans as its non-stop action and a game with thought put into each move would take only 6-20 minutes. It is also a format that can be comfortably played on your phone.\n\nI think 19x19 and larger board formats become maximally interesting only at a very high level. I personally am 6 kyu on Fox 1650 on GoQuest and I still find 9x9 to be a lot more fun than 19x19, although I still enjoy the occasional 19x19 game when I am feeling very strategic and have a lot of time to sink.", "created_utc": "1640571361.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hq3imjr", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_rp85a8", "parent_id": "t3_rp85a8", "score": "5", "subreddit": "baduk", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhqe"}, {"author": "AnkiSRSisthebest", "body": "Same thing about his mandarin.

This changed in 2012, when the Smith-Mundt Modernisation Act authorised the US government to start spreading propaganda on American social media platforms like Reddit, Twitter, and Facebook.[3]\n\nShortly thereafter in 2013, Reddit revealed that Eglin Air Force Base has become the \"most Reddit-addicted city\".[4]\u00a0Eglin Air Force Base is a U.S. military base that has been known to \"study\" how to establish majority views and social control.[5]\n\nIn 2014, the US military launched additional research into how to control and weaponise people's emotions via social media.[6]\n\nThat same year, The Intercept revealed that ZunZuneo, the platform that was literally operated by US intelligence agencies, is only a \"drop in the bucket\".[7]\u00a0The Intercept published several top-secret documents by US and UK intelligence agencies, proving that they are manipulating American and foreign social media platforms for the purposes of \"propaganda\", \"deception\", \"mass messaging\", \"pushing stories\", and \"alias development\".[8]\n\nIn 2017, the Oxford Computational Propaganda Research Project found that the US was one of the only countries using a sophisticated combination of automated bots, human shills, and a blend of both (what they call \"cyborgs\") in order to spread propaganda on social media.[9]\n\nThat same year, scholar Alfred W. McCoy of the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison, who had previously exposed CIA drug trafficking operations in Southeast Asia,[10]\u00a0revealed that the US is not only spreading propaganda through social media but also collaborators in mainstream American news outlets.[11]\u00a0He linked these collaborators to Operation Mockingbird, a US intelligence operation that had previously been exposed for spreading propaganda through mainstream news media by compromising journalists.[12]\n\nThe Guardian - Revealed: US Spy Operation That Manipulates Social Media\n\nAssociated Press - US Secretly Built \u2018Cuban Twitter\u2019 to Stir Unrest\n\nBusiness Insider - The NDAA Legalises the Use Of Propaganda on the US Public\n\nReddit - Get Ready For Global Reddit Meetup Day, Plus Some Stats About Top Reddit Cities and Languages\n\nUniversity of Florida & Eglin Air Force Base - Containment Control For a Social Network With State-Dependent Connectivity\n\nThe Guardian - US Military Studied How to Influence Twitter Users in DARPA-Funded Research\n\nThe Intercept - The \u201cCuban Twitter\u201d Scam Is a Drop In the Internet Propaganda Bucket\n\nThe Intercept - Full-Spectrum Cyber Effects\n\nOxford Computational Propaganda Research Project - Troops, Trolls and Troublemakers: A Global Inventory of Organised Social Media Manipulation\n\nAlfred W.

I think since Deng (I think its more debatable with the leaders before him), the CCP has been increasingly technocratic and pragmatic in its behavior. While the domestic rhetoric has certainly changed with Xi (and the rightful emphasis on \u81ea\u4fe1\uff0c\u81ea\u5f3a\uff0c pushing back on \u5d07\u6d0b\u5a9a\u5916 type sentiment that had existed in earlier years when China was not as developed), I think the CCP still runs on the exact same cold-blooded pragmatism of Deng. Xi Jinping Thought is domestic rhetoric to fit the new realities of a strong and ascendant China, I don't think it reflects a significant change to strategic thinking in international competition. In almost any country, domestic rhetoric rarely fully reflects the actual thinking of statesmen. What has changed drastically is not the CCP's thinking, but rather how desperately the US is trying to bring the CCP down. \n\nI think your characterization of US as a rabid dog is incorrect. In 2009, the US administration gave Hu Jintao a Go board as a diplomatic gift. I would liken the evolution of US-China competition as a Go game that started with the US getting a huge 9 stone handicap. Following very intelligent play from China and careless play from the US, the board looks like China is in the lead. A rabid dog will bite a man with a gun without consideration that after biting it will get shot. The United States can be as cruel as a rabid dog, but it certainly isn't as irrational as one. The US will look to use allies and rally other countries to contain China. The US has been playing terribly so far, but the game is far from over thanks to the 9 stone handicap that the United States has enjoyed.\n\n>The racial narrative is peddled by  overseas Chinese because we understand the system better than anybody  else.  We have ate, drank, and socialized with the everyday Americans.Under their superficial politeness is a black heart that secretly relishes in the Century of Humilation.\n\nI'm not denying that there is a ton of racism in American society. I agree that beneath the veneer of woke egalitarianism, most Americans have an extremely misplaced sense of superiority with respect to other countries, systems, and cultures. It is just completely misleading to portray the motivations of the Sino-American competition as the white man trying to stop the ascent of the yellow man. While the subconscious racism of a lot of Americans would also relish Commodore Perry's domination of Japan, the American security establishment is pragmatic enough to allow Japan to prosper and do great, as long as it continues to bow to them. The silent members (with respect and in contrast to loud and dumb elected leaders) of the Pentagon are better educated and have an ability to set aside their subconscious racial biases in determining the most prudent course of foreign policy. I'd bet the CCP sees it as I am portraying it, as they are not as emotionally compromised as someone who has suffered really disgusting discrimination since childhood.", "created_utc": "1615328994.0", "edited": "False", "id": "gqdrb9j", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_m18g3s", "parent_id": "t1_gqd9q6z", "score": "8", "subreddit": "Sino", "subreddit_id": "t5_38jyn"}, {"author": "AnkiSRSisthebest", "body": ">You guys do not realize how important american hegemony is for the  continued living standards and GDP of the US. How do you think the US is  capable of printing trillions of USD to escape any and every economic  crisis of their own doing? Because of the hegemony of the USD enforced  by their military hegemony around the world. It\u2019s like a ponzi-scheme.  If one world-region ends US military or economic hegemony, all others  will follow and the largely impoverished US population cannot continue  living beyond their means anymore; civil disorder of untold scale will  ensue and the US will cease to exist as a state. \n\nAgree up to here.\n\n>Hell, the full and utter genocide of the Mainland Chinese people is literally the panacea for ALL of american ills. \n\nI'd say the collapse of the CCP and the mainland's economy would be the panacea of American ills. America would prefer for China to be a source of protein (aka a subservient consumer market or manufacturing colony). The economic impact from the disappearance of a 5th of the world's population would not benefit the US, and I seriously doubt anyone who's anyone in the US security establishment wishes this.\n\n> In the coming war, no one will be spared. The US will sacrifice every  single non-american for the good of their own people. We need to realize  that we cannot disconnect the existence of the American people from the  existence of their hegemonic state. American lives, the survival of  Little Timmy living in Wisconsin, depends on Chinese people dying in  pain and misery for the sake of continued american hegemony. \n\nBoth the US and China are ruthlessly pragmatic: there is no guarantee that there will be a war as both sides are doing fairly well to deter the other side. Security publications from the US (such as RAND, among many others) acknowledge that US military confrontation with China in the Pacific would hurt the US more than China, and no one is interested in the conflict horizontally expanding into the enemy's mainland if it means that their mainland could be damaged as well. I think you are emotionally jumping to a conclusion, \u51b7\u9759\u4e00\u4e0b\u3002  \n\n\n> The Chinese-American Conflict is a deeply personal and deeply racial conflict. There are no innocent bystanders. \n\nYou are definitely over-racializing things here. While I don't deny the existence of influential politicians in the US with deeply racist biases, the United States only cares about maintaining its hegemony (like you pointed out earlier). The US is ruthlessly pragmatic: they are fine with Asians prospering (look at Japan, South Korea, etc) so long as they call the shots. China is one of the few countries in the world (like Russia) that doesn't kneel to the US. I feel like a lot of people that peddle the racial narrative in this conflict are overseas Chinese that are projecting their resentment from racial discrimination they may have experienced where they reside.\n\nAs for the \"reset\": As the article correctly points out, I think this just means a return to a more pragmatic approach to competition, essentially acknowledging that while they are both doomed to competition, there are areas where mutually beneficial cooperation is possible.", "created_utc": "1615318858.0", "edited": "False", "id": "gqd4rec", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_m18g3s", "parent_id": "t1_gqcf1i9", "score": "14", "subreddit": "Sino", "subreddit_id": "t5_38jyn"}, {"author": "AnkiSRSisthebest", "body": "White has 40 + 7 komi  = 47 points.

Even the ones that do it for some strategic benefit are not anywhere as near as bad as the Nazis. The Nazis' plans included mass genocide of the local populations.\n\n> Camps designed for specific ethnic minority\n\nPlease don't construe my statements below as defending re-education camps, I think forcing anyone into a camp for any reason (ethnic or otherwise) is terrible.\n\nI think what separates these camps from what Nazis did (or what the English or Germans did during their colonization of Africa) is that they actually intend to forcefully assimilate the population as opposed to eliminating it. I think the geopolitical dimensions of the camps are often ignored: it was documented by an ex-State Department employee (I need to find the source, I read it 3 years ago) that ethnic Uyghurs had in fact crossed and fought for Islamist proxy forces in the Syrian conflict. China is a hotbed of different ethnic groups that have been previously incentivized/supported by foreign forces (Source: here is one example: https://www.colorado.edu/anthropology/sites/default/files/attached-files/mcgranahantibetscoldwar.pdf, you can also read \"Legacy of Ashes\" by Tim Weiner and \"Politics of Heroin\" by Alfred McCoy for more examples) to separate from their government. It would be reasonable of the CCP to suspect that adversary governments (such as the US) would jump at any opportunity to have an armed Islamic insurgency destabilize China's holdings in the West. The CCP is not driven by a desire to ethnically cleanse Xinjiang, it is just worried about the potential for Islamist ideologies to take root and destabilize them.\n\nGiven the above, I think the best comparison to these camps are Japanese internment camps, although I would say this camps are more benign, as they at least have plans to re-integrate the captives into normal society.\n\n> Persecution of religion on a large scale\n\nSo the Nazis attacked Jews (and some other religions). They did not attack religion in general. Actually this is more a characteristic of Soviet communist regimes.\n\nI am not defending prohibiting people from practicing their religious beliefs, this is just communist more than it is Nazi.\n\n> State Censorship\n\nAll states engage in some level of censorship (including the US). It is far from being something that you would use to identify a Nazi. Communists do it, a lot of autocracies in the gulf do it, and even western liberal democracies engage in it from time to time.\n\nIn short, the reason why the Nazis were terrible was mainly due to their indiscriminate killing of millions of innocent civilians to perpetuate a narrative of racial superiority.

For an issue like this the CCP is scared that publications could stoke anti-government activity that could make the situation harder to control, and they are wary of foreign funded research being weaponized to foment discontent. All in all, despite this policy of censorship, the scorecard of the CCP in containing/controlling COVID  was *arguably* (this is a highly politicized topic) better than a lot of richer democracies with stronger freedoms. Inability to publish research to the broader public without approval should not be misunderstood as inability/fear to publish, but rather that researchers need to be careful of optics and political positioning within  their research.\n\nWhile your example is very valid criticism, I just fail to tie it to the idea that lack of freedom of speech is a major structural impediment to creating a culture of technological innovation. In practice, I have a hard time imagining researchers are going to be scared to publish in strategically important fields (such as AI, computer chips, quantum computers, weapons, etc) as these are not mildly susceptible to the optical political considerations that COVID research papers had during the outbreak, so I don't think that your example is a good one when it comes to understanding China's ability to innovate in technology.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n> The second problem is that internal academic corruption in China is  absolutely rife, largely due to intense pressure to publish, and a  general culture of cheating in highly competitive Chinese academic  institutions. \n\nThis is true, although I doubt the culture of academic pressure is attributable to lack of freedom of speech. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>The third problem is the malign influence of the CCP and its ideology  (unfortunately often transmitted through its students) on foreign  academic institutions.
