I use the site Reverso context to help determine if something I'm learning really is common. 'J'aimerais quelque chose' means 'I would like something', but if I type 'I would like a' in Reverso, I see many many more examples using \"je voudrais un\". So, my active card is to learn 'je voudrais quelque chose', and I make a passive cards for 'j'aimerais quelque chose'.

If I want it in my active, I'll go English \u2013> Target language, because then I'll practice actively producing it. If I only want it in my passive vocabulary, I go Target language \u2013> English. This more or less mimics me coming across the target word while reading and needing to understand what it means. \n\nMy cards are stripped down to only test one thing. I only have enough context to avoid ambiguity.

If it's an idea I want to be able to convey, and I don't already have a way of expressing that same idea, then I add it to my active vocabulary. \n\nThis system is amazing for handling synonyms. I find the most neutral, common way of saying something, add it to my active vocabulary, and then make synonyms as passive cards. This system is also great for really uncommon, higher register words. I want to recognize them, but I don't want to torture myself by forcing myself to recall them actively.\n\nI hope this all made sense.

If any pseudosynonym has enough nuance that I feel I should have it in my active vocabulary, instead of just passive, then I'll make another L1\u2013L2, providing the context that would require its use instead of the other word.\n\nEt au temps pour moi !
