It really helps.\n\nI think I have several ideas about this living alongside each other in my brain. But I must say I\u2019m not that adventurous yet with swapping out nibs or tuning them. I occassionally try my hand at doing that with my cheaper chinese pens, but am not confident enough to make that a big part of my hobby yet.\n\nAs for price/nib ratio: I can love cheaper pens with \u201cok\u201d nibs a lot. I love my Kaweco Sports for instance. Tho I do always feel a bit guilty when those get expensive but don\u2019t upgrade in nib. I can justify my Kaweco liliput fireblue because the design is amazing but somewhere I still wish it came with a better nib. I prefer using my sailor pgs, platinum 3776 and pilot vp as daily drivers over my mid-range pens that have an ok nib.\n\nI think the benu briolette looks amazing. But I\u2019m just afraid I will regret it like some of my mid-range pens that have the same nib as the ones in the lower range. But at the same time I think I\u2019ll also regret not having one of those funky looking pens in my collection.\n\nI for instance have an amazing and outrageous looking vintage soyuz pen with a ruby and an engraving of the Kremlin on the cap. But the pen body is just a Parker 54 with a so-so gold nib. But it\u2019s still one of my fav pens because I just enjoy having such a pen in my collection and it makes me happy every time I see it! And in this case the not so amazing nib doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nApologies for the long comment btw but I\u2019m just thinking aloud.

But ofc I wont get fit by doing those things.\n\nLastly: another issue I have is that until plusmin my 24th I\u2019ve been always thin without putting much effort into getting fit and because of that people always assumed I was fit (which I wasn\u2019t obv.) so I could always avoid working out and avoid the fact that I\u2019m just not that good at sports. The last few years I do have to watch what I eat and work out to have the body I feel comfortable in (tho I\u2019m still relatively thin) so now I suddenly have to face those insecurities I have been avoiding all my life.

Grief often makes you feel lonely and isolated and it\u2019s indeed true that it\u2019s strange to think things will get better in the future. It also wont in the sense that your loved one is gone and will never come back. But it will get better in the sense that you will grow as a persone and, little by little, learn how to live normally although your dad isn\u2019t there anymore. It will never be the same as before, but trust me: at some point you will stop feeling like shit all the time (took me 2 yrs and still have ups and downs).\n\nAbout friendships: it\u2019s harsh but this experience made me categorize my friendships in 3 categories \u201cgood friends that showed empathy when I needed it most\u201d (some did or at least tried), \u201cshallow friendships that are fun but they will never understand\u201d (I still hang out with these but I\u2019ll never get as close), and \u201cpieces of shit that couldn\u2019t get over their own awkwardness and aren\u2019t worth my time\u201d. I ended some friendships because of this and grew closer to the people around me who showed empathy (or at least did their best). It\u2019s ok to let go of people. But I have to add: the loneliness is a thing. My boyfriend had been 100% supportive, my brother and dad experienced exactly the same as I did, and yet it often feels that I\u2019m alone in this world with these gigantic feelings. This feeling wont go away that easily and it takes time to heal.\n\nMy advice: categorize your friends but don\u2019t be too ruthless, we\u2019re all flawed humans. Invest in the people who try to be there for you and actually tell them that you appreciate their help/love/friendship. And lastly, concerning feeling horrible and lonely all the time: take it a step at a time. Give yourself time. Don\u2019t sit there and wait untill you get better, live by the day and try to do what feels best for you. Grief is a lifelong struggle and the goal isn\u2019t to heal but to learn to live with it in a way that suits you.

Women are the \u201cprize\u201d to attain, and men are the actors with agency who are pressured into attaining that prize in a certain manner. So in this case men aren\u2019t objectified because their self worth depends on a factor they can influence as they have agency. Women, however, are nothing more or less than the thing men do something with (aka sex) to loose their virginity with.\n\nPatriarcy is the main problem in this situation because there remains an imbalance between the role and agency of the man and the role of the woman. For the woman patriarcy is bad in this case because by having sex with her a man can increase his self worth. She objectified because this is her only function. For the man patriarcy is bad in this situation because there is pressure put on him to attain the prize asap (loosing virginity by having sex with a woman) and when and how he does that influences his worth compared to other men. However he is still an actor with agency who has influence over the situation. And the situation also revolves around HIS virginity. Because the idea is that he is better/more masculine/more successfull/etc when he isn\u2019t a virgin anymore. And that is something he can (try to) change.\n\nYou could argue that women have the power in this situation to accept or reject men. But in the end it all comes down to whether the man is succesfull in loosing his virginity. So it the end it still revolves around the man and therefore this is a result of the patriarcy/toxic masculinity. Rather than that it\u2019s a problem where men are being objectified. However, these high expectations and specifically the fact that we believe that men have so much influence over the situation (aka that they are failures if they don\u2019t attain the prize) makes this all extra hurtful towards them specifically because women are objectified (aka \u201che didn\u2019t do his best if she says no,\u201d or \u201cthere must be something wrong with him\u201d).", "created_utc": "1630015126.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hahabfw", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_pbxfvl", "parent_id": "t1_hah34ua", "score": "1", "subreddit": "TooAfraidToAsk", "subreddit_id": "t5_2ssp7"}, {"author": "kleineoogjes", "body": "Nolty maybe?", "created_utc": "1630011401.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hah1h5t", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_pc16kc", "parent_id": "t3_pc16kc", "score": "3", "subreddit": "PlannerAddicts", "subreddit_id": "t5_360su"}, {"author": "kleineoogjes", "body": "Objectifying the woman does not make the woman the main victim in this case.

Cut out the shape. Traced the shape on some soft and relatively thin leather. Cut out the shape out of the leather with an exacto-knife. Realized it was about 20% too small for my type of skates (this is an estimation). Hated myself for not testing the size with paper.\n\nThen I enlarged the pattern roughly for 20% (this too is an estimation, I was too lazy to measure), printed it out again. Cut the new pattern. Tested the paper pattern on my skates. Cut off the parts that might touch the wheels. Traced the shape twice on leather. Cut it out. Put the loose flaps on my skates, with the toe-stop already through the hole I cut in the leather flaps. Measured where the laces would go through the leather and where I had to sew the flaps together. Marked that with a white posca marker. Took the flaps off the skates. Punched holes for the laces. Glued the flaps together according to my markings. Punched sewing holes on those spots. Sewed the flaps together there to make them replicate the toe of the skate boot. And they were ready!\n\nI hope you can follow this explanation, I can imagine it feels quite random. I did all this with a diy leather set from aliexpress. I got the leather from a local fabric market. I must note that I\u2019m quite crafty so for me it\u2019s no problem to just randomly do some things and still have a satisfying result.

I get that it feels harsh for her that you are telling her to work or finish her studies. Especially because she is filled with anticipatory grief, anxiety, wild emotions, etc. and she practically feels as if she really cannot do these basic things like work and studying. And I respect that, I have been in exact the same situation. Grief is paralyzing and takes ages to deal with accordingly. But what I realized is that, although I believe accepting and dealing with your feelings and taking the time to do that is absolutely crucial \u2014 trying to maintain your regular life, only if you only manage like upholding it for 10 to 20% is also helpful. It keeps you from spiralling downward and it makes the feelings of guilt towards your main support (in this case you) smaller what betters the situation and makes life easier once you finally crawl out of the toughest stages of grief. My boyfriend ended up doing most of the house work and paid about 65% of the bills in my darkest times, and even then I had difficulties evening that out eventually and not be draggrd down by guilt towards him. But I managed to return to normalcy in the end because I always kept a tiny bit of \u201cnormal life\u201d in my grief life. I hope your girlfriend will open her eyes and start to understand this. But it\u2019s difficult because she is probably now going through the worst time of her life and she doesn\u2019t have the mental space to even think about this.
