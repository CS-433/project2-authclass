Dutch being close to English (which many Germans also know) probably also helps. I also feel like Dutch spelling is a bit more consistent.\n\nI don't know whether it's true that Germans are familiar with low German and therefore understand Dutch better. This should also be true the other way around with Dutch people being familiar with eastern dialects.\n\nGermans often have more problems understanding spoken Dutch than the other way around. Dutch is typically way less articulated than German. It's also a less literal, more ideomatic language, which can be confusing.\n\nLastly, I think a lot of Germans who look at Dutch and say \"how funny, I can understand all of this\" overestimate how accurate their understanding is.

A lot of people will thus fall back into their native language without thinking about it and you'll feel left out.
