Native speakers have strong grasp of things like slangs, nuances, when to use filler words, cultural references that many non-natives who test at the C2 level don't have.  A native speaker can usually tell if someone is non-native (unless they started a language during the critical learning period).  In terms of reading and writing, I do agree that some learners are better prepared than natives because there are some native speakers who are not very educated.  However, I feel that the reading and writing level of highly educated native speakers that did all of their education in their native language would be higher than C2.  For example, students in China would spend high school years learning classical Chinese texts/poems written thousands of years ago.  A C2 exam in Chinese would definitely not test something that difficult.  A highly educated native English speaker would've read many Shakespeare plays in high school.  A C2 test in English would not prove that you can read at that level.  So basically what I'm saying is that I don't disagree there are learners who have a finer command of the language than natives but the proportion of native speakers who are not at a C2 or higher level is much smaller than what some people think (unless we're talking about a country with high illiteracy rates).", "created_utc": "1663060148.0", "edited": "False", "id": "io8h6o3", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_xcfxqr", "parent_id": "t1_io765wh", "score": "1", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "CriticalLifeguard804", "body": "The number of times I've had to debate people who tell me that \"There are native speakers who are not at a C2 level\" is truly annoying.

I have the impression that French people say they don't see race and not talk about it while assuming the problem is bigger in the US because Americans talk about it a lot, so it gives the impression that the problem is bigger there when in reality it might not be the case.  Second of all, in the United States, sticking with only ethnicity is too complicated because it's a country of immigrants and therefore being American is not an ethnicity.  If you asked an American his/her ethnicity, that person might respond with something like 40% German, 20% Dutch...etc.  Most Americans are a mixture of many ethnicities unlike in France where a good amount of people can just say they're ethnically French.
