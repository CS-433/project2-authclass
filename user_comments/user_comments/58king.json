Only one. You already know what it is. The reason it takes years to be effective is because language is *hard*. We are literally the only creature which does it (barring the primitive forms of animal communication of which there is much academic debate. But nothing else does it like we do it).  \n\nI don't want to compare adults to children too much as I do think children's brains are different, but think of how long it takes a child to start forming sentences competently in their native language. It even takes them years and they are 100% immersed in it and they have all of the advantages of high brain plasticity.  \n\nSo yeah of course if you only spend 3 hours per week (which really is very low) then you will be shit after 4 years unless your language is closely related to another that you know. Language learning is a massive commitment.  \n\nFrankly I don't think it can even be compared to other skills. With other skills you learn by doing, but with language learning you learn by consuming/understanding.
