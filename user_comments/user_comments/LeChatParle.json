[{"author": "LeChatParle", "body": "So I definitely do recommend idiom books, but obviously just learn to recognize them and understand them, and only use the ones you\u2019ve heard natives actually use. Some are exceedingly rare and formal\n\nI\u2019ve personally made over 1000 flashcards for chengyu. The average native speaker can recognize about 8000 chengyu, and the top 1000 represent the majority of the ones you\u2019ll see in daily life. \n\nAs a note, many native speakers mistakenly think they don\u2019t use chengyu often, but they just aren\u2019t thinking about it. I\u2019ve noticed it before and talked to natives when they use it, and they didn\u2019t even realize a certain phrase was a chengyu. With that said, chengyu are more flowery and formal, so most will be in written media only\n\nI disagree with the advice that you shouldn\u2019t go out of your way to study them. Chengyu should be treated like any other Vocab word. There are over 20,000 chengyu and 8000 are common. You will not learn these by osmosis\n\nBelow is a research paper in Chinese detailing facts about chengyu.

Fifth? Fifth zone cannot be described like this. It takes on four different pitches depending on the preceding syllable (see Wikipedia link below under section on neutral tone)\n\n> second tone - low\n\nCan you explain why you think this?\n\n> third tone - long\n\nI think this explanation is going to be worse than down-up because you\u2019ve failed to include any mention of pitch. In fast speech, both first and third essentially become high and low respectively, so if you just pronounce any 3rd tone syllable as long but don\u2019t mention pitch, you could be pronouncing the first tone. Also, 3rd tone is only longer when it\u2019s either stressed or at the end of the sentence and the full down up sequence is performed. All other cases, it\u2019s equal in length to other syllables \n\nSame issue for your fourth tone one. Also, I don\u2019t believe there is any scientific evidence to suggest mandarin tones are short or long other than fifth tone, and tone does not alter vowel length. All non-fifth tone syllables should be pronounced with approximately the same length in speech\n\nIn my view, the best explanation of tones is high, rising, low, falling, and then the fifth tone which unfortunately cannot be easily summed up, but \u2014 all but the third tone when followed by a fifth tone will be lower in pitch than the proceeding tone. For a third tone - fifth tone pair, the second syllable is higher in pitch; but this could be easily thought of as being similar to third tone sandhi\u2019s euphonic alteration of successive low tones \n\n###Recommended reading  \n\nDuanmu, San. 2007.

If you're worried about urinary crystals, there exists litter than can check your cat's pH. If their pH is too high (basic), then you can add cranberry supplements or vitamin c or methionine. Evolution Diet has some cranberry treats available.\r\n\r\nOne study looking at vegan cats even found that \"No ... significant deviations from normal values were observed. In particular, lower values of iron, protein or vitamin B12 in vegan cats were not observed\" (Knight & Leitsberger, 2016).\r\n\r\nThe term obligate carnivore is only relevant when talking about wild animals because it's related to their nutrient requirements in a diet they could naturally acquire in the wild, but because we can give cats supplemented and appropriately designed food, it's not an issue in domesticated animals (Knight & Leitsberger, 2016). I personally recommend Evolution diet, but below are links to several different companies you can research yourself.\r\n\r\nI've also linked a number of studies backing the use of vegan cat foods and dog foods, but here are two quotes for people who don't want to read the studies.\r\n\r\n\"[A] significant and growing body of population studies and case reports have indicated that cats and dogs maintained on vegetarian diets may be healthy\u2014including those exercising at the highest levels\u2014and, indeed, may experience a range of health benefits. Such diets must be nutritionally complete and reasonably balanced\".\r\n\r\n\"Wakefield and colleagues (2006) compared the health of 34 cats maintained on vegetarian diets for at least a year, with that of 52 cats maintained on meat-based diets for at least a year. There were no significant differences in age, sex, body condition, housing, or perceived health status, with most cats described as healthy or generally healthy. These results are hardly surprising, when we consider that animals need specific nutrients, not ingredients. There is no scientific reason why a diet comprised only of plant, mineral and synthetically-based ingredients cannot be formulated to meet all of the palatability, nutritional and bioavailability needs of the species for which it is intended\" (Wakefield et al., 2006).\n\n###References\n\nBenevo \u2013 Animal friendly animal foods. http://www.benevo.com/\n\nV-dog Vegan Dog Food | Healthy Dog Treats | Vegan Dog Chews. https://v-dog.com\n\nVegan animal diets: facts and myths. https://www.vegansociety.com/whats-new/blog/vegan-animal-diets-facts-and-myths\n\nAm\u00ec pet, food.

Speculatively, it may be that inefficient methods are why one might see the lower number. If so, that only furthers the need for an efficient teaching method to be in place.  Webb and Nation (2017) also show evidence to state that L1 learners on average learn about 1000 lexemes a year, but L2 learners only 500-1000 lemmas.\n\nIt should be noted that these are indeed averages among students being studied for research and may not be the same results you get. However, it's a good place to base your flashcard studies. Now, you're probably wondering the difference between a lemma and a lexeme, unless you've studied linguistics before; I'll also mention the phrase \"word family\" here too. In the context of linguistics, a word is a single, discrete unit of writing. \"is\" is one word. \"to be\" is another word.\n\nA lemma is a discrete word used as the reference for a set. \"to be\" is the lemma of \"Is' and \"are\". Therefore, a lemma represents multiple words containing a base meaning, but not words that are inflected or words that contain affixes.\n\nA lexeme is a set of words that fall within one lemma and also include inflections of that word. For example, \"to kill\", \"kill\", \"killed\" are all one lexeme.\n\nFinally, a word family is all permutations of a lexeme, including affixes. For example, \"to do\", \"do\", \"does\", \"did\", \"re-do\", \"doing\", \"undo\", etc.\n\nAll of this is to say that if you're studying flashcards, you could probably aim for 1000 word families per year as a safe bet of words to master. Unfortunately, then we have to understand the word \"master\". You've mastered a word once you can hear, use, write, and understand a word in its various non-archaic/outdated uses. Mastering is hard and is different from memorizing a word from flashcards, thus you could probably \"memorize\" a list of flashcards many times faster than you could master them. This leaves you with the decision of how fast to go.\n\nIf you want to aim for 1000 word families per year mastered, then you would probably aim for 15-20 new flashcards per day, in addition to the other forms of studying you use. If you're okay with not mastering them at the same rate that you memorize them, then you can probably safely double this number to move more quickly. Find what works for you around this number and adjust as you see fit. There's nothing wrong with going at a slower pace if need be either\n\n**References**\n\nWebb, S. (2020).

English speaker generally do not use these forms in formal contexts \n\nIf you have any specific questions, I\u2019d be happy to answer them!\n\nhttps://www.alt-usage-english.org/pronoun_paradigms.html\n\nhttp://hull-awe.org.uk/index.php/Verb-endings_in_older_English", "created_utc": "1650665271.0", "edited": "False", "id": "i5t0ctl", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_u9bvm1", "parent_id": "t1_i5ss5km", "score": "2", "subreddit": "Eldenring", "subreddit_id": "t5_122hf1"}, {"author": "LeChatParle", "body": "Taking it one time and not having a bad experience does not invalidate all the times people have had bad experiences.", "created_utc": "1650660924.0", "edited": "False", "id": "i5sqfyg", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_u9gup7", "parent_id": "t3_u9gup7", "score": "1", "subreddit": "TwinCities", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r7ar"}, {"author": "LeChatParle", "body": "You conjugated both verbs, but make sure to only conjugate the first one. \n\nWhy do you run?\n\nWherefore dost thou run?", "created_utc": "1650653966.0", "edited": "False", "id": "i5s9jzj", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_u9bvm1", "parent_id": "t1_i5rp04v", "score": "5", "subreddit": "Eldenring", "subreddit_id": "t5_122hf1"}, {"author": "LeChatParle", "body": "Yep!

Organizers said on social media that they plan to deliver more complaints to City Hall at noon Friday.\n\nThe complaints come as Frey \u2014 two months into his second term \u2014 is facing renewed criticism of his handling of the Minneapolis Police Department after an officer fatally shot 22-year-old Locke while executing a no-knock warrant in connection with a homicide investigation. Locke's death re-energized a national debate about banning no-knock warrants and led local activists to call for the firing of the officer who fired the fatal shots, and the resignations of Frey and interim police Chief Amelia Huffman.\n\nPolice wrote in court documents unsealed this week that they had requested a no-knock warrant to ensure officer safety and preserve potential evidence in a St. Paul homicide investigation. Minneapolis SWAT officers stormed into the Bolero Apartments on Feb. 2 yelling \"Search warrant!\" without knocking, police body camera video showed. Locke was asleep on a couch under a blanket, and he stirred after an officer kicked the couch. He had a gun in his right hand and was shot within seconds.\n\nThe ethics complaint focuses on three areas. It says Frey and Huffman \"intentionally and recklessly misrepresented the facts\" of the case, including when the Minneapolis Police Department referred to Locke as a suspect four times in a news release. No records indicate that Locke was thought to be involved in the homicide that prompted police to execute the no-knock search warrant.\n\nThe complaint notes that Frey has authority over the Police Department under the city's charter and says he \"has violated and continues to violate his duty to the public in allowing this murder to go without discipline and discharge.\" City officials have said Mark Hanneman, the officer who shot Locke, was placed on paid administrative leave after the shooting.\n\nThe ethics complaint also says there was \"a massive failure to exercise judgment to further the best interest of the city\" when Minneapolis police insisted on a no-knock search warrant, despite St. Paul's initial application for a standard warrant that would have required officers to announce themselves.\n\n\"This lethal failure to exercise appropriate discretion led to the extrajudicial execution of Amir Locke, an innocent man, and added to the existing community trauma from the ongoing excessive use of force by the MPD,\" the complaint says. \"The Mayor is in control of the Minneapolis Police Department and must be held accountable for its ethics violations, both in the case of Amir Locke, as well as in the case of the various other police brutality violations of his MPD.\"\n\nFrey's office hasn't yet commented on the complaints.\n\nIn keeping with its typical protocols, the city said it will dismiss duplicative complaints and in the end review just one.\n\nThe city's ethics officer, Susan Trammell, will conduct an initial review and can dismiss any complaints that are \"duplicative of another complaint, untimely or not meriting further investigation on their face or solely involving aspirational sections of the [ethics] code.\"\n\nIf Trammell dismisses a complaint, the city's Ethical Practices Board \u2014 which consists of people appointed by the county's chief judge and the deans of two law schools \u2014 can uphold or reject her decision. If the board sustains the complaint, it provides recommendations for sanctions and refers the matter to the City Council. The process could include an investigation and hearings.", "created_utc": "1644608205.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hwjnf18", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_sq3zry", "parent_id": "t1_hwix98r", "score": "15", "subreddit": "Minneapolis", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r3bl"}, {"author": "LeChatParle", "body": "There isn\u2019t really any support for your comments within language acquisition literature.

Sucks that you\u2019re anti science \r\n\r\nAs long as any vegan food is supplemented with those things and has a high protein/fat content and a low carbohydrate content, there's no other physical reason they can't be vegan (Knight & Leitsberger, 2016; Dodd et al., 2021; Semp, 2014).\r\n\r\nOne study looking at vegan cats even found that \"No ... significant deviations from normal values were observed. In particular, lower values of iron, protein or vitamin B12 in vegan cats were not observed\" (Knight & Leitsberger, 2016).\r\n\r\nI've also linked a number of studies backing the use of vegan cat foods and dog foods, but here are two quotes for people who don't want to read the studies.\r\n\r\n\"[A] significant and growing body of population studies and case reports have indicated that cats and dogs maintained on vegetarian diets may be healthy\u2014including those exercising at the highest levels\u2014and, indeed, may experience a range of health benefits. Such diets must be nutritionally complete and reasonably balanced\".\r\n\r\n\"Wakefield and colleagues (2006) compared the health of 34 cats maintained on vegetarian diets for at least a year, with that of 52 cats maintained on meat-based diets for at least a year. There were no significant differences in age, sex, body condition, housing, or perceived health status, with most cats described as healthy or generally healthy. These results are hardly surprising, when we consider that animals need specific nutrients, not ingredients. There is no scientific reason why a diet comprised only of plant, mineral and synthetically-based ingredients cannot be formulated to meet all of the palatability, nutritional and bioavailability needs of the species for which it is intended\" (Wakefield et al., 2006).\n\n#References\n\nAm\u00ec pet food.

Not including tone, Cantonese has 619 unique syllables. Including tone, Cantonese has 1756 unique syllables.\n\nThis is contrasted by Mandarin\u2019s 410 and 1375, respectively. This means that Cantonese\u2019s syllabic inventory is 209 and 381 syllables larger than Mandarin\u2019s.\n\nThe make-up of its inventory shows a more drastic difference in the distribution of characters to tones when compared to Mandarin. Cantonese only has 139 syllables that use the 5th tone. Mandarin\u2019s smallest in this regard is the 2nd tone, which is only used by 257 syllables.\n\nFurthermore, very few syllables are contrasted by all available tones, meaning that characters are often densely packed into the syllable\u2019s used tones, instead of being more spread out.\n\nIt is often said that Cantonese is \u201cMonosyllabic\u201d, whereas Mandarin is not; however, I have not found evidence that such a dichotomy exists between these two Chinese languages. What\u2019s more is that there is not a linguistic definition for what it means for a language to be monosyllabic. One study found that when a set of spoken conversations in both Mandarin and Cantonese were recorded, that the Mandarin conversation used about 80% monosyllabic words, and Cantonese only about 5% points more, at about 85%.\n\nFor these reasons , I would argue that regardless of whether you wish to call them monosyllabic or not, the difference between then is not significant enough to warrant a different label. I will go into more detail on this in another post once I\u2019ve finished doing research on the syllable density of Cantonese. [I plan to do a similar post as this one I did for Mandarin](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChineseLanguage/comments/ofh5zi/homophone_density_of_top_20_syllables_in_mandarin/). I will probably have this research done around spring or summer.\n\nOne character on the chart, I was unable to print due to not finding a font that could render it.
