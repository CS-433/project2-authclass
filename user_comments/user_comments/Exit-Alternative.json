I teach French. Where I live students have to take a language from grades 4-9. However, they only get 150 minutes a week. The level of language the teachers have varies (some who teach the language can't even have a spontaneous conversation). Language is usually the first thing to get eliminated if a school event has to happen. It is not prioritized. \n\n  \nHowever, students also don't put in nearly enough effort. I have students who have taken French for 9 years and still don't know colours or numbers to 20. It is not because we don't teach or use them.
