I\u2019m not sure what your situation is like but I\u2019m here to say that it will get better. You are not in an environment that is healthy right now. \n\nI don\u2019t know anything about the foster system/cps but I do know a lot about trauma and therapy. Living in a hoard is traumatic, plain and simple; I need you to remember that it isn\u2019t normal. Reddit has a history of crying \u201cabuse\u201d when it doesn\u2019t exist, but I think that from what you have said, your parents are emotionally immature. It sounds like you\u2019re being manipulated into thinking that it\u2019s your fault when it isn\u2019t.\n\nThings probably won\u2019t get better while you\u2019re still living at home, but if and when you are able to move out and hopefully see a therapist, they will slowly but surely start to get better. I know it\u2019s a long, long time, but patience is worth it.\n\nI remember being a teenager having my hoarder parent say that I had \u201ccrocodile tears\u201d and that I was the problem. Now I\u2019m 25 and happily married in a much cleaner (though not perfect) place. I go to therapy frequently and that has really helped me resolve the issues I had with my upbringing. I think that it could help you too.  See if there are any resources at your local community college or 4 year school for mental health for when you become a college student.\n\nTl,dr: YES, it does get better once you leave the hoard. Be patient, it is so worth the wait.

I feel that way when I go back home too.\n\nI will just speak from my own experience\u2014 when I lived with roommates in college, I kept the common areas clean because I knew they would have to live there too. I didn\u2019t leave out dishes or  clothes because I didn\u2019t want the other people I lived with to see them. There is an aspect of healthy fear there, I think. It got me to clean up after myself in ways I didn\u2019t before. I lived in a much more habitable space because I was afraid of being seen as messy to my roommate. Every single person I lived with made me better.\n\nAlongside the cleaning, it\u2019s much cheaper to have roommates. Living on your own is incredibly, incredibly expensive, and generally people don\u2019t account for things that come up as an adult. I have learned from growing up that $1000 isn\u2019t a lot of money (when compared to rent and bills, plus unexpected expenses). \n\nLiving on your own can make bad habits worse and set you up for a bad situation. It can be lonely. I thought growing up that I was going to live on my own and have a dog. What happens when your dog starts having digestive issues and needs to go to the vet? You love your dog, but you also might have a $400 vet bill you weren\u2019t expecting.\n\nI\u2019m not trying to crush your dreams, I\u2019m really not. Getting out of the hoard is worth it. I am just trying to be honest about how difficult adult life can be, especially if you\u2019re trying to do it all by yourself.", "created_utc": "1645469303.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hxv459f", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_sxvd5c", "parent_id": "t1_hxusb03", "score": "14", "subreddit": "ChildofHoarder", "subreddit_id": "t5_35mlm"}, {"author": "coffeeshopfit", "body": "Just because you leave the hoard doesn\u2019t mean things will automatically be cured. If it\u2019s available, I suggest going to therapy to work through your experiences from growing up. Colleges typically have counseling centers available to students included in the tuition fee.\n\nYou will likely have a hard time with roommates. This will be stressful. You will learn and adapt. Things will eventually get better. Do not live on your own just to avoid conflict.\n\nEvery single thing you own should have a home; aka a place that it goes. Getting things on sale that you didn\u2019t plan on buying originally does not mean you saved money. It just means you spent more on a thing you didn\u2019t need.\n\nOn that note, get really clear on what are \u201cneeds\u201d vs \u201cwants\u201d.

You are not responsible for your mother\u2019s feelings or actions. I can tell you want to help and that is wonderful and noble and good but you are trying to do something that you simply cannot and will not be able to do. Give up on believing your actions can influence her. They cannot. \n\nYou are a child. She is failing you as a parent, no matter how loving and supportive she may be in other areas. Those can both be true statements.*\n\nI keep trying to think back to what would make me feel better/be helpful if I was still your age. This is what I could come up with:\n\n1) She is not exhibiting normal or healthy behavior. Do not try and convince yourself that it is okay or fine as a way to cope. It is not. It may become hard for you to throw things like jars away in the future. Do it anyway. The more you can stretch your anti-hoarding muscles, the better off you will be.\n\n2) When the time comes, go to college. Preferably somewhere far enough to where you cannot live at home anymore. I don\u2019t know if your school has any counseling options, but college was the first time I was able to see an actual therapist because it was included in my tuition. Take every opportunity you can to prioritize your mental health.\n\n3) You likely have a high tolerance for mess now. You had to develop that as a way to cope. Other people do not have that same tolerance. You may eventually live with roommates and you will fight over how things are kept clean. All roommates do this, but you especially will.\n\n4) You will likely never stop being the villain in her eyes unless she receives counseling. That is just going to be something you have to accept. It  will get easier to handle over time. Do not accept guilt trips or her ignoring your boundaries.\n\n5) This is a game of waiting until you get out. I\u2019m so so sorry you have to go through this. Save up money so you can confidently leave home as soon as you graduate from high school.\n\nTl,dr: you literally cannot do anything to help your mom. It\u2019s impossible. She is sick and will not get better without professional help. What you can do is take care of yourself so that you are well adjusted when you do get out.\n\nSending love.

Example from my own life: Running a dishwasher  that isn\u2019t full instead of waiting until I can tackle ALL of the dishes in my sink. It is much easier to deal with higher order tasks like loading the dishwasher when you were able to use a clean bowl and a clean spoon (instead of a fork, because all of the spoons were dirty). Perfection does not exist, especially with cleaning. See how you can make your space 1% more helpful for you every day and that will compound over time.\n\n2) Mess isn\u2019t moral. You are not a bad person for not cleaning. Do you think you\u2019re better than other people if you take a shower? Of course not. It\u2019s a maintenance task and nothing more. People and houses both get dirty as a result of being alive. All you do when you clean your home is you give it a shower.\n\nBonus tip: I echo others\u2019 sentiment about designating days to certain tasks. Don\u2019t wait until the sink needs to be cleaned for you to clean it. If Mondays are bathroom days, the sink will stay cleaned over time.", "created_utc": "1631051602.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hbzg2w0", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_pjqf30", "parent_id": "t3_pjqf30", "score": "3", "subreddit": "CleaningTips", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qrh5"}, {"author": "coffeeshopfit", "body": "Not a book but [Dreaming Spanish has a bunch of videos about Spanish history](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlpPf-YgbU7EDirU0cmpLnrXEAkvOVZCB) if you\u2019re interested!", "created_utc": "1630979501.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hbvq07k", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_pj5yxj", "parent_id": "t3_pj5yxj", "score": "2", "subreddit": "Spanish", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qtt1"}, {"author": "coffeeshopfit", "body": "I like dogs because the ones I\u2019ve had are really friendly and they tend to put up with just about anything (you want me to wear a costume because you\u2019re dead inside?

Being in therapy it\u2019s likely that you know what these are, but if you don\u2019t, I highly recommend asking your therapist/looking into it on google. This thought distortion is mind reading\u2014 you believe she thinks poorly of you. Do you have actual concrete evidence of this being the case? If not, that\u2019s just your brain being mean to you.\n\nSecond of all, yeah, there are a bunch of tips and tricks we have all tried for organization as people with ADHD. By our very nature, our brains don\u2019t tend to adhere to things for very long (even though structure is V GOOD for our brains bc it\u2019s grounding). I think that you need to give yourself permission to try a bunch of things, even if it didn\u2019t \u201cwork\u201d before.\n\nAt least for me, I used to think that a tip/trick wasn\u2019t worth my time if I couldn\u2019t do it every day. But if I actually sit down and think about it, the only things I actually do every single day are eat, sleep, and get on my phone! I don\u2019t drink coffee every day (something I love doing) and I don\u2019t brush my teeth every day either (much to my dentist\u2019s and my wallet\u2019s chagrin).\n\nWhat I\u2019m TRYING to say is that we can often get frustrated with ourselves for not being \u201cconsistent\u201d rather than giving ourselves the freedom to have ever changing ways of being. Like sure, maybe you tracked your time and thought it was a helpful exercise but you didn\u2019t do it the next day so you decided it \u201cdidn\u2019t work\u201d. That doesn\u2019t mean it wouldn\u2019t be a valuable exercise in the future! Let\u2019s say you want to exercise more. Instead of forcing yourself to run every day or a few times a week, why not say that instead of running, you could dance to 3 songs and still fill the exercise requirement? Or just like,,,,, give yourself a break that day??\n\nIdk, this is just what came into my head. Hopefully it was helpful.\n\nTl,dr: just because something didn\u2019t work before doesn\u2019t mean it couldn\u2019t be a valuable thing in the future. Maybe you should re-evaluate what the criteria for a tip \u201cworking\u201d actually is.\nAlso, idk about your relationship with your therapist, but you\u2019re having some pretty big thought distortions. I think you should talk to her about this\u2014 she is trained to walk you through those distortions. But at the end of the day she is a professional providing a service you are paying for.

Example: Adam has an orange. He is the only one benefiting from it. Adam then shares his orange with Jessica. That means Adam and Jessica both experience benefit from having (or eating) the orange *at the same time*. \"To\" implies transfer of ownership, which isn't what happens when you share. :)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>**My brain is like chocolate mousse:** there is a lot of air in it. It also expires really **quickly** if you do not store it in the right conditions. The ingredients are **100%** natural. And there **are** absolutely no additives.\n\nTo sound more natural, get rid of the \"a\" before \"chocolate mousse\".\n\n\"It also expires really quick\" isn't technically right, which is why I corrected it, but you'll hear native speakers, including myself, say that same phrase. Not a huge deal.\n\nWe (in the United States, at least) don't put spaces in between our words and punctuation unless it's at the end of a sentence; like after a period or after a question mark. Keep the colon and the percent sign following the letter or number before it without adding in an extra space.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>I don't visit many subreddits. When I do, I often **forget** to join it, so it **disappears** from my **brain** soon after.\n\nIt seems like you just had a small typo with \"forget\". No big deal.\n\n\"Disappears\" has two Ps. :)\n\n\"Disappears from my reality\" isn't a natural phrase. The closest thing I could think of to change it to would be what I marked above.

A lot has already been said, so I want to offer a few tips that are hopefully different from other commenters surrounding food.\n\nYou mentioned spending $180 on vegan friendly food. I am making a big assumption here, but I am assuming a good portion of that consists of vegan \u201csubstitutes\u201d for things like meat and cheese. Do not feel pressured to buy those things just because they seem like \u201cvegan food\u201d. \n\nPB & J is most likely vegan (depending on the bread). So is spaghetti. Rice and beans are a staple in a ton of cultures. As someone who has been vegan for nearly a decade, I really recommend eating as un-processed as possible. Incorporate plants wherever you can. That will help you feel your best, and it is also way cheaper than buying the substitutes. (Which are not bad, but new vegans tend to go overboard on them. I happen to enjoy a good beyond burger every couple of months myself!)\n\nLook for recipes where your Omni family members can easily add what they want while keeping your own portion vegan. Having taco night? Great! Keep the cheese, beans, meat, and all the other toppings separate so that you can have a vegan taco. (I like to turn this one into a taco salad for some more greens.) What if you\u2019re having spaghetti night? Cool. Make one big batch of pasta, but let your family pour their meat sauce or cream sauce or cheese on their portion while you stick with a humble marinara. \n\nIt will all get better over time. Don\u2019t get too hard on yourself if things don\u2019t go perfectly (because they won\u2019t). \n\nProud of you friend!

I had to move back in with my hoarder parent due to COVID as well, so I definitely emphasize with you. I don\u2019t follow Dave Ramsey strictly but I hope this advice is still helpful.\n\nMy best advice (other than moving out) is to automate your savings. Take a portion of your paycheck in savings and have it direct deposit into some sort of account that will make you money, whether it be in a High Yield Savings Account (HYSA) or in the market. \n\n1) I have an Ally HYSA, but especially due to covid, it has crazy low returns. This is still a good option though. \n1a) I have been using this app called Digit to automatically save my money for me based on an algorithm. It takes your money, puts it into an account, and keeps it for you. My mom makes half as much as I do and has way more bills and she enjoys the app a lot. It also gives you a bonus every 3 months based on your average balance.\n\n2) Stash Investing has a debit card that allows you to get stock back on top of everyday purchases. If you use that card, even while ordering cockroach spray on Amazon, you\u2019ll get a little bit of Amazon stock back on your purchase. Any other retailer that doesn\u2019t have matching stock, you can pick a set of stocks for it to go to, such as \u201cDelicious Dividends\u201d. These are stocks for companies that give you money for owning their stock. Usually a couple pennies. They also have a mutual fund called \u201cPark My Cash\u201d where money will sit and grow. I recommend having both a savings account and an investment account. Even if it\u2019s just $10 a month.\n\nAnyway\u2014and I\u2019m sure you know this\u2014 that place is not a good living situation. I think you knew that before you posted this, which is perfectly alright. If you choose to stay, make sure that you have a space that\u2019s all your own; whether it be a whole room or a simple table. Keep it clean and don\u2019t let anyone else use it. That will be your one spot of refuge. You can\u2019t control your parents. You can only control what is yours.\nIf you do move out, (which again I think you should), your parents might try and give you things to \u201chelp you out\u201d like furniture. Do. Not. Take. It. (Unless you genuinely want it.) Taking that will reinforce in their brains that they DID actually need to keep that old red couch that\u2019s been sitting in the garage for a year and a half, because it finally became useful.\n\nYou\u2019re not alone.

One of the reasons that language doesn\u2019t stick into our brain is lack of association. Loosely paraphrasing Gabe Wyner: For example, when we see the word dog, we think of a dog. We think of a small furry animal, the feeling of their tongue on our leg, and how gross their poop smells when we have to pick it up. By the same token, we don\u2019t have those same associations for the word perro, which is dog in Spanish. \n\nMedia in Spanish (whether it be video games, YouTubers, movies, music, or TV shows, etc.) help provide that context.

Disney Plus has tons of movies and TV with Spanish audio, although it\u2019s important to note that subtitles usually will not match the audio if it isn\u2019t the original language of the program.

You have to actively get to know them and find things in common. You also have to actively keep up the conversation if there\u2019s a chemistry there. Both of you do. If you\u2019re wanting a number, it probably took a month or so before I found someone.\n\nIt\u2019s okay to have short conversations and never talk to that person again, though; either way you\u2019re still practicing your Spanish. :) I hope this helped!", "created_utc": "1603060848.0", "edited": "False", "id": "g99o02b", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_jck4k2", "parent_id": "t1_g96qkfv", "score": "1", "subreddit": "Spanish", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qtt1"}, {"author": "coffeeshopfit", "body": "Aw that\u2019s so sweet :) I\u2019m glad to hear that.", "created_utc": "1603059680.0", "edited": "False", "id": "g99ly00", "is_submitter": "True", "link_id": "t3_jd54ie", "parent_id": "t1_g96mef7", "score": "1", "subreddit": "Spanish", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qtt1"}, {"author": "coffeeshopfit", "body": "Gracias :) S\u00ed, no quiero decirle a un desconocido \u201ctienes ingl\u00e9s mal\u201d o algo m\u00e1s.\n\nEn mi caso, supongo que puedo entender el espa\u00f1ol a un nivel m\u00e1s alto del que soy capaz de producir.

This is of course going to depend on your level, but, change what language settings you can to Spanish. My Microsoft Teams application for work is in Spanish. I have a separate YouTube channel under my same account that is only for Spanish content. Any hobby that you have that will not affect anyone else by being in another language is a great candidate for being done in Spanish.\n\nWhen you\u2019re able, listen to music in Spanish. Not just stereotypical Spanish-language music, but the genre of music you would normally listen to in English, but in Spanish. (Spotify has TONS of great playlists for this.) TV in Spanish too! The chrome extension \u201cLanguage Learning with Netflix\u201d is a godsend, and the premium version is super affordable as well.\n\nCheck out books in Spanish from the library if they\u2019re available. Due to covid I have only been checking out books for my kindle as opposed to physical books, but that has actually even made things more convenient!\n\nSpeaking with native speakers (I have had great luck with apps called Tandem and Lingbe) is so so so so so important as well because they are able to catch things and explain if something you said makes sense. I love it when my language exchange partner from Peru is like \u201cokay what did you mean by that? that is a super weird way to say what you said\u201d etc.\n\nFinally, my best advice that I can give is to be patient and measure your progress if possible. At the beginning of quarantine, I was hovering somewhere around an A2 and would be like a deer in the headlights any time I heard Spanish spoken to me. I could speak a little, but mostly the phrases \u201cYo s\u00e9 un poquito de espa\u00f1ol\u201d and \u201cyo tom\u00e9 clases de espa\u00f1ol en la escuela secundaria\u201d. (I just graduated college.) With more time on my hands, I decided to get more serious about actually being fluent in the language. I filmed a video talking in Spanish about my day etc probably back in March and I\u2019m so so excited to film another one and see how my accent has/hasn\u2019t changed, if my vocabulary has expanded, etc.\n\nI know this is kind of a word vomit of a post but \nTl;dr: replace daily activities/hobbies in English with those same activities/hobbies in Spanish!

I started off by watching Extra again. I hadn't seen it since my spanish 2 class in high school almost a decade ago.  The best part about that show is that it recaps things for you in English. Also, especially if you watch it on YouTube, often people have included a transcript in the comments. Don't focus on Sam's speaking as much (especially in the early episodes) as he makes frequent errors.  If a word keeps coming up that you don't know, write it down. Then, make a flashcard on Quizlet or an app like Anki. Even if you don't understand every word they are saying, it's pretty easy with that show to get context.\n\nNext, use an app like HelloTalk, Lingbe, or Tandem to practice your spanish with natives. It will be *painful* to speak to natives, especially if they don't know very much English, but you have to actively use vocabulary to make it stick.\n\nI have also watched a show called *Morphle;* It's originally in English but there is a spanish dub on Netflix. Even though it's a children's show, they speak incredibly slow and each episode has multiple stories, so it's less likely to be boring. It's about a little girl named Mila and her friend (pet?) Morphle who can morph into anything Mila asks; be it a monkey or a plane with feet. I really enjoyed it but maybe it's because I'm a child lmao.\n\nI would be remiss if I didn't mention the chrome extension called something like *Language Learning with Netflix.* The extension allows you to have subtitles in two languages, slow down the show, and even blur out your native language's subtitles until you need them. You can also save words/phrases with the pro version and go back to where they were in the show to hear them in context.\n\nI really don't recommend watching spanish dubbed shows with the subtitles on as they often don't match the dub. If you do watch dubs of shows you have already seen, keep the subtitles off.\n\nSomeone recently posted a playlist of music in spanish that they're listening to -- listen to that.\n\nThe SpanishDict app has a spaced-repetition vocabulary quiz that I've been using to learn more vocab. I like it a lot.\n\nFinally, my favorite tip is the Duolingo Spanish Podcast. I would start this when you have a little bit more confidence in the language (It is for intermediate level learners) but it's awesome because it's mostly in Spanish with context in English.\n\nI hope this helps you!

We're in the same boat. Same mental health issues too. The last thing that actually worked for me was waking up in the morning and cleaning for 10 minutes immediately. I would put on a playlist, set a timer for 10 minutes, and then get to work. Sometimes the 10 minutes would drag by. Other times I would continue cleaning after the 10 minutes. Eventually, I'd start setting the timer for 11 minutes, 12 minutes, and so on.\n\nMy landlord came to see my place and that drove me to clean everything. I finally felt like I was free. Then, I fell out of the habit of cleaning regularly. Then the pandemic hit.\n\nMy best advice to you (but really to me) is to take baby steps. Like, stupidly small steps. Steps so small that you could do them under the most tense and restless days. Because of our culture and ADHD, we want things quickly, and unfortunately life change just doesn't happen that way. An example for me right now of a baby step would be to take one bowl off of my bed and put it in the kitchen. I didn't say I would wash the bowl or clean off and make my horrendously cluttered bed. I just said I would make a small vote to get better. \n\nThink about your trajectory. Is it towards a clean space or a cluttered space? Every action you take affects this and can alter your course; one you can reset at any time. I used to be secretly afraid of having a clean space because it felt sterile and void of feeling. Now I know that a clean space allows you to do the things you want to, and instead of adding to your stress, it helps take it away.\n\nI know cleaning is exhausting.

If it's not financially possible right now, a lot of churches have counseling resources you can use. \n\nI'll toss in my two cents about keeping it clean: try to batch tasks when you can't clean as you go. For example, I eat a lot of meals in my room. If left to my own devices, I will accumulate embarrassing amounts of dirty dishes in my room and leave them there for months if not longer (yay). Since completely cleaning my room, I do still have that tendency, but if I leave the previous meals' dishes in my room, I will make sure to clean them all after finishing dinner; because it's stupid to clean just one dish if I have others that need to be done. (I hope that makes sense; I'm not feeling too great atm)\n\nAlso, you're going to have to establish new habits once your room is clean to keep it that way. **Atomic Habits** by James Clear is the *best* book I have ever read about habits. Do yourself a favor and borrow it from the library or pick it up from the bookstore. \n\nCongratulations on all the work you have done. It doesn't matter how slow you need to go as long as you do not stop. :)", "created_utc": "1585279500.0", "edited": "False", "id": "flmbw29", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_fpixkj", "parent_id": "t3_fpixkj", "score": "3", "subreddit": "hoarding", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s9r3"}, {"author": "coffeeshopfit", "body": "Shopper (and former grocery store worker) here, Try to only touch the items you intend to buy.

I have so many tips to add, though the ones listed are great!\n\n1. **Pomodoro method**: traditional is working for 25 minutes and then breaking for 5 minutes, but I find 25 is too short and breaks my flow state. I like to do 45 on 15 off or 50/10. I use [Tomato Timer](https://tomato-timer.com) or [Study Bunny](https://techacute.com/meet-study-bunny-the-cute-app-to-help-you-focus/) to time my \"pomodoros\".\n   1. Find you're still getting distracted during your \"on\" times? Keep a post-it or a sheet of paper next to you to write down any distractions so they get out of your head. I like to call this \"distraction parking\".\n2. **Study with others:** Try and organize times where you can study with other people via Google Duo, Skype, etc. for accountability.\n   1. If you think that will be distracting, **study with me** videos on youtube are great. I like to have them on while I work. There's a channel called \"Man Sitting Next To Me\" with built-in 50/10 pomodoros where this guy just sits there and studies. It sounds weird, but it's super helpful. It's also live 24/7.\n3. **Find the right source of stimulation:** I like having [Lo-Fi Hip Hop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHW1oY26kxQ) on while I study, especially because it doesn't have lyrics. [Coffitivity](https://coffitivity.com/) is another AWESOME choice for those of us that like working in coffee shops. It simulates coffee shop sounds and doesn't have intelligible speech. You can also try googling nature sounds, or a combination of things! I usually have coffitivity and lo-fi hip hop on at the same time at a very low volume. I do make a point to take off my headphones during the \"off\"/break periods so I don't get overstimulated.\n4. **Move around!** Every couple of hours (*at least)* get up for a glass of water/bathroom break/stretch. Don't forget to eat.\n\nI felt like I had more but in true ADHD fashion, I forgot them. Hope these help you! Have a great semester!!\n\nEDIT: 5. **Freedom:** [Freedom](https://freedom.to) is an app that blocks distracting websites/apps across platforms. Have a problem with youtube? Set it up to where you can't access youtube via the app or the website.\n\nI have it set up so that 11:15pm-9:30am when I should be sleeping/doing productive things, I can't get distracted by my phone. I'm also thinking of creating another session so that I have distractions blocked for when I should be doing classwork.\n\nPeople with ADHD are creative, let's see how creative we can really be haha!", "created_utc": "1584117435.0", "edited": "1584117860.0", "id": "fkeojfo", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_fhyotj", "parent_id": "t3_fhyotj", "score": "1", "subreddit": "ADHD", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qnwb"}, {"author": "coffeeshopfit", "body": "Woah!

It's so handy to have a serving of rice or a full bowl of black beans and rice already made for you when you've had a busy week!!\n\nI hope you LOVE it! :) The links I added all have more Instant pot recipes with more resources!
