[{"author": "Espartero1830", "body": "Hi! I am a Biotech student, but I love linguistics, and wanted to get more into it, specifically more academia oriented, not as a job obviously, but more as a serious hobby. I was wondering whether there are densely packed scientific books or courses, similar to a university degree. I know how it sounds, but as an example, The fall and decline of the Roman Empire, by Edward Gibbons is a great way to get into Roman history, from an academia point of view. Another example, J. Sambrook's Molecular Cloning, although not novel style (I highly doubt there are any novel style books for biology), is a perfect way to get into Biotech, because it clearly explains some fundamental concepts while going through some very useful processes in molecular cloning.\n\nSo that was my question, any recommendations on books or courses (maybe edX or Coursera), to get into university level?\n\nThanks", "created_utc": "1667226171.0", "edited": "False", "id": "iui1p66", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_ydv56r", "parent_id": "t3_ydv56r", "score": "1", "subreddit": "linguistics", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhos"}, {"author": "Espartero1830", "body": "I think in a semi informal or informal context, teleport is valid for both, because when you transverse a portal you're technically teleporting matter across space, even if it's not all at the same time.", "created_utc": "1665505064.0", "edited": "False", "id": "irwm9wg", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_y11ecf", "parent_id": "t1_irv4byg", "score": "1", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "Espartero1830", "body": "It's French Dictionary - Offline, by Livio.
