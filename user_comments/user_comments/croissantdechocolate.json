The opposite, actually, since the main problem aren't the letters itself: it's the different locations for all of the special characters that make me go crazy.\n\nI do this because the Brazilian keyboard has what's called \"dead keys\" to make accents. For example, we have a specific key for all of the accents, and they are dead keys. A dead key basically modifies the key pressed just after that.\n\nSo, if I type the \" \\` \" + \" e \" I get \" \u00e8 \". This is super useful if you learn multiple languages. For example, there is no \" \u00f1 \" in Portuguese, but since we do have a key for \" \\~ \", by default : \" \\~ \" + \" n \" = \" \u00f1 \".\n\nI think this is the best way to use it for multiple languages, and if you find a slightly modified setting for your keyboard layout that has dead keys for accents, you get everything without having to get used to some other keyboard (while at the same time being prepared if you ever learn some other third language!)", "created_utc": "1664350302.0", "edited": "False", "id": "iq7jrxn", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_xpqc7z", "parent_id": "t3_xpqc7z", "score": "1", "subreddit": "French", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rd5t"}, {"author": "croissantdechocolate", "body": "Ver minha estante vazia pra mim \u00e9 a melhor parte de ter um Kindle haha", "created_utc": "1664187861.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ipycjsn", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_xo666p", "parent_id": "t1_ipxmsr0", "score": "4", "subreddit": "Livros", "subreddit_id": "t5_2tlr4"}, {"author": "croissantdechocolate", "body": "Omg YES!

Claro, como eu disse, isso depende da pessoa.\n\nSobre sal\u00e1rio baixo: \u00e9 verdade, na Espanha e Portugal voc\u00ea vai ganhar menos, mas isso n\u00e3o significa que n\u00e3o vai ter uma boa condi\u00e7\u00e3o de vida.

Tenho a impress\u00e3o que \u00e9 a marca mais mainstream brasileira nesse momento, uma galera do Cifra Club sempre faz videos sobre os pedais deles. Eles t\u00eam uns pedais que parecem bons, como o Reverb RV-1 (bom bonito e barato), o delay Echoes e a distor\u00e7\u00e3o dupla Myth of Tones.    \n\n\n\\- [Deep Trip](http://deeptripland.com/) tamb\u00e9m \u00e9 muito famosa. O BOG (fuzz) deles \u00e9 [bem conhecido fora do Brasil](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guqCqBAxqwY), e eles tamb\u00e9m tem uma vers\u00e3o do Big Muff que parece ser muito boa. N\u00e3o pesquisei tanto sobre a marca ainda, assim que n\u00e3o sei muito sobre os outros efeitos dela.  \n\n\n\\- [NIG](http://www.nigmusic.com.br) (ou GNI, como \u00e9 conhecida fora do Brasil) tamb\u00e9m faz pedais, entre outras coisas relacionadas a guitarra (como cordas, acho). O Multi fuzz deles \u00e9 bem conhecido e usado pelo Andy Timmons. Tem tamb\u00e9m o Octa fuzz deles que parece ser bom e n\u00e3o \u00e9 caro, voc\u00ea pode ver [esse video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI73q3657zk) do Pedro Bernardi sobre ele e at\u00e9 o Josh da JSH pedals fala rapidamente sobre ele no come\u00e7o do [epis\u00f3dio sobre Octave fuzz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtBIP5X1HgA) do canal youtube dele.  \n\n\nNa pr\u00f3xima vez que eu for pro Brasil, provavelmente vou trazer um NIG Octa fuzz comigo, mas tamb\u00e9m gostaria de saber mais sobre o reverb da Fuhrmann e o [Genesis da King Pedals](https://www.kingpedals.com/genesis-pro) por exemplo, e tamb\u00e9m gostaria de saber sobre os Chorus e Vibe da Fuhrmann e [T.
