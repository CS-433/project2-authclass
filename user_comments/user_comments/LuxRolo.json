What countries are the best for English speakers and which countries have the easiest languages to learn?\n\nA lot of the countries have strong English skills that you can get by with just knowing English, but as above point  it does make you feel very alone. Norwegian is apparently  one of the easiest to learn, it's also a 3in1 as you can understand both Danish and Swedish to a degree.\n\n>4.

I don't go to foreign shops to buy British chocolate or snacks, I eat the Norwegian varieties now.\n\n>5.

Definitely start doing this now and try to avoid asking your parents for help, if you get stuck and need help, call the company. Moving countries definitely makes you grow up quickkklyyy. (Taxes are also so much fun to do in a foreign country too...)\n\n>6. How much should I have saved up (after converting to Euros?) I currently have $15,000 CAD saved. I could probably save up to $30,000 CAD in 2/3 years time with my same living situation.\n\nDepends on your situation, if you're going to university you need; for example 126 357kr ($14.5k USD) for each year in Norwegian university, for a work visa, you could survive with only a few months worth of savings.\n\n7.
