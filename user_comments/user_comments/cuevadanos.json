J\u2019ai vu que les commentaires parlent de la situation du basque au Pays Basque fran\u00e7ais (ou le Nord, comme on dis). Je suis n\u00e9e, je suis grandie et j\u2019habite au Pays Basque espagnol (excusez moi pour mes erreurs en parlant fran\u00e7ais). Comme vous voyez dans les autres commentaires, Biarritz n\u2019est pas repr\u00e9sentatif du Pays Basque en mati\u00e8re de langue; c\u2019est une des villes les plus \u00ab\u00a0\u00e9trang\u00e8res\u00a0\u00bb. Pardon pour la r\u00e9ponse longue mais je veux pratiquer mon fran\u00e7ais!!!\n\n1 \u2013 est-ce que beaucoup de gens parlent vraiment le basque comme le fran\u00e7ais ou l\u2019espagnol? OUI! Il y a environ 400.000 personnes qui ont le basque comme langue maternelle (et j\u2019en suis une!). Le plupart du gens qui parlent le basque chez eux et \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9cole sont parfaitement bilingues. On a l\u2019accent de notre ville ou r\u00e9gion (par exemple, j\u2019ai un accent central). Je parle basque avec ma famille et mes amis et j\u2019ai \u00e9tudi\u00e9 tout en basque; \u00e9videmment, je parle la langue couramment.\n\n2 \u2013 est-ce que vous \u00eates aussi \u00e0 l\u2019aise en basque qu\u2019en anglais ou fran\u00e7ais (ou espagnol)? Non. Je suis plus \u00e0 l\u2019aise en basque. Comme je l\u2019ai dit, le basque est ma langue maternelle. Pour moi, c\u2019est la langue la plus facile pour utiliser. J\u2019ai pass\u00e9 tout ma vie en \u00e9tudiant l\u2019espagnol et l\u2019anglais, et je les peux parler parfaitement et couramment, mais c\u2019est toujours plus facile utiliser la langue basque.\n\n3 \u2013 quand avez vous l\u2019occasion de le parler dans votre vie courante? Tout le temps. Avec toute ma famille je parle en basque. Avec mes amis de l\u2019universit\u00e9, je parle en basque. Quand je suis chez ma ville je parle basque pour acheter des choses aussi. Quand je suis \u00e0 Gasteiz (o\u00f9 j\u2019\u00e9tudie) c\u2019est un peu plus difficile parce qu\u2019il y a moins personnes qui parlent basque.\n\n4 \u2013 mati\u00e8re \u00e9coles bilingues: \u00e7a d\u00e9pend d\u2019o\u00f9 vous \u00eates.

Il y a des \u00e9coles qu\u2019enseignent le basque comme m\u00e9tier seulement (par exemple, trois heures de basque chaque semaine), il y a des \u00e9coles ou tout se fait en basque, et il y a des \u00e9coles o\u00f9 il y a un petit m\u00e9lange (par exemple, maths et sciences en espagnol, et histoire et \u00e9conomie en basque). \u00c0 Navarra et au Pays Basque fran\u00e7ais le basque n\u2019est pas obligatoire, mais il y a des \u00e9coles o\u00f9 les enfants peuvent \u00e9tudier en basque.\n\nUn fait int\u00e9ressant: il y a trois r\u00e9gions (\u00ab\u00a0counties\u00a0\u00bb en anglais, je ne sais pas le mot en fran\u00e7ais) ou le basque est la langue la plus utilis\u00e9e: Lea-Artibai, Urola Kosta et Tolosaldea.

I\u2019m a native speaker of an endangered language myself, so I have a little bit of hands-on experience.\n\nWhen it comes to reviving a language with few speakers, two things are considered essential:\n\u2013 Increasing the amount of speakers of the language\n\u2013 Increasing the number of communicative contexts the language can be used in \n\nMy native language is mainly spoken in two countries. In the sixties, it was banned in one country (and had been for a generation) and it had no official protection at all (no education, administration services\u2026 nothing) in the other one. The number of speakers was low and language use was restricted to the home.\n\nThere are a number of ways in which languages can be revitalised (and as many of them as possible should be attempted):\n\u2013 Introducing the language in education.*\n\u2013 Giving the language official/protected status, so it can be used in administration/government.\n\u2013 Developing a written standard of the language, for those languages that don\u2019t have a lot of written literature/have very different dialects/are restricted to the home (like mine).**\n\u2013 Using the language in news and the media.\n\u2013 Using the language in public signage (you\u2019d be surprised at how important it is!)\n\u2013 and a few more things.\n\n*Education is extremely important, but, for revitalisation to be a success, it needs to be done right. Ideally, all subjects taught at school should be taught through the endangered language, and the working language of school should be the endangered language. The native languages of the students should NOT be treated with disrespect. The curriculum should aim to teach students how to communicate effectively in the language. Education in the endangered language should extend to all levels of education (preschool, compulsory education, and further education). Some countries, despite having taught endangered languages at school for decades, have failed and are failing at this, because they\u2019re not doing it right. We aren\u2019t doing it very well either, to be honest.\n\n**This is what you mentioned in the original post. Irish has had a lot of written literature so this doesn\u2019t really apply, but, for instance, my native language had very little written output. Most people didn\u2019t know how to write in the language. A standardised version was created in the seventies. A lot of new words and grammar structures were created to allow the language to be used in many contexts in which it wasn\u2019t used at the time. Even now, new terms are coined frequently. If people want an endangered language to be used to practise law, for example, and if there isn\u2019t a tradition of practising law through the language, there will be a need to create new terms related to law.", "created_utc": "1664484621.0", "edited": "False", "id": "iqeyp3v", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_xpvu1t", "parent_id": "t3_xpvu1t", "score": "1", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "cuevadanos", "body": "Ez zen merkatal zentru bat, denda askoren elkartea baizik.

My family and I went there and looked at a menu while we were waiting to be seated. \u201cBeans from (fake farm name) in [placeholder]\u201d were featured. It immediately caught my attention. My parents were surprised and told me that the farm was fake and they didn\u2019t know of any beans-producing farms in their hometown. (The number of farms there can be counted with two hands.)

Same thing goes with going to class late.\n\nAt some schools there are official rules about how many days you can miss or how many times you can be late for class. If someone decides to stop going to class, it can be recorded on their academic history.\n\nAt the latest school I went to (and the one I remember the most), there were rules, but they were never enforced. Many people had commutes that were 1 hour or longer each way, and transportation was not always reliable, so they often arrived late (in one notorious case, they arrived at the end of the second period of class because there had been a storm and a tree had fallen to the railway).\n\nBonus anecdote: I had a pretty long and unreliable commute when I started my last year of school and I arrived late every single day in my first week. I changed my commute route and applied for an exemption to \u201carrive on time\u201d rules. I emailed the high school principal. She was accepting of it and I never got into any trouble for arriving late.\n\nAnother bonus anecdote: especially later on in education, it isn\u2019t necessary to provide a doctor\u2019s note or parent-signed note to justify your absence/tardiness. Another tree had fallen to the railway and the train didn\u2019t arrive.

(And... the name of a terrorist organisation.)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLet's begin with the etymologies.\n\nIlargi (moon) = il (actually spelt like \"hil\" but the pronunciation is the same; dead) + argi (light). Something like \"light of the dead\"\n\n\\*Bihotz (heart; this one is controversial): bi (two) + hotz (\"sound\", but incorrect spelling and slightly off pronunciation). Something like \"two sounds in one\"\n\nSuhiltzaile (firefighter): su (fire) + hiltzaile (killer). Literally \"murderer of fight\". Kind of exists in English as well, to be fair.\n\nErditu (to give birth): the word can also be interpreted as \"cutting something in half\". So, for us, giving birth is cutting a person in half.\n\nAmona (grandmother): ama (mother) + ona (good). For us, grandmothers are good mothers. Are normal mothers bad?\n\nAitona (grandfather): aita (father) + ona (good). Same as the previous example.\n\nMaiteminduta (person in love): maite (to love) + minduta (being hurt). To fall in love is to feel hurt by love. A person who is in love is in pain because of their love.\n\nOrtzimuga (horizon): ortzi (sky) + muga (limit). The horizon is the limit of the sky.\n\nAbertzale (patriot): aberri (homeland) + zale (fan, lover of something). Being a patriot is being a fan of the homeland, and our word for \"patriot\" reflects this.\n\nSorgina (witch): unusual interpretation of \"creator\". Before the Christians came to the Basque Country, we had traditional beliefs and rites. Witches were extremely important and, in some Basque families, the idea of \"mother Nature\" being a higher power still exists. (The largest witchhunt actually happened in the Basque Country.) Women were extremely important in the ancient Basque Country as well.\n\nMusutruk (for free, something that costs no money): musu (kiss) + truke (in exchange of). Instead of money, you pay with a kiss. This word is extremely unusual but it exists and I would say that most Basque people are aware of it.\n\nThose are a few that I could find.

I don\u2019t like that point of view at all.\n\n1- languages are a part of history and culture, and, in fact, languages are the basis of some cultures. Not many people would say that English is the most important thing of English culture, but that isn\u2019t the case for some cultural groups, such as mine. I speak a language that nobody knows the origin of; linguists think it\u2019s older than anything else in Europe, and, according to some theories, it could very well be one of the oldest languages in the world. Do you really want the language to die because you think other languages are more \u201cuseful\u201d?\n\n2- the \u201cusefulness\u201d argument is not fully true. Not everyone is born speaking English, for example, and, for them, communicating in it is a struggle. Imagine if every non-native English speaker was forced to use English to communicate in their lives. This would be an unfair burden on them. My grandfather was born in an environment where Spanish was the \u201cuseful\u201d language and he was forced to learn it. He wasn\u2019t allowed to speak his native language in public, so, until he became fluent in Spanish, he couldn\u2019t communicate with anyone in public. Is that as efficient as you say? Imagine language isolate speakers. Learning languages is already hard for them. Are you going to force them to do so? Why not protect all languages, so everyone can communicate?\n\n3- if you still believe that \u201cuseful\u201d languages exist, why don\u2019t you speak Mandarin Chinese, English, Spanish, or Arabic?", "created_utc": "1660042227.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ijkb1ud", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_wjl3p1", "parent_id": "t3_wjl3p1", "score": "5", "subreddit": "todayilearned", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qqjc"}, {"author": "cuevadanos", "body": "Ah yes, Basque, the forgotten little sister of Spanish", "created_utc": "1660039727.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ijk7lgq", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_wjl3p1", "parent_id": "t1_ijjh2np", "score": "0", "subreddit": "todayilearned", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qqjc"}, {"author": "cuevadanos", "body": "Pretty much everything.

It\u2019s one of the most popular music bands here and I think it\u2019s the most popular one abroad. (Last time I checked, the music video for \u201cAldapan Gora\u201d had over 9 million views\u2026 more than 9 times the number of Basque speakers!) I don\u2019t think they make the best music out there, but they\u2019re good, catchy, and their songs represent Basque culture. There are a couple of them that don\u2019t really make much sense to me, but, well. I\u2019m sick of listening to \u201cAldapan Gora\u201d, though. That song has been very overplayed.\n\nIn my opinion, Basque is way stronger than it was before, for many reasons. I was the first generation in my family (I am 16 years old) to be educated in Basque. There are Basque schools in a lot of places now and, thanks to them, people can study in Basque and speak the language to other children. This is essential. At least where I live, there are no legal restrictions when it comes to using Basque, so more and more people use it. People who don\u2019t speak Basque at home still learn it. There is media (TV, radio\u2026) in the Basque language. Back when my parents went to school, they didn\u2019t speak Basque there. Only at home. When my grandparents were children, Basque was banned (at least, where I live). I grew up watching cartoons in Basque and listening to Basque radio on my way to school. That made me feel like I could live life normally as a Basque speaker, if that makes sense. (I still can\u2019t, but it\u2019s easier now.)\n\nOne thing that came to mind as an answer to your last question was how central the language is to our culture. Languages are always important in cultures, but in the Basque Country, there are many people that believe that a person is or becomes Basque when they learn the Basque language. No matter where you were born or how much time you spent here, or how much you like Basque traditions. If you speak Basque, you\u2019re one of us. If you don\u2019t, then you\u2019re not.

I'm not sure why, but there are a lot more private schools than public schools here. As far as I know, there is one (1) public high school in the entire county, and there are around five private high schools. The same thing happens with primary schools. Some private schools are religious, some offer Basque immersion. There is just one town where you can go to high school here and (if you choose to study there instead of going to the capital, which is in another county) the high school you'll go to depends on where you studied primary school. My hometown's students go to a Basque immersion private school, for example. People from my parents' hometown usually go to the public school.\n\nThis having been said, public schools in the Basque Country are often regarded as more rigorous than their private counterparts. There's the stereotype (that is true to some extent) that getting high grades at private schools is easier and that grades are given away. I went to a private Catholic school for high school, and I obviously had to work hard for my grades, but teachers were often generous when it came to grading and rounded up your mark if they saw you had worked hard.\n\nAt the same time, private schools are sometimes better. Not even the best public school beats the Basque immersion private schools when it comes to Basque immersion. I went to one of those as a child and the teachers were fluent in Basque, the students spoke Basque to each other and we often participated in cultural activities such as singing Christmas carols in Basque or singing Santa Ageda carols in traditional Basque clothing. The instruction is focused on the Basque Country as well. One of the first geography tests I ever took was about locating the historical Basque provinces, their capitals, and my own town on a map. I learned about the county I live in. When I switched to a private Catholic (non-Basque immersion) high school, my classmates didn't know what Maule was or that television in Basque existed.\n\nIf you want a religious education for your children, religious schools are the obvious best bet. If you want a sense of community and the opportunity to volunteer and work with charities, La Salle schools are usually your best bet (although I don't like many of the things they advocate for). If you want your children to receive an education in English, French, or German, or if you're a recent immigrant, and you have enough money, international schools are your best bet.\n\nThe same thing applies to universities: public ones are more rigorous, and the only place where you're guaranteed to get a degree in Basque is at the public University of the Basque Country. At the same time, someone might want to get a degree in business, medicine, engineering, or religious studies. Private schools are, in general, better fits for such people.\n\nTL;DR: generally yes, but it depends on your preferences.", "created_utc": "1654561203.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ibfir0x", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_v56dga", "parent_id": "t3_v56dga", "score": "1", "subreddit": "AskEurope", "subreddit_id": "t5_2uayg"}, {"author": "cuevadanos", "body": "I shave sometimes now, especially if I think I'll be wearing shorts and short-sleeved tops anytime soon.

Notorious examples include the subjunctive and the \"ability\" tenses (to express if you're able to do something).

There are a few words in dialects that are not used in standard, and the other way around. There are a lot of synonyms in standard, and there are a few important gaps. For example, standard doesn't have a word for a really common way of cooking that is: taking a thin slice of meat (any meat, but beef, turkey, and chicken work best), dipping it in egg liquid, dipping it again in bread crumbs, and frying it.

This is what most people do.\n\nYou can also apply to get in after finishing a professional course (trade school) if you have a high enough grade. You can also take some university entrance exams to raise your grade.\n\nYou can apply on the basis of having a degree. For example, if you have an undergraduate degree in Economics, you can apply to study another undergraduate degree, like Mathematics.\n\nThere are special entrance exams for people over 25 and 45 years old. I don't know what they test.\n\nIf you have relevant work experience, and you are over 40 years old, you can also apply on that basis.\n\nThere are saved spots for each of the categories above.

You should check out DAZN Espa\u00f1a on YouTube. DAZN is a sports channel that broadcasts several different sports. Personally, I only watch for Formula 1, but just searching for \"dazn espa\u00f1a\" on YouTube, several football videos popped up.\n\n\"El D\u00eda Despu\u00e9s\" by Movistar Espa\u00f1a can also be good. As far as I know, though, it's very Spain-oriented, so if you don't watch Spanish sports, you might feel a bit lost. These are summaries of what happened after football matches (the title means \"the day after\") and my brother says that they're amazing.\n\nLooking at YouTube channels from Spanish teams can also be a good idea. Some big teams make recaps/summaries of important matches, such as competition finals. Real Sociedad de F\u00fatbol does recaps a lot. \n\nEl Chiringuito de Jugones is a football-oriented talk show. You will not hear anything about actual football there, but from what I've heard, it's extremely funny and there are a lot of memes made out of it. \n\nIf you fancy car racing, Efeuno is an amazing place to start. The guy (V\u00edctor Abad) often does recaps, analysis, throwback videos... of Formula One. There are funny videos, videos explaining historical events, videos about the worst teams in Formula One, meme recreations... I love the channel.\n\nYou can find all of this on YouTube. All of this is European Spanish oriented. I've only watched DAZN and Efeuno, and the commentators from DAZN speak fast, but Efeuno speaks clearly. (I might be a little biased because I've been learning Spanish for almost a decade now). I hope this helps!

Political parties make a list of candidates in every district, and voters vote on those lists. A candidate can only be on one list. Therefore, you can only actually vote for a candidate if you happen to live in the district where the candidate has registered.

Eventually my parents took me to a big teaching hospital. It was quite far away from my home but my dad was convinced I didn't have autism. At this point my mom had quit working because the people at the autistic org had told her I'd be disabled my whole life.\n\nDoctors at the teaching hospital got an MRI scan.\n\nAnyways, I don't have autism but a part of my brain is too big, another one is actively shrinking and my brain cells are not where they should be (they form clumps and there are parts of my brain with no cells).

Try to check the gender of nouns and adjectives, most dictionaries ([rae.es](https://rae.es) for example) will tell you the gender. When using a noun + adjective, BOTH MUST have the same gender.  \n\u2013 Tilde mistakes. You include the Tilde where it shouldn't go, and the opposite. Again, your eat bet is checking with a dictionary. There is another method but it's more time consuming and requires deep knowledge of the language.  \n\u2013 you included some words that don't fit in the context. Again, dictionary. Encantador \u2013 charming, suena \u2013 it sounds, perverso \u2013 perverted, presencia \u2013 presence.

She always reads the news and watches television in Spanish, but she never spoke it to me. Maybe why I'm so good at understanding but my speaking skills are in shambles.\n\nI started learning Spanish in my hometown school at age 7. We just watched videos of the numbers and learned to write. Those are my only memories. \n\nThen I transferred to a new school for sixth grade, one with a lot of Spanish speaking kids of immigrants. The now mandatory Spanish classes were a trainwreck. Stuff for natives. I struggled. I remember the first day of Spanish class, watching the girl next to me give a speech in Spanish. I was mesmerized. I couldn't do that. I learned to write a variety of texts, and got introduced to a bit of literature. We learned (I learned, my classmates reviewed) verb conjugations.\n\nThen I got a new teacher who only taught us grammatical analysis and literature. Now, if you want to analyze a language, you have to know it in depth. Another trainwreck.\n\nIn 2019 I spent a week in Madrid but my mom did all of the talking. That same year (tenth grade) I managed to give a speech in Spanish without stopping. Yay!\n\nNow I'm at a new school and the classes are even harder. We've learned complex grammar concepts, a lot of literature, and the teacher uses a lot of advanced and slang words. Right now around half the class are native speakers and the other half of us have learned it, so I'm not the only one, but we still take the same class and sit the same exams.", "created_utc": "1610985560.0", "edited": "False", "id": "gjq9xht", "is_submitter": "True", "link_id": "t3_kzf2cq", "parent_id": "t1_gjq972n", "score": "2", "subreddit": "GoForGold", "subreddit_id": "t5_2y633"}, {"author": "cuevadanos", "body": "I think it's better on here because it's quite lengthy", "created_utc": "1610985204.0", "edited": "False", "id": "gjq98ub", "is_submitter": "True", "link_id": "t3_kzf2cq", "parent_id": "t1_gjq972n", "score": "2", "subreddit": "GoForGold", "subreddit_id": "t5_2y633"}, {"author": "cuevadanos", "body": "Oh well, not good.
