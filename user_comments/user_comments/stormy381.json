My favorite fanfic in general explores what I see as the internal cores to Ed and Stede\u2019s characterizations. So long as it feels in-character I\u2019m open to a wide spectrum of \u201chow experienced Stede is\u201d (and how experienced Ed is, actually, since I\u2019ve seen that addressed in different ways). I think that the hardest to pull of is the \u201cutterly clueless/never heard of sex\u201d version of Stede since it\u2019s pretty unlikely, but again if it feels natural and true to character I don\u2019t mind it. \n\nThat\u2019s the first kind of fanfic I like, and my preference like I said. The second I would describe as \u201cpuppeteering the characters for a specific fantasy\u201d. It\u2019s not super in-character but the idea is more so a vehicle to setup a specific kink or fantasy scenario. In that case I\u2019m a lot more forgiving of \u201csuper-innocent blushing virgin stede\u201d, since the point is to get your rocks off more than to read affecting prose lol. And if it\u2019s one of my kinks, I can enjoy it without being super critical of whatever dynamics are at play but those fics are more fun and less interesting to me overall. \n\nI will say that I\u2019ve certainly encountered some fics where it felt obvious to me that the author had either never been in or known a queer relationship or never had or seen real gay sex or intimacy. That always pulls me out of the fic. Sometimes it is like the writer pulls a bunch of tropes out from fanfic or other media and it really feels like a stereotype or fantasy version of queerness. \n\nSo I guess for me it\u2019s less what people do and more how it\u2019s portrayed. Does it feel genuine, and true to the characters? Or forced and like any characters could be playing these roles, and it just happens to be Ed and Stede?\n\nLong winded response. To touch back to your original question about specifically Stede\u2019s newness to being gay, my fave fic author (smallestchurch) really exemplifies the style I described first.

I think the found family thing is pretty apparent \u2014 most recently when Guillermo pleaded with Nadja to spare his blood family partly because she was his family too. \n\nAll the various relationship dynamics between the vampires feel deeper than just roommates. Heck, Lazlo did so much for Colin completely selflessly because he knew he\u2019d die, and then literally became his new incarnation\u2019s father. \n\nTrying to think about earlier seasons. I think a lot of the show\u2019s emotional undercurrent is how genuinely awful it is to be immortal sometimes. How isolating and lonely it is. This largely expressed by Nandor but I think Lazlo also often expresses a sort of veiled longing for what he lost, tho under a deep layer of cynicism. For example, him growing apples just to throw them on the ground because he used to love eating them as a child. \n\nI haven\u2019t seen the original movie the show was based on in years, but I think it had a lot of this kind of humor-mixed-with-emotion. There\u2019s the scene when taika vampire is waking the other at his computer and the computer screen shows a video of a sunrise. He fell asleep watching videos of sunrises. \n\nLike, all the vampires in the house are total buffoons. They think they\u2019re awesome and cruel and assholes, but especially through the lens of Guillermo we can see what they really are: humans emotionally frozen in time, living far longer than ever should be a thing, distracting themselves from their suffering by constantly chasing new highs etc. \n\nI mean, I don\u2019t think this is the main *text* of the show, but I do think it\u2019s the emotional through line that keeps the show from being pure nastiness.

When we are portrayed, it's either a mess of stereotypes/trauma or it's fluffffy as fuck -- meaning the relationship dynamics are very healthy, balanced, and uncontroversial. Oftentimes, especially for men in relationships, that also includes utterly desexualizing them.\n\nSecondly monster/human dynamics are wildly popular. See: all vampire media, Shape of Water, etc). The thrill of those dynamics is that it's extremely dangerous, perhaps coercive, perhaps manipulative etc. A lot of people get a thrill and enjoy the *fictional\\** outlet of getting to read about a human being the object of desire by a monster. That, and the idea of being ravished/taken/dominated by that monster, as well as the flip side of being surprised by the romance or gentleness that the human \"brings out in\" the monster. (Hell, throw Beauty and the Beast in there) Not to mention Guillermo is plus size man of color, a group that is hardly ever portrayed as attractive or a love interest. \n\nMonster/human dynamics and queerness? I mean, I think people have probably written dissertations about why queer people might be drawn to these narratives. I also think there's probably more than a little historical context to how vampires/other monsters are queer-coded and allowed for an outlet for queer people before it was 'acceptable'.\n\nTo put it all together, Nandor and Guillermo have: A human/monster dynamic, as well as other power dynamics at play. It's not \"healthy\" or \"balanced\" or \"safe\", which is the appeal! They're both super attractive and the actors have great chemistry. The other comments go into more of the in-text reasons they might be attracted. So it's basically 90% canon at this point, given the direction the writers seem to be pushing.

Even the horse's \"kind eyes\", heh). It's an accusation tailor-made to hurt him the deepest, whether Badminton knows it or not.   \n\n\n> The admiral\u2019s point is further proven right when he missteps and falls, shooting himself in the face right in front of Stede, almost to demonstrate that everything Stede barely even touches in his attempts to be someone he isn\u2019t gets obliterated\n\nAh this is such a good point. Like let's put some real emphasis on this, shall we? It echoing Badminton 1's death (which is the first time Stede has to really confront his decision to leave his family), further propells him to freak out and run home.  \n\n\n>So when Chauncey tells Stede he defiles beautiful things, this means whatever Chauncey mentions is something he considers beautiful by patriarchal standards too. His brother Nigel makes a lot of sense. A brother you love is a beautiful thing to you, but Nigel was more than just Chauncey\u2019s twin. Nigel was an example of a Real Man.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Of course Chauncey would respect that fame, in a way. It\u2019s still a patriarchal masculine ideal. All that time, however, Stede\u2019s mental image of Ed is when he is finally beardless and open and vulnerable at the foot of their bunk bed. The point of view of looking down on Edward in such a state is intimate in a way Chauncey could never even imagine, and it\u2019s why, for Stede, Ed hurts the most. \n\n  \n(No comments here, I just think they're great points!)  \n\n\n>AND YET!!!! Yet!!!!!!! In spite of it all, in spite of the tail of trouble that follows Stede\u2026 Stede brings light wherever he goes.\n\nYes, Stede ends up being an incredibly positive force for the people around him!  \nIronically, as you say, once Stede accepts himself and leaves Mary on good terms, he's actually allowed for his family to flourish. She steps into her own self in a much more empowered way, and has the ability to become a much better mother by virtue of Stede freeing the family of soceital pressures. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Stede almost successfully pulls off that type of masculinity when he goes back to Barbados, both when he impresses his neighbors with his tales of blood and when he attacks Doug at Mary\u2019s exhibit. For Stede, though, the anger and resentment within him don\u2019t seem to ease through these demonstrations of machismo, mostly because that\u2019s not who Stede is.\n\nYes, I noticed this too. Like Stede had a taste of 'success' but by the end of episode 10 realizes that it's actually not what he wants. What he wants is Ed, and what Ed represents: Both of them freeing themselves from expectations/patriarchy etc. \n\nLove the analysis!!
