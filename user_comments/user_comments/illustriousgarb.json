You are really wise to be planning ahead like this, so kudos to you for that. I'm not an expert in any of these fields, but I think both culinary school and carpentry are good options. And you certainly don't have to discard your writing or voice work. In fact, I'd encourage you to keep both of those in your back pocket - you never know how you can put those skills to use in the future.\n\nI don't think culinary school is a waste of time. At the very \"worst,\" it is a good way to network. And if you are not a self-starter, it's probably a more effective way to get into the field. You might not have to work nights if you're able to get in somewhere prestigious, but I suspect that most entry level jobs are going to be nights and weekends. There's also the option of working in an already established food cart - these are gaining a lot of popularity in urban areas, and they tend to be a \"lunch time\" thing, at least in my city. Maybe culinary school will clue you in to other types of jobs you can get within the culinary industry that don't require nights. Regardless, if this is where your passion lies, my gut is to tell you to go the food & cookery route.\n\nI also think carpentry is a great idea. The trades are one of the areas that seem to be hurting for good employees, so this is a good route, too. I think you should definitely try to get some experience before committing to that path, though. I don't know where you are in Japan, but perhaps your local community center has some classes, or could hook you up with a carpenter in the area?\n\nBoth options are good, and I wish you luck in deciding which route to take.", "created_utc": "1594314019.0", "edited": "False", "id": "fxfu0ze", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_ho2gzc", "parent_id": "t3_ho2gzc", "score": "1", "subreddit": "findapath", "subreddit_id": "t5_2wqq6"}, {"author": "illustriousgarb", "body": "Thank you!!", "created_utc": "1594251596.0", "edited": "False", "id": "fxd9vpv", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_hnqq1h", "parent_id": "t1_fxd36p6", "score": "1", "subreddit": "TheLastAirbender", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rybx"}, {"author": "illustriousgarb", "body": "Iroh is a gift", "created_utc": "1594246860.0", "edited": "False", "id": "fxd0xcm", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_hnqq1h", "parent_id": "t3_hnqq1h", "score": "2", "subreddit": "TheLastAirbender", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rybx"}, {"author": "illustriousgarb", "body": "Air.

They'd complain about how loud the children were, as if that was something unique to black children. The students got an education, sure.

But life didn't work out that way, and I sometimes think it's because of my crappy choices. Im working towards starting my own business now, and  having that goal has helped me immensely. Here my thoughts:\n\nIf your dream is still to travel and start your own business, then you can still achieve these things. Yes, they might have to be put on hold for a while so you can properly care for your son, but you've got a lot of life ahead of you yet.\n\nI think your first step shoul be to determine what you'd want to do if you started your own business. Identify that goal and then start taking baby steps towards it. It's not going to happen overnight, and it might even be something that takes years to build. That's okay. Having a goal that you can take baby steps towards will help you reestablish a feeling of purpose besides parenthood (which is a great purpose, but a lonely and sometimes unfulfilling one). It can sometimes help to look at our jobs as means to an end, rather than making it part of our identities. This job can be what you need to pay the bills while you slowly save up some money to travel, too. \n\nIt's not easy to reframe our thinking like this, especially when we feel like we sold ourselves short.

Other women in this sub can't have potatoes at all, while others can handle small portions of rice. You'll find what works for you, and although it sucks to have to pass on that piece of pie or that delicious Starbucks drink, it's temporary.
