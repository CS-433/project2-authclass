Get rid of that straw looking stuff hanging at the window above the bed too.  Paint the room accordingly. I would spray paint the metal armoire too. Put the bed and armoire back in the room.  Consider arranging your bed like a daybed with pillows for seating. Without a floor plan or the dimensions, I can't suggest a layout though.\n4.

Many researchers prove that language-minority children are willing to achieve proficiency in the mainstream language in order to be accepted in the new society and not to be different in any way. Consequently, when they face a choice of dominant language versus heritage language, they tend to favour the mainstream language. \n\n> In addition, children are very selective in terms of the language for communication. With monolingual relatives they tend to use their heritage language, while with bilinguals they may code-switch; on the other hand, with representatives of a dominant culture they use the mainstream language, so their language is very context dependent. First generation immigrant children are likely to use their first language more with their grandparents and parents (the possibility of code switching is still high), while they choose the mainstream language in communication with siblings or peers. Kouritzin (2006) notes that \u201cidentity and language \u201cdecisions\u201d made by children in the face of assimilation-oriented dominant culture, are decisions later regretted\u201d.\n\n> The research findings indicate that another potential reason for language shift may be attributed to teachers who do not have a special training in second language acquisition; as a result, they express negative attitudes towards minority language maintenance and think it is the prerogative of immigrant parents only. In addition, public school teachers may encourage parents to use English only at home in order to \u201chelp\u201d their children with second language acquisition. This practice leads not only to HL loss but also causes deterioration of family ties when parents are not able to communicate effectively with their children in a second language.\n\n> Anti-immigrant ideology and hostile attitudes towards some ethnic groups in a host country may provoke the feeling of shame and alienation as well as marginalization of heritage languages\u2026\n\n[Source](https://www.umanitoba.ca/faculties/education/media/2014-Kharchenko-Nataliya.pdf)", "created_utc": "1637882061.0", "edited": "1637916621.0", "id": "hm3ai0l", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_qxxu0w", "parent_id": "t1_hm26uxn", "score": "3", "subreddit": "AmItheAsshole", "subreddit_id": "t5_2xhvq"}, {"author": "BlackStarBlues", "body": ">I am a full time student & he does not have a job...
