Skr\u00fdva sa pod stolom.\" \"Under what is he hiding? He is hiding under the table.\"\n\nHow to know what case it is?\n\nFirst, the **suffix**. St\u00f4l is masculine, singular, paradigm dub. In this paradigm, if the word has no suffix, it's either Nominative or Accusative. Nominative never has a preposition, so \"pod st\u00f4l\" can only be Accusative. \n\nStolom has the suffix -om, so in this paradigm it means Instrumental (Hint: all masculine singular nouns ending with -om are in Instrumental case).\n\nEvery case is an answer to a different question and pairs with different verbs. For example, the **Accusative case** (pod st\u00f4l) pairs with skry\u0165 sa (to hide), spadn\u00fa\u0165 (to fall), \u013eahn\u00fa\u0165 si (to lay down) and others + pod. They are pointing out the direction of the action: He is hiding himself under the table. (Skryl sa pod st\u00f4l.) The paper has fallen under the table. (Papier spadol pod st\u00f4l.) I have to lay down under the table. (Mus\u00edm si \u013eahn\u00fa\u0165 pod st\u00f4l.)\n\nThe **Instrumental case** pairs with verbs like skr\u00fdva\u0165 sa (to be hiding), by\u0165 spadnut\u00fd (to be fallen), le\u017ea\u0165 (to be lying down) and others. They are pointing out about the table, the place where the action is happening: He is hiding under the table. (Skr\u00fdva sa pod stolom.) The paper is fallen down under the table. (Papier je spadnut\u00fd pod stolom.) Le\u017e\u00ed pod stolom. (He is lying down under the table.)\n\nWhen you pair those verbs with different prepositions, you can also get different cases: skry\u0165 sa pod = Accusative, skry\u0165 sa nad = Accusative, skry\u0165 sa s = Instrumental, skry\u0165 sa pred = Instrumental, skry\u0165 sa do = Genitive etc.", "created_utc": "1665013094.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ir7ub07", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_xwo76s", "parent_id": "t3_xwo76s", "score": "10", "subreddit": "Slovakia", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qyjb"}, {"author": "DeepSkyAbyss", "body": "Slovinsk\u00fd for Slovenian (like in \"Slovenian president\", slovinsk\u00fd prezident), slovensk\u00fd for Slovakian (like in \"Slovakian president\", slovensk\u00fd prezident), slovansk\u00fd for Slavic (like in \"Slavic nation\", slovansk\u00fd n\u00e1rod).", "created_utc": "1665003884.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ir79b09", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_xvb361", "parent_id": "t1_ir39j7q", "score": "4", "subreddit": "2visegrad4you", "subreddit_id": "t5_427he1"}, {"author": "DeepSkyAbyss", "body": "The general elections in **1998**.

The traditional kroj goes hand in hand with traditional folklore songs, dances and other performances. Now it is worn at traditional weddings, at the popular folklore festivals, fairs, traditional events like putting up the maypoles, St. Nicolas day (6 Dec), performances of folklore ensambles at different cultural events, before Christmas, etc. \n\nThere was also a TV show, a competition of folklore ensembles and it was quite popular. There is a Slovak Day of Kroj in september with a cultural program, some of our politicians like to show up wearing kroj at some folklore events, mostly to impress their voters (a [photogallery](https://www1.pluska.sk/gal/spravy/z-domova/den-kroja-podani-politikov-sexi-sakova-kristufkova-pellegrini-sukni-tancujuci-kollar/2) of politicians wearing kroj at this year's Day of Kroj).", "created_utc": "1664366583.0", "edited": "False", "id": "iq849lp", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_xpv757", "parent_id": "t3_xpv757", "score": "2", "subreddit": "AskEurope", "subreddit_id": "t5_2uayg"}, {"author": "DeepSkyAbyss", "body": "\"Arrival\" has a similar feel to it, even if it's completely different.

Moja dc\u00e9ra je hladn\u00e1. Moje deti s\u00fa hladn\u00e9.\n\nIn Slovak we have a **\"rule about rhythmic shortening\"**. We have short vowels (a, \u00e4, e, i, o, u, y) and long vowels (\u00e1, \u00e9, \u00ed, \u00f3, \u00fa, \u00fd) - they are pronounced double the length of the short ones. If short is a, the long one is like aa. Similar to Finnish.\n\nThe rule says that if there is a long syllable in a word, the next syllable must be short (contain only short vowel). As a result, you put short vowels where long should be. \n\nFor example, the masculine adjective end with -\u00fd. But the word m\u00fadry (wise) already contains a long syllable, the first one (**m\u00fad**ry), so instead of -\u00fd the ending will be short -y, or m\u00fadry instead of m\u00fadr\u00fd. Same in words like hl\u00fapy (stupid), v\u00e1\u017eny (serious) etc. Same applies to feminine adjectives: m\u00fadra instead of m\u00fadr\u00e1, hl\u00fapa instead of hl\u00fap\u00e1; and neuter: hl\u00fape instead of hl\u00fap\u00e9.\n\nDiphthongs (ia, ie, iu, \u00f4 = uo) count as a long vowel too, so instead of mlie\u010dn\u00fd (milky) the correct form is mlie\u010dny, instead of \u010diern\u00fd (black), the word is \u010dierny. As always, there are exceptions to this rule.\n\nCzech language doesn't have this rule and there are lot of long syllables and words like m\u00e1v\u00e1n\u00ed (waving) with three long syllables, while in Slovak the word is m\u00e1vanie (long-short-long).", "created_utc": "1661176436.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ilbl30p", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_wusdf0", "parent_id": "t3_wusdf0", "score": "7", "subreddit": "AskEurope", "subreddit_id": "t5_2uayg"}, {"author": "DeepSkyAbyss", "body": "Office of Public Health of the Slovak Republic, July 2021:\n\n>In recent years, the Slovak Republic has been among the member states of the European Union with the lowest annual incidence of HIV infection.

The author was not Slavic.\n\nSpeaking about Slovak (and Czech), we actually do consider the palatalised consonants as separate sounds which have a distinctive function.\n\nThere were three palatalisations in Proto-Slavic. In the first palatalisation (from Indo-European to Proto-Slavic), for example, three new consonants were created: **\u010d** (from k), **\u017e** (from g), **\u0161** (from ch). Examples: kih > \u010di, giw > \u017eiv. After the creation of these new consonants, the vocal e changed to **a** (ger > \u017ear, ker > \u010dar).

There are mentions of Central Europe there, considering Slovakia, Czechia and a few other countries in the region as central european. It was a communist magazine. So the Soviets were clearly considering this region as Central Europe too.\n\nP\u00e9ter Han\u00e1k in a book of Jen\u00f6 Sz\u0171cs talks about three historical regions of Europe - Western, Central and Eastern and points out how CE adopted philosophical, religious, cultural and other elements of both WE and EE and acquired its own special characteristic, which make it also able to lean more towards the West or the East when it needs or where a stronger partner pulls it by force (like the USSR). The region has also western religion and was the border of the western culture. The author also points out that CE, specifically of the A-H monarchy, was in between the parliament democracy of the west and the autocracy of the east.\n\nEven in my elementary school textbooks in the 90's-2000's, CE was a separate region - Slovakia, Czechia, Hungary, Austria, Germany, Poland, Switzerland, and my parents learned it too, in the times of the strictest communist regime. \n\nIf someone thinks that Central Europe doesn't exist, it's because they simply don't understand (and I respect it) the thousand years old cultural, political and other ties, which are pretty strong in between those few countries, our cultures are very similar. We consider this Central Europe, because we feel all of that in our everyday life and the other European regions literally feel different from us. Slovakia has more in common with Germany than with Russia, except some Slavic related things like mythology and language. \n\nForeigners can call us as they wish, I am fine with that, but we know where our place is by living it. Only foreigners think that we try to distance ourselves from the \"poor countries\", because it is not about being poor, but being different (we have been poor too). It's like saying we are Western Europe - we are not and we can feel it. We are also not the Northern or Southern Europe, almost nothing in common here.

Kind of like a jam (time) on a piece of bread (space). When you bend the bread, you bend both layers.\n\nGravity warps the spacetime, it stretches it and contracts it. The smaller the gravity, the flatter the spacetime, and the bigger the gravity, the more warped is the spacetime. Like an elastic sheet being stretched.\r\n\nAn apple is falling towards the Earth not because the gravity is pulling it, but because the spacetime around the Earth is warped and the apple is being pushed \u201edown the slope\u201c by the warped spacetime towards the centre of Earth. As it falls down the slope, it accelerates and therefore it moves faster near the Earth surface than when it was far away from the surface.\r\n\nEXAMPLE WITH A CLOCK\r\n\nNow look at [this picture](https://www.scienceabc.com/wp-content/uploads/ext-www.scienceabc.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Time-Dilation-Light-bouncing-on-mirror..gif-.gif). It\u2019s a simple watch, the photon is bouncing between two mirrors and every bounce takes one second. When you let the clock fall towards the Earth, you as an observer will see [this picture](https://www.scienceabc.com/wp-content/uploads/ext-www.scienceabc.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Time-Dilation-Light-bouncing-on-running-mirror.gif-.gif). \r\n\nBefore, when the clock wasn\u2019t moving, you saw the photon move in a short straight line. When it is falling down, it looks to you as if the photon was moving in diagonals, it looks to you as if the distance between two bounces became larger, as if the space was stretched. \r  \nAnd because the photon has to travel a longer route, it also takes him more time to do it. The one second between two bounces is now stretched to more than one second. \r\n\nThe more it falls, the faster it moves, the bigger is the route the photon has to take and the more time it takes to tick one second. The the time stretches and slows down.\r\n\nSome professor also gave another explanation \u2013 everything moves in all four spacetime dimentions. When you see a motionless object, i tis moving only in the time dimention. When it starts moving in space, some of his moving in time will be transformed to moving in space, so his time will slow down. If it uses it all for moving in space (= the lightspeed), there will be nothing left for moving in time, so its time will freeze.\n\nAGING DIFFERENTLY\r\n\nYou asked how can stretched time cause two people to age differently.\r  \nFirst of all, there is no universal time, every point in space has its own time, because the gravity is not the same everywhere. Your toes are closer to Earth, so their time is a little bit slower than the time of your head \u2013 so your head is a little older than your feet. People who live on ground floor are a little younger than the ones living on higher floors. But the difference is too small to be percepted by us, only by machines. The closer to the centre of gravity you are, the slower you age.\r\n\nWhen Coop and the others go to Miller\u2018s planet, they are in very warped spacetime, very low in the gravity\u2019s slope. Romilly is far from it, so his spacetime is much flatter. If he could look down on the planet, he would see them moving very, very slowly, almost like not moving at all. From their point of view, everything is normal, because they are part of that warped spacetime. Even if Murph could see them, she would see them moving painfully slowly. Hours and hours would past for her and they would still be doing that one step.\r\n\nThey age differently because they experience a different time. Murph lives through years, while they only live through hours. Every atom of every cell in their body is part of that warped spacetime and lives through only a short time, so they only age as much time as they experience. She would see them move painfully slowly, they would see her move extremely fast, like fast forward.\r\n\nThere is no universal time, so your aging depends fully on the place in the universe you live in. At some places you would age like crazy, at others very slowly, but it could be only noticed from outside, from the point of view of another observer in a different place. You would notice nothing strange, you would perceive your aging at a normal pace and it would be a normal pace \u2013 it would appear different only when comparing to aging in other part of universe. We are already living like that and we consider it as normal time, normal aging.\r\n\nI strongly recommend to watch [this 11 minute video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qQheJn-FHc), it\u2019s the best explanation of time dilation I have ever seen, very easy to understand.", "created_utc": "1656688666.0", "edited": "False", "id": "iegm8ir", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_vog9er", "parent_id": "t3_vog9er", "score": "1", "subreddit": "interstellar", "subreddit_id": "t5_2w1k9"}, {"author": "DeepSkyAbyss", "body": ">It is said that back during the interwar period Czechoslovakia was the most democratic one\n\nYes, the First Republic of Czechoslovakia (1918-1938) was one of the most democratic and one of the 15 most developed economies in the world.

For centuries, the typical Slovaks were usually poor agrarian people living in small villages and hating their rich masters. I imagine that that led to a feeling of life being unfair, having an inferiority complex, envy the rich and anyone who was living better, and also having a feeling that being rich and successful is wrong.\n\nLater, in the 19th century, having their Slovak identity supressed by the Hungarians probably led to nationalism and a need to protect the Slovak identity and culture. I think that lot of Slovaks still feel like their Slovak identity is in danger and can be taken away from them and they are excessively nationalist and afraid of everything foreign and alien.\n\nFamily has always been important, often multiple generations used to live together and help each other. The society of small villages was conservative and religious, very traditional, things were always being done in certain way and it was expected to continue doing all the same way. Doing something differently or being different was not really accepted and lot of Slovaks still don't accept differences. Maybe this is also a reason why some older Slovaks praise the socialist era, because they were all more equal then (= equally poor).\n\nThere are myths about Slovaks being a \"peaceful nation\" (holubi\u010d\u00ed n\u00e1rod), which is just not true. We also often say that we are very hospitable, and according to the sociologist Michal Va\u0161e\u010dka we really are very generous and helpful, but only with people we accept among us.\n\nWe are also hierarchical and we overuse the college titles (Ing., Mgr., PhD. etc) and authority based on titles. Lot of Slovaks, especially in certain regions, prefer a strong leader, even autocrat, and they look up to him. There was lot of stealing during the communism (\"if you don't steal from others, you are stealing from your family\").\n\nLot of those characteristics are being passed from generation to generation and we have been a modern nation only for a short time, so those old thinking patterns are still present here. The inferiority complex, conservativeness, nationalism and xenophobia, bad relationship with money, valueing more the hard manual work compared to the intellectual or artistic work.

Slovak language is part of the *slavic dialect continuum*: if you were traveling from west of Czech Republic to east of Russia, you would notice only small progressive changes in the local languages/dialects, changes that accumulate with distance, but no real borders between languages.\n\nThat's why the east Czech (Moravian) dialects are very similar to the west Slovak ones, the east Slovak dialects are very similar to the west ones of Ukraine etc.\n\nTo establish a single common language for the whole Slovakia, the standard language, some wise men in the past (namely \u013dudov\u00edt \u0160t\u00far in 1843) had to choose one or more dialects, codify them, write down the official grammar rules and teach it to everyone in the country as the official Slovak language.\n\nSlovak language is based mostly on the dialects of central Slovakia and on some of the western Slovakia. The other Slovak dialects are not as different as other languages are (Czech, Polish, Ukrainian) from the standard Slovak language. There is also nothing making them a \"language\".\n\nI made a simplified [picture here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Lsi4hfKjWehIbzfSVyS5gSqH7MiNzpcl/view?usp=sharing), you can see that the differences in Czech and Slovak dialects are like a color spectrum, no real borders, but seemless changes.

It's the most accepted theory about the start of the universe, according to the data we have now. Big Bang was the initial point of space and also of time, it means that before the Big Bang there was no time. You can't measure time when there is no time. The only time that has existed is the one that started in Big Bang, so the age of the universe is 13.8 billion years. It can expand forever or it can turn back and crash, we don't know this either.\n\nThe Big Bang also created the space, so there was no space before. We only know the size of the observable universe, but there is more of it. As far as I know, we don't know for sure what is the shape of the universe, so we don't know if it's infinite. Could be flat and infinite, could be a sphere and finite, but also kind of infinite. There is no agreement among the scientists.\n\nSo even if we do know it's current age and observable size, we don't know how long it will last in the future and we don't know it's size beyond the observable part.

There are two witnesses, one for the bride and one for the groom, and they are needed mostly only to sign the papers. It's a honor to be a witness though.\n\nIf the bride and groom prefer more traditional wedding (more common in villages), there are a few traditional customs that are done in a specific order.

The bride and the groom have to sweep all the pieces, while some of the guests will try to prevent them from doing so.\n\n\\- At midnight, the most important of the traditions happens, the bride can change to a traditional folk dress and have her veil (in the past it was a symbol of virginity) taken away and it will be replaced by a bonnet for a married woman. It's an old Slavic tradition, married women had to wear the bonnet for the rest of their lifes. At the weddings, there are usually members of some folk ensamble taking care of this, also singing and dancing.

After a few hours, she receives the last information from him before he crossed the horizon. So it all happens in hours, because she is very close to the horizon too.\n\nAs Cooper falls into the black hole, according to Einstein's law, he can see the universe above him, which is the *infalling singularity* (the light and stuff falling to the black hole), and below him is the *outflying singularity*, which is the stuff that fell in the black hole before Cooper. He finds himself sandwiched between those two singularities and soon will be hit by one or the other. \n\nNolan decided that Cooper would be hit by the outflying singularity, because he had adopted for the movie such laws, which prevent objects from travelling back in time. If Cooper were hit by the infalling singularity, he would be so far in the future, that he could only return to the Solar System billions of years in the future, if ever. \n\nCooper is falling at the speed of light, so he doesn't see the infalling singularity, it's chasing him, but not catching him. \n\nAt the edge of the singularity inside the black hole, there is a tesseract waiting for him to save him, put there by the bulk beings ([image](https://analogisfun.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/selection_023.png)).

Only gravity can affect all the dimensions and pass through all the dimensions, our 3D and bulk's 5D membrane, so gravity is the only way to send Murph the message. \n\nIn the end, after he sends her the message, the tesseract starts to close, carrying Cooper through the bulk back to the worm hole (gravitational handshake with Brand) and as the tesseract disappears completely, he is seen floating in the space close to the worm hole, where he was found by the people.", "created_utc": "1649288429.0", "edited": "False", "id": "i3p24j3", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_txrbe6", "parent_id": "t3_txrbe6", "score": "37", "subreddit": "interstellar", "subreddit_id": "t5_2w1k9"}, {"author": "DeepSkyAbyss", "body": "Thank you for your helpful answers and advices.", "created_utc": "1649280954.0", "edited": "False", "id": "i3okqr3", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_txn0pp", "parent_id": "t1_i3ohbzl", "score": "2", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "DeepSkyAbyss", "body": "Do you think that it is a good idea to practice pronouncing different syllables before words?

The guys in the video mention also some weird phenomenons they experienced and other people mention them too:\n\n\\- it's easy to take a wrong turn there, as the turn-offs are often similar\n\n\\- there are lot of old mining shafts, you can easily just fall into them\n\n\\- in some places of Tribe\u010d, the compasses go crazy, showing a wrong direction, same with GPS (it happened to them in the video) - they say it could be caused by the geomagnetic activity of the place\n\n\\- they also describe a sudden deafness in the forest - one of them says it happened to them when they were just collecting mushrooms in the forest, as they live near\n\n\\- they don't believe in supernatural, but while editing the video, they realized that they recorded a voice that did not belong to any of them, saying '\u0160tefan' (Slovak male name), and they have not found an explanation yet", "created_utc": "1603934479.0", "edited": "False", "id": "gag2unp", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_j6ya16", "parent_id": "t1_g86n9rh", "score": "3", "subreddit": "Missing411", "subreddit_id": "t5_31d2x"}, {"author": "DeepSkyAbyss", "body": "[https://spectator.sme.sk/c/20954229/slovakias-middle-class-is-the-richest-in-the-world.html](https://spectator.sme.sk/c/20954229/slovakias-middle-class-is-the-richest-in-the-world.html)", "created_utc": "1603932217.0", "edited": "False", "id": "gafyr72", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_jecv95", "parent_id": "t1_g9euu6r", "score": "3", "subreddit": "europe", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh4j"}, {"author": "DeepSkyAbyss", "body": "Melania is from Slovenia, not Slovakia.", "created_utc": "1603048955.0", "edited": "False", "id": "g990ob0", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_jct25w", "parent_id": "t1_g95lh75", "score": "3", "subreddit": "Coronavirus", "subreddit_id": "t5_2x4yx"}, {"author": "DeepSkyAbyss", "body": "It's the Government who is paying for the tests, not us, they bought them.

Even us who don\u2019t remember living in Czechoslovakia are still in a close daily contact with the other language in TV, books... \u2013 Slovaks more than Czechs.\n\nPersonally - and I am sure that majority of Slovaks would agree \u2013 I am so used to it, that when I hear the Czech language, my brain doesn\u2019t perceive it as a foreign language, but more like a dialect or just a regional variation of my own language. It feels almost as a second native language, as if you were bilingual.\n\nBut even if Slovak and Czech are similar, it doesn\u2019t mean that they are the same. All Slavic languages developed from the proto-Slavic and later they started to differentiate. Three big groups developed (West Slavic, East Slavic and South Slavic) and more languages developed inside every group. How? By speaking with small differences, they all took different turn.\n\nThe West Slavic languages are Polish, Czech, Slovak, Sorbian (there are more, but let\u2018s keep it simplified). I'm gonna use examples from [this paper](https://www.pulib.sk/web/kniznica/elpub/dokument/Sokolova1/subor/2.pdf).\n\nFor example, there were proto-Slavic words containing a consonantic group kv-. While the West Slavic languages preserved this group in those words (flower: Slovak \u2013 kvet, Czech \u2013 kv\u011bt, Polish \u2013 kwiat, Sorbian \u2013 kw\u011bt), in the East Slavic languages it was changed to cv- (Russian \u2013 cvet).\n\nOr the consonantic groups dl-, dm- are present in the West Slavic lang. (Slovak \u2013 radlo, radlica, sedem, Czech \u2013 r\u00e1dlo, radlice, sedm, Polish - rad\u0142o, radlica, siedem, Sorbian \u2013 radlo, radlica), while in the East Slavic lang. the d disappeared from those words (Russian \u2013 ralo, sem).\n\nAnother example, the proto-Slavic tj- was changed to c- in West Slavic lang. (candle: Slovak \u2013 svieca, Czech \u2013 sv\u00edce, Polish \u2013 \u015bwieca, Sorbian \u2013 sw\u011bca), while in the East Slavic lang. it was changed to \u010d- (Russian \u2013 sve\u010da).\n\nSo there are regular differences between the three groups, but also another ones between the languages inside the groups. You can trace the changes in every language and this is what makes them different. And you can see that sometimes the Slovak words are more similar to the Polish or Sorbian ones than to the Czech ones and sometimes not.\n\nMore differences between Slovak and Czech:\n\n\\- the sentence structure in Slovak is synthetic, in Czech it\u2019s analytical\n\n\\- Slovak pronunciation is more flowing (e.g. you pronounce a preposition+noun as one word, not two), in Czech they pronounce them more separately, like two words, and that's why there is also more assimilation in Slovak\n\n\\- there are more consonants in Slovak, but less consonantic groups than in Czech\n\n\\- there are also more vocals and diphthongs in Slovak than in Czech and they are used much more evenly, while in Czech they use in excess i and e\n\n\\- in Slovak there are letters and sounds that don\u2019t exist in Czech (\u00e4, \u00f4, dz, d\u017e, \u013a, \u013e, \u0155, ia, ie, iu) and some Czech that don\u2019t exist in Slovak (\u016f, \u011b, \u0159)\n\n\\- the assimilation of v is different, \u010cajkovsk\u00fd is pronounced like \u010cajkousk\u00fd in Slovak and like \u010cajkofsk\u00fd in Czech\n\n\\- the foreign words school, study, sport are with \u0161 (sh) in Slovak (\u0161kola, \u0161t\u00fadium, \u0161port), but with s in Czech (skola, studium, sport)\n\n\\- lexically, mostly the names of animals and plants are totally different in both languages (camel: SK \u2013 \u0165ava, CZ \u2013 velbloud; turtle: SK \u2013 korytna\u010dka, CZ \u2013 \u017eelva; icicle: SK \u2013 cenc\u00fa\u013e, CZ \u2013 rampouch; July: SK \u2013 j\u00fal, CZ - kv\u011btenec)\n\n\\- and much more.\n\nExample: What\u2019s your name and how old are you?\n\nSK: Ako sa vol\u00e1\u0161 a ko\u013eko m\u00e1\u0161 rokov?\n\nCZ: Jak se jmenuje\u0161 a kolik je ti let?\n\nEdit: corrections", "created_utc": "1589288541.0", "edited": "1589367164.0", "id": "fqdfjpl", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_gf22se", "parent_id": "t1_fpsuagc", "score": "1", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i"}, {"author": "DeepSkyAbyss", "body": "The international airport in Bratislava is named after the general Milan Rastislav \u0160tef\u00e1nik, one of the three founders of Czechoslovakia, who died in a plane crash in 1919.", "created_utc": "1589197586.0", "edited": "False", "id": "fq9gkqz", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_ghkv0q", "parent_id": "t1_fq9ch5d", "score": "51", "subreddit": "europe", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh4j"}, {"author": "DeepSkyAbyss", "body": "Same in Slovakia. \"Mail\" in spoken language may be used more than \"e-mail\", but still, we don't say \"gmail\", just when we really mean Gmail.", "created_utc": "1589194137.0", "edited": "False", "id": "fq9d0y6", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_ghiu9u", "parent_id": "t1_fq98rwz", "score": "66", "subreddit": "AskEurope", "subreddit_id": "t5_2uayg"}, {"author": "DeepSkyAbyss", "body": "Years ago a few songs of Zdob si Zdub were popular in Slovakia.

If they can't come, they may let you know in advance, so you don't wait for them. \n\nBut it is not obligatory, not every man does this tradition. As a woman, you buy the chocolate eggs and stuff in advance - you know how many men/boys of your family usually come, so you buy something for every one of them. And you can also buy some more, just in case someone new comes. Usually the fathers take their sons with them and when they are adults and don't live together anymore, they can come separately. But it's still better to go with someone, because one can ride and it's better to visit with someone, I guess.\n\nBut anyone you know and lives nearyou  can come to visit you, it's up to you if you let them in. I have a secret code with my family, so when they ring the doorbell, I know it's them and I let them in. When I was in the primary school, sometimes one or two schoolmates came to visit me too. I wasn't expecting them, but I had some chocolate eggs for them too. Or you just pretend you are not at home and don't let them in. But that was years ago, I don't have an idea how the kids do it nowadays.\n\nAlso, I don't know how other families do it, but we give money just to the kids - my two cousins and one kid related. Two of them are adults already, so it's a little awkward - are you still supposed to give them money? It was supposed to be just a pocket money for kids, so...\n\nThe age doesn't matter. A father will take his baby son with him, so he enjoyes the tradition since childhood, and the grandmother usually wants to see her little grandson.

As someone already commented, the female surnames certainly don\u2019t mean \"belongs to\", it's a common misunderstanding and I can show you why some people believe it.\n\nThere are three types of Slovak **adjectives** (we learn this already at primary school, so every Slovak should know it):\n\n**1) Qualitative**. They describe a quality: mal\u00fd ^(male), mal\u00e1 ^(female), mal\u00e9 ^(neuter) (small), nov\u00fd, nov\u00e1, nov\u00e9 (new), m\u00fadry, m\u00fadra, m\u00fadre (wise). They can be compared, graded: mal\u00fd \u2013 men\u0161\u00ed - najmen\u0161\u00ed (small \u2013 smaller \u2013 the smallest), nov\u00fd \u2013 nov\u0161\u00ed \u2013 najnov\u0161\u00ed (new \u2013 newer \u2013 the newest).\n\n**2) Relational.** They describe a relationship: papierov\u00fd, papierov\u00e1, papierov\u00e9 (relative to papier - paper), morsk\u00fd, morsk\u00e1, morsk\u00e9 (relative to more - sea), pracovn\u00fd, pracovn\u00e1, pracovn\u00e9 (relative to pr\u00e1ca - work). They cannot be compared.\n\n**3) Possessive.** They describe belonging to a person or an animal: otcov, otcova, otcovo (father\u2019s), matkin, matkina, matkino (mother\u2019s), l\u00ed\u0161\u010d\u00ed (fox\u2019s).\n\nExamples:\n\n1. mal\u00fd dom (small house), nov\u00fd dom (new house)\n2. papierov\u00fd dom (paper house), letn\u00fd dom (summer house)\n3. otcov dom (father\u2019s house), matkin dom (mother\u2019s house), l\u00ed\u0161\u010d\u00ed dom (fox\u2019s house)\n\n\\------\n\nThe Slovak **female surnames** are **adjectives** and they end with \u2013ov\u00e1, not \u2013ova. It looks like a small difference (\u00e1 \u2013 a), but it is a big difference in meaning. Because **\u2013ov\u00e1** is a suffix of **Relational Adjectives (2)**, they describe a relationship, while \u2013ova is a suffix of Possessive Adjectives (3).\n\nIf you look at the Slovak **male surnames**, they can be either **noun** or **adjective**.\n\n**Nouns** are Grman, L\u00ed\u0161ka (Fox), Kov\u00e1\u010d (Blacksmith), Nemec (German) ( one of our professional soccer players is called Adam Nemec, he played in the USA too) etc.\n\n**Adjectives** are Vesel\u00fd (Happy), Horsk\u00fd (Mountainy), \u010cierny (Black), but also the possessive ones like Al\u017ebetkin (Elisabeth\u2019s) \u2013 like the actor J\u00e1n Al\u017ebetkin, or Kuk\u010d\u00edn (Kuku\u010da\u2019s) \u2013 like the famous Slovak writer Martin Kuku\u010d\u00edn (his mother had a nickname Kuku\u010da) etc.\n\nSlovak **female surnames** are all **adjectives**.  They are created either by adding the relational suffix \u2013ov\u00e1 to the **noun** male surname (Grman \u2013 Grmanov\u00e1, L\u00ed\u0161ka \u2013 L\u00ed\u0161kov\u00e1, Kov\u00e1\u010d \u2013 Kov\u00e1\u010dov\u00e1, Nemec \u2013 Nemcov\u00e1) or, if the male surname is already a Qualitative (1) or Relational (2) adjective, the female surname will have the **female form** of the adjective (Vesel\u00fd \u2013 Vesel\u00e1, Horsk\u00fd \u2013 Horsk\u00e1, \u010cierny \u2013 \u010cierna). If the male surname has a Possessive Adjective (3) form, you add \u2013ov\u00e1 to it, too (Al\u017ebetkin \u2013 Al\u017ebetkinov\u00e1, Kuku\u010d\u00edn \u2013 Kuku\u010d\u00ednov\u00e1). And this is another proof that \u2013ov\u00e1 is **not possessive**, because you cannot add two possessive suffixes to a word (Al\u017ebetk-in^(possessive) \\-ov\u00e1^(relational)).\n\nEdit: added male, female and neuter forms in (1), (2) and (3) and the last word description", "created_utc": "1585326207.0", "edited": "1585326663.0", "id": "flnunxi", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_fpksgu", "parent_id": "t1_fllxqxj", "score": "5", "subreddit": "Slovakia", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qyjb"}, {"author": "DeepSkyAbyss", "body": "Rovnako Nemcov naz\u00fdvaj\u00fa aj v niektor\u00fdch \u010fal\u0161\u00edch slovansk\u00fdch jazykoch.

German in Slovak is Nemec (meaning 'the mute one', because Slovaks didn't understand them).\n\nThe suffix -ov\u00e1 has its significance just in Slovakia, because it is necessary for a proper declension in Slovak language - for example, all men with their male surnames can be used in a sentence with a proper male declensions, and all the women with female surnames can be used in a sentence with a proper female declensions.

It looks like we have some thing in common, when celebrating Christmas. The Vitel ton\u00e9 looks delicious on pictures and it's very logical that you eat mostly cold food, because it's summer. I would love to eat fruit salad with ice cream on Christmas. \n\nJust like you, we start our celebration with family dinner on the 24th at 5 or 6 pm, when the first star shows up on the sky - it's already dark outside. The dinner consists of numerous courses. We start with *waffles with honey* (and garlic), then we eat hot *cabbage soup* with meat and mushrooms called *kapustnica* (in some regions they eat fish soup or lentil soup). The main meal is *fish* (traditionally carp, but not the most frequent) with *mayonnaise salad* \\- I think that it's very similar to the russian salad that you eat. In some regions people eat also pirohy (or pierogi), small cakes with poppy seeds, cake with four different fillings, or different types of porridge.\n\nWe also have a lot of traditions - we cut an apple in halves and if the seeds form a star, the family will be healthy next year. Every member of the family gets one piece of the apple to be healthy. We put money or fish scale under the plates, we can't left the table during the dinner, so nobody dies next year, we put one more empty plate on the table, and others.\n\nAfter the dinner, we open the presents, eat cakes and watch traditional Christmas movies. At midnight some religious people go to the church to midnight mass. While you watch fireworks, our Christmas is very quiet and calm - most of the day is dark and the snow is making everything even more quiet. And the next days we eat the leftovers too :)", "created_utc": "1575315634.0", "edited": "False", "id": "f9hibhd", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_e4i0q9", "parent_id": "t1_f9eft41", "score": "2", "subreddit": "Slovakia", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qyjb"}, {"author": "DeepSkyAbyss", "body": "In Slovak: \"My o vlku a vlk za humnami.\"\n\n\"We (speak) of the wolf and the wolf (is) behind the backyard.\"\n\nAlso: \"Spome\u0148 \u010derta a \u010dert za dverami.\"\n\n\"Speak of the devil and the devil (is) behind the door.\"", "created_utc": "1575296326.0", "edited": "False", "id": "f9gathd", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_e4onta", "parent_id": "t1_f9ffs9g", "score": "1", "subreddit": "MapPorn", "subreddit_id": "t5_2si92"}, {"author": "DeepSkyAbyss", "body": "In Slovak we had similar protoslavic names, now using the latin ones.

But there is an explanation.\n\nBasically, the **perfective** verbs are **notional** (i.e. they have the full lexical meaning of the verb), so they are just carrying the **meaning** of the verb = they actually mean, what they express. While the **imperfective** verbs are non-notional.\n\n\\--------------------------------\n\n(Not the same thing, but maybe you will understand better what's notional in these examples:\n\n**Do** you know? = the verb '**do**' is auxiliar here, it doesn't bring the meaning of 'do' to the sentence\n\n**Do** it now. = the verb '**do**' here actually means 'to do', the meaning is expressed in the sentence, it's notional\n\n**Tenemos** que ganar. = the verb '**tenemos**' does not express the meaning of 'tenemos' here\n\n**Tenemos** un libro. = the verb '**tenemos**' does express the meaning of 'tenemos' here, it's notional)\n\n\\--------------------------------\n\nSo, now we know which aspect is notional (perf.) and which is non-notional (imperf.).\n\nThe aspect of verbs is closely related to the **tenses**. The **present** tense is **non-notional**, so you **can't** use the notional (perfective) aspect in present tense. And that's why the **perfective** verbs are **missing** the **present** tense:\n\n**Vystupovat** (imperf.) > vystupovali jsme (past) - vystupujeme (present) - budeme vystupovat (future)\n\n**Vystoupit** (perf.) > vystoupili jsme (past) - **XXXX** (present) - vystoup\u00edme (future)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"**Vystupujeme** tady.\" (We are getting off here.) (Bajamos aqu\u00ed.) = present tense\n\n\"**Vystoup\u00edme** tady.\" (We will get off here.) (Bajaremos aqu\u00ed.) = future tense\n\nYou can feel the difference in meaning even in the Spanish and English translations here.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso, the **non-notional** imperfective verbs are more **expressive**. You use them, for example, when you want to order someone to do something:\n\n\"**Vystup**!\" (Get off!) (\u00a1B\u00e1jate!) = perf., this is the normal way to say the order, it's not expressive\n\n\"**Vystupuj**!\" (Get off!) (\u00a1B\u00e1jate!) = imperf., gramatically you should not use this, but you want to make the order more expressive, so you use it\n\nFor example, in Spanish: \"Te **me** cuidas.\" = using 'me' you are making it more expressive than saying just \"Te cuidas\". It's more affectionate.\n\nIn any language, using any word expressively is more a thing of a linguistic **tradition** than a thing of some rigid rules, that's why it is so difficult to learn these things. The best way to learn it is by watching the natives using it and **immitating,** until you can feel it intuitively.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd last but not least, the **imperfective** verbs are expressing the **action**, the course of the action, the movement, all the steps that are involved, while the **perfective** verbs, being notional, are emphasizing just the meaning of the verb, the **result** of the action, not the action itself.\n\n\"**Vystupujeme** tady.\" (imperf.) = We will see some action here: here on this place we are going to do some action, some process, that will result into us being outside of the bus\n\n\"**Vystoup\u00edme** tady.\" (perf.) = We will see some result here: we are going to literally get off here\n\nLet me know if it helped you, [u/OSB2018](https://www.reddit.com/user/OSB2018/)", "created_utc": "1558814658.0", "edited": "1558876945.0", "id": "eory12v", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_bsryxg", "parent_id": "t3_bsryxg", "score": "3", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "DeepSkyAbyss", "body": "In [this](https://forum.wordreference.com/threads/slovak-etymol%C3%B3gia-p%C3%A1%C4%8Di%C5%A5-sa.1554531/) forum someone mentions that in a Slovak linguistic journal ([Slovensk\u00e1 re\u010d](http://www.juls.savba.sk/ediela/sr/1970/5/sr1970-5-lq.pdf), 1970, pp. 257-264) they say that the word *p\u00e1\u010di\u0165 sa* comes from the protoslavic *pa\u010diti* (to look, to see, to watch).

Czechs were more centralists, while Slovaks more autonomous.\n\nAfter the Velvet Revolution in 1989 the Czech and the Slovak politicians couldn't even agree on the name of Czechoslovakia ([Hyphen War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyphen_War)): it was \u010ceskoslovensko in Czechia and \u010cesko-Slovensko in Slovakia; \u010cesko-Slovensko is still the correct orthographic Slovak form nowadays.\n\nIn 1992 the politicians were discussing what would the democratic country (federation at that moment) look like after the fall of communism. The Czechs wanted more centralization and Slovaks wanted a confederation. The politicians V\u00e1clav Klaus (Czech) and Vladim\u00edr Me\u010diar (Slovak) talked about it privately, as you can see in [this](https://t.aimg.sk/magaziny/qkmYWpYWRf3o_4-ejaX3hg.1280~Video-Kto-skuto-ne-rozdelil-eskoslovensko.jpg?t=LzB4MTM6MTI4MHg3MzMvODAweDQ1MC9zbWFydA%3D%3D&h=fLwF0KRNL_EeS_ea0ZtFTQ&e=2145916800&v=1) historical photo, and they decided to split the country. (Some popular unofficial opinions say they did it so they both could have and govern a country on their own.) There was no referendum about splitting and the polls were showing that just 1/3 of both Czechs and Slovaks wanted to split.\n\nNowadays, a majority of both nations are ok with being independent, but of course, there are still some people who feel nostalgic about Czechoslovakia.\n\nReunifying? I think it is impossible. Both countries are going different ways already and Slovakia is more integrated and pro-european, while Czech Republic is more traditional. There would not even be an agreement about the currency (euro vs czech koruna). And it would also be useless, we are both members of the EU, there are no real borders and we are still very close in every way, economic and cultural, the things are perfect now, our relationship is better than ever without any conflict, so there is no need to force it together again. 100 years ago the idea of czechoslovakism was an existencial thing, but it has died years ago already. \n\n(OT: Just a small correction of a common mistake: Czech Republic is the equivalent of French Republic, so when you say just Czech, it's as if you were saying French, not a name of the country.

Woman here. I am sorry that you feel like this. Do you know Nick Vujicic? He was born with no legs and no arms. He has a wife now and four children. He is a big inspiration. \n\nIf I've learned something, it's that in reality nothing is as bad as it seems. Women (not *all* of them) don't love men because of their strenght or masculinity (not even the physical masculinity, see how many women like feminine-like men). If a woman will love you, she will love you because of your smile, your words, your sense of humor, your inner energy and confidence. Good vibes and confidence can make up for any defect. Think about people - famous or not - that you consider interesting or attractive not because of their looks, but because of their personality. You can take an inspiration from them. \n\nNobody likes negative, sad or self-pitying people, even if they were the most beautiful people on the world. It's good that you know your week points, but it's the kind of things you can do nothing about. But you still have a lot of things that you can make your main features. If you are skinny, you naturaly attract women that like skinny men. If you are funny, you attract women that like funny men. It is a lot of little things that make you *you*, and not just your weaknesses, but also your strengths - and you have them, everyone have them, just let them be seen. \n\nIt's just like in fashion, everyone has some problem areas on their body and the point is to kind of hide them by accentuating your best features. If you are very tall and consider it your problem, you can't make yourself shorter, but you can make yourself *seem* shorter, for example by wearing horizontal lines. If a woman has small breasts, she can focus an attention to something else of her body. See? In the everyday life everyone is trying to accentuate their best features, even the models. \n\nBelieve me, there are women for every man and there are men for every woman, because people like different things. And it is not pitying, it is just different preferences, or even better, a perfect match. :)", "created_utc": "1555953334.0", "edited": "False", "id": "eli9ud5", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_bg2idw", "parent_id": "t3_bg2idw", "score": "13", "subreddit": "PsoriaticArthritis", "subreddit_id": "t5_2zyfd"}, {"author": "DeepSkyAbyss", "body": "Facebook.
