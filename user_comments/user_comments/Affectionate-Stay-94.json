So, I got this feeling from watching the show is that while I fucking adore the iconic scenes of the first half, I feel like the pace of the plot slowed down in the last half and, with week-long waits, the episodes felt choppy and incoherent. I was worried about the ending when someone said Anzai Chika-san\u2019s favorite ep to voice was ep 9. Why ep 9, not 13? A favorite show for me is a show with a satisfying ending, that\u2019s why it worried me. With that many themes, from arnachy and heroism from Majima, to authority from DA, to missions of life from Alan Institution, to selfishness and selflessness from the main pair, I knew nothing will be dissected in depth. And of course, there was no way the romance would have born fruits by the end of this show, I thought, with Takina being oblivious of same-sex love well into half of the show. While I still love this series, in retrospect, the selling point to me was the characters: they\u2019re so lovable, worthy of a comfy SoL. Actions: it was quite some eye candy tho. When it comes to plot and impact, I don\u2019t think so.\n\nWhat if they went for the romance route? I imagine a love with visible hints of endearing first-perspective thoughts, even darker and more gruesome circumstances, even more danger, more confessions of true feelings, emotional damages flying everywhere. For an action-romance show, this might entails the show being longer, but I wouldn\u2019t mind. That\u2019s the furthest I can imagine, but if it had been like that, whew, what a show it would turned out. Would be cool if someone take the og characters and rewrite the whole thing, waiting for the fanfics after the finale.\n\nEdit: Plus, if they love each other romantically, or if the finale having them lying next to each other and laugh after the fight (or dare I say, even if parting in Death), the ED theme would hit so fucking hard. To fill this hole of this ending, gonna rewatch the whole Revue Starlight series plus Movie twice for musical girlfriends fighting and saving each other.

And this is the thing: do I ever do that to someone not close? Never. It seems like I had a habit of hurting close ones with words, knowing that somehow I\u2019d be forgiven. And sometimes from that actions I saw myself as selfish, heartless, beastlike and cold-blooded, as if I\u2019d lost every piece of humanity inside me, and as quick as I felt guilty, I acted as if nothing happened and just continued with my wrongdoings. That sucked, as if I\u2019d stay like that forever, being a jerk.

Yeah, maybe there\u2019s some way like put electricity in your brain areas and make you a calmer person, but for me it\u2019s a bit artificial, unfeasible and temporary. But, in the end, only looking around for advice is not enough, and the results are down to the person to change. People don\u2019t just magically get better, this need goals, small goals and a track of progress like building any other habits. Just remember to not let the past define your entire identity, and what you can do. Knowing the problem is the first step to change, but it\u2019s not enough to take that one step only, do whatever it takes to improve is the way.

I think it's quite a shame that many Vietnamese people don't understand the meaning of individual elements, but this ignorance can make the rediscovering process of one's own language through a foreign language quite interesting.\n\nThe dictionary I used for Chinese elements in general: [https://hvdic.thivien.net/hv](https://hvdic.thivien.net/hv) \n\nThis dictionary is powered by this poem website, if you're interested:\n\n[https://www.thivien.net/](https://www.thivien.net/)", "created_utc": "1654968788.0", "edited": "1654969193.0", "id": "ibzu57k", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_v1l6e7", "parent_id": "t1_ibzsagh", "score": "2", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "Affectionate-Stay-94", "body": "Well, yes, and no. Ok, take \"cold\" as an example. Normally we say, \"l\u1ea1nh\", or \"r\u00e9t\". In Sino-phonetic transcription (Not sure what it's called, but I'll use this), it is \"h\u00e0n\", which is \u5bd2 in Chinese. These type of phonetic transcription is used for transcribing old poem into readable stuff, and each of them is analyzed in meaning as individual Chinese character in Literature classes. Chinese elements like \"cold\" or \"red\" or stuff are used more formally and met frequently in in compound words and names only; they never stand alone. If we want to say \"the red color\", we say \"\u0111\u1ecf\", not \"h\u1ed3ng\" \u7d05, because \"h\u1ed3ng\" normally means \"pink\" lol. A compound word: \"can \u0111\u1ea3m\" \u809d\u80c6 (literally \"liver+gallbladder), meaning \"brave, courageous\". This is the same as how English words can also be traced back to Latin or French roots or primitives. We can say that some of the Sino elements were adopted and \"localized\", like the On'yomi of Japanese. These elements then can be used as standalone words, such as \"flower\" \u82b1: hoa. Besides them, we have other words derived from minor ethic languages such as Muong or Mon-Khmer, called \"T\u1eeb thu\u1ea7n Vi\u1ec7t\" (Pure Vietnamese Words), which are comparable to Japanese Kun\u2019yomi.\n\n[https://vi.wikipedia.org/wiki/T%E1%BB%AB\\_thu%E1%BA%A7n\\_Vi%E1%BB%87t#:\\~:text=T%C6%B0%C6%A1ng%20%E1%BB%A9ng%20Vi%E1%BB%87t%2DM%C6%B0%E1%BB%9Dng%3A%20v%E1%BB%A3,%2C%20g%C3%A0%2C%20tr%E1%BB%A9ng\u2026](https://vi.wikipedia.org/wiki/T%E1%BB%AB_thu%E1%BA%A7n_Vi%E1%BB%87t#:~:text=T%C6%B0%C6%A1ng%20%E1%BB%A9ng%20Vi%E1%BB%87t%2DM%C6%B0%E1%BB%9Dng%3A%20v%E1%BB%A3,%2C%20g%C3%A0%2C%20tr%E1%BB%A9ng\u2026)\n\nTo translate some words in the link:\n\nCorresponding with Viet-Muong Origin: v\u1ee3 (wife), ch\u1ed3ng (husband), \u0103n (eat), u\u1ed1ng (drink), c\u01b0\u1eddi (smile), b\u01a1i (swim), n\u1eb1m (lie down), kh\u00e1t (thirsty), tr\u1ed1n (hide), g\u00e1y (crowing of chicken/nape?), m\u1ecf (beak), m\u00e2m (round tray), r\u00e1 (closely-woven basket), chum (big clay pots), n\u1ed3i (pots), v\u00e1y (dress), c\u01a1m (rice), c\u00e2y (tree), c\u1ee7 (tuber), r\u1ea1 (rice\u2019s remaining roots after harvesting), m\u00e2y (cloud), cau (Areca catechu, a palm tree), g\u00e0 (chicken), tr\u1ee9ng (egg)...
