So firstly I will be evaluating all of the idols as vocalists, so timbre or tone, which are subjective and vary on taste, wont be considered.\n\nRegarding your first point, bts hasnt improved their technique significantly since debut. The only ones which have made attempts to support are jungkook and taehyung. Both of them are heavily stylistic vocalists though. \n\nJungkook uses an extremely breathy approach, mostly to achieve his famous falsetto trademark sound, which does minimize strain to an extent, but causes chord closure. Overall his placement is very nasal and his approach is rather \"whiny\". His support overall is shallow and hes relaxed up to F4. Would say he improved a bit, since he only had E4/Eb4, but the difference isnt that big.\n\nTaehyung probably still has the best sense of best support in bts. He is still shallow throughout his range. Overall Im not sure if hes a baritone or a tenor. Personally I think hes a tenor, because he doesnt have a lot of vocal weight, but that would maybe downgrade him a bit, even though he has supported some decent low notes. Would say he carries some support up until C#4. I havent heard a lot of improvement so far from him.\n\nSo, would say, no significant changes in their technique as vocalists. Improvement is rarer than no improvement  though, so thats pretty standard for kpop. I would go as far as say 90% of vocalists in kpop dont Improve.\n\nFor the second point, I need some live clips to evaluate, since I know A.C.E. but Im not familiar with them.", "created_utc": "1641598111.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hrpg1a6", "is_submitter": "True", "link_id": "t3_rydcbp", "parent_id": "t1_hrp3yq7", "score": "10", "subreddit": "kpophelp", "subreddit_id": "t5_2vyk1"}, {"author": "mochi0077", "body": "Firstly, I think both are interlinked, even though It is possible to sing live without support. An Example would be Itzy, which sing live, pretty close to their orginal track but all of them dont really have a degree of support, except for Lia occasionally up to A4 and very nasal. Now singing like this is possible, but singing with support is the only healthy way to maintain your vocal chords over a long period of time. Reason why we see vocalists like Ock Joohyun still thriving, because of her great technique, thus not damaging her vocal chords, or Taeyeon for example.\n\nNow Haechan isnt NCTs best vocalist, but hes a W-A (weak to average vocalist on the KVA scale, Im using the KVA scale, because it is the most known to kpop fans) which places him pretty high in NCTs hierarchy, maybe 5th or 6th place. Hes doesnt have the highest level of technique and he does have some basics and quite a few bad habits (probably because of stylistic choices), but it allows to be able to belt out while on stage, mostly straining, which wont be good for him in the long run.\n\nRegarding your second paragraph, I can hear the degree of support in a vocalists voice and I think support is the only objective basis that we can rank kpop vocalists on. Although the category is a lot less strict in kpop, resonance is a controversial topic for example and personally I think it has a lower bar in kpop, but thats a whole nother discussion. \n\nNow the level of a vocalists support or development doesnt really affect my enjoyment mostly, unless its painfully apparent, but then I think the average listener also wouldnt enjoy them.

There are groups like Mamamoo, who have an overall great level for a group and probably the highest average skill, but I suspect that RBW recruited them at a rather good level of either potential or skill.

His falsetto goes up to F#5, but again really strained.\n\nA misconception among kpop fans, is that if you have healthy vocal technique, you have to sacrifice your style and have a \"boring\" tone as a lot of kpop fans like to say it.

D.O. from EXO, Baekhyun from EXO, Onew from SHINee, Jonghyun from SHINee (If Jungkook developed his technique, I imagine him sounding like Jonghyun), Yesung from Super Junior, etc \n\nIn reality, most of it depends on vocal training with proper coaches.

So you would get [dance practices ](https://youtu.be/1yQjsWhOuJI) and [performances](https://youtu.be/Queo2h3zdA4) for every song. When a group releases a new song/album its called a comeback (regardless of when they released their last song/album)\n\nDifferent kpop groups have specialties theyre known for as well. \n\nExample: \"Seventeen\" is known for their synchronized dancing and performances, theyre known as a well rounded group in talent. \n\n\"Red Velvet\" is known for their singing, especially their unique set of voices and R&B style singing, also theyre known for unique \"concepts\". \n\nA concept is basically a style, like \"[cool](https://youtu.be/HdZdxocqzq4)\", \"[sexy](https://youtu.be/E0ZHXVp_wUE)\", \"[cute](https://youtu.be/c7rCyll5AeY)\", \"[teencrush](https://youtu.be/pNfTK39k55U)\", \"[manly](https://youtu.be/-ToHbHcolfA)\", \"[fresh/young](https://youtu.be/W3iSnJ663II)\" and \"[girlcrush](https://youtu.be/2S24-y0Ij3Y)\"\n\n(If you click on each of them youll find an example of each concept, these are just some examples, there are many more concepts that I havent mentioned)\n\nThere are also many crossovers like \"[cute+sexy](https://youtu.be/9txzvu6eQuw)\", \"[cute+girlcrush](https://youtu.be/KhTeiaCezwM)\" and many more\n\nMembers of each group have a position within a group, so there are dance, vocal and rap positions.\nHere is [blackpinks profile](https://kprofiles.com/black-pink-members-profile/) as an example \n\nThere are many more positions, like \n\nvisual (considered prettiest/most attractive by korean standards, usually gets modelling gigs/acting gigs)\n\ncenter (member that is in the front during the most memorable parts of the song like the chorus, usually the most eyecatching/charismatic one is the center, but it isnt always a fixed position, so members may take turns being the center depending on comeback)\n\nleader (member who is responsible for leading the team, solving issues between members, kind of like class president)\n\nEach group/artist has a fandom name, like for BTS its ARMY, for Seventeen its CARAT and for Red Velvet its ReVeluv, etc\n\nFancafes are a place to interact with your fandom and group. And no, it isnt an actual cafe. Its like a forum, where you chat/interact with the fandom and the group. Mostly you have to pay to enter and you can only enter at a specific time, maybe its only open for new entrees every half a year, etc\n\nYou can also meet a lot of fans on twitter (but behold the twitter stans are toxic af), reddit (hi), youtube (a lot of fan content there), discord, etc\n\nNow Ill give you a quick overview over some of the most popular groups right now:\n\nBTS: \n\n- no 1 kpop group popularity wise\n- boygroup \n- 7 members\n- known for their great rapping and dancing\n- compose/write/produce most of their albums themselves \n- their main theme throughout their albums is \"LOVE YOURSELF\"\n- have a storyline through their mvs and albums\n- fans known as ARMY\n\nhere are some of their most famous/impactful songs:\n\n[Blood, Sweat and Tears](https://youtu.be/hmE9f-TEutc)\n\n[DNA](https://youtu.be/MBdVXkSdhwU)\n\n[Fake Love](https://youtu.be/7C2z4GqqS5E)\n\n[Spring Day](https://youtu.be/xEeFrLSkMm8)\n\n[idol](https://youtu.be/pBuZEGYXA6E)\n\n[Boy With Luv](https://youtu.be/gdZLi9oWNZg)\n\n\nSEVENTEEN \n\n- strong fandom\n- members from China, Japan, Korea, America (mixed American-Korean)\n- known for synchronized dance and wellrounded talent (everyone can sing/rap and dance well)\n- 13 members, are separated into 3 units, hiphop unit(rap based), vocal unit and performance unit(dance&choreography based)\n- make their own choreography & write a lot of their music\n- fans known as CARAT\n\nhere are some of their most famous/impactful songs:\n\n[Very Nice](https://youtu.be/KvA9T3MputA)\n\n[Dont Wanna Cry](https://youtu.be/zEkg4GBQumc)\n\n[Clap](https://youtu.be/CyzEtbG-sxY)\n\n[HOME;RUN](https://youtu.be/UB4FzllQCyc)\n\n[Mansae](https://youtu.be/9M7k9ZV67c0)\n\n[Pretty U](https://youtu.be/J5juKw-mnGw)\n\nEXO\n\n- nations boy group\n- boygroup\n- used to be 12 members, now consist of 9 \n- known for great vocals and dance\n- used to make winter albums (showcasing their strong vocals and mellow side) and normal albums where they show off their great dancing and unique songs and concepts\n- have a storyline in their music, which also includes the members having different superpowers\n- used to have EXO-M and EXO-K concept (EXO-M used to make chinese versions of the EXO-K songs, but all 12 members united in 2013 and made only korean comebacks since then)\n- fans known as EXO-L\n\nhere are some of their most famous/impactful songs:\n\n[growl](https://youtu.be/I3dezFzsNss)\n\n[call me baby](https://youtu.be/yWfsla_Uh80)\n\n[monster](https://youtu.be/KSH-FVVtTf0)\n\n[kokobop](https://youtu.be/IdssuxDdqKk)\n\n[tempo](https://youtu.be/iwd8N6K-sLk)\n\n[love shot](https://youtu.be/pSudEWBAYRE)\n\n[obsession ](https://youtu.be/uxmP4b2a0uY)\n\nhere are some songs from their winter albums:\n\n[Miracles In December ](https://youtu.be/yVLxRXoLaas)\n\n[For Life](https://youtu.be/DTiZ0aCm3rs)\n\nNCT\n\n- nct stands for neo culture technology \n- unlimited members concept (23 members right now)\n- members are divided into subunits \n- boygroup\n- known for hardhitting songs, great rap, dance and also vocals and obviously the unlimited member concept\n- units:\n\n nct dream: members under 20 are in this subunit and once youre 20 you \"graduate\" from it, this concepr was demolished though since fans gave a lot of backlash, so now all the orginal members are still in the unit, except 1 (because he graduated before the backlash on the graduation concept i think)\n\nnct u: each comeback they have new members, can be anyone from the currently 23 members\n\nnct 127: 127 stands for the coordinates of seoul (capitol of south korea), they have 10 members (9 active and 1 inactive member due to china -

So you would get [dance practices ](https://youtu.be/1yQjsWhOuJI) and [performances](https://youtu.be/Queo2h3zdA4) for every song. When a group releases a new song/album its called a comeback (regardless of when they released their last song/album)\n\nDifferent kpop groups have specialties theyre known for as well. \n\nExample: \"Seventeen\" is known for their synchronized dancing and performances, theyre known as a well rounded group in talent. \n\n\"Red Velvet\" is known for their singing, especially their unique set of voices and R&B style singing, also theyre known for unique \"concepts\". \n\nA concept is basically a style, like \"[cool](https://youtu.be/HdZdxocqzq4)\", \"[sexy](https://youtu.be/E0ZHXVp_wUE)\", \"[cute](https://youtu.be/c7rCyll5AeY)\", \"[teencrush](https://youtu.be/pNfTK39k55U)\", \"[manly](https://youtu.be/-ToHbHcolfA)\", \"[fresh/young](https://youtu.be/W3iSnJ663II)\" and \"[girlcrush](https://youtu.be/2S24-y0Ij3Y)\"\n\n(If you click on each of them youll find an example of each concept, these are just some examples, there are many more concepts that I havent mentioned)\n\nThere are also many crossovers like \"[cute+sexy](https://youtu.be/9txzvu6eQuw)\", \"[cute+girlcrush](https://youtu.be/KhTeiaCezwM)\" and many more\n\nMembers of each group have a position within a group, so there are dance, vocal and rap positions.\nHere is [blackpinks profile](https://kprofiles.com/black-pink-members-profile/) as an example \n\nThere are many more positions, like \n\nvisual (considered prettiest/most attractive by korean standards, usually gets modelling gigs/acting gigs)\n\ncenter (member that is in the front during the most memorable parts of the song like the chorus, usually the most eyecatching/charismatic one is the center, but it isnt always a fixed position, so members may take turns being the center depending on comeback)\n\nleader (member who is responsible for leading the team, solving issues between members, kind of like class president)\n\nEach group/artist has a fandom name, like for BTS its ARMY, for Seventeen its CARAT and for Red Velvet its ReVeluv, etc\n\nFancafes are a place to interact with your fandom and group. And no, it isnt an actual cafe. Its like a forum, where you chat/interact with the fandom and the group. Mostly you have to pay to enter and you can only enter at a specific time, maybe its only open for new entrees every half a year, etc\n\nYou can also meet a lot of fans on twitter (but behold the twitter stans are toxic af), reddit (hi), youtube (a lot of fan content there), discord, etc\n\nNow Ill give you a quick overview over some of the most popular groups right now:\n\nBTS: \n\n- no 1 kpop group popularity wise\n- boygroup \n- 7 members\n- known for their great rapping and dancing\n- compose/write/produce most of their albums themselves \n- their main theme throughout their albums is \"LOVE YOURSELF\"\n- have a storyline through their mvs and albums\n- fans known as ARMY\n\nhere are some of their most famous/impactful songs:\n\n[Blood, Sweat and Tears](https://youtu.be/hmE9f-TEutc)\n\n[DNA](https://youtu.be/MBdVXkSdhwU)\n\n[Fake Love](https://youtu.be/7C2z4GqqS5E)\n\n[Spring Day](https://youtu.be/xEeFrLSkMm8)\n\n[idol](https://youtu.be/pBuZEGYXA6E)\n\n[Boy With Luv](https://youtu.be/gdZLi9oWNZg)\n\n\nSEVENTEEN \n\n- strong fandom\n- members from China, Japan, Korea, America (mixed American-Korean)\n- known for synchronized dance and wellrounded talent (everyone can sing/rap and dance well)\n- 13 members, are separated into 3 units, hiphop unit(rap based), vocal unit and performance unit(dance&choreography based)\n- make their own choreography & write a lot of their music\n- fans known as CARAT\n\nhere are some of their most famous/impactful songs:\n\n[Very Nice](https://youtu.be/KvA9T3MputA)\n\n[Dont Wanna Cry](https://youtu.be/zEkg4GBQumc)\n\n[Clap](https://youtu.be/CyzEtbG-sxY)\n\n[HOME;RUN](https://youtu.be/UB4FzllQCyc)\n\n[Mansae](https://youtu.be/9M7k9ZV67c0)\n\n[Pretty U](https://youtu.be/J5juKw-mnGw)\n\nEXO\n\n- nations boy group\n- boygroup\n- used to be 12 members, now consist of 9 \n- known for great vocals and dance\n- used to make winter albums (showcasing their strong vocals and mellow side) and normal albums where they show off their great dancing and unique songs and concepts\n- have a storyline in their music, which also includes the members having different superpowers\n- used to have EXO-M and EXO-K concept (EXO-M used to make chinese versions of the EXO-K songs, but all 12 members united in 2013 and made only korean comebacks since then)\n- fans known as EXO-L\n\nhere are some of their most famous/impactful songs:\n\n[growl](https://youtu.be/I3dezFzsNss)\n\n[call me baby](https://youtu.be/yWfsla_Uh80)\n\n[monster](https://youtu.be/KSH-FVVtTf0)\n\n[kokobop](https://youtu.be/IdssuxDdqKk)\n\n[tempo](https://youtu.be/iwd8N6K-sLk)\n\n[love shot](https://youtu.be/pSudEWBAYRE)\n\n[obsession ](https://youtu.be/uxmP4b2a0uY)\n\nhere are some songs from their winter albums:\n\n[Miracles In December ](https://youtu.be/yVLxRXoLaas)\n\n[For Life](https://youtu.be/DTiZ0aCm3rs)\n\nNCT\n\n- nct stands for neo culture technology \n- unlimited members concept (23 members right now)\n- members are divided into subunits \n- boygroup\n- known for hardhitting songs, great rap, dance and also vocals and obviously the unlimited member concept\n- units:\n\n nct dream: members under 20 are in this subunit and once youre 20 you \"graduate\" from it, this concepr was demolished though since fans gave a lot of backlash, so now all the orginal members are still in the unit, except 1 (because he graduated before the backlash on the graduation concept i think)\n\nnct u: each comeback they have new members, can be anyone from the currently 23 members\n\nnct 127: 127 stands for the coordinates of seoul (capitol of south korea), they have 10 members (9 active and 1 inactive member due to china -

You cant compare their success. BUT wonde girls are the first group that set their foot in the American Market and I respect them for that.\n\nRegarding Itzy. Weki Meki started the concept and Itzy followed suit. They didnt rip off or copy it. Its just like the girlcrush/cute/sexy concept. Now Weki Meki were the first ones to do so and they deserve respect ok their name. So what if Itzy got inspired? \n\nBecause maybe you dont know weki meki but many companies and most kpop are aware of them, especially since they have Yoojung and Doyeon from I.O.I.

How do you get to decide anything here. Do you know? My great grandmother saw her 9 siblings be murdered in front of her eyes while she was hiding. Then she ran through the woods for kilometers and countries from nazis and wolves. My family got all their property and companies taken away and forcefully written over to non jews. They were shipped over to Kazakhstan and there her parents died right when they arrived. The train they traveled in was infested with sickness and peopel died every day. Dead people thrown out of the train. \n\nJews have always have to live secluded in ghettos for decades. They always had to move when they were told to and belittled by the community. They had to take whichever job they were allowed to work. And antisemitism is a loooong way of being over.\nIn my country its like an unofficial rule, that jewish people cant take government positions and higher up positions. I dont live in third world country btw I live in Europe. In school we get seen as weird. Our TEACHER showed us a clip of jewish culture, for many one of the first clips theyd seen of jewish peoples traditions, and it was a clip belittling jews for their kosher eating habits and making fun of their traditions. Not to compare, but imagine this were a situation about racism or LGBTQ, you all would be running with pitchforks.\n\nI just find it ridiculous. We never complain or cry about our hardships.

(I was around 13-14 then) To be honest, it was the first show that got me hooked. I really felt for the trainees and prayed for their debut. They were so young back then...\nThen after the show they were preparing so diligently for their debut..\nSuddenly yoonbins departurewas announced. Obviously Im not blaming him, he also stated he didnt like the musical direction the group was going in, so that is completely understandable. I think Yoshi still felt heartbroken, that one of his closest friends in ygtb left.. At this time Treasure had fallen silent and us Teume were very frustrated... Where was Treasure?\nIt seemed like everyone had given up on us, with stantwitter ripping Treasure apart ruthlessly, while the fandom fought relentlessly against the hate. Discouraged, criticized and \"the group that wasnt meant to be\". People seemed to have forgotten their hard work, their innocent dreams at such a young age. At that time, we also lost many Teume, since we had a lack of content. Then a glimmer of hope... Pictures of the boys together going out. They were only 144p images, but still. It meant the boys hadnt left YG and something was in the works. Just a short while later the covers started dropping. Next, We got our first TMI. Treasure was back! Surviving off such little content had made the fandom smaller, but evidently stronger, where the fans felt close to eachother. Every week we got spoiled after that with T-Maps, Interviews, V-Lives, etc..Their youtube channel exploded and shot from 200 k to well over a million (rn 1.38 million). Now everyone was joining their fandom left and right. Their reestablished themself, as  a group to be reckoned with! Yedam, a long time trainee also got an opportunity to drop a pre-debut single (not promoted). To Teume, this felt like a meaningful gift to the fans.. The lyrics about endurance and and staying by his side, hit close to home. Sadly BLONKs (only toxic fans, not the whole fandom!!) started to attack Yedam since,  they got little content and his solo dropped before Ros\u00e9s and the other members solos, that were promised since 2018. I can understand where theyre coming from, but firstly dont attack Yedam, since he did nothing wrong, rather critcize the management. Yedam was also a trainee before Ros\u00e9, so that may also be a reasoning (strong connotation on MAY, Im not saying it IS). Thankfully, I think this situation is cooling down, because Blackpink finally released Music (How you like that slaps^^). I am writing this 1 day before their debut. 1 day. It seems incredible, all the stuff we TEUME have gone through. It seems the road is rocky, but theres always a light at the end of the tunnel. At the end of the day, we TEUME have survived, Treasure has survived and they are debuting tomorrow! These words are just enough. \n\nEnding words:\nI am so proud of our achievements, with over 170 k preorders! I also bought both versions on ktown4u and am waiting anxiously for their debut!!\n\nPs. English isnt my first language, German is. Please dont judge!
