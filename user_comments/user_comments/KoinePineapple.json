Here it is on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Athenaze-Book-Introduction-Ancient-Greek/dp/0190607661/ref=sr_1_1?crid=RWGPN77ZTEYH&keywords=athenaze&qid=1660348060&s=books&sprefix=athenaze%2Cstripbooks%2C88&sr=1-1) and [zlibrary](https://b-ok.cc/book/700224/3e55a8). Please note that there is not much difference between Classical Greek and Koine Greek, so either is good to learn, and either can help you read the Bible and other early Christian literature.\n\nThere is also the sub r/AncientGreek if you have questions.

He asks for the foreskins (instead of say, their heads) because of the symbolic value. Philistines have foreskins, so they do not know God.\n\n**Tim 2:11** \\- There are some ways to see this being a cultural thing or whatever. I don't think it jives with how women are normally treated in the NT, so I think there is certainly some context that we are missing. But other than that, I have no explanation.\n\n**Hosea 13:16** \\- I don't know how to explain this. Sometimes there are parts of the Bible that we may simply be uncomfortable with. This verse is sadly a part that has not transcended its historical context. ~~I reread this and it actually feels like the Deuteronomy one. Bad things will happen to Israel when God doesn't have their back.~~\n\n**Isaiah 13:9\u201316** \\- The main message is that the Babylonians will be powerless to protect the things they value most (children, wives, and homes). However, while this is a brutal description of a vision, this not a command to do these things.\n\n**Psalm 137:8** \\- This is a tragic song sung by the Hebrews when they were taken captive by Babylon. It depicts the Babylonians tormenting the Hebrews by telling them to sing about their homeland. Instead they sing a curse against their captors. You can really feel the vile anger dripping out of each verse. While this is a brutal psalm, I don't actually see how it's problematic.\n\n**Deuteronomy 28:53** \\- Once read, this is clearly not God condoning cannibalism. This whole section is about what would happen to Israel if ~~God removed his protection from them~~ they go against God's covenant.  In these few verses, he is saying how he will curse Israel so that enemies will siege them. And often when sieged, people become so starved that they eat each other. It is ghastly, and is genuinely difficult to wrestle with.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOverall, most of these are poor attempts to put forward something problematic. Only the ones from Timothy, Hosea, and Deuteronomy ones are legitimately difficult to wrestle with. The rest are taken out of context.\n\nIf you want to look further into these verses, a good commentary or annotated Bible would work. I like the Oxford one, and Robert's Altar's Hebrew Bible.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Even I fall into the trap of wording things to make them softer.

But you're saying that he is referring to Jesus as Lord, then God as Lord, separately but in adjacent sentences? Claiming that it should have the divine name here because the Septuagint contained it is dubious at best. Only 5 fragments of the Septuagint contain the divine name, but that's not even a majority of our fragments from just the 1st century.\n\nThere are other places that Paul quotes the OT, but uses to the language to apply it to Jesus, such as in 1 Cor 1:31 and 1 Cor 10:26.\n\nHort? He is respected in the field, but even his most recent work is 130 years old. Also I cannot find the commentary you mention. If it is inaccessible, how can I check this?\n\nUnderstand that I am not advocating for the trinity. I am only saying that the debate on the trinity is not clear cut or obvious. Both sides have some good reasons for believing what they do. However, I AM claiming that Paul probably believed in the trinity.\n\nAlso you quoted only part of Romans 1:22-23. Let me post the complete passage:\n\n>*Romans 1:22 ESV Claiming to be wise, they became fools, 23 and exchanged the glory of the immortal God for images resembling mortal man* ***and birds and animals and creeping things.***\n\nYou quoted this but left out the second half of the sentence that makes it clear that Paul is talking about idol worship. Do you not consider this cherry-picking?\n\n**4)**\n\nBelieving in the trinity and translating John 1:1 \"a God\" are not exclusive. I believe that \"the Word was God\" is the proper translation, but I'm on the fence about the trinity. John L. McKenzie does suggest something closer to your translation, though he is a trinitarian. However, his translation is a lot more nuanced than you suggest, but I can't copy/paste it because I was looking at it on archive.org. But it does give me a lot to think about since McKenzie is widely known, so I respect his opinion on the translation quite a lot compared to someone like BeDuhn.\n\nBut I don't believe that the academic community rejects scholars on the basis of whether they argue the trinity or not. BeDuhn's views would have definitely been questioned even if he vouched for the trinity because that's how academics work. If you can give anything approaching proof that they do what you claim, then that would go a long way. In either case isn't it also bad to say that only the non-trinitarians are the one's who are being honest, but that all the trinitarian scholars are only doing so out of peer pressure and tradition?\n\nYou're misquoting Julius Mantey. He wrote a letter expressing how is upset that Watchtower misapplied his work to justify the NWT translation of John 1:1. You can find the text of the letter [here](https://mmoutreachinc.com/jehovahs_witnesses/dr_mantey_lt.html), or just google for it.\n\n**5)**\n\nIf understanding the word 'literal' as meaning a non-dynamic translation, then the NWT is absolutely not literal. But I think you could call it a word-for-word translation, because even when it replaces a word with a phrase, it does so consistently.\n\nDuthie was not a scholar. As far as I can tell, he produced no critical scholarly work. His only relevant works are his books that review Bible translations.\n\nI disagree with BeDuhn's analysis of other translations. He suggests that other translators are just all about the trinity. In my opinion, the trinity is actually pretty subtle in most major translations, and not at all in-your-face like he suggests.", "created_utc": "1658275440.0", "edited": "1658297465.0", "id": "igumvox", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_w1vth8", "parent_id": "t1_igskqni", "score": "1", "subreddit": "Christianity", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh6c"}, {"author": "KoinePineapple", "body": "**1)**\n\nThat footnote is cryptic, and I'm not sure how to came to your conclusion about what it actually means. It \"*signifies predication rather than identification.*\"? Predicates nominatives themselves either identify or qualify. If it means that it is a predicate of qualification, why wouldn't the footnote say it that way? So I don't know what this footnote is trying to say, and after looking in every Greek grammar I can find, I still have no insight into this.\n\nColossians 1:15 uses the term \"**\u03c0\u03c1\u03c9\u03c4\u03cc\u03c4\u03bf\u03ba\u03bf\u03c2**\". Modern scholarship determined that while this literally means \"first-born\" (and can be used this way), it is also commonly used expressively as a person with special status equivalent to first-born. Other early Christian literature backs this up when Polycarp calls the heretic Marcion the \"first-born of Satan\". He was not literally the first, but has status of the first.\n\nRevelation 3:14 says that Jesus is the beginning of creation as in the cause of creation, not the first product of it.\n\nThere definitions are backed up by modern scholarship, and you can confirm them by looking up the entries for **\u03c0\u03c1\u03c9\u03c4\u03cc\u03c4\u03bf\u03ba\u03bf\u03c2** and **\u1f00\u03c1\u03ba\u03ae** in the BDAG lexicon like I just did.\n\nI disagree with your interpretation of \"In the beginning\" in John 1:1 and at the very least, the early church seems to back up a trinitarian reading, judging from the verses in Colossians and Revelation, when correctly exegeted.\n\n**2)**\n\nI'm sorry, I don't know Coptic and have never studied it. It looks like people go both ways on this issue. Scholarship tends to go the route that the Coptic indefinite can still be translated as definite depending on context. But Coptic blogs tend to disagree. If you know Coptic, you'll be able to say that the indefinite article means the same as English, otherwise I don't think you could say that with certainty, especially because none of the Coptic grammars I found go into a lot of detail about this.\n\nIn this case, Watchtower is guilty of cherry-picking. The only way you could find such a quote in that encyclopedia is by using a version that is over 50 years old. The most recent version is from 2002, and in volume XIV on page 189 it reads:\n\n>*Among the Apostolic Fathers,\r CLEMENT OF ROME, for instance, writing to the Church of\r Corinth in the final decade of the 1st century, bears witness to God the Father, to the Son, to the Spirit, and mentions all three together (ch. 58, ch. 46).*\n\nThe rest of the entry on the trinity goes on to say how several other ante-nicene fathers also expressed acknowledgement of the trinity.\n\nEven the other the book, ***The Church of the First Three Centuries***, is from 1860. Perhaps Watchtower was unable to find quotes from recent literature?", "created_utc": "1658264782.0", "edited": "False", "id": "igtx222", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_w1vth8", "parent_id": "t1_igsj1uu", "score": "1", "subreddit": "Christianity", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh6c"}, {"author": "KoinePineapple", "body": "I remember that group from a few years ago!

Not always, but often. The only other clue to go off of is the context. John 1:1 starts with saying \"In the beginning was the Word...\", which alludes to Genesis 1's \"In the beginning God...\". Just that sentence alone equates the Word to God, so it doesn't seem excessive to translate \"**\u03b8\u03b5\u1f78\u03c2 \u1f26\u03bd \u1f41 \u03bb\u03cc\u03b3\u03bf\u03c2**\" as \"the Word was God, because the context indicated it at the start of John 1:1.\n\n**2)**\n\nI know Coptic has both. But since the Greek definite article is used in different ways from the English article, it's reasonable to think that the Coptic articles are also different from English. I'm not sure, but I suspect this is the case since at least some of the Church Fathers from Egypt (like Clement of Alexandria) have explicitly trinitarian views, though they may have been familiar with the Coptic versions.\n\n**3)**\n\nThough translation is more complicated than most people think, it is tough to defend an inclusion that is not at all necessary to understanding the text. In ambiguous cases, who is to say whether 'Lord' refers to Jehovah or to Jesus, so it is wrong to use 'Jehovah' where it is unclear. Yet there are places where the NWT takes liberties with unambiguous uses of 'Lord'. Take Romans 10:9-13 for example:\n\n> ^(9) that if you confess with your mouth Jesus as Lord, and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead, you will be saved; ^(10) for with the heart a person believes, resulting in righteousness, and with the mouth he confesses, resulting in salvation. ^(11) For the Scripture says, \u201cWhoever believes in Him will not be put to shame.\u201d ^(12) For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek; for the same Lord is Lord of all, abounding in riches for all who call on Him; ^(13) for \u201cEveryone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.\u201d\n\nI used the ESV text to show that 'Lord' is used in verse 13. For all the prior verses it has been shows that 'Lord' refers to Jesus. Yet the NWT uses 'Jehovah' for verse 13 because it is a quote from Joel. This passage equates Jesus with God by using the same title 'Lord' to refer to each one very close together in the text, so replacing 'Lord' with 'Jehovah' significantly changes the meaning.\n\n**4)**\n\nJust because scholars defend the trinity does not mean that they do so only out of traditions and beliefs that they already had. To suggest so is to suggest that the scholars who follow the consensus lack the academic integrity to honestly question the trinity. When scholars support the NWT, they don't get discredited only because of that, but because they lack good enough arguments to convince the academic community, or because of other extreme views. In the case of BeDuhn, I would say he held other fringe views. For example, in his book, **The First New Testament**, he promotes the concept of Marcionite priority.\n\n**5)**\n\nI understand your reasoning for these translations. Though I still don't agree with them, I think they are solid points about your philosophy of translation. In my personal view, I think one should translate as literally as possible, then educate the reader on difficult parts. It sounds like you believe in clarifying the meaning within the text itself. I suppose there's nothing inherently wrong with that. It does rub me the wrong way, but I don't think I could necessarily express why that is.", "created_utc": "1658194409.0", "edited": "False", "id": "igpz1ga", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_w1vth8", "parent_id": "t1_igpfe2z", "score": "1", "subreddit": "Christianity", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh6c"}, {"author": "KoinePineapple", "body": "Thank you for debating with me. I'm gonna number my arguments so it's easier to follow, since these are getting kind of long.\n\n**1)** I think the problem arises with translating Greek because they teach new students that an absence of the article means the noun is indefinite. But this is only partly true. Such a case can be seen in John 1:6 where the NWT says\n\n>\"*There came a man who was sent as a representative of God; his name was John.*\"\n\nThe word 'God' here does not have the article in Greek, but is still translated as referring to Jehovah. Why was this same logic not also applied to John 1:1? So I disagree with the NWT's version of John 1:1, because it adds in assumptions that don't appear in the Greek text.\n\n**2)** I'm sorry that I can't argue about the Coptic text. I don't know Coptic (though I'd like to learn :D ). But I am aware that it has an indefinite article. But, like with the Greek definite article, it may not mean exactly the same thing as the English articles.\n\n**3)** When it comes to using the word 'Jehovah' in the New Testament, I have trouble understanding why someone wouldn't think of this as an added word. it simply isn't in the text. According to BeDuhn, It is even added it in some places where there is ambiguity about the word 'Lord' that it replaced.\n\n**4)** I started reading BeDuhn's book when you mentioned it in your other comment. I've been through several chapters already, and I don't think I've misrepresented his work, but I could be wrong. It's true that he thinks very highly of the NWT, but is still honest about his problems with it. But his opinions do not match Biblical scholarship. It's possible to find scholars who support the NWT, but a large majority agree that it is heavily biased, and that seems to be the consensus. I feel that jw.org misrepresents the amount of support that the NWT has in the scholarly community.\n\n**5)** 'Jehovah' is not the only word that changed. In the verse I mentioned earlier, John 1:6, the term 'representative' does not appear in the Greek at all, and was added in the NWT. One could argue that it doesn't change the meaning, but it would still be an inaccuracy. And there's the classic example of Colossians 1:16:\n\n>*because by means of him all* ***other*** *things were created in the heavens and on the earth, the things visible and the things invisible, whether they are thrones or lordships or governments or authorities. All* ***other*** *things have been created through him and for him.*\n\nI have bolded the word 'other'. It does not appear in the Greek, and changes the meaning of the text significantly. I believe that this is an anti-trinitarian addition.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe fact is that the NWT is not a perfect or better translation than any other. It's my opinion that it is very flawed, but still is valuable for reading.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAgain, thank you for bringing your points to my attention.

He hypothesized that these could have evolved via lobe-finned fish when fish evolved to amphibians. 390 million years ago, the only vertebrates were fish. But 360 million years ago, there were clearly tetrapods that could walk on land. So Shubin guessed that if a lobe-finned transitional species existed, it would have lived in shallow fresh water from somewhere in the middle, around 375 million years ago. So he found a spot in the Canadian Artic that would have had shallow fresh water at that time and started digging in 1999. After 5 years he found a fossil that was the bony, lobe-finned fish that he predicted. It was unmistakably a fish, but had distinctly amphibian qualities like bonier appendages, a flat head with eyes and nostrils on top, and the existence of a neck. The new species was named Tiktaalik Roseae.\n\nWhat convinced me of evolution was not just the transitional species itself, but the fact that Shubin predicted where he would expect to find this fossil, then found it there!
