Was a bit unsure how much value bloom would be to me since I've found my Ayaka freeze or Kokomi/Qiqi taser teams to be pretty solid for dealing with most multi-target chambers on floor 12. Fighting those purple and red samurai really sold me on Nilou though. Unlike freeze or taser where you need to be tracking the health of both and switching targets somewhat regularly, bloom just burns down everything equally so it's just a matter of keeping things grouped up. Those two normally force me to replay a chamber a few times till I get it right but this time I didn't find them an issue at all. Freeze and taser would definitely be better for high damage situations, or for dealing with things like corrosion, but bloom definitely has areas where it excels over other comps. \n\nBeyond that, while Dendro traveler and Collei are a little bit on the janky side I personally didn't find them that bad to use. The biggest issue at the moment is that any enemies outside of their dendro rings tend to survive the main aoe blasts and are a bit of a pain to pick off individually due to everyone being low damage individually. Collei's short skill CD+Kokomi's AA for hydro application tends to be enough to deal with stragglers but it's still not ideal.

In the Indian tradition, yakshas have a dual nature, both light and dark, either acting as local nature deities or dangerous, demon-like spirits who can be deadly to humans with whom they cross paths. Ancient Indian depictions of yaksha vary from [human forms](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/ba/Didarganj_Yakshi_statue_in_the_Bihar_Museum.jpg/800px-Didarganj_Yakshi_statue_in_the_Bihar_Museum.jpg) to squat, dwarf-like beings(https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/original/DP-18263-001.jpg) >!(nobody make a Xiao height joke)!<, reflecting the diversity of their potential natures. Within the Buddhist tradition, through which yaksha mythology passed into China, yaksha became intertwined with Buddhist notions of karmic debt, often being portrayed as [vicious demons or ogres](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ac/Statue_of_Yaksha_supporting_one_of_the_Two_Golden_Chedi_of_Wat_Phra_Kaew%2C_Bangkok%2C_Thailand.jpg) who have been reborn into these forms due to sins committed in their past lives. While in many stories Yaksha are portrayed as malevolent entities, notions of salvation are also closely tied to their mythology, with many yaksha being [converted to Buddhism](https://www.buddhanet.net/e-learning/buddhism/bt_5.htm) whereupon they use their powers to serve as guardians of the innocent. For this reason many Buddhist temples, especially in South East Asia, feature [yaksha guardians](https://www.worldhistory.org/uploads/images/12273.jpg) defending their main gates.  \n\nXiao\u2019s past sins, his defeat and redemption by Zhongli and conversion into a defender of the people of Liyue lines up quite closely with many traditional Buddhist portrayals of yaksha. Like these traditional yaksha, Xiao is burdened by the sins of his past while at the same embarking upon a path to salvation. Beyond this other parallels include [Xiao\u2019s mask](https://www.pcgamesn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/genshin-impact-xiao-build-best-1-1.jpg) resembling the [tusk-toothed depiction](https://thumbs.dreamstime.com/b/yaksha-thotsakan-wat-phra-kaew-bangkok-thailand-129677120.jpg) common for yaksha faces while the role Zhongli plays for him and the other yaksha is similar to that of [*Vai\u015brava\u1e47a*](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/7d/0d/f5/7d0df548698a2adee91ec623b07d1239.jpg), a righteous deity who guards the places where the Buddha teaches and to whom the yaksha act as attendants. Finally, Xiao\u2019s name (\u9b48), meaning a \u201cmountain spirit\u201d, reflects the connections to natural and desolate places that are common in yaksha stories. \n\nWhile Xiao isn\u2019t one of my favourite characters, researching more about yaksha and seeing how these myths have influenced his design has definitely made me appreciate him quite a bit more. Anyway, hope this was informative and, as always, any additional information or corrections are appreciated. \n\nPrevious posts for those interested: \n\n[Yanfei](https://www.reddit.com/r/Genshin_Impact_Leaks/comments/xha2et/a_dendro_core_a_day_keeps_il_dottore_away_general/ipld01f/)\n\n[Qiqi](https://www.reddit.com/r/Genshin_Impact_Leaks/comments/xha2et/a_dendro_core_a_day_keeps_il_dottore_away_general/ipboiyj/)", "created_utc": "1664287045.0", "edited": "False", "id": "iq3rnfu", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_xo1vmg", "parent_id": "t3_xo1vmg", "score": "39", "subreddit": "Genshin_Impact_Leaks", "subreddit_id": "t5_3l2acu"}, {"author": "meirenzaizhe", "body": "In Chinese to say \"tired\" you can say \u7d2f\u4e86 (L\u00e8ile), this is pronounced similarly to the name Layla.

Xiezhi, sometimes lumped together with qilin as \u201cChinese Unicorns\u201d, often vary in depiction ranging from [lion-like representations](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/73/Xiezhi1.jpg/640px-Xiezhi1.jpg) to something *slightly* more akin to a [scaly horned deer](https://virmuze-bucket.s3.amazonaws.com/gallery_slideshow0/exhibit_gallery_image/2020/11/30/9ef752c_exhibit_gallery_image.jpg). In Chinese mythology, xiezhi possess the power to divine the guilt or innocence of an individual, often punishing the guilty by stabbing them with their horn, and are thus closely connected to the legal profession. According to one of the earliest legends to mention xiezhi, the legal minister for the legendary Emperor Shun [employed one such beast for use during criminal trials](https://books.google.ca/books?id=AWVXEAAAQBAJ&pg=PA135&lpg=PA135&dq=gaoyao+xiezhi&source=bl&ots=7ZQyni_fZc&sig=ACfU3U3Rba9E8hFeSOppMk7KEzWHREtUXw&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjx0I6mxab6AhU-IDQIHYJ9CRYQ6AF6BAgeEAM#v=onepage&q=gaoyao%20xiezhi&f=false). As just and upright creatures, xiezhi could be counted on to dispense justice even to those in positions of power and privilege, making them a symbol of impartiality and fairness. Overtime, the symbolism surrounding xiezhi became deeply embedded in the Chinese legal profession. The [*faguan* (\u6cd5\u51a0), or \u201clegal hat\u201d](https://pic.baike.soso.com/ugc/baikepic2/0/20160718074853-465729431.jpg/1284), worn by law enforcement officials during the Qin and Han dynasties was often called a \u201cxiezhi hat\u201d and various legal officials also came to be referred to as such. While less well known than other Chinese mythical beasts, the association between xiezhi and justice/law enforcement remains present in the modern Chinese speaking world, for example an image of a xiezhi appears on the [badge](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e8/Insignia_of_ROCMP.jpg/1024px-Insignia_of_ROCMP.jpg) of the Republic of China (Taiwan) military police.\n\nYanfei\u2019s design and personality draws very directly from the imagery and mythology of xiezhi. Her horns and scales both derive from common depictions of the creature and her hat closely resembles the *faguan* of ancient Chinese justice officials. Her constellation *Beastia Iusitia* (\u6cd5\u7378\u5ea7) translates to \u201cbeast of law\u201d and her upright personality and personal commitment to truth and justice likewise line up exactly with the virtues xiezhi are said to possess. All in all, she\u2019s pretty much exactly what you\u2019d expect from a half-xiezhi running around Liyue >!(maybe minus the explosions though, couldn\u2019t find anything about xiezhi making stuff go *boom* but there\u2019s nothing wrong with a little artistic license here and there)!<.\n\nHope this was informative and if anyone has anything to add or correct please do let me know. I may do a few more of these on some of the other Liyue and maybe Inazuma characters when I have the time and if people here find it useful. \n\n[Qiqi](https://www.reddit.com/r/Genshin_Impact_Leaks/comments/xha2et/a_dendro_core_a_day_keeps_il_dottore_away_general/ipboiyj/) one for anyone interested.", "created_utc": "1663938747.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ipld01f", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_xha2et", "parent_id": "t3_xha2et", "score": "70", "subreddit": "Genshin_Impact_Leaks", "subreddit_id": "t5_3l2acu"}, {"author": "meirenzaizhe", "body": "Thanks!

Chinese differentiates between two kinds of reanimated corpses, the Western style, brain-eating \u55aa\u5c4d (sangshi) and the traditional Chinese \u6bad\u5c4d (jiangshi), to which Qiqi belongs. The mythology of jiangshi, which literally means \u201cstiff corpse\u201d, can be traced back to the Qing Dynasty and most likely came from the traditional practice of transporting corpses back to their ancestral village for burial. Many Jiangshi myths involve Daoist priests being paid to [reanimate and transport corpses](https://p26.toutiaoimg.com/large/pgc-image/f026837277b446f6abeb302efed8f20f) as this would be cheaper than hiring a vehicle. The Daoist priest would raise the corpse and attach a [fulu or fuzhou talisman (\u7b26\u7c59/\u7b26\u5492)](https://5b0988e595225.cdn.sohucs.com/images/20171021/ea51ca13ec50444dad3f1311f6b6c686.jpeg) to the jiangshi\u2019s head to stop them from being able to move about independently outside of his orders (and potentially go berserk). Somewhat similar to western zombies, Jiangshi are quite stiff in their movements, though rather than lurching about they normally are depicted [hopping with their arms stretched forward to maintain balance](https://youtu.be/jNoUEPeppZ4?t=71), for this reason they are sometimes referred to as \u201chopping zombies\u201d. Their appearance can vary between that of rotting corpses or something close to a fully living human and they are normally depicted in the attire of a [Qing court official](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/29/Qing_Dynasty_Mandarin.jpg/220px-Qing_Dynasty_Mandarin.jpg), which may have reflected anti-Manchu - the ethnic group that made up the Qing elite - sentiments among the broader Han Chinese population. \n\nQiqi as a character both conforms with and breaks from many common jiangshi tropes. Her style of dress, including her [Manchu style queue braid](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/40/Chinese_Meal_by_Lai_Afong%2C_c1880.JPG) are reflective of how jiangshi are normally attired. Her regular calisthenics exercises allow her to offset the rigamortis common among jiangshi, while the fact that she essentially raised herself from the dead accounts for her self-will. Unlike most jiangshi, Qiqi fills the dual role of both animated corpse and animator of corpse, which is why she is forced to give herself orders to be able to undertake most activities and also why she isn\u2019t too keen on removing the talismans from her body as this could negatively impact her self-control. Finally, perhaps the biggest difference is that Qiqi is much more adorable than the average jiangshi, which sometimes results in misunderstandings, such as >!when groups of treasure hoarders try to threaten her and end up getting their asses handed to them by a pintsized walking corpse.!<\n\n>!Disclaimer: I am not a jiangshi expert so if anyone has anything to add or correct please do let me know!<", "created_utc": "1663764446.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ipboiyj", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_xha2et", "parent_id": "t3_xha2et", "score": "100", "subreddit": "Genshin_Impact_Leaks", "subreddit_id": "t5_3l2acu"}, {"author": "meirenzaizhe", "body": "From what we know about Fontaine it would probably fit the whole steampunk aesthetic so that would be a plus.", "created_utc": "1663763038.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ipblo54", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_xha2et", "parent_id": "t1_ipbldps", "score": "5", "subreddit": "Genshin_Impact_Leaks", "subreddit_id": "t5_3l2acu"}, {"author": "meirenzaizhe", "body": "Yeah, I think it >!stays in the green house in cube form during the day time and then wanders around at night!<", "created_utc": "1663762269.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ipbk6ee", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_xha2et", "parent_id": "t1_ipbjxqh", "score": "15", "subreddit": "Genshin_Impact_Leaks", "subreddit_id": "t5_3l2acu"}, {"author": "meirenzaizhe", "body": "No, they don't even seem to work that well together.

There devotees can work to achieve enlightenment in essentially ideal conditions, free from the sufferings and temptations of the mortal realm.
