I realized that a lot of that I could have done myself but during my lesson with her the real value was all the online resources that she shared.  She had taught over 2000+ lessons and she pretty much listed out the best, free online resources to learn Japanese.  After getting these resources, I stopped taking lessons with her and then focused on using these resoruces that she introduced to me.\n\nI actually would book a new italki teacher here and there just to \"check-in\" to see how much my langauge skills were improving.  Each time I found that I still had a long ways to go but it was nice to feel the little improvement.. that was motivating in itself which allowed me to continue to study.  It's usually about $10=$15 per hour lesson and I'd do one every 3 weeks or so.  The one thing I got really, really good at was introducing myself.

When you are deeply committed to learning a new language, you naturally will get into the culture - especially as you reach the B1 and B2 level.

Time and exposure gives your tutor a chance to get to know you and your particular interests/weaknesses... I mean, the more comfortable you are with someone, the easier everything gets.\n\nMy Spanish tutor actively sends me messages throughout the week - just small recommendations. *Saw this channel, thought you might like it.* or *This came up in the news -- have you heard of Poetry in Action?* etc. You can't really get that when somebody only has a surface-level view of you, and it takes time to develop.\n\nIf you *really* want to work with a ton of tutors, be proactive in the topics of conversation. *Hey, you majored in music education? How'd you feel about giving me a crash course in Music Theory 101 in \\[language\\]?* or *Yo! You love cooking? I bake! What do you think of the food in \\[their country\\] v \\[other country\\]*.... pick tutors that can talk about a specific thing so that you avoid having tons of generic lessons.\n\n**What you're actually doing in the lessons**\n\nThe biggest advantage and disadvantage of iTalki lessons is that whatever happens is totally up to you.\n\nIf you're comfortable putting syllabi together and planning your own learning, and are honest about what you do and don't know, cool! You can get super useful and individualized lessons from anywhere in the world, at any time, across many price points.\n\nIf you aren't going into the lessons with a plan, it's also *really* easy to get no benefit from your time/money. Most tutors on iTalki *are not* language teachers; they're just people who speak the language. They can't necessarily guide you in any way. I don't speak Mandarin very well, but I know more about Mandarin linguistics than my tutor does. That's okay because I can give him clear examples of what I want to work on, and he's super creative and personable so he spins something together that normally answers my questions. But if I didn't have experience as a teacher myself, I don't know how much I'd get from studying with this particular guy.\n\nThere *is* a special period in the beginning/after beginning to talk for the first time where it doesn't really matter what you do because it takes some time to get used to talking in another language, but beyond that, what you can take from superficial conversations gets pretty limited.\n\nWhatever you do, and whatever your level is, it's really important that you're loosely following *something* so that you can keep track of the progress you're making.\n\n**The tutor's style**\n\nWhat you'll definitely figure out with 10 tutors is that there are lots of different types of tutors; some better or worse for you and your goals. Some tutors will let basically anything slide so long as the conversation is moving along, others will stop you at each little mistake. Some take sort of a middle ground where they'll note what you said and what you should have said in the chat.\n\nSome just want to chat for the full hour because they aren't comfortable teaching/whatever reason, others will want to have a topic each lesson (whether it's a grammar point or a talking point) because they aren't as outgoing and don't feel comfortable making random small-talk with a stranger for an hour.\n\nSome will talk to you pretty naturally, most will slightly slow down their speech and speak quite slowly while simplifying their language/cutting out all but the most direct language, others have a lot of experience talking with beginners and can talk for hours about any subject using only 1,000 words.\n\nAll of those things can be good or bad depending on what your goals are. *Again*, it's important to know what you want, watch the tutor's intro video and decide if their style will help you achieve your goals.\n\n**TL;DR - Talking can be great, but it isn't a magical remedy / you won't just come out after 100 hours of iTalki being perfect. The output that you're able to create depends on the quality of the input you're getting. When you practice output, you get more comfortable doing stuff you already know how to do. If you aren't getting any input (stuff happening outside of the lessons... media/books/textbooks/whatever) then you'll never/very slowly add to your stack of \"stuff I know exists\" and \"stuff I know exists that I more or less know how to do\".**\n\n**If you don't get any input, you'll improve till you reach a sort of low-intermediate level in which you've got enough words to describe most things (not** ***dumpster*** **but** ***the place where you put trash***\\*\\*) and enough grammar to express many ideas using those words (but in a stilted fashion and not very efficiently). That's a cool point to reach, but you definitely want to go beyond that point, and I don't think you can go beyond that point with\\*\\* ***only*** **random iTalki lessons.**", "created_utc": "1591953878.0", "edited": "False", "id": "fuky5zi", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_h7c7k2", "parent_id": "t1_fuky4fz", "score": "1", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "LupatJones", "body": "Your question sparked an epic post about italki tutors.

What your level in the language is\n2. The preparation/homework you're doing outside of class\n3. Your relationship with the tutor\n4. What you're actually doing in the lessons\n5. The tutor's style\n\n**What your level in the language is**\n\n* If you're a beginner, this can be great to learn the ropes of grammar. The problem is that you'll very quickly run out of stuff that you can (ie, that you're grammatically able to) talk about. In order to fill that time, you'll either (a) have tons of repetitive conversations that will get boring quickly or (b) start guessing at grammar to convey your points (not necessarily bad, creativity is an important skill, but if you latch onto any incorrect patterns, that'd be annoying later on)\n* If you're an intermediate learner, I think this would be great! As an intermediate learner you've got enough grammar to say basically anything *but* you're not super confident about how to use it / structuring your ideas / etc. You know enough that you're able to work through any discussion, not enough to confidently do so. This means that your potential areas of study are basically anything, there's lots of growth.\n* If you're an advanced learner, I don't think this many hours will be useful. Once you hit a certain point in proficiency, one that's not even especially high, you start taking less and less from an hour of conversation. You have enough strong points that you can make anything work while avoiding your weak points. IMO if you're at this level, I'd prefer to spend 60-90 minutes per day with a knowledgeable tutor that is comfortable identifying and fixing mistakes. Take the money you're planning to spend, reduce the quantity of lessons in order to afford better quality tutors (a high price doesn't mean they're great, pay attention to their video/page/reviews).\n\n**Preparation / homework outside of class**\n\n* As a beginner, you just don't have a lot to work with. You don't know anything. The good news is that means that there's tons of low-hanging fruit. You should be independently studying/preparing so that you can **bring something new to practice in every single class.. and that's a lot of work on your part.** Tutor lessons support and reinforce whatever it is you're doing, and if you're doing nothing... there's nothing to support.\n* As an intermediate learner, I again feel you have more leeway. IMO intermediate means you know a lot of stuff, but it's not reliable or automatic yet. This is the sweet spot where you can work with pretty much anybody. Ideally your tutor will tell you \"Hey, you made mistake A B C often... here's some stuff you can review with\" and you get homework. More revision than preparation.\n* As an advanced learner, lessons need to be working towards a concrete goal. They've already learned a lot and don't make many obvious mistakes, so you've got to find them. My advanced students *always* come with a small essay, presentation, some sort of pronunciation, etc. They know enough that they're mostly leading themselves, I'm just telling them how they're doing and helping them identify what's holding things up. At this level you've really got to help your tutor help you.\n\n**Your relationship with the tutor**\n\nIn my experience as both a student and tutor, no matter what the student says they want to learn, the first lesson always looks almost identical.\n\n1. Ice-breaking and getting to know eachother\n2. The student talks about how they think their level is and what they think their problems are\n3. The tutor is assessing how much the student actually knows and deciding whether they agree with the students assessment\n4. You plan what you're actually going to work on from now on\n5. If a concrete plan wasn't decided on, you basically trudge through everyday conversations, slowly working through the main topics, over following lessons\n\nThis has been true even for my advanced students who come in for specific issues like accent reduction or preparing a presentation for work.", "created_utc": "1591953835.0", "edited": "False", "id": "fuky4fz", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_h7c7k2", "parent_id": "t1_fukxn2n", "score": "1", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "LupatJones", "body": "I actually use italki and love the service because of the flexibility.

People are so enamored by FREE, FREE, FREE but usually when you seek free resources or free language partners, you are really sacrificing TIME.  A really good example is paying for an italki Tutor vs. getting a FREE language partner.   I used to think - why would I ever pay for a language tutor when there are so many people online where I could do a free language exchange with.  And when I was first learning Vietnamese I'd find all these language partners to chat with.  All in all it was a great experience and met some great partners but I realized that I was really wasting my time.  Some of my partners would cancel on me last minute.  We had to coordinate a good time so it'd be back and forth messaging.  When the time came for our actual language chats, they would be surface conversations and that would be that.  End of the day, I was like... ok I can accept all this because it's free... but what I didn't realize was that I was really spending a lot of time and exchanging my time.\n\nThen one day, I tried out italki as everyone was talking about how great it was.  At first I was like... man, I would NEVER pay that amount of money.  I can get that for FREE by exchanging languages with another language exchange partner.  But out of sheer curiosity (and because this one teacher had a trial lesson for like $3), I was like - OK, let me at least try it out to see what all this hype is about so I scheduled a lesson.  That really changed everything and I realized that getting **someone who is focused and zoned in to help you with learning your target language because you are paying them is so much better** than with a free language exchange partner where you're splitting your time.  In my language exchanges, we'd talk and my partners would correct my mistakes - but because they didn't really have teaching experience, they didn't really know how to teach, our sessions would be 30 minutes because they would want English practice on my side.  But with an paid online tutor, I was getting someone who was really, really focused on me and my needs... they weren't waiting for the lesson to end so that they could practice their English.  \n\nI'd have a whole hour and then at the end of the lesson I'd also have a lot of written down notes and words (from the Teacher) that I'd review. Also because online tutors taught so many students from different levels and backgrounds, they just had experience teaching and explaining things online.\n\nI've become a true believer in online language teachers - found a lot of great Vietnamese teachers and over the course of 2 years became conversationally fluent in Vietanamese - largely in part just through paid italki Tutors.\n\nNow I decided to learn Japanese and 7 months in, I have a teacher who has been with me pretty much since the start of my journey.  In fact, I just had my lesson with him now and realize that I would never get this quality and this attention with a free language exchange.  I could probably figure out what he taught me by myself too but it would be hours and hours of discovering and self-learning. My Japanese teacher keeps a running Google Doc of everything we've learned and uses this as the main teaching tool to write down and explain concepts we're learning (especially grammar).  I look forward to our lessons because he's prepared and he knows the level that I'm picks topics and areas that he knows that are the next step in my learning with him.\n\nLastly, because I'm paying for these lessons, I take them so much more seriously.  I'll review what we've learned and I'll work on what he's taught.\n\nThe time I save from having a tutor who is zoned into my learning needs is well worth the money that I pay.

You don't know anything. The good news is that means that there's tons of low-hanging fruit. You should be independently studying/preparing so that you can **bring something new to practice in every single class.. and that's a lot of work on your part.** Tutor lessons support and reinforce whatever it is you're doing, and if you're doing nothing... there's nothing to support.\n\nHis advice for the first lesson:\n\n**Your relationship with the tutor**\n\nIn my experience as both a student and tutor, no matter what the student says they want to learn, the first lesson always looks almost identical.\n\n1. Ice-breaking and getting to know eachother\n2. The student talks about how they think their level is and what they think their problems are\n3. The tutor is assessing how much the student actually knows and deciding whether they agree with the students assessment\n4. You plan what you're actually going to work on from now on\n5.

This is the point where lesson frequency should go down (for most people) and the amount you're spending on a tutor should go up.\n\nSmall talk - and even conversation - doesn't really benefit you. At best you'll pick up a few niche words and phrases... But you don't need a tutor to do that. If you just walk into a lesson with no preparation you'll likely get nothing out of it at all.\n\nIt takes a very knowledgeable person paying attention to identify your personal weak spots and address them.. especially in the midst of a conversation. And it takes a lot of insight.\n\nA beginner student just doesn't know, an intermediate is misapplying a pattern or making a mistake, both of which are obvious fixes and hard to miss. But more advanced students can very comfortably chat for the full hour with only very minor mistakes that don't interrupt the flow of conversation and are entirely overlookable.\n\nEven if the tutor *is* experienced and paying attention, the thing about speaking a language at this high of a level is that you can express the same idea comfortably in a variety of different ways. And we're not Shakespeare, so we're not trying to express every single idea in as complicated a way as possible. A big part of tutoring is the relationship, and since you like the person you're talking to, you want to keep the flow of conversation. Sometimes that means avoiding structures that you struggle with, as you can comfortably express the same idea in another way. But if you don't use the trouble grammar, the tutor can't fix it!\n\nI personally refuse advanced students unless they're specifically interested in my one area of specialization - otherwise they'd just be wasting money.\n\nAt this level, a tutor is IMO an advanced reference resource. You should be consuming a ton and bringing them the especially difficult dialogues, passages, situational exchanges, whatever, you have and getting stuff broken down for you.\n\nLessons once a week, pay for someone with experience in the specific weakness you have.", "created_utc": "1590674118.0", "edited": "False", "id": "fs37pyv", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_grcwt2", "parent_id": "t3_grcwt2", "score": "4", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "LupatJones", "body": "So I just had a Vietnamese lesson with one of my regular Vietnamese Teachers and she mentioned how I looked pretty ragged and I explained that I just got into Tthe NetFlix Japanese Reality TV Show called Terrace House (I'm learning Japanese too) and watched until the wee hours of the morning.

And I really felt that if I switched to another teacher that I was **cheating on my regular teacher**. \n\nThe whole idea of monogamy when it comes to learning on italki is something I think everyone just grows up with.  You naturally have one teacher in school at each grade.  If you take an offline class, you get one teacher that teaches you the entire course.  In college, you sign up for courses and the course is taught by one teacher.\n\nI really feel italki - because of the way it works - you pick a date/time by the hour, changes that and throws these sort of assumptions on how teaching is meant to be out the door.  It kind of flips the whole student-teacher relationship.  It's not Teacher-Centric but Student-Centric Learning.  Students pick the type of teacher they want and like for whatever purpose.  After a while of learning Vietnamese, I started trying out other teachers (and at the beginning I felt I was cheating on my main teacher) but then I started to realize that some of these teachers did a much better job at teaching in different aspects than my main one.  I then figured out a system...  pick and choose different teachers based on different needs and because I like the variety.\n\nI still took lessons with my main teacher - just not as frequently.  But then had:\n\n* One teacher that I used exclusively for pronunciation (Vietnamese tones are so hard).  We'd drill and drill and she was so spot on at figuring out and improving my pronunciation.\n* One teacher that would go out an pick interesting news articles and we'd read these articles together with\n* Several teachers that I'd just have different convesations with because they had expertise in different areas that I like (one was a parent so we'd talk about our kids, one really liked learning other languages)\n* From time to time, I'd pick one of the newer teachers just to practice introducing myself in Vietnamese to someone new who didn't know me. \n\nI never had to explain anything to my main teacher.  He was busy teaching all his other students.  And I realized that the guilt that I had was that I might hurt his feelings.  \n\nI realized later on that to really maximize use of italki... you really should mix up your teachers now and then.

Here's italki's FAQ about italki Credits:\n\n[What are italki Credits?](https://support.italki.com/hc/en-us/articles/360023115873-What-are-italki-Credits-)\n\nJust think of italki Credits = U.S. Dollars as that simplifies everything.  You can pay for lessons individually or just charge up your Student Wallet with italki Credits / U.S. Dollars so you don't need to go through the payment process all over again.  \n\nThere is a slight savings if you buy a bunch of italki Credits at once because you'll save on the \"service fee\" that italki charges you.  It's actually not a service fee but the Credit Card fee that the credit card provider charges any merchants that use their services.  italki uses Stripe for Credit Cards but you can also use Paypal and some others... For example, I take a lot of lessons on italki so I usually just buy $100 worth of italki Credits which essentially means I'm putting USD1000 in my Student Wallet.  When I book lessons with teachers, it's just a much more fluid process as I don't need to make another Credit Card payment, italki simply deducts the cost of the lesson directly from the money (italki Credits) that is inside my wallet.\n\nRegarding discounts, I think what you mean is lesson packages.  These are set by individual teachers (remember italki is just a marketplace and teachers set their own rates, hours and types of lessons).  Some teachers will have a package of 5 lessons or a package of 10 lessons that you can buy at a discounted price.  All that means is you are paying up front for a set # of lessons and because you are paying upfront, you get a discount.  The teacher likes it too because the teacher gets guaranteed lessons that you've already paid for.  You can schedule your lessons in the package at any time within 6 months.  Below is their FAQ:\n\n[Packages](https://support.italki.com/hc/en-us/articles/360022945034-Packages)\n\nFor example, I have a Vietnamese Teacher that charges $8/hour for a normal one-hour Vietnamese Lesson.  She sells a package of 5 lessons for $35/5 lessons which means I'm getting each lesson now for $7 instead of $8 so I save a dollar.  I like it because I'm saving $5 for 5 lessons.  She likes it because she's guaranteed lesson bookings from me.  It's a nice little win-win for both the student and the teacher.  \n\nHope that helps!", "created_utc": "1589109447.0", "edited": "False", "id": "fq5l20x", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_ggzizt", "parent_id": "t3_ggzizt", "score": "2", "subreddit": "iTalki", "subreddit_id": "t5_3cnxj"}, {"author": "LupatJones", "body": "Very nice!

My teacher (Professional Teacher) simply went over a bunch of online materials NHK website and videos .  It was helpful but it was something I felt I could have done myself.  I was repeating after the teacher when most of the words and grammar I still had no grasp of.  Was it helpful... yes, but probably not worth the $29 / hour that the teacher was charging.  If you have the cash, then studying with a teacher for anything is always better as it forces you to show up and learn together.  But a lot of textbook, vocabulary memorization can be done by yourself and probably better done by yourself\n\nOne of the best things about italki is that you can \"test\" the waters whenever you want as you can pay per lesson.  2 months in I tried again with another italki teacher and that made me realize that I was NOT ready for conversation and needed to put more time into self studying to build up my vocabulary and listening skills.\n\nAt 4 months, I felt OK with simple conversation and worked really, really hard to master my \"introduction\" and can now flawlessly introduce myself in Japanese and have that foundation conversation (who are you and let me introduce myself).  \n\nFast forward to now.  I've found a couple great teachers which I started at probably month 4 1/2.  One that does pure conversation and one that sort of creates his own lesson plan.  Both have very different styles and I like the variety.  One simply asks me some questions in Japanese that I have to answer.  If I can't, she gently helps me and gives me the answer and writes it down.  I really like her personality and the fact that she can sort of finish my sentences.  And she'll know when I just don't understand a concept and then break off for a 5-10 minutes to reinforce or teach me something new.  I meet with her once a week and my other teacher once a week.  He shares with me an ongoing Google Doc where he writes down everything we've learned.

I actually went through a few different tutors to finally settle on one that I like the best.  I'm pretty basic (only 4 months in) and spend most of my time self-studying.  italki is pretty varied and this was my experience with the various tutors:\n\n1. I paid for lessons with a Professional Teacher who specialized in Beginners.  She was good and she had a set cirriculum and we went though a lot of screensharing and went through NHK's online lessons together  [https://www.nhk.or.jp/lesson/english/](https://www.nhk.or.jp/lesson/english/)  She was really nice and had tons of experience but I felt like I could have gone through that online material myself and didn't have to shell out almost $30 / hour for a lesson.  \n\n2. I tried out a much cheaper Community Tutor and told her I was a beginner.  Again, very nice (they are all super nice) but she didn't really come with any materials.  She would just come up with some sentences and write them down and we would repeat them.  Pretty basic stuff (I didn't know most of what she taught so I was learning) but it was a bit too informal for me.  I suppose if I were at a A2 or B1 level where I could actually speak, it would have been a lot more worthwhile.  \n\n3. I found a Community Tutor who just keeps a Google Doc and before each class, he'll write down vocab, sample sentences, grammar rules, etc...  We work off the common Google Doc.  He'll have me read a sentence (no romaji) and then explain the \"rules\" and then ask me to create my own sentences and he'll correct and guide me.  I really like his style as he usually comes up with the topics (some of them I've already learned before by self-study) but it's nice because he reinforces stuff and he also teaches me things that I can't get in my self-study.  I've stuck with him for the past 2 months and do a weekly lessons with him.\n\nI probably spend 1 hour a day learning Japanese by myself.  I use Lingodeer, LingQ, Anki and watch YouTube videos.  I tried Genki but I realized that I'm more of a mobile learner - I like learning on my smartphone and have a lot of time on the subway to and from work.  \n\nI like having a real, live tutor because it makes all the self studying I'm doing more real as I'm \"checking in\" with a live person.

These language schools don't really care because they've already gotten your money upfront.  With italki, my teachers have been pretty cool as I've had days where I felt terrible and didn't feel like going but I was able to message them in advance and they let me reschedule for free so I didn't lose my credits.

With Vietnamese, I'm at a high A2 or low B1 level now and I use italki weekly and it's pure conversation practice. I absolutely love our practice sessions as I can talk to my teachers / tutors about pretty much anything. I rotate between 6-8 of them and the fact that we can talk about anything and each has their own opinions and style makes it really fun. I look forward to my sessions with them as it's language learning and a bit of social fun as we talk about anything.\n\nFor Japanese, because this is new and I'm an absolute beginner, it's different. I was a bit hesitant for all the same reasons that you brought up as an absolute beginner. \n\nRegardless, I scheduled a lesson with a Professional Teacher and took her Beginner course just to see what it was like. The lesson was completely different. The teacher had a structured way of teaching (instead of free for all conversation practice because I really can't converse at all yet). But I realized at this stage, this is what I needed. She used a bunch of different websites and multimedia and she was also very good at explaining some basic concepts in a quick and clear way. I suppose that I would have been able to learn these myself too but just having a teacher who has taught so many students just made my Japanese learning at this stage just so much more efficient. I think that's the key... efficiency.\n\nYou can get by doing self study. I'm using LingQ and LingoDeer regularly and review the online lessons that we do in our weekly italki lessons. It nice having that upcoming italki lesson appointment looming over your head to give you that extra pressure to make sure you're getting in as much self study during the week. I want to come prepared for the next lesson.  So for me, I like using it like a checkpoint. \n\nThe other benefit really is just the coaching aspect. In my first lesson, she also gave me some great study tips (and things to look out for as a beginner) and recommended some great free online resources that I've been using since. \n\nSo what I'm saying is my italki experience as an intermediate learner and as a beginning learner is very different. As an intermediate, I really know what I want and that is conversation practice since I have a foundation of vocab to work with and I'm just trying to get more fluent in speaking.\n\nAs a beginner, the benefit of really in the coaching (efficiency) and structured learning. It's more teacher-led at the beginning stage. I just follow her lesson plan and because I'm a beginner, I'm fine with that.  I suppose that once I have more vocab I'll try what I do with Vietnamese and try more conversation practice but at this stage my italki teacher experience is more about Teacher please me and I model everything she does.

But here's what I started with and how I eventually progressed:  \n\n\n1. Learn the foundations.  Alphabet, pronuciation.  I scoured YouTube and I found this channel the best (even though it's Northern Vietnamese) [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCA0ub9oR64O0x1F0PJkt2ZA](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCA0ub9oR64O0x1F0PJkt2ZA)  \n\n2. Memorize Vocab.  There's nothing sexy about this.  Just memorize words.  Spaced repetition apps like Duolingo, Language Drops, Memrise and Anki are all fine.  Just find one (or two) that you enjoy using and can study 5-10 minutes during your \"dead time\" (Commute time, on the toilet, waiting for stuff, in line)  \n\n3. Find a teachern (this costs $ but if you are serious it's worth it as they can really fasttrack your learning as they know all the tips and tricks). I personally use italki as they have a selection of over 40+ Vietnamese teachers all priced pretty reasonably.   [https://www.italki.com/teachers/vietnamese](https://www.italki.com/teachers/vietnamese)  \nNote that there are 2 types of Teachers - Professionals (they have courses and can provide you with materials) and Community Tutors (just native speakers).  If you're beginning and need some structure - just find a Professional Teacher with coursework.  The beauty of italki is you can \"shop around\" - book a few trial lessons and find the teacher you like and then buy a package of lessons as it's cheaper.  Professional lessons will run you about $12-$15/hour which isn't bad considering what you'd pay privately one-on-one face to face (includes travel time and misc costs)  \n\n\nThe hardest thing about learning any language is motivation.  You have a girlfriend and sometimes might run into her relatives so use that as a motivator. Maybe set deadlines (those work too) such as a trip to Vietnam so you want to hit x goal...

Professional Teachers are accredited or have some teaching experience while Community Tutors are basically native speakers.

You need to learn the basics, the alphabet, pronunciation, basic grammar, etc... but once you get to an Intermediate (mid-to-high) - materials are kind of boring.  Instead of using materials just find some native content - new articles about interesting stuff in the language you are learning or watching YouTube videos.    \n\n\nI actually like Conversation Practice because it's real, it's fun (I usually just talk to them about my day or what's happening in my life as if I were talking to a friend).

That's the learning - I copy all the words that my teacher writes down onto my Evernote notebook and review.  I think it's the best way to learn naturally because the words and conversation you are having is now relevant.  So don't knock conversation practice - when it comes down to rentention - conversation practice (when asking the teacher to write down words you don't know or have problems with) is the best form of learning for me.

It's an extremely hard language as it so tonal.  I'll use Glossika (great beginning resource btw) and some simple YouTube videos that focus on Vietnamese learning for active listening. I struggle to try and understand 100% of what is being said and eventually because I'm actively trying to understand, I will.\n\nThen the Passive listening part - when I'm at the gym working out - I choose to listen to Vietnamese music or VOA News in Vietnamese (Stitcher is great).

I'm learning Vietnamese which is an incredibly hard tonal language to master. My accent reduction exercise of choice is reading out loud. I select an article that I usually find online - something that isn't too long or a topic that's interesting. I usually like finding native content on Vietnamese websites like cafebiz.vn.  I'll send this article to my teacher ahead of time before the lesson begins and when I have my lesson with the article as the pronunciation exercise foundation. Usually goes like this:\n\n1. I read the first sentence by myself. (Note: we're using screen sharing mode so we both can see the article)\n2. italki teacher then gives feedback for those words I am mispronouncing. Teacher also writes those down for me.\n3. Teacher then reads the same sentence.\n4. I repeat after the teacher.\n5. Those words that I have trouble with, we really work on. Sometimes doing a listen, repeat, listen, repeat several times. \n\nWe do this until we finish the article. And at the end of the lesson, the teacher will have written down all the words I have trouble pronouncing so I can work on them later.\n\nI find the above method works great as you use real native content and the teacher gets to hear how you would \"naturally\" speak it and gives you immediate feedback during the lesson itself.\n\nWhat's really key is for some words that are just hard to pronounce, just switch into video mode (from screen share) and ask the teacher to speak closely into the camera so you can observe there teacher's mouth moments in detail. For Vietnamese, because it's a tonal language, this is really key. Actually seeing (and having the teacher explain) how a native speaker contorts the mouth or where the tongue actually moves when saying a particular word. \n\nAccent reduction is hard and it's advanced level stuff (my opinion). As a native English speaker, I speak English with a native American accent. When I speak Vietnamese, I also speak out with a native American accent and often get the tones mixed up. I have friends who are Vietkieu (Overseas Vietnamese) who grew up speaking Vietnamese at home and even they say that when they speak Vietnamese, natives immediately know that they aren't local. Even for them, they will have their \"American Vietnamese\" accent.\n\nAs a native speaker of any particular language, you'll always have your specific accent just because that's how you naturally speak. That's how your mouth naturally moves. A lot of accent reduction is trying to get used to moving your mouth, contouring your tongue, and putting these all together in different ways that you just aren't used to. It takes a lot of time and in some ways, I don't think it's possible to reduce your accent to the point where a local will find it indistinguishable from another native speaking local.
