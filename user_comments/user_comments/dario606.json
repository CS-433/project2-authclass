It is a key player in robotics but the vast majority of people learning Japanese learn it for cultural/touristic/familial reasons and the vast majority studying technology do not learn Japanese.  \n\nGermany is not a \"rather serious and authoritative\" language.  That is your perspective on the language.  I would also hesitate to call Germany a global power instead of the EU as a bloc, although the argument can be made.  \n\nTurkey is in Europe and Asia simultaneously.  I do not know 1 Turk that speaks Russian.  I think you mean \"former Soviet Union\", and even then young people do not speak it in much of the Baltic (save areas of Latvia in particular).  \n\nThe French note is another anglophone stereotype.  French is very important largely due to literature and usage in Africa, making it a fast growing lingua franca for much of the world's future population (pun intended).  \n\nThere is no such thing as \"*a* (singular) Muslim civilization.\"  There are multiple Muslim societies.  Arabic also ain't that important in Albania/Indonesia, which you are including in that 1.5 billion number.  \n\nHindi is important, but the majority of Indians do not speak Hindi as a native language. \n\nI do not know a single person who would say Portuguese is *the* major language of the Southern Hemisphere.  Spanish, while less spoken there, simply has more influence, and English/French are spoken in Africa and Oceania.  \n\nThe choices are fine, but there is no such thing as a best language to learn.

The way you wrote is too formal and too advanced at parts and not in others, which, funnily enough, marks you as non native.\n\nI would have written something like this.\n\nHello everyone, thie is my very first post on Reddit.  I have been learning English for about 8 years and Japanese for 2.  In the beginning I mainly learned in some private school and, of course, from textbooks, but due to my past experiences and the Internet I decided to self-study (principally is too formal).  I don't think (not a mistake originally, but stylistic) that schools help much if you do not spend enough time practicing and studyig.\n\nFor input I am currently using Anki in order to memorize vocabulary and grammar.  I am listeing to native podcasts and vlogs as well to learn new words and get accustomed to the speed of native speech.  (accustomed is a good word here, vocabularies is not a word, native's doesn't make sense, also+additionally is too repetitive, video blogs is not used).  I also have started to read novels and online blogs (moreover is not used).\n\nAlthough I would assume that my reading and listening skills are average (consider is odd here presumably is too repititious, ordinary level is not used), I must admit (I don't like admit here, but it works) that my output skills are far worse then my listening and reading.  So far, due to my lack of direct communication (lack is the word, and using a noun there doesn't make much sense) with native speakers, the only way in which I practice output is shadowing, which I don't find very effective (not effective much is not correct, the end of the sentence is too rushed).  Through this subreddit, I have (had is pluperfect) found some methods (topics means something different) that may be able to solve this problem and came up with a new strategy to imrpove my speakig (in fact, although I joined reddit last year ago (are you German?  since last year is not the term) I haven't written anything yet).\n\nFirst point was all correct.\n\nTake a tutoring class from Italki: does anyone have any advice about this (there is is too overused).  Now/currently (what you said was too verbose) I am hardly able to speak (talk is like discuss) about/on simple topics with horrible grammar and pronunciation.  If I am not able to hold a conversation long enough would Italki have any effect?  (at this point, I would reccomend Italki.  you are not an absolute beginner, starting at b1 it becomes my favorite tool)\n\nDoes writing improve speaking?  I have watched (experience is not used in this circumstance, you experience an event or feeling) some youtube videos on that. (all skills benifit all skills, but speaking is the key to practicing speaking)\n\nFourth point is written well.\n\nLastly (at last is used in different situations, and I wouldn't even put lastly here), thank you for your patience.", "created_utc": "1577652715.0", "edited": "False", "id": "fchpiuw", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_eh2xqy", "parent_id": "t3_eh2xqy", "score": "2", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "dario606", "body": "Absolutely I would buy this.

Not the number you were looking for but hopefully this should help.  Only in Spanish, Russian, French, German, and English (my native language) can I speak pretty freely in conversation.  My secret for upkeep is extensive reading and use in all of these languages. Some of my best friends speak Spanish and Russian, my language on my computer is Russian, I take French at school and read often in German.  Alongside those I also know a bit of Korean and Turkish, although not to that level.  Those I actively study a bit, although I am focusing on German now so they have been languishing a bit.  The key is get languages to a B1 level at least before starting a new one.  Many say B2 and yes, that is better, but you can maintain a B1 decently as well.  Anything below that and your knowledge deteriorates in days, not weeks.  Even if you are C2 in a language it still needs love and attention.  If you go about this correctly, it is absolutely possible to learn and speak multiple languages.  I did this in a space of 7 very focused years.  It has been the most enriching journey of my life.  I cannot recommend it enough.  Also, just because you want to speak (great motivation), don't let that distract you from reading and listening, they are vital even if you just want to speak, as they are more efficient ways of learning.
