So sometimes I watch YouTube videos in Spanish about things I'm interested in, other days I read a few pages aloud from a magazine, and others I try to tackle every category on the list. I found a language partner on HelloTalk and we speak once a week via video call. I rarely watch videos \\*about\\* learning Spanish and went straight to media that interests me....so leave the grammar books for your classes at school and make learning fun and real for yourself by talking with people and consuming media that teenage Spanish speakers would.

I agree that you will probably do much better with self directed learning doing things that are fun, encouraging, and interesting. Spend a lot of time listening (to people talk in movies or shows), memorize a Polish song (and don't even worry about the meaning. Just imitate the sounds). Start fun and low pressure and build your vocabulary and then you will have more fun speaking. Private lessons with a teacher on italki or another platform like it will be much better for you because it will be exactly at your pace.

There are lessons on YouTube that are more interesting and engaging than didactic books. Maybe check out Butterfly Spanish.

Watch lots of shows with subtitles only in Spanish, and you will start to understand from the context. You don't have to look up every word, but pause sometimes if a word has been coming up over and over again and look it up. Maybe even write it down.\nThe most important things are to do something everyday and make it fun! I have a calendar document I make for each month, and each day has the same list of different options (read, write, speak, podcast, etc) to start. I delete the ones I don't use that day and I fill in what I do use. So for example I might write on one day that I watched YouTube, spoke with a language partner, and learned a song. Another day might just have TikTok (I use it only to learn Spanish and follow Spanish speakers). Whatever way is fun and consistent for you will keep you going.
