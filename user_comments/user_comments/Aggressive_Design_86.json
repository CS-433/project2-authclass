When time comes for me to actually start school, I found out it's not as terrifying as I thought and luckily, my results came out great!

If you're interested in art, there's a channel called Reason of art, or if you're interested in films, there's a podcast called \uc778\uc0dd\uc601\ud654 \uc544\ub2d8\ub9d0\uace0, or if you want to learn more \ubc18\ub9d0, cussing and stuff, then there's \uc7a5\uc090\ucb48 with short cartoon, but it's a bit fast, or if you're interested in speech like TedTalk, then there's Sebasi. Bonus: there's an ASMR audio book channel called soft voice hyun-jun to but imo this is usually good for passive listening as the videos are usually really long.
