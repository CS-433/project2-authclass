I remember years back, that video got very popular with the lady saying \"ain't nobody got time for that\" and I didn't understand what that was meant to mean.\n\nIt turns out \"ain't\" can mean any number of things. Some of the uses are more common or informal than others. People sometimes use it in place of words or phrases including but not limited to:   \n\u2022 he/she/it/they/we/I... isn't/aren't/am not (it ain't that hard, he ain't talking to me/I ain't gonna do that...)   \n\u2022 hasn't/haven't (we ain't got juice left/I ain't gone to the shop)   \n\u2022 don't (I ain't drink juice everyday, I ain't see the point of that)   \n\u2022 emphasizer, I guess? (ain't nobody got time for that, ain't no one talks to me like that, ain't no man buys these)\n\nIt's one you'll probably just have to figure out from context.", "created_utc": "1654872301.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ibv00fu", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_v8z4jz", "parent_id": "t3_v8z4jz", "score": "2", "subreddit": "EnglishLearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2u8ap"}, {"author": "jayswaps", "body": "Bending The Arc to Fear", "created_utc": "1654870380.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ibuvl77", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_v8pph9", "parent_id": "t3_v8pph9", "score": "1", "subreddit": "Trivium", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s7p6"}, {"author": "jayswaps", "body": "Incineration: The Broken World", "created_utc": "1654870359.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ibuvjjr", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_v8pph9", "parent_id": "t3_v8pph9", "score": "1", "subreddit": "Trivium", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s7p6"}, {"author": "jayswaps", "body": "Here's what I think is the [original video ](https://www.instagram.com/p/B-nqQaCjBpC/?igshid=YmMyMTA2M2Y=) if anyone's interested.", "created_utc": "1654751798.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ibp71oo", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_v7x00g", "parent_id": "t3_v7x00g", "score": "2", "subreddit": "Peripheryband", "subreddit_id": "t5_35hbm"}, {"author": "jayswaps", "body": "Robert Pattinson in The Batman", "created_utc": "1654745313.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ibown1v", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_v82oza", "parent_id": "t3_v82oza", "score": "3", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i"}, {"author": "jayswaps", "body": "The original is unquestionably the best.

It is a *backstab*, you have no business pulling one off if you are facing the enemy. Too many times you end up pulling a backstab or a hit on the enemy that you had no business achieving and vice versa. This isn't really any worse in DS2 than it is in other Souls games, though. The netcode is a pain.", "created_utc": "1653338910.0", "edited": "False", "id": "i9q7zgr", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_uvk9nj", "parent_id": "t1_i9q7bgm", "score": "1", "subreddit": "DarkSouls2", "subreddit_id": "t5_2vqni"}, {"author": "jayswaps", "body": "Well, let's see...  \n\n\nThe balance offered by the Estus Flask system absolutely falls apart because of the ridiculous abundance of Life Gems that you can easily stock up for as soon as you kill the damn tutorial boss. This makes the game a bit of a joke as you don't have to put any consideration into your enemy encounters - as long as a single enemy doesn't drain your helath bar fully, you are practically unkillable. This ruins whatever sense of balance the amount of Estus between bonfires provided.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe bad hitboxes, terrible netcoding, broken backstabs as well as the addition of ADP make the combat an absolute mess for a significant portion of the game. I could speak about any one of these issues at length, they have a severe effect on how the combat functions.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe game suffers heavily from spam. Instead of designing enemies with interesting movesets, the developers decided to hit CTRL + V more times in order to increase difficulty. It's evident that the focus on difficulty was intentional. The hag comically tells you how you're gonna die over and over again at the start of the game and there's even a global death counter featured. This was never meant to be the focus but the developers of DS2 wanted to make the game hard at all costs and it shows.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis happens in boss battles as well. Many of the bosses have random mobs thrown into the arena in order to artificially increase difficulty instead of actually designing a challenging bossfight. The Belfry Gargoyles, Skeleton Lords, Executioners Chariot, Royal Rat Authority, Prowling Magus, Duke's Dear Freja, Royal Rat Vanguard, Graverobber, Burnt Ivory King and Lud & Zallen fights all suffer from this to differing degrees among others. Some of them are literally nothing but a room full of basic mobs you're decided to slash at with a boss bar slapped onto it. That is ridiculous. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMany other bosses are an embarrassment for entirely different reasons, though. The Dragonrider, Covetous Demon, Guardian Dragon, Ancient Dragon, Throne Watcher & Defender and Nashandra fights are all absurdly easy or have incredibly simple exploits that you can abuse, making the fights a joke. This extends all the way to the bloody endgame boss.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat is not to mention the fact that some of the bosses are just lazily copy pasted into other areas or even as another bossfight. Bosses like Old Dragonslayer, Belfry Gargoyles, Smelter Demon, Scorpioness Najka, Dragonriders and Lud & Zallen are all either near or complete copies from DS1 or another area of DS2. Many of the other bosses inexplicably show up in other areas just to pad the number of enemies even though they make no sense in being there.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe AI can also be absolutely abysmal and the pathing of enemies in individual and group encounters can be downright embarrassing. It's unfinished and it results in them routinely getting lost, running into walls, killing themselves and any number other less significant issues.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAll of that without even mentioning the poorly designed world of the game, by the way.\n\nI could honestly go on for hours but I think I've made enough points for now. The game is extremely flawed on many levels. Pisspoor design is littered throughout all of it. That doesn't mean you can't enjoy it. That doesn't mean it can't be your favorite game.

Let me elaborate.\n\nIn a discussion with the first person, you would simply have to explain what gives the animal lives value and why they deserve moral consideration. If you convince them of that, they will be on board because they'll be against harm to those who deserve that moral consideration.\n\nTrying to convince the second person would be a lot more complicated as they will agree they deserve consideration but not enough for us not to kill them.
