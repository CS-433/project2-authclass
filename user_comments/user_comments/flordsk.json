Take a look at Brad Philpot's English A LAL textbook. It's a great resource.\n2. Hamlet is a difficult text for many reasons: there are 3 different versions of Hamlet and I don't know which one your teacher is using (likely a \"conflated\" version), it's a long play, the language is tricky even if you're a native speaker (I don't know if it's your case), and so on. The good thing is that Hamlet is possibly the most extensively commented text like, ever. You could literally fill a library only with books about Hamlet. Thus, choosing good resources to study the play is another challenge, simply from the sheer abundance of criticism you can choose from. As a Shakespearean, I tend to recommend Emma Smith to the non-initiated. Don't get me wrong, she's a heavy-weight academic, but her more accessible stuff is just great: insightful and fun without losing an inch of rigor and depth. You can Google \"Emma Smith Hamlet podcast\" and listen to her lecture on this tragedy for free. Also, when it comes to Shakespeare, watch the movies! Seriously, there are many great adaptations of Shakespeare's plays out there and since his works are meant to be performed watching them unfold with live actors is a legit way of studying them and seeing how they can come to life. \n3. You're right, getting a 7 is nearly impossible, but a 6 is totally doable if you're willing to apply yourself.\n4. Read the news, from the Daily Mail to the Economist to Vice. Read as many different non-literary texts as you can. Pay attention to how they can construct meaning. Take a contemporary event and see how it's portrayed in different media outlets. Pay attention to images, as well. There's a great unit in Philpot's book about how to read images.\n5. Peer review. You and your classmates are all on the same boat, so  write practice papers/HL essays and read each other's work. Protip: reading your stuff aloud helps more than you can imagine.\n6. Try to keep your learner portfolio updated and take notes of the books you read. Since you'll apparently have to rely on self-instruction more than you'd like, it's a good idea to keep your notes in one place. You can even include the non-literary texts you come across in this folder for future reference, or to revise different text types for Paper 1.\n\nIf you have any other questions, feel free to DM me.", "created_utc": "1588258847.0", "edited": "False", "id": "fp2bjao", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_gavogs", "parent_id": "t3_gavogs", "score": "3", "subreddit": "IBO", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s05l"}, {"author": "flordsk", "body": "That'd be Cat 1.

You can obviously bullshit your way through English A, and it honestly might work, but learning how to bullshit effectively is one of the most valuable skills you can learn, and it can even be said to be English's greatest contribution to a student's education. Anyway, as said by Northrop Frye, \"teaching literature is impossible; that's why it's difficult\". Some people even claim that the ability to properly interpret literature is \"a gift\", you have it or you don't, you are one of the chosen ones born with it or well, good luck, give up on reading Emily Dickinson, find something else to do.\nAnyway, what advice can I offer you? Take whatever text you're reading and see what renowned critics have said about it. See what sort of analysis they're making. You'll probably notice that they're making inferences about the text, thinking about possibilities, about the questions that the text is asking rather than que answers it's giving. They're reading between the lines. They'll probably talk about other texts that are somehow related to the one under analysis. Maybe they'll talk about how the text refers to the Bible, or to the Greeks, or to Shakespeare. Perhaps they'll relate the text to something in the real world: a historical moment, a school of thought, the zeitgeist, the author's life (something discouraged and unfashionable these days but sometimes relevant, I'll admit). They'll talk about how this text belongs to a very long tradition, how it conforms to this tradition in some aspects and how it revolts against it in others. Long story short, see what these guys are doing and try to do it yourself. You'll lack the sophistication, you'll definitely lack the cultural background, you'll lack the authority, but you'll become familiar with a certain way of thinking about the literary text. Then it's going to become second nature to you. Hopefully. Now, careful with two things: avoid being obvious and don't \"overinterpret\". Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar, as the saying goes.

The problem with the former is that English teachers sometimes are clueless about other areas of knowledge, especially when it comes to the sciences. The problem with the latter is that Philosophy teachers want to keep teaching Philosophy, which is not the point of TOK.\nMy tips to you:\n- Study the course as much as you can. See if you can get in touch with examiners and if your school can pay for your IB workshop, read the TOK guide, watch TOK presentations, read TOK essays, study the shit out of the assessment instrument, etc.\n- Read random stuff. Math, economics, biology, arts, sociology, engineering, whatever. Obviously you don't need to master these fields, but try to be familiar with some \"Real Life Situations\" taking place today in these fields. You can use this sort of material in class.\n- Get ready for the curriculum, it'll be released in the next few months I think.\n- Try to make TOK as practical as possible and connect TOK to what students are learning in other subjects. Make sure you work with your colleagues and that they too are familiar with TOK. Just because you're the official TOK teacher doesn't mean you're the sole responsible for TOK.

Think about it this way: can I answer my question in regards to different areas of knowledge? If you can, then your question is probably a second order knowledge questions, that is, truly \"about knowledge\" itself.
