When people think of the US, they think of NYC, and of course the whole country can't be as developed as NYC.\n\n**EDIT :** For people who don't know what a food desert is and getting uppity about it:\n\nA food desert is an area that has limited access to affordable and nutritious food, in contrast with an area with higher access to supermarkets or vegetable shops with fresh foods, which is called a food oasis. The designation considers the type and quality of food available to the population, in addition to the accessibility of the food through the size and proximity of the food stores.\n\nIn 2010, the United States Department of Agriculture reported that 23.5 million people in the U.S. live in \"food deserts\", meaning that they live in low income census tracts more than one mile from a supermarket in urban or suburban areas and more than 10 miles from a supermarket in rural areas.\n\nFood deserts tend to be inhabited by low-income residents with reduced mobility; this makes them a less attractive market for large supermarket chains. Food deserts lack suppliers of fresh foods, such as meats, fruits, and vegetables. Instead, the available foods are often processed and high in sugar and fats, which are known contributors to the proliferation of obesity in the U.S.\"\n\nA food desert is **not** just a place that never had infrastructure to begin with, including remote villages in jungles and deserts.
