I wanted to pursue a PhD when I graduated in 2018, but in order to bring my wife over I needed to have a stable job. A PhD program would\u2019ve been fine to sponsor a spouse, but the true issue was location.

I can share details about the job and how I got into the role.\n\nI\u2019m guessing that what you had in mind is what my company called localization specialists. They translate text, work with local voice actors, and do other language asset related tasks. This is one role in video game localization, but there are other jobs such as project management / production roles. I did the latter when I lived in Japan.\n\nI got an offer from the company interviewing at [Boston Career Forum](https://careerforum.net/en/event/bos/) in the US during my senior year of undergrad and moved to Japan for the new job right after graduation. I had passed N1 already and had spent 1 year studying abroad in Japan by the time I had interviewed. I started studying Japanese in high school, though I grew up bilingual in Mandarin and English.\n\nMy first role at the company was domestic (Japanese) marketing: devising advertising strategy, writing blog articles, appearing on TV/live streams at Tokyo Game Show to promote a game, and a bunch of other media and sales related jobs. My job required native-level fluency and was 100% in Japanese as I was directly working on copy and content that customers in Japan saw on a daily basis.\n\nI moved into localization at the same company after that. Because I also speak Mandarin, I worked on localization from Japanese into Traditional / Simplified Chinese and Korean. I worked on Thai once. I was involved in working with local sales and marketing teams to make sure that localized titles were launched on time, that we had marketing assets available, or flying around countries drinking with people to make business deals. I also did debugging and other types of quality assurance that didn\u2019t involve linguistic tasks. I worked with companies like Square Enix, Sega, and Bandai Namco which was also pretty cool. Again, this role requires native-level Japanese in order to handle the responsibility of business contracts and communication.\n\nOverall, my role was about making sure specialists weren\u2019t bogged down in asinine minutiae (so they could focus on translation and voice recording), putting together the right marketing / sales numbers for various target markets, and managing or signing contracts between localization developers, publishers, and the original game studio. E.g. when a game dev made an unreasonable request or didn\u2019t provide the right assets, I was the one on the phone with their producer figuring out how to solve the problem so our translators and QA team didn\u2019t have to.\n\nI don\u2019t have personal experience being a localization specialist, but in general they have to do a wide variety of work including but not limited to script writing / translation, working with local artists to recreate logos, hiring and overseeing local voice actors, and creating assets used by marketing teams for promotions.

I\u2019m not familiar with your exact situation, but my undergrad is in developmental and cognitive psychology. I contemplated psych PhDs before my transition to computer science.\n\nTL;DR I recommend you get a sense of the research methods you are interested in, not just the topic of it. Clinical and experimental degrees are very different. If you want to do research on specific drug interventions, you may need to find clinical neuropsychology labs. If you want to study psychotherapy methods, counseling degrees are a good bet. If you want to study quantitative methods in clinical practice, an experimental degree would set you up well. Finding the intersection between all of these can be difficult and may depend on the school / program.\n\nClinical degrees (like the CMHC program at UNC you mentioned) have coursework focused on teaching how to do counseling, but may or may not have a heavy emphasis on research skills. You should ask the programs you\u2019re applying to if they have data on the number of people going to PhDs after graduation and make sure it\u2019s not a heavily practitioner focused program.\n\nExperimental psychology degrees are heavily quantitative. For example, if you wanted to do experiments for evidence-based therapy, you would need more statistical training than your typical regression or ANOVA type analyses. (I work with fixed / random effects models, hierarchical models, and structural models for example.) Experimental psych masters encompass many different fields and not just mental health research too, so you may have to spend time on less relevant coursework. You may even find it difficult to develop client-facing skills depending in the program.\n\nThat said, some people do both PsyD / Clinical and PhD degrees, so it\u2019s not like choosing a professional and/or clinical practice degree prevents you from pursuing a PhD. You can\u2019t really go wrong with your choice as long as you make sure you are clear on the type of research you want to do because most of programs have research opportunities. \n\nThe key is knowing which programs let you do the research you want to do.

I\u2019ve only picked prestige over fit and it\u2019s worked well for me. For undergrad, I chose a highly competitive public school over a private school I really liked, and for my first masters program I chose a school that was top 4 for my field in the nation even though I hated the idea of moving to that city.

On the other hand, a friend of mine that went to a smaller school for the community and location later realized he wanted to major in something their school didn\u2019t have a program for.

I did my undergrad thesis in computational psycholinguistics and spent most of my time studying how children learn language.\n\nI share your pain as I'm debating if I want to do Cognitive Science, Information Science, or Computer Science for my PhD. I don't really fit in any of these one departments, and faculty I'm interested is scattered depending on the institution. I'm assuming that you've found faculty in many different departments you might want to look for, and that's why you're stuck. I won't add any advice on finding the right advisor fit.\n\nTo differentiate between departments, I'd say you should consider the curriculum and what type of students and faculty you need support from to do the type of research you want to do. A psych program's grad level classes will require different coursework than a ling program's. Some people want to learn something new in a different department, while others would rather focus on their previous studies and double down. It's partially personal preference.\n\nThe second to consider is methodologies. In a ling department you'll be working with theoretical syntax people, people doing field work, semanticists, etc. In a psych department, you'll be working with people with clinical experience, neuroscientists, etc. If you want to continue doing pathology, and want more experience with abnormal psychology or clinical neuropsychology, then maybe a psych department is better for that. If you want to do more sociological field work, then linguistics is probably a better bet. I would say both departments do computational work, though I do see more advanced methods in linguistics these days (i.e. deep learning for natural language processing).\n\nLastly, it's also worth looking at how many faculty are nominated to both departments. My alma mater, UCSD, has faculty shared between Psychology, Linguistics, and Cognitive Science, and you should be able to get support for psycholing in any of those.

Having worked in a FAANG where 60% of UXRs have a PhD, as a masters holder I never felt that anyone discriminated against me for not having a PhD. In fact, many fresh out of academia liked it when I shared stories about my experiences in product trenches (i.e. marketing, product management roles).\n\nHowever, I have met people who were unsure if certain methodologies were sound and often these arguments came from people with PhDs. In general, the source of these disputes had nothing to do with having a PhD or not -- it came down to perspectives on how to justify methods. The key to solving these disagreements is in having senior members of the research team or research managers facilitate disagreements. It's not like methodological debates don't happen in academia. I just had one with my professor. (I'm an academic now and left UXR.)\n\nI think it is worth looking beyond the demographics. What are the disagreements about? How to do quant? Proper qualitative research methods? Or is it more about stuff like \"If it's not a regression model, it's shit?\" I would recommend doing some due diligence into the nature of the disagreements to see if it's really a personality issue, or instead one of working experience / background / culture.\n\nPhDs will have much more thorough training in debating these methods than a typical masters student, which is also a good thing. It may also mean that your newly minted PhDs, without much working experience, might not realize how much work goes into creating impact and finding the right method for the right stakeholder request.  This can mean opting for a method that may not be considered as standard (depending on the training the researcher has).

Sometimes it's just about what kind of cultural knowledge you have.**\n\nI lived and worked in Japan for 5 years. The work was 99% Japanese, and I worked in sales / marketing, speaking on a daily basis with Japanese customers or business partners from other companies. Most of whom I worked with didn't speak English even at a conversational level.\n\nI remember this one time I broke down because I was so overworked managing a huge advertising budget, making a TV commercial, etc. for a product launch and yet I was **also** expected to know all of these cultural things like sending the right type of fruit juice for X business partner who helped make the project a success, ordering the proper greetings cards / bouquets, and having to figure how to set up the right parties for the right people. Coworkers would help and explain how certain things had to be written or said to our business partners, but it just didn't **click** and the whole process was one of uncertainty. The cultural expectations were way more stressful than my actual job.\n\nHere's another story: at a particular end of year company dinner where I had to host (in Japanese companies, the youngest employee usually takes cares of \u98f2\u307f\u4f1a), the conversation revolved around some recent variety TV involving a few comedians and personalities. My boss was into some comedic act, my coworkers were into it, and even by boss's boss was into it. I don't watch TV so it's just impossible to follow this kind of conversation. Usually I just sit around listening when these kinds of discussions happen and do my best to make sure people have a good time.\n\nTo echo your feelings, I felt like I just couldn't understand everything and I'd never be truly fluent in the most natural way. Not because there a lot of terminology for work, not because I couldn't speak to Japanese customers properly, not because I have a slight accent, but because everything combined in the native environment requires unspoken cultural knowledge.\n\nHere's an alternative perspective. My wife, who is sort of a \u5e30\u56fd\u5b50\u5973 with time spent in the US and Japan at various times in life, has very little discernable accent in English and is fluent by all definition. We currently live in the U.S., and she frequently comes to me to ask about stuff her colleagues say or messages she gets at work, especially for casual comments. It's not that she doesn't understand the language. Instead, she's not sure what other people are trying to communicate and how to respond.\n\nAnyone who's lived and worked in a foreign environment experiences something similar. My dad immigrated to the U.S., and he always said: \"I have no doubts that I was passed up for promotion because I don't have an interest in sports and have no idea how to talk casually using American football terminology.\" Don't beat yourself up over not knowing everything.", "created_utc": "1640093390.0", "edited": "1640097215.0", "id": "hpf79ue", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_rl2joy", "parent_id": "t3_rl2joy", "score": "12", "subreddit": "LearnJapanese", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qyls"}, {"author": "Kylaran", "body": "Having worked in marketing and UXR, to me the difference is arbitrary in terms of methods.

A UXR needs to have a strong relationship with design and engineering due to their role in the product development cycle. A market researcher is not always familiar with the product development process, and instead may bring a knowledge of topics like sales, promotional strategy, and advertising strategy.\n\nWhen I was a marketing strategist and researcher, I spent a lot of time studying media penetration and marketing trends, trying to figure out not only what our pricing / messaging should be but also how to reach the people who were likely to buy it.

The Japanese version of the article doesn\u2019t provide much more info \u2014 it only says that [si] is commonly treated as \u30b7.\n\nIt\u2019s worth pointing out that the use of some digraphs is very inconsistent in Japan.

So that means that, to some degree, different Japanese speakers and different translators felt a need to accommodate the sounds differently. \n\nIt\u2019s possible that there is something about [si] that has made it immune to needing a new digraph because most people just find it comfortable to pronounce as \u30b7. It would be interesting to see if Japanese people perceive  \u30c1 and \u30c6\u30a3 as \u201cdistant\u201d from each other compared to [sw], [si], and \u30b7.

Your feedback has given me a much better sense of how to communicate my interests.

From this conversation, I've learned that it's more similar to my MS application SoPs and I should mostly focus on the many learning experiences that come along the way. I do hear a lot about how PhD students might change research focus throughout their 5 years!\n\nI consider myself a methodological generalist but a subfield / problem specialist (social computing, computational social science). Rather than focus on my previous research and a few specific burning research questions about problems X and Y under these fields, it sounds like I should instead tailor the SoP to focus on the fields themselves.\n\nFor 1 and 2, I think the focus on subfield will mitigate the need to be too specific. As you said, the department will know their faculty more than myself and I shouldn't need to overthink it outside of naming who's work I can learn from. For 3, I think that by focusing on field and identifying areas that I may not have experience in or would be excited to learn about would highlight my flexibility, even if the exact project interests don't match (i.e. a professor might be working on healthcare when I'm interested in financial applications).\n\nLastly, I'll definitely start working on connecting with potential mentors as you suggested.

It is not possible to communicate clearly using written standard Mandarin or Classical Chinese. It is possible to guess, and the communication will be better than just body language, but there will be a lot of confusion. \n\nThe biggest issue is that much of Classical Chinese and modern Chinese is SVO while Japanese is SOV, and grammatical particles function very differently due to word order. Although there are some SOV constructions in Classical Chinese, it remains that the flexibility of word order would lead to a lot of difficulty in parsing sentences.\n\nThis leads to guesses and issues with understanding word boundaries. When my wife (who doesn\u2019t speak mandarin) travels with me in China, she can make guesses about what some character pairs mean, but anything beyond that at the sentence level is very difficult to communicate in writing.  \n\nLastly, although Japanese people study kanbun in school, the curriculum does not teach them to read and write kanbun. Instead, it is usually in a classics or literature class and the goal is for them to read and convert the grammar or older characters into modern Japanese. The knowledge will be focused on the impact of Chinese literature on Japan, or as a type of world literature, but not necessarily truly learning or studying Classical Chinese. \n\nFor example, many students in Japan read \u674e\u767d\u2018s poems, but it requires a lot of glosses for students to make sense of it:\n\nhttps://exam.fukuumedia.com/kokugo-kanshi/\n\nWithout advanced education, it is simply unlikely that any random person off the street will be able to read what you wrote.

It doesn\u2019t mean that someone knows Classical Chinese, but rather that Japanese can be read without kana. The fake Chinese internet slang uses Japanese characters which just happen to have come from Classical Chinese.\n\nPerhaps most interesting in the sentence above is that none of the words are actually Sino-Japanese, instead semantic adoptions for native words.\n\n\u3042\u306a\u305f(\u306f)\u3042\u3057\u305f\u3069\u3053(\u306b)\u3044\u304f\n\nAgain, this example emphasizes that the knowledge is orthographic convention and not productive for communication.

For these verbs, when you drop the i vowel, it causes two consonants to appear next to each other which is a violation of Japanese phonotactics, so the preference is to just adopt the /t/ sound.\n\n(FYI, historically -u verbs were written as \u3075 reflecting a /h/ sound that disappeared in modern Japanese. This is why these verbs assimilate to /t/ because /h/ followed by /t/ would not be allowed in Japanese.)\n\nThus, \u3044\u304d\u3066 to \u3044\u3063\u3066 is the only other allowable option if a speaker wants to make things easier on themselves by removing sounds (the goal of onbin) but maintaining the same rhythmic structure.", "created_utc": "1636033532.0", "edited": "1636034649.0", "id": "hja4luh", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_qmgj74", "parent_id": "t3_qmgj74", "score": "13", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "Kylaran", "body": "No one ever stops to wonder why the number of characters matches the number of letters in the English alphabet.", "created_utc": "1635896232.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hj2uq0m", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_qlealy", "parent_id": "t1_hj2bwuc", "score": "32", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "Kylaran", "body": "I took the course as my first class, but I have a lot of research experience and don\u2019t come from a CS background so it was sort of a way for me to ease into OMSCS.

This is very important when looking at languages that borrowed Chinese characters.\n\nWhen it comes to the sky example you pointed out, in Japanese the etymology actually stems from a difference between heaven \u5929 (ama, ame \\\\ ten) and the space between heaven and earth \u7a7a (sora / kuu). For example, \u5929\u56fd (tengoku) is the translation for Christian / Islamic / Jewish heaven, and \u5929\u3064\u795e (amatsukami) refers to Shinto gods that live in the heavenly realm. In other words, \u5929 here represents a place similar in meaning to \u5929\u754c. On the other hand, \u7a7a refers to the space in between \u5929 and \u5730.\n\n\u5929\u7a7a appears in Mandarin, Korean, and Japanese which emphasizes how far away the heavens is. This is not a form of reduplication, but rather each component conveys a different semantic element.\n\nFor various reasons, the common word that is translated as \"sky\" in the modern day just happens to be \u7a7a. Is it equivalent to \u5929? Some people might say yes. Others might say no. The etymology is actually two different native words.\n\nNative Korean \ud558\ub298 does not make this distinction like Japanese, as it can refer to both space above the earth and the heavenly realm.

As the Wikipedia [article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinema_of_Hong_Kong#Language_and_sound) on HK cinema states:\n\n>For decades, films were typically shot silent, with dialogue and all other sound dubbed afterwards.

This means that the competition you face will have a very different profile. UXR internships are not only rare, but some of them even ask for people who are completing their PhDs. A chance to do an internship or accomplish more research at a 2 year program can be better for finding a job.\n\nI came into MHCI at CMU with 4 years of job experience, which helped a lot with the job search after graduation. I think that if I didn\u2019t have any work experience, I never would\u2019ve gotten the job I currently have.", "created_utc": "1616278766.0", "edited": "1616280974.0", "id": "grmyzmc", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_m9gyky", "parent_id": "t3_m9gyky", "score": "5", "subreddit": "hci", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qo19"}, {"author": "Kylaran", "body": "Some roles called TPM do exist and seem to be looking for CS undergrad -> MBA or undergrad business -> MSCS type folks.

It\u2019s not historical though. I think one of the big pieces of the paper is that the data is well tagged since the authors use flairs from I think the real innovation here isn\u2019t the computational side but the fact that Reddit is a rich trove of self-tagged crowdsourced data for this type of study.\n\nOther people have mentioned sparsity and over fitting issues. I\u2019ll also suggest another major challenge that coincides with avoiding overfitting and sparsity: effect sizes and model evaluation.\n\nThere is an issue of small effect sizes on highly noisy data that will make the patterns you find suspect. I work in an area that deals with researching specific subsets of actions from Reddit, Twitter, Wikipedia, etc. like detecting toxicity or knowledge transfer. The interactions are so small and only deal with a specific subset of all language data. Not only does this require providing the right dataset (which takes a long time) for training supervised methods but it also requires getting lucky with enough examples of the phenomenon itself so you can actually detect it reliably.\n\nSo here\u2019s the dilemma. I\u2019d get very different results from subreddit to subreddit, just like how different languages in a proposed language family have very different amounts of data that we can use. Then looking at something specific from that would require some very serious tuning of the model . As others have said, overfitting and sparsity. But if you try to generalize it, you now have an issue where your signal to noise ratio is really high. By pure random chance, you may see patterns where they don\u2019t exist. This leads to a whole suite of other issues in benchmarking and evaluation to determine if your model even picked up the right relationship in the first place. By overfitting you might as well be hand-making rules to study specific language families, but by generalizing you have to now prove that your instrument is sensitive enough to detect the right patterns.\n\nI imagine that with any ML approach to historical linguistics, showing connections between ancestors of languages would require looking at sets of small changes that apply to a group of languages but not others.

Chinese characters were spread to Korea and Japan via Buddhism (or at least, majorly driven by the adoption of Buddhism) which also coincides with a need for language related to funerals and other important religious services.\n\nThis is evident in the history of the word 4 in Japanese. I will paraphrase [Japanese Wikipedia](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%9B%9B%E3%81%AE%E5%AD%97), but apparently 4 was considered auspicious in ancient Japan and Shinto as evidenced by the Kojiki, which writes that the best way to pay one's respects is to do it four times. The idea is that the native Japanese pronunciation (*yo*) is close to the word for good (*yoi*). There's evidence from the Heian period that 4 came to be associated with death in the Sino-Japanese pronunciation, after which there was an active effort to replace *shi* with *yon*. As an aside, it's worth noting that even today in Japan, funeral services are often carried out at Buddhist temples and not at Shinto shrines.\n\nWhile I couldn't find much evidence for the influence of Buddhism on Korean funeral rites -- it appears that the dominance of Joseon's Neo-Confucianism subdued the influence of Buddhism on Korean culture -- Buddhism was [more widespread](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_Buddhism#Historical_overview_and_development) when it was first introduced to Korea during the Three Kingdoms period and up until the Goryeo period.\n\nConsidering the history of Chinese characters and Buddhism, it's possible that the origin of this superstition started in China and spread not only because of the similarities in the words that were borrowed, but the vehicle in which death could be talked about. This allowed for a conceptual and cultural foundation for the superstition among the educated, which at the time included a lot of Buddhist monks.

There are quite a few nouns that use jukujikun for historical reasons. For example, the name is something more ancient and native, but someone wanted to give it a nicer or different semantic meaning.\n\nThe cause of this is the use of characters for semantic but not phonetic meaning. This is well-documented in cultures that had previously adopted Chinese characters for native words that have the same meaning even if they don't use them nowadays. \u6c34 could be read as both Korean \ubb3c (mul, native) \uc218 (su, Sino-Korean) similar to how it could be pronounced \u307f\u305a (mizu, native) or \u3059\u3044 (sui, Sino-Japanese) in Japanese.

The big difference is that tech, known often for its high salaries for engineers, also provides the equivalent high salaries to its UX teams. This means that the jobs are few but in high demand.\n\n>it's only the bigger giants who have the maturity to bring that type of staff in house and I obviously see a bunch of PhDs in industry.\n\nA start up would not necessarily want and/or need a PhD because they want someone who has years of experience working on product, can work quickly, and understands how to translate research insights into product impact.

I'd argue that along with the need for specialized research, big tech moves slow enough that they can afford to bring in more methodological, rigorous, and theoretically-grounded researchers. A lot of what you see is the effects of competition, and the fact that FAANG already has a lot of PhDs so they'll bring a certain flavor of approach to interviews during the hiring process.\n\nThat said, I work directly with one or two UXRs with only a bachelors and they're brilliant.

I'm pretty familiar with the analyst, UXR, and marketing spaces. I'm currently in the process of transitioning into human-centered data science with a focus on HCI and NLP.\n\nMy advice to you is to find opportunities to actually try out qualitative research if that's what you think you're be interested in. This might be finding a project at your current company in which you can convince a team to take you on as a trainee/seek mentorship, or it might be as a project for an online class like a certification. You don't want to be in a position where you do all this extra work and find out you don't like the job.\n\nAs for possible connections between analyst work and UXR work, here are a few skills you can work on that will translate easily into the UXR space. In general, many of these skills fall under **quantitative social science** which you can also get a masters in if you choose to do so.\n\n* **Survey design and analysis** is a major skill for all UXRs. If you're planning to take the QUXR into qual UXR path, you should make sure to study survey methods and that you can apply things like significance testing, regression, etc. to survey data.\n* **Logs analysis** for UXRs is generally finding patterns in logged data that engineering teams provide. I'm assuming that if you already work as an analyst you know SQL, data manipulation, ETL, and general EDA. From a skills perspective, you probably have the foundation, but what you need to demonstrate on your resume/portfolio is that you can answer questions about **user behavior** with logs data. Analysts sometimes work with financial data that is not user-centric, so make sure that you're focusing on user problems.\n* **Experimental design and analysis** is also something I'd guess that analysts are familiar with. For UXRs, this to UI design is a highly desired skill. Try to find opportunities for you to work on A/B tests with designers to not only show collaboration skills with stakeholders but also your familiarity with measuring user behavior with design prototypes.\n\nAnother set of skills you may want to look into are **market research skills** which can overlap in methods. I used these as a marketer and exposure to them really helped transitioning into UXR. Experience with the pros/cons of methods like focus groups, intercept surveys/interviews, and market/user segmentation all translate well to the UXR toolkit.\n\nPersonally, I got my masters in HCI after working in marketing and ended up working as a UXR in FAANG. Dropping $$$ for the masters degree was completely worth it for me. I had background in experimental psychology but no real computing and design background, so the HCI degree was critical in helping me pick up skills in qualitative research and usability. I did some academic research using qualitative methods during my masters and that's why I'm able to perform well at qual research even when working with teammates who have PhDs in anthropology", "created_utc": "1611541851.0", "edited": "1611542252.0", "id": "gknydpr", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_l48xmi", "parent_id": "t3_l48xmi", "score": "3", "subreddit": "UXResearch", "subreddit_id": "t5_34zqz"}, {"author": "Kylaran", "body": "Ah, I see!

This explains \u4e94\u5341\u5d50. \u5341 was read as \u305d, so combining with \u4e94 pronounced as \u3044 you have \u3044\u305d in \u4e94\u5341\u516d.\n\nAs for \u304b\u305a, it\u2019s not only \u4e00 but actually other numbers like \u30cb\u3001\u4e09\u3001\u4e07 etc can be read as \u304b\u305a. I couldn\u2019t find a source for the etymology, but my guess would be that it\u2019s because it signifies counting the number of children.\n\n\u4e00\u90ce(\u3044\u3061\u308d\u3046)\uff1d\u592a\u90ce(\u305f\u308d\u3046)\nBoth mean \u201cfirst\u201d or \u201cstart\u201d.

According to Wiktionary (https://en.m.wiktionary.org/wiki/\u4e09), \u3055\u3076 is only an accepted reading for names. However, old Japanese did not have \u3093 as that sound was borrowed from Sinitic. One of the oldest ways of writing \u3055\u3093 is \u3055\u3080, which might explain why we see \u3055\u3076.\n\nName readings are called [nanori](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanori).

I have heard of people with even less relevant backgrounds getting in (i.e. biology, finance) so I can't imagine that this would be too much of a negative.\n\n> Realize you cannot do everything and do it well. You can get some knowledge of most main fields, but you can't be a sytactician, morphologists, phonologist, historical linguists, etc. all well and a top level.\n\nI'm not interested in being everything, but I feel there is value in doing a Ling PhD in which you acquire a baseline understanding of these subdisciplines. I believe this is the same no matter which PhD program you choose in the U.S. I.e. a CS PhD requires systems and CS theory courses and a DH PhD based out of a humanities department may similarly require history or anthro coursework.\n\n> Depends on where you study.

Honorifics are different ways of expressing honor or respect, which is a [subset of register](https://cpb-us-w2.wpmucdn.com/web.sas.upenn.edu/dist/1/494/files/2018/08/22Agha2002Honorific-Registers-13mzkti.pdf) that governs formal situations.\n\nThe T-V distinction is lexical honorific\u2014 it affects which words you use to express respect or formality. There is a similar concept in both Korean and Japanese where you use different words to express honorifics. One example is \ub9d0\uc500\ud558\ub2e4 or \u4ef0\u308b as honorific words that replace \ub9d0\ud558\ub2e4 and \u8a00\u3046. Another good example might be honorific addresses such as \uadc0\ud558 as a reference for \u201cyou\u201d in corporate settings.\n\nSince there are pragmatic rules (\u201cnorms\u201d) that describe the usage of these words, this is a type of honorifics used as a specific type of honorific register.\n\nAs far as I know, Romance languages do not have grammatical honorifics like Korean and Japanese do. For example, Korean might use -\uaed8\uc11c instead of \uac00/\uc774. This does not change the meaning of the word but instead uses a different particle to express honorifics. Another grammatical example is verb conjugations like \ud558\uc2ed\uc2dc\uc624 \uccb4 in Korean or the use of \u30fc\u3089\u308c\u308b in Japanese. These conjugations do not change the meaning of the stem, but use grammar to show honorifics.

More specifically, the question is addressing theories of change and causality.\n\nu/MuppetManiac is referring to an experiment that aimed to disprove the long-standing theory of [spontaneous generation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spontaneous_generation#Antiquity), which was posited back in antiquity as early as Artistotle as an explanation for the creation of life. One hypothesis at the time was indeed that things would come out of nothing; flies would be born out of meat just like geese were born out of barnacles. According to this theory, fresh meat was not around long enough for life to generate from it. Redi's experiment proved that some sort of \"parent\" was required for life to happen. This type of theory was more broadly a type of causal theory about biogenesis, rather than something specific about the process of curing meat.\n\n**Taking a step back, here's a question for you.** **How do we even define rotten?** I'm not even sure if thinking of food preservation using a term like rotten makes sense. By modern standards, a lot of fermented foods are still edible but smell/taste absolutely disgusting. Hakarl and surstromming are good examples. Are they rotten? \n\nAnother way to think of the history of food is: if eating something doesn't kill you, it can be eaten. What we know from pre-historic times is that methods like salting or fermenting prevent food from killing you via collective knowledge. That's all any of our ancestors needed to know.\n\nWe know from food history that humans have been fermenting food for thousands of years, but there's little mention of theories about what caused fermentation. Yogurt and cheese are natural results of fermentation of milk in bags, something attested in ancient North Africa and the steppes of Central Asia. China has been documented as manufacturing koji since 300 BC. There's evidence that ancient Mesopotamians discovered beer by leaving wheat out when it rained, only to later find an edible alcoholic beverage.\n\nMost of the above didn't require an explanation of why something happened.

It\u2019ll depend on what you want to collect data on.\n\nContextual inquiry is the data collection step in contextual design and emphasizes observing users in their natural habit.

Let\u2019s say you\u2019re creating an app for order inside restaurants. Are you able to actually observe examples of this?
