My full-German mother hates it. It's feels very much like \"German stereotype bingo\" - beer, cider, Oktoberfest, football, pretzels, Bayern. I adore that they included the Bremer Stadtmusikanten, but hate how they drew it bc it is not symmetrical and feels like most of it is in 3/4 of the 2x2 tiles, leaving the last 1/4 empty. It also feels like the forest and the shepherd are really awkwardly just... There. It feels like a different set - granted a really pretty set, but a different one nonetheless. There's no transition between the cobblestone town and the forest - even in the example image they have to use the normal wild grass tile to transition, when usually they avoid using items not contained in the seasonal set. I loved the Venice set bc it was so well contained - you *could* combine it with the Hollywood set if you had it, but you certainly didn't *need* to. The only thing that was missing was actual people  - which was dirty of them to only have people of you paid, had the diamonds or played STB. But otherwise, perfect set. This feels comparatively quite messy I must say. \n\nAlso absolutely agree that the tram lines feel out of place and most likely will *only* be useful if you pay cash or play STB (pay with your stress levels) to get the matching tram. I am pre-emptively exasperated. \n\nThen again, being Swabian I did hope to see a bit more of a Schwarzwald theme - although saying that a Blackforest theme would probably would be *awesome* for a Halloween theme (instead of generic pumpkins stuff); perhaps include some Brother Grimm fairytale spook - the witch's gingerbread house from Hansel and Gretel, thorn bushes from Sleeping Beauty, an apple tree dripping poison......

If you don't know what I'm on about, some video games will have different characters which have different stats, weaknesses and abilities (strength, speed, Luck, stamina, stealth etc) that CAN change depending on how you play the game - I personally think charts are the same. So your chart will be the initial boost/talent/instinct, but those skills/abilities will strengthen or atrophy as you go through life. A lot of people gravitate towards what they're naturally good at, have an affinity for or enjoy, so those \"base stats\" are most often reinforced and why a lot of charts seem to fit so well - and why in some cases it really does not fit at all if your environment forces you to strengthen certain aspects over other that come more naturally to you. \n\nI understand where the other commenters are coming from with their critiques of astrology, but I also think it tends to get an unnecessarily bad rep. And people get *very* insistent that it's not real and cannot be really. Idk of there's such a thing as agnostic astrology, but that's the camp i fall into haha.

I cannot say that one culture has influenced me more than the other, bc I'd say I had an even exposure to all of them, so my behaviour and beliefs are a mish-mash between all of them. Regardless of how familiar those three cultures are to me, I am always in some way an outsider - even within my own family.

I don't remember a lot of it but one of the things that really stuck out to me was how the author described a pagan - to summarise (and I wish I could quote it directly bc he'd put it so beautifully): the person who performs rituals is a pagan, the person who looks out the window admiring the flowers is a pagan, the farmer who's met the rising sun for 40 years is a pagan, the person who walks and breathes in the mountain air is a pagan. The last three did not have to know of paganism to be pagan, because what made a pagan was someone who had an appreciation and love with nature.\n\nI think about that idea a lot to be honest. If you're finding it hard to make big rituals or ceremonial - really observe your daily habits. What are some things you do without fail? Long before researching witchcraft, I had a specific ritual in place for my bath - specific scents, candles, prep and cleaning before and after, specific music etc. Is that necessarily magical? No. Is it certainly magical in hindsight and I bring a lot of intentionality to it now? Yes. Every morning I prepare my coffee the same way, and I measure out what I put in it - I've changed one of the numbers to mean something personal to me, to make it intentionally magical. I cook almost every day - I cook for someone I love and look after. That's magical - so now I try to wash my dishes twice a day so that the kitchen is always clear to use and try to thank it when I'm done for the day.\n\nLike with any habit, add a new one to an existing one. Make it simple, make it easy, make it fun even! What's joy but a feast to the soul after all?\n\nI hope this rambly answer is of any use to you!

I can look at a person and think they're hot/attractive, but it doesn't mean I want to *fuck them*. This is aesthetic attraction without sexual attraction - for allosexuals (so non-asexuals) I imagine both must seem interchangeable but I think about it like this: a straight man can still look at Ryan Reynolds or Jason Momoa and say \"that's an attractive man\" and not be gay. Because despite finding them aesthetically pleasing, he doesn't want to fuck them, but he can appreciate that they look good. \n\nI find a lot of people aesthetically pleasing, but I do not have the compulsion to fuck them. I guess in a way they don't register as sexual beings to me? It just doesn't cross my mind. I can see someone as pretty/cute/handsome bit it doesn't translate to \"wow I wanna bang them\". \n\nThat being said, I'm personally sex indifferent leaning on sex favourable, so if a person I found aesthetically attractive and with whom I got along said \"Hey I'd like to have sex with you, you down?\" I would probably go \"yeah sure\" because I do enjoy the sensation of sex and orgasms and the whole shebang. So you're absolutely right on the second part!

I hated majority of the people who spoke it, I hated that I HAD to use them, I hated that I was so clumsy in them, I hated that I would SO OFTEN have something to say but couldn't open my jaw because I had no idea how to express my ideas. I hated that I was bullied, belittled, shamed and ridiculed in them, and *resented* that I was expected to still want to learn them. I remember thinking that I must've learnt them through some form of language learning Stockholm Syndrome - like my brain had to just give up, learn it and somehow like it as a defense mechanism  because it couldn't handle the sheer amount of negativity anymore. And even then my level hadn't improved to a good level until I got some actual friends (and better mental health) - and then suddenly I made more progress in a year of those languages than I had in the six years before. \n\nI've used Spanish intermittently since then, in loads of different contexts and various uses (without being belittled or bullied) , and have come to feel overall neutral to it. A useful tool that sounds really cool, at least. Catalan though I haven't used in a decade, apart from one or two small talk conversations and that... Well. Some nice small talk with strangers can't undo how Catalan sometimes makes my metaphorical hackles rise. I'm still going to reconnect with it somehow (trying to find resources rn that I find interesting, but the Catalan Internet is somewhat barren - if anyone knows of any good e-books, YouTubers and podcasts lmk) because time and distance have at least given me an appreciation of it as a language and as a skill of mine. It feels a little like exposure therapy for anxiety - something you just have to meet and confront again and again until it holds less power over you.\n\nLanguages and bullying are wild in combinations with each other.

I detest Anki bc it's interface for flashcard creation is not intuitive for me, and creating the specific flashcards I want is such a time drainer - wanikani solves both of those issues.\n\nHowever, Wanikani has a lot of stuff that really makes progress frustrating. For example, they introduced \u5927 - cool, learnt the mnemonic for big tie dye shirt. Nice. But then they introduce me to its reading \"\u304a\u304a\" which is not a problem except they introduce 2 vocab words at the same time with that reading with very similar pronunciation \u5927\u304d and \u5927\u304d\u3055- which again wouldn't be a problem if the vocab wasn't so damn similar large vs size. Rather than introducing vocab that would cement the reading of \u305f\u3044/\u3060\u3044, they go towards a completely new reading and overwhelm me with vocab where the distinction is minimal. \n\nAnd again this wouldn't be *too* bad if they didn't do this with *multiple other vocab* at the same time. Like \u4e0b and \u4e0a - introduced as themselves, fine, then as to lift or to lower fine, then... \u4e0b\u3055\u3044, huh? Why this one so suddenly? Now \u306e\u307c\u308b? To climb I mean I guess that makes more sense than suddenly \u4e0b\u3055\u3044. Now they're introducing... \u5973? What, they've already introduced this as a radical with the same reading, why does this need introduction? Made sense to introduce its \u3057\u3087 reading - oh wait now they want *this* reading but not that one? That would've been nice to know before getting a fat WRONG for typing the other correct answer of \u304a\u3093\u306a. Maybe an example sentence to work as a hint to which reading they want would've been nice. \n\nIt introduces a lot of different reading and meanings at you without grounding it with context, which is the main issue I have with it. Or they'll introduce a different reading for the kanji without kana there to distinguish it. They make a distinction between radical, Kanji, and vocab which is find unintuitive to think about - and lead to a lot more wrong answers on my part than I find are warranted. Saying \"oh were looking for the on'yomi reading\" frustrates me bc I don't need to know if \u304a\u3093\u306a comes from the butchered Chinese pronunciation or not, because no native content will ask me that - it'll expect me to know from the context of the sentence. So it would be nice if wanikani did that too. \n\nIt's helped a lot with kanji learning but I personally feel like it's showing kanji randomly for the sake of rapid progression instead of comprehensible learning. Just my two cents \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nEdit to add: I think the majority of my niggles with it would be solved if it allowed for a sentence hint - they have those anyway when they first introduce the vocab so they could make it part of their testing. They could probably even have memorable (Japanese) sentences that could act as mnemonics in and of themselves once you become more advanced, but even without that just a hint would be nice rather than having to guess whether they want this reading or that reading based on what the background colour is.", "created_utc": "1653295260.0", "edited": "1653336756.0", "id": "i9nupz6", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_uvnhsh", "parent_id": "t3_uvnhsh", "score": "9", "subreddit": "LearnJapanese", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qyls"}, {"author": "KarmaKeepsMeHumble", "body": "Huh.

On one hand, it is an easy and fun introduction to a language, it can be very useful for (particularly neurodivergent) people to get into a language learning habit, and I think overall it sends the important message of \"it's more important to do something everyday instead of doing a lot in a single day.\" On the other hand, there's generally a lack of actually *doing* anything with the language, a lot of them fail in teaching grammar points in any meaningful way, and I've yet to see a language learning game that goes beyond A1/A2 level. So yeah, I'm definitely mixed on that point.\n\nThe second point I'm not really sure how to respond, but my first instinct would be to say that it depends on what you want out of the language. If your goal is to talk/write with other people, then yeah I agree those apps do you a disservice bc they remove the human element. However, if you're just wanting to learn a language bc of the content then I think those apps are created for your demographic. Plus, like I mentioned, a lot of game apps don't really go beyond A2 that I've seen - and you aren't really ABLE to have much meaningful output at that point.\n\nRegarding the last point - the Japanese language learning community is, in general, an absolutely awful language learning environment. I do think that there is a lot of merit in their fixation on immersion, but I believe why their output is so little is bc of this perversive idea of perfection within the community. If you don't know the pitch accent of every word you want to say, if you're unsure about a grammar point, if you don't know the 1000 most used kanji by heart yet - don't even bother. They're so terrified of \"getting bad habits\" that most never really go beyond their textbooks, sentence mining, Anki decks - talk about removing the human element of language learning.

AQA is the exam board/company making the tests, GCSEs is the name of the particular examination taken at those ages. Anyway if you know the name of exam boards/companies you can Google them and usually they have past papers on there, plus the mask scheme used by examiners to correct it. They're far, FAR from perfect and I personally detested them as someone fluent/native, but its a different thing for learners I'd imagine. So that could be one avenue.\n\nIf you want to more generally practice writing, search for a prompt generator. There's a ton out there for writers, and they're useful if you just want to practice something quick. You could then check it with a grammar checker of some sort. Based on a quick look, spanishchecker.com seems to be alright and will give you okay feedback. Once you have a rudimentary grasp on grammar and some vocab under your belt, you'll be surprised how quick you can advance in a language purely through reading, writing and checking general mistakes through Word or a checker online. \n\nPolygloss is a good app that gives you 4 images where you can choose 1 to describe and send it off to another person.

I go in phases of being interested in various games - depends on how much escapism I need at the time. And also because my mother disapproved my love of video games, so all my childhood games were either hand me downs, gifts and whatever I could scrape together from holiday money. So most of my favourite games come from hand held devices - Nintendo DS and 3DS were my jam, I'm so sad that they're old news now.\n\nAs a result, a lot of my favourites were Nintendo games - Pokemon chief among them, both the main line as well as Mystery Dungeon and pokemon ranger (Shadows of Almia is my favourite game ever and I play it whenever I get overwhelmingly stressed). Not a fan of the more recent titles though, which is a shame. Loved Animal Crossing on the DS as well as New Leaf (tried New Horizons through a friend's switch, didn't like it as much as NL). Harvest Moon was great in its various iterations on the DS consoles. The only other game I'm remembering rn is the Sims game on DS which was honestly a really awful fucking game haha. Saying that, the PS2 Sims was alright, and Castaways was really fun - but far inferior to the main title on PC that I got to play through a friend at the time. I would love to get into it but EA is the epitomy of everything I hate about the gaming industry, and I refuse give them 100 quid just to get the complete experience of Sims 4. Its extortion and honestly just fucking annoying. And I'm too weary to really give piracy a go when it comes to a big game like that, so I won't be trying it again any time soon. A shame since I also liked the decorating part a lot more than I did the Sims parts haha. \n\nNowadays I've somewhat gotten into Steam gaming but I find it hard to get into it as much since its now as convenient as a handheld or a console to just switch on and play s(my laptop is old and slowing down now). But my favourite on there is Stardew Valley without a doubt - I always get every Bachelor(rette) to 10 hearts and then marry Elliot anyway lol. Really excited to see what ConcernedApe's Haunted Chocolatier is gonna be like!\n\nI've been playing a little of The Witcher because of the show, and I enjoy it a lot but find some of it really frustrating to deal with (tbf though it is a pretty old game at this point). Plan on finishing it so I can play 2 and 3 as well, but I'm not in a hurry tbh since my laptop probs wouldn't be able to run 2 all that well anyway.\n\nAlso been trying Persona 3 Golden but that's going slooooow. Wow that game takes so long to get anywhere. Also have some other cr\u00edtiques but this comment is getting way too long lmao.\n\nAnyone feel free to chime in about any of these games, I never really get to talk about them with anyone lol.\n\nEdit: also! Various phone games - went through a phase of absolutely loving phone games. Some really fun ones out there, but currently really into June's Journey. It's a game set in the 1920s where you play as June, who's a female detective travelling around the world solving mysteries and murders. The game play is basically a \"spot the object\" in a picture, although there are some other game plays. But the main draw of the game imo is that you get an island to decorate - every month there's a different theme for decorations available for the month, and they're fun to collect and decorate the island with.

Heat pan on high, add spices to bloom for a couple of seconds, add tin of tomato, then add drained tin of chickpeas, let it simmer for 45 mins if you're fancy. Eat with rice. Easy to add other tinned beans, frozen veggies (my go-to was peas), mushrooms and whatever else you had the space, time or mental capacity for. But basically just spices, tomato and chickpeas with rice. It was basically all that I ate for a couple of months because it was easy quick and barely made any dishes. You could probably even cook rice in there but I'd never tried that so idk. \n\nI've found a lot of pantry/shelf-stable staples since then that I'd wished I'd known about then.\n\nTVP soy has been a godsent (texturised vegan protein), basically dehydrated soy. You can get it in various sizes (chunks, slices, mince), but having minced on hand is super useful because essentially you just have to add the mince into a metal bowl, add spices (Cumin, pepper, soy sauce, some umami flavour if fancy) and add boiling water to it. Cover and wait for 10 minutes or so until all the water is absorbed. Voila you can eat as is or add it to any dish that'd have normal meat mince. Good way to have a good protein source in the house.\n\nCh\u00eda seeds with which you can make chia pudding (mix that pudding with some powdered peanut butter and it really resembles the consistency of custard), or use as a replacement for eggs in a recipe if you run out of eggs.\n\nCouscous is similar to TVP mince in that all you need is some seasonings, boiling water and 10min until you the final product. Super cheap and easy carb source - add some steamed greens or chopped peppers, olive oil, balsamic vinegar and a bean/pulse (white beans and chickpeas are great) and you've got well-rounded, high volume low calorie dish (if you watch out for the oil).\n\nYou can get a lot of vegetable proteins in tins/cardboard that keep for a long time and are precooked so you do not have to soak them beforehand or really cook them for long. Kidney beans, white beans, chickpeas, lentils of every sort can survive for a long time so you don't have to worry about them going off like with meat (which was always my biggest annoyance when I was in the ditch).\n\nNori sheets are a great crunchy/crispy snack to just mindlessly munch on. Bit expensive, but they help so much when I'm in a \"i just need to do something with my mouth and hands\" mood.\n\nIf you want a healthier alternative to cereal, puffed rice is a great way to do it. Speaking of cereal, you can get powder milk that you can mix with water to make milk, so making the portion you need rather than buying fresh milk (which would always go off for me before I'd finish it).\n\nSauerkraut in a jar is a really good low calorie high volume healthy food. Super easy to spice up or just eat straight out of the jar depending on how you're feeling. Pickled jalape\u00f1os are a life saver if you want something spicy (you can use the pickle juice in various recipes to add a bit of spice but nothing too intense).\n\nYou can freeze some herbs like thyme and rosemary so you can have them on hand to easily add to dishes. You can freeze toast bread too and take our slices as and when you want them - add either to a toaster, an air fryer or just on a frying pan to defrost and crisp a little. Frozen berries are also fantastic to have - if you get quick oats you can cook them in the microwave and once cooked, add frozen berries, yeet for another minute or two and you've got a good breakfast.

Unfortunately (for me then), like you, I am someone who hates spending money on restaurants/fast food/deli, so my genius idea was to just not eat anything, as much as possible :/ I wasn't in the best headspace at the time. \n\nHowever, 9-10 months ago I became a live-in carer again, and my responsibilities widened to cooking since my person's disabilities had gotten worse and I wanted to lose weight. So I needed to take control of the kitchen - and I had no other responsibilities that were precisely planned. So I had the time, space and motivation to develop my cooking, and I've become really, *really* good at it. I've even come to really love it now - I enjoy finding new recipes online and adjusting them to what I have, and the more I learn the less I enjoy spending money on premade stuff. I've made my own pesto, guacamole, bao zi, ramen, stock, broth, salsa and loads of different dips - hell, I even made my own *ham* because the price of a back of 12 slices cost too damn much.\n\nThat being said, I hope that I'll be able to carry that attitude into the rest of my life once I'm back into the normal workforce. I'm somewhat afraid mental health and a lack of spoons could get in the way of that, but I'm hoping I've developed a deep enough love with cooking to find it a pleasant activity rather than a chore.\n\nAny tips or resources on meal prepping and/or bulk cooking I'd be interested to hear!", "created_utc": "1649200528.0", "edited": "False", "id": "i3k0lf5", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_twaxxo", "parent_id": "t3_twaxxo", "score": "1", "subreddit": "CasualConversation", "subreddit_id": "t5_323oy"}, {"author": "KarmaKeepsMeHumble", "body": "Me too, tbh!

I mean absolutely rabid, every video of first impressions/reviews/anti-hauls/new releases that even mentioned anything negative about her brand would have her fans in the comments defending the brand with the line \"it's MeAnt FOr DiSABleD PEopLe\".\n\nI think thereafter it was simply good timing because it hit the sweet spot in terms of trends - the dewy, easy makeup look that's mostly creams and liquids.\n\nMy interest in the brand personally is in the negative numbers. I hate the dewy look, hate liquid and cream products, and detest brands that are primarily celeb-focused - so that's three for three and I'm not checking the brand lol.", "created_utc": "1647996118.0", "edited": "False", "id": "i1qhw3n", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_tkdf15", "parent_id": "t3_tkdf15", "score": "-6", "subreddit": "BeautyGuruChatter", "subreddit_id": "t5_3jayp"}, {"author": "KarmaKeepsMeHumble", "body": "This is the part that pisses me off the most about YouTube - like yeah, okay, a dick move to censor so much shit anyway, but whatever, their platform their rules.

And that's just from a genre standpoint (which will influence what type of vocab and grammar you learn) - the actual gameplay of a video game will influence how you interact with it.\n\nFor example, in MMO (massive multiplayer online) games like World of Warcraft you generally have to interact with other players to  be able to accomplish certain goals. This is generally done through chats, but some multilayer games have you speaking in a mic. So you're practicing both your comprehension as well as output in real time - of course, this would probably be more enjoyable if you're a bit further along in language learning, but I have seen some YouTubers go on Japanese servers and get by with rudimentary one to two word communication. I personally don't play these types of games, but I've heard from others that they made some long lasting friendships by meeting through games like these. \n\nThat being said, what if you don't like the thought of talking to others or playing with others? Well then you can have a look at adventure games like The Witcher or Skyrim - you go exploring and talk to various non-playable characters that are voiced by fluent actors. Again you're testing your comprehension, as well as familiarising yourself with proper pronunciation and cadence of a language. Also a lot of dialogue tends to repeat itself or be unintentionally funny and help with vocab retention (eg Skyrim has the line \"I used to be an adventurer like you, but then I took an arrow to the knee\" - voila you have a grammatical structure and some interesting vocab all in one funny line). Slight downfall would be that a lot of adventure games that I know of have a fantasy setting, but you'd have that problem with fantasy books too, and you can find games that have voice actors that aren't set in medieval fantasy (think Grand Theft Auto,maybe) - but I personally love the fantasy genre so those are the games I'm most familiar with. \n\nOkay, but what if your computer doesn't run those types of games very well, and you can only access games with written text? Well then it's very similar to normal books, except you get immediate feedback as to whether your reading comprehension is up to snuff!\n\nHerein lies my favourite type of game - slice of life and RPGs (role-playing games), like Animal Crossing, Harvest Moon, Stardew Valley and Pokemon. A lot of these types of games will teach you useful everyday vocab - especially games like Stardew Valley where you learn and reinforce the names of a lot of produce, animals and plants. Where a lot of adventure games and MMOs can teach very specific vocab (eg sword, mace, gun, bullets, tavern), slice of life/RPGs tend to be more general and useful. Also these types of games are very low stakes and slow paced so you can take your time reading, looking up words etc. But it still makes it very clear whether you understood the reading or not based on whether you can complete the objective(s) the game gives you. Slight negative would be that reading a language on an unfamiliar alphabet is not that fun (but would perhaps make adventure games and MMOs more useful in the beginning).\n\nTo conclude I would say that video games have three aspects that make them great language learning tools: they're varied in both genre and gameplay, they force you to be an active participant in the language rather than just passive input and they're accessible a cross a variety of platforms nowadays (phones, computer, laptop, portable console like DS or PSP, stationary console like XBox).\n\nI don't think it's the perfect tool out there by any means, but I do think that it can be an incredibly useful and powerful tool if you know how to leverage it. I think if someone is already a gamer then not using it as a language tool is a bit of a waste imo, in the same way that a reader not using books as a tool is a bit of a waste.", "created_utc": "1647964337.0", "edited": "False", "id": "i1oafa5", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_tjuqpc", "parent_id": "t3_tjuqpc", "score": "4", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "KarmaKeepsMeHumble", "body": "Ooh, I'm curious what formula they have because the duochromes I have from them are two distinct formulas - one half is very smooth and \"oily\" whilst the other half is very chunky and almost like a pressed glitter.

I was also salty because his products did not live up to the hype for me either.\n\n- speaking of which, any beauty influencer/celebrity brand - because of the above, I'm convinced that you can never actually know if people are genuine about the quality of a celebrity makeup brand bc they'll love it just for the name. I even side-eye Fenty a little because the original foundation was praised to high heaven, but then when the moisturising version came out only then did people admit they hadn't liked it. And even regardless of all of that, eventually something from their past gets revealed and I've already been burned once. So yeah: Fenty, JH cosmetics, EM cosmetics, Rare Beauty, Trixie Cosmetics etc are all off my list.\n\n- I avoid fast makeup brands like Colourpop and Revolution whenever possible - I rarely if ever buy fast fashion, and I do the same with fast makeup. The rapid pollution, waste and exploitation is hard for me to stomach/justify just because I want some cheap makeup. I do still buy drugstore stuff, but not from brands that churn out a new product everytime the CEO has a piss.\n\n- I avoid brands with consistent issues with shade ranges - mainly talking about Hourglass here, but I'm also talking about Beauty Blender and actually most boujie makeup lines (Estee Lauder etc). This includes blush and bronzers too btw - not just foundation - even thought I do not use bronzers and rarely if ever use foundation. I find often that even if their foundation range is decent, they tend to lack in the other face product department. I am furious with the lack of inclusivity in most brands, and imo if a brand doesn't care to include darker shade ranges they're not gonna care if those consumers boycott them. Their targeted demographic (ie where they get most of their money from, ie light shade range people) must also boycott them to make them listen. I'm not always perfect with this, but whenever I realise a brand is usually bad with shade ranges I tend to just avoid them from then on and try not to buy from their makeup catalogue. I'm not sure where I stand on Korean/Asian makeup brands with their shade range issues since their demographic is likely to buy too-pale makeup regardless due to the beauty standard there, but I haven't had to think about it really since most of their makeup doesn't appeal to me (not a fan of dewy or brown/neutral looks). I tend to be more forgiving with indie brands where I can understand having big jumps between shades due to their small size, but I will side-eye if I find the distribution to be unequal (example: 3 really light shades, 2 middle shades and 1 sorta dark - I understand if there are significant jumps between the light, middle and dark, but have it at least 2 for each if you only have the money for 6 shades sort of deal). But established big brands do not have an excuse in my eyes. \n\n- I avoid Two Faced as well as ABH for their various controversies. Juvia's Place imo is not as bad as those two with their controversies, but they're public image has been pretty messy for a while now due to their CEO and I really don't like the attitude/lack of professionalism.\n\n- I had boycotted KVD, but had purchased 2 items after she left. I'm not that fussed about the lack of name change (I understand how much of a marketing nightmare it would be to completely change), although their various fumblings to make the initials work have been hilarious.\n\nAs for a cosmetic brand I wholeheartedly support? Lethal Cosmetics. Their entire business ethic is to create as little waste as possible, plus their commitment to use ethical mica has endeared them to me a lot. They're cruelty free and vegan (I'm not either of those things, although I do try to buy that kind of makeup as much as I can), and have a whole section of their site dedicated to their ethics and how they align their business practices with those ethics. I find the markup on makeup infuriating, but find their prices fair because, well, to be ethical means you have to often pay more. Imo they're the best example of an ethical makeup brand (as much as any brand CAN be ethical under neoliberal capitalism). \n\nThat's all I can think of atm.", "created_utc": "1646220901.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hz1d1wn", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_t4rjmv", "parent_id": "t3_t4rjmv", "score": "11", "subreddit": "BeautyGuruChatter", "subreddit_id": "t5_3jayp"}, {"author": "KarmaKeepsMeHumble", "body": "Ooh im gonna have fun looking through your dictionary in more detail later!

There's an absolutely fantastic recipe I've been making lately where after salting and pepper-ing a butterflied chicken thigh I cover it in seasoned flour (can add whatever you want like curry powder if you want it easy - I use Cumin, a little ground cloves and some Chinese 5 spice. Make sure flour changes colour slightly, otherwise it isn't spiced enough). Heat goose or chicken fat in a pan on medium head, put chicken in skin side down. Cook both sides 2-3 minutes each until golden (some small spots can be brown but you have to flip it/take it out otherwise you might overcook). Set aside and cover with tin foil or a lid. Whilst it rests. Add shaoshing wine to deglaze, some will immediately evaporate, boil for a little while, add chicken stock. Leave to reduce for a while. Turn down the heat as low as possible and wait until the liquid doesn't bubble anymore, then add single cream. Mix, add seasoning (great time to add MSG, some more pepper and/or salt if needed). Return chicken into the sauce (the chicken will have some fat/oil it released on the plate/tin foil - ADD THAT TO THE SAUCE and mix it all together). Bam, some carb and some steamed  veggies and you've got a damn masterpiece of a meal. Chicken is butter soft and flavourful, sauce is to die for. Also very calorie intense, but so good.\n\n- add sesame oil as a seasoning. Got rice? Add sesame oil after cooking. Savoury porridge? Sesame oil. Egg noddles? Sesame oil. Wakame salad? Sesame oil. Great seasoning and an easy extra calories.\n\n- coconut oil in hot milky drinks like coffee, golden milk latte, rooibus tea etc.\n\n- use glutinous rice (sushi rice) instead of long grain rice. Even if you don't use it to make sushi or onigiri or whatever, it has this really nice soft, creamy texture when combined with a saucy meal like curry and goulash - due to the starch in it it will make any sauce thicker and creamier. Depending on how thick and creamy the sauce is from the get go, you can get something close to a risotto texture with little technical difficulty.\n\n- to sort a add on to glutinous rice - rice paper, mochi and any Asian snacks made with glutinous rice flour tend to be higher calories and not be too unhealthy. \n\n- if you eat fish, go for fatty cuts like salmon instead of tuna.\n\n- multi seed bread is a good way to do it.\n\n- most cheeses.\n\n\nThis is just off the top of my head what you could do.

I've never come across another person with that combo, how very nice to meet you.\n\nBack to the discussion of Youtuber Polyglots though - I could be mistaken, but all Polyglots I've ever come across on YouTube were English speakers that learnt languages later on in life, ie they grew up monolingual, and I personally theorise that this is the reason they grossly misrepresent their language levels. \n\nIn my experience, people who grow up multilingual are very aware of their shortcomings in another language, whether because their child peers would be very direct about it (which most adults are too polite to mention if you only fuck up a little on pronunciation etc) or because they would notice how their language levels varied with each language and with each aspect of every language.

It's easier to overestimate your own language level when you don't know how MUCH there is to another language, and what it REALLY means to be completely fluent in another language.

Mind you I haven't watched the whole thing but I've watched enough that I'm fairly certain that I know what he's on about. It's just a bit unfortunate because to understand what he's talking about one needs to have a basic understanding of Anthropological theory to understand the concepts he is talking about (I guess my degree is useful for something!). Even then a lot of anthropology students have a hard time grasping it, and tbh they're really tricky concepts to explain.\n\nBTW I'm not railing on you or anything, just trying to explain a bit more what OP, and the guy they're referencing, is talking about here, for anyone interested. \n\nAt its most basic, what he's trying to say is exactly what you describe in your second paragraph. You're born Autistic, and those traits are not conditioned by society. However, you're misinterpreting what he's describing as the \"concept\".\n\nHe's basically saying, the word for \"autism\" didn't even exist 100 odd years ago. It is with the rise of several disciplines like psychology and psychiatry that the term has come about (the word discipline, in itself, denoting order and configuration) - and with it, came ideas of what autism is and what it isn't. One such example being that autism is only in boys, and that it looks like a child screeching in the corner whacking his head (not his description, BTW, that's mine based on what my conception of autism was). Everything you associate with the word \"autism\" is part of its concept, and thereby a view into what the society around you views autism as. \n\nHe's saying that whether or not his daughter is diagnosed as Autistic (because he says \"she self-identifies as autistic\") she will always be dealing with sensory issues and have some learning difficulties. However the label (and the concepts associated with said label) brings with it certain expectations, and any person who hears that label in associated with her will have certain ideas of what she's like and how she'll behave.\n\nAnd here's the really tricky bit to explain - essentially, he's drawing on Foucault's work, who wrote about how the concept of \"whiteness\" affected how people perceived and interacted with his \"blackness\", but is basically applicable to anything involving words. He essentially proposed that words were a form of knowledge, which were power - in terms of knowledge being *powerful*, yes, but more importantly that knowledge is formed and changed by *power*. In other words, the power of the majority, of the rich, of the influential. In academia this creates a cycle - the creation of knowledge means those learning become more powerful, who in turn will create more knowledge. Here we come back to how autism is an institution - because in the West it is inseparably linked with the idea of psychology, psychiatry, the organising of the human experience into quantitative (or listical) experience. (im adding my own 2 cents for the rest of the paragraph) And this is not an automatically positive cycle - the whole \"vaccines cause autism\" debacle is still felt to this day. That study was a pretty blatant and unethical \"creation of knowledge\" due to the manipulation of the sample and data, but that's part of what he's saying I think, or at least how I'm taking it, because science is not objective and infallible, it is subject to human error and (more troubling) human motives. \n\nHe's not denying autism, rather he's trying to call to attention that the word \"autism\" has a lot of connotations to it which are intrinsically linked with institutions and their motives, and not really to out benefit. And that most cannot really see past that because they have never come into close enough contact with a different culture that does not conceptualise it the same way (ie not as western influenced, like a lot of Africa and Asia), and its all they know. The symptoms and difficulties remain the same, but how those symptoms are perceived and (more importantly) interacted with is incredibly culturally determined.", "created_utc": "1643668752.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hv20r71", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_sh2kcb", "parent_id": "t1_huzzt3n", "score": "5", "subreddit": "AutismInWomen", "subreddit_id": "t5_3yx96k"}, {"author": "KarmaKeepsMeHumble", "body": "Do you have a link?

Bodybuilders are not people one should use as a measure of health, nor see as a reasonable example for muscle gain. First of all, their main focus is *building muscle* - they optimise everything in their life and control every single minutiae of their lives to be stage ready. Second, bodybuilders are *notorious* for taking steroids and other enhancement drugs - AFAIK there's no official oversight over PD use in the sport, or at the very least its very loose. And enhancement drugs will give you results *in spite* of your shit diet, workout routine, lack of sleep, calorie deficit etc. You can get far in bodybuilding with steroids, you become the top 10% with steroids and an optimised workout and diet. Regardless of anything do, bodybuilders should rarely be looked at as inspiration for *healthy and consistent* physical wellness, because the sport is rife with PD use, extreme dieting before competition followed by binging after the competition and extreme control over diet which does not allow for much wiggle room - which a lot of body builders themselves will admit. They're an extreme example of muscle gain, and shouldn't be emulated (even though I personally admire the self control it takes). \n\n2. R/keto is primarily focused on using keto as a weight loss tactic - which it certainly can be, and to great success (because it helps reduce overall calorie intake, which therefore means weight loss) , but usually to the detriment of muscle *which can be mitigates to a certain extent if they train, but not entirely* (I'll explain why in point 4). Also you are making the statement that keto redditors gaining muscle is over 2 million - that's a number you're pulling out of thin air, since you're basing that on the keto subreddit which, again, is not focused on muscle gain but *weight loss*. Even the subreddit r/ketogains has a post saying how OP *has* to take carbs before a workout because they notice how much better their performance is when they intake carbohydrates. \n\n3. Those are all individual accounts - I'm talking about actual scientific *studies* here. Extensive research as well as various meta analysis papers which document that keto is a sub-optimal diet for building muscle. The results found in these studies will apply to the majority of people, excepting extenuating circumstances. I'm not saying you *can't ever* perform well in resistance training whilst on keto, but the likelihood is you would perform *better* if you weren't on a diet that restricts an entire food group. \n\n4. There are 3 types of people who can rapidly gain muscle mass in a short period of time: 1} new lifters, 2} returning lifters (after an injury or just not lifting for a long period of time) and 3} enhancement drug users. My guess would be that most people in r/keto and r/ketogains would most likely fall in one of those 3 categories. So yes, if you do keto and do strength training, you will see gains, however if you do keto you *will lose muscle*. This video (https://youtu.be/fGMqC7XmR5k) looks at a meta analysis (essentially a big study summarising and comparing the results of smaller studies looking at the same thing - it is the highest form of scientific evidence one can have) which compares how body composition differs in people who do keto and people who don't, but both groups resistance train. Those doing keto lost weight, but *almost half of that weight was in lean body mass*. Now, Dr. Norton goes through a couple of reasons why that might be, but in my personal opinion trying to figure out how the body works and gains muscle is hard enough to figure out without throwing in random variables just for shits and giggles (*disclaimer below regarding exceptions) that affect your performance and muck around with your lean body mass.\n\n(*disclaimer: some people need to go on keto for medical reasons, which is a fair point and of course arguing about the optimal muscle gain/retention does nothing if carbs are genuinely affecting your overall physical health. Most people, however, do not fall into this category and the whole time I've been writing it is under the assumption that anyone who has to fo keto for medical reasons is obviously exempt)\n\n5. Of course carbs are an essential nutrient - the humans body prefers carbs over any other energy source, not to mention the fact that if you want to absorb any nutrients outside of those found in meat protein, you *need* to eat plants. Plants are, may I remind you, largely full of carbohydrates (excepting of course seeds, olives and such, but even those have carbs) - starchy veggies, leaves etc. Sure, *technically* there's no essential carb, but practically? To remove an entire food group and thereby removing a lot of nutrient sources (and sources of other goodies such as antioxidants etc) is foolish in my opinion (again exempting medical reasons).\n\nI think it's fair enough if you want to try out the keto diet for a little while - I've used it for a week to remove simple carbs for a while and force me to focus on my protein and fat sources, and not fall so easily into eating packaged junk food. Plus, for a lot of people who are on the US diet of fast and junk food, the keto diet will be a *huge* improvement on their health one way or the other. From a long-term standpoint however, it is bound to make things difficult for no real discernable reason. Is it the worst diet on the world? No. Will it cause you to die? Very unlikely. Could you develop good, healthy habits following a keto diet? Sure. Can you build muscle? Sure. Will it be optimal? No. Will it bring you optimal weight loss results? Depends on your view of optimal, but in my perspective of optimal = maximum fat loss and minimal lean body mass loss, then NO. \n\nIt has its benefits from a behavioural standpoint, and I can appreciate what it can do for people, but from a physiological standpoint? The science so far has been pretty clear on the effects of the keto diet and how it is not an ideal diet long term for the vast majority of people. Much better (and easier and cheaper in my experience) to have a balanced diet including all of the macronutrient and trying to fulfill your daily micronutrient requirements.", "created_utc": "1643152828.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hu7xvk2", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_sc4elp", "parent_id": "t1_hu6485i", "score": "4", "subreddit": "AutismInWomen", "subreddit_id": "t5_3yx96k"}, {"author": "KarmaKeepsMeHumble", "body": "Hmm, I cannot exactly remember how it works, the only thing I remember is that the scientist who looked at the relationship between keto and muscle mass was a pretty stout keto follower but stopped doing keto because of how keto affected the muscle.

So I can't confidently state whether or not keto *inherently* causes muscle loss, I just remember that it negatively affects the muscle in some sort of way. \n\nWhat I do know for sure is that a keto diet negatively affects performance and worsens time to exhaustion, because muscles need glycogen to have energy for a work out.

Warm them up in the microwave or crisp them a bit in a pan (doesn't even necessarily need oil - although it helps spices stick to it if you want those). Depending on the energy levels you have, some yoghurt with tabasco, salt and smoked paprika makes for a more liquid, easy to swallow meal that's tasty. Open a can of tuna if you need some extra protein (plus that sweet sweet omega 3 - this also works as a standalone snack).\n\n- instead of munching on crisps, munch on spinach leaves as if they are crisps. Not as crunchy, but a good, mindless \"I need something for my mouth and hands to do\" replacement.\n\n- egg noodles - they require some prep in hot water, but otherwise are quick and easy. Add some soy sauce, sesame oil, any veggies or meat you have left over in the fridge - boom, good meal.\n\n- soy mince - it's dehydrated soy that can be easily dehydrated by soaking it in water. You add dry and liquid seasoning and it'll taste really good. Has fiber and protein, which is a rare combo. Super easy way to get protein if you have no meat, fish or egg. Great topping on anything.\n\n- Eggs! Sunny side up egg is literally the easiest thing, if you want to make it filling find a carb to pair it with (ie plain bread) and it should carry you for an hour or two.\n\n- protein bars - get yourself a 12 pack on amazon (a lot cheaper than getting it individually) and by god will you have a life saver. Just look out that they're not just filled with carbs/oats/nuts - those tend to be very high calorie but help very little with filling you up. I love the protein bars from Amfit - together with a banana it's a really great quick breakfast option for me when I cannot stand having to do anything.\n\n- popcorn - get some kernels, not the prepacked stuff, and make them in a pan - doesn't require oil to pop, but ideally you want an oil spray at the end to coat the popcorn light for seasoning to stick. \n\n\nSome advice with regards to losing weight (I managed to lose 7kg/14lbs-ish and maintained the loss for 8 months now - it was/is a special interest):\n\n- always make sure you have a combo of protein, carbs and fats in a meal (even if it's small) because that satisfies the body/brain and is the most filling combo\n\n- prioritise protein as much as possible - it is the most filling of the macronutrients and the one with the highest thermogenic effect (ie it takes more energy [calories] for the body to break down protein). Plus being in a calorie deficit causes you to lose muscle as well as fat - which is bad because muscle burns a lot more calories to maintain than fat. Most people get in a cycle of losing weight losing equal amount of fat and muscle, but regain the weight almost entirely in fat - the fat to muscle ratio is screwed and a lot more unhealthy than when you started. Taking in enough protein mitigates some of the muscle loss (you cannot fully stop the loss of muscle, but you can make it less and prioritise fat loss). Best would be to pair it with some strength training, so you could even gain more muscle instead of losing it, through stuff like bodyweight exercises (push ups, pull ups, dips, squats), weightlifting or bands. Protein powder is a godsend because it means I can have a protein snack that's sweet (other option is popcorn or protein bar). \n\n- some stuff that causes rapid muscle loss: a keto diet, having to steep of a calorie deficit, too much cardio, not intaking enough protein. Avoid doing any of these.\n\n- sleep enough - not getting enough sleep increases the hunger hormone, and surpresses the hormone of self-control (iirc - could have also been that the body produces less of the satiety hormone).\n\n\nHope this helps, best of luck!", "created_utc": "1643124490.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hu5v538", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_sc4elp", "parent_id": "t3_sc4elp", "score": "3", "subreddit": "AutismInWomen", "subreddit_id": "t5_3yx96k"}, {"author": "KarmaKeepsMeHumble", "body": "Japanese - it's a beautiful language, but my god is it complicated grammatically.

Context for this album is basically the musician detailing his grief over losing his wife (I think it was cancer?), and very little of it is metaphorical really - a lot of it is just raw pain. It's music, but only in the barest sense of the word. The first time I heard Seaweed (2nd song) I had one of those silent, tears-streaming-into-the-mouth type of cry. All the songs are gut punches, but that one was especially hard. Seriously, lie down in a dark room, close your eyes and only listen to the lyrics and your heartbeat, nothing else. \n\n- Squid game (series) - majority of it is brutal and not *really* sad (although there are definitely sad moments, don't get me wrong), but one episode in particular is absolutely devastating in its execution. I watched it with someone and we had to be in physical contact because I was just bawling for 3/4th of that episode (which usually NEVER happens when another person is present, due to past issues, but I literally couldn't help myself). The finale was almost underwhelming because of how that episode chewed and spat me out. \n\n- Million Dollar Baby - this movie was the first piece of media to get me to cry. Starts out really hopeful and nice, gets depressing, and then just bittersweet with an emphasis on bitter.\n\n\nI sympathise with you, it sucks to lose the ability to cry and to find yourself without a healthy release of emotion.

And then I was like \"you typed out this much already, might as well finish splattering your openions all over Reddit's metaphorical dinnertable.\" Hope someone has fun with this! \n\nFor a long while I was really into phone games that one could play online. Here are a couple:\n\n- classic Sodoku\n- Bonza Planet (love this one, mix between scrabble and crosswords - youre given a theme and a whole bunch of grouped words, and they all fit together in one bit piece that looks like a crosswords. They have a national geographic themed one too)\n- Two Eyes (nonograms - spatial numbers is the best way I can think of it rn - has a story that you unlock with every level, a bit finicky though because where you have to click gets reeeeally tiny. Still a fun brain teaser tho)\n- I have an Android so I have a Gameboy Advance adaptor app - I have 2 pokemon games on there, but you can add any GB and GBA game on there. For those that don't want to buy a GBA and their games. \n- Flutter: Butterfly Sanctuary. Doesn't really have game play, per se, but it is a fun nonetheless. You basically raise butterflies - you unlock new subspecies as you expand your sanctuary, each species page has multiple parts that unlock the more of that species you gather where you can learn about that species. The knowledge and design is accurate to real life - I had a weird moment for a while where I got pretty dang good at recognising loads of different butterflies. The only problem is the waiting, which is what did it in for me in the end - would check on it once every 3 days or so bc that's how long it would take haha. But a calming game for sure. \n\nOne phone game that you have to connect to the Internet for is June's Journey - main gameplay is a mix between memory test and decorating. Has a storyline you steadily unlock throughout every level, set in the 1920s-ish, a lot more diverse than expected. Can get a bit stressful thought if you get interested in the contests and leader board, but that's 100% optional.\n\nLet's see... Ooh yeah Stardew Valley has a mobile version! I play the PC version, but heard the mobiles good - one of my all time favourite games, super chill and adorable. Loads to do, and it's left up to you how fast/slow you want to play for the most part. \n\nNintendo 3DS/DS lite:\n\n - Pokemon rangers shadows of Almia\n- omg i loooove this game. The writing is just so charming and marvelously ridiculous, it's just so cute and pleasant to look at. I don't know how it would stand up to a game critic, but this is my #1 game that I go to when feeling stressed. This is my happy place. \n- Basically all pokemon games. Pokemon Diamind/Pearl have a special place in my heart. \n- actually, throw the original Pokemon Dungeon Explorers in there too, wth not, i think at this points it's become obvious that I am a pokemon fan. My favoutire was Team Red/Blue - the sequels of Explorers of Time were also fun, but there comes a point where the game's difficulty just suddenly spikes and a game is ni longer relaxing when you're stuck at a section for days!\n- Animal Crossing, of course. First game I ever bought, ever, and it was worth it. Love this series so much. Obviously during the Pandemic they released Horizons, which is available on the Switch - it's a good game, as relaxing as it's predecessors, although I personally liked it less than New Leaf. \n\nThat's all the ones I can think of off the top of my head.

In it, he has passed on his farm to you, near the town of Stardew Valley. You meet two of the inhabitants, and from there your game begins!\n\nFrom there, you can largely play it however you want to - there are a bunch of different activities you can do in-game that it becomes a little overwhelming at times. At the beginning, you can pretty much just clean up your farm, plant and water crops, and get to know the villagers in the town. All villagers have different likes, dislikes, schedules and stories. Eventually, you'll be able to fish and mine. There are also goals that help you find new areas to explore and find new resources. You can do as much or as little as you want to with each activity, it's really customisable.\n\nYou can just stick to growing crops, or eventually you can get a variety of different animals to raise alongside or without crops. You can ignore the villagers if you really want to, but befriending them will unlock a lot of different items you wouldn't otherwise. With a lot of them, you'll unlock cutscenes that will tell you about their backstories. Twelve of those villagers - six bachelorettes, six bachelors - you can romance (regardless of player sex) if you so fancy, and eventually marry and live with on your farm. You can mine for resources, or gather enough money to buy the materials without ever stepping a foot in it. It's really up to you as to how you want to play it. \n\nOverall, it's just really chill. It's not really \"about\" anything, it's pretty much the definition of \"it's about the journey, not the destination\". For the vast majority of the game, there is no countdown for getting anything done at a specific point - you can play as slowly or as quickly as you want to. Some get really into decorating the farm and the rest of the town, some people really enjoy min-maxing income, some enjoy the combat, others the fishing, a lot of people just enjoy the exploration and meeting the villagers.\n\nI've started around 6 different save files where I played differently in every one.

What am I doing subconsciously that could constitute as that?\n\nFor example, something I do every day is cook. Sometimes it's more involved (doing the whole dish by hand, very little processed), sometimes it's less so (today I just air fryed some toast with sliced cheese and put a fried egg on top), but nonetheless it's something I do every day. My aim is to make it as balanced of a diet as I can, but I don't get gung-ho about it. \n\nThis practice nourishes my body (the food), it nourishes my mind (the skill of cooking), and by virtue of it nourishing those it nourishes my soul (especially because my cooking also nourishes another person majority of the time) - is that not a form of magic? And if so, does that not make cooking a magical practice by that logic?\n\nIn my mind, it does - so since it is magic, and magic is a placebo effect, does that eliminate the scientific fact that - at the very least - my body absorbs nutrients and burns calories? No, it does not. The magical element is an additional piece in why I do it, sure, but not one that can be completely removed either.\n\nI suppose what I'm trying to say is - look for something practical you do already, and reconceptualise it as magic, rather than looking at a magical practice and then trying to fit it into practicality.\n\nLet's look at another example: baths. I love baths, I would happily spend every waking moment in water if I could, but practically I can't bathe every time I want to clean myself because of the water bill. So it's a very occasional thing, but I've noticed that I have developed a very specific routine before I bathe that could be constitute as magical practice.\n\nI clean everything before I bathe - laundry in the hamper, the bed is stripped, bare pillow and blanket get sprayed in cloth disinfectant, bathtub gets scrubbed, all clutter is put back where it belongs, incense or an essential oil is burned to make my bedroom smell nice, sometimes I even clean the kitchen if it's especially messy. My actual bath is also detailed: I light eight candles in the bathroom (I hate having a bright light there) - the number is determined by the amount of candle holders I have (fortuitous, in both senses of the word) - I add bath salts for my tense muscles, lemongrass and lavender oil because I love those scents together, I bring drinking water, my phone for reading, a speaker for music. I go the whole nine yards of exfoliating my body, deep cleansing and deep conditioning my hair with protein, face cleansing, sometimes shaving. Afterwards I moisturise my whole body, do my hair, tidy the bathroom, brush my teeth, replace the bed linens. My whole routine, from cleaning to washing to finally covering myself with my blanket, can take between 3 to 6 hours. \n\nThis is a routine I'm practiced with, and that I do without fail every time I bathe with the exception of a couple of elements depending on that day. That way, the \"sacrifice\" of the water and time feel worth it to me, it all enhances my relaxation, improves my sleep and cleanliness. It is a cleansing ritual in almost every sense of the word, except that I don't pray to a certain deity. The candles are ambience lighting, the essentials oils and salt for my enjoyment, the phone is for my comfort - there's some vague symbolism in the amount of candles I have, essential oils are largely considered to be sketchy scientifically as to whether they do anything, the fact that I have such an elaborate routine could all be considered placebo. They're technically \"not real\" beyond my own comfort and preference.\n\nBut that doesn't change the fact that a clean space lifts the mood, it doesn't change that psychologically humans enjoy having a clean smell after cleaning (that's how Febreeze became big - they weren't able to sell their product until they advertised it as the final step of the cleaning process where everything smells as clean as it looks), or that hot water and salts relax the muscles, or that the low light of the candles mean that more melatonin is released in my brain.\n\nI guess what I'm saying is, I don't have rituals that are stereotypically \"magical\" - I don't have an altar, meditate with incense or perform spells. My rituals are grounded in very practical routines that I have, including a few of my woo ideas, so that I don't rely solely on something that \"isn't real\". Whenever I've tried anything stereotypically magical or spiritual I would feel uncomfortable, because like you I would just have the thought of \"this isn't real, this is just placebo\" (although logically I know placebo is, scientifically speaking, just as effective as \"real\" stuff is in many cases). I couldn't enjoy it, and I would be in my head - so I ground it in or pair it with something \"real\", usually something that is scientifically backed, to have something akin to a staff to balance on the rope with.\n\nThat still doesn't stop the occasional thought of \"well, these aspects are still placebo, they still aren't technically real\" and that's kind of where I trip up because I can get into my head a bit. But still, the scientific backing feels like granite where faith feels like it changes its state of matter with the wind.\n\nThis is a very rambling response but I suppose the TLDR is basically that I find little comfort in relying on magic and placebo, even thought I believe in it to a certain extent, so I try to ground it in routines I would do regardless of magical elements and try to either see the magic inherent within those routines or ground them with elements that seem solid to me.\n\nHope you managed to get something out of this, if nothing else a different perspective perhaos.

It doesn't have to do with English Channel seperating it from the rest of Europe - if anything, I consider it to be the most mixed language in Europe since it was invaded by so many different factions at various points in time. Before it was a colonial powerhouse, the UK was quite often under the rule or influence of other countries, and more often than not that affects and influences the conquered countries language (just look at how much subtle Arabic influence there is in Spanish due to Muslim forces conquering the peninsula for around 700 years).

After years of being in a more rural area, it was like breathing clean air for the first time in a long time - I could call my mum speaking German and I could step into a Subway chattering in Spanish with my friends, all without being stared at like some freak (for the most part).

It's infuriating, because look closely at any country's history and I challenge you to find a country that hasn't a history as horrific as the Holocaust, or even worse - because you won't. Will those countries acknowledge it, and will the general population know about it? Hell no.

Does your career give you enough security and time off to actually enjoy having children around? Can you deal with the constant stimulation that is having kids around (eg loud noises and being on call 24/7) and still remain calm, or at the very least fair? - then certainly, go for it. You as an individual are allowed to change your mind, it doesn't mean you didn't feel vexed when someone said \"you'll change your mind\" because it was still a dismissal of your mindset and choices at the time. Just because they're right does not change that they were being an asshole - you're not \"betraying the movement\" or anything silly like that, you're living your life. It would be a different thing if you turned around and said the same things to a child free person yourself, but since you're not, it's all good. People who want to remain childless will remain so and some will change their mind - both are feminist choices, so long as everyone involved is making informed choices. No one should have children because they thing they *must*, and no one should refuse to have children because they think they *must* because of some cause or another. \n\nI would say the most important thing to consider is whether you'll be able to do right by the kid(s). You're never going to be in the perfect place to have kids - even if you could, circumstances always change (as the pandemic has shown), so you wouldn't be able to rely on that anyway - but you need to be *sure* that you'll have the self-discipline and dedication to do right by them. It doesn't mean having to be mom of the year every day, but it does mean that even on your worst days your kids should be safe, happy and healthy at the end of the day.\n\nI'm personally on the childless scale myself - I could end up changing my mind, I don't rule it out, but the thought of children don't even cross my mind when I think of my future. And I've always been like that, though my reasons for it have shifted and changed. I like children okay, I can deal with them in short intervals and I find them fun, sure - but I've been my mother's carer for almost a full decade at this point, a lot of it through my teens. I know the feeling of staying up in the night because something is wrong with their health, constantly stressed because you're waiting for someone to call your name because they need help, the confusing balance between allowing autonomy and giving help, that no matter how exhausted you are or how little sleep you got there has to be a meal on the table because they rely on at least one well-rounded meal (even if you enjoy cooking it's hard, and even more so when you hate it like I used to). It means being insecure, sad, tired, angry, frustrated, helpless - and doing it all anyway because you love them too much to let them down, and feeling like you're letting them down anyway (because there's always the voice in the back of the head saying you could've done more today). \n\nIt's not a job you can switch off when it becomes hard (and it will). Caring for someone, over many years and different circumstances, is hard. It has its fun moments, and it's a bond like no other, but that doesn't make it easy, and it certainly doesn't make it simple. And that's just my experience caring for a parent - children are a lot more volatile and changeable, as they should be since they're developing, but that would also make it far more challenging than even I'm describing. \n\nSo I'll say this both for you and for any potential kids you might end up having - if you're in it just to have some fun Christmases and Easters, because you want to go to kids places and have some fun, and think that's what it'll be most of the time - stick to having your cousins around, or your niblings if you have any, and don't have your own children. It will be like that *some* of the time, sure, and you'll have a lot of moments where you're so full of love you can't explain it, but it'll be hard.

I don't mind huge boob teens or 1000 year old lolis IN THEORY, because realistically one could make interesting character traits our of it - perhaps the 1000 year old loli is manipulative and knows people trust/help kids more, perhaps it is part of their immortal culture to live with a family at all times (sorta similar to the Cowboy Bebop episode), perhaps the huge boob teen really disliked her boobs because of the attention, and could spark a discussion about how women are forcefully sexualised as girls when puberty develops them prematurely, perhaps she likes them and utilises them like Faye does her sexiness (and why would a child do that, what was her life like that she feels she requires her appearance to have her needs met?), etc etc... Those two topes alone would be interesting traits to explore in terms of character development, themes of a show or making social commentary.\n\nBut no, instead it's used as a cheap sexual trope 95% of the time it feels like.

Shes not like an oblivious \"oops, don't understand why these men are behaving so strange, hur dur\" girl, nor is she portrayed as a innocent girl that just happens to be looking like a wet dream come alive. She's an opportunist, borderline manipulative, and she uses her appearance to that effect: she knows she'll get what she wants if she's sexy, so she's sexy.

He took one look at both of us and said, in a thick accent, \"I will need to see your license! (he points to my friend) HER I trust, YOU (points to me) I don't.\" to be fair, we were 19/20 at the time, so I thought it was fair enough, but it was just funny how my friend was so firmly believed whilst I was so firmly not. \n\nAnother time I've had a concerned dealer ask me if I was over 18, when I was standing next to my friend (different one) who is a head shorter than me - but somehow my face looked more baby-ish to him. I didn't really know what to say, so i just asked him \"what exactly do you want me to do, show you my license???\" I was in my 20s by then, and it came so out of left field, especially because I'd met him before haha. \n\nThose are two of the more memorable instances. Of course every time I buy alcohol or nicotine paraphernalia the cashier will look suspicious 9/10 and ask for my license with an expression on their face that says \"oh I KNOW you have to be lying to me\".

However, I think I am able to offer a perspective that might help you. Apologies, a long comment is incoming. \n\nSo, when I was a kid, I wore hand-me-downs and just kinda wore whatever. I would loosely color match my outfits, and wore a short headscarf/headband for most of my middle school years (bc every year there was a lice problem, and after I got it once my mother refused to deal with it again since curly hair is a nightmare with lice - and I had hated everything about treating it, so i begrudgingly went along even though I knew it was weird). Now, due to both of those things, my style was incredibly looked down upon - and I knew it. My peers made it very clear to me that I was ugly in their eyes. \n\nSo what I did is I changed outfits every day, after getting feedback from one of my peers, and what it turned into was this:\n\nPeer A: you don't look that good in yellow, I think you'd look better in green.\n\n(next day, wearing a green shirt)\n\nPeer B: hm, green doesn't suit you, wear red\n\nNext day wear a red shirt, that isn't liked by peer C, so on their suggestion I wear pink etc etc. This goes on for a good while, and then eventually I got back to one of my peers, like Peer A, and they'd say something like: \"oh green doesn't look good on you, I don't know why you'd even try it\"\n\nI realised that they didn't actually give a shit, because they just really found me ugly regardless of what I wore, because I have a birthmark on my face and I was chubby.\n\nI once even asked a peer, point blank, if I would ever be seen as attractive enough (because attractiveness was a huge part of whether or not you were \"presentable to be seen with\" - I've moved countries since then, and found this is not the case everywhere) and they told me \"no\".\n\nI asked \"is it because of my birthmark?\"\n\n\"YES\"\n\nAnd that was the hill I was willing to die on. \n\nThe message was clear: you can change clothing, you can wear makeup, you can lose or gain weight, you can straighten your hair, you can do everything and anything to temporarily change your appearance - doesn't matter, we've already decided that we don't like you, and don't want to be seen with you, unless you remove half of your cheek. And even then we probably won't accept you, because we changed our minds about the colors of your clothing everyday, what's to say we won't decide that the surgical scar is uglier than the birthmark?\n\nSo I changed my whole attitude regarding other people - started not giving a shit about what other people thought I looked like. If they wanted to treat me horribly (either by exclusi\u00f3n or outright bullying) because of my appearance, then I didn't need malicious people in my life. I've had people refuse to talk to me because of my birthmark, and you know what? I have never felt the loss of it, because they would prove themselves to be people you don't want to be around. Everyone is shallow to a certain extent, but I always know if someone is worth knowing based on how they react to my birthmark. It made my childhood difficult, but my god it makes it easy to avoid having negative people in my life - people don't bother putting on an act for me, more often than not people are brutally honest about what they think of me as a result, and that's a blessing I am incredibly thankful for in a world where people will lie with a smile. \n\n\nSo, long story short about what I want to say: you daughter is not guaranteed to make friends if she dresses better - some acquaintances, loose friends, sure. Good friends, that are likely to stay by her? Doubtful. My own peers never forgot or \"forgave\" what I'd dressed like, or my chubbiness, nevermind my birthmark - in all my childhood, they never stopped bullying even when I changed - if her peers have already dubbed her to be weird, then I'm sorry to say it might just remain that way unless she changes schools. Perhaps your daughter might even be sad because of this, rather than necessarily about not making friends - I know it took me a while to accept that were really THIS shallow. It's a shitty thing to come to terms with about the human race.\n\nDon't force it. If she wants to learn about appearance-based things, it will come in her own time. I developed a special interest in makeup, clothes styling, hair etc when I went to university, when I was in my 20s. I have so much fun with it now, and I'm sure I wouldn't have if my parent had forced me when I was a kid. Maybe your daughter has a particular reason why she dresses the way she does, and that's why she doesn't want to talk about it - maybe that's the hill she's willing to die on, idk.\n\nA good friend will come along, it will. I've had several great friends in my life so far (still in my 20s), from all different walks of life - some I knew for only a year or two, some I've known for half a decade, each one precious and dear to me. And each one I befriended not because of or in spite of my appearance - but because to them my appearance was a non-issue, and I  was reasonably sure I could trust them bc of that.\n\nSo yeah, hope this helps.

But from what I can tell, saying \"once you reach a certain size your body wants to return to that size\" is some very devious wording that's not WRONG per se, but definitely not right. \n\nSo, fat cells are somewhat unique in the fact that they swell - stay long enough on a caloric surplus and your fat cells will swell and, eventually, multiply like cells normally do. Now, the thing is if you lose weight - ie you're in a calorie d\u00e8ficit - you don't lose those new fat cells, they all shrink. So in a way, yes, your body has a certain amount of fat cells so it is easier for you body to regain that weight bc there are more cells that can swell up before having to multiply. Iirc this is is the reason why if you regain fat after liposuction your fat distribution looks odd - they remove fat cells from specific areas so those areas cannot swell as much as the other parts of the areas where you increased amount of fat cells are still found. However, this does not mean that sustainable weight loss is impossible, it just simply means you have to be more mindful about you eating habits more than a person who has never been overweight/obese - and that would be the case regardless due to the psychological and mental adjustments made when losing weight sustainably. \n\nI also want to mention with regards to your penultimate paragraph that calorie deficit inevitably leads to a slowing of metabolism - the body thinks you have limited food, so the best survival strategy is to limit calorie output. However this usually happens due to your body subconsciously moving less in order to save calories - you want to walk less, you want to sit down more etc. Once you switch to maintenance calories, your body will slowly increase activity levels and go back into balance.  This is one of the reasons why diet breaks (so doing a maintenance phase that lasts as long as the weight loss phase before starting another weight loss phase) is encouraged by some specialists (others include avoiding diet fatigue etc). \n\nAn additional note here: the rate of metabolism (ie how many calories you burn) is based on your total mass - whether that mass comes from fat tissue or muscle tissue. However, muscle tissue is more calorifically expensive to keep around and significantly healthier for your overall well being in higher quantities. Part of the reason why people struggle after weight loss with maintaining their weight is because people diet in a way that causes them to lose as much muscle mass as they are fat mass (fasting has been shown to do so, but also not eating enough protein and lacking any kind of strength training adds to this) which causes them to regain weight faster bc their bodies have less of the actual calorie burning tissue.\n\nHope that makes sense, I have to rush somewhere so I hope this helps!", "created_utc": "1632135739.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hdkryae", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_prg8pv", "parent_id": "t3_prg8pv", "score": "1", "subreddit": "loseit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rz8w"}, {"author": "KarmaKeepsMeHumble", "body": "I was born and lived in Ibiza for most of my childhood, and hands down the worst tourists were the British. The Balearic Isles are generally considered to be the party place of the British by the British, and they treat the islands like its the Las Vegas of Europe ie \"what happens in Ibiza, stays in Ibiza\" so no one takes any responsibility for what they do. Police have to work overtime due to drunken hooligans, hospitals are overwhelmed (both from drunks but also overdoses happening), local council's budgets have to go towards repairs as drunks break bicycle park spaces, street lamps, broken windows etc. Every local has some story or another of how a British drunk 20-something broke something on their business premises. A lot of airplanes don't lift off when flying out of Ibiza every day because of some fuckwit was sloshed and threatened flight crew or passengers. Littering and pollution is a HUGE issue on the island as well during tourism season, which is infuriating and saddening because the ecosystem of the island is absolutely breathtaking - in some ways it's comparable to Australia in terms of the uniqueness of the flora and fauna found on Ibiza (species that cannot be found on any of the other islands even) - but tourists do not give a single shit and although the local government tries, the Spanish government as a whole does not care because of the money. \n\nEvery year the island's population triples or quadruples for 3 months, and all consumables on the island inflate in price since most things are imported. Gas and food in particular go up. The housing market has been completely gentrified by wealthy fucks buying land and building mansions that they live in for a month at a time, if that. A lot of families (including my own) had to move away because it just became so stupidly expensive to just exist there. Tbf that's not the fault of British people alone - there are certainly other nationalities that have contributed to the gentrification, but the British were by far the most frequent since they were the first to really come en masse to the island.\n\nThe reason this is all tolerated is because the island is dependant on tourism - a lot of people make their money during the 3-5 months of the year when tourists arrive, and live off of that for the rest of the year. That being said, everyone knew even when I still lived there that that was not going to work for much longer.\n\nSorry got on a rant but honestly British tourists have fucked up the island in a myriad of ways that will never be reversible (like the local community), and it's so maddening because the British do not give a single fuck beyond wanting to drink their next fucking beer.", "created_utc": "1632044969.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hdg1hbl", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_pqyyk5", "parent_id": "t3_pqyyk5", "score": "44", "subreddit": "GlobalTalk", "subreddit_id": "t5_mg3b6"}, {"author": "KarmaKeepsMeHumble", "body": "The way I've always interpreted it is if someone does something that YOU find embarrassing.

By that point, I'd never met someone with autism (that I know of at least), and although I knew nothing about autism I did know that a female with \"high-functioning\" autism was statistically very rare. She was really open and straightforward about anything but especially about her sex life, and I was in love with her honesty and felt like I could be really open with her in turn (ie oversharing trait). However I noticed everyone else in our group (we met through an international program so we were all strangers to each other) reacted very differently to her - said that she it was weird how much she talked about kinks and sex, and just in general seemed weirded out. I didn't understand that at all, couldn't fathom why that was weird (it still isn't, to me).\n\nAnyway, once me and her got chatting about party drugs. I cannot remember the exact conversation, but essentially I related to her on a very instinctual level when she expressed how she felt more in tune with other people when under the influence of something. I'd never heard another human being describe the exact reason why I liked taking drugs - the effects were fun, of course, but the fact that everyone felt on the same level as me, that I felt included in a group seamlessly as long as all of us were under a substance, was equally as appealing.\n\nAt first I shrugged it off as me being weird (still didn't know much about autism, it was just a quick thought if \"what if?\" and thought I was being silly), but a couple of months later I came across Of Herbs and Alters, an aspie AFAB, due to their eating disorder content (because I was dealing with some pretty disordered eating at the time). I cannot remember which video it was, but they described how their substance abuse felt like a form of self-medication before being diagnosed, and suspected that a lot of Autistic people went through phases like that. A lot of their recounting of experiences on various drugs were very similar to my own experiences with said drugs, which often differed from my friends (which I'd chalked up to different body types/systems). They also described some of their atypical behaviour for an aspie, such as really enjoying parties and the club scene, also due to the fact that since everyone is \"fucked\" you don't feel like a weirdo. I related to a lot of their traits, and it also felt more real because they are located in Britain like myself atm.\n\nIt's been around 2 years since that point, doing intermittent research about autism in women, and am now seriously considering if I want to pursue a diagnosis because I am pretty certain by this point that I am Autistic to some degree. \n\nSo yeah, a conversation about the motivations and the experience of drug use with an autistic woman lead to me suspecting I have autism lol.", "created_utc": "1630933924.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hbszc49", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_piwpzg", "parent_id": "t3_piwpzg", "score": "6", "subreddit": "AutismInWomen", "subreddit_id": "t5_3yx96k"}, {"author": "KarmaKeepsMeHumble", "body": "Heya, just wanted to quickly comment since I noticed you and I have incredibly similar stats. We've lost roughly the same amount of weight with roughly the same starting weight (SW: 163, CW: 145) and roughly the same height (I'm 5'3). \n\nFirst of all, congratulations on managing this! I had a quick look at your profile to see your progress pictures, and read a little bit about your journey, and I have to say I'm doubly impressed that you managed it in spite of your circumstances. You should be so incredibly proud of yourself, because you deserve to be!\n\nWhen I look at your pictures, I can clearly see how your body has changed (we're surprisingly similar with how our bodies distribute fat and loses it, so I can recognise my progress in your pictures). I don't want to list the changes I see because I don't know if that could trigger something for you, and I'd rather not risk it (although if you ask I'll provide it), but you body looks healthy!\n\nTbh I think at this juncture, addressing you body dysmorphia (and mentality in general) should be a priority. I personally don't deal with body dysmorphia, but that you cannot see the incredibly changes you've made to your fitness and health is a little sad to me, and alarms me a little for your safety and health. The rhetoric of \"maybe if I lose 5 more pounds I'll be happy with my body\" is a slippery slope to go down (whilst I don't experience dysmorphia, I have been in this mentality before which lead to some binge-restrict cycles). Your body has already changed a lot, and I get the impression both here and on you progress pic post that you're not quite comfortable with your body regardless of how it aesthetically looks. And that's something that should be addressed first, because I have the feeling that even if you lost another 5 pounds you would still feel sad about your body. This mentality cannot be addressed by changing your body, but changing your mind. \n\nPerhaps a maintenance phase would be a good idea for you, to get comfortable with your body the way it is now and just in general. I've been on CICO since the beginning of June, and I'm getting ready to enter a maintenance phase (though like you, I'd like to lose a little more), because although I've been this weight before, I wasn't this *fit* or *healthy* when I was this weight last time (lost weight with disordered eating last time, and this time did it properly and healthily). In a way, it's a body I've never inhabited. Or, if I have at some point in childhood, I no longer remember it. And although I've loved how my body has changed, it doesn't nullify the fact that this body feels a little strange and alien to me right now, even without body dysmorphia distorting my perception. Mentally, I need some time to really internalise it. I certainly could keep up the calorie restriction for a while longer, but then I think to myself: why? Time is not getting away from me, and it's not like I would be doing nothing - maintenance is a journey all by itself, after all - and since my body is healthy and fit, there is no \"need\" to lose weight; losing any more would just be a \"want\" based on my personal aesthetic goals. \n\nMind you, I'm not an expert on weight loss or health or fitness, and a stranger besides, but I'd honestly recommend that you take some time to appreciate what you've done. You've lost a good amount of weight, you've gotten so much fitter, you've changed to healthy habits - maybe you've gotten stronger or faster, perhaps you increased your endurance, improved your breathing, improved your sleep, any number of things. Give yourself the grace to get used to that, and measure your happiness in your body not with regards to the scale, but in regards to your health and well being. If you find in a couple of weeks or months or years that you still would like to lose some fat, then that's okay - you will find the motivation then. And by that point, you won't feel like crying at the thought of dieting.\n\nI realise this comment got really long, but I hope you managed to get something useful out of it.

The key with strength training, as with weight loss, is consistency above all else and knowing how to adjust to different circumstances. Also, protein! Most girls don't consume enough protein in general, so keep an eye out for that - for women, the ideal is around 0.7g of protein per pound of body weight (I use kg to measure my body weight, but most info online I've found uses lbs, but it's easy enough to convert kg into lbs and go from there), which also helps a lot with feeling fuller for longer and satisfied with your meals.\n\nKeep in mind that body weight exercises can be adjusted according to your strength level as well, so you can track progress with your exercise progression even if you can't see body changes (takes longer to build muscle than it does to gain/lose fat, so don't be discouraged if you don't see progress immediately). For example, if you can't do a full push up yet, try doing kneeling push ups and if you can't do many of those yet, do incline push ups. r/bodyweightfitness has a beginners routine in their wiki that you can start of with (or to give you an idea what to look out for and adjust to however you need it), alternatively you can incorporate some quick sets when you're waiting for other stuff to happen - doing some dips and squats while you're watching a show (or perhaps letting the intro play and using that as a timer for a set) , or some incline push ups while you're cooking or waiting for a serum to absorb into the skin, having a heavy bag somewhere that you carry from one end of the house to the other etc. Those are some quick easy ways to incorporate some mild strength training in your day without having to go out of your way to do them or having to set aside time.\n\nA great resource for body weight exercises is Hybrid Calisthenics on YouTube - he does quick shorts that go through the progressions of body weight exercises (plus his attitude is super chill and positive).

The skin care community online skews towards informative, professional and \"scientific\" (putting this in quotation marks because some people seem to find the aesthetics of science more appealing rather than actual science - see every time there's a new trendy ingredient that has minimal research indicating effectiveness), which means that comedic elements and charisma are harder to include in your content without seeming like you don't know what you're talking about. And that's important to the audience it attracts since, unlike makeup, messing around with skin care too hard can mess up your skin hard core. Social media makeup gurus started off with average Sally doing her makeup and trying to share some tips - professional presentation and industry knowledge was not expected (nor needed since it makeup, for the most part *side eying Lipstick Gate situation*, is considered safe to use for the consumer). Its only in the last 2 or so years that I've seem professional makeup artists actually becoming prominent in the social media space, probably as a reaction to the bs of makeup enthusiast gurus/influencers - however the groundwork/precedent of showing a distinct personality on camera is set, thereby allowing makeup content creators to be \"charismatic\".\n\nTLDR: skin care content doesn't lend itself to showing personality, so i don't think it's James inherently being less charismatic than his brother - simply a reflection of how the social media space has constructed their respective fields of interest.\n\nAs for the second point of your comment, I understand the disappointment of not seeing skin care influencers stand up for ethical business practices (or ethics in general), I do personally think its a little unfair to the influencers. At the end of the day, social media is their job - arguably, their job is similar to that of a shop assistant/marketer - and before anything else they're colleagues, not friends. They might genuinely be friend irl, but that doesn't change that they're still colleagues and have met predominantly bc they were colleagues. When you're working in the same industry as other people, you can't really treat them the exact same as friends that hold each other accountable, you are friendly colleagues that shut up because speaking up could royally burn a majority of bridges in that industry for you. What I mean to say is - at best they can only remain neutral (ie James sharing info on the claims of Hyram's skincare line), because wither way lies pretty negative consequences. Either you speak out against your colleagues, thereby risking alienating yourself from the industry and making your job significantly more difficult (especially considering how little legal safety nets you have with social media work - there's no HR, Labour laws or anyone that could back you up really), or you stand by your colleagues and risk alienating your following and thereby also making your job significantly more difficult (we saw with NikkieTutorials and her Too Faced palette how long it took to earn back her followings trust, and we see it with KVD and JHC how brand owner scandals have significantly impacted each brand). Its a lose-lose situation really, I can't really blame influencers for choosing to stay silent in the face of such outcomes tbh.\n\nBTW I'm not having a go at you or anything, all this has been on my mind for a long while and I guess today my brain decided it needed to be vomited out lol", "created_utc": "1623323026.0", "edited": "False", "id": "h19l15f", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_nwbzml", "parent_id": "t1_h190n2f", "score": "46", "subreddit": "BeautyGuruChatter", "subreddit_id": "t5_3jayp"}, {"author": "KarmaKeepsMeHumble", "body": "I have never heard of the different chakra corresponding to different planets, that's amazing!

Maybe because its just useless knowledge by that point (ie I've made up my mind by then, so the why doesn't need to be remembered, sort of like I've got the solution to a maths problem so I don't need to remember the process to know its right), and so my brain decides to forget it, or perhaps my brain tries to protect me from hurtful memories - either way, I forget.

On the one hand, yes skincare is important. On the other hand, people way over do it and buy products they don't really need - which is only made worse by influences (as all of us are most likely familiar with).\n\nI've fallen into the skincare hole around 2-3 years ago, so a little before this media frenzy. I can tell you exactly what the must-haves are (because I've been there): sun cream (protect), oil cleanser and water cleanser (double cleanse), night moisturiser (to recuperate the skin barrier - perhaps add a day moisturiser if your sun cream isn't moisturising enough - but that's unlikely bc the market is full of moisturising sun creams plus reapplication) and some sort of exfoliant (to cleanse and aid skin barrier - chemical is better for skin long term). That's it. 5 products are the solid foundation of skincare, if you got those you don't need anything else. And these 5 procuts aren't expensive (cleansers especially you can get away with for cheap). Everything else is extra, and only necessary if you have particular skin concerns (eg acne, overly dry or oily skin, anti-aging).\n\nTo be honest, expensive skin care is a fucking scam in my opinion. You use most products up within 3 months if used daily, 6 months if weekly, expensive products are not sustainable. Frankly, if you're paying over $40 for any individuals skincare product I would side eye it pretty hard. There's so many affordable brands - The Ordinary and The Inkey List to name two accessible western brands (personally, even $20 is side eye worthy, excepting if I'm looking for something vegan or cruelty free specifically). A lot of Korean brands like Cosrx, innisfree, Apieu are also reasonably affordable (and imo have THE BEST sun creams) - YesStyle has frequent discounts on skincare products and they're phenomenal.\n\nAs for retinol - that's only really necessary if you want to prevent signs of aging, if you have noticeable texture or frequent breakouts. Look up on YouTube the channel Doctorly and watch the two videos on retinol that they have - they're both dermatologists and give good advice.

With some caveats of course.\n\nGenerally, the cheaper the perfume the cheaper the ingredients/more watered down in order to keep a good profit margin. This means that oftentimes the scents don't last that long and/or don't project very well. Whilst people on this sub will make it seem like the most offensive thing on earth, if you're able to take the fragrance with you (you can decant it and carry it in a jacket pocket if need be) it's not an issue (plus the golden rule is always \"a scent should be noticed, not announced\" so imo having a loud fragrance can be a bit of a hassle). Cheaper fragrances also tend to be one note, which is great in terms of applicability because it can be worn anytime, but imo a little lackluster (but considering that I am on a fragrance sub that's not surprising), so that's something to keep in mind. But that's only the general trend, you can find nice fragrances from places such as Lush for relatively good prices (some indie companies provide great fragrances for fair prices as well) \n\nHowever, expensive fragrances aren't all that great either. Expensive does not equal good, or that you'll like it. What it means is that a lot of your money goes towards the brand name itself - sure some of that money is because of the scent, a lot of it because of the bottle, but most is because of the brand name. If you're buying Dior you're paying to have a Dior-branded object over the actual perfume, if you get what I'm saying. Generally expensive fragrances tend to be good, but waaaay overpriced. \n\nYou can find some gems for cheap, you can find absolute disappointments for exorbitant prices. If you aren't sure what you like yet (and it takes a while to develop a nose for notes and see what you enjoy), buying decants and samples will be your best bet. There is also the option of clone houses which replicate designer/niche fragrances for cheaper. This is a pretty controversial topic, however for me personally I don't enjoy the idea of paying for a brand name, so clone houses are great imo (Eden Perfumes is a great option).\n\nI guess to answer your question, there's overall not that much difference, because a lot remains the same - you'll like some scents, you'll dislike others, either you are willing to try new stuff or you aren't and you'll purchase what you are comfortable purchasing.

Ideally, you'd want to clean/disinfect any brushes that have dealt with creams (foundation, concealer, liquid blush, liquid eyeshadow, etc) EVERY DAY. Bacteria is no joke (can cause breakouts, infections etc) and it grows FAST - be especially careful of this if you live in a humid, warm climate. Brushes used for powder products can be left alone for a week (any brushes that you use to set the creams with should be cleaned twice a week). \n\n- To add on - NEVER SHARE BRUSHES UNLESS YOU'VE CLEANED THE BRUSH.

I'd suggest checking out some of the research coming out about this topic (and of course reading the account on here), but I'll give a quick bulletpoint list how it specifically relates to alleviating my anxiety. \n\n- nicotine is a stimulant - iirc it stimulates the adrenal gland and causes your body to essentially have a small fight or flight moment. I've noticed being much calmer without nicotine, and less likely to experience extreme physical reactions to stress (eg anxiety or panic attacks)\n\n- you're rid of a bad habit response - PROVIDED YOU'VE TAKEN STEPS TO REPLACE IT WITH A HEALTHIER RESPONSE. The smallest inconvenience, amusement, joy or just simply opportunity warranted a smoke. My first instinct was to smoke. Now I'm forced to consider different responses, starting by tuning into my body and trying to live in the moment, rather than attempting to heighten it with a drug. I know it sounds really hippie-nonsense, but I've certainly found that being more in tune with my physical/emotional responses has allowed me to navigate my anxiety easier. \n\n- Less guilt - about money, about my health, about people in my life. Smoking affected all of these areas negatively - I was spending quite a lot of money (even with rolling my own cigs) on essentially ruining my respiratory system, and it would inconvenience the people around me or encourage other smokers in my circle to continue as well. Those elements are not there anymore - I can spend that money now on hobbies that intellectually stimulate me, I'm not actively ruining my health and I do not feel like a burden any more (granted covid helps, but still).\n\n- there is a lot of extra toxic shit being put into tobacco - stuff that is also used for plane fuel being one of them iirc. But basically 100s of different chemicals that are massively toxic, and you want to tell me that that doesn't affect the body and thereby the mind??? I had switched to vaping and had cut down nicotine over the course of 10 months (when I switched I was on around 7-10 cigs per day, but had various points where I was in the 20-30 range, I knew cold turkey would not be an great option for me) and even during that time I saw a lot of mental improvement. The addictive substance was the same, it was the other chemicals that were gone - the heavy lung feeling alleviated and breathing improved which, in hindsight, are similar to physiological effects of anxiety attacks and panic attacks.

It's still one letter, but in essence you're combining the sound of two vowels. You can use that tid bit of knowledge as a loose queue as to how it's pronounced.\n\nRight so \u00fc I think might be an easier sound to find in the English language. An example would be something like the word \"music\" - the first syllable sounds like \"myu\", if you remove the \"y\" from the sound it is very similar to \u00fc. I would imagine the word \"m\u00fche/muehe\" (tl: effort) could be a good word to practice with this in mind. \u00dc also sounds a little similar to \"ew\" sound in \"knew\" or \"revenue\" (I'm basing this on my experience with Southern England English here, so my examples might not apply with these). Try and find examples of natives saying the word \"Mutter\" and then \"M\u00fctter/Muetter\" - both mean mother except the second is the plural ie \"mothers\" - try and see if you can hear the difference and emulate it as best you can. Recording and comparing will be extremely useful here! \n\nFrom my subjective experience, you can hear more of the first vowel in this umlaut (remember ue as a queue!) compared to \u00f6, which I'll explain now. \n\nRegarding \u00f6, I'll admit I was pretty stumped to find any similar sounds in English, but I was able to recall some words that use a similar throat/mouth movement. Think of the \"eeh\" sound in \"fur\", or \"heard\", they both use a breath that you can sort of feel on top of your tongue in the middle of your mouth. Expect I would say the air you expel goes \"forward\" straight out of your mouth instead of slightly up (again could vary if your accent is different). The word \"Vogel\" and \"V\u00f6gel/Voegel\" could be a great place to see if you can hear and emulate the different (tl: bird and birds). With this umlaut it definitely feels less like the sound of the o is less pronounced than what the u is in \u00fc, which might help you distinguish them.\n\nHope this can help you in your journey to learn German!

The rest of your  pronunciation isn't perfect, but if you were to improve you umlaut pronunciation alone that would improve your overall speech a lot.", "created_utc": "1612614957.0", "edited": "False", "id": "gm853sh", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_ldm884", "parent_id": "t3_ldm884", "score": "3", "subreddit": "JudgeMyAccent", "subreddit_id": "t5_2ufiq"}, {"author": "KarmaKeepsMeHumble", "body": "1. Write a script, learn it.\n\n2. Record yourself, memorise how you will be presenting it (what's your pace, where do you want to put emphasis). Record yourself doing it - first film yourself doing each paragraph, tweaking the script if needed to make it sound more natural. Plus you'll be able to note where you need sign posting language (ie when someone says \"okay, with x being said, certain criticisms emerged over time regarding y\").\n\n3. Memorise the adapted script, record yourself doing the whole presentation. It's OK if you don't get it down pat all the time - maybe this means you need to adjust the script or the PowerPoint slides to help you along (if applicable). Oftentimes, you don't even need to memorise word for word - as long as you have the key words down and what you're wanting to say you'll be good. Eg. With key words climate change, economic disadvantage, impoverished countries you can word it \"climate change is well documented to negatively affect impoverished countries' economic stability\" or \"impoverished countries have been documented to be disproportionately affected by the changes in the overall global climate, predominantly economically\". Get what I'm saying? So long as the key words and meanings are there you're solid. The only real thing you have to really keep in mind the order of your points/line of argument. \n\nOther general tips:\n\n- if you have a PowerPoint/slide show to go along, make it key word bulletpointed and make sure those key words are in your script too - it means that if you forget something you can quickly read through the bullet points on the slide to find your place again (plus the listener is more focused on the slides with your voice as a 'guide' so to say - ergo it'll feel like less pressure on you)\n\n- I personally found that having a typed out script with the key words highlighted helps a lot. A separate, written out bullet point list of points and keywords also helps (writing stuff by hand is shown to help with memorisation)\n\n- Present it to a friend first if possible to practice.\n\n- check that you know how to deal with Zoom before presenting - again a friend is a good idea to really familiarise yourself with where every button is so that you don't get anxious about pressing the wrong button and not knowing what to do.\n\nOf not anything is helping, honestly medication might be the most advisable step. With all of these methods I was a really good public speaker, but when my anxiety got worse I eventually caved and went to get a prescription for propranolol because my heart wouldn't stop racing no matter what I did (it only affects the heartbeat/physiological symptoms, it's a very different thing to ssri medication) .

Absolutely none. There is a sizeable amount of darker skinned people in Europe and you don't remain a well-established brand by digging in your heels usually. You are meant to adapt and evolve.

If I remember correctly, he learns languages so he can take in the mediums of his target language (books especially, if memory serves me right, it's been a long time since I checked his stuff) - which is fine if that's your goal in learning your target language. Outputting is therefore less of a priority, which again is fine. But all of the anecdotal evidence I have encountered in my life disprove the notion that with enough input output is bound to follow. Output is a different beast to input, and whilst they definitely co-exist together (ie correlated), one does not immediately lead to the other (ie causation). It is the difference between passive interaction with the language and active participation in the language. \n\nI can only speak from my experience speaking two languages fluently and two at an advanced level, plus meeting a staggering number of people that could understand what was being said to them but could not order a coffee to save their life. I have met people that have lived in a foreign country for years but cannot speak the language beyond a few key words, as well as people who've learnt a language at university for 4 years but were like deers in headlights when encountering small talk. For me personally, Mr Krasher's method is alright for those that have a similar goal to him (or a select few who are suited for his style of learning), but for those who want to actively participate in the language it seems to me to defeat the purpose of learning a language in the first place (ie that you can use it). At the very least, it is limited, and imo not something you can solely rely on. \n\nI'm not saying my method is perfect either, or suited for everyone. It has a lot of caveats attached to it: that you self-correct yourself, more time intensive up front since you'll need to research how and why what you wrote is incorrect etc (although I think that it creates the good habit of being self-aware regarding your gaps in your learning and eventually how to correct yourself on the fly). But again that brings me back to my point: it's a matter of common sense and knowing yourself with what method(s) suit your learning style and where you are in your learning journey.\n\nRegarding your second point\n> I personally think you should design your language learning process to be enjoyable and repeatable everyday for a long period of time. If you start feeling burnt out, fixing the root cause would be more effective than a break.\n\nI have to agree with you that an adjustment in one's process would be more beneficial than stopping completely. I suppose I was coming from the presumption that you are learning a language because you already enjoy mediums in that language regardless of your ability to understand/speak it. For example, if I were to take a break I'd still be watching anime because I was already consuming that medium before I started actively learning, so even if I took a break I would still be exposing myself to the language and getting input. But I concede that that was a hasty presumption to make, and therefore misleading advice to give.", "created_utc": "1604927365.0", "edited": "1604928359.0", "id": "gbpr2gb", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_jqfrdn", "parent_id": "t1_gbpj8xp", "score": "3", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "KarmaKeepsMeHumble", "body": "Eh, I think #11 and #16 are dependent on your own common sense and knowing yourself. \n\nI'd say 11 is a great tip provided that you are conscious of the fact that nothing you write is likely to be grammatically correct, or make sense for that matter. For example, I wrote a haiku in my target language the other day and after I wrote it analysed it myself - found a spelling error, one of the words I used wasn't right for the context, the verb conjugated incorrectly. I don't doubt there's more mistakes, but long-term memory is cemented through recall and writing is a pretty good way of doing so. So yeah, the mindset you approach it with is the important distinction between making bad habits or furthering your skills.\n\nNumber 16 I'd say again depends on common sense.

However, I think it is a matter of *how* one *becomes* wealthy in a capitalist society that makes this connection so prevalent for people ie through the exploitation of workers. The fact of the matter is that in order to get big money in capitalism cruelty is required - why pay 10 people a living wage when you can pay the same amount of money to employ 25 people that are desperate to get by (ie in another country, illegal immigrants, child workers)? Why buy a bigger plot of land to keep 100 animals living comfortably when you could squeeze 150 in a plot of land half the size of that? Why pay for taxes when governments sometimes throw themselves at you (through tax breaks) in the hope that you will choose their country/city to be your new headquarters (I'm using specifically Amazon as an example here - look into how they chose their headquarters/NY and other states incentivised them it's wild)? \n\nCapitalism is based upon the principle of \"maximum profit with minimum expenses\" - and with current legislation as it is there's no real incentive other than a company owner's own inherent morality to \"maximise profit, minimise suffering and expenses\" (and even that could not be enough since share holders, co-owners, investors etc also have a say in how a company operates as well, if I remember correctly).\n\nFrom my personal perspective, I think when most people get annoyed with the wealthy, it's not with people like yourself who work in those companies or generally get high salary jobs per se - but rather the people like Jeff Bazos and Mark Zuckerberg who's wealth is in the literal three-figure *billions* that most countries on earth do not even have. *Billions* that are certainly earned in part because of their own hard work, I won't deny, however a much larger part to their wealth is because they exploit their workers, sell data, won't pay taxes etc. I do not personally say \"wealthy are evil\" because that is a very big statement to make - however I think most people use it as a shorthand to say all that's stated above since most other social media does not allow for a nuanced discussion, but rather snippets of dialogue that are bound to be incentive (side eying twitter hard here).

So maybe I cannot relate to you feeling like and \"uncultured idiot\" (at least not in regards to languages - I've had that feeling in regards to music though since I had musically inclined friends) but perhaps I can offer you the perspective of your bilingual friends.\n\nI think most bilinguals and polyglots are aware that their language acquisition has been, at least partially, luck of circumstances. They had a parent who spoke a foreign language, grew up moving around, grew up in one place during their childhood and moved as a teen or a combination of these. What I'm getting at is: these circumstances do not make language learning *easy*, per se, but certainly easier because it allowed for consistent exposure to the other language(s). I certainly believe that if I hadn't been brought up the way I was, I would not be multilingual at all. It's a lot harder, and in my opinion far more impressive, that you've *decided* to learn several languages, regardless of how \"fluent\" you became with each of them. I'm trying to deliberately learn a language now as an adult, and I'm finding it tricky due to consistency. \n\nYou certainly doesn't sound uncultured to me - that would imply you've never bothered wanting to expand your horizons at all.

In fact, I'd argue that it's impressive you bother learning any languages at all.

In Spain, people would speak to me in whatever language was more comfortable for them, since most of my peers were at least bilingual if not trilingual - my language repertoire was considered impressive, but not overly unique. Part of that was because the area I lived in was a popular tourist place to travel to. However, that changed when I moved to a southern England small town for school (around 14), where my ability to speak 4 languages was seen as simultaneously exotic and strange because I looked and sounded the same as my peers.\n\nWhenever I spoke a language apart of English, I would get this special kind of look. The sort of look of \"oh, you don't belong here\". Now I don't want to come across as woe is me, but rather to illustrate that there is a subtle hostility against you if you speak anything not-English in an English speaking country. Then again, I think some of that is specific to England as well since UKIP was on the rise at the time, and the response UKIP evoked hasn't abated since then either. \n\nIn some ways I would describe it as an extension of xenophobia. Simply because the reactions I would get after I spoke Spanish or German (or even stated I was German/Spanish) was the same reaction other foreigners would have when they spoke with an accent. So that is one reason why foreigners are generally weary to speak their native languages - they are already seen as \"other,\" possibly even as \"dangerous\", just because of their accent. And then being seen in public or in a social setting (like school or the workplace) speaking not-English? Generally didn't work out well for them, it usually excludes them further from their peers. So it's safer, in some ways, to not speak their native language. (of course if you have a multicultural, multilingual workplace school that is not the case really - but I'm speaking from the perspective of a foreigner being in a sea of English and finding you are singled out for every little thing that makes you *cough*alien*cough* foreign to them)\n\nNow if we're talking about an English speaker going to a foreign country, let's say Italy just as an example, and wanting to speak Italian to practice - whether you'd be able to practice depends on how tourist heavy the area is you're going to. If its a high-tourist area, bartenders etc are just simply too busy to really bother parsing through rudimentary Italian with you. It's quicker to just go with English because that makes the job easier, because generally their ability to speak English will be better than your ability to speak Italian. Unless your Italian is noticeably good (ie its evident that you can hold a conversation with minimal pauses and have good pronunciation), they won't bother. The further you go from tourist attractions/areas, the better your chances that they'll let you speak since Italian will be the easier language to speak for them.\n\nAnother point I would like to address in your post is the lack of foreign languages being learnt in the UK - I can tell you for certain that it's because languages are taught horrendously in the UK. First of all, it is taught far to late for most people to use it effectively (or at the very least, it is taught at a must later age than most countries start teaching English). Second of all, it suffers from the same problem a lot of school subjects suffer from in the UK, but languages exacerbate the problem - there's an emphasis to get you to pass the exam, rather than actually speaking the language comprehensively. I'm still enraged to this day about the a-level exams I took in Spanish which forced me translate a text word for word exactly - first time the teacher told us to translate something, I did it the way you should translate it. When I gave it back to him, he said that my translation was beautiful and if I were in a workplace (or commissioned for a translation) it would be great - in the exam, I would've gotten maybe 1 mark out of 40.\n\nThat to me stands as the singularly perfect, elucidating example of the way languages are taught, and subsequently examined, in the UK is in direct opposite to the whole point of speaking another language in the first place (ie that you can use it in a social setting). And the thing is, I remember living in Spain where English teens and 20-somethings learnt Spanish (or had a degree IN SPANISH) but wouldn't be able to say a single sentence. Just no clue as to what to do when when faced with a real-life situation with the language they're learning. So yeah, English defaulting is often easier for everyone involved (but not better, imo). \n\nThe only thing I can say is as an English native YOU have to make the effort to continue speaking your target language, because most people had to make the effort to learn your language since they were 6 or younger. Even if your conversationalist responds in English, you have to keep pushing because English has simply become the default in the majority of situations.\n\nRight so I feel like I've lost the point of this response a while back, but I hope it clarifies some things in regards to the questions you posed nonetheless . I'm interested in seeing what everyone else thinks.

But I get what you mean - there's a sort of golden point where you feel like you are similarly comfortable in all languages, where some characteristics of your personality shine through no matter what grammar structure or vocabulary you're using. Joking or translating on the fly. Glorious. And then one day you just wake up and you're stood there going \"wtf is the word for plate again?\"\n\nThe thing I'm getting at here is the same reason why I dislike a lot of the discourse on languages of the polyglot community online - maintenance of your existing languages is just as important as learning the newest exciting language. \n\nAnd that's basically the advice I can give you - you have to be interacting with every single one of your languages on an at least weekly basis, but optimally on a somewhat daily basis. That shit is hard to do if you don't have friends that speak all of the same languages as you - but reading or watching something in your various languages can at least somewhat help. But really in order to be able to be a verbal entertainer, you have to be able to practice it.\n\nHowever the good news is that you will be able to pick it up fairly quickly again. German is one of my native languages, but the last 4 years I was only using it for 30 minutes every week (at best). Got very rusty at it, and more often than not used an English word with a German accent - but the last 3 months I've been speaking it daily, and I'm back at being able to make puns and use some technical language again. \n\nHaven't quite gotten all of my flair back, but the point I'm making is that if storytelling, verbal grandiosity and a flair for dramatic engagement with your conversation partner is part of your personality, then being able to utilise it is just simply (but not necessarily easily) a matter of brushing up on your language skills.

As a result, every media piece has to be \"worth it\" to watch, since it's going to be the only thing I'll be able to get round to watching in a while. And I don't want to watch something where I know the majority of the story beats or plot points, because there's no real point. For example, I really would like to watch both FMA anime, but since I've already read the manga Brotherhood feels useless to watch just to see the same story and characters, but animated. And I know the 2003 version has a different story around halfway through, but when I watch something I want to watch the whole thing from start to finish (and also bc I don't remember every individual story beats from the beginning - just enough to be like \"oh yeah, I remember this happening\") so I know that half of my time watching it would feel just as dissatisfying.\n\nI think it also depends how much is spoilt, and also in what genre - if you get spoilt as to who the murderer is, then no matter how good the pacing, storyboarding, animation etc all sense of suspense and mystery is just gone.

When I started with makeup I wore eyeliner and liquid lipstick, which would take me a good 15 minutes each to get to a point where I was happy with it. Over the course of a couple of weeks I got it down to 3 minutes without having to clean up edges or anything. Really useful for days where you just have to get out of the door. \n\n- Seeing individual techniques/makeup features as \"stages\" and, at least for me, going a \"completionist\" route - let's take blush for example. I might watch some videos on blush placement (EG Alexandra Anele's \"dude x makeup placement changes your whole face) - first you try a classic blush placement on the apples of the cheek, then a more structures blush over contour, then taking it to the temples. Other \"stages\" can include time periods or trends - blush draping, e girl blush, heavy 80s and 90s blush. Then I go into colours and textures - a matte yellow, shimmery lavender, luminous orange. For textures you can then try using an eyeshadow, a too-dark highlighter, a lipstick for cream blush. I consider it bonus points if I experiment with products I already have or can frankenmakeup it - mixing some lipstick with my foundation to make it a more liquid y cream, mixing an eyeshadow with duraline to make a liquid blush.\n\nAdmittedly, the second type of gameifying makeup is a sort of Columbo approach of \"oh, one more thing\" and involved, but I am the kind of person that isn't satisfied until I reach the bottom of things, so for me it's quite fun but might be tedious for you.\n\nOff the top of my head you could do a \"challenge mode\" (but not like the Internet challenges bc they're dumb bordering on dangerous usually) - using only 1 colour for the whole makeup look, or just 1 product. Perhaps using only powder, or only cream/liquid. Matching the pattern of your eye makeup to the pattern on your outfit - incorporating polka dots, or leaves or some flowers.

What are we (the reader) meant to learn from this, what are you trying to tell us?\n\nConsidering that it's the God of Comedy and Tragedy, my first thought would be that you're writing the story with a humorous tone (hijinks happen, funny situations etc) and the tragedy at the end to emphasise how tragedy and comedy are two sides of the same coin (sort of a mix on the idea that time + tragedy = comedy)? Perhaps one of your characters is symbolic towards accepting tragedy and facing it with good humour, and the other is symbolic for the ironic comedy of fighting the inevitable (ie tragedy, suffering) - the second character perhaps fights harder and harder against the loop and hijinks ensue. Perhaps they could be a commentary on how laughter and crying sounds the same sometimes. \n\nPerhaps you want to say how the unbeatable becomes more tolerable with good company?\n\nOr perhaps your theme is about how art is an ouroboros, the same two musicians expressing the same themes that all artists go back to - love, tragedy, humour, etc. Just how the musicians play at the same festival, art remains within its own circles. Perhaps one could take it farther and make the story allegorical that humanity faces tragedy if art remains on a loop in one specific place. I don't know, but I think you get my point.\n\nIn art, tragedy just for tragedy's sake isn't really satisfying. Humans like to feel that tragedy has a purpose (to make you stronger, to inspire you, bring you closer to people etc) - in real life, tragedy occurs for no other reason than it being a feature of life (of course it can be tackled that way as well, but that's not really what your story insinuates, since it is a deliberate act of a god). \n\nI guess what I'm saying is: have the tragedy of your characters mean something, and for that you need some sort of theme or stance to orient yourself with.

That took a lot of pressure off, but also meant that eyeshadow was really fun - I only did it bc I wanted to try it, not bc I consciously said to myself \"you have to get better at this!\" \n\nI'm now moving onto complexion, and I'm finding that my progress is pretty slow bc it is a lot more involved, with a lot more individual placements/products/textures to worry about all at the same time--bronzer, blush, foundation, powder, undereyes, highlighter etc. Even with my understanding of blending and undertones, complexion requires an ability to identify shadows and contours of the face and subsequently enhance/adjust those areas. It's difficult.\n\nIf I could give a bit of advice, I'd suggest this from my own experiences:\n\n- Focus on one feature, or one type of product, for however long it takes you to be comfortable with it. Eyeliner, blusher, lips, foundation (without contour etc, just the skin), whatever. Just hone in on that and slowly tweak the placement until you feel like it suits you best. Or maybe until you've found a couple of options that suit you (eg I found with winged eyeliner I can go small, or with a really long/dramatic wing, and both look good - but not really in between bc of my hooded eyes). Then focus on being able to recreate that in shorter and shorter increments. \n\n- Take photographs: I don't really like selfies but this gives you visual reference of what worked and what didn't. Also this provides a quick way to see how much progress you've made. You'd be amazed by how quickly you improve. I take 3-5 photographs - on looking straight ahead, one of both sides of my face (or 3/4 profile, depends on how long I make my eyeliner or how blown out my eyeshadow is). Maybe a closed eyes photo if I'm focusing on eyeshadow, or a close up of a particular area.\n\n- Practice. Tbh this is the entire crux of it - makeup is an artistic skill, and it requires time to develop an eye for undertones and their interplay, the wrist movement for blending, the ability to discern features and how to enhance them. You don't have to wear your makeup in public - play around with it in the evenings or weekends, bc that's practice too! Like any skill, your improvement is determined by how much time you put into it, and how consistent you are.\n\nLet's say Person A practices makeup every day for 1 hour, around five days every week. Person B practices makeup 2 hours Saturday and Sunday. In one month, Person A is more likely to be better at applying makeup bc they've had 20 hours of practice, 4 hours more practice than Person B at 16 hours. Of course this is a very simple example, and you obviously don't count how many hours you're practice's, but the point stands that the more you put into it, the more likely you are to get more out of it.\n\nGod this turned into a whole essay, sorry about that but its already written now so I can only hope it helps even a little haha.\n\nTldr: I would say I'm proficient to good in individual aspects of makeup, such as lips and eyes, whereas I'm still an amateur at other aspects of makeup such as complexion. This happened mainly because I focused on areas one at a time, depending on which areas were of interest to my lifestyle at the time. A rough estimation in regards to me being proficient at any one feature/product would be 3-6 months. Makeup is a skill, and therefore requires the 2 aspects for learning any skill: time and practice.", "created_utc": "1601456305.0", "edited": "False", "id": "g75m1ix", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_j2f24z", "parent_id": "t3_j2f24z", "score": "3", "subreddit": "Makeup", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qrwc"}, {"author": "KarmaKeepsMeHumble", "body": "I thought this was a cover and calendar in one at first!

So some brands I'll never use include:\n\n- Too Faced: controversies aside (which tbf I refuse to buy from them anyway bc of that), I despise their packaging so much. Especially with how it changes between cutesy-kiddish and then sex-adultish - if they were two different brands I'd be okay with each, but in one brand together it just annoys me bc it feels overly pandering to trends and inconsistent. Idk maybe part of it is my annoyance with the Madonna complex in media in a brand, but regardless I despise it.\n\n- ABH: I found them boring before Norvina was head chief, but with now with how they've fucked it last year with collaborations and MLMs I'm super disinterested in supporting them. I see how they changed the makeup game by basically introducing reds and pinks as a new form of neutral colour palette, but for me majority of their palettes have been boring (Sultry, Soft Glam, Modern Renaissance, Norvina) or annoying to even consider owning (the big Norvina palettes) \n\n- Lancome: their makeup is like the smell of their perfumes: boring and doesn't leave much of an impact. If it leaves an impact at all. \n\n- any brand that is ONLY neutrals, ie Tarte, KKW, Kylie Cosmetics: its just not my style - all power to you if its yours but I generally want brands to show some variety rather than the same warm toned brown neutral palette with the occasional blue thrown in.\n\n- Glossier: i understand the hype, for some people this is really it. Hell, I enjoy making my foundation seem like I have nothing on, I get it. But with Glossier it's mainly the price that REALLY annoys me - idk I feel like I can find so many sheer, less pigmented makeup products at drugstore prices rather than paying premium for Glossier, that to me it feels scammy. Again, more power to you if you like them, I just know that if I ever bought from them I'd become SUPER salty about it lol.", "created_utc": "1601384533.0", "edited": "False", "id": "g71ze3a", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_j1udv3", "parent_id": "t3_j1udv3", "score": "10", "subreddit": "Makeup", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qrwc"}, {"author": "KarmaKeepsMeHumble", "body": "I'll suggest some content creators here that can help with application and technique, most of which are/were professional makeup artists that you can orient yourself on.\n\n- Robert Welsh - really breaks down WHY you put makeup in certain places and WHY/WHEN/HOW you should use certain products like primers and loose setting powders\n\n- Wayne Goss - has more detailed, shorter videos on individual techniques and details what suits certain face and eye shapes. I feel like his audience is mainly older women or mature/textured skinned people, but his techniques overall work on everyone. \n\n- Jackie Aina - tbh she's more of a review/entertainment channel, but she's an ex pro MUA so she has some great tips sprinkled in each video. \n\n- Alexandra Anele's \"dude (x makeup item) changes your whole face\" tutorials are great to know why you would use certain techniques and applications over others\n\n- Snitchery's \"Why YOU should change your ENTIRE (x makeup item) routine\" is in a similar vain to Alexandra Anele's series but rather looks at it from a perspective of taking Instagram makeup and making it more everyday wear friendly.\n\nAs for cheaper products I can recommend which products you can go cheap with as a general rule:\n\n- Highlighter: seriously easy to get a good cheap highlighter. Revolution has some good ones, so does elf and BH cosmetics. Shimmery and glittery makeup in general is easier to make at a cheap price point. \n\n- Mascara: they go off so quickly and the effect on the lashes is at least 50% determined by the brush type (obvs this is not a real statistic, just guesstimating from my experiences) so it's more economical to try different brushes at drugstore prices. Plus the formula is generally easy to make at cheaper prices. I have heard great things from the Essence Lash Princess m\u00e1scara.\n\n- Black liquid eyeliner: NYX liquid liner is a favourite, but in general black liquid liner is so easy to come by at a cheap price point.\n\n- \"Natural\" / brown / nude eyeshadow: generally you don't want brown to be as pigmented to make a natural eye look, so you can go for cheaper prices in that regard.\n\n- Lipstick and lip liners: most popular colours (ie reds and beige nudes) are easier to find at a good price with good formula. I'd be surprised if you found yourself disappointed by a drugstore purchase of one of these. More out there colours like black, yellows and blues are much harder to find with a good formula at a cheap price and are generally better at a higher price point.\n\n- Things like foundation, face powders, primers, contour and bronzer are much more individual and will depend on your skin type and skin colour as to whether you can get good drugstore options. Some people's faces are sensitive to ingredients used in drugstore products, and some people I know essentially HAVE to go mid-range for that reason. Doesn't mean that there aren't options, just that I wouldn't say that you're guaranteed to be able to get all drugstore. Also a quick note on this topic - a good skincare routine will do wonders for a smooth makeup application. You can have the most perfect foundation but if your skincare is not up to par its not gonna look great.\n\nBest of luck in your makeup journey, and remember to have fun with it! :)", "created_utc": "1601292514.0", "edited": "False", "id": "g6xxosv", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_j0wvzj", "parent_id": "t3_j0wvzj", "score": "2", "subreddit": "Makeup", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qrwc"}, {"author": "KarmaKeepsMeHumble", "body": "God this unearthed a deep memory of a children's book I read when I was like 6? 7?

Don't own ABH so I can't really compare, but I'll say out of all my eyeshadows JSC is the softest. \n\nTwo great dry shadow formulas are Lethal Cosmetics (can personally vouch for that, they're great) and apparently Sugarpill! Dryer eyeshadow tends to last longer on the skin (and in my case not crease as bad) but not swatch all that great, the reverse is true for creamier formulas.\n\nAlso yes pressed eyeshadow refers to the powder being pressed into a pan. However the way it's done can affect the performance of the eyeshadows - for example, softly pressed eyeshadows tend to break much easier if you accidentally drop your palette (Melt is infamous for this iirc) whereas firmer pressed is a little more durable. In my experience however if the shadow is pressed too firmly the pigment doesn't really transfer onto the brush (again with the JSC palette).", "created_utc": "1601224145.0", "edited": "False", "id": "g6v0om8", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_iz1npm", "parent_id": "t1_g6rzbd4", "score": "2", "subreddit": "muacjdiscussion", "subreddit_id": "t5_342em"}, {"author": "KarmaKeepsMeHumble", "body": "- As little product as I can get away with on the eyelids - so I don't put concealer/foundation on eyelids only eye primer, and then setting said primer with either eyeshadow or, if I wanna go really natural, a light wash of loose setting powder. \n\n- Eye primer is your friend. Watch Robert Welsh who talks about why products crease on the eyelids and the difference between concealer and eye primer.\n\n- Dry eyeshadow formulas - a little hard to explain, but you know when influencers call an eyeshadow \"buttery\" and that kind of lark? Not great for oily lids bc that means the formula has something oily in it to make it that smooth to the touch feeling. Dry eyeshadows don't get as much love bc 1) they don't feel as nice and 2) they don't swatch well. Lethal Cosmetics has become my favourite eyeshadow brand for this reason - I put it on (with an eye primer base of course) and it does not crease at all. Big fan. Been wanting to try out Sugarpill for that reason - always heard them described as a \"dry\" formula, which suggests to me that it would also stay on for longer.\n\n- Beware what eyecream/skincare you're putting on your lids. In my experience, putting anything that has oil formulated in it on my lids WILL lead to creasing regardless of what makeup products I put on top.

I'm based in Europe so maybe some things I'm recommending won't be available in New Zealand, but I'll throw them out there just in case!\n\n- Yellow eyeshadow: ah, the bane of many yellow-loving makeup peoples, it's one of the harder colours to formulate. I personally can only vouch for Kiko milano's high pigment wet and dry eyeshadow single in 19 (a matte, warm toned/marigold yellow) - very nice, big pan which can be used as a blush as well. I don't have any fully yellow palettes but I've heard good things about Colourpop's yellow monochromatic palette as well as the Midas Cosmetics's Lemonade palette. Another recommendation for single eyeshadows is Lethal Cosmetics - I've never tried their yellow singles, but I've ordered some greens and a bright pink from them and they've been fantastic, and I've heard that their quality is a lot more consistent across different shades than other brands are. Edit: omg I forgot Colored Raine! I've been eying them for a while, apparently their shadows are fantastic and I've heard a lot of people rave about their yellows. \n\n- Coloured liners: now here are some things I know and love! Right off the bat I recommend Lethal Cosmetics FX Gel Liners that they've released this year - I've only tried the white, black and neon pink (which is a UV liner - one of the 4 they've released), but again I've heard they are consistent across the board. Once dried it doesn't crack nor does it come off unless you want it to, they're great. However if you want something cheaper, NYX Vivid Brights eyeliner is a great dip into coloured liner, with a brush tip applicator that's super fine. Cracks a little if you layer it on too much, but still it's pretty good. I had a blue felt tip eyeliner that started my love for coloured liner, but for the life of me I cannot remember what brand it was from, only that it was drugstore :(  Another quick recommendation: the Rimmel Wonder'swipe Liner and eyeshadow, specifically in the shade Instafamous (I hate the name, but it's a gorgeous gold liquid liner type thing) as all other shades are, imo, trash. Put on the gold liner, and then set it with a gold eyeshadow on an angled brush and you'll look... *chefs kiss* I love that thing.\n\n- Pastel palette: I don't own pastels myself since I like brights more, but I've heard good things about the Pastel Pup palette by Managerie Cosmetics. Again, Lethal Cosmetics has pastel singles. Sugarpill's Fun Size palette is also apparently more pastel leaning, but I haven't tried it myself despite side eying it since it came out. A cheaper alternative is Beauty Bay's own-brand pastel palette. Or which I would suggest might be a better idea - mix your eyeshadow with white to create a pastel. You can do that either by dipping your brush into the colour you want and then a white to lighten it to a pastel. Or you can scrape a little of colour and the white onto a dish, grind them together to make a loose eyeshadow and then dip into it to apply to lids. A bit more effort, but imo it's better to see if you actually like pastels on your eyes before spending money on a palette you may not like.\n\nHope this helped!

I had a similar situation with my ex, dated them for a whole year and ended it in 2018. Like you, they mistreated me (and it fucked me up a little) but I also knew that it was coming from a place of pain. Doesn't make it any better, but this is also a person you invested in (emotionally, time wise, monitarily etc) for period of time. That doesn't go away quickly. I still haven't dated anyone new, or really tried - I know they has, but I haven't (which is grating for a whole bunch of reasons, but not due to jealousy on my part).\n\nGetting over someone is hard anyway - when mistreatment is added to the mix it becomes a mental mine field sometimes. It's easy for other people from the outside looking in to say \"well, they're a piece of shit, don't love them\" but you're the one who spent time with them, and have seen them at their best and worse. With the mistreatment there's also usually a lot of emotional manipulation to go through - that shit traumatises you somewhat, and trauma isn't fixed at any specific date.\n\nTbh I don't regret taking my time, and still taking my time now - better to heal, grow and learn on your own rather than date someone just for the sake of it. I've never seen that end well - at best, you fuck yourself up in the long run and at worst (and most likely) you hurt someone unrelated in the process. If you don't want to date out of fear, that's fine - just keep an eye on it so that the fear doesn't become an emotion that controls you by limiting you (easier said than done, I'm in the process of that now). Learn from your experience dating them - were there warning signs for the mistreatment? Did they say/do something that you ignored, but in hindsight is a red flag? If you can't give yourself that perspective, read psychology studies or relationship books that outline signs of future abusive behaviour and see if you can see it then - and recognise it again. That's a more productive and safe thing to do, than go into dating just because there's an expectation that you 'should'. \n\nLong story short, it's fine. What you're saying is all fine - so long as you hurt no one else, and aren't hurting yourself by trying too soon, it's fine. And it'll be okay, the feelings will fade at some point (probably the more you examine that mistreatment). It isn't easy, and it certainly isn't simple, but it is (or at least it will be) okay.

Here's some tricks to get them under control:\n\n- Exfoliate regularly. This is absolutely essential - there's no getting around that with sebaceous filaments. Physical exfoliate if you have nothing else, but both types of chemical exfoliants (AHA and BHA) are better long-term for your skin (less micro-tearing and scarring) and imo better at managing pores and oils. I assume that you cleanse your skin every day (even when you haven't worn makeup), but I've personally found the double cleaning method to be effective - to an extent where I can go for longer without exfoliating if I keep up my cleansing routine.\n\n- Clay masks, especially if they have tea tree oil formulated in them. This is like a once a month kinda deal, and tbh if you have a good cleansing and exfoliation routine this is more of a \"oh my skin's acting up, it needs a little extra tlc today\" thing. Not strictly necessary, but nice to have.\n\n- Niacinamide. I haven't personally tried a Niacinamide specific product, so I can't really speak on it too much, but I've heard very good things about it and it's an ingredient that doesn't interfere with most other ingredients so its worth a shot.\n\n- This last one is a little more specific to myself, but I'll put it out there: Jojoba oil in the evenings as a last step. I'm oily/combo and find that my oils (and therefore my sebaceous filaments) are less prominent since I've started using it, because it's the oil that most closely mimics our natural skin oils. Sorta tricks your skin into thinking its produced enough oil (and therefore doesn't fill out the filaments).

So really harsh cleansers usually make the problem worse even though it feels great straight after cleansing. Same thing with exfoliators. If you don't have a cleansing routine already, I suggest the double cleanse method (oil cleanser followed by a water-based cleanser) and a chemical exfoliator, particularly a BHA for oily skin (there's a great one by Cosrx).\n\nAs for the jojoba oil - it's almost like signalling yo your skin that you have oil on your face already, no need to make more. It's the oil that most closely mimics the skin's natural oils. It's not something for the day time really if you're planning on wearing any makeup, but at night it's fantastic - just slather it on and the next morning it looks great.

It'll also be a little sad, and maybe a little angry, I cannot tell yet. \n\nYou've asked for instance where I loved a partner more than they loved me, and I have that kind of story. However, before I go into it, I would like to recount a conversation I had with my partner (I'll call them T from here on out) when we were still together.\n\nWe were together for a little over a year in total. They were my first ever romantic relationship. It was bad towards the latter half of the relationship - constant fights, feeling like I was walking on eggshells, I endured  a lot of verbal abuse and emotional manipulation (although I believe that T was doing so subconsciously). One of those instances of emotional manipulation was a conversation we had on love, or rather how to love - T's view was similar to yours, that you loved wholeheartedly, gave everything to you SO and that would be returned. You need each other - that was love to T. I disagreed and said that love was you both being independent and you meet in the middle, that you fit and elevate one another but you are two distinct wholes. You didn't NEED one another, you WANTED one another. You choose the other person, and continue choosing them - that's love to me. I stand by that now, but didn't at the time and I regret that pretty heartily. So T convinced me that my love wasn't love, that it was too cold and detached and not being WHOLE. \n\nSo I decided to do it T's way. Molded my schedule to theirs, ignored friends and family to prioritise them, would take the brunt of their jealous fits by taking it rather than standing up to them. I think part of it was that I was tired of fighting, and thought maybe loving them in their way, the way they saw it and the way I thought they would recognise it, would make them happy. Would make us happy. Would finally make me happy again - because I loved T, but I wasn't happy with them. It took me a long time to recognise the difference.\n\nSo I did all of that, gave and gave and gave so much time, money and energy out of love. And perhaps this wouldn't be a problem, if they had reciprocated in kind. I was constantly appeasing T, but that same courtesy was never returned, so I was a well being run dry with no rain to soothe the cracking earth. We did activities they wanted to do whilst my ideas were shot down, we listened to their music because my taste was shit (according to them), I got complained at and to if an event didn't turn out the way they wanted. If we did something I would enjoy, T grumbled and complained the whole time. Even worse - the verbal abuse got worse through constant belittlement, the fights got more frequent and I got quieter. The more we fought, the harder I loved T in hopes it would help, because they said I didn't love them enough (that I still didn't spend enough time with T, that I still wasn't prioritising them). Whatever concessions I made, they weren't enough. It is as you said - love isn't measurable, so in their eyes it wasn't enough because they didn't feel better (at least I learnt that no inner happiness can be linked to a person not yourself - they can help and love, but no amount of external emotion will help your inner one's). My love wasn't enough, therefore I wasn't enough.\n\nEventually I realised that I was essentially killing myself in the worst way possible. Breaking up with them was the worst thing because I knew that I loved them more than they did me, but they needed me more than I needed them, and I had molded myself to soothe every need they had. So it was hard to be a thing that hurt them, but my soul was dying.\n\nComing out on the other side was even rougher though. Breaking up felt like a stab, being myself afterwards felt like peeling my skin back together with safety pins. Still feels like it sometimes. I had poured so much love into T that I didn't recognise who I was anymore, because for little over 6 months all I was, was someone who was needed and gave all love to one person. That's not natural, it isn't admirable or good or sacrificing - it is degrading you to how useful you are, in a fucked contest of measuring love where you will always lose.\n\nAnyway, to come to an end with this post I will a ser your questions directly:\n\n- do you give your all loving a person or leave some for yourself? I did give my all loving someone and it came with the cost of deep scars. I would say it is vital that you have love for yourself, you are the one living in YOUR body, in YOUR life. \"Wherever I go, there I am.\" Going back to what I actually believe in that love is - you are a COUPLE, a PAIR, not a WHOLE. There's a reason why relationships are described in those terms. You are individual people that have hobbies, dreams, aspirations, likes and dislikes - it just so happens that two individuals happen to fit. That doesn't take away your individuality, and if you stop loving yourself in even the most basic sense of doing things because YOU want to then what the point of being alive, or being with that person if you can't enjoy your short time on earth together? You have to love yourself, because you are first and foremost the person living your own life.\n\n- How do you manage to balance the two? From my story, I'm might not be the best person to ask but - if you don't love each other equally, the way I see it you're doomed to fail in some form or another. However, if you're asking to balance between loving someone else and loving yourself - that isn't hard if you are with people on your wavelength. I have deeply loved friends and relatives, and could love myself because they saw someone they loved, not someone that didn't love them anough.\n\nThe thing is, if the love is unbalanced between two people in a relationship then you cannot balance the love for yourself and other people. I think that was the case between me and T - I don't think T was really malicious, but something fundamentally just did not click, and I bent myself out of shape trying to make it so. T needed someone, I wanted someone, and that isn't as compatible as one would have you believe at first.\n\nI believe I've rambled on for too long, sorry about that and if the tone was a little too negative.

I'm a smoker myself and had switched to vaping a couple of months ago, but fell back into it due to stress unfortunately. s a quick bit of advice on that front - just like saying it's best to not even smoke one cigarette in case you get addicted, the same goes for falling back into it. It's never just one cigarette, it's usually the beginning of a chain. Just my two cents! That being said, I'd stopped for about 3 months and some things of note were this:\n\n- breathing became a lot easier after around 1 month. Not just in terms of being less out of breath when doing physical activities, but also being able to take deep breaths without feeling like you're fighting your own rib cage.\n\n- bowel movements aren't as intense anymore; when you're smoking it's generally followed by minor diarrhoea, when quitting there's a while where you're constipated, but after that point you won't have stomach pains or a pressing need to go to the toilet as often. Since I've started again it's truly a case of \"don't know what you have until it's gone\"\n\n- less lethargy, not just after a cig but also in general you'll have more eneegy; I suspect because your body isn't trying to process poison 24/7, so you'll just find yourself a little clearer-headed and energetic.\n\nThe subreddit r/stopsmoking is a great resource for those wanting to stop smoking - people motivating each other and themselves, detailing other positive benefits from quitting.

And then I couldn't be stopped. \n\nI would say Young Adult is generally some of the easiest to get into - the writing is generally easy to understand, and there's a huge variety of genres within that category.\n\nThe best thing I can tell you - just start reading, ideally by borrowing books from the library. You don't really want to be spending money if you aren't sure you're gonna actually read it. See if the premise interests you and try reading the first couple of pages or even the first chapter if you can, and go from there - don't like it? Borrow another book and try again. If you do like it? Awesome, finish it and see if you can find books from the same author to read, or books that are a similar genre/premise.\n\nAs for my personal recommendations:\n\n- Phillip Pullman's His Dark Materials series. Fantasy. First book is called Golden Compass or Northern Lights (depends on where you're from). It was the series that got me into reading when I was a teenager and it still holds up now that I am an adult.\n\n- Brandon Sanderson's Mistborn Trilogy. Fantasy. His books are generally recommended for fantasy beginners, and he is on the forefront of contemporary fantasy writing as far as I understand it. The magic system is really intriguing and the characters are incredibly likable.\n\n- Vanessa Diffenbaugh's The Language of Flowers. Stand-alone novel, romance. Here's a non-fantasy recommendation, and one of the very few romance-heavy books I've ever enjoyed, mainly because the romance isn't too in your face and imo not really the focus - more about growing up and navigating in the adult world when you don't understand it particularly well, nor can you communicate within it well either. Not everyone's cup of tea, but I've enjoyed it.\n\n(edit: also wanted to add that manga, comic books, manhwa and webtoons are also good and easy ways to get into reading more consistently!

So yes, it is objectification. And yes, the fact that it is so popular and becoming so widely known is promoting it. \n\nI think the more interesting question might be whether it is empowering, because that's a lot harder to quantify or even define as to what that means and what exactly that entails. On the one hand, those women are getting paid and are doing it on their own volition. That's already a lot better than some other circumstances there are (looking at you porn industry and human trafficking), and those women can then spend that money to further career goals or simply to remain afloat (esp rn with corona and jibs being sparse). On the other hand, that objectification can have a lot of wide-reaching and potentially severely negative impact on women as a whole. So it's not empowering in that regard.\n\nBut then again, it is also a matter of demand and supply - there's always a demand for it, and these individuals are willing to meet that by supplying.

The fact that bastards are considered a \"bad\" thing is to some extent a Western thing, or rather comes down to specific cultural understandings of lineage or what resources are available - some cultures have the concept that children are raised by the whole society, or by the whole family, thereby making blood lineage less all-important; and societies where polygamy was practiced it was a parent that had the economic resources to raise multiple children with different parents. \n\nIf we think about monogamy in terms of marriage (a la religion) then really monogamy was more of a business transaction than anything else.

Someone else had pointed out that a lot of energy was spent on worrying instead of creating, which is true, but you clearly have ideas just not the physical 'presence' or motivation (for the lack of better words) to do so.

So do something that really relaxes you, doesn't matter what it is - for me, I've been taking 1 to 1.5 hour baths with bath salts, lavender essence and music. The whole nine yards. I do a whole skin/body/hair care routine afterwards, takes up another hour. It's time intensive and for a long while I thought I was wasting time.

I didn't want to write, found myself procrastinating on it pretty hardcore. But this week I finally started doing something I've been wanting to do for a long time - learn Japanese. So I've been memorising the hiragana writing system, and I realised I hadn't had to memorise something in at least 2 years. Now I'm suddenly finding myself willing to sit down and do those writing deadlines occasionally (instead of forcing myself always). Maybe find a new skill to learn, or a new technique in one of the creative outlets you have (EG if you write poetry, try writing a haiku! If it's novels, try a short story or try to write one sentence you really like the sound of) - it can get the ball rolling, or at the very least you'll have tried something and that's also fantastic! \n\n\nTo answer your question though: I'm writing some themed poetry right now that I'm vaguely considering of publishing as a collective - tying into a wider \"story\" arc. It occurred to me yesterday when I was bathing funnily enough, but I've been really enjoying the process so far. What is an idea you've had (since you mentioned in your post that you have some!)?", "created_utc": "1597046476.0", "edited": "False", "id": "g0z3jhg", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_i6wg06", "parent_id": "t3_i6wg06", "score": "1", "subreddit": "CasualConversation", "subreddit_id": "t5_323oy"}, {"author": "KarmaKeepsMeHumble", "body": "I also read and enjoy too much BS, so I second The Host being good, despite disliking Stephanie Mayer's work in general. It's the only \"love triangle\" that I've ever enjoyed as far as I can think of it, because the conflicting emotions made sense. There is, as you say, the fact that it is two couples and a case of just being in the same body, but also the fact how Wanda is influenced by Mel's memories of Jared, and how Jared is confused by his attraction to Mel's body vs his dislike of Wanda/souls, which creates natural tension, confusion and resolution in the character arcs and plot. There is history between characters personalities as well as between their individual bodies, and so the triangle makes sense and is satisfying, because the tension is natural in the setting it takes place in.\n\nThe Katniss/Peeta/Gale felt like the romantic subplot was added to pad, in some ways, like it feels a lot of series do. It's been a couple of years since I read the Hunger Games, but didn't the Katniss/Peeta romance only really happen because they dated for PR and that was one of the few reasons Katniss ever considered him romantically? Idk I can only for sure remember that I was boredly rolling my eyes at the whole thing majority of the time, whereas with The Host I found myself much more interested in the inter-character dynamics. Maybe also because it was a more interesting premise?\n\nAs for the Device series.... Eh, that's how I felt about it - both about the relationship and the series in general tbh. I only remember enjoying the resolution of it, because it felt similar to a poly relationship - she never liked one better than the other (as far as I remember - again read it years ago), it was just a matter of the circumstances not permitting it. And as you say, the two guys actually LIKED and respected each other so that immediately made it a lot more tolerable in my eyes because no one was being an asshole outright.\n\nGonna check out Girl Genious now tho!\n\nThank you for coming to my responding \"reading and thinking about too much BS\" talk.", "created_utc": "1596465184.0", "edited": "False", "id": "g07lo6y", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_i2o8xx", "parent_id": "t1_g06kbs2", "score": "5", "subreddit": "aaaaaaacccccccce", "subreddit_id": "t5_3aa11"}, {"author": "KarmaKeepsMeHumble", "body": "Did you go as a tourist to Japan before moving there?

The moment that a privilege isn't a privilege anymore is when it is available to everyone, or at the very least to a majority. That's the goal, in a way. \n\nAlso, whilst I understand the concept of feeling of guilt accompanied with being privileged, I think that's a result from how privilege is discussed on the Internet. I think a lot of the times people point at those privileged and say \"God look how privileged they are\" in a somewhat salty way. The way I see it, that causes the guilt sort of feeling, because you can't help being privileged; folding on yourself and clamming up.

I'll be honest I'm one of those people that just drops dead most of the time, but I have some advice to give. Here's some generic advice: meditation, a consistent bed time routine (look up sleep hygiene), take a shower. For me personally, I do my daily skin care routine (sometimes I forget which doesn't affect me falling asleep, but does make me feel bad in the morning so I try to do it consistently), where I do a sort of visualising exercise - I imagine when I'm cleaning my face that I'm taking of all my negative thoughts out of my pores and wash them down the drain. And then when I'm putting on my toner, serum etc I imagine rubbing happiness into my skin. Sounds silly but it makes me feel better. Even without that, just massaging your face feels nice and relaxing. I always put on a video when I actually lie down - not asmr (has the opposite effect of relaxing me), just a YouTuber whose voice I like and who's video I've already watched (so I'm not having to actively listen).\n\nOn worse days, I put on some calming music (my go-to is the band Hang Massive, especially their song The Secret Kissing of the Sun and Moon), I light something that smells good (a candle or incense, Nag Champa or something with lavender) and have some coloured lighting.

That I have tried myself which is the single shadow July Lime from 3 Concept Eyes, you can find their stuff on YesStyle, to get free shipping is pretty high atm due to corona and it will take a while to arrive (before corona it was between 2-3 weeks, idk what it would be now). Also that shade sometimes doesn't show up on the website (I think when it's sold out?) but it isn't discontinued or anything. Seems to be what you're looking for since the shade is technically lime, but the pigmentation makes it such that it seems more yellow-green/chartreuse unless you really pack it on. My personal opinion: it's fine and gets the job done, but for \u00a37 I was expecting more. \n\n2. LETHAL COSMETICS! They're a German indie brand that's vegan, cruelty free and with ethical mica. Their shades Relapse or Replica could fit what you're looking for. I haven't tried either of those shades, but I've tried two of their green matte shades (one mid-tone, the other dark green) and I love them. From what I've heard from others, their quality is really consistent across their range. They cost around 5-6\u20ac if I remember correctly (they're 5.50 in British pound). Plus, they're actual single shades that you can put into a magnetic palette, rather than July Lime which comes in its own compact and you can't take it out.\n\n- I just read that you want to make a lipstick out of it - if you don't mind spending more money, lethal cosmetics also has Gel Liners that are really creamy and that mix together beautifully. There is a green and a yellow that you could mix to create the exact shade that you want! Again, I haven't tried those exact colours but I have used 2 of the gel liners as lipstick and they feel similar to a liquid lipstick, but I don't have much experience making Frankenmakeup with cream products or making lipstick, so I can't speak on that. But, thought I should mention in just in case! :) \n\nAs for advice to make eyeshadows show up - a tacky eyeshadow primer, or any lighter cream underneath. You can use concealer, although that will crease if you have oilier eyelids like I do. Best way of getting pigmentation is by applying a white base to your eye, think something like the NYX Jumbo eye pencil in white (I think the shade is called Milk?).\n\nHope this helped and hope you manage to find what you're looking for!", "created_utc": "1594365736.0", "edited": "False", "id": "fxicjf6", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_hojtfs", "parent_id": "t3_hojtfs", "score": "1", "subreddit": "MakeupAddiction", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rww2"}, {"author": "KarmaKeepsMeHumble", "body": "Featuring:\n\n- 3 of the new SIDE FX Gel Liners, left to right: Bitcrush (pink UV), Redux (black), Buffer (white)\n\n- 4 eyeshadows, top to bottom and left to right: Habitat (matte dark green), Eden (matte mid-tone green), Capslock (hot pink), Vertex (light green, shimmer)\n\n- After Dark Collection sticker sheet", "created_utc": "1594324659.0", "edited": "False", "id": "fxggtr2", "is_submitter": "True", "link_id": "t3_ho9yg7", "parent_id": "t3_ho9yg7", "score": "2", "subreddit": "makeupflatlays", "subreddit_id": "t5_3humn"}, {"author": "KarmaKeepsMeHumble", "body": "I've stopped biting my nails this year as well and although I fall back into it sometimes I find that nail polish helps sooo much with the urges.

I've moved a couple of times in my life, and now am on the cusp of moving again, or rather entering a new chapter in life.\n\nI think the first thing to say is - why not contact them and have a catch up? They might be in the same boat as you, thinking back on those times and wistfully thinking of seeing what happened with your life. The worst thing they could say is no, the worst thing that could happen is that it's a bit awkward if you do speak with/meet each other. Granted, this is much easier said than done, because even as I know these things my anxious brain still makes it impossible to reach out to them. Maybe some day.\n\nBut I would say the main thing I've found is that relationships are transient. Whether through distance, time, death or change people grow apart. Be grateful to what those people meant to you then, how they've shaped you into the person you are today. For example, I haven't seen or spoken to a dear friend of mine in 8 years. Doesn't change the fact that I love her, or that I probably wouldn't be alive today without her friendship, or that I will always admire the kindness and strength she held herself with. Maybe that has changed now that it's almost a decade later, but doesn't change the memories I have of her, or the way I see the world now because of her.\n\nJust like you don't admire the dusk or the dawn just because of the colours, you don't just feel happy because your friends make you feel the good. You feel happy because at that moment it's something special. Many dusks and many dawns will fade just like friends will come and go, but the beauty of it never diminishes. Appreciate the beauty for what it is - a precise, particular moment in time, suspended in the Amber of your memories. \n\nI remember once reading somewhere \"I wish there was a way of knowing when you're still in 'the good old days'\" and that stuck with me. Every day is technically \"the good old days\", even if it sometimes/often doesn't feel that way.

If anything, imperial colonialism is a huge aspect as to why there is so much widespread homophobia in a lot of the world, due to Christian beliefs being shoved down the throats of colonies (and let's not forget being used as a tool to justify said colonialism). \n\nHomosexuality, trans people, gender fluidity (as we would define and categorise them now in the west) etc have been observed and documented in a variety of cultures across time. Some quick examples include: ancient China had widely accepted homosexual relationships (at one point even marriage was accepted if I remember correctly), ancient Greece has a plethora of examples of gay relationships between soldiers/brothers in arms, hijras in the sub-indian continent were seen as a valid third gender that was neither male nor female. \n\nOne could argue that the way we perceive homosexuality, and how people express their homosexuality, is partially informed by the anglosphere nowadays, yes - the Internet, traditional media and the like have a particular way of presenting \"gay-ness\". The Internet makes those things accessible, and like it or not English is a widely spoken second language, and a lot of English media is consumed by people outside of the anglosphere. Especially by people who live in homophobic countries - they do not have media representation of queer/gay people (or at least not positive) in their indigenous/local/national societies, so they turn towards English media (again bc it is usually the most accessible not just in terms of finding it, but also bc English is taught as a second language early on in a lot of places). \n\nSo it makes sense that some of the vernacular seeps into the non-English language - especially since a lot of the vernacular tied to \"gay\" way of talking comes from drag culture, which at least in the west nowadays is intrinsically tied to homosexuality and the wider LGTB+ community (I'm specifically thinking of Rupaul's Drag Race here and its widespread impact across different cultures).\n\nGranted, THAT you could make the argument is imperialism - at the very least, the widespread use of English is a result of imperial colonialism, that's the whole reason why it is accessible/taught to so many people around the world. Also with how relationships and experiences are categorised as homosexual/bisexual/trans etc, certainly - those are relatively new terms, but the behaviours and examples have always existed even without that kind of specific terminology to refer to them with. But that's a whole different conversation tbh, bottom line is:\n\nHOMOSEXUALITY (AND LGBT+ AS A WHOLE) HAS EXISTED, Exists AND WILL CONTINUE TO EXIST IN SPITE OF, NOT BECAUSE OF IMPERIALISM. \n\nTLDR: homosexuality isn't imposed by \"cultural imperialism of the anglosphere\", there is documentation and evidence to show that it has existed and will continue to exist regardless of culture or time.

If you're having consistent panic attacks or spiral into moods that could be dangerous for you or other people, then I would say definitely get professional help.\n\nThat being said, go to the basics: food, exercise, sleep. \n\nIn terms of food, find things that have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties (turmeric is an excellent ingredient for this bc of curcumin, have a quick Google search on it). I cannot remember the exact science behind it, but essentially stress causes the body to be inflamed and it creates a vicious cycle of the inflammation worsening stress and the stress worsening inflammation and so on (related note: Excessive weight, in terms of fat deposits, also inflames the body). Essentially a well-balanced diet will help you: get more fibre (helps with inflammation and aids your digestion so: eat whole fruit, not juice, and buy wholemeal rice/bread/etc) and omega 3 (good for brain health and therefore seratonin=feel better so: fish, chia seeds etc) in you, complex carbohydrates, veggies, protein. Stay away from saturated fats, trans fats, too much salt, etc. Also reduce caffeine intake, its been shown to worsen anxiety - an alternative is green tea or matcha (again, full of antioxidants and gives a gentler kick of caffeine). \n\nAs mentioned, having too much fat deposits also adds to inflammation in the body. Exercise releases dopamine, also helps alleviate the jittery-Ness that can come with anxiety, aids with sleep.\n\nSleep is HUGELY important for the brain, there is so much out there detailing the benefits of good sleep that I won't bother to go into rn. But, make your room conducive to that - associate the bed with just sleep (so no playing on your phone or working whilst lying in bed), be aware of how much light you expose yourself to before going to bed, try and get 8 hours of uninterrupted sleep every/most nights, have a consistent sleeping and waking up time (linked to your circadian rhythm), etc.\n\nI see a lot of people have answered you with journaling/meditating/mindfulness and don't get me wrong, those are also great methods and resources to help with anxiety. But the brain is still in the body, and if you're not nourishing your body then your mind isn't nourished either. Plus, those are all things that require a baseline with anxiety where you can even bring yourself to start, and that is very difficult if your basics aren't in place. I'm saying this as someone who's in the same shoes as you. I won't make claims that good sleep/exercise/diet will treat anxiety, but it should at least help a little - it has done a lot for me to get into the Headspace to confront my anxious/depressive thoughts. \n\nIf you want information regarding what I've been saying here, most of it for me came from two podcasts: Feel Better Live More (hosted by Dr Chatterjee) and The Brain Warrior's Way (hosted by Dr Amen and his wife [I think she's a nurse?]). Both Podcasts take a very holistic view on wellness and health (and not \"holistic\" in terms of scented oils and energy crystals or whatever fad pseudoscience bull) - encompassing actionable steps to help improve your health. I would recommend the FBLM podcast over TBWW only bc I'm more familiar with it and have not been disappointed following the advice I'd gotten from there. \n\nHope this helps.

I'm still somewhat of a cuticle biter, but I've gotten much better now so maybe some of these things can help!\n\nFirst thing I would say is what feeling of anxiousness prompts the cuticle biting? I found for myself that it was a response to me putting something off--the longer I did, the worse the cuticles would become. Or I would remember a long list of to dos one night and decimate my fingers. So once I noticed that, I keyed into the feeling and would try to do armchair CBT sorta like \"you've put it off so far and the world hasnt ended, so it is not the worst thing, instead of biting cuticles I'll try and complete one thing off the to do.\" Nail/cuticle biting is a self-soothing thing, not actually a solution - so try to find ways to address the solution when you're anxious rather than just fucking up your hands. But it might just be more general feeling of anxiety for you, which is fine, but I thought I should throw this out there just in case. \n\nSecond thing I found difficult is that I'd do it when I was bored. That was harder to address, and I actually came by the solution by accident - I tried fake nails one time, and realised that I liked the look of long nails A LOT and I realised I wanted that all of the time. So once the fake nails pinged off, I did maintenance on my nails and cuticles - because I found feeling the uneven texture and bits of skin a trigger to start mauling them, and that when I wore the fake nails it was a physical reminder to leave my fingers out of my mouth. So I got a pair of cuticle cutters and something flat-ish to push back the cuticles so I could cut them (easier when your hands are pruny from water), and flatten the edges of the chunks of skin I've bitten away, to make them look somewhat presentable when I look at them. Then I applied a clear base coat on my nails as a shiny, physical reminder (similar purpose to the fake nails) since I didn't want to accidentally ingest nail polish.\n\nIf you aren't in a position to be able to maintain your nails without judgement (I understand how that might not be an option if your not a woman), put anything physical over your nails and cuticles. Plasters. Gloves. Bandages. Doesn't matter, as long as it is a physical barrier, so long as the sensation of something other than your cuticle/nail reaches your lips to remind you to leave it alone.\n\nThe extent of my damage was around the severity of the picture, and you said its worse so it might be worth to have a replacement for cuticle biting. I was able to kick it with those tricks mentioned above, but I did find that doing something with my mouth was the way I just personally self-soothe, rather than the sensation of doing something with my hands (hence why stress balls never worked for me either) so find something else to do with your mouth. Chew gum. Bite on your knuckles. Chew on a pen. A string from your hoodie. Whatever it is, something to replace the soothing sensation of something in your mouth.\n\nSo I guess tl:Dr get a physical barrier and reminder between your cuticles/nails and your mouth, and find a replacement for the sensation of something in your mouth.\n\nIt's a really difficult habit to get rid of, so please don't be too harsh on yourself if you find you slip back into it (I sometimes still do) - but I'm certain you will get there eventually!

I'll try and explain this as well as I can, I apologise in advance if this comment doesn't answer your questions. Also I got into a lot of detail, it's not meant to be patronising or anything, but there terms are so interlinked with each other that I felt it might be beneficial to really break it down as much as possible. Please feel free to ask me more questions and for clarification for any point :)\n\nFirst of all, asexuality is an umbrella term - technically demisexuality, grey-ace etc are more specific subcategories of asexuality. So you are kinda correct in saying that an asexual with a high libido is still asexual, but libido is not the same as sexual attraction and having a high libido as an asexual therefore does not make you a demisexual.\n\nAsexuality means, as a general term, that you do not experience sexual attraction. Demisexuality is the subcategory and term for people who do not experience sexual attraction *unless* there is an emotional bond (so simply asexual until x came along and you connected, now they are sexually attracted to x). Virtually the same thing, just a distinction of sexual attraction being possible for demis in a particular circumstance (there's other asexual subcategories that distinguish if, and if yes when/how/why an asexual might feel sexual attraction, but I won't get into that). Now libido is a little more difficult to define - according to Wikipedia, it is \"a desire for sexual activities\". There's nothing inherently within libido that implies there has to be sexual attraction, just that you are interested in and want to have/experience sex. Perhaps it might be easier to just think of it as wanting orgasms (?). \n\nA good analogy that I'd seen someone use years ago to describe the distinction between libido and asexuality (the demisexual bit is my own add-on):\n\nYou know those times where you are hungry, but don't feel like eating anything in particular? That's the equivalent of an asexual with a libido. Now the difference between an asexual (not being interested in 'eating' anything in particular) and a demisexual in this analogy is that you are hungry, but you've spied the chocolate in the drawer and now that you've looked at it long enough you think, 'I'm suddenly hungry for specifically chocolate, and only chocolate' (the analogy of connecting a bond - although of course that's not the direct equivalent of having a deep emotional bond with someone lol). Nothing else in the kitchen appealed to you to eat in the first place despite your hunger, but now that you've looked at a food long enough your hunger is directed. \n\n\n\nTl:Dr asexuality is an umbrella term in which demisexuality is included. Both terms are separate from libido. Libido is a want for sex - asexual just means it is undirected, whereas for demis it is very specific. Therefore identifying as asexual and having a high libido does not equate to demisexuality, as libido is separate from sexual orientation.", "created_utc": "1589157405.0", "edited": "False", "id": "fq82wza", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_g59y0l", "parent_id": "t1_fo5hxa7", "score": "5", "subreddit": "demisexuality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s5lq"}, {"author": "KarmaKeepsMeHumble", "body": "Not the person you were asking, but I'm cap sun and Leo moon as well!

With those people, once we mentioned our mental health issues to each other (that were similar in a lot of ways) that's all we ended up talking about when we saw/messaged each other. About suicidal thoughts, and depression, and anxiety, and how lulls in the conversation were us \"dissassociating\" and all of that - like, yeah, it was great at the beginning to know that someone understood, but when that's all there is too it? That drains you. Any time any of us reached out to another it was so one of us could calm down an anxiety attack, or make them feel better about themselves because they're going through a depressive episode etc. Nothing else.\n\nI ended up distancing myself from those three, as much as it hurt.

What about hobbies, funny stories, dreams, aspirations (beyond 'gee, I hope I don't fail this class bc of depression'), series you enjoy, books, something you learned that day - literally ANYTHING else. It felt like a disservice not just to myself, but also to them - there's more to people than their mental health problems.

Plus if you have a food lifestyle filled with processed foods then it is close to impossible to cut out excessive sugar since its usually added to 'improve' taste. \n\nI have a sweet tooth a mile wide, and had a weakness towards chocolate bars (I would eat one or two every day or every other one). But nonetheless I managed to significantly cut down on it in the last year by simply by not buying any chocolate bars, cookies, etc, since I can eat a whole packet of anything with chocolate in one sitting. Instead I found ways to give me a sweet taste with minimal sugar and more nutritional benefits.\n\nIf you drink soft drinks, cut them out and instead drink mint tea or lemon water with mint leaves in it. If you enjoy coffee with a lot of sugar, try adding a bit of vanilla essence to give a bit of a sweet kick (and/or, if you enjoy coffee made in a cafetiere, adding around a teaspoon of ground cinnamon with ground beans and before adding the coffee). Vanilla essence and cinnamon in general was a lifesaver when it came to cutting down on sugar. \n\nInstead of drinking juice, eat actual fruit. The juicing process takes away the fibre and although you get vitamins/minerals, you are able to drink more juice than you can eat fruit due to the fullness that fibre with give you - leading you to consume far more sugar than you would realistically want to.\n\nI think when one has been used to consuming a lot sugar, and thereby becomes used to sweetness, it might be more conducive to find alternatives first that quench the need for sweetness and slowly reducing your intake as time goes on. For me it was a matter of not buying anything with chocolate in it, and then quenching my want for sweetness in other, more healthier ways (at least nutritionally). \n\nSugar is hard to get rid of, but possible!

Also congrats for trying something new and stepping out of your (I assume) comfort zone!\n\nI think my favourite thing about this look is the blue blush/contour on your cheek, it looks very clean and the position/angle of it is really nice. Dare I say that it is a very natural looking, as much as blue can be natural on skin haha. I also enjoy how you've paired the look with the white liner in strategic places to emphasise the blue and the shape of your face.\n\nSince you're open to CC, the parts which I think could be better and complete the look come down to blending. In particular, your brow bone highlight and your nose contour, in just is a tad too evident that they are splotches of colour, rather than integrating with your skin tone.\n\nWith your brow bone highlight, it almost feels like you completed the eye look and then added the highlight and didn't properly blend it in. Mainly evidenced by the way there seems to be an opaque white line right under the eyebrow (where I assume you carved our the shape) and that the edge of the eyeshadow seems muddled/muted. That is to say, rather than your brow bone looking like it's protruding (and thereby lighter/catching the light) and that you've decided to apply blue eyeshadow on it, it looks like you've applied eyeshadow and then felt like you should put a highlight there because that's how makeup is done. Which is not a bad thing, but just something to keep in mind and I hope you get where I'm coming from. Regardless, a more seamless blend between the end of the blue eyeshadow into the white(?) cream (?) would fix that and make it seem a bit more \"natural\" (again, as \"natural\" as blue can be haha).\n\nIn regards to your nose contour, that is a bit more difficult. Tbh I'm probably not the best to give CC on it, since I don't contour my nose at all - I can only say that in the past when I've tried to contour with blue, I've always run into the difficulty of making it sharp enough to show that it's there but not too blended out that it makes my skin look sickly/not quite right. It seems to me that you've run into the problem of having it be too harsh, so it looks like you've just taken blue and put the lines down your nose without blending it in. I cannot give you any suggestions on how to frame the tip of your nose in blue other than I think it might look better without it (at least when it comes to blue contour), but on the sides I would suggest trying to take the blue further down the sides of your nose going towards your cheeks (hope this makes sense) - maybe  taking a lighter shade of blue to feather out the edges.\n\nAnyway I'll leave it at that. Again, kudos to trying something new and sharing it!

Reddit is weird about the paragraph spacing it seems.\n\nI have a couple of things to say in regards to your poem and hope you don't take it personal, since I do really enjoy the message of your poem a lot. Feel free to ask for any clarification :)\n\nSo I've noticed that throughout the poem there are some inconsistencies in the meaning/feeling im assuming you want to convey. Firstly with your rhyme scheme, and sometimes with your metaphors. \n\nFor example - I see that you have a rhyme scheme going on for majority of the poem, but sometimes break from it for no reason that I can really see. The 3rd stanza exemplifies this - \"wrong/strong\" is still a rhyme but \"friend/said\" is not (or just a half rhyme), and majority of the stanza does not rhyme either until the last four lines where the reader is hit with four rhymes all at once \"fight/right/night/eyesight\". \n\nI'm saying this because usually, at least from what I know in contemporary poetry, rhyming is used to emphasise the message of a line or a feeling - in your case, it seems like you want to make the rhyme scheme to give the poem some feeling of peace, or the impression of a calm narrator looking back on their experiences with their bat's (you). Which makes total sense and I like that! But my point is that if you want to have that tone, then if you do break your rhyme scheme, it should be to emphasise something - so the 3rd stanza not rhyming makes sense since it describes the discordant and varied contexts through which the bat's are made, but that effect is ruined by the random lines that DO rhyme in the same stanza. \n\nThis is especially so since you do this effectively in the stanza above - \"go/window/show\" gives a great rhythm that builds on one another and then is abruptly stopped by \"hinder\". That gives such a beautiful structural and tonal feeling that reflects the bat's stopping you, it packs a punch in reflecting how they trip you up.\n\nWhich brings me to my second inconsistency in regards to metaphors, although I will say right now that this is perhaps more of a reflection of my own personal preferences - or more of a nit pick I suppose. So if you don't want to take any of this on board that's fine, I'm just saying that perhaps it might be worth keeping in mind for future poems. \n\nSo in the first stanza I'm not sure that saying you have pet bats and then using a simile with gnats to symbolise how they eat at your mind really works. Only because bats already have that kind of symbolism attached to taking things--bloodsucking, thought to be dirty animals that will give you diseases (ie 'taking' your health), vampires etc--that is already incredibly powerful (and which you go into detail explaining how they take your time/mental health), and since bats are found throughout the poem with no other reference to other animals (apart from the dove, which is not a metaphor in regards to how its affecting your mind, but in regards to how the vision you're seeing feels and disappears), the gnats seem out of place when there's no further mention of them. But I also see that it's most likely due to your rhyme scheme so I can understand the difficulty in adjusting the line (the eternal annoyance with rhyming!), but nonetheless to bring in a separate animal to describe the same symbolism makes the poem less self-contained. Perhaps the metaphor could be adjusted to say that they were vampire bats at first (taking blood) and turned into (or turned out to be) fruit bats, which would work fantastic with the imagery of planting trees to give them a home/love/sustenance!\n\nI would also add that using \"and my thoughts is their bread\" is 1) a little long and could be shortened by removing the \"and\" and \"is\" - which I feel would make it more punchy. And 2) I would say examine, or reconsider using this metaphor since in the last stanza you talk about the wise man having the bats on his hand like bread crumbs. I don't really know why, and I think this really is a nit pick, but it doesn't seem to quite fit; you're using bread as a metaphor in the first stanza, and as a simple visual reference for the last (or feeling reference due to the positive association of \"bread in hand=feeding doves/ducks and happiness). Maybe it feels that way to me because the metaphor of the mind being eaten/rotting like bread is very powerful, and then to use it as a way of visualising bat's sitting on a palm is discordant as the intensity of feeling is off.\n\nGoodness I just realised how long this comment has gotten, kinda sorry about that! I hope you don't take it to mean that your poem is not good because of these critiques, because it is since it conveys the feeling/experience well. But at this moment in time, it gives me the feeling of taking a quick breath, when I feel like it has the great potential to be breathtaking.

And, subsequently, what things can I control? And go from there. \n\nSo for you: you can't control that the pandemic is happening, nor what will happen with your government or their decisions (beyond giving your vote of course), nor your friends. Do not focus on your lack of control for things that aren't in your control in the first place - easier said than done, sure I get that, and some days are harder than others to accept that, but nonetheless it will serve you in the long run better when you become aware of it and can really accept it. So then the question emerges:  if I cannot control these things, how can I control my reactions to it, or at least control how much they can influence my emotions/anxiety? \n\nWhat you can control: adhering to the advice of the government to limit the possibility of contracting coronavirus (wash hands, social distancing etc), continue trying getting a job, breathe, help your parents (you can't control their immune system, but you can control making as safe of an environment as possible for them and yourself).\n\nTo continue on from that, if I may be a little harsh even though I'm stranger on the Internet, from your post it seems like a lot of anxiety/extra noise in your brain comes from the \"friends\" in your life. (I'm saying \"friends\" only bc you've described them as acquaintance-ish, friend-ish, so I'm putting it in \"..\" as a shorthand). There's already enough noise/anxiety bc of this pandemic, your \"friends\" shouldn't add to that. Tbh I'm kinda projecting a little rn bc it's an issue I'm going through at the moment, but that doesn't make it any less true: a friend should enhance your life, not make you more stressed/anxious/down after talking to them. \n\nTry talking to them and say to them that your calls with them aren't helping, are you able to talk about things that won't worsen my mental health? And I honestly get that that's hard to ask, but perpetually being on the proverbial edge of the cliff is harder. That's exhausting, and dangerous. If you've tried to tell them that and they can't change (or worse, won't bc they don't want to) then cut them out of your life for now.\n\nNo one is entitled to your time. Or your sympathetic ear. Or anything about you--you are entitled to that first and foremost. You can't control your friends, you can only ask them to adjust, but if they won't then you can control how much you interact with them, if at all.\n\nI'm sorry this turned into a very long comment and I hope that I didn't come across as too harsh. Again, partially projecting here since I'm dealing with difficult friends. But bottom line: examine the things you can't control (and accept that you can't), and which ones you can (mainly how you react to those things). Out of the ones you can control, find a way that puts you in as good/calm of a position as you can.\n\nApart from that, take it one day at a time. Things will work out. The pandemic will end eventually. You will find a job. Your parents are fine as of this moment, and you're doing your part to help. It will be okay. Today is today, and what you can do for today is enough, whatever that may be.\n\nPlease stay safe, not just in relation to the pandemic, but in also in relation to your mental health as well.

To me, this setup seems very curated to what OP needs and is interested in, and that's what minimalism is about ultimately.\n\nSorry to have gone on a tangent, but I for one am so extremely happy to see a minimalist set up that involves colours and anime (two of my favourite things!), since it's so rare to see it within minimalism! This is incredibly aesthetically pleasing to me, and I really like how even with the minimalism OPs personality and interests shine through the details.

I have the original, which has fantastic matte shades with variety - two cool toned browns, two warm toned browns, a black and a dark grey which are a great way to see which tones work best with your skin tone and you can play around with really smoky eye looks. There's 4 matte purples which are some of the best I've ever used, and allow for playing around with matte colours. And all of these pair really nicely with the baked shadows, which you can use as lid-colours or even by themselves! I've been really enjoying just taking a fluffy brush to create the shape of the eye look and then just intensifying the colour on my lid with a finger for a monochromatic colourful look. \n\nIt's 24 eyeshadows with a highlighter in the middle (if you're pale/fair skinned at least - though BH highlighters are fantastic toppers and great inner corner highlights even if you can't use it on the cheeks) for like \u00a320, and often the palette is on sale (I personally got mine at TK Maxx for \u00a310 which was an absolute steal).

I've been using a blue toned highlighter myself), blending it slightly into the inner potion of my eyelid to make it seamless and /voil\u00e0/ eyelook is complete!\n\nAs someone else commented, putting brown in the crease is also really nice. I'd imagine with this particular blue shade a dark green, dark grey or black would also look great with it.\n\nIf I could make another suggestion - put a black base on your eyes (can be done with just a kohl eye pencil/cream/whatever, just has to be slightly tacky and black) , sketching out the shape your want and apply the blue shimmer on top. It can be a very bold look, but really beautiful! I got this trick off of a jackie aina video, but I cannot seem to find it right now - I just remember that it was based on the makeup Pat Mcgrath did for the Versace fashion show, those bold, monochromatic cat eye looks. For a slightly less intense look based off of that, just do a liner like usual (again with the cream/tacky black base mentioned above) and pack some blue shimmer on it for a subtle, but really popping, coloured eyeliner look.\n\nHonestly, I've found just sitting down on a day where you have little to do and trying out a couple of different things is the best way to go imo. I do it pretty much every other day, and it feels like trying on different clothes for outfits - it's so much fun!
