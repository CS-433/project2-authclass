But as a little boy, I had to go to bed at 8 pm sharp and turn off the lights. No exceptions! So there I lay in bed and all I could do was listen to the few cars that passed through or parked on our small road until I fell asleep three or four hours later. Taking a quick peek through the window, I learned quickly, who came home or went away. Petrolhead grandpa had already taught me all the cars and their names, the Fiats, the Renaults, the Fords, the Citro\u00ebns and all the others on our road.\n\nSo I learned to recognise all the cars by their sound, before I even went to Kindergarten. Each car had a very distinct sound and I knew them all. My parents wouldn't believe me for a long time until my uncle was to come to visit us one night. I knew what car he had (forgotten now) and when I heard that car park, I told my mom that they had arrived. She looked out the kitchen window and gave me a very strange look. Now they believed me.\n\nLater the cars became a lot less noisy and I could recognize less and less of them by sound. None of the new ones. But some of the really old ones, I can make them out even today.\n\nWatching the movie \"Brainwashed\" later in life hit me quite hard. I had not learned to play chess, but I had learned something while being \"imprisoned\" at an age of just about out of the diapers and there was no way out.
