The HSK wordlists have been criticized as being too literary...\n\nAuthor of shared answer here. You do bring up some worthwhile points, and if you take a look [at the full answer](https://heavenlypath.notion.site/Comprehensive-Reading-Guide-From-beginner-to-native-novels-b3d6abd583a944a397b4fbbb81e0c38c), you'll see that we included the following comment:\n\n>That being said, following the HSK is better than doing nothing with your learning. There is certainly some overlap, and some learners might find the structured and detailed form of official textbooks very useful\n\nHowever, I still have to agree with huajiaoyu in that following the HSK up to level 6 is not the most efficient nor even enjoyable way to learn Chinese. Here's my take on a few of the points that you brought up:\n\n* *You don't just master 5000 words and that's it.* Correct, even at HSK 5, you have to learn quite a bit outside the syllabus. But that's not necessarily an argument for following the HSK, is it? I'd think it would encourage you to do quite the opposite, as it shows that even if you do try and study for the HSK 6, you'll still have to do 'normal' immersion.\n*  *As our reading and listening improves, we receive an increasing volume of increasingly difficult input. In this way, we encounter the HSK vocabulary.* Of course, there is overlap between HSK and what you encounter. But, by studying words that you come across, the percentage of words you learn useful to you is 100%. On the other hand, you might learn HSK words and never find them to be useful at all during your learning.  \nI've read millions of characters, and just quickly looked over the HSK 6 wordlist. I don't recall ever coming across words such as \u9971\u7ecf\u6ca7\u6851, \u5907\u5fd8\u5f55, or \u56fd\u52a1\u9662 - and don't even understand the English definition of some of them, as a native speaker.\n* *If your goal is to read literature, then \"being too literary\" is not a problem.* Literary words do not map to literature, especially modern Chinese literature. I've seen a big overlap between 20th century literature and the words in HSK 6, but if you're planning on reading webnovels (most likely, given their volume and accessibility), words aren't terribly literary and sound more like normal speech, often interspersed with slang that you won't find in the HSK.\n\nThat being said, to the OP and anyone else reading this comment, don't completely overlook the later HSK levels. I myself do occasionally go through the HSK 6 textbook to more formally learn some grammar points in addition to self-study; BeckyLiBei rightly pointed out that you'll have more resources available that are closely graded to your level if you strictly follow the HSK.\n\nAll in all, once you reach HSK 4 or 5, I would suggest taking a look at the next level up, and seeing whether or not you think it would be *useful* to you given your Chinese-learning goal.", "created_utc": "1646486778.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hzg6hs8", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_t6s9o4", "parent_id": "t1_hzfwogg", "score": "3", "subreddit": "ChineseLanguage", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qyz1"}, {"author": "LAcuber", "body": "If you have a Windows computer or VR gear, the VRchat app is a great platform for this sort of thing.

While strong vocabulary-wise, I'd suggest you augment it with reading materials and other content on the side.\n\nAfterwards, I moved onto the HSK, as I like the structure and grammar notes provided. I went through the HSK 3 and 4 BLCUP textbooks (HC goes \"up to HSK 4\", but this isn't strictly true). I was reading graded readers around this level.\n\nAfter finishing HSK 4, I started taking a look at novels in Chinese - but very simple ones (usually \\~30-60k character range). While at the start it was tough, the repetition and motivation they brought (combined with SRS, I highly recommend you download the app Pleco and even shell out for some add-ons such as the flashcard one or Anki) have been steadily increasing my level. Now I'm going through HSK 5 and reading for study and pleasure to learn.\n\nWhat I'd suggest for you:\n\n* app-wise: HelloChinese, DuChinese (easy reading), Pleco, Anki (if no Pleco flashcards)\n* book-wise: HSK textbooks, Mandarin Companion graded readers, graded readers from Sinolingua if you run out (take a look at [this guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vSjVsapt4NOZx0KuDwgBUfQggTyT15hdgUjHHdqZRnV8LTnzQ5lY-fKjJhV0cb7I06q3x_syq1DyE4H/pub) for more info on reading at lower levels and beyond), Readibu (an app that allows you to read webnovels and generally Chinese texts online)\n* video-wise: you can take a look at Mandarin Corner, but generally I'd just suggest listening to audiobooks/podcasts. A good cartoon for beginners is Peppa Pig in Chinese, for more intermediate learners - \u559c\u7f8a\u7f8a\n* tips:\n   * Don't ignore tones, unless you never plan to speak. Seriously. I did this, and it's been a slog the past couple of months catching up and learning them.\n   * Consider the need for handwriting; a lot of learners, especially at the beginning stages, do practice handwriting. In the digital world, it's not that much of a tool anymore though and takes time away from learning Chinese other ways.\n   * Comprehensible input: as well-intentioned as some learners and comments may be, reading something way above your level really isn't the path to take. Instead, take a look at *I + 1* \\- texts just a bit higher than your level. I may sound like a bit of a hypocrite here with the novels I dived into, but there's actually a number of them that can be quite readable, especially after you've learned keywords after a few chapters.\n   * Have fun! Learning Chinese is supposed to be a joy, not a task (for most learners, sounds like for you as well). If you lose motivation it can quickly become game over. Try to figure out *why* you are learning Chinese, and set yourself small goals you can achieve. If you're unsure about your goals, you can look at [this post series](https://www.hackingchinese.com/goals-and-motivation-part-1-introduction/). And it doesn't have to be anything quantifiable, just something that drives you to learn - even just the simple joy of slowly progressing in a foreign language!\n\nAll the best in your journey!

With the power of CSS, this can be fixed!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Steps**\n\n1. Find the CSS file\n\nWe need to access the CSS file that controls the look of the main window. I built this with Mac and was able to find it by going to *Applications* in the Finder, then right-clicking Anki, clicking *Show Package Contents -> Contents -> Resources -> aqt\\_data -> web -> toolbar-bottom.css.* The process should be similar for Windows/Linux.\n\n*If you're on Windows/Linux please share so others can learn how to access the file as well.*\n\n2. Open the CSS file\n\nNow that we've found our file, we need to actually modify its contents. Open up the file with a text editor (I use VS Code) such as TextEdit, NotePad, Atom, etc... - simply anything that allows you to open and edit the file.\n\nYou should see something like this when you open it for the first time:\n\n    #header {\n        border-bottom: 0;\n        margin-bottom: 12px;\n        margin-top: 0;\n        padding: 9px;\n    }\n\n3. Modify the CSS file\n\nThis is where the magic happens! If you'd like to edit the button, you need to apply CSS rules to it. But be warned! Applying CSS rules as so:\n\n    button {\n        color: yellow;\n    }\n\ndoesn't work! Instead, we need to access the button like this:\n\n    #header > tbody > tr > td > button {\n        color: yellow;\n    }\n\nNow underneath the original code, we can add our own CSS styling to the button in the above format. If you'd like to have the same animated, night-mode optimized buttons as me, you can copy the code from the pastebin [here](https://pastebin.com/TkXYM3qw) and add it below the original code.\n\n*Note: code is not fully mine, I was playing around with some free codepen.io templates online. Shouldn't be a problem for private use.*\n\n4. Save and Reload\n\nMake sure you save the CSS file and then quit Anki. Once you open it up again, you'll have your slick new CSS buttons instead of the boring old ones!", "created_utc": "1602866014.0", "edited": "1602866271.0", "id": "g90lljd", "is_submitter": "True", "link_id": "t3_jccw9x", "parent_id": "t3_jccw9x", "score": "14", "subreddit": "Anki", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s9lm"}, {"author": "LAcuber", "body": "Looks great!

My biggest - and perhaps least specific - goal is to be able to **read.** Chinese literature is incredible, and understandable hundreds and even thousands of years later to due the structure of the language.\n2. Conversation - I would like to be able to speak to a good Chinese friend of mine in Mandarin. Also, it'd be wonderful to go to China and gain insight into the culture and people by speaking their native language.\n3. Calligraphy - Chinese writing has always intrigued me - not only the beauty of it, but also the way that the characters can be added together - almost like a math equation - to form new words (think *\u5fae\u7b11 = micro laugh = smile* or *\u58c1\u864e = wall tiger = gecko*). I love the everything about the characters.\n\nAnother redditor on this thread has been deliberating over whether or not to learn Chinese. I don't want to clutter up this post :P, but I gave some more personal motivations of mine, as well as resources and information about the language and difficulties, on that comment: [https://www.reddit.com/r/languagelearning/comments/ij55rz/what\\_language\\_are\\_you\\_currently\\_learning\\_and/g3d45af?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/languagelearning/comments/ij55rz/what_language_are_you_currently_learning_and/g3d45af?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).\n\n\u6211\u5f88\u559c\u6b22\u5b66\u6c49\u8bed\uff01", "created_utc": "1598802811.0", "edited": "False", "id": "g3d64cg", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_ij55rz", "parent_id": "t3_ij55rz", "score": "1", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "LAcuber", "body": "Jumping on the boat here as another learner of Mandarin who's started on the language a few months ago as well. I spent a couple months learning it last year, but dropped it due to a lot of work I had to get done, but with COVID-19 and all this in May I started to learn the language again.\n\nPersonally, I find that Mandarin Chinese isn't *as* difficult as many say - although the way the language is structured, characters, and pronunciation is alien to those with only knowledge of Indo-European languages, there are plus sides to the language.\n\nFor example, there are no genders - grammar is really easy, many of the characters have 'radicals' which can help you understand their meaning or are visual, and there's a plethora of resources. Pinyin also makes it easy for beginners to properly pronounce.\n\nWhat I'd say is hardest for beginners - and this draws heavily from personal experience - is pronunciation. Seemingly the same word - Romanized and similar sounding, at least - can mean up to 5 meanings - excluding homonyms or multiple meanings. [Case in point - don't call your mother a horse.](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn%3AANd9GcRQCeog1qjz3rRBwGOQljLZEtim2vjh9z8WCg&usqp=CAU) As well as that, pinyin can become a crutch, making it harder to identify and read already (sometimes) [difficult to understand characters](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/41/Bi%C3%A1ng.svg/1024px-Bi%C3%A1ng.svg.png).\n\nStill, since I've started learning, I haven't looked back - I love the language more and more each day. Excluding the practical reasons to learn it (#1 most spoken language, China is a growing economic powerhouse, connect with a vastly different culture/literature/religion) there are fascinating aspects to the language. Below are just a couple of reasons:\n\n1. Character composition - characters for tree + bag + bear = koala, as an example. Instead of having unique words for everything like English, Chinese has thousands of characters that can combine to bring new meaning. I love how these can be added together to create interesting (often [hilarious](https://i.redd.it/ysnnh26ulxf31.jpg)) meanings.\n2. Chinese history - China, in one form or another, has existed for thousands of years. Because of the pictogram-esque nature of its characters, if you learn Traditional, or learn a few more characters, you can read text hundreds or even [thousands years old](https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/a/18535).\n3. Figurative New World - China and much of Asia developed completely differently to Europe and the rest of the world. Their literature, art, and religion is different from that of the Western World. You can connect to this by learning Chinese.\n\nIn summary, **yes. Learn Mandarin Chinese.**\n\n**\\*Edit\\* (resources):** There are a lot of resources out there, and can become easy to get overwhelmed and go down the wrong path. Some recommendations:\n\n* HelloChinese - *much* better than Duolingo, focused on only Chinese with native speakers. Free.\n* Pleco - dictionary app, one of the best in the world and possibly *the* best for Chinese. Nothing like it for Japanese or Korean.\n* Paper & pen - **write!** You'll help yourself learning characters so much more easily. Practice on square paper - or even better, *mi zi ge* (rice paper) with a good Chinese font (try KaiTi).\n* r/ChineseLanguage \\- check out the wiki for more resources and the main page for a community of fellow Chinese language-learning enthusiasts!", "created_utc": "1598801870.0", "edited": "1598802109.0", "id": "g3d45af", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_ij55rz", "parent_id": "t1_g3ca0qe", "score": "3", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "LAcuber", "body": "It's great of you to do this!
