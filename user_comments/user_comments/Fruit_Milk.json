We've both used healthcare connect since we've been here 2 years ago, and we've called them multiple times and just end up on hold for hours before they hang up. They've actually assigned us to multiple doctors that when we call, they aren't even taking patients lol. We've manually called doctors ourselves going down lists but everyone is full. We've even moved to different and less populous areas and the doctor availability situation is horrible all around no matter what. Unless you go to a rural area, it seems extremely scarce.\n\nMy partner also hasn't been able to find a family doctor and has had the same negative experiences with doctors, maybe even worse (they were in the ER two days in a row for something they should have been treated immediately the first day. When another doctor down the line saw them, they were upset because of the negligence shown and timeliness of treating; go figure). Similar experiences to me. We've seen people in the ER walk out with bleeding limbs because they've been waiting hours and hours and haven't been seen. I was in the ER for almost a whole day just waiting for an x-ray. And there's countless stories of ERs straight up just closing because they can't see anyone else. People have had to drive hours and hours to the next ER. My partner is a Canadian native and the experience is the same in Vancouver as well. \n\nAnd honestly, I'd rather have more tests done than none at all. I've never had negative experiences in the US, and I've moved like every year or two to different states across the US. I shouldn't be refused simple tests or not even given them at all. For example, if I have all the symptoms of strep, why shouldn't I just be tested for strep? I get not wanting to do invasive tests, especially if the patient doesn't want it. But it's not that, and if the patient is having symptoms for a long time with no improvement, and desperately wants an answer, I don't see the point in denying a test; especially when a majority are not something that hurts you, and the alternative is not being treated at all. As well as if everything else has been explored already and the patient asks for it.\n\nDoctors in the US get paid more and have an incentive to dig in; doctors in Canada have no incentive and actually have MORE of an incentive to rush people through because they only get paid enough when they see a patient every 5 minutes lol. Of course the care is going to be worse and they're going to rush someone out. I don't care if it's driven by greed if I'm getting better and more often quality of care. Walk-ins in the US didn't have this horrible of an experience, I don't think it's a walk-in thing either. I was never rushed out 5 mins into an appointment and saw big signs everywhere that say \"one issue per appointment\". \n\nAlso, the ADHD thing happened more than a year after not having a family doctor already and having issues with the system, so it's 100% not something in my file. I also had already been prescribed the same medication even from the same clinic, and had sent in my diagnosis prior. I think I just got a shitty doctor (he literally asked if my meds were for \"depression or something\" and seemed clueless about ADHD. The reason I brought it up was because in comparison, the paid services I use are significantly higher in quality and frequency of care compared to the standard here. The fact that I could just pay $30 a month and bypass the hassle of all of that for significantly better care and constant, confirmed appointments. It works with anything else I can be seen online for as well; I can be seen the same day for an appointment, and I'm thoroughly taken care of with follow-ups and professional care. \n\nMy experience with the two-tiered healthcare system in the US has been nothing but great, and I've had experience with both spectrums (free government healthcare and insured through employer). The quality of care wasn't different in any way, I was seen mostly immediately, and I didn't have a fear about going to the doctor and not being able to get taken care of for months. It's so nice to just get things out of the way and not have issues linger, and it shouldn't be the norm here. \n\nI think people in Canada are too caught up in trying to one-up the US to admit it's not working, but honestly unless something changes, doctors will continue to leave for the US and things will only get worse. I'm honestly excited I'm starting to see it crumble, because that means something will change. Maybe we can come back in the future, because honestly everything else about Canada is really nice. It's just too big of an impact on life to stay.", "created_utc": "1666277384.0", "edited": "False", "id": "it2r7dp", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_y8dqnz", "parent_id": "t1_it1zp5h", "score": "1", "subreddit": "askTO", "subreddit_id": "t5_2xjsd"}, {"author": "Fruit_Milk", "body": "Because as an American, now a resident in Canada; healthcare here is absolute dogwater and one of the main reasons I want to move back to the US.\n\nI've never had to wait for appointments in the US, maybe 2 weeks max for some referral appointment and that was pretty rare. Walk-in and get seen within 15 mins, doctors were very willing to test me for things and explore what's wrong. \n\nMy health has SIGNIFICANTLY declined since I've been here; I'm only in my early 20s. Medical issue after medical issue piling up because appointments have long wait times and I can't be seen anyway. I've been living here for 2 years and still don't have a family doctor. Wait times for a simple allergy test are at the one year mark. Tests can take months to even get an appointment. I'm still waiting for places to even call me back for tests, half of them don't even pick up.\n\nMy partner's mother was having symptoms and was refused testing until availability opened up like a year later. She flew out of country, got seen, tested, diagnosed, and treated within 3 days. She had CANCER. If she had waited in Canada...she wouldn't be here. In fact, waiting in Canada 100% made things worse. \n\nI have diagnosed ADHD and need medication to function in my day-to-day. I was refused a refill by a walk-in clinic, and was told I need my family doctor to give it to me. I don't have one. They reluctantly said they'd refer me to a psych and hung up immediately. That was almost a year ago and I still haven't heard a single thing back lol. I was without meds for so long. But I found a website that you pay $30 a month for, and can talk to a doctor, nurses, etc that manage your care. I'm able to get my meds every month, have follow-ups scheduled, no issues, care is amazing. Any other care I can get virtually, I use a similar service my employer pays for with telemedicine. Amazing experiences. Starting to see a pattern with paid experiences and Canada's experiences.\n\nI'm worried my and my family's health is going to be permanently impacted because we have to wait so long for everything. Extremely dismissive doctors, sub-par care, rushing out the door within 2 minutes of an appointment. \n\nI would CERTAINLY pay to get seen. I just want the option. And in Canada, right now the option is just wait and let your health deteriorate.\n \nMy experience with public healthcare has been nothing but negative. I'm tired of being in pain or sick all the time for things that should be extremely easy to diagnose and treat if I could just GET SEEN and taken care of. \n\nThe one thing this healthcare system is good for is if you have cancer and are getting treated, then your wallet is safe. Probably it. Otherwise, if you have anything chronic, or honestly anything else, and especially if you don't have a family doctor, good luck. Preventative care doesn't exist, and you're barely treated until it's absolutely fatal, then they'll MAYBE rush you into treatment when it's late.\n\nRight now it feels like the system just makes for a shitty experience for all.", "created_utc": "1666247879.0", "edited": "False", "id": "it1gnll", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_y8dqnz", "parent_id": "t1_it0tpff", "score": "2", "subreddit": "askTO", "subreddit_id": "t5_2xjsd"}, {"author": "Fruit_Milk", "body": "Thought this was r/outside lol", "created_utc": "1666245960.0", "edited": "False", "id": "it1e7ir", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_y8n7rv", "parent_id": "t3_y8n7rv", "score": "1", "subreddit": "Showerthoughts", "subreddit_id": "t5_2szyo"}, {"author": "Fruit_Milk", "body": "People are just haters, he climbed his way to the top", "created_utc": "1666022023.0", "edited": "False", "id": "isoq8pc", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_y6az9t", "parent_id": "t3_y6az9t", "score": "24", "subreddit": "dalle2", "subreddit_id": "t5_66jnlu"}, {"author": "Fruit_Milk", "body": "Everything.

I also think it would help the whole bike become more cohesive overall, since the other shapes are also basic shapes without much detail.\n\nAs for the background, I agree with the other comments about the trees and everything being too detailed. I think a good middleground could be removing the extra detail (like you already have with the rest of the bike) and making the trees just a solid block of color. You could keep the mountain shadows at the top, I think that still fits in pretty well.\n\nLastly, I like the texture you have on the type, but I'm not sure it fits in with the logo since that's the only place you see it (the type and picture could feel a little disjointed). I think the acronym is too long; no one can pronounce it, and I'm not sure people would say the letters either. I'm sure for the demographic it's not a problem of recognizing what it stands for, but more of practicality; at the end of the day, I think they're still going to just say \"oh, I really like St. Louis Mountain Biking\" rather than saying \"I like S-T-L-M--T-B\".

I think having the \"bright beauty\" by itself as a logotype would be very effective; you still have enough of that heart in the b (and a lovely shape for the letterform itself) to be strong by itself.\n\nNot sure about the typeface for \"beauty\" under it, the y feels a little off.
