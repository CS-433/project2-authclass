[{"author": "9th_Planet_Pluto", "body": "the other guy already answered the difference between languages, so I'll talk about my thoughts on which to choose: \n\nNorwegian is pretty easy if you know German. I tried Norwegian for a few months and it was nice. Just didn't have time for it while studying German. I did it because it sounds really cute, but there just wasn't much to do with Norwegian so was hard to keep interest. German has 10x the population of any of the langs you asked about and thus a lot of content to consume, whereas I assume most Norwegians/Nordics just consume online content in English, even produce a lot of it in English (and I mainly care about internet stuff). Japan has even more online content than German because they suck at English and have a huge domestic market\n\nFinnish would be a cool challenge since they're very different from any european lang (besides hungarian). But suffers the same problem with lack of content I'm interested in due to a small population.\n\nYou might also consider not doing a new one right now.

From what I saw, JP->KR and EN->KR have the same layout, except that JP only has parts 1-3, whereas EN has all 7. The courses are so terribly structured.\n\nMemrise courses have been great for European langs. I never completed any of them, but got a decent way through Russian and Norwegian. Were always great to get the first few hundred basic vocab and some useful phrases. Currently doing DE->ES and it's amazing for a beginner. For the European langs it seems they have a formula and same set of vocab they teach in the same order, and it works! (can't tell you how many times I've seen \"You are a genius!\" in the first part of memrise courses lol)\n\nBut by god the Korean one is so terrible. So many hyper-specific phrases and random tourist or kpop sentences in part 1. Neither of which I care for, but fine, there's probably lots of people learning Korean for that purpose. But those people who are new to language learning would probably quit this course out of frustration and get the wrong impression on how hard it is. \n\nI just want to learn colors, days of the week, objects in nature, basic vocab. Stuff that's not touched on till way later parts. \ud83d\ude29\n\nI thought about just setting \"ignore\" on all the niche sentences and terms memrise gives me, so I can just get the vocab I'll actually use as a beginner.

You're not appealing to the masses, you're appealing to others who partake in your niche.

Maybe it was *only* if the flashcards don't have context. But he doesn't seem to use them at all, preferring just input all the time. \n\nI think it's a personal difference, but for me starting a new language, I'll do a few hundred vocab words on memrise without any context, I can just remember them. I don't need context for basic objects and concepts like vegetable, car, mad, good. If a word gives me trouble, I might spend a few minutes really learning it, or make up a story (memorization technique) for it. Only more abstract or nuanced words like \"melancholy\", \"engage\", \"interpret\" I'd need context for.\n\nAfter I know a basic few hundred or a thousand, I'd start mining native material using flashcards, the word with the context sentence. Even though I too only have an hour or two a day, I probably spend half that time creating or reviewing flashcards.

Most people specialize in one lane, and in a few champs. You can buy the other champs over time. But if you want to play every lane and random champs all the time, I guess it sucks yeah.\n\n4) don't play only AI till lvl 30. That sounds monotonous and torturous. Either play with friends or grow a thick skin (or mute all). Toxicity personally doesn't affect me since I can ignore it.\n\n5) don't play if its not fun. maybe take a break and try again later. but why torture yourself if you're not having fun.\n\nI would never play Dota or HOTS, mainly because LoL is the game I love and have played for almost a decade.

Many African countries were set up with weak institutions and infrastructure designed to extract wealth, rather than develop local growth and stability. Outside forces continued meddling through cold war politics. Even today you have corporations, the Chinese government, and French government (among others) seeking to establish influence.\n\nSure, in the end you still have corrupt politicians, a giant territory, and tons of different ethnic groups who all have different interests. It's not *purely* the colonizers fault, but they did do a ton of damage that is \"forgotten\" or \"erased\" today. But these days you've got people arguing it was even a net positive that they were colonized, justifying it.\n\nMy problem was mainly with the way it's phrased, \"x did actually quite a lot\", \"sure, there was a strict X but it was better than Y\".
