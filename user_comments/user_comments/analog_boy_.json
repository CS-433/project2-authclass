T is not a miracle gender-dysphoria solution; it's a hormone that's going to make you look more like a man. Which for me made all the possible negatives worth it, but it might not for you.\n\nMuscle growth is something that can be achieved without hormones, even though T does help a little (I personally haven't noticed that much muscle growth although with quarantine I also haven't really been working out). Honestly I would look at your dad/brothers/other male relatives and realize that's what you will look like (obviously not right away, but eventually). If that is appealing (or at least the positives outweigh the negatives) then T would help. If not, then it won't. Realistic transition goals are difficult to have especially bc it involves separating dysphoria from general dysmorphia (like T will definitely make my voice deeper, but it's not going to make me taller or give me a 6-pack), and I think it would be a really good idea to talk to a therapist about that and see if you can get a better picture of what is possible for you.\n\nHowever, going off T doesn't really have any serious health concerns that aren't dysphoria-related, so if you start it and something starts happening that you don't like, you can always stop. Just remember that if you get body/facial hair for example and you don't like it, it's not reversible, stopping will just prevent it from growing more.\n\nOverall it sounds like you have generally the same concerns I did/still do, and ultimately it's up to you if you think it will help. (also I hear you on the endocrinologist, a lot of doctors, even ones who prescribe hormones, still don't really understand a lot of trans stuff unless it's just \"I want to be a binary man please give me all the T you have\" which is valid just not for everyone)", "created_utc": "1594073718.0", "edited": "False", "id": "fx58b2s", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_hlx5dn", "parent_id": "t1_fx54dsb", "score": "1", "subreddit": "NonBinary", "subreddit_id": "t5_2vcez"}, {"author": "analog_boy_", "body": "That's sounds like a good plan for what you want! I would only caution one more thing that I'm sure you already know, and that's that most of the \"masculinization\" effects that aren't body hair/voice/bottom growth, so basically the muscle/fat redistribution, would revert once you stop taking T.
