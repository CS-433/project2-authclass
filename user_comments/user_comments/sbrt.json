Also, products change their ingredients - last week it was GF, this week it is not. Yikes!\n3. If you share a kitchen with gluten, you will need to be extremely careful. Gluten on sponges, gluten on counters, gluten on pans, gluten on cutting boards, etc.\n4. A study found that different celiacs have different gluten thresholds. Some can eat food with 100ppm and feel fine. Others react to foods containing as low as 5ppm. Those who are super sensitive usually need to avoid almost all processed foods.\n5. Some of us feel bad when we eat oats, even GF certified oats. Oats make me feel bad.\n6. Some of us feel bad when we eat dairy. Some people recommend avoiding dairy for the first six months as a trial. I feel a little off when I eat dairy so I usually avoid it.\n7. Some restaurants are really careful and it's usually ok but most are not very safe. Eating out is stressful for me which makes it less attractive. I eat out only very rarely.\n8. If you haven't already, you may want to check your vitamin levels. I had low D, B12, and zinc. Supplements have helped.\n9. If you have celiac, you are at higher risk for other autoimmune diseases. I also have an autoimmune kidney disease. Not fun.\n10. When a big group is going out to eat, I just get a drink. It felt weird to do that but it works for me.\n11. At family gatherings, I bring my own food and serve myself before others. That works fine.\n12.

At some point you can start reading simple books with the help of a dictionary. Eventually you can consume other Norwegian media, whatever you like.

However, there are some SBCs that are worth doing.\n\nSome strategies:\n1. Choose SBCs with the highest return on your investment. The intro SBCs are great value. Hybrid Leagues, Hybrid Nations, etc. See futbin (https://www.futbin.com/squad-building-challenges) for predicted cost to do a challenge and compare to market value for the rewards. Lots of people have put together charts of SBC cost/reward like this: https://www.reddit.com/r/FIFA/comments/5yu3im/league_sbc_updated_value_analysis/\n\n2. Take the time to get good prices on players. The lowest buy it now prices is usually 10-20% higher than the lowest bid price - bid low and wait until you get lucky.\n\n3. Open the packs when there are good players in the market. TOTS was a great time to do this. TOTY is good too. If you are going to open a pack when the only special cards are TOTW cards, open it shortly after the TOTW comes out - this is when the TOTW cards have the best resale value.\n\n4. Sell rewards when the market is high. If you can afford to, sell the players you packed when they are in high demand. This can yield great returns.\n\n5. Some packs are bad value. Do some research and avoid these packs. The 84+ team packs are obscenely expensive. Compare what you get with these packs to what you can buy on the open market. Assume that you are probably going to get one of the cards you least want. If it is not tradeable, you will be stuck with a card you can't use.", "created_utc": "1500129705.0", "edited": "False", "id": "dk97831", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_6nbi5e", "parent_id": "t3_6nbi5e", "score": "1", "subreddit": "fut", "subreddit_id": "t5_2swlz"}, {"author": "sbrt", "body": "What a beautiful place to fly.
