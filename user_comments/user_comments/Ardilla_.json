Why? Because the previous MP, Natascha Engel, was passionately pro-fracking, despite the Labour party as a whole being opposed to it. She wrote an open letter in local media defending fracking and asking for constituents to support it. When she lost her seat in the 2017 election, she immediately went to go and work for Ineos as a consultant, and later became the government's fracking Tsar. And Lee Rowley campaigned as being anti-fracking, despite his party's support for the idea.\n\nIt's hard to understate how toxic this issue is for Lee Rowley, and yet he's currently fighting for his life on social media defending having voted with the government last night. \n\nSimilarly, I understand that Alex Stafford was elected as the MP for Rother Valley in 2019 - a safe labour seat since the constituency's creation in ***1918*** -  on the basis of opposing fracking not just in his constituency, but *in the village he lives in.* \n\nHe's not just betrayed his constituents, but his **neighbours**. In a small village of ~1800 people.\n\nI feel like both MPs would have been better off taking a stand, risking having the whip removed, and standing as independents at the next general election if need be, with the line that they stood up for their constituents even when it cost them the whip.

The main alternatives to leather are:\n\na) made from oil-based plastic\n\nb) a bit shit\n\nc) shed microplastics into the environment\n\nd) don't biodegrade\n\nI've owned \"vegan leather\" jackets, belts, and boots in the past. None of them lasted more than 5 years before they started flaking plastic everywhere, and then I had to throw them away.

It's a by-product of the meat industry that prevents animal skins from going to waste.\n\nAnd wool is actually a really sustainable fibre if you source it well.\n\nFor instance, I live in the UK. Around 60% of farmland here isn't suitable for crop production other than grass, meaning that grazing animals is the only way to produce food there. And via regenerative farming practices, pasture land can contribute to both biodiversity and carbon sequestration in the soil.\n\nWool is a great insulating fibre, doesn't shed microplastics, is easily recyclable, and naturally fits into a circular economy because it can be sequestered as soil organic carbon fertiliser at the end of its useful life. Wool doesn't require anywhere near as much water to produce as cotton, and woollen garments require far less washing than many other fibre types.\n\nAnd like leather, wool is a by-product that prevents waste. Shearing sheep isn't done for profit, but for animal welfare. It prevents flystrike and heat-stress in the summer. It actually costs most farmers more to pay someone to shear a sheep than its fleece will sell for these days.\n\nIn the last few years I've been trying really hard to buy less clothing, buy second hand where possible with quality and longevity in mind, and to stick mainly to natural and sustainably produced fibres.

Instead he pivoted hard towards a constitutional monarchy and democracy, helping steer the country through an exceptionally risky transition period that could have erupted into another civil war. \n\nDuring a military coup attempt in the early 1980s, he made a speech on television calling for everyone to support the democratically elected government, which undermined the ringleaders' claims to be acting in the king's name.\n\nEven as recently as 2005, his approval ratings were around 78%.\n\nIn 2012 things started to slip for him, when he had an elephant hunting scandal during Spain's financial crisis. The trip cost something like \u20ac44k (twice the average national salary) and only came to light when he injured himself and had to be flown back. Supposedly no public money was spent, but people were still angry.\n\nShortly afterwards there was also some kind of embezzlement scandal involving his daughter, Infanta Cristina, and her husband.\n\nIn 2014 Juan Carlos announced he would abdicate, ostensibly due to him being old and wanting to pass the throne to a new, younger generation like the former Dutch Queen and Belgian King had recently done, but most likely because of his declining popularity.\n\nThe abdication boosted support for the monarchy to 56%, up from just 50% six months previously. The new king, Felipe, wasn't really considered tarnished by the previous scandals.\n\nThe case against Infanta Cristina and her husband churned along in the background. In 2015 she was stripped of her dukedom while waiting to stand trial. In 2017 she was acquitted, but her husband was found guilty and sentenced to prison for 6 years.\n\nIn 2018 a recording was leaked to the press of the king's \"\"close friend\"\" (\\*cough\\* mistress \\*cough\\*) calling the police about threats and intimidation to engage in money laundering. Juan Carlos had put multiple overseas properties in her name without her knowledge to take advantage of her Monaco residency, and was asking for them back. She claimed that he also held Swiss bank accounts in the name of his cousin, and had received kickbacks from the Saudis in exchange for commercial contracts.\n\nIn March 2020 (*hello small republicanism peak!*), Swiss authorities started investigating a $100 million gift Juan Carlos had sent his mistress for links to Saudi corruption. The new king, Felipe, was found to be an additional beneficiary of a charity that had received a large donation from the Saudi king, and quickly renounced any inheritance from his father and cancelled Juan Carlos's public stipend.\n\nIn June 2020, the Supreme Court of Spain (the only court that can prosecute a former king) announced it would investigate the role of the king in a project to build a high-speed railway between Mecca and Medina for anything of any criminal relevance. The large surge in republican support in July 2020 is likely linked to this being an ongoing news story.\n\nThen, in August 2020 (the height of republican sentiment on that graph), King Juan Carlos ***fucking legged it***.\n\nStraight up left a note saying he was leaving, and by the time his office released it he'd buggered off in a private jet and nobody knew where he was going. Some people thought perhaps the Dominican Republic, but he later turned up in Abu Dhabi and he's lived there ever since.\n\nThe recent uptick in republican support is likely because Swiss prosecutors dropped their investigations in December 2021, and Spanish prosecutors dropped their investigations in March 2022.\n\nThere was some discussion in the Spanish press this week about the awkwardness of the two kings meeting again at the Queen's funeral, and their foreign minister was at pains to point out that he and the king and queen were there representing Spain, while Juan Carlos and his wife Sofia had been invited in a personal capacity.\n\n---\n\nSo yeah, the **TL;DR** of all that is that I expect the evolution of republican vs monarchist sentiment in Spain will depend on how well Felipe can distance himself from his father going forwards, and whether he himself keeps his nose clean.", "created_utc": "1663724584.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ip9x2sw", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_xizypt", "parent_id": "t1_ip7c06m", "score": "2", "subreddit": "ukpolitics", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhcv"}, {"author": "Ardilla_", "body": "I was once caught out by that in Edinburgh", "created_utc": "1663329705.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ionkuxp", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_xflu6q", "parent_id": "t1_ionbzqn", "score": "11", "subreddit": "AskUK", "subreddit_id": "t5_2t4s3"}, {"author": "Ardilla_", "body": "My partner and his friends once tried to prank a small festival, and accidentally provided a useful infrastructure service.\n\nThey made a hand sanitiser podium that had a random chance of blowing an airhorn at you when you used it.

(I can see how that's a very different equation for you and your partner)\n\nBut condoms do come with their downsides. Personally it bugs me that once we've started penetrative sex we can't easily switch back to oral because the condom's internal lube transfers to his penis and I hate the taste and feeling of it. And we occasionally have issues with me getting too wet or not wet enough, causing lack of sensation or chafing, which we suspect wouldn't happen so much without a condom.\n\n(We don't normally find that he struggles to keep an erection wearing one unless I'm excessively wet and we lose all friction. That might just be your partner not being used to them, or he might be wearing a poorly fitting size)\n\nI considered the progestogen pill, but my partner would be uncomfortable trusting me to remember to take a pill at the same time every day and would still want to use condoms as a backup, which to me would defeat the entire point.\n\nI've also been intermittently considering the implant and the hormonal IUD. From what I've read it sounds like the IUD comes with fewer side effects than the implant, because the hormones are released right where they need to be so the dose can be much lower and still have the same effect. But the way our anatomy fits together means his penis can reach my cervix, and I don't want to go through the pain of IUD insertion only to discover that the strings poke him in the glans and make sex *less* enjoyable rather than more so!\n\nSo I've been caught in that indecision of \"Well, our sex life is good right now. Maybe it could be even better. But one option could make me feel crappy all the time due to hormonal side effects, and the other could cause sex to be uncomfortable for my partner.\" and so far it's resulted in continuing to just use condoms. \ud83d\ude43\n\nMy thoughts on your situation, in no particular order, are:\n\n* If you're currently on the pill, absolutely don't want children, and live in a place where abortion access is restricted, I see why you want a backup method of birth control. I don't necessarily think you're being over-anxious there, I know people who've got pregnant on the pill.\n\n* Personally, I wouldn't trust the pull out method. Trying not to orgasm when you're really close is a *gamble* at the best of times, let alone when the people involved are people who have already made an unwise choice to prioritise pleasure over safety. Like... you're selecting for bad outcomes there.\n\n* The IUD or the implant could both be really good options for you, but it sounds like you have similar hang-ups about them to me.\n\n* I don't think I've heard of IUDs ruining the pleasure people get from their cervix, necessarily? So I don't really have any advice on that front. I also get most of my pleasure from internal stimulation during sex, but I think (at least in my case) it's more localised to the walls and the fornices than the cervix. I just find hitting the cervix kind of intense and overwhelming in a way that isn't necessarily pleasant or unpleasant.\n\n* How would you feel about using a less effective birth control method as a backup? Such as a [contraceptive diaphragm with spermicide](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/contraception/contraceptive-diaphragm-or-cap/)? Alone, the contraceptive diaphragm is around 92-96% effective when used with spermicide gel, but if you're on the pill as well the combination should be well over 99% effective.\n\n* If you and your partner have only had sex twice before and he's only had trouble staying hard one of those times, it might well just have been stress. Or you guys might just need more time to feel comfortable around each other in that way. Or he might just need more practice with condoms. I wouldn't necessarily write them off after having one sub-par experience! It's completely possible to have a good sex life in a long term relationship while using condoms, if they do turn out to be the best option for you. :)", "created_utc": "1661980015.0", "edited": "False", "id": "imkoph4", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_x19toc", "parent_id": "t1_imj8lua", "score": "1", "subreddit": "TheGirlSurvivalGuide", "subreddit_id": "t5_2vfzu"}, {"author": "Ardilla_", "body": "If you're in a committed relationship, you've both been STI tested since the start of the relationship, and you trust him not to cheat, by all means make an educated decision on which birth control options are right for you.

So then that would be a GPA, not a percentage. So . . . see, I really still don't understand how your system works.\n\nWhen you graduate an honours degree, you get a degree classification. First class honours, second class honours, or third class honours. Second class is split into upper second class and lower second class. (...don't ask, there is no logic, just tradition)\n\nThat's your grade. You might put it on your CV as \"BSc(hons) in Biology, 2:1\" or \"BA(hons) in History, 1st class\".\n\nGenerally a \"good degree\" is considered to be a 1st or a 2:1.\n\nYour final degree classification is calculated from your exam and coursework grades that you get in the various modules you take. Sometimes they just average all your module grades, but most often they'll weight your grades so that your third year modules count more heavily than your second year modules.\n\nWe don't use letter grades at university. You get percentages back for your exam grades and your coursework assignments. You might say that you got a first, a 2:1, a 2:2, or a third on an assignment colloquially, to convey the banding your mark was in, in the same way Americans would say \"I got a B\".\n\n> Also, are master's degrees in the UK a part of this \"1st/2nd/3rd class\" system? Are master's degrees a part of the whole \"percentage as a final cumulative 'grade'\" system?? I hope I can have an actual GPA for my master's degree in the UK (not a percentage)\n\nLol. Masters degrees operate on a different system entirely: pass, merit and distinction.\n\nPass: 50-59%\n\nMerit: 60-69%\n\nDistinction: 70%+\n\nWe don't use GPAs here at all. And as much as the top mark you can technically get in assignments is 100, the norm tends to be for 80 to be the top \"normal\" mark, and for 81-100 to be reserved for truly exceptional work. \n\nSo you probably want to see if you can find a table of equivalent US GPAs to UK grades, when you're putting together a resum\u00e9, rather than trying to directly convert the percentages. They seem pretty easy to find online.\n\nA good Distinction (~75%) would be **very** impressive here, but I'm guessing a GPA of 2.0 wouldn't carry the same cach\u00e9 across the pond. \ud83d\ude43 I'd assume you'd want to say \"I passed my Masters with Distinction (equivalent to 4.0 GPA in the US)\", rather than sharing the raw percentage.\n\n----\n\nAlso, on the subject of your initial comment getting downvoted... downvotes are for unhelpful or irrelevant comments.

Nobody delays an abortion dithering over whether or not they want to be pregnant, or because they haven't been arsed to get around to making an appointment. \n\n* Some women don't realise that they're pregnant at first due to irregular periods, spotting during their early pregnancy, or not normally having a period due to their hormonal contraception.\n\n* Even for women with regular periods, you aren't typically going to seriously wonder if you're pregnant until your period is significantly late. My cycles are almost always 27-29 days long, but I have had one random 38 day cycle before. I think I went and bought pregnancy tests at the 35-36 day mark?\n\n* Despite the fact the NHS says [you shouldn't have to wait longer than two weeks](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/abortion/) for an abortion, some women under some CCGs are forced to wait much longer. The author of [this article](https://graziadaily.co.uk/life/real-life/abortion-waiting-times-exclusive-investigation/) realised she was pregnant at six weeks, and then had to wait 40 days between her first contact with abortion services and her appointment.\n\n* Some women are in abusive relationships or living situations and may have to evade their partner's or their parents' control to get to an appointment.\n\nCan we please not spread the idea that women go around having later-term abortions on a \"ridiculous\" whim?", "created_utc": "1656443589.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ie3b9j2", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_vmodgq", "parent_id": "t1_ie26ktr", "score": "8", "subreddit": "ukpolitics", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhcv"}, {"author": "Ardilla_", "body": "I'm British so I'm probably missing something important here about how the US political system works, but I keep seeing this online and I'm confused.\n\nIf abortion rights had been codified into federal law by the Democrats at some point in the past, couldn't Trump have repealed said law sometime between 2016 and 2018 when the Republicans held the house, the senate, and the presidency?", "created_utc": "1656337239.0", "edited": "False", "id": "idxf6da", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_vle99e", "parent_id": "t1_idx51w1", "score": "7", "subreddit": "TwoXPreppers", "subreddit_id": "t5_5wnt5j"}, {"author": "Ardilla_", "body": "> I don't think the analogy works. Abortion of a viable foetus is a positive act, not an omission like refusal to donate a kidney. Acts and omissions are viewed differently both legally and morally.\n\nI get where you're coming from, but it seems like splitting hairs to me. Either way the transplant patient/foetus ends up dead, and they would have lived if you'd chosen to give up your body for them or if you'd been forced to give up your bodily autonomy by the government.\n\nHumour me for a second. Imagine you went into hospital for a surgery, and you wake up to the doctors telling you that while they had you on the table they realised you were the only possible kidney match for another patient they had, so they performed the transplant then and there. They say it's possible to reverse the transplant with no damage to the kidney (in this hypothetical), but you'd kill the other person.\n\nIf you wanted to take your kidney back that would be a positive act, not an omission. If the government intervened to stop you getting the transplant reversed, would that not be an infringement of your right to your own body? And wouldn't it be one of the most invasive interventions they could make?\n\n> > The question of when life or personhood begins is completely irrelevant.\n\n> It does in this situation because it is what determines whether the anti-abortion libertarian's positions are consistent or not, which was the issue I was discussing. That the position is fucked up is something I totally agree with, but it's a different matter.\n\nI'm a little confused by this part of your comment.\n\nI get that if one person is arguing that abortion is fine because *it's just a ball of cells/a foetus/it's not yet alive/ it's not a person* [delete as appropriate], and an anti-abortion libertarian believes that life begins before birth and that a foetus **is** alive/a person, it's not inconsistent for them to have come to the conclusion that killing a foetus is murder and that the government should intervene to prevent murder.\n\nWhat I'm saying is that the premise is flawed. That no matter how early you start defining personhood or life \u2014 even if you took it to an absurd extreme and said that a sperm is a living person, or that an egg is a living person \u2014 each individual person's right to inhabit their own body without it being invasively exploited by others supersedes the desire or need of other people to exploit their body to keep themselves alive.

I'm 27 now.\n\nI had no real romantic history through my late teens and early twenties. I never wanted to settle for a relationship that didn't make me as happy as I was single.\n\nBut as the midpoint of my twenties crept closer, it started to worry me that I was getting older and wasn't finding anyone. I had friends and family who'd been dating their long-term partner since they were 18-21, and I was starting to worry that if I didn't find someone in the next few years, would I even be in a position to get married and have kids around the age of 30? I'm smart, I'm educated, I've always planned to have a career that supports me and fulfils me... but I've always wanted a family too.\n\n...and then, all of a sudden, a good friend and I hit it off out of nowhere. Two and a half years later, aged 27 & 31, we're seriously talking about building a future together. (Although we don't plan to get engaged or anything for a couple more years given that I'm currently a grad student)\n\nBut the thing is, I wasn't doing anything differently *then* to what I'd been doing the previous seven years of my adult life. I was just as sociable and confident when I was chronically single as I was when my now-partner and I realised we were interested in each other. And it's not like I've lowered my standards either; he's a wonderful man who I'm deeply in love with, and who checks all my boxes as a partner. The truth of the matter is that **I just got lucky.**\n\nOf course, that makes it very difficult to give advice to friends (and strangers on reddit) suffering from the same anxieties.\ud83d\ude43\n\nThere's this tendency of happily partnered people to give platitudes about how you'll find someone eventually, there's plenty of fish in the sea, and that it's better to focus on enjoying single life until you find someone when you least expect it. **And that's definitely good advice, don't get me wrong.** But \"*hey, it'll all work out, don't worry about it!*\" doesn't address the deep inequities in western society that marginalise single adults (i.e. the expense, never being someone's first priority, the discomfort of not meeting societal expectations, etc), the frustration and heartache they can cause, and the valid anxieties people might have about their futures in that context. \n\nSo I guess my advice is as follows:\n\n* If you're putting yourself out there, the \"*plenty of fish in the sea, you'll find someone when you least expect it, enjoy your single life*\" advice is good, but that doesn't mean you have to **like** it. Your frustration and anxiety are normal and rational.\n\n* If your standards aren't any more demanding than what you offer yourself, don't feel pressured to lower them. Even considering all the aforementioned societal bullshit, it's better to be single than in a relationship that doesn't make you happy.\n\n* It's probably not that you're not pretty enough or not worthy enough. It's probably just that the chances of two compatible single people encountering each other in a suitable context to spark a relationship are pretty low, so it can take a long time to get lucky.\n\n* Similarly, it's probably not that you're not putting enough effort in. For every woman who met her soulmate after spending years swiping on dating apps, there's one who randomly got chatting to someone at the same hobby group, or to a friend of a friend at some kind of social gathering.\n\n* For the love of god, don't base your self-esteem and conception of what it means to turn 30 on what men say online. A lot of that stuff originates from red pill/incel/mgtow circles, and those kinds of manosphere groups have a vested interest in making you believe that women in their thirties are old, unattractive, and unlovable. and that you're running out of time. The redpillers want to manipulate you into casual sex, and the incels want to manipulate you into a toxic relationship. Women in their late twenties and early thirties are still young and attractive, even if fertility starts to decline in your mid thirties. And frankly, as a bi woman, older women can be hot too. Have you *seen* Suranne Jones?\n\nBasically: Don't give up and don't feel ashamed or unworthy, but also, unfortunately there's no cheat code to this.

And people like soundbites and simple instructions. Nuance is hard.\n\nAs a general rule, yes, to feed everybody sustainably we should dedicate the **vast** majority of arable land to growing plants for people to eat. Every additional step you add to a food chain wastes energy, so it's far less efficient to grow soybeans for cows or grain for chickens, than it is to grow soybeans for humans to eat tofu or grain to make bread.\n\nRuminants, particularly cows, also produce a lot of methane, which is a much more potent greenhouse gas than CO2.\n\nBut there's an argument being had among climate scientists/policy advisors that methane's global warming potential ought to be understood in the context of it breaking down in the atmosphere far more quickly than CO2 does. We should definitely be trying to emit **much** less of it in the short term - over a twenty year time span, a tonne of methane does 84 times as much damage as a tonne of CO2. But the CO2 will hang around in the atmosphere for thousands of years, while the methane will start to break down after just twelve. \n\nSo as much as we need to limit methane drastically within our lifetimes to stabilise our climate, there's no reason why ruminant meat couldn't be a sustainable additional source of protein in the future. There's an awful lot of land where you just can't grow arable crops, like the uplands of the UK. And we have native breeds of cattle and sheep that are well suited to being reared on that land without too many additional input requirements.\n\nAnd popular vegan options don't tend to be anywhere near as local as the meat and dairy that we consume in the UK. Lentils tend to be grown in North Africa and the Middle East, jackfruit and banana blossom are grown in the tropics, a lot of modern dairy alternatives are coconut-based and come from South-East Asia, soybeans are only really a viable crop in the very south of England (they need mild conditions) which means most of the supply comes from the Americas, etc.\n\nRealistically the best diet that British people can choose for the environment is a diet that's seasonal, local and mostly plant based (i.e. think mushrooms, spinach, peas, and beans as protein sources and oat-milk based dairy (or potato milk, [which is apparently a thing now!](https://www.theguardian.com/food/2021/oct/26/waitrose-to-sell-potato-milk-as-demand-for-plant-based-options-grows)) over exotic foods like jackfruit or coconut milk) but that may also include local sustainably raised dairy products, and may include local sustainably produced meat, game or fish as an occasional luxury.\n\nSo not business as usual at all, but not necessarily strictly vegetarian or vegan either.", "created_utc": "1644492423.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hwcrr31", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_sozakm", "parent_id": "t1_hwcmxdz", "score": "2", "subreddit": "ukpolitics", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhcv"}, {"author": "Ardilla_", "body": "> Any kind of wide or loose jeans look like total shit on me.

They're going to be on edge. You won't brighten their day by approaching them to compliment them, you'll just stress them out, even if the compliment would have been fine in another context.\n\n* Women normally respond better to random compliments about things we've done to our appearance, or our accomplishments, rather than our physical attributes. If I'm complimenting a stranger/acquaintance/coworker, I tend to say things like \"Oooh, I love your dress\", \"your makeup looks great\", \"your hair looks nice today\", \"I love your boots!\", etc. So like, pointing out a cool article of clothing that really suits them, or how their makeup/hair/nails look if they've done them in a particularly striking or intricate way.\n\n* The best way to give a genuine, day-brightening compliment is to expect nothing in return. You're not demanding their attention, you're not imposing on their day, you're *certainly* not trying to get their number - you're just shooting them a quick, friendly, \"Omg, that thing about you is so cool! :D\" as you go on your way.\n\n* Don't force it. Sometimes someone's too far away, or the environment is too loud, or they have headphones in, or they're distracted by something else. Don't loiter around or chase someone to compliment them.

My sister was acquainted with her. That one felt very close to home.\n\nAnd there's the rarer cases of men that kill female sex workers, kill female strangers in the street, etc.\n\nThere's a common thread that runs through a lot of these cases, and it's that these men both desire and despise us, and then violently resent us for \"making them\" feel that way. \n\nAnd I don't know how to describe to men who've never felt like this that violence against women feels very *personal*.\n\nThere's violent crime that could happen to anyone, like being assaulted, or being stabbed in a mugging, or someone pushing you over and cracking your head on the pavement in a fight, or being killed during a burglary or some other crime being committed against you, or being killed in a case of mistaken identity.

So they won't recommend that 12-15 year olds get the vaccine on the basis of its direct health benefits, because they don't currently think it has any, on balance.\n\n*That said*, it's also worth thinking about the **indirect** benefits of getting vaccinated, and the **indirect** harms that may come from being unvaccinated.\n\nFor instance, missing lots of school might mean your child misses out on reaching their full academic potential and their options in life are limited, or that they miss out on seeing their friends and don't develop as well socially, etc. And bringing covid home might make their parents or grandparents ill. And of course there's the population level risk of more covid going around leading to more breakthrough infections. The JCVI doesn't consider those factors, but the government might when it makes its recommendations.\n\nIf it were me personally... I'm not actually sure what I'd do either, to be honest. My first inclination would be to get a younger child vaccinated, but leave it up to an older teenager to make their own decision after chatting to them about the potential risks and benefits.\n\nBut given that the risks of covid seem to go up with age, perhaps that's backwards, and it would be better to wait to get younger children vaccinated and strongly encourage older teens to get vaccinated?\n\nI don't really think there's a clear right or wrong answer on this one, to be honest.\n\nI think I'd be guided by your child's feelings if they feel strongly anxious one way or the other, given how rare negative effects are from both vaccination and covid.

It's okay to be skeptical and do some research first tho. That's what I did at first and this article was the first to pop up. \n\nThe thing about doing your own research and being sceptical is that you **need** to know how to critically analyse your sources.\n\nLike, looking at that website that you linked, what can we tell?\n\nIt's the website of a legal firm.\n\nThe first line of the article reads \n\n>  The national law firm of Baum Hedlund Aristei & Goldman filed a Gardasil lawsuit against Merck today on behalf of a 19-year-old woman, alleging the company misled the FDA, legislators, doctors and **moms** about the safety and efficacy of its Gardasil vaccine.\n\nHuh...? Weird to focus on mothers. Surely \"parents\" and/or \"young people\" would be a more professional way to phrase that idea. Which immediately raises the question; \"Is this written with a certain audience in mind? Why?\" \n\nNext line:\n\n> The lawsuit asserts Merck purposely downplayed the risk of Gardasil\u2019s ingredients, including a proprietary aluminum compound (a potent neurotoxin) and secret and potentially hazardous DNA particles.\n\nThat sounds scary, but isn't very specific. Which aluminium compound? Is it really 'proprietary'? Is it really a neurotoxin? Why would DNA particles be hazardous? Why would they be secret?\n\nScrolling down to scan for those keywords, they mention \"a particularly toxic aluminum-containing adjuvant \u2013 Amorphous Aluminum Hydroxyphosphate Sulfate (AAHS), which is a potent neurotoxin created by Merck, that can result in very serious harm\" and \"Gardasil contains a secret DNA adjuvant and potentially hazardous ingredient, HPV LI-DNA fragments, to make the vaccine more potent.\"\n\nSo let's google those terms.\n\nIf I google 'LI DNA fragment', the only thing that really comes up is [an article](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20120808006480/en/SaneVax-Announces-Medical-Surprise-Gardasil%C2%AE-HPV-DNA-Discovered-in-Post-Mortem-Blood-and-Spleen-Tissue) quoting a pathologist talking about an autopsy where HPV gene fragments, including a gene called L1, were found in post-mortem samples taken from a girl who died after being vaccinated. He doesn't directly blame the vaccine for her death, but claims that the DNA may have caused some kind of reaction\n\nThe article is a press release from an organisation called \"SaneVax Inc\", which sounds *more than a little bit* like a sketchy antivax group.\n\nWho is this doctor? If we google him, a [book](https://www.waterstones.com/book/from-pap-smears-to-hpv-vaccines/dr-sin-hang-lee//9781536188103) called \"From Pap Smears to HPV Vaccines: Evolution of the Cervical Cancer Prevention Industry\" comes up. And the blurb suggests he has an axe to grind with the entire medical area of cervical cancer prevention. He seems sceptical that HPV causes cancer, and outright says \"there is no factual evidence that HPV vaccination has prevented a single case of cervical cancer\", which rings alarm bells, given that there absolutely is ([Source: Cancer Research UK, quoting a peer-reviewed study that followed 1.5 million girls and women over 11 years](https://news.cancerresearchuk.org/2020/10/01/hpv-vaccine-reduces-cervical-cancer-risk)), and that that study was published *before* the book.\n\nWhich scientific publisher in their right mind would touch this with a bargepole? Apparently [Nova Science Publishers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nova_Science_Publishers), which \"has been criticized for not always evaluating authors through the academic peer review process\".\n\nHow did a pathologist with a bias against cervical cancer vaccines come to do an analysis on this girl who died? The article above said that he gave evidence at the request of her parents. Was her death really related to the vaccine, or does anyone else have a different opinion? \n\n[A news article on her death](https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/health/76303256/no-evidence-that-hpv-vaccine-caused-an-upper-hutt-teenagers-unexplained-death) says that her mother blamed the vaccine, which she had last been given **six months** before her death. The coroner didn't agree, and said \"The evidence falls far short of establishing that Jasmine's death was due to the adverse effects of her vaccinations.\" New Zealand's medical safety regulator said that the illness she was apparently suffering could be easily explained as side effects of her contraceptive injection, but that neither the HPV vaccine or the contraceptive injection were at all likely to have killed her. Her family refused to be tested to see if they had any heart conditions that Jasmine might have inherited.\n\nSo a doctor with a bias against cervical cancer vaccination made some comments about the unexplained death of a teenager six months after being vaccinated, at the request of her seemingly antivax parents (If it were my daughter, I would want to pursue all angles and get to the bottom of what happened. Why did they not follow up on the heart tests?) and the legal firm heading that lawsuit thinks that's credible evidence...?\n\nAnd, as if by magic, at the very bottom of the article on the legal firm's website:\n\n> About Baum Hedlund Aristei & Goldman\n\n> Baum Hedlund Aristei & Goldman is one of the nation\u2019s leading law firms representing victims harmed by the Gardasil HPV vaccine.

So far, we represent two dozen clients but expect to see these numbers grow rapidly as we are receiving hundreds of calls now that the word is out that plaintiffs can sue Merck in civil court if cases do not resolve in vaccine court.\n\nAnd further down still:\n\n> Contact us\n\n> Were you or a loved one administered the Gardasil vaccine?\n\n> Age of patient when they received the Gardasil vaccine?\n\n> Please list adverse symptoms that were experienced due to the Gardasil vaccine\n\n> [etc]\n\n**The whole article is an advert for new legal clients.**\n\nThey want worried antivax/vaccine sceptical mothers of teenagers with chronic illnesses (inflammatory disorders, chronic fatigue, reproductive disorders, POTs, etc, are among those listed on their website) to pay them to take on an expensive, protracted legal battle against a large pharmaceutical company.\n\nYou'll note that [on their page about their Gardasil work](https://www.baumhedlundlaw.com/prescription-drugs/gardasil-lawsuit/) they claim to be the \"Leading Gardasil Lawyers in the Country\" and among their reasons to choose them they list \"Over $4 Billion in Verdicts & Settlements\" and \"$2.055 Billion Verdict, the Second-Largest Personal Injury Verdict in the Nation in 2019, and the Ninth-Largest Personal Injury Verdict in American History\".\n\nWhich is very cleverly worded to make you think \"*Oh wow, they must be winning these Gardasil cases!*\"\n\nExcept that if you scroll down further, they list a whole bunch of cases they've won, and *none* of them are HPV vaccine related. The $2 billion verdict they brag about at the top (and their second biggest win of $290 million) was against Monsanto related to the [Roundup weedkiller cancer controversy](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/24/business/roundup-settlement-lawsuits.html). **They haven't won a single Gardasil case yet \u2014 if they had, they'd be shouting it from the rooftops.** \n\n> Misinformation is so spread nowadays it's hard to tell apart\n\nIt is, and it's a crying shame that more classroom time isn't devoted to helping students identify it.

Both peoples believe that the land is their home, that they were forcibly removed from it, and that they have the right to control it and expel the other group. \n\nGenerally what happens is that tensions increase up until the point that Israel does something that really upsets Palestinians (e.g. I think this time there were clashes at a holy site in Jerusalem that's revered by both Jews and Muslims during Ramadan prayers), Palestinian militants will fire a barrage of low-tech rockets at Israel, and Israel's fancy rocket defence system (the Iron Dome) will intercept nearly all of them. In retaliation, Israel will fire quite advanced missiles back at Palestine \u2014 often into civilian areas because the militants live there too \u2014 and as Palestine doesn't have a missile defence system, the result is mass devastation.\n\nIsrael sees this as self-defence. Which is more than a little dubious, given the huge gulf in damage and fatalities caused. But it's not hard to see why they go scorched earth on people trying to kill them, given the long history of people persecuting Jews and committing genocide against them, and the fact that all of their neighbouring countries would dearly love to destroy them.\n\nOne might ask \"why on earth do the militants fire rockets when they know they're outgunned?\"\n\nThe answer to that is that the Israeli government keeps oppressing them, evicting them, and encouraging Israeli settlements in what's supposed to be Palestinian land according to UN consensus. They see it as the only thing they can do to resist.\n\nVarious attempts at solutions have been made, including two state solutions like the one I alluded to above, where Israel has some of the land and Palestine has some of the land. Another solution might be a single secular state where Arabs and Jews live together as fellow citizens.\n\nBut ultimately there's been so much bloodshed that the Palestinians are like \"No, we want all the land, it was ours before the Israelis were given the land by Western powers in the 1940s, and it should still be ours now\", and the Israelis are like \"No, *we* want all the land, or at least control over as much of the land as we can get, in order to make our country secure and provide a safe homeland for Jewish people.

[Its leopard enclosure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhBNiHNH0Sk) is a purpose built breeding and reintroduction facility for the [Amur leopard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amur_leopard), which is critically endangered. In 1997, it was estimated that there were only 19-26 leopards remaining in the wild, due to poaching and habitat degradation.\n\nConservation efforts on the ground have improved matters somewhat, with the population having increased to 90 wild leopards. But lack of genetic diversity is a massive problem, and the species could still disappear due to that lack of diversity even if humans and human activity were no longer a threat to them.\n\nLuckily, a captive breeding programme was started in the 1960s, and scientists have found that the captive amur leopard population [has much higher genetic diversity](https://academic.oup.com/jhered/article/93/5/303/2187228) than exists in the wild population, and that two of the 'founder individuals' of the captive breeding programme had genes that no wild leopard today shares.\n\nZoos have been a vital part of maintaining that genetic diversity. They host the leopards around the word, breed them according to the instructions of scientists from the conservation programme (who have a full family tree and a lot of genetic data), and educate the public about the issues facing the leopards and what's being done to save them. And they work with on-the-ground conservation groups like ALTA - the Amur Leopard and Tiger Alliance - that work with governments and other stakeholders to protect the natural environment that the leopards rely on and eventually reintroduce them. \n\nWithout good zoos with a strong commitment to aiding conservation efforts, conservation groups alone would find it far harder to save the species that they want to protect.\n\n---\n\n\\* at least in most European countries - I know the situation in the US and other countries can vary, and there can be a mix of good zoos and *terrible* Tiger King-esque zoos.", "created_utc": "1620828646.0", "edited": "False", "id": "gxusklp", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_nab0cu", "parent_id": "t1_gxubm64", "score": "3", "subreddit": "Zoomies", "subreddit_id": "t5_3bd7e"}, {"author": "Ardilla_", "body": "> Electoral reform is a safer bet - catchy slogan \"strong government is not fair government\".\n\nI think you might be coming at this from the perspective of someone who's already convinced of the need for reform. \n\nThat slogan only really works if you mentally associate 'strong government' with 'authoritarian' and 'uncaring', and 'fair government' with 'just' and 'good'.\n\nIf you associate 'strong government' with 'protective' and 'decisive', and 'fair government' with 'idealistic', then you might be susceptible to arguments that proportional representation of all the parties would lead to indecision, endlesss arguing, and political paralysis that would doom the country in a crisis (e.g. the one we just went through).\n\nI think a better angle is pointing out the massive disconnect between the way the country votes and the makeup of parliament.

When I did drive, I much preferred passing a cyclist in a cycle lane to a cyclist on the road!\n\n* People like me (aka. those of us who aren't young/middle aged, middle class, physically fit, confident and assertive men) feel confident to cycle instead of buying a car, meaning fewer cars on the road getting in your way and taking up parking spaces. Don't think of it as the hardcore 'lycra louts' you see cycling in your city now getting a whole lane to themselves \u2014 think of the people who feel comfortable cycling in more cycle-friendly cities like Cambridge or York. Teenagers going to school, rather than being dropped off by their parents. Families cycling with kids. Women. Older people. Maybe even you, sometimes, if you only have to nip across town for something.\n\nThere's obviously some unavoidable annoyance when roadworks pop up in order to make a new cycle lane, but surely ripping an existing lane out just adds *more* roadworks?", "created_utc": "1620724100.0", "edited": "False", "id": "gxpjr4p", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_n9jciu", "parent_id": "t1_gxp9wp6", "score": "24", "subreddit": "ukpolitics", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhcv"}, {"author": "Ardilla_", "body": "> It's not a con - it's simply that the councils in the rich areas don't need to spend as much money\n\nNobody's saying that the system is deliberately set up to fuck over the poor.

She told the Guardian that Clarke would constantly harass her, on one occasion telling her that, when he hired her, he had planned \u201cto fuck her and fire her\u201d before deciding to keep her on. She also alleges that Clarke would brag about storing sexually explicit pictures and videos on his hard drive, including footage he told her he had secretly filmed during naked auditions.\n\n> Powell says Clarke once showed her a secretly recorded video of one such audition with Jahannah James, an actor in Brotherhood. Powell told four people about Clarke\u2019s alleged secret filming, all of whom confirmed the conversation to the Guardian. They include James, her friend, whom she told about the incident in the winter of 2017, in a pub in south London. The naked audition had taken place more than four years previously, for the film Legacy. Powell was able to describe the exact haircut James had at that time \u2013 her hair is usually long and blond, but after a \u201chair disaster\u201d she had cropped it short and returned to her natural brown.\n\n> James recalls Clarke had talked her into auditioning for the role. She had been hesitant. She was only 23 and fresh out of drama school. But Clarke persuaded her, explaining that the naked audition wouldn\u2019t be filmed; an email from her agent confirmed this agreement. \u201cI was told 100% it was not going to be on camera,\u201d James says. As she understood it, the naked audition was purely to check she could do the scene and wasn\u2019t going to \u201cbottle it\u201d on the day.\n\n> The audition was mortifying, James recalls, and afterwards she pulled out of the running for the role; she didn\u2019t want one of her first acting jobs to be nude. The Guardian spoke to two friends of Powell and James who were also present in the pub that day and recalled the emotional exchange. \u201cI was so upset,\u201d James recalls. \u201cNow, years later, I still cry when I talk about it.\u201d", "created_utc": "1620656544.0", "edited": "False", "id": "gxlzwqw", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_n8rncj", "parent_id": "t1_gxlw3fg", "score": "34", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i"}, {"author": "Ardilla_", "body": "> even the grass is maintained, not in a wild state\n\nNobody's going around 'maintaining' the grass.

At this event, Graham alleges that Clarke sexually harassed her and touched her inappropriately under the table they were both sitting at.\n\n> \u201cHe would literally lean in and grab the outside of my thigh,\u201d Graham recalled. On one occasion, she said, Clarke attempted to touch her inner thigh. \u201cIt started out on the knee,\u201d she said, \u201cbut there was a point where he tried to lean towards my inner thigh, and I physically moved my chair to get away.\u201d\n\n> When women walked past their stand, Graham said, Clarke would rate them out of 10 in terms of sexual attractiveness, and make derogatory and disrespectful comments.\n\n> She also alleged that Clarke repeatedly asked her to have sex with him. Because they were both in public, Graham said she did not feel physically threatened by Clarke. However, she found his comments to be \u201cdisgusting\u201d.

There are three types of faith state school, and the distinction doesn't really matter here. Funding will come from either the local or national government and a local religious group. (E.g. a Catholic diocese)\n\n2. Faith schools have to follow the national curriculum, but don't have to teach about other faiths during R.E. They might also push more religion on students than the bare minimum required (see point 3), such as hymns, prayers, religious extra-curricular activities, participation in local church events, etc.\n\n3.

You have to remember that at that point in time, the big pharmaceutical companies were all racing to be the first to bring a safe and effective vaccine to market.\n\nThe government wanted that clause in the contract because Oxford University's research on coronaviruses and adenovirus vectors had been publicly funded by government grants.

It's a trait that lies on the X chromosome, so males only have to inherit one copy of the gene to be ginger (because there isn't a second coat colour gene on the Y chromosome), while females have to inherit two copies - one from each parent.\n\n> I don't know that I'd say 20% is *extremely* rare, given that if the trait wasn't linked to sex you'd have a 50:50 split... but it would be accurate to say that there are four times as many male ginger cats as female ones.\n\n> Male tortoiseshell cats **are** extremely rare though.  In female mammals, there's something called \"[X inactivation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-inactivation)\" - basically, you only need one X chromosome to be active, so at a certain point in embryonic development, cells randomly silence one of the X chromosomes. \n\n> And then the cells keep dividing, and all the cells descending from cells with the X chromosome you inherited from your mother will only express that chromosome, while cells descending from cells with the X you inherited from your father will only express that chromosome. And so when the baby is born they're like an invisible patchwork. ([Here's a short Veritasium video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BD6h-wDj7bw) that might explain this more clearly than I can without visual aids)\n\n> The tortoiseshell pattern happens when a female cat carries a ginger gene on one X chromosome and a brown/black gene on the other X chromosome. The genes are co-dominant, meaning that neither is dominant over the other. So if a female cat has a ginger father and a brown mother, that genetic patchwork suddenly becomes visible. All the skin cells expressing her father's X chromosome will be ginger, and all the skin cells expressing her mother's X chromosome will be brown.\n\n> Because tortoiseshell colouration requires two X chromosomes, it can normally only happen in female cats. Occasionally it can also happen if a male cat is born with an XXY chromosomal abnormality, but that has an occurrence rate of around 1 in 3000.", "created_utc": "1618521776.0", "edited": "False", "id": "gunhk1v", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_mriw87", "parent_id": "t1_gunbtlw", "score": "14", "subreddit": "aww", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1o"}, {"author": "Ardilla_", "body": "Yeah, *g\u00fcisqui* is whiskey.\n\nMy favourite loanword that I've come across while practicing my spanish might be *ualab\u00ed*, or wallaby.

The format can be quite good for productive discussions when a sub is well-moderated\" \u2014 or they're regular Reddit users.\n\nSo my personal expectation would be for the percentage of women here to be much higher then 5%.\n\nAnd if I had to guess why women are underrepresented here, it *would* be the widespread perception that it's a waste of time arguing about the political issues that most affect us with the type of men who like to debate politics on reddit.

My new flatmate and I were discussing all this last night. She told me hers. I told her mine.\n\nWe're talking about this very primal fear of being hunted in the night by predators who look no different to men.
