So, yes. \n\nOn a side-note: I understand why you'd think she could have BPD. But at the same time, I don't see it. I'm only talking about the cartoon, BTW.\n\nIn the show, Azula doesn't have mood swings. She is not as violent or destructive as other firebenders.\n\nShe doesn't idolize anyone but her own country/people. She knows what her father is, that's why she says \"you can't treat me like Zuko\". She strives to keep him happy in order not to get treated like, well, Zuko.\n\nShe is a perfectionist out of survival (in fact, her most toxic behaviors are a response to the environment she was raised in). Charm, efficiency and a silver-tongue will get you everywhere in a royal court.\n\nAnd she doesn't blame her misfortunes on anyone but herself. Even the mirror scene shows us that she blames herself, once again, \"what choice do *I* have?\" Is the perfect quote to exemplify this. \n\n\"My own mother thought I was a monster. SHE WAS RIGHT.

She will only need sleep (valerian leaves might help), yoga and willpower. Ideally, you'd remove the person from the source of stress for a while.\n\nWhat if you want to believe that she had qigong deviation? A healer might help help with the appropriate exercises.\n\nWhat if it wasn't her mental illness flaring up but her conscience? Zuko had a fever and nightmares when he was undergoing a change. This could be Azula's manifestation of said change - the mirror scene is very telling. She knows that her methods failed and \"fear\" only brought her loneliness and pain in the end, but she doesn't know how to change. \"What choice do I have?\"*\n\nHonestly, if I were to give her a \"mental illness\", I wouldn't say Schizophrenia or Narcissistic Personality Disorder/NPD (as some people are keen to diagnose her with) because:\n\n(a) Schizophrenia is rare. And no one gets it right. There are some people without family history who develop the illness, sure. Nonetheless, The Fire Nation Royal Family has no family history of schizophrenia in the show. Why should we believe that schizophrenia is what she has? A stress-induced (nervous) breakdown is more likely than what you think. \n\n(b) Azula is a Princess. A member of the Royal Family from the most powerful country in the world (which was true up to the finale). She is not a Disney princess. The only person who surpasses her in rank is the Fire Lord. Her behavior is not representative of NPD. \n\nThe mental illness I'd give her (if I had to give her one) is: *ANXIETY* (with a parent like Ozai, who wouldn't suffer from anxiety? She might have abandonment issues from Ursa. And yadayada.)\n\n...\n\nThe thing is, it depends on how you read that scene. I personally believe that Azula was undergoing a great change.
