Major-specific courses don't come in usually until later in the program. For this reason, unlike the UK system, the curricula are not tailored to the specific discipline from the start. Universities give recommendations or \"study plans\" instead, but the undergraduate can make changes to it depending on the total number of credits and the availability of the course.\n\nI graduated from a university based on the US system, and how we did it, we had a set of subjects that are taken by every discipline, and then a set of subjects that are specific to the school that the major belongs to (Engineering, Arts and Sciences, Business, etc.), and finally a set of courses that are specific to the major. There are also optional subjects called electives from each set that an undergraduate can take. Many courses become available to the student after having completed the required subjects for that course, and those subjects are the \"prerequisites\" that will pop up more as one goes deep into the major. This is the purpose of those \"study plans\": later, major-specific courses don't open until their prerequisites have been completed.\n\nNote that for the reasons above, changing degrees works out depending on the major you started with and the major you want to change to. For example, changing between Mechanical Engineering and Chemical Engineering early is fairly easy because they may have some Engineering courses that are common between them. On the other hand, changing between Mechanical Engineering and Psychology is much harder because they have even fewer courses in common.", "created_utc": "1650057055.0", "edited": "1650079934.0", "id": "i4vp33y", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_u46yf7", "parent_id": "t1_i4ulcwe", "score": "7", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "AvdaxNaviganti", "body": "A myriad is ten thousand.

The most common way to number their compositions is the opus number (**\"Op.\"**), which depends on the date of their publication.\n\nWhen two or more separate pieces are released together as a bundle, they're each distinguished by **\"No.\"**.

Mozart's pieces are numbered using the Koechel catalog (**\"K.\"**), which was sorted into a list by Ludwig von Koechel in the 1860s.\n\nEtudes, preludes and sonatas are types of works, usually for piano. **Sonatas** are more broadly a work of three or four movements (but not always), and the first movement generally follow the sonata form. They got their start during the Classical era, at least from the 1750s.\n\n**Etudes**, meaning study, are \"study pieces\", which are composed in such a way to perfect a particular skill.

One of the sections of that broadcast involved students from Hida High School in Gifu and relaxing restrictions on their school uniform. They successfully petitioned to their school board to fulfill the desired changes, which included allowing the students to wear black tights instead of the mandatory beige ones.\n\nThe surroundings of that school were somehow all too familiar to me, from the opening shot of a school building's corner to the pan shots of the school grounds. I had an inkling of why that's the case, and looking up Hida High School confirmed it for me. Apparently, that was *the* school that was the basis of Kamiyama High School: it was the basis of the setting of *Hyouka*. Since then, I couldn't stop imagining the Classic Lit Club entertaining themselves about those changes and petitioning for them, even though I don't think they'd have much of an opinion about wearing tights...\n\nAlso apparently, Hida High's uniform is similar to that of Kamiyama's by design, but the uniform itself is black instead of white. And it turned out that real life high school skirts aren't as short as they're shown to be in anime, since the students in Hida wear skirts that reach below the knee.

These situations regarding object pronouns as subjects - in sentences beginning with phrases like \"She and I went...\" and \"Her and me went...\" - are caused by a phenomenon* called \"hypercorrection\". This is typically caused by alternate interpretations of a rule or convention made to reconcile perceived errors in use of a language, or sometimes its different registers. \"Hypercorrection\" literally means \"too much correction\", i.e. correcting yourself to the point of \"making a mistake\".\n\nIn your case, and this is where I speculate, something like \"between you and me\" and \"for him and her\" is correct grammar that is widely used. We almost never use two subject pronouns together, when we'd instead use \"we\" or \"they\". Because the formula \"me and you\", etc. is widespread, we only ever see two pronouns linked together when they're both in the oblique form (as objects), so we think that this is the \"correct\" form, and we end up using that form everywhere else, despite grammar rules dictating otherwise. That bleeds into forms where one of the subjects is a noun.\n\n[This paper should give you some more info about hypercorrection involving pronouns, as well as linked pronouns that you have questions about](https://web.stanford.edu/~zwicky/Grano.finalthesis.pdf).\n\n*Prescriptivists would replace \"phenomenon\" with \"mistake\", and while I personally use something to the effect of \"She and I went...\", the other form is found in a lot of places.", "created_utc": "1570801669.0", "edited": "1570801873.0", "id": "f3b4th3", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_dgdc72", "parent_id": "t3_dgdc72", "score": "4", "subreddit": "linguistics", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhos"}, {"author": "AvdaxNaviganti", "body": "I don't think there'd be a special term for that, because I believe this phenomenon has less to do with ditching the \"English name\" for the \"native name\", and more to do with simply ditching one name for another name.

This is hardly an issue that concerns linguistics.\n\nIt's also worth nothing that all this hubbub regarding Eswatini was borne out of a decision not made by prescriptivists, but by the Swazi government (and by \"government\", I mean its king), partially to disambiguate Swaziland from Switzerland.

To put it simply, what u/Shigofumi said.\n\nIn streaming anime to a market outside Japan, there are two points to consider:\n\n* Point A: **profit returns**, on the part of the streaming service.\n\n* Point B: **licensing considerations**, on the part of the anime producers. It's more or less Point A but for the companies that make up one show's production committee. Exclusive distribution rights fall under this point as well, since the committee would have only one channel to invest for their anime to be consumed abroad.\n\nIn theory, a streaming service that hosts all anime can exist. But in practice, it wouldn't be very profitable. That's because while a couple of anime do have a lot of watchers to send in enough revenue to satisfy Points A and B, a far larger amount of anime will not be watched enough to do the same. A single streaming service would have to satisfy the demands of a boatload of companies that produce different kinds of anime, not all of which will be consumed enough to send in revenue. As a result, the streaming service would have to make-do and choose the shows that can satisfy the market demand and fulfill both Points.\n\nFollowing from that last sentence, this causes the third point:\n\n* Point C: **a gap in demand**.\n\nThat's where competing streaming services come in. They would be there to fill that gap by hosting anime that other services did not provide, or that they could otherwise host in competition. Points A and B would then kick in for that situation. And taking these Points in circles, this is how we get different streaming sites streaming different anime.\n\nInside Japan, the same Points work for television stations, which is why anime shows are broadcast across various channels there.", "created_utc": "1566694355.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ey1akm1", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_cum42a", "parent_id": "t1_ey10qwn", "score": "3", "subreddit": "anime", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh22"}, {"author": "AvdaxNaviganti", "body": "The main exception to that, of course, is when the studio itself heads the production committee.

I watched the first episode many months ago, but I was a bit baffled at first, and I had a hard time following everything. From that, though, I can still recall an impression that I made back then: this art style is a continuation of the one used in the K-On Movie, and if a K-On Season 3 were made immediately after it, the team would adapt its art style there, which is a refinement of that of Season 2. But aside from that, I couldn't get into Tamako Market back then, so I left it.\n\nBut last week, I saw a lot of tribute videos for KyoAni, as it had been days after the arson attack. Many of these videos featured Tamako Market, and seeing those, I thought that I must've missed a lot in that show, so I thought of watching it again. Of course, I began with a rewatch of Episode 1 rather than going straight to Episode 2, and after having made myself familiar of that episode from my first attempt earlier, I can say that I got the proper feel of the show.\n\nThat said, thus far I can already describe Tamako Market with a single word: **feminine**. Between the animation styles, the characters and their dialog and dynamic, this show is filled to the brim with wholesome femininity. I can't say a lot because I'm still halfway there, but I've been loving it a lot. I can't really classify Tamako Market as a \"Cute Girls Doing Cute Things\" show like its sister anime K-On, because nothing in it seems to be written in for the purpose of eliciting a moe reaction, but rather just to show how the girls go about their lives, even though the episodes I've seen so far focus on special days like New Year's Eve, Valentine's Day or School Field Trip.\n\nAs for the characters, I can't pick a favorite and least favorite character because I had a great time watching each of them. And even though some people might find Dera annoying, I actually found him amusing, especially when he interacts with characters other than Tamako. Even the side characters were fun to watch like the shop owners in the Shopping Arcade. [Hell, I found this guy amusing by appearance](https://www.anime-planet.com/images/characters/kaoru-hanase-46437.jpg) because he looked as if he came straight out of the Kalos region. Seeing them together in Episode 6, I was laughing a lot the entire way, and it's my favorite episode of the show so far.\n\nBut out of the characters, I've been keeping an eye on two of them: Shiori and Anko. From everything Shiori's been doing since her debut in the third episode, I couldn't help but will her on whenever she has a desire to finish something or be part of her group of firends, probably to the point of wanting to tell her to GANBATTE, especially in Episode 6. As for Anko, her personality as a whole was interesting, as were the times she and Dera are in the same room. Also, before I started watching again, I always got her name wrong, calling her \"Anzu\" instead. But after watching, I saw that she somehow shares some mannerisms with Azusa from K-On like in speech, so I adopted \"Anzu\" as a definite nickname for Anko. Maybe she'll put on cat ears later in the show as well? :P\n\nI'm gonna guess no. :/\n\nI'll continue my watch-through with Episode 7 later today, and I'll probably finish it off within this week with the Movie. I can't wait, but I'm gonna miss this show a lot once I'm done.\n\n[Now if only ](/s \"Tamako wouldn't stay as dense as a lead block by then. :P\")", "created_utc": "1564397620.0", "edited": "False", "id": "evbwb9e", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_cizszx", "parent_id": "t3_cizszx", "score": "3", "subreddit": "anime", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh22"}, {"author": "AvdaxNaviganti", "body": "Yes.

The line designs of S2 are much sharper than S1's, the hair isn't as floofy (as in it doesn't go all over the place) and has more color contrast, so the hair doesn't look too metallic and mute. The difference that I *do* notice between the designs of S1 and S2 is that the cheekbones in S1 are more prominent, and the corners of the face are somewhat sharper. It's more obvious in 3/4 view, where the outline dips closer towards the bottom of the eyes, and then curves back away before suddenly turning to the chin. You could say that the cuteness found in S1 is refined by S2. That, and the glorious, *glorious* ambient lighting.\n\nWhen I watched the Movie for the first time, I noticed the difference from S2 right off the bat. The eyes are smaller in proportion to the face and they are drawn more sharply by the outside curves. Mio's eyes in the Movie aren't as prominently pointed and \"tsurime\" compared to the manga and anime. Their side profiles are also longer and more sharply drawn. As a result, they don't look as cute as they did in S2, but they look more mature, and in some scenes, [they can look very beautiful](https://i.imgur.com/OSV07JT.jpg). I liked Azusa best [with the design of the Movie](https://i.imgur.com/lmQzlQt.jpg). She looks much older in it, like a proper seventeen-year-old senpai-to-be.

I noticed from K-On Shuffle how the art style diverged almost completely from that of the original manga from 2007, and it's about the same with the Kirara Fantasia game. I observed a similar happening in the anime, between the two seasons and especially the movie. I put together this comparison and see side by side how they were turning out.\n\nThese have been the art styles used in the manga and the anime, respectively by original artist Kakifly and Yukiko Horiguchi, character designer and chief animation director. I'd like to prefix some points, though:\n\n1. The years shown are the years of release (circulation for the manga, broadcast for the anime). The actual times the examples shown were drawn are some time before the indicated year, and I couldn't have been able to determine when exactly they were drawn.\n\n2. The volume covers are not uniform in style, because they were drawn for the compiled volumes in the time they were set for release. Volume 1 Yui and Volume 4 Mugi are not drawn in the exact same style, as the latter (of course) was very likely drawn much later.\n\n3. While Horiguchi headed the character design, the animation, and therefore the art style, can differ between different KyoAni staff. The animations' designs do not vary *that* much, and it's definitely more obvious when the actual animation is in play. That said, Horiguchi's base designs still hold, so I'm basing it on that.\n\n4. I'm also taking that Kakifly is also the artist for the keions in the Kirara Fantasia game, since he's credited as such in the game's website. That, and they seem to match with their appearances in Shuffle, which started circulation in the same month as the keions' game debut, and the game designs might have been drawn simultaneously with the manga before the latter's circulation.\n\n5.

I found this an interesting read in learning kanji, even though much of it is outdated today.\n\nThe Hyougaiji (rare-use kanji, literally kanji \"outside the table\") would not be developed as a concept until 1946, when the Toyuou kanji (\"general-use kanji\") was put together, charting the kanji to be used on a daily basis and excluding those more rarely used. The Touyou kanji table would be expanded and reintroduced as the Jouyou kanji (\"regular-use kanji\") decades later, which is in use today. Despite this, this work had already set apart the kanji that were commonly used that time, from the characters that were very rarely used in the Japanese language, what would be later known as the Hyougaiji. A partial list of these characters was included as an appendix to the above book, prefaced with a word of note before studying them.\n\nIf the text in the image is unreadable, the transcript of the preface is relayed below:\n\n>The following list includes 2,040 Chinese characters which occupy, broadly speaking, the second rank, and which the more ambitious student, perfect in the 2,490 Common Characters treated of so far, may look on as his next, his final prey. This list is believed to exhaust the number of practically useful characters, so that he who know them all would be no longer a student, but a scholar. The characters are given in the order of their Radicals. We incline to think, however, that rather than attack them in this order, the best plan to pursue would be to learn first whichever chanced to come first in the reading of miscellaneous Japanese texts, and so to tick them off gradually. In any case it will be wise to pass over altogether, without attempting to remember them, any characters *not* given in this list; for it is foolish to waste time over rare words in any language. Whole pages may be found in the \"Century Dictionary\", where even an educated Anglo-Saxon reader perceives none but unfamiliar terms.

It started as  work by Kakifly back in 2007. TBS would decide to release an adaptation of the manga later, and commissioned Kyoto Animation to make one. K-On Season 1 premiered late at night that time, airing episodes every Friday at 1:59 am Japan time on TBS (TV schedules would, however, show that they premiere every Thursday at \"25:59\", but they mean the same thing.). Episode 1, however, premiered at 2:09 am. The first broadcasts on TBS were in 4:3; the widescreen version would be released a few weeks later and every week onwards on BS-TBS.\n\nIn spite of this late premiere, nobody could have foreseen what K-On would have wrought across the Land of the Rising Sun. Nobody would have known what a huge success it would become. It would go on to sweep Japan in the coming weeks and years, charting high in the Japanese music charts, ushering in a wave of sales in guitars and instruments (a lot by high school girls, no less), breaking records in Blu-ray sales which was novel at the time, recognized even by the anime industry as a notable work to be followed as an example, starting real life school light music clubs from Hokkaido to Okinawa, and becoming starting points for real-life musicians and anime voice actors. Even ten years later, K-On is still well-known and regarded as a classic in Japan, and is among the shows that stood out in the anime scene, despite being handled by first-time series director Naoko Yamada.\n\nIt all started with a girl who was late for school and needed to run to catch up, clutching her toast with her mouth. It all started with how her trip got sidetracked because she was distracted. It all started with how she was panting as she faced her new school, only to discover that she was actually early. And from it started this precious thing that we fans here hold dear, even after all these years, be those who have been fans since 2009, or those who hopped along after it ended.

But in my view - and I'm speaking as a do-and-see viewer of SvtFoE - that's it. The bond through the curse is deleted, but from the Blood Moon Ball onwards, they developed a bond through something else, and we have seen it all unfold in the episodes since.\n\nBut then, I guess that particular bond was completely platonic, as apparently, they stopped having romantic feelings for each other, since Marco now views Star as a \"best friend\" again. \n\nTracing from this, that kind of implies that the Blood Moon Ball WAS the moment they fell in love, and all the moments we saw since - feelings of envy when Star and Marco see the other with Jackie and Tom respectively (spitefully and wistfully), Star's confession to Marco at the end of Season 2, their discomfort in Booth Buddies and their efforts to reconcile leading up to the kiss - were dictates of that event.

And when they were come, they say unto him, Master, we know that thou art true, and carest for no man: for thou regardest not the person of men, but teachest the way of God in truth: Is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar, or not? Shall we give, or shall we not give? But he, knowing their hypocrisy, said unto them, Why tempt ye me? bring me a penny, that I may see it. And they brought it. And he saith unto them, Whose is this image and superscription? And they said unto him, Caesar's. **And Jesus answering said unto them, Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's.** And they marvelled at him. (Mark 12:13-17)\n\nThis talks about rendering taxes, not sharing the commonwealth of the earth, let alone a commandment saying so.\n\nAnd as a side note, nowhere in the Bible did Jesus say anything about wealth being sinful. On the other hand, Jesus preached about **the love of wealth** being not only sinful, but also a hindrance to their faith, something you'd hardly find in Christians anyway.

They dislike how the riches of a particular, very prosperous country are shared among a select population (namely, citizens in those countries) because they see the world as divided between the poor and the rich instead of between nation A and nation B. It is because they believe that **every** person is entitled to equal wealth, no matter how much or little effort they make to get as far as they did, and nobody should have wealth and power through which they can \"trample over the less fortunate\". Just like those political cartoons where a poor person in tattered clothes gazes at a shiny, pearly-white, well-tended mansion, with a hopeless face while clutching its barred fences, these leftists view this border crisis this way.\n\nAdd in the pointer that some countries are better than others in some metric, most often economic, as well as an administration which *does* pursue a nation-state with security, and you have an imperialist Great Satan that must be reviled in every way, and whose borders be demolished so \"the poor from across the border\" can share those riches and be as prosperous as the rich, \"as prosperous as\" in the literal sense. Leftists in the US hate that their country is very, very rich while \"poorer people suffer for a better living\" south of the border, and that the US \"uses her wealth to make other, less developed countries do her bidding\", hence how they \"love illegals but hate America\".\n\nYou can see it in this comment saying that ICE be tried for crimes against **humanity**, not crimes against the law of whatever country if they could be tried at all. The usual job of ICE, apparently, denies the welfare of every human being, a crime akin to genocide. It's conventional and legal procedure that if a person from across a national border crosses it illegally and then gets caught, that person is detained before being tried and deported. Those people are tried as illegally-entering aliens, plainly and succinctly.\n\nBut how dare these border agents capture these people and held in confinement! How could these heartless forces treat these innocent and poor people who want a better living even worse, like slaves... like animals... like Jews in a concentration camp! Like any enemy of the far left and any supporters of nations who believe in national security, ICE must be... they must be Nazis! They should be tried like the Nazis that they are for crimes against humanity!\n\nThis is, at the very least, how I observe how radical leftists view this crisis.

Plus, each chapter is eight pages and about 15 four-panel strips long, so I hope we don't end up having to dig too much for material to discuss from a single chapter before the next one becomes available.\n\nAs for your topic, I've always thought that Japanese schools hold festivals at different dates, and not just in a single time frame. But in hindsight, the middle of the fall is the best time to hold school festivals due to the weather and its placement in the Japanese school year, so the festivals are concentrated at that time frame. That said, since there's no sign of them aiming at a specific event, I'm going to assume that Sakuragaoka High's Festival takes place after [What's the name of Yukari's high school???] High. That, and we don't see the rest of the latter school prepping for anything.\n\n**Add'l note:** As I was writing this comment, I found out that [most Japanese schools hold festivals during the weekends close to November 3rd](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/atlas/japanese/school.html), which is Culture Day in the country.

I'm getting into that, but I can say there's enough development in it for me to make simple-structured phrases. Right now, I Khot is for the most part a head-final language, with the verb last but the order of almost everything else before it is flexible, since the markers determine the nouns' cases; the first word of the phrase is sometimes taken as its topic. Verbs and adjectives are conjugated the same way, but its main conjugations differ between attributive and terminal.\n\nAside from these points, there's some more that needed developing, particularly with plurals and adverbs. I might have to try out more sentences to see if the grammar is adequately functional, and I'll do that through the activities in this subreddit.\n\nAs for the tones, sort of. I Khot started off as spreadsheets that I made on a whim last year, in which I paired CV clusters to create syllables. I thought of adding in tones after I observed how East and Southeast Asian languages integrate tones and pitch accents into syllables. While I did set some tones to specific endings in my spreadsheets, some combos ended up becoming more prevalent than I thought. I didn't notice that until you pointed out the syllables with the falling tone and after I went through past sentences that I made.\n\nI wish I would be able to provide a recording as well, but I didn't have time to prepare one during the past two days, and pronouncing the sentence is actually harder than I thought. :/ I'll try to provide examples in the future, though.", "created_utc": "1549186986.0", "edited": "False", "id": "efne8yh", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_alpdzw", "parent_id": "t1_efi9sla", "score": "1", "subreddit": "conlangs", "subreddit_id": "t5_2red7"}, {"author": "AvdaxNaviganti", "body": "I don't play this game, but I'm aware of the items in it.

It's rather a side effect of adapting light novels that they themselves publish, so some of its work falls on the artists in KyoAni itself.

These singles were released in April 28, 2010 under the name of Houkago Tea Time, and sold 81,000 and 74,000 copies respectively during their first charting week in May 10. GO! GO! MANIAC became the first single attributed to anime characters to top the Japanese Oricon Weekly Singles Chart, and together with Listen!!, which debuted at #2 during the same week, Houkago Tea Time became only the third female act to take the top two spots simultaneously on the chart. HTT was also the first to do that in 26 years, going back to \"eternal idol\" Seiko Matsuda in 1983.\n\nThat's as far as I've read about the matter whenever I chance upon it, so I wanted to do some more digging about this. I noted down that the first female act with two top spot singles was singer Keiko Fuji back in 1970. But I also found out that another such act had done the same feat after HTT did: idol group Nogizaka46 last year. All in all, only ten acts have achieved a 1-2 monopoly in this 50-year old chart. Four of these acts were completely female, and one of those four are our beloved keions. Who would've thought! Furthermore, HTT is also the only one of the four acts to do this with simultaneous releases.\n\nThe two top singles that gave these four acts that rare achievement are as follows:\n\n* 1970 - Keiko Fuji: \"Keiko no Yume wa Yoru Hiraku\" and \"Onna no Blues\"\n\n* 1983 - Seiko Matsuda: \"Hitomi wa Diamond\" and \"Glass no Ringo\"\n\n* 2010 - Houkago Tea Time: \"GO! GO! MANIAC\" and \"Listen!!\"\n\n* 2018 - Nogizaka46: \"Nigemizu\" and \"Itsuka Dekiru kara Kyou Dekiru\"\n\nSource:\n\n[EN] [Anime News Network: K-On!!

Until I started less than a week ago, my only regular KnK fix was its rousing opening theme. I wasn't very sure about starting the anime, however, until [this clip](https://old.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/9yhbgf/clip_love_you_kyoukai_no_kanata/) and [some others](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgVXD1ymSWQ) convinced me to pick it up. I'm up to episode 8 at the moment, and so far, I have had a great time with it. Slice of Life and Fantasy are two of my favorite genres, and K-On! and Little Witch Academia being my two top favorite anime at the moment shows that. KnK has that healthy balance between these genres as well as comedy that I'm on board with. As for Mirai, I can't help but think of how pathetic she was during the first few episodes (not meaning it maliciously, though), but she just breaks that image along the way and I can't take my eyes off it. Plus, Mirai has one of the cleanest attack grunts I've ever heard, and Risa Taneda's ability to handle this and her cuter moments elsewhere was impressive. I hope that KnK goes on this path going forward, and this might be on its way to become one of my top favorites as well.\n\nAlso, everytime Mirai wields her weapon or uses her ability, I get awful shivers. God damn.\n\nAs for **My Teen RomCom SNAFU** which I started weeks ago, I finished the first season. I did not finish the OVA, though, and am planning to start the second season at some point this week. So far, it's a mixed bag for me. On the one hand, the main characters themselves intrigue me so far, and Hachiman's zigzagging philosophy regarding the world around him was worth a watch. I also appreciated Yui's company, and Yukino's inner moments were quite adorable. However, the character relationships are somewhat hard to read, and I don't know where to place them in the context of the show.
