Someone before him had already [guessed](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hittite_language#Decipherment) that Hittite was an Indo-European language. Also the cuneiform writing system inherited some logograms from Sumerian that contained clues about meanings, a bit like Chinese. \n\nSo armed with this knowledge, Hrozn\u00fd made some [educated guesses](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bed%C5%99ich_Hrozn%C3%BD#Deciphering_of_the_Hittite_language):\n\n> It was known at that time that the ideogram for NINDA meant bread in Sumerian. Hrozn\u00fd thought that the suffix -an was perhaps the Hittite accusative. Then, he assumed that the second word, ed-/-ezza, had something to do with the bread and assumed that it could be the verb to eat. The comparison with the Latin edo, the English eat and the German essen led to the assumption that NINDA-an ezzatteni means \"you will eat bread\". In the second sentence, Hrozn\u00fd was struck by the word watar that has similarities to the English water and German Wasser. The last word of the second sentence, ekutteni, had the stem eku-, which seemed to resemble the Latin aqua (water). So, he translated the second sentence as \"you will drink water\".\n\nWhen he took these guesses and applied them elsewhere they made sense.

If you just have a healthy distrust of your own output and a desire to emulate those you hear, and you get enough input, and you can somehow keep your social anxiety down, you'll make progress. \n\nThe concepts I'm talking about come from a school of thought in second language acquisition most commonly associated with Stephen Krashen. You can download his book [Principles and Practice in Second Language Acquisition (Internet Edition)](http://sdkrashen.com/content/books/principles_and_practice.pdf), I highly recommend it to get an overview of his ideas. \n\nTwo of the fundamental ideas have been described more recently as follows:\n\n> \"The complex and abstract mental representation of language is mainly built up through implicit learning processes as learners attempt to comprehend messages directed to them in the language. Explicit learning plays a more minor role in the language acquisition process, contributing to metalinguistic knowledge rather than mental representation of language.\"\n>\n> \"The principal data for the acquisition of language is found in the communicatively embedded comprehensible input that learners receive.

Little kids often start out with bad pronunciation but it usually fixes itself over time. \n\nThere's no evidence that \"fossilization\" is inherently permanent. Sure many people stabilize at a certain level, but this seems to be because of either insufficient input or psychological affect. \n\nHere's how I think it can happen: Very often language learners will have some success at outputting artificially what they haven't acquired (implicitly learned) yet from input. They may be \"close enough\" to make themselves understood and even be praised for what they've achieved. But because they can't actually hear the difference between their output and native output yet, they treat their own output as accurate. The amount of work they've put in to getting this close can result in an emotional need to believe it's accurate. But when they do this their system accepts their own output as input and this gums up the system. \n\nI think you can use the affective filter to your advantage if you can bring yourself to apply it to your own output. For a very long time, I would say at least until C1, put up a mental block against your own output. Just assume you're getting it wrong. Sure, get out there and communicate, don't let it hold you back.

But to my mind the existence and continued success (albeit unsung) of ALG is Exhibit A in support of Krashen's core hypotheses. These were initially criticised but [they are still fundamental](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/352710658_Was_Krashen_right_Forty_years_later) to the field of second language acquisition.", "created_utc": "1663512881.0", "edited": "1663513595.0", "id": "ioxma8r", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_xgz9nh", "parent_id": "t1_ioxeiho", "score": "3", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "joelthomastr", "body": "I hope it helps!

But once they're communicating successfully their phonology is basically their accent, and accents are tied up with identity. So just getting more input usually won't cut it.\n\nBabies and children learn (or \"acquire\") language inductively from input. It's a bottom-up process driven by subconsciously recognizing repeating elements, intuiting patterns among those elements, and then generalizing those patterns to interpret and ultimately generate unique utterances.\n\nAdults still have this ability, in fact under the right conditions they're more efficient at it. But adults have at least two problems: Firstly, they usually don't have the access to the masses of input required, and secondly, even when they do, they usually want to be able to speak on day one. This leads them to use consciously memorized rules and vocabulary. This deductive, top-down approach (also known as explicit learning) is fundamentally different to the inductive, bottom-up system of child-like acquisition (also known as implicit learning).\n\nTop-down knowledge can be a good thing because it can jump-start communication, which leads to more input to fuel the bottom-up system. But it can be a bad thing for two reasons: Firstly, the explicit knowledge can skew the way the input is interpreted; the bottom-up pattern recognition system that would usually go with the flow of the \"territory\" is now being prejudiced by the \"map\" of conscious knowledge about what \"should\" be there. Secondly, when the adult sees that their communicative output has been understood and assumes that it is therefore correct, the subconscious system uses that as input.\n\nThis wreaks particular havoc on the sound system (phonology). For babies and children, the sound system is step one. In the beginning the \"music\" of the language (prosody) as well as statistical analysis helps them to recognize words. Then they get a sense for which sound variations matter and which don't. For example, with English they need to hear \"ship\" and \"sheep\" as completely different words but interpret, say, \"about\", \"aboat\" and \"aboot\" as the same word.\n\nAdults who speak on day one are completely bypassing this first stage of getting a feel for prosody and phonology. Often they approximate based on the sound system of their own language and just sail straight on.\n\nThis is one of the reasons why input-oriented language learning methods such as the Natural Approach and Automatic Language Growth advocate or at least suggest a \"silent period\", similar to children.\n\nBy way of example:\n\n>When a Thai student of English comes to the word, \u2018hospital\u2019 what happens? The sounds are changed from the English pronunciation, ho's-pi-tal, to the Thai pronunciation, hos-pi-to'n. The word is forced into the phonetic system of the Thai language. This is done with each and every new word.  \n>  \n>We now have a word that to the native English speaker, is unintelligible. Likewise, when the Thai person hears the native English speaker say hospital, he has no idea what is being said. Only when the word is deliberately mispronounced, is it understood. In order then to use English, the whole basis for nearly every incorrectly formed word must first be replaced with the correct pronunciation. This rarely if ever, happens, although this is the very thing makes up the majority of the time spent, trying to learn English. What is true with one word, is only compounded many times over with an entire language. A language is much more than simply putting words together in grammatical ways.  \n>  \n>[Why 'Speaking' is Harmful? (For students of the ALG Program)](https://view.officeapps.live.com/op/view.aspx?src=https%3A%2F%2Falgworld.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fjust_let_me_try.doc&wdOrigin=BROWSELINK)\n\nBased on my own experience and what I've seen in others, and also on what I've read about, once non-native phonology sets in it takes a lot of the right kind of motivation to correct it. Non-native variation in pronunciation isn't necessarily a problem for successful communication and, unlike with spelling and grammar, can even be \"close enough\" to be considered correct. Usually once an adult is communicating successfully they just don't have the motivation for additional input to take them further.\n\nEven if they do want to be native-like on some level, now that they are communicating they're perceived a certain way by the people they are communicating with. Their identity as a non-native is fixed in the minds of others. Even if they have had enough input to sound native, in practice it's likely they would feel self-conscious, a bit like how they would if they mimicked another accent in their native language. Ultimately it's the identity dimension of a native speaker's motivations that not only fuels \"perfect\" acquisition as children but also leads them to go along with shifts in their native language as adults.", "created_utc": "1663498034.0", "edited": "False", "id": "iowshes", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_xgz9nh", "parent_id": "t3_xgz9nh", "score": "5", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "joelthomastr", "body": "Lamont, of Days of French 'n' Swedish, did [a review of Speakly](https://youtu.be/lskd2DyW2qk).

Maybe it's because his research is focused on teaching language in a classroom setting. He's trying to tell teachers that even if they teach grammar really well, this will not help their students to acquire language. As a teaching strategy, making students produce self-generated comprehensible input makes no sense when it's your job to give them the comprehensible input they need. Also, forcing students to speak is damaging, because comprehensible input doesn't work when you're under stress. \n\nBut I think most of us here are trying to teach ourselves, so this phenomenon is far from trivial. \n\nFor example take [this video](https://youtu.be/Bue05mPPoFw) by Language Lords. He basically did what you said, he gave himself 240 hours of self-generated comprehensible input on top of whatever he had from before. I'm not surprised he's fluent! He also did a [follow-up video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hin1HGhbGdo) where he presents what he says is the most important method he uses, which is recording himself while forcing himself to tell a story, researching the words he struggled with and then memorizing them, and then telling the stories again. But you can see there's a problem with this when he talks to a native speaker, because he finds out his mistakes after he's acquired them.\n\nSo can this work? Well yeah kinda.

Also, forcing students to speak is damaging, because comprehensible input doesn't work when you're under stress. \n\nBut I think most of us here are trying to teach ourselves, so this phenomenon is far from trivial. \n\nFor example take [this video](https://youtu.be/Bue05mPPoFw) by Language Lords. Dude basically gave himself 240 hours of self generated comprehensible input on top of whatever he had from before. I'm not surprised he's fluent! He also did a [follow-up video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hin1HGhbGdo) where he presents what he says is the most important method he uses, which is recording himself while forcing himself to tell a story, researching the words he struggled with and then memorizing them, and then telling the stories again. But you can see there's a problem with this when he talks to a native speaker, because he finds out his mistakes after he's acquired them.\n\nSo can this work? Well yeah kinda. But if you have the option of getting input from native speakers why would you infect yourself with your own mistakes?", "created_utc": "1662293357.0", "edited": "False", "id": "in1mpsj", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_x5aotd", "parent_id": "t1_in1g3g5", "score": "3", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "joelthomastr", "body": "Couldn't have put it better", "created_utc": "1662268613.0", "edited": "False", "id": "in0qpw1", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_x58vwi", "parent_id": "t1_in0qf6j", "score": "9", "subreddit": "GetMotivated", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rmfx"}, {"author": "joelthomastr", "body": "Acquired language is nothing like learned language. \n\nLearned language is conscious knowledge you have to consciously dredge up to use. It's explicit knowledge. It's top down, applying abstract knowledge about language to real situations. \n\nAcquired language is like an intuition, a feeling, you can't explain why but it just sounds right. It's implicit knowledge.  It's bottom up, exposure to lots of real situations leading to pattern recognition.\n\nAcquired language is automatic too, it just works without you needing to think. It's almost spooky, a bit like a magic 8 ball. The person you're speaking with says some words and the 8 ball tells you what their thoughts are. You have some thoughts you want to express and the 8 ball gives you some words. \n\nThe 8 ball doesn't come from conscious study, because it's a fundamentally different way of knowing. It comes from lots of real world experiences of people communicating with you or with each other. When you have enough clues to \"comprehend\" what someone's thoughts are, your brain automatically searches for connections between those thoughts and the sounds they're making. In other words, it uses comprehensible input to gradually build the 8 ball. \n\nPracticing speaking makes sense when it's a question of getting good at using what the 8 ball gives you, like with your native language. \n\nBut if the 8 ball hasn't had enough input it's just going to come up blank. So then practicing speaking means \"calculating\" sentences based what you've memorized, or just floundering. \n\nYou need to focus on getting the input you need for your brain to build your 8 ball. Then when your 8 ball is giving you material to work with it makes sense to practice using it. \n\nIf what you've memorized is helping you to start those interactions and get input then great. But all the explicit knowledge in the world and all the practice at accessing it isn't going to turn into implicit knowledge, a bit like how you can't learn to ride a bike by studying about it.  \n\nBut what about what you say when you're communicating? It is true that your brain can use what comes out of your mouth towards building the 8 ball, especially if you kid yourself that it's correct just because people understand you or because you're emotionally invested in all the hard work you did to get it right.

Do you happen to know, by any chance?\n\nToday I accidentally re-discovered the concept of bootstrapping. Everything I said about trees and woods is basically that. \n\nWikipedia has a [fairly good entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootstrapping_(linguistics)). I think a much richer introduction is [Episode 55 of Tea With BVP](https://share.transistor.fm/s/c2ce64b6) which is dedicated to the subject (it's a radio show so the intro is fun fluff, the meat starts at 7:20).\n\n>I think that an awareness of a pattern can exist without an awareness of the items\n\nFor sure, but I would still hold to my position that the patterns never exist without the items that they exist between. \n\nI'm not proposing that our brain has an archive of all the times we ever heard each of the items in our brains. But what I am proposing is that each linguistic item (word, chunk, set phrase or what have you) is a rich object that bears the imprints of all the times that it was experienced. And that what we try to express in the form of grammar rules is not a kind of abstract system that the brain identifies and stores somewhere else, they are patterns that we intuit among the items.\n\nYour conscious awareness of the pattern might be as something abstract, but I propose that this awareness is like seeing the tip of an iceberg. Just because you can't see the rest of the iceberg under the water and it can seem reasonable to think of of the tip above the water as if it's some kind of independent island, it isn't. What's visible above the water depends on what happens to the rest of the iceberg under the water, and the first you're aware that things have changed is when the whole thing starts to roll before your eyes as if by magic. \n\nSimilarly, a reason I think that the patterns in language are never truly abstracted from the linguistic items that underpin them is because of how language change happens. The processes that built our language competence in the beginning continue to run throughout our lives if we let them, so that if the language around us starts to shift, our experiences of the new usages leave more and more imprints on the items in our subconscious until the whole pattern shifts. It's so automatic that our conscious minds are sometimes surprised.\n\nI hope I'm not talking past you here, maybe you've basically said the same thing and it's different definitions that are tripping us up. When you speak of \"patterns we have conscious awareness of\" I think the devil's in the detail. There's a difference between being aware of the existence of a pattern and attempting to explain or define it in words. As I just explained, I don't see any reason to think that simple awareness of the existence of a linguistic pattern constitutes an independent abstraction.

I guess I'm not 100% clear on what you mean. The only reading I'm finding myself able to conjure for this claim is that what actually gets stored in our brain are every single instance of every spoken sentence, rather than the abstracted patterns. But that seems really hard to believe, though?\n\nI think of it like this: When we learn a language naturally we are differentiating linguistic items, be they words, set phrases or other repeating fragments. These are like the trees. \n\nEach token we get of the item, together with the experience that it is embedded in, makes some kind of impression on our perception of the item so that it takes on a kind of richness, a unique character. While we may or may not forget the experiences themselves in the sense that we are unable to replay them in our minds, each one leaves its own nuanced impressions on the linguistic items in our subconscious mind, like pressing a detailed object into soft clay.\n\nThen we start to spot patterns between the items, a bit like thinking of a group of trees as forming a wood. \n\nYou wrote earlier: \n\n> They are stored/encoded without reference to the particular tokens from which we deduced them. And it is those abstracted rules that we have stored that allow us to create new tokens in the future.\n\nI'm seeing now that we need to make a distinction between spotting a pattern between items, and even extrapolating that pattern, on the one hand and deriving formal rules on the other. \n\nOne is like getting a joke and the other is like trying to explain why the joke is funny. When we spot a pattern it's a flash of inspiration, rather like the jolt we feel when we get a joke. It's not encoded in language, we know this because, as we all know, it's not funny when you have to explain it and sometimes it's actually very difficult to explain why it's funny. \n\nAnother important difference between patterns and rules is that the pattern cannot exist without the items but the point of a formal rule is to dispense with them. \n\nDeriving formal rules is something our conscious minds do, they are map not territory. We know this because the first thing we do with a rule is test it against our experiences and the patterns we have intuited from them. Our subconscious minds deal only in patterns, not in rules, and a pattern without the items is like a wood without trees.\n\nA line of introspective evidence for this is how we are never really perturbed by the irregularities in our mother tongue. When someone learning English as a second language points out to us that, say, the verb \"to be\" is crazy and really hard to learn (\"I am, you are, I was, you were\" instead of something regular like \"I say, you say, I said, you said\") we just go \"Huh, would you look at that\" and then just go about our daily lives. Our conscious knowledge of this weirdness makes no dent at all, when we hear someone say \"I be\" it still \"sounds\" just as wrong as it ever did. \n\nI can't point to any empirical evidence right now, but I can point you in the direction of second language acquisition researchers like Bill VanPatten. Maybe try [Tea With BVP, Episode 58, listen from approx. 10:00](https://share.transistor.fm/s/19f9c7bf). \n\n> And, as a bonus thought: maybe pragmatics is more fundamental to language than any other aspect of language is (e.g., phonology, morphology, syntax, or even semantics...).\n\nYes!

We do not need to have ever seen before, let alone memorized, a particular sentence to know how to parse it the first time we see it. We do not need to have ever heard a certain noun before to have a pretty strong guess as to how to pluralize it. Etc. These are all (ex hypothesi at least) acquired through statistical analysis, but they are stored/encoded without reference to the particular tokens from which we deduced them. And it is those abstracted rules that we have stored that allow us to create new tokens in the future.\n\nAlmost. The way I understand it is that we certainly identify patterns and extrapolate them but at least in our native languages our extrapolations are never more than a kind of \"working theory\" until they are confirmed, either when our new tokens are accepted by others or when we hear these tokens in the speech of others. In other words our subconscious model of the language remains bottom-up. I think it's only natural to suppose that these extrapolations can be \"stored/encoded without reference to the particular tokens from which we deduced them\" but in practice it might be like proposing that you can have a wood without trees.\n\n> In English there are rules detailing the formats for naming geological objects, and the rules must be memorized one by one, for each type of object.\n\nOnly if you're learning them consciously do you need to memorize them one by one. As native speakers we blithely go through our childhoods hearing about Lake This and Lake That and if we're ever in a situation where we need to talk about Lake X it just \"feels right\" to call it Lake X and not X Lake (because we extrapolate our model).\n\n> I can't imagine, though, but that there are some principles that inform all of this at least in part\u2014in other words, that it's not as arbitrary as basic vocabulary is. \n\nI think that's the idea behind universal grammar, right? I have no problem with innatism on a philosophical level, but I suspect that some of the bewilderment with how children can learn language so fast is because we're so wedded to the concept of a word that we might be missing something. Like, for example, could it be that babies actually start with sentence fragments and the process of working out where words begin and end automatically gives them the grammar too? But I digress...\n\n> For example, it would seem that more often than not the most straightforward way of saying something in a given language in a given context is also one that requires no more words than other options do? This is by no means a universal rule (very far from it), but it does seem to bear up more than chance, no?\n\nAbsolutely, and I think the constant pressure to say more with less, that comes in so many forms in our daily lives, is enough to account for this.

When we use an expression that isn't straightforward, this must be because we're saying something that isn't straightforward. \n\nSo in your example, the most straightforward way of saying that you're taking your dog to the vet is to say that you're taking your \"dog\" to the vet. The other options aren't straightforward, and therefore I would assume that if you used any of the other options you would be trying to communicate something that isn't so straightforward.\n\nIf you said you're taking your \"Dalmatian\" to the vet I would wonder if maybe you have another dog of a different breed and you're specifying which one. If you said you're taking your \"purebred Dalmatian\" to the vet I would think that maybe you're trying to impress me with the superior quality of your pet.\n\nSo what determines which way to say something is the most straightforward way?\n\n> It seems that the level of specificity that would be experienced as \"unmarked\" is dependent on something other than the objective facts or the speaker's intentions. Whether that something is something internal to the language itself, something related to the community but external to the language, or some combination of both these factors (along, perhaps, with some other things) is TBD for me right now.\n\nThe process of language acquisition seems to be something akin to statistical analysis, in other words a child continuously amasses a corpus of speech sounds embedded in experiences and its subconscious mind is continually searching for patterns in that corpus. The important point is that it's a bottom-up process where everything is defined by its place in an overall system. \n\nSo when we ask ourselves what's the most straightforward way to say something we don't reach for some kind of rule for the ideal level of specificity, we simply ask ourselves what feels normal. Talking about taking a dog to the vet feels just as normal as following a trail through the jungle instead of hacking through the undergrowth. Because it is like a trail in our minds worn by the feet of many thousands of experiences where we heard those words or words like them. \n\nGrice's maxim of quantity says:\n\n> Make your contribution as informative as is required for the current purposes of the exchange, but no more\n\nBut what does it mean to be informative?\n\n> The core idea of information theory is that the \"informational value\" of a communicated message depends on the degree to which the content of the message is surprising--[Entropy (information theory)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_(information_theory)), Wikipedia\n\nSo I would fuse all this and say that the most straightforward way to say something is the least informative way to say something because it is the least surprising way to say something, but in language something is surprising not with reference to an abstract principle but with reference to the more common alternatives among the set of possibilities.\n\nIt struck me that the other alternatives in your example, namely to speak of taking your \"domesticated mammal\" or your \"living being\" to the vet, sounded almost robotic. But of course they do, because that's the kind of mistake a robot would make if you just plugged Grice's maxims and a dictionary into it. It would be reasoning deductively from principles of how informative a statement \"should\" be with no feel for what's natural. In other words, all map and no territory.\n\n> When people correct each other in toki pona to be less specific, maybe what they are doing is they are pointing out to each other that they believe that the level of specificity that was just used is marked for that particular context in toki pona, either in the belief (1) that the person they are correcting does not realize this, or (2) that they must work to prevent a change in the pragmatics of the language/community that would be displeasing to them.\n\nI agree, but I would also suggest that being overly specific is a symptom of people using Toki Pona before they've acquired a corpus, so they're selecting words based on English equivalents rather than based on how they relate to the other words in the set of Toki Pona vocabulary. When you start to see the world as framed by Toki Pona and you can think and communicate directly in Toki Pona, Grice's maxims kick in and it all fixes itself.", "created_utc": "1651237337.0", "edited": "False", "id": "i6nt34c", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_ua5s7i", "parent_id": "t1_i6krtdg", "score": "2", "subreddit": "tokipona", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s5z5"}, {"author": "joelthomastr", "body": "Very good.

Can you tell me if I'm on the right track?\n\nI think I understand what he's getting at from the top down, in the context of his overall classification scheme. The idea is basically that if a phraseme doesn't contain the semantic pivot that's how you know it's an idiom and not a collocation. But when I try to work it out from the bottom up I'm getting confused because the definition of a semantic pivot refers to a predicate but a lot of the examples are actually noun phrases. \n\nHere is the clearest definition of his that I could find:\n\n> Let there be a meaning 'S' that can be divided in two parts 'A' and 'B' so that 'S' = 'A' \u2295 'B'. The meaning 'A' is called the semantic pivot of the meaning 'S' = 'A' \u2295 'B' iff 'B'('A'). ... The part 'B' of the meaning 'S' is a predicate (or a configuration of predicates) having 'A' as its argument ([2015](https://books.google.com.tr/books?id=VzFGBgAAQBAJ&pg=PA305&dq=%22semantic+pivot%22&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiKyOLwi7D3AhWPQ_EDHarEA_0Q6AF6BAgIEAI#v=onepage&q=%22semantic%20pivot%22&f=false))\n\nDavid Beck ([2019](https://journals.lib.unb.ca/index.php/la/article/view/29637)) reproduces an earlier definition of Mel\u2019\u010duk's from 2006:\n\n> For an expression AB having the meaning \u2018S\u2019 such that \u2018S\u2019 = \u2018S1\u2019 \u2295 \u2018S2\u2019, the semantic pivot of \u2018AB\u2019 is that part \u2018S1\u2019 of AB\u2019s meaning \u2018S\u2019 such that \u2018S\u2019 [= \u2018S1\u2019 \u2295 \u2018S2\u2019] can be represented as a predicate \u2018S2\u2019 bearing on \u2018S1\u2019, i.e., \u2018S\u2019 = \u2018S2\u2019(\u2018S1\u2019)\n\nBut then Beck adds this:\n\n> In the examples above, the semantic pivot is given in small caps in the definition and, informally, represents the basic type to which the referent of the idiom belongs. Thus, a \u02f9lightning rod\u02fa is a type of device, a \u02f9sea dog\u02fa is a kind of person, and \u02f9shoot the breeze\u02fa is a type of chatting.\n\nSo take \"lightning rod\", that's a noun phrase. The paraphrase given is \"device that is designed to protect constructions against lightning and has the form of a conducting rod.\" It's intuitive to me that \"device\" is the semantic pivot, but it's the head of a noun phrase. Since when do noun phrases contain predicates? \n\nUnless we're saying the head-dependent relationship in a noun phrase is basically analogous to the argument-predicate relationship in a sentence. I thought maybe Mel\u2019\u010duk was proposing a general principle that would allow for this but his 2015 definition is really doubling down with the \"iff\" and so on.

But after rereading some of what you and others have written in this thread I would like to flesh out some of the implications. I'll include some helpful explanations for others who may be reading this. \n\nOnce again, thanks for the soapbox. I'm talking to myself as much as anyone else, this is the first time I've actually been able to get these thoughts together in writing. So thanks! \n\nAs I think you know, I'm very much enamored of the innatist Input Hypothesis as proposed by Krashen. But leaving that to one side, I think we can all recognize the difference between the speech that comes naturally to us and our conscious intervention in our own speech. If you're a behaviorist/cognitivist you might think of language mastery as simply internalization and \"force of habit\", but for the purposes of this discussion that will also do. ([This seems like a nice little primer on the innatism/behaviorism contrast](https://socialscienceresearch.org/index.php/GJHSS/article/view/3050) if anyone finds that interesting.) \n\nSo that's one axis: What comes naturally to us as opposed to our conscious calculation or intervention. I'll call this the subconscious-conscious axis. \n\nThis distinction applies when we use language. When we talk _about_ language this turns into a descriptive-prescriptive axis. In other words, statements about how something is in a language are of two kinds. They either refer to how people \"subconsciously\" use the language \"in the wild\" or they explain some kind of rule about what the language is supposed to be, implying that we should all \"consciously\" intervene in our own speech to enforce these rules  ([good luck with that](https://youtu.be/m_MaJDK3VNE)).\n\nThe second axis that you touched on in your original post was the [syntax-semantics-pragmatics](http://www.wu.ece.ufl.edu/books/philosophy/language.html) axis. To oversimplify: Syntax tells you about the grammar mistakes in your sentence, semantics tells you what your sentence means out of context, and pragmatics tells you what your sentence could mean in a variety of contexts. (It's worth pointing out that these distinctions are also definitely map, not territory.)\n\nThe most important point I want to make is that all linguistic behavior is \"subconscious\" by default and this includes pragmatics. When I say \"Can you pass the salt?\" you automatically understand that I'm not asking you about what you can and can't do, I'm telling you I want you to give me the salt.\n\nThis is why you can study grammar books and memorize dictionaries all you want, you not only end up with an incomplete and sometimes-accurate map, what's more that map will only cover the syntax (grammar) and semantics (vocabulary).\n\nI think this is helpful for analyzing what's going on with Toki Pona. Lipu pu crystallized a set of conscious rules for syntax and semantics only. The pragmatics was left to emerge naturally, a bit like how there might be no fire escape on the building plans but there's really only one place it can go and so that's where we all put it. \n\nSo when I apply this two dimensional framework to some of your statements this is what I get:\n\n> Some of the rules are\u00a0descriptive rules of grammar: e.g., modifiers always follow the word or phrase they are modifying...\n\nA conlang by definition has to at least start out as a prescriptivist enterprise unless it's a conpidgin. Even though we have a lot of fluent speakers, everybody who learns has to learn through explicit grammar rules, there simply isn't enough comprehensible input around. Sure, when we get a corpus of established convention we can start to call it descriptive. \n\n> Others of the rules are prescriptive rules of culture:...\n\nThe distinction you're making is along the syntax-semantics-pragmatics axis, not the descriptive-prescriptive axis. \n\n> e.g., politeness is implied and need not be made explicit\n\nWhen somebody comes along and says \"There's no fire escape on these building plans, where do I put it?\" and we say \"Just put it wherever, look you can put it here, everybody else does\" is that really prescriptivism? It's a consequence of the map not extending into pragmatic territory and allowing it to emerge naturally. Some of us just get out there and pick it up subconsciously, others feel uncomfortable without a map so we draw some extra lines for them on the one they've got to give them the confidence they need to get out there. \n\n> communicate only what is necessary and leave out what is extraneous\n\nThat's straight out of Grice's paradigms, which are basically like the pragmatics laws of physics. That happens all by itself when the language is mastered and used naturally, or \"subconsciously\".\n\n> when referring to a place name, use the main name used in the language spoken by the majority of the population of that place;\n\nActually, this is no different to the syntax or semantic rules in that it starts out as prescriptive and when it becomes an established convention it's descriptive. \n\n> do not lexicalize\n\nThis is a fascinating one because it's obviously a prescriptive rule and I dearly hope that it can be realised in \"subconscious\" usage without the need for conscious, prescriptive maintenance. We already have a lot going for us in that  Toki Pona is radically [analytic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytic_language), which prevents [derivation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphological_derivation), and the closed vocabulary means that even though [phrasemes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phraseme) are inevitable their [collocations](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collocation) will hopefully never be strong enough to divorce them from their semantic meaning. \n\nI mean this: Idioms happen because there are so many ways of saying the same thing semantically that certain options start to take on a specific pragmatic role; the limited vocabulary of Toki Pona means that there are less ways of saying the same thing semantically to start with and so there is less potential for this. So even though \"jan pona\" can have the default meaning of \"friend\" because of collocation, the fact that there is no other way to say \"good person\" means that our subconscious will never forget that \"jan pona\" is made of two words, and that collocation will never be strong enough to destroy that compositional nature of it.", "created_utc": "1650787522.0", "edited": "1650829952.0", "id": "i5z7bhx", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_ua5s7i", "parent_id": "t1_i5y96jx", "score": "2", "subreddit": "tokipona", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s5z5"}, {"author": "joelthomastr", "body": "sina pilin pona la mi pona. toki sina li pona wawa, li pana e toki insa sin tawa mi. pona tawa sina!", "created_utc": "1650776816.0", "edited": "False", "id": "i5ysxcp", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_ua5s7i", "parent_id": "t1_i5y96jx", "score": "2", "subreddit": "tokipona", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s5z5"}, {"author": "joelthomastr", "body": "I think it's time to break out the map-territory analogy. \n\nFor natural languages, the language itself as spoken by people without any conscious effort is the territory, and formal grammar is the map. \n\nIt's a common misconception that when you learn the grammar of a language as an explicit set of rules you are learning the language. You are not, you are putting together a map. When you encounter the language in real life, that's like actually going to the territory. In the beginning your map might help you to find your way around, but once you've lived in the territory for long enough you won't need it. Because your subconscious mental representation of the territory (which is nothing like the map, by the way) is now complete.\n\nA conlang by definition is a map without a territory. It's when people start acquiring it and using it subconsciously that a territory starts to take shape. \n\nWhen the formal grammar of a natural language is found not to reflect the way the language is actually used, interesting things happen. Prescriptivists insist that the map is correct and that the discrepancies in the territory are wrong or don't count. Descriptivists might try to revise the formal grammar to better fit what is actually observed. \n\nBut what happens when a conlang, which started out as an imaginary map, ends up giving rise to a territory which then decides to go its own way?", "created_utc": "1650735138.0", "edited": "False", "id": "i5wfcl5", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_ua5s7i", "parent_id": "t3_ua5s7i", "score": "5", "subreddit": "tokipona", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s5z5"}, {"author": "joelthomastr", "body": "Thanks for the Khachaturian tip!

In the beginning having some formal rules helps to \"calculate\" meaningful sentences so that we can start communicating. \n\nBut now that our brains have acquired those initial forms, if we continue to use them intuitively for communication the language should take on a life of its own and expand organically. \"Discussing how things _should_ work\" puts a brake on that natural process, because we're stopping ourselves all the time to measure what's coming to us naturally against the \"official\" rules. It's an uneasy tension between a prescriptivist mindset of what we think an elegant grammar would look like and a descriptivist mindset that just enjoys the rush of natural acquisition and watching order emerge from the chaos of communication.\n\nMy suggestion would be to take the natural track. Keep what we already have in the quick-ref channel, but treat it as a primer rather than \"the law\". From here on out implement Viossa rules (no translation, no prescriptivism aka if people understand you that means it's correct).

I felt like I'd been lied to. \n\nIt's about as misleading as talking about \"the laws of physics\". Sure, we have _theories_ of physics that check out almost all of the time. But just as Newton couldn't explain the motion of Mercury, the day may well come when Einstein's theory fails to explain what we actually see and we need some new theories. We don't actually know \"the laws of physics\" because we don't have access to the source code of the universe.\n\nEqually we don't have access to the source code of our subconscious minds. We know what to give our minds for them to acquire language but, to paraphrase Arthur C. Clarke, it might as well be magic for all we know about how the hardware works.

After you tap K you get [this](https://i.ibb.co/gdf3yLY/inputk.png), and then you tap the \"kepeken\" key to get kepeken. Then you get back to the [main screen](https://i.ibb.co/JrcZgH3/inputmain.png) and then let's say you tap A, you get [this](https://i.ibb.co/Qv1ybbR/inputa.png) and so on.

There's no shame in using the Latin alphabet if it's more practical, I mean, look at Pinyin.\n\nThe Chinese writing system has nothing to do with the Latin alphabet, nevertheless commonly used [input methods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_input_methods_for_computers) in mainland China are based on Pinyin, [like this](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d9/Interface_of_Weasel_Input_Method.png). Sure there are shape-based input methods but the phonetic ones are the easiest to pick up and seem to be more commonly used. And that's in spite of the fact that many characters in Chinese have identical pronunciations and yet there's a lot of regional variations in pronunciation. We don't have either of those difficulties in Toki Pona.\n\nSo although I recognize the appeal of having an \"independent\" input method I really think it's overwhelmingly more practical to have a Latin-based one. Honestly I could use an efficient input method for either sitelen pona or Latin. But there's a place for shape-based input methods too, so to each their own :)", "created_utc": "1648653845.0", "edited": "False", "id": "i2q46mj", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_trtfvq", "parent_id": "t1_i2pwhsd", "score": "1", "subreddit": "tokipona", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s5z5"}, {"author": "joelthomastr", "body": "For me designing a keyboard is like designing a knife and fork. Do you want it to be pretty, or do you want people to actually use it? Don't get me wrong, I like the look of pretty cutlery. But I don't use them.\n\nI'm looking for something efficient. There are so few words that in principle it should be possible to input any word with only two taps/keypresses or a single swipe. I don't care so much about aesthetics. So for example, a keyboard that arranges sitelen pona by shape similarity instead of Latin alphabetical order might have some elegance on a conceptual level but it would be far too much work to memorize. There's no shame in using the Latin alphabet if it's more practical, I mean, look at Pinyin.\n\nThe way I imagine implementing it is to first press the first sound of the letter, so for example for kepeken you press K. But it doesn't input yet, what happens is all the keys now change to show all the K words in alphabetical order. (The K key itself is blank.) So for example A is now kala, E is kalama and so on. When you press kepeken it inputs kepeken. If you like you can swipe from K to kepeken. In other words all the letter keys are dead keys that wait for the second key press. \n\n[This is the closest I came](https://www.reddit.com/r/tokipona/comments/r6nu43/efficient_keyboard_idea_the_video_shows_the_steps/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) but it's not great because you have to tap and hold for the second level and the second level keys can change position.   I was also limited by the number of second keys available to a first level key, so it's an unholy compromise. \n\nThe last keyboard you mention comes closest to this, but it's not as efficient as it could be. The swipe functionality is used to connect compound words, I think it's a waste. Sometimes you hit the same key twice for a word, which would hamper the swipe functionality I'm talking about. Also there are some words that take three keypresses because some words share the same first two letters. But if you just arrange by alphabetical order in the second level there's actually enough space for all of them.", "created_utc": "1648615182.0", "edited": "1648620989.0", "id": "i2oegu7", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_trtfvq", "parent_id": "t3_trtfvq", "score": "1", "subreddit": "tokipona", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s5z5"}, {"author": "joelthomastr", "body": "[Focus on understanding not speaking](https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxbIike_IZrhWstMtAjWlDQMb1isYZEpJs)", "created_utc": "1648497066.0", "edited": "False", "id": "i2h78ip", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_tpvr7w", "parent_id": "t3_tpvr7w", "score": "1", "subreddit": "tokipona", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s5z5"}, {"author": "joelthomastr", "body": "For me the minimalism of Toki Pona makes it a wonderful playground for exploring everything from information theory to second language acquisition", "created_utc": "1648496374.0", "edited": "False", "id": "i2h5jl7", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_tqfarb", "parent_id": "t3_tqfarb", "score": "7", "subreddit": "tokipona", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s5z5"}, {"author": "joelthomastr", "body": "I nevvver saw the selo and sijelo connections, nice!", "created_utc": "1648405655.0", "edited": "False", "id": "i2ccgl4", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_tp3kt3", "parent_id": "t1_i28pp0x", "score": "3", "subreddit": "tokipona", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s5z5"}, {"author": "joelthomastr", "body": "Hi!

Others have made some great suggestions already, this is just to hopefully share some helpful ideas about translation in general. \n\nFirst things first: Context!\n\n[The scene from the movie](https://youtu.be/GQ5ICXMC4xY)\n\n> \"Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn\" is a line from the 1939 film\u00a0Gone with the Wind\u00a0starring\u00a0Clark Gable\u00a0and\u00a0Vivien Leigh. The line is spoken by\u00a0Rhett Butler\u00a0(Gable), as his last words to\u00a0Scarlett O'Hara\u00a0(Leigh), in response to her tearful question: \"Where shall I go? What shall I do?\" Scarlett clings to the hope that she can win him back. ... \n>\n> The line demonstrates that Rhett has finally given up on Scarlett and their tumultuous relationship. After more than a decade of fruitlessly seeking her love, he no longer cares what happens to her, even though she has finally admitted that she really loves him. ...\n>\n> Prior to the film's release, censors objected to the use of the word \"damn\" in the film, a word that had been prohibited by the 1930\u00a0Motion Picture Production Code, beginning in July 1934.\u2014[Wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankly,_my_dear,_I_don%27t_give_a_damn)\n\nSo what's going through Rhett's head as he says the line? He's a gentleman, but he just can't hide the outrage. The first half of the sentence would be a normal way for him to address her if they were still close, but then he uses a shocking phrase to give her a slap in the face. The reason the phrase is so iconic is because of that contradiction, and having \"my dear\" in there makes it sting even more. \n\nWhat would Rhett have said if he had been speaking Toki Pona? \n\nWe don't really have [terms of endearment](https://www.fluentin3months.com/terms-of-endearment/) in Toki Pona that are established in the same way as in English. For example \"baby\" and \"infant\" mean the same thing but you can't call your girlfriend \"infant\" because it's not an established term of endearment. You can use \"jan pona\" _as_ a term of endearment but it's not _established_ in the same way. In other words you wouldn't say \"jan pona o\" habitually, you would only say it if you really meant it. \n\nBut how are we going to create the delicious contradiction?\n\nMaybe let's start from the second half and work backwards.  \n\nScarlett says \"Where shall I go? What shall I do?\" Maybe \"sina tawa la mi tawa seme? mi pali e seme?\" No need for too much analysis here, we just need something in Toki Pona to get the juices flowing. \n\nNow what might Rhett say? I find it helps to brainstorm/ramble like this and then trim later. Maybe something like, \"pilin mi li pakala tan sina, ni la sina pilin pona anu ike la mi pilin sama. tenpo pini la pilin sina li suli tawa mi. taso pilin mi li suli ala tawa sina. ni la mi pini e pilin mi tawa sina. sina tawa pona anu ike la ale li sama tawa mi. mi la sina ken pakala.\"\n\nThe trimmed version of this should probably include a \"pakala\" for the shock effect. Probably some variation of the last bit will work.\n\nComing back to the term of endearment thing. We don't have them, everything is taken literally in Toki Pona. But he's got to say something that sounds nice to start and I can't think of anything that works other than \"jan pona\". If we were to translate the whole movie we'd have \"my dears\" all over the place and we would have to have something. \"jan olin\" is too strong, after all my grandma calls me this. So jan pona it is then. \n\njan pona o, mi la sina ken pona anu pakala, ale li sama\n\njan pona o, pona anu pakala la ale li sama tawa mi\n\njan pona o, sina ken pona anu pakala, mi la ale li sama\n\njan pona o, mi la sina ken pona anu pakala\n\n... and so on, after this point it's more a matter of taste than anything.

Gordon had visited the tribe with Everett in the early nineties, after Everett told him about the Pirah\u00e3\u2019s limited \u201cone,\u201d \u201ctwo,\u201d and \u201cmany\u201d counting system. Other tribes, in Australia, the South Sea Islands, Africa, and the Amazon, have a \u201cone-two-many\u201d numerical system, but with an important difference: they are able to learn to count in another language. The Pirah\u00e3 have never been able to do this, despite concerted efforts by the Everetts to teach them to count to ten in Portuguese.\n>\n>\n> During a two-month stay with the Pirah\u00e3 in 1992, Gordon ran several experiments with tribe members. In one, he sat across from a Pirah\u00e3 subject and placed in front of himself an array of objects\u2014nuts, aa batteries\u2014and had the Pirah\u00e3 match the array. The Pirah\u00e3 could perform the task accurately when the array consisted of two or three items, but their performance with larger groupings was, Gordon later wrote, \u201cremarkably poor.\u201d Gordon also showed subjects nuts, placed them in a can, and withdrew them one at a time. Each time he removed a nut, he asked the subject whether there were any left in the can. The Pirah\u00e3 answered correctly only with quantities of three or fewer. Through these and other tests, Gordon concluded that Everett was right: the people could not perform tasks involving quantities greater than three. Gordon ruled out mass retardation. Though the Pirah\u00e3 do not allow marriage outside their tribe, they have long kept their gene pool refreshed by permitting women to sleep with outsiders. \u201cBesides,\u201d Gordon said, \u201cif there was some kind of Appalachian inbreeding or retardation going on, you\u2019d see it in hairlines, facial features, motor ability.

Creolists often postulate that one prominent exceptional/abnormal process in the history of a Creole is the elimination of (virtually) all morphology from the output of pidginization (see Bickerton, 1984; Hjelmslev, 1938; Jespersen, 1922; McWhorter, 1998; Seuren, 1998; Seuren & Wekker, 1986). Pidgins, in other words, are structurally impoverished languages without any morphology, so the subsequent Creoles had to\ncreate their morphological apparatus _ab ovo_.\n\nThey go on to provide data to show that there is no 'break in transmission', between French and Haitian Creole.\n\nFrom page 136:\n\n> These patterns in Haitian Creole history do not instantiate any sort of \u2018discontinuity\u2019 that would set \u2018creolization\u2019 apart from other instances of language development/change over time. There is no rigorous algorithm that can reliably measure the structural discontinuity that is to serve as a litmus test for distinguishing the history of Creoles from the history of non-Creoles. The above data thus dismantle the exceptionalist claim that the kind of discontinuity manifested in Creole genesis is of a significantly distinct nature in comparison to the kind of discontinuities manifested in the history of so-called \u2018normal\u2019 or \u2018genetic\u2019 languages. The above-mentioned discontinuities in the history of English seem as spectacular as, or perhaps even more spectacular than, those in the history of Haitian Creole.\n\nIn other words, if there's anything special about Haitian Creole that makes it a creole then English is a creole too.

Memorization techniques and studying grammar are temporary crutches at best. It's only when you use your new word or your new construction to actually get your thoughts into someone else's brain that the dry knowledge is converted into a learned skill.\n\nThe instant I saw jan Misali's video about Viossa, I saw a connection and it gave me new inspiration.

Maybe some kind of atomist religion that teaches that the path to holiness lies in eliminating unnecessary words from your vocabulary, by using combinations of simpler words instead.
