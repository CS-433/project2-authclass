[{"author": "dkl_prolog", "body": "It's late and I keep trying to write this in a more useful way but the basic problem here is that Prolog programmers in your situation would go directly to DCGs rather than splitting strings or using regular expressions. The reason is that DCGs let you build up pretty complex parsers from nothing, and you quickly arrive at a natural Prolog structure for your AST that's easy to inspect and evaluate. This is part of what makes Prolog a different paradigm from other systems. It's quite obvious that you're trying to deal with an arithmetic expression evaluation of some kind. Asking how to split strings sort of gives away that you've got a certain approach in mind that isn't very native to Prolog, and you're trying to translate that approach. What would you do if you had the strings already split?\n\nI went through this exact pain myself about 15 years ago, by the way.", "created_utc": "1666931198.0", "edited": "False", "id": "iu30wql", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_yf9f8l", "parent_id": "t3_yf9f8l", "score": "3", "subreddit": "prolog", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhvg"}, {"author": "dkl_prolog", "body": "First off, `Y is X` suggests to me that you think `is/2` is a synonym for `=/2`. The purpose of `is/2` is to take an arithmetic expression on the right and evaluate it, and bind the value to the name on the left, so basically `X is 2*3+4` will unify `X = 10`. Meanwhile, `X = 2*3+4` will give you back `X = 2*3+4`. Since there is no expression here, just X, you can just say `X = Y`. This won't turn out to be necessary in the solution.\n\nYour base case of `rangeFifty([], []).` is correct. You then have a special treatment for one-element lists. Most of the time, a list processing predicate is going to have a base case like `[]` and an inductive case like `[H|T]`, and that's a good way of approaching this problem, especially as a beginner. So we wind up needing two inductive cases, one where `H` is in the range and one where it isn't:\n\n    rangeFifty([H|Unfiltered], [H|Filtered]) :- \n        between(50, 100, H), \n        rangeFifty(Unfiltered, Filtered).\n\nThis is not enough because now we need to handle the case where the head value isn't in the range:\n\n    rangeFifty([H|Unfiltered], Filtered) :-\n        \\+ between(50, 100, H),\n        rangeFifty(Unfiltered, Filtered).\n\nYou can also handle this with just one inductive case using the if/else operator, but I think it obscures the logic a bit. It does have the benefit of not making you try `between/3` twice though, and it doesn't leave a choice point on the stack:\n\n     rangeFifty([H|Unfiltered], Result) :-\n         rangeFifty(Unfiltered, Filtered),\n         (    between(50, 100, H) ->\n              Result = [H|Filtered]\n         ;    Result = Filtered\n         ).", "created_utc": "1666929959.0", "edited": "False", "id": "iu2ytxd", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_yf7yhk", "parent_id": "t3_yf7yhk", "score": "2", "subreddit": "prolog", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhvg"}, {"author": "dkl_prolog", "body": "Excellent song.

I live near Navajo people and run into them at Wal-mart and around town. I thought it might be a positive thing to know some greetings. At one time I had larger aspirations. I do think they understand the land a lot better than we do, so I'm interested in what I could learn from the Navajo about our flora and fauna. Not medicine, just food and other resources.\n\nI found several apps that had like recordings of words. Two or three textbooks\u2014I got _Conversational Navajo_ and there is another one that is supposed to be quite good, _Din\u00e9 Bizaad_. I also developed a local friend who I would meet with sometimes and rehearse a few phrases. Language teaching isn't really something she is interested in, so it sort of fell off pretty quickly.\n\nHonestly, I don't think the resources I was able to find would be sufficient for me to attain the level I want. Since I kind of gave up on Navajo I have made much more progress learning a different language that has a plethora of resources: podcasts, a Pimsleur course, the apps Glossika, LingQ and Clozemaster, and of course actual language tutors who are fluent in both and interested in teaching languages. If I had had all of these resources available in Navajo, I have no doubt I could have reached a similar level (although it still would have taken more time I think). \n\nOf all this, I think the most important resource is actually language tutors. If you go to iTalki, there are no Navajo tutors. There aren't any people volunteering to teach it here either. There are dozens of Youtubers for the other language I'm learning; there's only one for Navajo. Some of this is just the fact that Navajo has a much smaller base of speakers, fewer resources in general, etc. Some of it is that the resources for teaching Navajo are mainly directed at the Navajo themselves. Most European languages have a sort of \"wide open door\" for learners. I don't feel that there is much excitement amongst Navajo about Navajo language learners compared to European languages. That may sound lame but there are lots of hard days when you learn a language and it helps to have some positive feedback. On the other hand, a lot of indigenous language communities are sort of actively disinterested in outsiders learning their language, and that isn't the case with Navajo, so it could be much worse.\n\nIf I got my first wish for tutors, my second wish would be for a Pimsleur course. Pimsleur doesn't get you very far into A1 territory, but it helps hugely with helping you to develop your sound system for the language. My third wish would be for LingQ, because I think you need a big corpus of things to read at all levels to develop your skill. I'm not entirely sure whether there even exists a large corpus of written Navajo, let alone at various levels. This may just be my ignorance. But if it is out there and could be studied via that platform, that would be a huge benefit too. I think it's unlikely to work out of the box because it relies significantly on Google Translate, which doesn't support Navajo. Probably for the same reason.\n\nHow determined am I? Not particularly, as it turns out. I spent several months struggling with the resources I was able to round up and meeting with this friend sporadically. I learned how to pronounce a few things borderline correctly. I think if I had attachments to more Din\u00e9 people it would greatly increase my motivation. My main motivation was to be a good neighbor. I have sort of decided that the best way for me to do that is include Navajo people in my thoughts and conversations, be warm and accepting to ones I meet and friendly and helpful whenever the occasion presents itself.

However, the article about the disagreement between TLC and the Lakota shows that this does not appear to be the perspective of, if not all, at least a substantial number of the people of the tribe.\n\nI don't know whether the tribes have or even can have their own intellectual property law. But at least culturally, they seem to have some expectation there.\n\nThe government grant programs you mentioned were an aspect of this disagreement. It seems that the members of the tribe expected that printing costs would be covered by that. So in that particular case, some of the dispute may have been more about mundane concerns about how the money was spent.\n\n> That\u2019s where we disagree, indigenous ppl could have done all of this themselves but have refused. Which is why their languages are dying. \n\n\"Refused\" is kind of a strong verb. It's not like documenting a language is something that happens by accident unless you stop it.\n\nAt the Navajo reservation near me, about half the people have no running water or electricity. They may have more pressing issues than documenting their language. They may not have a lot of kids going to college. They may not have a lot of kids going to college specifically to study linguistics. \n\nNavajo may not be the best example because the language is so well-documented. But for a lot of these dying languages, the grandparents who speak it don't trust the friendly strangers knocking on the door to try and document it. Boarding schools and language repression are within living memory for these people.\n\nLanguages don't die because people fail to document them. They die when they become less useful than some other language. No amount of documentation is really going to be enough to prevent most native languages from disappearing. Documentation can help a language come back, in a way, like we've seen with the Eyak, but I wouldn't assume that every indigenous person would prefer their language to become a dusty book in an American museum in the hopes that some future descendants will care enough to learn it. Unless non-English native communities somehow become economically viable, the languages are likely to die out.

In Haskell, you just have to do everything differently, and it eventually becomes convenient to you. Cosplaying Haskell in Javascript isn't going to give you real FP benefits because you're completely trapped in this highly stateful environment where most everything you want to do is already a side effect.\n\nThe author is trying to create a purely functional environment inside Javascript. So they are making a big noise about how they will never actually evaluate anything which could cause side effects, instead some library function is going to do it later on. In Javascript this is additional work and it requires you to not accidentally create side effects.\n\nThe situation in Haskell is one in which you simply cannot create side effects without using the IO monad. You don't have to promise not to do anything or explicitly delay anything. So you do not have to think of yourself as assembling delayed impure functions, because that's not really what you're doing. You're instead composing monadic functions. Tutorials often call these \"IO actions\" initially and then later on show you the truth. (Ways around the IO monad also exist but these are usually not even touched upon in the beginner tutorials, and they are not commonly employed anyway). If you follow the rigors sufficiently, this Javascript version should give you a sort of simulacrum of doing pure FP, because in some sense the composition of monadic actions is a kind of delay.\n\nI personally think you'd get more out of a Haskell tutorial.", "created_utc": "1663961015.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ipmq23w", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_xlyo5f", "parent_id": "t1_ipmftik", "score": "2", "subreddit": "functionalprogramming", "subreddit_id": "t5_2vcmg"}, {"author": "dkl_prolog", "body": "Delaying the call of an impure function does not make it pure.\n\nI'm going to assume this misunderstanding has something to do with Haskell.

It works because atoms heavier than a certain amount want to decay, and when they decay, they release particles and heat. If the same kind of atoms absorb these particles, they will in turn decay.\n- You can control the reaction by putting not-so-heavy atoms in between the heavy atoms. These will absorb some of the particles without releasing more (which accelerates the reaction)\n- Some things are good at reflecting radiation\n- Water is good at absorbing heat, until it turns to steam, which is not. Steam takes up way more space (creates more pressure) than water does.\n- What element you get when a heavy element decays is a matter of probability. If the fuel is old, you know less about what is in it than when it was fresh (because when it was fresh, it was highly refined, and now it has decayed into lots of different things).", "created_utc": "1662073536.0", "edited": "False", "id": "imq4cr6", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_x2wx0j", "parent_id": "t1_impu1cg", "score": "1", "subreddit": "chernobyl", "subreddit_id": "t5_2twgu"}, {"author": "dkl_prolog", "body": ">Like when I watched the HBO series I didn\u2019t understand the science but I got the gist of \u201cthe design was flawed\u201d.

It also isn't the best at handling things that do not look like context-free grammars (or do not have strong ordering requirements), such as handling highly inflected languages. Since in music notation, I wouldn't think there would be a strict ordering in how, say, chords are represented as a stack of note, I worry about this. There are tricks to improve DCGs for various domains but ultimately, it winds up being somewhat of a let-down. In my experience. Although great for proof-of-concept and internal tools, again, IMO.\n\nI don't know a ton about music notation, but I do believe it is not especially regular. The basics, like whole, half, quarter notes etc. are fairly reliable, but you often have things you want to say about certain instruments that there aren't exactly notations for, and it winds up being attached as text or doodles in the margins. It's way more free-form than I expected, anyway. I would want to constrain the domain. You might say, it can parse things that have these features.\n\nI had, at one time, a book called _Intelligent Image Processing in Prolog_. The book was very 1980s; it had a bit about dealing with playing cards by looking for \"features\" (like concavities: a heart has one where the lobes meet, a club has four, a spade has two, and a diamond has zero) which was interesting but overall I got the sense it was a lot of trickery. I'm not aware of any modern-day applications in Prolog that do image processing, but I'm not the most plugged-in for that kind of thing. My sense is that the approaches taken in that book are old and unfashionable now, and that computer vision has come a long way. I could be wrong.\n\nI also love the bidirectionality of Prolog. But my sense is that it mainly works when you have a true bijection. That's not what you have if there is loss of information going from one side to the other, and there certainly would be loss of information going from image to notation and back. This doesn't mean you can't share much code. In your repo, you point out that there may be performance ramifications. So, you know, it's a consideration. I never tried to do anything half this ambitious in Prolog. I imagine as you get further into it, you'll encounter problems I've never seen and hopefully create solutions that I someday will require.\n\nI would be sure and raise this on the [SWI Prolog discourse](http://swi-prolog.discourse.group/), you're bound to get much better feedback there.", "created_utc": "1661967080.0", "edited": "False", "id": "imjqha6", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_x2igdx", "parent_id": "t3_x2igdx", "score": "2", "subreddit": "prolog", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhvg"}, {"author": "dkl_prolog", "body": "Yeah, so I had a Matriarch, 0-Coast, TR-8S, Circuit Tracks, Sonicware ELZ_1, and Model:Cycles. I sold all of it because I thought, this is taking up a huge amount of space, I'm still not learning how to play keys, I feel mostly guilt when I see all the space the stuff takes up, and I feel like other people could use this stuff better than me, I had a significant amount of debt I wanted to pay down, and there was another expensive thing I wanted to buy (a Supernote e-ink tablet), and it just seemed like the right move. I figured, I'll finally learn Bitwig, I'll get a decent soft synth (Pigments) and a not super-expensive hardware controller and then I'll be in good shape. This was about a year ago.\n\nI learned a few things from this.\n\nOne, I am far less likely to play the soft synth or with the DAW. Guess what? I'm not a music producer or composer any more than I was a keyboard player. So that gamble basically went nowhere. It turns out when I am not feeling guilted about having expensive synths, I actually do find them inviting to play, and I want to play with them.\n\nTwo, I did lose money on this. I'm not horribly offended by this because I didn't lose a huge amount of money, but I certainly didn't like make it back. This is partly because I'm impatient and I didn't want to leave something up on Reverb for six months. I wanted it to be gone in like a week, so I usually took the first offer I got, and it was gone in a few days or a week. The way I see it now, you can think of buying the synth as a long-term rental. If I buy it new for $600 and sell it for $450 six months later, it's like I rented it for $150. Buying used would have been a better way to go, because if I spent (say) $500 on it then the \"rental fee\" would have been lower.\n\nI am thinking about getting a hardware synth again, but I probably won't have the money for a long time, six months or longer. So my objective will be to get something fairly versatile that's inviting to play with, but not a bunch of things, which will take up a lot of space and impose a lot of cognitive demands. Also, I think modular/semi-modular was a mistake for me. While I love the sounds you can get from the 0-coast and the Matriarch if you are inventive, I just don't seem to have the right kind of inventive spirit. I have an easier time programming the Hydrasynth, and while it doesn't produce perfectly Moog-like sounds, it can replicate a lot of it as well as doing a million other things, and it's quite easy to modulate.\n\nSo anyway, if you're thinking of doing it, I support you.

These operators work on functions rather than numbers, which is rather beautiful in and of itself, and a glimpse of things that happen in higher math. And it turns out that the relationships between these two things recur in a lot of different areas. Rate of change, for instance, or problems of area. Once you internalize the ideas, an interesting challenge becomes, how do these ideas generalize to more complex functions, like trigonometric functions or logarithms? What does it mean to measure the \"rate of change\" of a sine wave? What does the \"area under the curve\" mean? It turns out that these ideas apply to lots of interesting problems and give you access to concrete answers that would be difficult or impossible to compute any other way. A lot of probability problems, for instance, can be formulated starting with the idea that the area under this curve must be equal to one. What shapes do we have that give rise to this? If you've heard about the \"long-tail,\" it comes from a way of thinking about the probability of things which may never happen or may only happen once, which is rather difficult to conceptualize without the ability to calculate a finite area under an infinite curve. \n\nThe real beauty of calculus is not that you can perform those computations, it's that it presents to you a few small questions whose answer requires a fundamentally different way of thinking about what math is or can be.

LingQ's theory is basically reading, reading, reading, and it should help build a larger vocabulary.

This is more-or-less how most audio compression techniques work. So the most general form of synthesis would be an infinite sum of sine waves. However, this isn't a particularly intuitive way of building a sound from scratch, apart from organs.\n\nMinimoog style subtractive synthesis produces a wide range of interesting sounds mostly by starting with a complex waveform and then passing it through an envelope and filtering it. You can make a wide array of very cool sounds this way, but it doesn't produce particularly convincing imitations of various non-synthetic instruments. To get a realistic sounding bell or piano sound, FM synthesis gets much closer. Most of the \"classic\" DX-7 patches are exactly these. FM is a very powerful technique, but programming FM patches is less intuitive than subtractive synthesis, and requires more up-front thought and less random knob-fiddling. This is because the way FM works, you start with simple waves and use them to modulate other simple waves. You can quickly produce a lot of overtones or noise this way, and then each wave has its own envelope, so you have a huge amount of control over the dynamics of the sound. My impression is that it takes a fair amount of work to get to a point where the modulating the modulator becomes intuitive, and managing all of the envelopes is not easy either.\n\nWavetable synthesis is nice because it gives you a lot of new possibilities for sound design while retaining a degree of the intuitiveness of subtractive synthesis. This is because you're still basically starting with a complex waveform, and it opens up a new modulation destination of the index of the wave. You can create a lot of really interesting sounds without a huge amount of work this way.\n\nThe other major kind of synthesis is actually physical modeling, which usually starts with a model of an exciter and a resonator. You can produce a lot of convincing imitations of woodwind, stringed and brass instruments as well as drums with this approach, but my impression is that the \"sweet spots\" are not huge. What's fascinating about this from a software side, at least to me, is that you are able to modulate things that you couldn't possibly change in reality, like size of the instrument, thickness of the strings, etc. and in so doing, synthesize \"realistic\" sounds that would be physically impossible to create in reality.\n\nThere are of course many more types of synthesis and we probably have not discovered all the interesting approaches, but between these four we have a lot of interesting ones that you can use to produce a wide array of sounds. I think it's up to personal taste why people buy what they buy. Personally, I got rid of all my hardware synths at some point just to save space and not be such a hoarder. For some people, they want good coverage for different parts of a song; for instance, monosynths tend to be better for lead/bass sounds and polysynths for pads. But fully analog polysynths tend to be expensive, so digital polysynths are not uncommon. FM is kind of a matter of taste; some people love it, some people don't like it very much. Other people just really like a few brands and will get everything. I have one friend with the Hydrasynth, Matrixbrute, Typhon, and bunch of little things besides, and another friend who has two DFAMS, a Mother-32, Matriarch, Grandmother and Subharmonicon.

I haven't tried very hard to put it into words or discussed it much with anyone.\n\n[This article about TLC and the Lakota language project](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/native-american-language-preservation-rcna31396?fbclid=IwAR0Hd3qlYbsUTqYw2AUW4Yn-B-FZZLCzldKWOf0obKzBzqLwM9aQdfoFygg) highlights an aspect of it. I think that many Native Americans regard their language as part of their intangible cultural heritage. They want to see increasing use of their language within their tribe, because loss of language is just another dimension of loss of culture, assimilation and genocide. The article talks about the difference in perspective on the materials generated by the Language Conservancy. To be reductive, it sounds to me that the Lakota consider works made in Lakota to be tribal property. Setting aside everything else, this represents a significant divergence from the prevailing Western attitude towards languages, and suggests that I am in a poor position to evaluate the appropriateness of my own interest in Navajo.\n\nThere are people living here today who were sent to boarding schools where they were physically punished for speaking Navajo. In the north-west, they're literally dying from uranium dust blowing around their land. Near me, many Navajo people have no running water or electricity. Frequently there are stories about wild dogs mauling their kids. They have bigger fish to fry than supporting some random white dude who finds their language to be beautifully intriguing. It's not like I had spent any time on the reservation, knew anything about their culture, had any Navajo friends, or even had any real deep interest in any of those things. I realized it was a little cheap of me to be going after it just for these superficial reasons, like that it looked hard, alien, and interesting. It would of course have been different if I had found my way to it along a different path, either through friends or family or through work or something like that. But I had completely fetishized the language itself.\n\nDespite that, it felt like it still would be permissible to use an unlimited resource for learning, like Duolingo. But I was also buying books. Eventually I bought a Navajo dictionary that had been printed just once in 1995, and seeing it in my house gathering dust made me realize that it wasn't doing any good for me or anyone else who was interested in Navajo for me to have this rare book. So I gave it to the local library. And I think that's when I started to realize, I was running up against the fact that some of these resources are finite, and the finite resources shouldn't be wasted on a tourist like me, they should go to someone who needs them or will at least put them to better use, for something more than a party trick.\n\nIt also would be another thing if there were Navajo folk around who were like, you can support us by learning our language. Maybe there are, on iTalki or something, but there weren't at the time. After all, supporting the native speakers is a good thing to do. But I never got the impression it was all that welcome, and the article about TLC above confirmed for me that my conceptions about what is appropriate probably isn't calibrated in a way to minimize offense.\n\nAnyway, that's a tour of the reasons for my ambivalence.", "created_utc": "1660593254.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ikfbe5b", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_wp09wn", "parent_id": "t1_ikf3qf7", "score": "5", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "dkl_prolog", "body": "[This channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/%D0%A3%D0%BA%D1%80%D0%B0%D1%97%D0%BD%D1%81%D1%8C%D0%BA%D0%BE%D1%8E%D0%9C%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%BE%D1%8E) has quite a few uploads of like Peppa Pig and Land Before Time.", "created_utc": "1660580033.0", "edited": "False", "id": "iked15n", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_wogme0", "parent_id": "t3_wogme0", "score": "2", "subreddit": "Ukrainian", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qum6"}, {"author": "dkl_prolog", "body": "This is a substantial part of why I quit Navajo.

And then I started to get the feeling that to do better would require using up more resources that were intended for Din\u00e9 people, and that Din\u00e9 people have a lot more pressing concerns than whether there are white guys in the area who speak it.

I usually have to repeat lessons many times; I've been studying since March and am currently on lesson 26. I can usually tell a huge improvement from one day to the next on the content of the lesson. But you really can't do more than one a day, and missing more than a day in between is pretty detrimental.\n\nI am also using LingQ and Glossika. Glossika follows a \"do repetitions and understanding will follow\" philosophy, so it may remind you of Pimsleur, in that you get a sentence and then repeat it back, and you repeat this process lots and lots of times. The idea here is that you're only ever exposed to complete utterances and they're being spoken in a native-like fashion. LingQ is more about letting lots of words make impressions on you, with the idea being that as you are exposed repeatedly they will begin to stick more. \n\nInitially I spent more time in Glossika but as things have progressed I am spending more time in LingQ. I think this is because I got past the initial clumsiness of pronunciation, I am OK at segmenting words when I hear speech, but my vocabulary is still very small and now Glossika is not very \"novel\" to me so it isn't very motivating. But I think I should try harder, and I do think that Glossika deserves most of the credit for the fact that I hear Ukrainian in word units and not a mess of sounds. LingQ on the other hand is a lot more varied than Glossika in terms of the input and probably is doing a lot more for growing at least a passive vocabulary.\n\nThe cons on those two apps would be that A) I sometimes hear Russian accents in Glossika's speaker (for instance, pronouncing \u0433\u0440\u0430\u0454 as \"gurayuh\") and B) most of the speech you'll hear on LingQ is either machine-generated or aimed at children.\n\nI do think that neither one is as good as Pimsleur for forcing you to produce large sentences in response to questions. It really throws me off-kilter when I'm in the middle of a lesson on counting and Pimsleur forces me to produce an unrelated sentence like \"would you like to go to dinner with me tomorrow?\" Nothing else is really good at making me try and do these native-like constructions that I think are important for building fluency. People knock Pimsleur for not teaching you a lot of anything but I think this is like a basic exercise routine; it isn't intended to get you everything, but it is intended to help you overcome that initial paralysis when you talk to someone.", "created_utc": "1660162500.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ijrk2b9", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_wl6ykw", "parent_id": "t3_wl6ykw", "score": "10", "subreddit": "Ukrainian", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qum6"}, {"author": "dkl_prolog", "body": "Write to their support address and they'll send you an 8-track license for free.", "created_utc": "1660154657.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ijqz432", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_wl4236", "parent_id": "t3_wl4236", "score": "4", "subreddit": "Bitwig", "subreddit_id": "t5_2tcsm"}, {"author": "dkl_prolog", "body": "You could always try writing to them and see if they'd give it to you for a discount or even for your budget.

It doesn't imbue any particular meaning to that operator. Without the declaration, `foo(4, 5)` doesn't mean anything, so after the declaration `4 foo 5` still doesn't mean anything.

You're going to play one instrument at a time, so lean on your skill with that and get a single strong polyphonic instrument.\n\nIn fact the need for a lot of modulation and sound design seems to go down as the number of voices goes up, because the expectation is that you're creating musical interest through your playing technique (melody and chords) rather than sound design on a simpler melody or drone sound. My impression is that sound design is a lot more relevant if you're going to play a lead or drone sound. Otherwise you're stacking up too much complexity in the sound and it's going to get murky (or not leave much room for other instruments in a composition). People like myself who are not very strong keyboardists rely on sequencers and arpeggiators to create simpler melodies and we create interest by relying more on sound design (tweaking knobs). That's probably not going to be your approach, which is fine, we are all jealous of you.\n\nYes, you need more voices if you're going to play chords, but you also see that voices tend to come in powers of two (like 2, 4, 8, or 16 voices). Sixteen voices seems like more than you need since you only have ten fingers, but in fact with longer release parameters you may need more voices than you have fingers, since you don't want to have to steal voices that should be fading out nicely. So you could probably really utilize something like a Moog One 16 voice or another synth with a lot of voices, because you can probably do the chord on the left hand, lead on the right thing that good players can do. And again, the need for complex sound design options really goes down when you can do things like that.\n\nLean into it and be Rick Wakeman. :)", "created_utc": "1659457495.0", "edited": "False", "id": "iint5mj", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_webykh", "parent_id": "t3_webykh", "score": "4", "subreddit": "synthesizers", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rdyc"}, {"author": "dkl_prolog", "body": "The only book I have read is digital, but it's pretty good: \u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0457\u043d\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0430 \u0434\u043b\u044f \u0406\u043d\u043e\u0437\u0435\u043c\u0446\u0456\u0432.

I have a template and each day I write my events for the (business) day in here, and next to it I write my todos for the day. This helps me focus on what events I have and what my tasks are for the day. Just one page. I star this page and write the date on it. Each week I usually clear out the stars from the previous week.\n- Meeting notes. Interspersed between daily pages, I take notes as things come up at work. This is mostly meetings for me. I title these meetings. In an average week, I probably take around 10 pages of notes like this.\n- Class notes. I have a separate note file for my language learning. I do my homework in pen on the device and I export it to PDF or PNG to send to my tutor. When I was taking a math class, I made a page for each day and took notes during the lecture on anything \"new\". Then I could refer back to this when I did the homework (which I had to do on the computer).\n- Document notes. For my work, I often have to read detailed documentation and respond to it. I use the bracket annotation capability with the Supernote, so when I come to a piece of information I want to take note of, refer back to, or respond to, I bracket it and then use the pop up to write my thoughts about it. Then I use the Digest function to export my thoughts for sharing with my coworkers and superiors.\n- Technical book reading. I read a lot of PDFs, and I use the Document function on the Supernote for that.\n\nI don't use the Kindle much at all, and I never use the Word, Mail or Calendar apps because they're all alpha-quality and deeply broken for me.

The mail client apparently only supports Gmail, and I have three mail accounts none of which are Gmail.

If you want to follow a web resource, the standard suggestion is Markus Triska's [The Power of Prolog](https://www.metalevel.at/prolog).\n\nIn an imperative language, you start by defining some types and some procedures. Your program runs line-by-line, executing procedures to mutate some variables, and eventually it exits. In Prolog, you instead are defining a universe of relationships. The program is a query, and satisfying that query requires looking at subqueries. A query may have unbound variables; if so, Prolog is going to use the universe of facts and relationships you have given it to try and establish variable bindings that satisfy the query.", "created_utc": "1657745662.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ig1i3nq", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_vyciyw", "parent_id": "t3_vyciyw", "score": "16", "subreddit": "prolog", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhvg"}, {"author": "dkl_prolog", "body": "I think every natural language is comparably complex, it's just a question of where that complexity is lurking and whether it is more similar or different from the one you already know.

I couldn't reliably differentiate \u0442 and \u0442\u044c until about two weeks ago, and it was with a lot of coaching from u/serhiy_b. I would say I can hear palatalization in most letters now and I can produce it in most, but for the first few months it felt pretty hopeless.\n\nI have the advantage with \u0445 that I had learned a little Hebrew before. My impression is that Hebrew \"chai\" ch- sound is rougher than Ukrainian \u0445 sound but they seem perfectly willing to accept it. To figure it out, make a \"k\" sound several times so you can feel what is happening in your mouth. This is a plosive sound, so you are completely constricting the airflow and then releasing it. If you zero in on the moment when you release it, you may be able to figure out how to relax slightly and push some air through. This is the \u0445 sound.\n\nWith \u0449, I also sometimes seem to produce just \u0448 and it seems to me that in speech they will sometimes accept it and sometimes not. For instance, it seems like \u0431\u043e\u0440\u0449 cannot be rendered \u0431\u043e\u0440\u0448, but sometimes \u0449\u043e can be accepted as \u0448\u043e. I am still very new and can't say when this is true or when it is not. Also I have recently learned from u/EAGauss that native English speakers like myself usually render \u0448 as something like \u0448\u044c, a sound that doesn't exist in Ukrainian and is a little off-putting, so we sound better if we retract our tongue slightly and do not round the lips while we make this sound. If you're like me, when you do \"sh\" you will always round your lips and your tongue is fairly advanced.\n\nI have been working on \u0433/\u0445 for a long time and it's still not great. The page u/Sv1a linked was a huge help to me, I just listened to the minimal pairs over and over again until I started to hear a sort of \"revving-up\" sound at the start of \u0433 which isn't present for \u0445. This is because \u0433 must be voiced and \u0445 must not. The linguist inside me wonders if what is really going on here is voiced and unvoiced velar approximants. This jibes with the explanation u/EAGauss gave me, that it is like making a \"g\" sound, deleting the plosive and extending the release. It also jibes with the fact that these explanations always seem to seize on the importance of making a \u0433/\u0491 distinction, which sound completely different to my ears as an English speaker, well beyond confusion. \n\nBoth u/serhiy_b and u/EAGauss spent considerable time with me trying to teach me these sounds and I am still fairly confused on them. It may also be the case that there are two sounds here which in English are allophones, so we are making them both all the time but not conscious of the distinction that they are hearing. This would explain why on the Iryna's page she can say one sound is like \"hot\" and the other is like \"hook.\"\n\nI think u/Same_0ld is right, the best solution is to get a teacher. Because then you make the sound, they can correct you, and hopefully help you zero in on what you are doing wrong. I would add that using something like Glossika is a good idea, because being repeatedly given input with the distinction will help you hear it. Also, when you are with your instructor, you may not be able to _hear_ the distinction despite being able to _produce_ it. Practicing producing it correctly will help you be able to hear it\u2014it sounds backwards but it seems to be true. Now that I can make \u0442/\u0442\u044c, I hear it a lot more readily as well.\n\nI started with Glossika in listening-only mode but I am starting this week to use transcription because I think that will help a lot too.\n\nNow I have a question for you: are you having trouble with \u0438?

Look at, among other things, [bi-yi prefixing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navajo_grammar#yi-/bi-_Alternation_(animacy)). You'll see there is a huge amount of repetition in the beginnings of verbs here because it is prefixing. This is OK.\n\nWord compounding is also part of morphology, it's derivational morphology rather than inflexional morphology. Also covered in books about morphology.\n\nAlso, I would suggest you make a few small languages just to try out your syntactic ideas. If it makes sense to you in a small language, it will generalize to your magnum opus.

Both the original atom bombs required conventional explosives to compress the fissile material fast enough and tight enough to cause a runaway reaction. At Chornobyl, it was steam from the heat of the nuclear reaction that caused the explosion, not the fissile material itself. This is why when we talk about nuclear accidents with reactors we are mostly talking about meltdown: the problem that the fissile material gets so hot it melts itself and its container. You don't get a big boom just from the material itself.\n\nSecondarily, even the RBMK was designed so that a loss of power would cause the reactor to coast down to nothing by dropping the control rods. Obviously the graphite-tipping of the control rods was not understood as an accelerant, and that is a design flaw, but even the earliest reactors were designed so that loss of control systems would cause the reactor to cruise down.\n\nIn fact, I believe even Chornobyl would have done the right thing if it weren't for the fact it had been operated at an unsafe low-power mode prior to the test, and even then, it might have been safe if the RBMK design had been 1/4th the size it was.

Which is fine with me, it's their heritage not mine, and nobody takes Zia seriously about our co-opting their symbol for the flag. On top of the usual disinclination to share, some stories are only to be shared during certain seasons, and beyond that there are plenty of topics they are forbidden from talking about at all. These are of course the forbidden fruit for outsiders like us, so there are lots of people who try to ask questions about these things and get rebuffed.

This is because in an analytic language you expect to see mostly unbound morphemes and mostly a low morpheme to word ratio. In an inflecting language, the morphemes are often bound. You cannot say in English, for instance, \"I am walk to the car ing,\" you have to say \"I am walking to the car,\" nor can you reply to a question like \"are you walking or did you walk?\" with \"ing.\" Also in an inflecting language, they often convey more than one piece of information. English is not a great source of examples of this, but take Latin where the word \"vocare\" inflects to \"voco,\" and the \"-o\" ending means 1st person singular, which is two facts. Lojban definitely doesn't have any particles that change shape or convey more than one piece of information.\n\nYou could point to an agglutinating language, and you'd again have the property that there is usually one morpheme per particle, but they are mostly bound particles. You couldn't ask in Finnish if it was a person or a cup and get back the ending \"-ainen\" without a word attached to it. So Lojban doesn't have this property so it's not an agglutinating language.\n\nLojban likes to pretend on Wikipedia that it can be treated as a polysynthetic or agglutinating language. This is because you may build complex words by using their rafsi forms.

Also if you just want to know if something is present in a list and you don't need to enumerate the whole list, you can try `memberchk/2`. These are both ISO. In terms of any/all, we do have `forall/2` and `foreach/2`; in practice, `forall/2` is ISO and uses a failure-driven loop which can sometimes have side-effects you don't want, and `foreach/2` is an SWI-specific thing.\n\nMost of the time, you can do funny tricks with the goal in `setof/3`/`bagof/3` to achieve \"all\" type effects; for instance, if you want all the even numbers in a certain range, you can use a trick like this:\n\n    even(X) :- X mod 2 =:= 0.\n\n    ?- setof(X, (between(1,10,X), even(X)), Evens).\n    Evens = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10].\n\nDon't forget you can use `apropos(foo)` to ask SWI about predicates with a certain name, or you can search at their website, it's pretty friendly IMO.\n\nFor 2, I want to say you're thinking very functionally and you need to take a step back and worry about thinking Prolog-ishly. You may not realize it, for instance, but Prolog does not really have N-tuples, so when you say `X=(1+2,3+4,5+6)`, you're saying `X=','(1+2, ','(3+4, 5+6))` which is an uncomfortable data structure in Prolog. It would be better to just use a list here.\n\nProlog does have `maplist` and you could use that here, but you're again in a functional mindset, trying to take a list of inputs through some function to get a list of outputs, and Prolog predicates are more general than functions; they relate N things together in ways that may or may not be inputs or outputs. So you're imposing a restriction as soon as you want functions and outputs.\n\nIn this particular case, the easiest thing to do is basically try an evaluation and if it fails, give back the value. This requires setting up a try-catch in Prolog, which is weird and something you just don't see that often, because it suggests that there's something funky about your data structure. You could also do it with some overt tests, something like:\n\n    try_eval(X, R) :- atomic(X) -> R = X; R is X.\n\nThen your maplist would work: `maplist(try_eval, [1+2,foo,5+6], Y)`.

I \"learned\" the Ukrainian Cyrillic in a few days, but I continue to have issues with it, like: \n\n- Reading \u0440 as p and not r, \u0432 as b and not v, etc.\n- Sometimes I just stare at \u043f and have trouble remembering what it sounds like\n- It definitely seems to take me one \"pass\" to get the sounds right and then another \"pass\" to put the stress where it goes, assuming it is notated (and each of those \"passes\" may take more than one attempt to get right)\n- Many of the italic forms seem to have an \"April fools\" sort of relationship to the regular form, especially \u0442 and _\u0442_\n- I often forget that just because a formation takes several characters, it does not need to be pronounced for a long time (such as \u0438\u0439)\n\nI also have some \"interesting\" phonetic issues:\n\n- The sound \u0438 seems to \"move around\" on me a lot (is it \"ih\", is it \"ui\", is it \"eh\"? seems to depend on if it is the stressed vowel and other things) It's as though the sound \"slips away\" from me\n- I have trouble not reducing unstressed vowels to the shwa\n- I of course have a lot of trouble distinguishing \u0433 and \u0445\n- I have gotten mixed reviews on my \u0440 sound; sometimes it seems to be fine for it to be a \"tap\" r, but I think there are words where they really do mean for it to be rolled in certain positions, and I have no intuition for that, plus I have to \"rev up\" to do a rolled r in a very unnatural way\n\nOn top of this, while I find Ukrainian to be a very beautiful language, I find Cyrillic to be, frankly, kind of an ugly orthography, and having radically different shapes for italic and handwriting is not improving the situation. \n\nHowever, I have been reading English for 30-35 years. I have been reading Ukrainian for a month. I have been speaking English for 38 years. I have been speaking Ukrainian for a month. The fact that I can already sound out a word after one month, compared to a baby, is kind of amazing. If I were sounding out words I already knew, it would be much easier to find the stress, because I'd already know it intuitively. I don't have the advantage of having grown up around the language. So the issues I have that kids do not have, make sense in terms of the amount of input I have. And I will continue to mistake \u0440 for p for a while longer probably, but eventually I won't. And after I internalize a few thousand Ukrainian words, \u0438 will stop being so slippery.\n\nWe're going to get there. We just need to be patient. We had decades to get there with our L1s, and we're trying to get there in hours with our L2s. It's amazing we can do this at all.

As such, I don't really consider it a general purpose programming language the way Haskell is. Rust is able to achieve its goals by making pretty heavy demands of the programmer. The programmer accepts the extra work because they have already decided they want the performance and security benefits. This is a unique posture among widely used languages.\n\nI think it should be possible to create a viable Rust alternative that is purely functional. Do you remember the famous \"safety vs. usefulness\" chart that Simon Peyton Jones made? I see Rust coming from the performance corner and pushing towards safety by annoying the developer into not doing unsafe things, using the borrow checker to prove it. You could do the same thing from the ML side, coming from the safety corner and pushing towards performance by annoying the developer into not doing inefficient things. \n\nFor instance, Haskell can get amazing performance out of laziness, deforestation and stream fusion, but because it's somewhat magical, it isn't obvious when you have accessed the right combination to get the benefit. There could be a research line here into a \"fusion checker\" that, like the borrow checker, attunes the programmer's attention to the aspects of the system that ordinarily have hidden effects, in this case, by preventing you from accidentally generating intermediate data.

The metal is cool, until it gets dinged up or scratched. The Supernote is meant to be functional and it's a bit more rugged. It doesn't look like an executive plaything, it looks like business. At least to me. I like it a lot better.\n2. The regeneration is very cool. You can press _really_ hard, and then you think \"oh god, I scratched it\" and you can see it fix itself before your eyes. It's neat. I would agree with others who have said it has a gel pen feel. The writing is very low friction. It's like pen on paper, not pencil on paper\u2014you feel \"give\" from the screen like a tablet of paper. I find it extremely ergonomic, much more so than actual pen and paper.\n3. The HoM pen is great and I have no complaints about it.\n4. I'm hoping that the $550ish price tag for the Supernote represents a more _sustainable_ price than the $400 for the RM2. Note that they are now charging monthly fees because it wasn't actually sustainable for them at the price they were charging. So it's a bit of a red herring to compare the prices between a failing company and a company that isn't failing. In a couple years, they'll be going for much more than $400 on ebay (but of course without their servers who knows what the device will still be able to do). Also, by the time you get all the add-ons for the RM2, you're not really saving much over the Supernote. Unless you live in Europe and have amazing duties to pay.\n\nIf Apple were making these things, they would cost $200, but none of these companies are able to leverage scale or end-to-end manufacturing to get to the kinds of prices you would like to see.

The key innovation in the WAM (at least, as I understand it) is that there are two stacks, the \"normal\" call/return stack, and the \"trail\", for fail/retry. Basically, this gives you a way to handle Prolog's non-determinism but still have something akin to machine code. To produce the WAM code, you have to take the AST and convert it to your WAM code. It sounds to me like Trealla just keeps the AST around and doesn't convert it to another structure.\n\nKnowing nothing else I would expect that this design decision uses more memory but ultimately simplifies the interpreter coding. Since memory isn't as spare as it was in the 80s, this is probably a sound design decision. I would note that most languages have found great performance benefits from switching to an abstract machine implementation. Some of those benefits obviously are not going to be available to Trealla. The usual way that you benchmark this kind of thing, though, is to write numerical code in a tight loop, which is already not really Prolog's wheelhouse. I would expect that the author is wagering that in real world Prolog usage the benefits do not outweigh the cost, and that's probably true.\n\nI'll note that SWI is usually considered a fairly slow Prolog implementation compared to YAP, XSB, and it does use the WAM.

It could be that your third table is much smaller than your first two, so it could start looking there. Prolog isn't able to leverage this knowledge because it has a defined search order (SLD resolution), and besides, the predicates can have all sorts of side-effects that might be observable if you reorder your query's clauses (`asserta/1`, `retract/1` etc or the cut). This is part of what makes Datalog different from Prolog.\n\nThere is a difference between list-based predicates that do set operations and having the same kind of holistic set-theoretic basis that a traditional RDBMS has. An example would be that to do some thing like set difference with the list-flavored predicates, you'd have to materialize both your relations to lists to pass into that predicate. Otherwise, you're going to make a query that encodes the set difference somehow (such as `foo(X), \\+ bar(X)`) and you're not really working at the level of the relations, you're working at the level of items in the relation. And again, Prolog is confined to doing this in the order you specified, it can't use any knowledge it might have about the cardinality of these relations to choose different orderings (where Datalog could).\n\nNote that I'm not saying that you couldn't build a proper RDBMS in Prolog, and even write queries in Prolog that would perform (you would probably want meta-interpretation for this to have freedom in your evaluation order). I'm saying that Prolog _by itself_ isn't a viable alternative to SQL. It's too big and general.

If you don't work on the grammar of your language, it'll wind up inheriting the grammar of your spoken language more-or-less, so you'll wind up with a \"relex\" of English (English with the words replaced with your words).\n\nMorphology refers to how words change. In English, we have a couple of processes, but they're very simple: the verb \"to encode\" becomes \"encodes,\" \"encoding\" or \"encoded\" depending on how it's used, but the word is still \"encode.\" The way the word changes is the morphology. We also have ways of creating new words by attaching parts to the word, which is how you get \"antidisestablishmentarianism\" from basically the root word \"establish,\" adding \"anti-\" (opposite) \"dis-\" (against) (establish) \"-ment\" (thingify) \"-arian\" (person-who) \"-ism\" (philosophy-of). Different languages will have different morphology; the simplest choice to make here is \"no morphology,\" which is not an insane choice at all\u2014Toki Pona went this route, for instance. You can also go in the opposite direction and try to stuff as much as you can in here, rendering agglutinative or polysynthetic languages. Most of the languages you're likely to be familiar with are somewhere in the middle\u2014English does some, Romance languages do more, and are usually referred to as \"inflecting\" or \"fusional\" because one ending conveys lots of ideas (like in Latin, a verb ending in \"-nt\" means \"third person plural\", which is really two separate ideas).\n\nSyntax is the next step up from this, concerning sentence structure. The initial decision to make here is the fundamental word order. Most languages are either subject-verb-object (like English: \"she poked the cat\") or subject-object-verb. All the other arrangements are also possible but less common. You can get quite a lot done with just this one choice, but if you choose SOV, you probably want your adjectives and adverbs and whatnot to go after the thing they modify; if choose SVO it's more flexible, but you should pick one and be consistent.\n\nBoth of these are very big topics though!

That's a smell.\n\nOn the Supernote, I think most of the settings under \"Preferred setting\" shouldn't exist.\n\n - Gesture eraser and gesture to last viewed page should work so well nobody could even want to disable them\n - Anti-aliasing, I don't know why you would turn it off, but if there is a reason why you would, it should be addressed (quality?)\n - Whether the annotation shows A or D seems ridiculous too\u2014just pick one and we will live with it\n\nIn my case and I think yours, the problem is basically that the Word feature is immature.

But as a user, I would prefer if the gestures were perfect, and so forth. It's a lot to ask of them. But adding a setting is really a concession. And then if they do improve the gesture, how can they remove the setting? The people they most need to test the improvements are those who disabled the feature in the first place. If they yank the setting away, those people will get angry, and they're the ones most likely to discover new bugs too. So adding a setting kind of paints them into a corner.\n\nIf they're reading this, I hope they aren't offended. I think they're doing an amazing job.

Then the answer to the question is \"sometimes.\" For instance, you could remove the odd integers from the integers, and you'll have an infinite set left over (the even integers). But if you remove all the integers from the integers, you'll have nothing left. A lot of infinite sets wind up having the same cardinality as the integers\u2014the first important example being fractions, which seems like it should be a lot bigger than the integers because it contains the integers.

Procedural languages all work based on a \"do this, then do that\" paradigm, for instance, but it isn't necessarily the only way to do it. You can also create effective languages based on the idea of unifying variables with solutions (Prolog), evaluating mathematical functions without side-effects (FP languages like Haskell), even simply doing matrix operations (APL), searching for rule applications (CLIPS), term rewriting (Pure), or \"string-machine\" type work (SNOBOL). So long as there is a formal and precise way to encode work, you can create a programming language for it. \n\nI think a con-programming language for a conlang-speaking con-world would be very interesting. For instance, if you had a quantum parallel-universes conworld and they had a machine with a \"fork universe\" and \"delete universe\" operator, you could create a language around the idea of generating possible universes and destroying ones that do not contain the solution (this is the \"quantum bogosort\" joke). So if they have a way of discussing possible worlds (perhaps with some irrealis moods of various kinds) and it is part of their cognitive experience of the world and their computer systems, it would make sense for their programming languages to include support for this in some kind of first-class or syntactic manner.\n\nAnother thing which I think is underexplored is that programming languages are all (with the possible exception of some jokes like Latin Perl) completely isolating. They may have other features from natural languages (for example, you can think of OOP as generally being SVO since you typically have `subject.verb(object)`, and Forth as being SOV since you typically get `noun noun verb`, and thus Lisp winds up being VSO with `(verb noun noun)`) but our parsing theory for automata is basically all about isolating features that do not inflect. I often wonder if this technical limitation would be lifted if computers were first programmed in Navajo or Finnish instead of English. \n\nThis points to a difference between programming languages and natural languages, which is that typically programming languages have very little redundancy; if it exists, it's usually in the type annotations. I suspect that types and sets would arise in alien societies much like they did for us (although the notation might be more consistent!) so I expect that part would remain similar, but a lot of natural language agreement and whatnot introduces redundancy that we don't seem to see a need to recapitulate in programming languages. But what would a programming language look like if it involved inflections on the data or functions? I wonder what sorts of things you'd be able to do with that. \n\nJ uses natural language terms for its \"parts of speech\", so they talk about \"adverbs\" but in other languages we would probably call those higher-order functions, or functions that take functions as arguments and return modified functions. This concept though, functions modifying functions, is probably not deeply explored enough and could be promoted to a special syntax in an alien language.\n\nBy the way, APL was originally invented as a notation for chalkboards. I've heard that Iverson was surprised when he saw it actually running on a machine, but that might be a folktale.

If you want me to give you a hint, it's \"difference lists\" and Markus Triska (who replied to you above) has [an excellent tutorial](https://www.metalevel.at/prolog) on Prolog, and there is a section on this inside the part about [DCGs](https://www.metalevel.at/prolog/dcg), which he mentioned to you already (\"definite clause grammars\").\n\nThe accumulator pattern is fairly common, yes. In functional languages, folds became common and made accumulators rather obsolete. But because Prolog deals in relations, you don't have return values per-se, so folds (while they exist) are not as commonly used. Also, I would say that functional languages tend to dwell in the realm of lists for a long time as a way of obtaining nondeterminism, but we have a more general approach to nondeterminism here.\n\nWe also have other toys that are a lot of fun, like data structures with holes (of which difference lists are an instance), meta-interpretation, constraint programming...", "created_utc": "1639094635.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hnx54ne", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_rctdbh", "parent_id": "t1_hnx37y5", "score": "2", "subreddit": "prolog", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhvg"}, {"author": "dkl_prolog", "body": "First of all, welcome! Glad you are enjoying Prolog! I think the P-99 is an excellent way of learning the language, personally, and reviewing the other solutions after you come up with your own is just a great idea!\n\nThe main reason to choose an accumulator would be for performance. Something like `append(A, [X], R)`is going to perform not-awesomely, since it has to make lots of lists only to throw them away. But, on page 288 of *Art of Prolog*, you will find an implementation of reversing that is different from both of these that will blow your mind. :)\n\nIf you want to know why a cut is used, often the simplest thing to do is just remove it and see what sort of bad behavior you get as a result. Cuts often result in \"backwards-incorrectness\" so I try not to use them\u2014I use `once/1` instead if I really need it; I know it's the same as a cut, but somehow I find it easier to reason about.\n\nWhen you notice Prolog has gone off into outer space (well, SWI anyway) you can hit \"ctrl-C\" and it will bring up a prompt. From that prompt, you can press \"t\" to get a backtrace. I did that and got this for your solution:\n\n    continue (trace mode)   Call: (2,721) lists:append(_83102, [2], [_32572, _32584, _32596, _32608, _32620, _32632, _32644|...]) ?\n\nThis strongly suggests to me that Prolog is \"hallucinating\" a large list. And in fact, there is no real relationship between your inputs and `A`, so Prolog is just fruitlessly trying to come up with a list that it can pass to p5 that will make it true. The problem really is that you're appending to the reversed list before you have the reversed list, so you can solve it by just swapping the order of your append and p5 statements:\n\n    p5([], []).\n    p5([X|L], R) :- p5(L, A), append(A, [X], R).\n\nProlog still needs to process in a certain order, and this is a common stumbling block for logically-minded folks.\n\nAnyway, welcome!

Well, they're more than that, but that is a big part of the appeal. Supernote has better organizational functionalities for your notes and note-taking strengths (bracket notes for instance). As a student, I think it would be hard to beat. And in terms of software I think the Max Lumi is again basically an Android tablet with an e-ink screen. Boox has a nice reader I understand. I don't know much about their note taking app.\n\nFor sending in homework, it's going to come through as A5 paper from a Supernote. I think the situation is the same with Remarkable. You could annotate a PDF of any paper size and send it back with writing on it using the export function. So that might help you.\n\nNow, as a teacher, I would be considering the [Papyr](https://www.quirklogic.com/products/papyr). It's A4-sized and has an impressive presentation mode where you are drawing on the tablet and it's live-synced to a website. You can allow others to modify the document at the same time as you, if you wish, or you could just project it. This also means you can draw in color, even though you can't see it on the device, it is respected through the shared app.\n\nI think it defaults to doing an infinite canvas. This is probably useful for presentations. It also has PDF reading and annotating (I think it actually will let you add pages to the PDF, which is a very unique function and probably super useful).\n\n[MobiScribe](https://mobiscribe.com/) also has a shared presentation mode, but I think at the moment it is limited to syncing to other MobiScribes. I believe this is changing as they develop MobiShare for sharing their documents. It's also the smallest of the devices on the list with a 6.8\" screen IIRC. I actually ordered one and had to return it unopened for financial reasons, but I do intend to actually get one at some point.\n\nSo, as a student, I would strongly recommend the Supernote. As a teacher, I would really consider the Papyr, especially if real-time drawing is part of what you want. I don't think anything else really comes close on that front. I don't have a Papyr, but I did think about it.\n\nIf there's an Apple store near you, I would recommend checking out the sizes of tablets they have. I was really thinking about getting a 13\" eInk tablet until I went and tried out all the iPad sizes. This helped me realize that 13\" is probably too big for me, and for me 10\"/A5 is \"just right.\" It's a little big for taking to the grocery store, but it's a good size for taking notes.

I loved the idea of Rocketbook and I love the company, and if you have $30 to spare, it's nice. In fact you'll notice a lot of posts here about how to repurpose a Frixion pen with a Supernote nib refill.\n\nIn terms of \"workflow,\" what you get with Rocketbook is a notebook you can erase with water or friction. The erasure isn't completely perfect because you're still putting pressure lines in the paper. The Rocketbook app then can scan the pages and will do some magical auto-correction for the camera angle. It has a \"destination\" concept where you can check different icons on the bottom of the page, and the app will auto-send the scanned pages to those destinations\u2014places like iCloud, Dropbox, Evernote, etc. And IIRC, it will OCR the text.\n\nIn my experience, the app was easy enough to use, but the OCR wasn't very good, and now you've got either a bad text report, or a bulky image PDF or PNG export of your handwriting. You still have to figure out how to manage those files on a computer somewhere.\n\nI actually think I got more use out of the Rocketbook Beacons stickers for my whiteboard. Their app would detect whatever was in a rectangle using the beacons and auto-update it via a sharing URL, so you could write on a whiteboard and share it. I also got their backpack, and frankly it was one of the nicest backpacks I ever owned, until my son stole it from me.\n\nThe situation with the Supernote is very different. The idea here is not that it's going to be an unlimited pad of paper, although it is that. The idea here is that it's going to become the hub for all of your reading, writing, note-taking and drawing. You're not going to have to manage a bunch of PDFs on the computer because you'll be using the Supernote as your primary note device, and you'll be interacting with it via its UI\u2014starred files and pages, its unique title mechanism, keywords, global search. It's going to be more like having an unlimited number of notebooks, each one equipped with powerful organizational abilities of its own. You'll be able to create new pages in the middle of any notebook. You'll be able to use their excellent templates or add your own to create more order. Everything will be arranged in a filesystem on the device, you can create your own note hierarchies. And as u/rehoboam said, you'll be able to write in pen but also copy, paste, move your writing around on the page, and do other edits not even physically possible with pen and paper or Rocketbook.\n\nThere's no built-in workflow with either of these, but what is enabled with Rocketbook is really just what you have now with paper. It makes it relatively painless to have scans of your paper in various places. Supernote doesn't have a built-in workflow either, but it has so much interesting and useful functionality\u2014like bracket annotations for PDFs\u2014that you can build powerful workflows around. They're not very similar to each other.\n\nSo, your friend's right in a way that if you aren't sure, $30 is a safer bet than $550. But Supernote isn't just about replacing paper.

Once a platform has the bulk of the developers, it tends to stay that way. Mac wasn't always this way, but Apple spent the better part of a decade luring us over there while Microsoft was kind of unable to get their stuff together.\n\nUnderneath all that though, the audience for the platforms is different. Linux treats you as an *operator*, rather than a *user*. The guts are available for you to inspect and tinker with, and the system does not assume that it knows better than you. And Mac OS X had a similar feel for a long time\u2014although these days it seems to be transitioning away from that.\n\nFor a long time, Windows did not roll out the red carpet for developers. The tools mostly cost money versus free tools for Linux and mostly free for Mac, minus a code signing certificate.\n\nBeing an effective programmer of any stripe really has nothing to do with your platform of choice. However, if you're on a team with people using the other platform, you will create inertia for them, and if the rest of them are using Mac OS X and you're using Windows, you need to be good enough at it so that they don't resent having to help you.
