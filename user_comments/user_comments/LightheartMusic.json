For me, at the NYC testing center they said it would take about three weeks, but it in reality it took closer to a month and a half. \n\nIf Chicago\u2019s no good, your only real choices are to take it somewhere else, or to take a gap year and apply next year. In that time, you could work and save up money so you\u2019ve got spending money in France (it can be expensive to live in a foreign country before you adapt). Don\u2019t forget, once you\u2019re going to France you\u2019ll need to apply for a long-stay visa BEFORE you leave, which takes a while.

You\u2019d end up graduating around the same time as your peers, since the French \u00ablicense \u00bb is only three years long compared to the four years of an American bachelor\u2019s degree.

They may very well use low-quality audio, with children speaking really quickly  (that\u2019s what they did for mine). So practice that skill. The other thing I would recommend is to practice writing formal letters. Memorize the formatting, a stock opening, and a stock ending phrase. I found this to be the most helpful.

It isn't easy for LingQ to parse sentences written in Japanese. Probably because Japanese uses logograms and lacks spaces between words, so the word boundaries are not obvious, and so LingQ sometimes thinks that two words next to each other are one word. Or sometimes it thinks that the ending of a verb is actually some other word. So when that happens, and it's no longer automatic, you have to select the words manually and choose the best definition.

And so none of them can hurt me. No one can implicate me in ugliness. Nor can I feel angry at my relative, or hate him. We were born to work together like feet, hands and eyes, like the two rows of teeth, upper and lower. To obstruct each other is unnatural. To feel anger at someone, to turn your back on him: these are unnatural.\"\n\nI think this is a key part of behaving morally. You can, and should, recognize good and bad behavior. That does not mean, however, that you need to treat the person who does something wrong unfairly. In spite of the constant meanness, and failings, etc, of other people, we still need to work together in order to live, in order to reach our highest potential. If someone does something reprehensible, and you can't forgive them, then that's the time to wipe the dust off your shoes and move on. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo how do we tell what's good and what's bad? Hard question that I can't answer. Leaving stoicism aside for a moment, I think that Kant might be helpful if you want to think about right and wrong. I'm not a big fan of his work, but he really helped clarify these issues for me. Maybe read some summaries of his books (they are dense and difficult), and watch some youtube videos. For me, the key takeaway from his work, is that we need to treat people as people, and not as tools that we can use. He thought that we can't treat people as means to an end (ie, being nice to this person will get me promoted/sexually satisfied/happy/delicious food/etc), but as ends in and of themselves.\n\nSo you can ask yourself when dealing with other people \"Is this for me? Or am I doing this for the other person?\" If you're doing something for yourself, the action is less likely to be good, and certainly wouldn't be moral. Don't obsess about this, however. For the most part you probably already know what's right and what's wrong.", "created_utc": "1637482879.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hlhkost", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_qy8lse", "parent_id": "t3_qy8lse", "score": "1", "subreddit": "Stoicism", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r4kq"}, {"author": "LightheartMusic", "body": "I agree that it\u2019s difficult to write sexuality and avoid being creepy, but it\u2019s definitely not impossible.
