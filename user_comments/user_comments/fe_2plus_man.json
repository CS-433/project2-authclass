I have previously worked with many NPs who didn't know anything about anything but were entrusted to make decisions they had no business being within 10 miles of. Those decisions hurt patients. And then when they get to go somewhere and practice unsupervised and cause more harm? Everything gets worse.\n\nThen there's the whole \"calling yourself a doctor in a clinical\" setting thing, aka intentionally confusing people about the role. No one says PhDs in art history should be calling themselves Doctor in a hospital or clinic because they have a doctorate (ignoring the difference in caliber between PhD vs DNP/DNAP/DMsc - one has honest rigor while the other exist to further obfuscation) - so why is there becoming a push to have non-physicians do so in those settings? \n\nIn the end, if you want to practice medicine, do the time and work to become a real expert. 500 hours if online school then practicing independently to allegedly \"learn on the job\" hurts people, increases healthcare system costs, and further erodes trust in our system.", "created_utc": "1666448947.0", "edited": "False", "id": "itc2ht6", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_yaotgn", "parent_id": "t3_yaotgn", "score": "534", "subreddit": "Residency", "subreddit_id": "t5_2t8qv"}, {"author": "fe_2plus_man", "body": "I mean yeah, 40 years ago the left point may have been true, but you know they've currently been lobbying to increase residency spots and FINALLY seems to have a president with an interest in preserving physician lead care, right?\n\nI'm obviously not claiming they're perfect (they are FLAGRANTLY not and have issues on issues on issues) but like it or not, they are our representative in organized medicine.

All acceptable terms. I think angiocath is actually a brand name (like Kleenex) and one of those situations where the brand name has turned into the generic name (like kleenex). \n\nBroadly speaking, because at one point I tried to figure out wtf the difference between a catheter and cannula is, it's the following: \n\n\"In medicine, a catheter is a thin tube made from medical grade materials serving a broad range of functions\"\n\n\"A cannula is a tube that can be inserted into the body, often for the delivery or removal of fluid or for the gathering of samples. In simple terms, a cannula can surround the inner or outer surfaces of a trocar needle thus extending the effective needle length by at least half the length of the original needle.\"\n\n\nYou can see how catheter and cannula can refer to the same thing with peripheral access. A cannula basically always has a trocar/needle (which facilitates the process of cannulating). So a central line, due to lack of needle/trocar inside the line, is considered a catheter. A Foley, lack of trocar, catheter.\n\n\nIf you place a pigtail chest tube, you put a trocar or dilator inside ---> you make it a cannula. It's also fair to call it a catheter.\n\nPretty much all plastic cannula can be considered catheters, but all catheters aren't necessarily cannulae. Hope this helps.

I don't see the point in pretending to be an enlightened centrist.\n\nThere are certainly excellent anesthesiologists and excellent CRNAs, just as there are poor versions of both. However, the fact there are bad anesthesiologists after all of that training is more of an argument for supervision than anything - if you can be bad after doing all of that, how is someone with a fraction of your knowledge and training supposed to be trusted? Do you also think we should let residents who hace completely CA1 year practice independent anesthesia - they will have racked up plenty of supervised hours, and on top of that gone through the rigors of medical school.\n\nI'm all for team based care - but (1) teams have leaders and (2) in order for a team to work, all team members need to agree on the value of a team. I work in excellent teams with AAs and with residents right now. I've had the pleasure of working in teams with excellent CRNAs before. But the fact is, their national organization is pushing a narrative that their training makes them better at administering anesthetics than anesthesiologists, and that we don't care about patients, only money.

Vast majority of the time, you're absolute right - the lack of ability to use oxygen is because of the lack of oxygen there. For example - frank hypoxia (covid, anyone?), sepsis (lots of data suggesting mitochondrial dysfunction is the cause of lactate production and increased SvO2 in sepsis, rather than simply hypermetabolism), hypovolemia (hence the aforementioned lacto-bolo reflex), cardiac failure (if you can't pump oxygen to the tissues in a timely fashion, they ain't going to be able to use O2 as their primary route of ATP production --> shunt glucose to lactic acid cycle). Hypermetabolism itself will cause it (e.g. if you're so hyperthyroid that you use more energy than your body is able to make; if you juse seized). \n\nThen you have things like beta-2 stimulation, which inherently will promote lactate production. Where is this notable? In patients who you're giving albuterol too. A classic \"death spiral\" (at least in my head, and which I teach my medical students/residents/fellows) is the patient with bad asthma exacerbation that comes in --> loads of albuterol ---> now has a lactate. People bolus lactate because obviously lactate means hypovolemia right? Breathing gets worse, so more albuterol, which causes more lactate, which causes more fluid...you see where this is going.\n\nYou're definitely right that memorizing every step of the Kreb's cycle is not imperative to your life (unless you're a geneticist, I suppose). But I think the idea around it broadly --> the importance of recognizing that there are many, many causes of glucose being shunted into anaerobic metabolism rather than aerobic metabolism, is SUPER important. It's misunderstanding can lead, IMO, to serious misdiagnosis and patient harm.\n\nI think knowing co-factors of the Kreb's cycle (e.g. thiamine) can also help ascertaining why you have a lactic acidemia. Anyway - just something to consider!

But I work in an ICU, and in some way shape or form, lactate comes up at least 5x/shift. Why's this matter? \n\nBecause the lacto-bolo reflex is a thing, and not all lactate needs fluids. Understanding the Krebs cycle can help you find other causes of said lactate (e.g. thiamine deficiency, especially in malnourished or CRRT patients. NADH regeneration failure, e.g. in someone who ingested a bunch of APAP or has some liver injury. Etc etc). And if you rule out the easy stuff, you may even go down the route of looking for acquired Krebs cycle disorders (extremely rare, but hey - you\u2019re a physician because you have to know how to think past option A and B).\n\nMy $0.02, anyway", "created_utc": "1640048939.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hpd7z8h", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_rkx9xe", "parent_id": "t1_hpct2op", "score": "121", "subreddit": "medicalschool", "subreddit_id": "t5_2re2p"}, {"author": "fe_2plus_man", "body": "*Rick and Morty meme* oh boy, here I go getting triggered again \n\n\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d", "created_utc": "1640031770.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hpc4qw6", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_rkqyku", "parent_id": "t1_hpc03a7", "score": "4", "subreddit": "CFB", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qm9d"}, {"author": "fe_2plus_man", "body": "(1) I\u2019ve been working on improving my Spanish, because I like the language and would like to improve my understanding of many of the cultures (I.e.

I agree that taking issue with an individual can be very much counterproductive - especially if they're one that actually remains in their appropriate scope as a physician extender. I have had the food fortune of working with people like that, and they're really wonderful. But I also find it completely disingenuous to claim that it's like some small fraction of NPPs that want independence. Especially when they are straight up being used to replace physicians in multiple places already.\n\nIf we had more residency spots, we would have more physicians. We need that, not Kore NPPs playing independently practicing doctor. Sadly, the physicians of yesteryear preferred to create non-physician roles instead of lobbying for more residency spots. The balanced budget act in the Clinton era capped residency funding. And now, you see \"APP residencies\" and \"APP fellowships\" popping up - do you think that terminology is a coincidence? It's intentional obfuscation, with the goal of confusing the public. The same with \"board certification\" - their boards and physician boards aren't even in the same galaxy. \n\nIf this sub does one useful thing, it's increasing awareness of the issue - and it's a HUGE issue.

Make your life easier and eat fewer calories (one oft recommended way of doing so is by tracking your calories using an app like MyFitnessPal. You can do whatever you want, but there is definitely a lot of value to tracking your calories - you will likely find you eat more calories than you thought you did).\n\nYou cannot spot-reduce fat. You will lose fat however your body decides it wants to. However, you will have an overall decrease in your fat stores, and since part of your fat is stored in your belly, that will be used over time as well.\n\nYou can answer most of the rest of your questions using the faq or the faq in /r/fitness (could've done this one too, but I like talking about this stuff, so it was fun for me to write).

Paleo is really not focuses on weight loss - sure, you can lose weight on paleo, but that's hardly the point. Instead, paleo is focused on changing what you put in your body so you are healthier overall - less inflammation (e.g.. in my case, I'm under 25 but have severe gastritis and intestinal issues), more fiber, etc. Part of this involves eating vegetables,  and eating them in significant amounts. It's non-negotiable in paleo, while in keto it seems kind of pushed to the wayside (I'd like to point out here that I know keto is supposed to have vegetables.

Safety razors certainly work on it, but it'll probably take you a little more time to figure out exactly how to shave with whatever razor you decide to use. A good starting razor (and the one I still use) is anything in the Edwin Jagger de89 series (There's just cosmetic differences between the different models in the series, from what I gather). \n\nAs you noted, your hair is definitely less likely to get stuck between blades because there is just 1 blade. This is a good time to bring up how exactly cartridge razors V safety/straight razors work. Cartridge razors need multiple blades b/c 1 blade is used to actually pull the hair while the other blades cut. You have probably noticed that your face is stupidly irritated after you shave, and this is pretty much why. Imagine if your barber pulled all your hairs before cutting them off --> your head would not be very happy. I think (and I'm guessing) the reason your hairs get stuck so easily in the cartridge is, at least in part, because the blade focused on pulling the hair makes it easier for the hair to get stuck in the cartridge itself after it's cut.\n\nIn contrast, safety/straight razors slice right through the hair. Part of the pleasure derived from using a safety/straight (I'd suggest starting with a safety aka double edge razor...no real potential to kill yourself) is you can actually *hear* your hairs being sliced when you cut properly. A lot of darker skinned people tend to have thicker hair and tend to get loads of razor burn with cartridge razors, but after learning to properly wetshave with a SR or DE, can shave with minimal to no razor burn.\n\nDisclaimer: Does this sound too good to be true? Well, it's not. However, learning to wetshave is a *skill*. You will not immediately be good at it...in fact, the first time, you'll probably do ok or suck. You might do ok because hey, those guys on the internet said you best be very careful and so you were. If you did ok, you'll figure \"hey, I know what I'm doing, fe_2plus_man is a moron. This is easy\". You'll then most likely get more reckless on the 2nd shave and end up with tons of cuts and razor burn.\n\nThis is ok. It is totally normal and part of the learning process. Shit, it took me like a year to learn (I was shaving like every 2 weeks like 8 months, which is an awful idea. Not only is it harder to shave when you have more hair, but how will you ever learn? After I started shaving ~every day, I got MASSIVELY better). Point is, you can't give up at the first sign of adversity and go back. The technique, the tools, the time required are all VERY different from the shaving your used to. That is ok (in fact, it's preferred). Because as you learn, and you get better, you'll start to find something funny...you actually begin to *look forward* to your shaves. My daily shave ritual is one of the high points of my day, every day. And let me tell you, after I exit the bathroom in the morning, I feel like a *man*. Is it irrational? Sure. But doesn't make it any more awesome. Keep practicing, look up questions you have on /r/wicked_edge (because I guarantee someone will have asked it and it'll have been answered) or post it to see the answers you get. Before you know it, you'll be stroking your face in the middle of a meeting as you consider whether your next shaving cream will be [TOBS Avocado](http://www.amazon.com/Taylor-Old-Bond-Street-Avocado/dp/B001L6X522) or [Proraso's Eucalyptus cream](http://www.amazon.com/Proraso-Eucalyptus-Menthol-Shaving-Cream/dp/B000VD9OSU/ref=sr_1_24?s=hpc&ie=UTF8&qid=1358222756&sr=1-24&keywords=shaving+cream). That's when you know you're hooked =)\n\nAnyway, that's my essay for you. Sorry for the wall of text, I swear when I started I wasn't going to write so much. However, I have actually fallen in love with shaving and really enjoy talking about it. Please peruse /r/wicked_edge we really are awesome over there.\n\nAlso, one more thing! Buy [Leisureguy's guide to gourmet shaving](http://www.amazon.com/Leisureguys-Guide-Gourmet-Shaving-Enjoyable/dp/1477436804). It's worth more than you'll pay for it.  He discusses literally *everything* when it comes to a beginners approach to shaving. Shit, I'm not even a beginner and I still consult it --> it's an awesome resource regardless of your skill level.\n\nThat's all for now.

I'm currently too broke to purchase another razor, so I've been sticking with my EJ89 (my first razor). I bought a lovely [sample pack](http://www.westcoastshaving.com/Sample-Packs_c_1.html) from west coast shaving a while back and have been going through the razors since then. I'm using a \"playoff\" method to determine what my favorite blade is.\n\n1st round: Do I like you or not? Put all the \"nots\" off in the losing pile. Winners advance to round 2.\n\n\n2nd round: Do I *really* like you? Basically, try to filter down the remaining blades to at most~ 1/2 of what I started this round with.\n\n            \n3rd round: Most likely going to be the last round. Figure out the 1-2 blades that treat you best, and order whichever one is cheaper.\n\nI'm at around the end of round 1 right now, and it's treated me pretty well. The only downside to this method is I've gotten WAY better at shaving since I started, so it's entirely possible that some of the blades in my \"round 1 losers\" pile would actually have been good but I kept cutting myself with them because my technique sucked. Oh well! One day when I buy a new razor I'll get to try them again =)\n\nI definitely agree with you on Sharks though, so far both Shark types have been great for me. I have also loved Feather and the Merkur double stainless so far.\n\nThere have been a lot of good reviews of the Merkur slant bar, although that has ceased to be made. My beard hair is pretty coarse, so I think it may be a good 2nd razor for me. I'm probably just going to hit the thrift store on occasion and hope to get lucky enough to find one.\n\nI'm jealous off all the razors you've tried! Then again, it sounds like you might come down with a serious case of RAD soon, so it's probably better I'm not in your shoes =)", "created_utc": "1358200127.0", "edited": "False", "id": "c7wwky0", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_16k16g", "parent_id": "t1_c7ww68p", "score": "9", "subreddit": "BuyItForLife", "subreddit_id": "t5_2ss1q"}, {"author": "fe_2plus_man", "body": "For anyone reading this, it's worth pointing out that just because it worked great for drzowie, it won't necessarily work great for you. Finding the right razor + blade combo for *your* face is a very YMMV thing. For example, with that particular razor, Astra's may leave me with a really shitty shave even though they give drzowie a great one. On the other hand, [Feather's](http://www.amazon.com/Feather-Hi-Stainless-Platimum-Double-Blades/dp/B0022R947O/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1358196564&sr=8-1&keywords=feather+razor+blades) may treat me extraordinarily well even though they completely chop up your face when you use them with the Merkur shown. Point is, to figure out what works for you, you have to experiment. However, after you figure out a good razor + blade combo, you can get blades for pennies on the dollar if you shop around and also start to enjoy your shave.\n\nShameless plug for www.reddit.com/r/wicked_edge - thanks to them, I can now shave like a real man. Ladies, if you're interested in shaving your limbs/pubic area/armpits/whatever else, wetshaving will work great for you too!

Thanks to justinguitar, I can practice for 15/day and still slowly but surely get better, which is awesome. I really enjoy being able to play an instrument, even though I suck at it right now.
