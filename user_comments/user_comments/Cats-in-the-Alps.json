I'd say having the proper equipment makes your life so much easier, before this tank I had tried budget systems like diy co2 and cheapo lights but those just make it so much harder to do anything. Absolutely essential in my opinion is having a high quality light like mine (wrb2 chihiros) and a pressurised co2 system, no diy stuff, both on timers. All the other stuff wasn't really needed like ADA tank and stand, lily pipes, inline heater and co2 diffuser, but I do think those really add to the viewing pleasure. Definitely don't need to drop 2k, all my equipment probably came in under 1k AUD, unless you are getting a bigger tank, I got my ADA tank and stand second hand for $200. \n\nRegards to maintaining it. I spent about 1-2 hours every Sunday to keep it in perfect condition. %50 water change, razer blade along all the glass, rocks scrubbed with toothbrush, and clean lily pipes and filter pipes if they needed it. Then maybe once a month give it a trim. I'd say it was worth it, 1-2 hours isn't a lot of time per week, just listen to a podcast while doing it and it's no that bad. My advice would be to make water changes as easy as possible, no buckets manually lifting water in to the aquarium, I did that in the past and that's the easiest way to make sure you'll skip on water changes. I have a hose that connects to the tap in my ensuite 2 meters away, so I'd fill about one bucket with gravel vac, dump it outside, then connect the hose to the sink and put it in the tank it let it fill up hands free. \n\nAlso do lots of research on the plants you'll keep, even if you think you know them they have lots of nuances.
