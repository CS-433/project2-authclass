They hadn't done anything with them for a few years and then suddenly they noticed construction on them. Somebody was building on their property without their permission, flat out putting pools in and buildings and everything. The police were no help, no lawyer would take it, town hall was deaf. It was obvious that the people doing this were part of organized crime intricately tied into the government. . I don't remember if death threats were involved, but they were hardly necessary since this family had no way to fight back.
