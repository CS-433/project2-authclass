The DSM is from 2017. But more generally, with computer classification. If the point density of the LiDAR isn\u2019t high enough objects like that might not be picked up fully (or at all) and you\u2019d have stray points in the final point cloud from a few occasional points hitting an object but not enough to capture the whole shape, even if they were stationary. If they are picked up with a decent amount of definition, you could use some kind of computer processing to categorise the point cloud. Telling a human from a car (from a tree from a lamp post etc) would depend at its most simplest on shape and size of individual features within the whole point cloud, amongst other geometric characteristics. There are also different \u201creturns\u201d in LiDAR, so basically how quickly the light returns to the sensor. The top of a building will return a reading quicker than the ground, for example. Returns are also used to categorise data, and may be useful depending on context. These kinds of objects are usually filtered and removed from a point cloud before processing into a DSM, as you only want the actual surface in such a model. A tightly packed crowd/queue, however, would make that even more difficult. Achieving all this depends greatly on the point density and target. How you process a city is different to processing a forest.

I was at a hostel having a grand old time, drinking lots over dinner. We were having babootie (google it if you don't know it, it's amazing) and I must've taken a bit too much without realising, but it pretty much just slipped into my throat before i'd even chewed any. Completely blocked it. So i'm quitely coming to the realisation that I am seriously choking. Couldn't even cough or anything. Sitting at a table surrounded by heaps of people, all laughing and drinking to themselves completely oblivious that I am having a minor but genuine face-to-face meeting with the eternal nothing. Kind of surrealy really. A Belgian girl across and few people up from me must've noticed and tapped her friend on the shoulder and pointed, they both started looking concerned and were about to get up and get help when it suddenly dislodged and just went right down my throat like some kind of water bird. I will never forget that feeling, like swallowing a damn golf ball. It *hurt*. You know that video of the girl swallowing a whole stick of butter like a complete fucking dumbass with no sense of self-preservation? I swear it looked like that, and things like that are still so triggering for me tbh. Gave the Beglian girls a nod and a wave and we both kinda laughed off the brief fear and adrenaline and went back to a killer night. Still cook babootie at home to this day lol.\n\nI also aspirated some rose milk tea when I was in Malaysia. It had this weird consistency where it was almost like air because it was so soft and bubbly, so when I took a sip through the straw the ol' throat interchange didn't know which route to send it I guess and I breathed some in. Coughed my guts up in the back corner of this outdoor restaurant for about 5 minutes and managed to clear it. This was more like drowning as I could still kind of gasp for breath but it just felt like I was getting nothing and making things worse. Honestly scarier, knowing it wasn't completely blocked but I still couldn't breath. Not the greatest first experience with rose-flavoured things. Also one of those moments when I started questioning if my partner at the time (now ex, thankfully) was actually a decent person as he kinda just watched and continued to not accept it was actually that serious any time I mentioned it (I doubt this one was actually able to kill me, but still, it was scary and he showed no care just kinda.... watched).\n\nI also choked on a hard-boiled lolly when I was away on a family trip while very young (can't actually remember, but probably left an imprint on my brain) and my dad just grabbed my feet and swung me upside down and smacked it out of me. \n\nStarting to think travelling makes me forget how to eat...\n\nSo I can relate to how silly yet terrifying this was, OP. Glad you're okay, sounds like a close one. It really is so easy to die.

Moved into a new house back in 2019 and the first few nights we started hearing desperate meows and something occasionally munching on my cats food. Woke up a few times to crying under the back verandah or at the back door. Eventually we managed to get near this tiny black cat that was a few months old at best, without her darting off. She was still very small. She looked absolutely atrocious, the poor thing. She was clearly comfortable inside the house, just not with us, and wouldn't leave the yard. So figured pretty quickly she was left there by the previous tenants, who'd moved out weeks before we moved in. My ex MIL fell in love with her and took her in (after I invited her over and cooked her a delicious breakfast with the sole intention of convincing her to take this abandoned cat lmao). She went from mangy and raggedy to one of the most beautiful cats I've ever seen, inside and out, and very quickly too. Honestly wish I'd kept her myself, such a friendly personality (compared to my asocial and honest kinda weird cat, whom I love but is.... weird). Also she turned out to be a male but we didn't learn that until a year later until an awkward \"tummy scritches\" experience for me, and she has a very petite and feminine energy so she's our girl still. This also happened to me previously in 2013 when I first moved to the city, an even more raggedy and beaten ginger cat hung around my front door for weeks, fed him up and eventually got someone to take him to a new home too. \n\nMoral of this long story; people suck, animals don't (even cats, as long as you desex them and keep them inside).
