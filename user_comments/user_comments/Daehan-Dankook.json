It's an online text parser that takes a Korean sentence and translates and diagrams it out for you.\n\nSecond, people like to say Korean is subject-object-verb, and generally it is, but there are other ways to look at it that I think are more helpful as you get to composing slightly more complex sentences.  I like to think of it as:\n\n1. The predicate always comes last\n2. The topic comes before the comment\n3. Modifiers come before the thing they modify\n\nThe predicate is the main, conjugated action verb, adjective (\"descriptive verb\"), or noun+\uc774\ub2e4.  You can re-arrange the rest of the sentence as long as it's properly marked with particles, but the predicate still has to go last.\n\nThe topic (marked with \uc740 or \ub294) is the \"topic of discourse\" or *the thing you are talking about*, which may or may not be the grammatical subject of the verb.  Often, it can be translated as an introductory phrase followed by a comma, like \"As for X,...\" or \"When it comes to Y,...\" In a topic-comment sentence, you establish a topic, then you make some kind of complete statement about it, which can have its own subject and object.  A simple expression with a separate topic and subject would be \"\ubbfc\uc9c0 \uc528\ub294 \ud0a4\uac00 \ucee4\uc694\". A good English translation is \"Miss Minji is tall\", but what it's literally saying is \"As for Miss Miji (her) stature is big\".  Miji is the topic, the person I am telling you about.  \ud0a4 is a noun that means \"height\" and it is the subject of the adjective \ud06c\ub2e4.  It is the thing that is being big.\n\nModifiers are an important way to make more complex sentences.  There are ways to use all kinds of words or even whole sentences in front of a noun to describe that noun.  A simple example would be something like \uac15\uc544\uc9c0\uac00 \uadc0\uc5ec\uc6cc\uc694 (subject-predicate) means \"The puppy is cute\", but \uadc0\uc5ec\uc6b4 \uac15\uc544\uc9c0 means \"the cute puppy\".  \n\nPutting it all together, here's a somewhat more complex sentence:\n\n\uc5ec\ub984\uc5d0\ub294 \uc80a\uc740 \uc0ac\ub78c\ub4e4\uc774 \ud574\uc218\uc695\uc7a5\uc5d0 \uac00\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \uc88b\uc544\ud574\uc694.\n\nIt means: \"In the summer, young people **like** going to the beach\". Or literally \"Summer-in-\\[topic\\], young people-\\[subject\\] beach-to go-ing thing-\\[object\\] like-polite.\n\nThe topic is summertime.  The comment about it is that young folks like going to the beach in that time of year.  The basic SOV elements are \"young people\" (subject, noun with an adjective modifying it) \"the thing of going-to-the-beach\" (object, using a verb or whole sentence to modify the special noun \"thing\" turns the whole sentence into a noun that can be the object), and \"like\" (predicate)\n\nI hope that helps!\n\nEdit: Somehow I forgot to put the word \"like\" in \"young people like going to the beach\".

I've done my best to explain how learning the *sound and meaning* of the hanja helps me (and plenty of other foreign learners) remember and understand the words that we learn.  Koreans don't need hanja for this, because they (you?) are already good at speaking and understanding Korean.  Foreigners need all the help that we can get.  I don't bother learning to write the actual hanja characters from memory, because that doesn't help me speak or understand Korean, and the extent to which I can passively recognize a maybe a couple hundred characters and type them on a computer (which always displays the \uc74c\ud6c8 next to the \uc790 in the candidate list) is mostly a happy accident.\n\nTo give one more example of what I'm trying to say, it is enough to know that \"\uc678\uad6d\uc778\" is made from \"outside \uc678\" \"country \uad6d\" \"person \uc778\" (to be honest I don't even bother learning the proper \uc74c\ud6c8) without learning how to read or write \"\u5916\u570b\u4eba\" without a computer. Remembering that the word for foreigner is \"outside country person\" is *so much* easier than just remembering \"*waygoogin*\" as just some random sounds, and it opens the door to more easily remembering other words made from the same hanja, like \ud574\uc678, \uad6d\ubbfc, and \uc778\uc0dd.  Remember, every foreign learner of Korean grew to adulthood without knowing a single goddamn word of Korean, and is now trying so hard to learn thousands and thousands of them.  Anything that helps make connections between related words is helpful.\n\nI also told the story of \uae30\ub9b0 to show the limitations of this approach.  \"\u9e92\u9e9f\" doesn't mean anything to me because \"\u9e92\" and \"\u9e9f\" aren't in any other words that I need to learn, so I invented \"\uae38\u4eba\" instead, and that's actually helpful for remembering how to say \"giraffe\".  I coudn't be arsed to learn how to handwrite \"\u9e92\u9e9f\" if you offered me a steak dinner and a hundred dollars.  Those characters are useless for Korean, and are useless to write anything but \"giraffe\" or \"Chinese unicorn\" (or apparently \"*wunderkind*\", which is \"\u9e92\u9e9f\u5152\") in Chinese, and they seriously look like shit.  Giraffes are not worth that kind of effort effort.\n\nAnyway, I'm so sorry that you feel so angry about hanja I hope your heart finds peace, but you've brought nothing but negativity to this thread.

Korean is already hard. Why make it harder?*\n\nAre you saying that I am too \ucd08\uae09 to be entitled to an opinion?\n\n*You might be on to something here.  I speak sub-elementary school level Korean and even less Chinese.  I know maybe 3,000 words of Korean, of which I can maybe remember 300 of the wrong ones on any given day.  But I'm learning every day.  I try not to speak above my level of expertise, but I think I'm entitled to share what has and hasn't been helpful in my own experience as a curious adult learner.  And so far, every hanja I have learned (yes, the hanja that I recognize are elementary.  They're also common because the are in elementary words that are useful for \ucd08\ubcf4\uc790 like me to know) has made Korean* **more** *transparent to me, not less.  If I hit a wall at some point and it starts being counterproductive to bother with them, I'll start telling people \"Yo, the first 500 hanja I learned really helped me improve my vocabulary, but then it got counterproductive so I stopped.\"  But it hasn't happened yet.  If anything, it's been the other way around.*\n\nPostscript: Do you want to know about my favorite Korean eggcorn?  I made it myself.  So I learned that \ucf54\ub07c\ub9ac, an indigenous Korean word, is composed from \ucf54, \uae38\ub2e4, and the nominalizing suffix \uc774.  I said \"*That's fucking amazing, 'long-nose-ee'*\" and never forgot how to say \"elephant\" again after that.  Sometime after that, I learned that \uae30\ub9b0 is \u9e92\u9e9f.  I took one look at that tragic mess of 'deer-basket-deer-rice-moon-whatever' and the sad little note next to \u9e92 that said 'Only used in qilin', and said \"*Lol nope. Those are the first and second stupidest goddamn hanzi I've ever seen and only a gobshite idiot or an insightful pre-modern literatus with no other cultural point of reference would think that beast looks like a Magic Chinese Dragon Unicorn*\" so I re-analyzed it as \"\uae38-\u4eba\" and said *\"Heh heh heh it's not kirin, it's 'longboi'!\"*. AND I NEVER FORGOT HOW TO SAY \"GIRAFFE\" AGAIN EITHER.  So am I doing it wrong?  Should I stop?\n\nEdits: fixed markdown for italic formatting.

They are Korean words that are assembled from \u6587\u8a00\u6587 components in a Chinese-ish manner.  The Latin words in English are also frequently Bad French and Bad Latin, but it doesn't matter.  \n\nIf you are learning English, you don't need to know how to use *commodus* in Latin or *commode* in French.  But as you build your vocabulary it becomes very advantageous to understand that \"commodious\" (spacious and comfortable), \"accommodation\" (a place of lodging, or an act of fitting something to one's needs) and a \"commode\" (a toilet) are all Latin-English words that have to do with \"comfort\" or \"convenience\".\n\nLikewise, \ud3b8\ud558\ub2e4 (\u4fbf\ud558\ub2e4), \ud3bc\ub9ac (\u4fbf\u5229), \ub0a8\ud3b8 (\u7537\u4fbf), \ud3b8\uc758\uc810 (\u4fbf\u5b9c\u5e97), and \ubcc0\uae30 (\u4fbf\u5668) are all related through \u4fbf's meaning of \"convenience\" or \"ease\".\n\nWhen you first start learning Korean, one reason it is difficult is that every new word you learn is completely opaque with no connection to other words.  \ud3b8\uc758\uc810 is just some random combination of mouth sounds, \"*pyun-ee-jom*\" where you can go buy snacks, and you just have to memorize it.  But as you get even a little bit more advanced, if you pay attention, you start to see that hanja words are made out of building blocks and recognize those building blocks when they appear.  A \ud3b8\uc758\uc810 is some kind of \uc810 (\u5e97, \"store, place, joint\") that has to do with \ud3b8 (\u4fbf, \"convenience\").  A convenience store!  It's so much easier to remember if you understand the building blocks.  And if know what a \ud3b8\uc758\uc810 and a \uc800\uc810 (\u66f8\u5e97) are, you'll probably guess exactly what an \uc74c\uc2dd\uc810 (\u98ee\u98df\u5e97) the first time you hear it.  And if you know what the \uc2dd in \uc74c\uc2dd means, you'll have no trouble remembering \uc2dd\uc0ac (\u98df\u4e8b), \uc2dd\ud0c1 (\u98df\u5353), and \ud6c4\uc2dd (\u5f8c\u98df).  And so on.\n\nSo for cases like OP who knows \"some\" Japanese and Chinese, he or she already knows some building blocks, just by different names.  That's a synergy, even if they don't make exactly the same words.  We don't have the Spanish word \"*amigo*\" in English, but it's easy to remember the first time you learn it, because we *do* have related words like \"amity\", \"amiable\" and \"amicus brief\" that also have to do with friendship.\n\nI agree that learning to read and write the actual \u5b57 is completely unnecessary for Korean (though every learner should probably know \uf981 and \u7537 by heart just in case you go someplace where the bathroom doors are \\*fancy\\*), and learning actual Chinese language is even more unnecessary.  But I think that even at a pretty elementary level it's useful to start learning the *Korean sound* and the *meaning* of common hanja.  And as you reach an intermediate level, where your vocabulary starts to become a bigger obstacle to comprehension and self-expression than your ability to string words together, I think hanja become even more important because they help you acquire whole families of related words.  This isn't \"studying hanja\" in the way Korean people think of it (drilling the characters).  It's studying *Korean* using all the tools available with the intention of building a more intuitive understanding.\n\nEdit: spelling", "created_utc": "1659463796.0", "edited": "1659477195.0", "id": "iioa6fi", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_wdzebx", "parent_id": "t1_iinv0sm", "score": "6", "subreddit": "Korean", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rd8q"}, {"author": "Daehan-Dankook", "body": "> **\uc804\ubb38\uac00**\ub4e4\uc740 **\ucd5c\uadfc \uace0\ubb3c**\uac00, **\uace0\uae08\ub9ac**\uc5d0 \ub530\ub978 **\uacbd\uae30 \uce68\uccb4 \uc6b0\ub824**\uac00 **\uc2ec\ud654**\ub41c \uac00\uc6b4\ub370 **\ud55c\uad6d\uc740\ud589**\uc758 **\ucd94\uac00 \uae08\ub9ac \uc778\uc0c1**\uc774 **\ubd88\uac00\ud53c\ud568**\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c **\uc8fc\ud0dd \uc2dc\uc7a5**\uc758 **\uac70\ub798 \uc808\ubcbd \uc0c1\ud0dc**\ub294 **\ub2f9\ubd84\uac04 \uc9c0\uc18d**\ub420 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \ubcf4\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4.\n\nThat\u2019s a random sentence from a random [news article on Daum](https://news.v.daum.net/v/20220802084842823) with all of the \ud55c\uc790\uc5b4 in bold.

As in, \"the girl who teaches you to tie your hanbok and do your hair prettily\" is a different relationship from \"the girl who helps Mother manage the house while you study for examination to become a government official\".  By comparison, the term for younger sibling, \ub3d9\uc0dd (from \u540c\u751f, meaning \"same birth\") is gender neutral unless you specify \"male \ub3d9\uc0dd\" or \"female \ub3d9\uc0dd\", while modern Chinese has a four-way split between older brother, younger brother, older sister, and younger sister, but no distinction between whether the speaker is male or female.\n\nI don't know why Korean developed the particular way that it did, but as far as I know there are no East Asian languages that have a universal system of grammatical gender like Roman languages do.  And gender in Roman languages is a simplification of Latin's noun system where words could be any of three genders and five \"declensions\", meaning there were many different \"kinds\" of nouns that each would have a different set of \"case endings\" to show what they were doing in the sentence.  Korean nouns just don't really come in different kinds like that, and the particles you add to them to show their role in the sentence either never change or only change for ease of pronunciation depending on whether the noun ends with a consonant or vowel.\n\nAlso, the words \ud615, \ub204\ub098, \uc624\ube60, and \uc5b8\ub2c8 aren't all ancient, and they haven't always had the same four-way distinction.

People can basically spell their names however they want.  \"Mun\" is the modern spelling of \"\ubb38\", but for example the previous president of South Korea, \ubb38\uc7ac\uc778 spells his name \"Moon Jae-in\" in English.  It's pronounced like \"moon\" as in \"the moon\".\n\nSomething to know is that Korean names are made from Chinese characters, and are normally a one-syllable family name, followed by a two-syllable given name.  Moon Jae-in is \"President Moon\" to the public or \"Jae-in\" to his best friend.  Most Chinese characters aren't fully words on their own.  They're more like building blocks, like Greek and Latin roots are in English.  One meaning of \"mi\" (\ubbf8) is indeed the Chinese character \u7f8e, which means \"beatiful\". So you're you're unlikely to meet somebody named \"Mi\", but you'll see it as part of many feminine names, like Mi-kyung (official romanization Mi-gyeong) or Mi-young (official romanization Mi-yeong).  For a male equivalent many names like Min-jun include \"jun\" or \"joon\" (\uc900), which can represent  \u4fca which means \"talented\" or \"handsome\".\n\nAs a caution, Koreans don't think about the Chinese meanings of names all the time, just like we don't always think about \"Theodora\" meaning \"gift from God\" in Greek.  Parents often choose a name for their child based on the sound they want rather than any particular meaning, then chose Chinese characters with the same pronunciation that have a good meaning together.  \n\nNative Korean names are an exception to this, and are a growing trend but still a small minority of common names.

It isn't always obvious with Mandarin and Japanese, since their pronunciations have changed a lot since ancient times, but sometimes Korean and South-Chinese languages like Cantonese are especially close.  Consider the word for \"student\", \u5b78\u751f.  It's the same \"word\" in each language; everybody agrees that it's a Chinese-based word composed of parts that mean \"learn\" and \"born\" which are represented by those particular Chinsese characters, but each language pronounces it according to their own rules, *xu\u00e9sh\u0113ng* in Mandarin, *hok6 saang1* in Cantonese, *gakusei* in Japanese, and *haksaeng* in Korean.  In Chinese, \u5b78 *xu\u00e9* is also the basic verb for \"learn\", but Korean and Japanese have indigenous words for this, *baeuda* and *manabu,* that follow native conjugation patterns and don't have anything to do with \"xue\" or \"gaku\" or \"hak\" at all even though \"manabu\" is *also* written with the simplified form of the character \u5b78.\n\nSo what's all this useful for?  I think knowing even a little bit about Chinese and how its words are constructed can demystify some things about Japanese and Korean.  Beginners in Japanese get really confused about *kunyomi* and *onyomi* readings of *characters*, because they aren't really trained to think in terms of *words* being *native Japanese* or *Sino-Japanese* instead.  And if you know a lot of vocabulary in one language, you can transfer much of it to the others quite easily.  \n\nHowever, I *don't* think there's much to gain from being a beginner in all three.  Pick the one you're most interested in, and get learning.  You can revisit the others when you're advanced enough to take advantage of they synergies between them instead of be distracted.", "created_utc": "1651941669.0", "edited": "False", "id": "i7p08bl", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_uk267n", "parent_id": "t3_uk267n", "score": "1", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "Daehan-Dankook", "body": "I think the simplest way to think of this is that, in Korean, it is not \"you\" who are \"hungry\" (experiencing a psychological sensation of hungriness), but your stomach (being all achey and rumbly for lack of food). \n\nColloquially, Koreans do use \ubc30\uace0\ud504\ub2e4 like a single verb, as in, \"\uc5c4\ub9c8! \ub098 \ubc30\uace0\ud30c\\~\\~!\" *\"Mom!

Dutch and the Scandinavian languages do pretty poorly here, since they are spoken in small countries without huge media industries where people generally know English well and switch to it at the first sign of trouble.

It doesn't take long, and it will set you on the path to success for two really good reasons:\n\n1. First, learning hangul is how you **learn the pronunciation system** of Korean.  Korean uses fewer sounds overall than English does, but some are a little tricky for English-speakers.  For example, depending on the romanization system you use, the letter \u3131 can be represented as \"g\" or \"k\", but it isn't quite either.  You don't engage your voice box as you do when you pronounce \"g\" as in \"gun\", but you don't produce a puff of air like you do when you pronounce \"k\" as in \"kiss\" either.  Romanization can't hurt you if you already know how to pronounce Korean, but *Romanization can't teach you accurate pronunciation*.  You're far better off learning the Korean sounds, just as they are and without connecting them to English, at the same time as the letters that represent them.\n\n2. Secondly, and this is important, **everything in Korean is written in hangul**.  This includes learning materials.  The universe of resources that use romanization is tiny, and they are not always good resources.  Most textbooks, work books, graded readers, video captions and teacher's scribbles on the whiteboard are all in hangul.  \n\nOkay, so how do you learn hangul?  Honestly I read the Wikipedia page about it and then mashed the \"practice\" button on Duolingo until I could read, but that's a terrible idea.  Don't do that.  Start with some YouTube videos that explain the letters and sounds together.  Here are a few good playlists by wonderful teachers who will start with hangul and then take you much, much father:\n\n[Learn Korean with GO!

That is, it shows that whatever it is attached to is the *thing that is doing something*.  The subject marker tends to show up when introducing something new to the conversation, when asking and answering concrete things like \"wh\" questions, and in subordinate clauses.\n\nThe topic particle, \uc740 or \ub294, marks something as the *topic of discourse* of the **sentence** or **conversation**.  That is, it shows that something is *the thing you are going to talk about*.  When something is the topic, you can frequently translate it as an introductory phrase followed by a comma, such as \"As for ...,\" or \"When it comes to ...,\".  This is a more zoomed-out level of organization than subject/object/verb agreement is, and the \"comment\" that follows the topic can be a complete sentence with its own subject, and object, or even a complex sentence with multiple verbs that each have their own subject.  The topic marker tends to show up when making comparisons, steering the conversation back to something the listener has already heard of in order to say something new about it, and making general statements.\n\nIn very simple sentences the same thing is both frequently the topic of the sentence and the subject of the verb (and you have to pick one particle or the other), but it doesn't have to be.  The pattern \"As for X, the Y is Z\" is very common in Korean.  You see it even in very beginner sentences like \uc800\ub294 \ud0a4\uac00 \ucee4\uc694 \"As for me, the height is large\".  It is my stature that is being \"large\", but the whole thing is a statement about me, so you can understand it as a Korean way of saying \"I am tall\".

For one thing, they excluded pitch *which is an intrinsic part of pronunciation in Chinese* and distinguishes many words that would otherwise be homophones.  For another, most individual characters have only one pronunciation in standard Mandarin so from that perspective the orthography is very transparent, but the usual problem with reading Chinese is that *you either know a character or you don't*.

And most of all, they share vocabulary.  This is an extremely useful synergy **if you already know a lot of words** and understand well how Chinese or and Sino-xenic words are constructed.  However, if you're a beginner, I think it's much less useful.  The most basic words are usually unrelated between the two languages, because Sino-Korean words tend to be \"fancier\" like French, Latin and Greek words in English, while the grammatical function words and the basic nouns, adjectives, and verbs that describe everyday life are native-Korean and not from Chinese.  The relationships between related Mandarin and Korean words also aren't as obvious as they could be, because Mandarin pronunciation has diverged very far from Middle Chinese in many ways.  Sino-Korean words are pronounced much more similarly to Cantonese, which has much more conservative pronunciation.  For example, \u5b78\u751f (\"student\") is *haksaeng* in Korean.  It's *hok6 saang1* in Cantonese, but *xu\u00e9sh\u0113ng* in Standard Mandarin.  Lastly, Korean is normally written nowadays in the Korean alphabet with only limited use of Chinese characters.  This makes Korean much easier to read and pronounce, but hides some of the underlying structure.  You wouldn't necessarily read \ud559\uc0dd and understand that it's \"\u5b78\u751f\" unless you already knew that \ud559 is a root that means \"learning\" and \uc0dd is a root that means \"born\" or \"life\" and could connect them to a bunch of other words that also use them.\n\nLastly, you only have so much time every day and everything is a trade-off.

Why should it be more difficult to acquire Roman words or even Greek, rather than the vernacular? No doubt my prescription demands the environment of a cultivated home-circle. But the master may secure even under the conditions of school-life that boys be brought to speak Latin with precision, if patience be shown in encouraging and correcting uncertain efforts, and in insisting upon careful observation of the Teacher's own usage. By degrees devices for increasing fluency may be introduced; as, for instance, a game of forfeits and prizes for faults and corrections, the Master choosing the judges from amongst the top boys. The more common phrases suitable for play, for social life, for meal-times, must be early learned and be apt, and ready to hand. \n\nThen, begin to introduce formal study of the structure of the language and literature that illustrates it in real use.\n\n> The time will now have come when the able teacher must select certain of the more necessary rules of accidence and syntax, and state them simply, arrange them in proper order and dictate them for entry in note-books.

What makes it rude is using it to somebody you are *supposed* to be respectful to, either because they are in a higher position than you or you don't know them very well.\n\nDo be a little careful with the formal-nonpolite \ud55c\ub2e4 style (also known as \"plain form\"), though.  It's used all the time in impersonal writing like books and news articles, where it just has a matter-of-fact narrative feeling, but it's not used all that much in speaking because it's just as non-polite as \ud574 style but it isn't friendly either.  If you watch historical dramas, it's what the king usually speaks when he's angrily bossing his subjects around.

Every living language is the product of a continual process of evolution from the emergence of behavioral modernity in humans many tens or hundreds of thousands of years ago up to the last thing somebody said or wrote an instant ago.  In a way, they're all the oldest.  But most of that history happened a very long time before the invention of writing and is forgotten forever.\n\nWhere Sanskrit comes in is that it is the earliest *attested* form of an Indic language, meaning it is the oldest form (around 3,000 years ago, similar to Ancient Greek) that we can study directly because it has been preserved in writing until the present day.  Before that, people spoke something similar that was the predecessor of not just Sanskrit but also of the languages of Persia and Afghanistan, but it was either never written down or no writings have survived.  And before that, maybe 5,000 years ago, people somewhere on the Eurasian steppe were speaking something that was the common ancestor of Indian, Iranian, and most European languages.  We call it \"proto-Indo-European\", and there are no records of it but linguists can tell a lot about what it was like by comparing the sounds and vocabularies of all of its ancient and modern descendants that *were* written down.  And of course, PIE isn't the original form of anything either.  It's just the farthest back in time that we can see with the evidence that exists today.  If Indo-European eventually has a common ancestor with the other family groupings of languages that we know about (like Sino-Tibetan, Turkic, Austronesian, etc...) then it was so long ago that we can't really say anything about it with confidence.\n\nOn the other hand, after a lot of classical writings were written down in Sanskrit, Indian people's everyday ways of speaking and writing continued to change and diversify and were influenced by other languages like Persian and Arabic over the years, until they were quite distinct from the classical writings, and today we call those ways the modern languages of North India, like Hindi and Punjabi.  But because those classical writings were culturally important, people continued to study the classical form of language too.  The same thing happened in Europe.  The way people spoke Latin in Gaul and Hispania were influenced by different invaders and as grew as different from each other as they did from the writings of Cicero.  But people continued to write in the style of Cicero because it was prestigious, and when it became hard to communicate, they found it useful bridge the gap by talking more like Cicero too.  Eventually, as new kingdoms and countries emerged, people found it useful to call the classical style \"Latin\" and the everyday ways they talked (and eventually wrote) \"French\" and \"Spanish\" instead.\n\nSo, no living language is really \"older\" than any other, although some change less radically than others.  Modern Icelandic looks a lot more like Old Norse than Modern Norwegian does.  And in a funny way, preserved classical languages like Sanskrit, Latin, and Ancient Greek are actually \"younger\" than their modern descendants like Hindi, French, and Modern Greek.  They are frozen in the form that they took during the \"classical\" time period whose literature we value and whose style we imitate when we create new things in them, setting aside the thousands of years of natural development between then and today.", "created_utc": "1642468452.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ht46452", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_s656lh", "parent_id": "t1_ht3cnoa", "score": "7", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "Daehan-Dankook", "body": "\uace0\ub9c8\uc6cc. \uc2eb\uc5b4\uc0b0\ub2e4.", "created_utc": "1642369515.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hsyd3vf", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_s5bw24", "parent_id": "t3_s5bw24", "score": "1", "subreddit": "linguisticshumor", "subreddit_id": "t5_2vwiq"}, {"author": "Daehan-Dankook", "body": "And that's the perspective that I'm talking about.

Intended for self-learners.  Focused on idiomatic everyday speech (though the first level uses \ud558\uc2ed\uc2dc\uc624\uccb4 for most of the book before teaching \ud574\uc694\uccb4 in like the last lesson). Cheap; each book is just $10 on Kindle.\n\n*Cons:* Books are not dense; there is far more explanation than there is Korean to read or practice exercises to complete.  Depending on how far your class went, the three books might not go high enough for you.  You either like his jokey style or you don't.\n\n**College Korean** by Michael C. Rogers, Claire You, & Kyungnyun Richards\n\n*Pros:* Hardcore doorstop textbook from UC Berkeley in the early '90s.  Very densely packed with example sentences and practice exercises.  Focuses on grammar, idiomatic constructions as sentence building blocks and reading, less on conversation.  Includes far more formal and honorific speech and formal written-style \ud574\ub77c\uccb4 than other resources do.  Includes some hanja if you're into that sort of thing.  No illustrations or other fluff.  Motivates me to study hard.  I love it!  There's an Intermediate sequel (Intermediate College Korean by Claire You & Eunsu Cho) which I'm a few chapters away from from starting.\n\n*Cons:* Explanations are terse and jargony.  Intended for use in class though I find it very useful for self-study.  Early chapters are boring and mostly about school life, though things get livelier later on.  Some vocabulary is old-fashioned.  No illustrations or other fluff.  Expensive for a new copy.  Grab somebody's dogeared old one on Amazon Marketplace for like $10.\n\n**Korean from Zero** by George Trombley and some Korean ghostwriters\n\n*Pros:* Professionally done and modern.  Designed to make self-study painless for people who get bored easily.  I like the way they introduce certain verbs with their common expressions that they appear in.\n\n*Cons:* I didn't really like the style and only did the first of 3 levels.

This playlist starts from absolutely zero and teaches grammar and vocabulary using nothing but examples, context, body language, pictures, and very simple explanations in Korean using words he has already taught.  It's great!\n\n[Comprehensible Korean] (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxwSrFHHC3I9xFxrChfuqwA) - Short, fun videos teaching everyday vocabulary, usually illustrated with the creator's drawings.\n\n[KoreanBabo with Jemma] (https://www.youtube.com/c/KoreanBabowithJemma) - Lessons about common Korean expressions, grammar, and other topics, taught in more advanced (but very carefully enunciated) Korean with English (and usually hangul) subtitles.\n\nEdit: If you haven't learned to read hangul yet, all three channels teach that entirely in Korean too!

One thing that I find very slightly annoying is that some letters including \u314a have variations that would be different characters from each other in Chinese.  \n\nThe basic version of \u314a has four strokes and goes: \"dot, horizontal, left-falling, right-falling\".  The dot is usually a little bit of a dash (because of the way calligraphy brushes work) and can be either horizontal or vertical.  Sometimes the horizontal dash is elongated until the character almost looks like \u5929 (if the stroke at the top weren't connected to the rest of the character).\n\nIn print, the dot is often connected so it looks similar to  \u5927 , the Chinese character for \"big\" which has only three strokes and goes \"horizontal, left-falling, right-falling\", with the left-falling stroke starting above the horizontal to make the little dude's head as he spreads his arms and legs wide to be as \"big\" as he can.\n\nThen there's a version that's common in handwriting but is used in some printed fonts too, which has three strokes and goes \"dot, horizontal with a down-and-left hook (like a \u3131), right-falling\".  The final right-falling stroke branches off the hook instead of coming from the horizontal part.  This is way easier to write somewhat neatly in a cursive style than the standard, symmetrical way.\n\nIt doesn't take too long to get used to the variations with a little bit of practice.

Less offensively, \u5c71 is \ubafc \uc0b0 *\"moe san\"*.  \ubafc is a pretty uncommon word that means \"tomb\" instead of \"mountain\" nowadays and I probably didn't have to bother learning it.  Nevertheless, I think the system is helpful and interesting, and it also makes it very easy to talk *about* specific Chinese characters.  From what I understand, you can typically identify kanji by their kunyomi in Japanese, but it isn't a formalized system in the same way.\n\n> I am assuming this is some sort of comic.\n\nRight again.  In Korean it's \ub9cc\ud654\ucc45 *\"manhwa chaek\"*.  Manhwa is the same word as manga, and chaek is the common Sino-Korean noun for \"book\".  \n\nI think if there were no combined CJKV pages for characters and compound character-words in Wiktionary, and no hanja in dictionary entries, it would still be possible to learn Korean as a foreign language.  People manage to learn Vietnamese just fine.  But I think you can well see how much Sino vocabulary vocabulary carries over.  If you have a native or advanced learner background in Japanese or Chinese, it would be foolish *not* to put it to work through hanja.  Even if you don't (I dabbled in Chinese ages ago but never went very far in it), they're a powerful learning tool for Korean even if they aren't needed in everyday life.  Koreans deemphasize them for their own cultural reasons, but they don't need to emphasize them to be good at Korean.

It is for the Koreans, and we must engage with it the way that they use it and not (only) how we would like to use it.  But we don't need to break into vocabulary without knowing the structure.  We simply study hanja.  Most adult learners who get to a high level credit hanja study.  Learning to read and write the characters themselves is optional, but when learning a new word you can identify the underlying characters by their \u97f3\u8a13, which is a unique name or mnemonic that Korean gives to each character.  You can use that to explore families of related words to learn many new words from one new character.  In text, the morphophonemic (as opposed to purely phonemic) spelling makes hanja roots somewhat identifiable in context.  Known words are well identifiable and unknown words can be somewhat guessed at but with much less certainty than if the hanja were provided.  Is this better than the absolute meaning-clarity but sound-ambiguity of mixed script?  I don't know.  I find hanja very useful and see the downside to having them obscured behind another layer of abstraction, but I also know and use many Sino-Korean words for which I don't know the hanja at all, and others for which I'm aware of the hanja's sound and meaning but couldn't read or write it.  I would be completely illiterate in those words in Chinese or Japanese, or maybe would not know them at all.\n\n> limiting the access to the intellectual thought process of over 50% of the vocab\n\nIn my experience, educated Koreans have at least the same appreciation of \u6f22\u5b57\u8a9e that anglophones do of Latin and Greek roots.  Depending on when they went to school and what they studied, they may or may not be able to recognize or write many characters or pronounce them in Chinese.  They may not be interested in the hanja themselves at all.  But they instantly know which words are hanja words, know the meanings and Sino-Korean pronunciations of the constituent parts, and use them every day in speech and writing without difficulty.\n\nAgain, the point I want to emphasize is that emphasizing hangul over mixed script or \u6f22\u6587 in modern Korean is as much of a political decision as a practical one, but hangul meets Korean people's practical needs well enough.  There are indeed trade-offs.  You identified some, and we could argue all day about what those compromises are and what system would be optimal and for whom.  But ultimately it doesn't matter.  If you open a \u6f2b\u756b\u518a, the writing will be in hangul.  You'll see plenty of hanja around South Korea as shorthand, design elements, and for disambiguation in sophisticated texts (and plenty more written standard Chinese for the benefit of the many Chinese visitors) but not much in the body of regular text.

So I'll say this instead.\n\nKoreans use (and love) hangul because they are nationalists and it is an indigenous system that both meets their needs and lets them assert their independence from China (the cultural monolith and once and maybe-future hegemon), Japan (who brutally colonized Korea in the early-to-mid 20th century) and the west (who divided Korea in two, fought a brutal war over it, divided it again, and then filled it with exciting but oh-so-foreign ideologies as the two sides rebuilt both halves in their respective images.

The whole sentence is a comment on the topic of \u201ctoday\u201d, that describes what it\u2019s like compared to some other day. You\u2019ll see this kind of \u201cAs for X, the Y is Z\u201d sentence a lot in Korean. \n\nThere are tricks for choosing between the topic and subject markers in simple sentences, but a lot of it comes with experience and I don\u2019t think getting it exactly right is as important as a beginner as understanding that they do a different grammatical thing. \n\nAs for the \u201cI\u201d pronouns, technically \uc800 is *humble* while \ub098 is plain.

But you might see a superior use \ub098 while speaking politely to his subordinates because he wants to courteously raise them up without being humble himself. It\u2019s not recommended to speak this way as a learner, though. People would probably just assume it\u2019s a mistake.\n\nEdit: I would be careful with terms like \u201cmain subject\u201d and \u201cminor subject\u201d. Linguists and teachers use the terms \u201ctopic\u201d and \u201csubject\u201d respectively, and there\u2019s enough disagreement about what those mean already. It\u2019s true that topic-comment is on a more zoomed out level than subject-object-verb and that complex sentences often have one topic and several verbs which each have their own subject, but as a learner I find it more helpful to think of the topic and subject as doing different grammatical jobs.", "created_utc": "1635604027.0", "edited": "1635604562.0", "id": "hin9x7j", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_qj13mp", "parent_id": "t3_qj13mp", "score": "6", "subreddit": "Korean", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rd8q"}, {"author": "Daehan-Dankook", "body": "All translations have to strike a balance between accurately reflecting the literal words of the original source, and accurately conveying the *meaning* and *feeling* that those words evoke in the original language.

Billy Korean] (https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbFrQnW0BNMUkAFj4MjYauXBPtO3I9O_k) is also very well done and follows a similar philosophy (though most videos do have native speaker-recorded dialogues to listen to), but does NOT follow the same order as the books.\n\nI didn't love the *Korean from Zero* series and only did the first book, but it was well-designed \n\nTalk To Me in Korean's *Easy Korean Reading For Beginners* is lovely, as are all of their supplemental books.  Opinions vary on their core grammar textbooks and the (free) online core grammar curricula which cover the same material.\n\nOne you missed is *[Korean Stories for Language Learners] (https://www.amazon.com/Korean-Stories-Language-Learners-Traditional/dp/0804850038/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=korean+stories+for+language+learners&qid=1634346981&sr=8-1)* by Julie Damron and EunSun Cho.  It's a graded reader of stories from Korean folklore that goes from very, very elementary to progressively more sophisticated, with side-by-side translation, vocabulary, and comprehension questions for each story. And it is delightful.\n\nGood luck and \ud654\uc774\ud305!\n\nEdit: As for what to do first, learn the alphabet and the sounds that make up the Korean phonetic system together, and learn them before you do much of anything else.  Use audio resources recorded by Korean people.  Don't study using romanization (the Korean alphabet is easy, so there's no need to) and avoid associating Korean phonemes with their English equivalents.  \uac00 is not \"ga\" *or* \"ka\", it's just \uac00.  Some people insist you should avoid exposure to romanization at all or it will do Bad Things to you, but I think that's silly.  Once you know how to pronounce Korean, the Revised Romanization and McCune-Reischauer systems are just other (much worse) orthographies for reading and writing Korean, and you will encounter them sometimes.\n\nOnce you can kinda read and pronounce things, it would be a good idea to follow one or more structured beginner courses that find personally most helpful and motivating.

Billy is an American with a goofy influencer style and a gift for explaining things in a way that makes them fun and approachable, layered on top of what is actually a pretty old-school focus on grammar fundamentals.  His course has some examples dialogues recorded by native speakers in most lessons, but is aimed more at teaching and explaining with the expectation that you will find ways to practice on your own.  Prof Yoon is a native Korean, and really is a professor of Korean language at a university in the US.

It's not slang, but just a part of how Korean pronunciation works.  When a syllable has ending consonants (called \"batchim\" in Korean), the sounds like to blend with the next syllable in ways that almost always make the word easier to pronounce.  One of the most important \"batchim rules\" is that when the next syllable of the word begins with \u3147, the batchim consonant can become part of the next syllable where it's easier to say.  Google \"Korean batchim rules\" to learn more.\n\nFor a quick example of the same rule you just discovered, the word for \"light\" is \ube5b, which is pronounced \"bit\" when it's by itself.  The \u314a is kind of reduced to a choked \"t\" sound the way \u3137, \u314c, \u3145, \u314a, and \u3148 normally do at the end of a word.  But when you use \ube5b in a sentence and add the subject particle \uc774, \ube5b\uc774 is pronounced like \"\ube44\uce58\" or \"bi-chi\", with the full normal \u314a sound moved to the place of the \u3147 in the next syllable.

But they do not add the same nuance and they do not do the same thing grammatically.  \n\nThe subject particle (\uc774 or \uac00) tells you plain-and-simple that the noun is attached to is the *grammatical subject* of the verb.  That is, the subject is the thing that is doing something or being something.  Longer, more complex sentences with multiple verbs may have a different subject for each verb.  The subject particle emphasizes that the noun it's attached to is the new or important information, so it tends to show up when asking or answering a \"wh\" question or introducing something new to the conversation.\n\nThe topic particle (\uc740 or \ub294) is a little more conceptual.  The topic is the thing in focus that the rest of the sentence is a comment on.  That is, it's the *thing you are interested in talking about*.  A good way to think of the topic in some situations is as an introductory phrase followed by a comma, such as \"As for X, ...\" or \"Regarding X, ...\".  In simple sentences, the topic of the sentence is often also the subject of the verb, but it doesn't have to be.  It could also be the object, or the context we are talking about such as the time, place, or situation, and \"As for X, the Y is Z\" is a very common way to construct slightly more complex sentences.  The topic particle emphasizes that the description that comes after it is the new or important information, so it tends to show up when making general statements, changing the topic of the conversation, or implying some sort of comparison.\n\nFor example:\n\n\uae40\ubc25\uc774 \ub9db\uc788\uc5b4\uc694 \"The kimbap is delicious\"\n\n\uae40\ubc25\uc740 \ub9db\uc788\uc5b4\uc694 \"As for the KIMBAP, it's delicious (maybe something else wasn't)\" or \"Kimbap (in general) is delicious\"\n\nSince you mentioned negative sentences, \uc544\ub2c8\ub2e4 (and \ub418\ub2e4 \"to become\") are kind of special cases.  The thing that something is \"isn't\" gets the subject particle, and the thing that is \"not being\" that thing gets the topic particle.  If you like fancy grammatical terms, you can call the thing that gets the subject particle a \"complement\".  I think it's easier just to remember that the full sentence goes \ubbfc\uc9c0\ub294 \uc77c\ubcf8\uc0ac\ub9bc\uc774 \uc544\ub2c8\uc5d0\uc694 \"Minji is not a Japanese person\".  \uc77c\ubcf8\uc0ac\ub78c\uc774 \uc544\ub2c8\uc5d0\uc694 is \"[She] is not a Japanese person\".

Learning Korean as an anglophone, I'd say the hardest thing for me is just learning and retaining enough (extremely non-Indo European) vocabulary to express myself or understand what the hell anybody is saying, followed by keeping up with the social complexity of actually interacting in Korean (as you allude to).  Cultural \"fluency\" might be an issue, but I don't think cultural *interest* is a problem for most learners, who tend to either be really into hallyu stuff, or have a personal connection to Korea (or both).  \n\nAnd with just a little studying, getting a handle on Korean's agglutinative grammar has honestly been the least hard part.  It's arguably easier to include another morpheme for each piece of information you want to add than it is to learn a whole table of fusional endings in a European language.  The little \"-\u014d\" on a Latin verb stands for \"present active indicative first-person singular\" and you need to remember a whole different ending if you want to change even one of those parameters.  Now *that's* crazy.  And the vowel harmony in Korean is a nothingburger.  It's more like the vestiges of a much stricter system that existed in Middle Korean.  Native words tend to harmonize with themselves but don't always, and its not a thing in Sino-Korean or foreign loadwords at all.  Some descriptive words have dark and bright versions with different nuances.

That makes new fonts hard to build, but it also makes the possible combinations finite.

Korean has four common speech styles (and three more that are uncommon or old-fashioned) that show the speaker's relationship to the listener and the situation.  You can think of them as the four corners of a graph with two axes: formality and politeness.  Politeness is showing respect and distance toward the listener, while nonpoliteness indicates familiarity because you are either very close or high above the listener.  Formality adds \"fanciness\" to the situation, and can be polite or not.\n\nFormal-polite (\u3142\ub2c8\ub2e4/\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4) style: Used for being extra-respectful to people who are high above you, like your superior officer in the army, and for formal situations like like giving a presentation.  This is your \"professional\" voice.  It would be weird and off-putting to talk to your friends like this all the time, but outside of strictly formal situations you can mix it with \uc694 style for a bit of emphasis.  Expressions like \uac10\uc0ac\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4 and \uc8c4\uc1a1\ud569\ub098\ub2e4 are very polite \"fixed expressions\", so it's normal to say them in formal-polite style even in an informal conversation.\n\nInformal-polite (\uc5b4\uc694/\uc544\uc694) style: Used for most polite, everyday conversations between adults who are not close friends or family.  It's polite like \u3142\ub2c8\ub2e4 style, but friendly instead of fancy/standoffish and can be ether very slangy or quite \"proper\" depending on how you use it.  This is the style you are probably learning first, because it is the \"safest\" and most socially flexible.  This is your \"polite\" voice.\n\nInformal-nonpolite (\uc5b4/\uc544) style: This is \"\ubc18\ub9d0\" or \"casual speech\".  Used for speaking with close friends and family, in which case it's friendly and intimate, or for speaking to people who are far below you.  It would be quite rude and presumptuous to speak this way to someone of higher status without their permission.  This is your \"cheers, mate\" voice.\n\nFormal-nonpolite (\u3134\ub2e4/\ub294\ub2e4/\ub2e4) style: This is the \"plain form\".  How can something be formal but impolite?  Ask a jury summons or a wikipedia article?  Plain form is used all the time for impersonal writing like books, newspapers, and official documents that aren't written \"to\" anybody in particular, where it has an impartial \"just the facts\" feeling.  It's also used in speech within a few specific situations:\n\n1. Exclamations and self-talk - there's no need to be polite or friendly because you're not really talking \"to\" anybody but just blurting something out.  The original example was this situation.\n\n2. Embedded in some grammar forms like indirect quotations.  To say \"She said that it was difficult\", the \"It was difficult\" part would be in plain form inside of a sentence that states that \"She said\" something.\n\n3. You *can* use it in conversation, but it's not polite at all.  It's \ubc18\ub9d0 but less-friendly or even more rude than \uc5b4/\uc544 style.

Billy is a nonnative speaker, but a great teacher with a gift for making difficult things seem easy and fun.  His channel has a new structured beginner course playlist (which follows a different syllabus from the books), along with literally hundreds of scripted lessons on specific grammar topics and frequently asked questions, and recordings of his livestream classes.  Whatever textbooks you decide to use, check out his channel.\n\nThe *Korean Made Simple* books are similar to his videos in the sense that they focus on serious grammar fundamentals in a fun and breezy way that never feels like a slog.  Each lesson starts with a dialogue in Korean, followed by a step-by-step explanation of everything from the dialogue with more examples at each point.  Reading it is like having a conversation with a good teacher.  But like his videos, the books are not \"dense\".  There is plenty of material to learn, but each lesson doesn't have too much Korean to read or very many practice exercises, so you really have to come up with ways to practice on your own.\n\n*Korean from Zero* is a more professionally-produced, more conventional product.  It's well-designed for self study and more like a workbook, with activities to complete throughout each lesson.  Sometimes it uses tables and diagrams like a school textbook does instead of just lucidly explaining things and giving examples.  I thought it was okay, but I didn't really connect with it.  I didn't love that they make up some of their own terminology, like calling the conjugated verb stem that many other grammar forms are built with (known variously as the \uc544/\uc5b4 form, casual form, infinitive, or \ud574\uccb4 form) the \"BASIC form\".

I probably *should* be reading something harder, but I\u2019m lazy.\n\nIf you\u2019re just starting out, you should follow a structured curriculum of some kind.

The computer voices have improved, but they still sound robotic and weird and you should learn to pronounce Korean by listening to humans.

And many of the sentences are designed to demonstrate a particular grammatical principle so they awkward and weird.

One major limitation is that it uses text-to-speech computer voices, which sound a bit weird and robotic, instead of recordings of real people speaking Korean.  Another is what you're encountering: Korean is different enough from European languages that it's difficult to guess the rules just from practice.  It's much easier when you get some explanation first.  Fortunately, as another user mentioned, the web version of Duolingo does provide some basic notes with each lesson, and there are a ton of other resources recommended in the stickied beginner thread of this subreddit that can take you much further.  \n\nI'm not selling anything, and you're welcome to use whatever resources you find helpful, but \"Learn Korean with GO! Billy Korean\" and \"Prof. Yoon's Korean Language Class\" are YouTube channels by two wonderful (and very different from each other) teachers who both have excellent structured beginner playlists.\n\nAs for those suffixes: Korean likes to keep things neat and orderly by attaching words called \"particles\" to each noun to tell you what role it has in a sentence.  It's a little like the case endings in Latin, but much easier.  Some very important ones you have met so far are...\n\n\uc774/\uac00 (\uc774 after a word ending in a consonant, \uac00 after a word ending in a vowel) - Marks the *grammatical subject* of the verb, that is to say the thing that is doing something or being something.\n\n \uc744/\ub97c (\uc744 after a consonant, \ub97c after a vowel) - Marks the *direct object* of an action verb, that is to say the thing that is getting something done to it.\n\n\uc740/\ub294 (consonant/vowel) - Marks the *topic* of the conversation.  The topic is what you are interested in talking about.  Sometimes translated as \"As for...\" or \"when it comes to...\".  And once something is the topic, you can converse about it without restating it, at least until somebody changes the topic.  In simple sentences, it can also be the subject of the verb, but it doesn't have to be. More complex sentences can have a topic and one or more verbs each with their own subject.\n\n\ub4e4 - Makes a noun plural.  Very optional.  Used for emphasis or if its necessary to specify.\n\n\uc758 - Makes a noun posses the noun after it, similar to \"'s\" in English.\n \n\uc5d0\uac8c - Marks a person as the *indirect object* of a verb, the one who receives the effect or benefit of the action.\n\n\uc5d0 - Marks the location where something is *exists* or the *destination* of a movement.\n\n\uc5d0\uc11c - Marks where an action *happens* or the *origin* of a movement\n\n\uacfc/\uc640 - Means \"and\" or \"with\" when connecting nouns together.  \ud558\uace0 and \uc774\ub791/\ub791 are more casual words that do the same thing.\n\nI hope that's what you're looking for.  Any textbook or online course will introduce these and others one by one, with plenty of examples.\n\nEdit: FYI the \u3134 in \ub0a8\uc790 is an N sound.

Like many communist countries, North Korea used language reform as one component of their political revolution.  You can't build a communist autocracy in an undeveloped, exploited colony without coming up with words for \"proletariat\", \"bourgeoise\", \"dialectic\", \"vanguard party\", \"tractor\", \"rural electrification\", \"nomenclatura\", and all the rest.  North Korea also formally abolished the use of Chinese characters long before they faded from use (but are still optional) in the South.  They undertook (then retracted) a major spelling reform.  They created many new native-Korean neologisms to replace certain Sino-Korean words that were first coined in Japan or associated with Japanese colonialism.  They created other neologisms or imported words from Russian to describe new things that South Korea uses English loanwords for.  It's really quite interesting.\n\nI suspect North Korean speech also had an significant indirect effect on South Korean language too.

My apologies if I contributed to any misunderstanding.\n\nWiktionary says the standard for \u3153 is [\u028c\u0339], so an open-mid back vowel somewhere between [\u028c] and [\u0254] in terms of roundedness.  Wiktionary says \"saw\", as in the cutting tool or the past tense of \"see\" is pronounced /s\u0254\u02d0/ in Received Pronunciation, /s\u0254/ in General American, and /s\u0251\u02d0/ with the cot-caught merger (which is most Americans).\n\nWhen I hear Koreans pronounce \u3153, depending on the word and the speaker, I hear something in a range covered by [\u0259], [\u028c], [\u0254] [\u0251] or [\u0252].  To my ear, it sorts into two main variations, with the more closed and definitely-unrounded [\u0259] or [\u028c] being less common, and a more back, rounded and possibly more-open [\u0254] or [\u0252] being more common.  I am from the NYC metro area, so while my accent isn't particularly \"broawwwd\", I fully distinguish \"caught\" and \"cot\" and pronounce words like \"saw\" more closed, back, and rounded than many Americans, close to what I hear as the second variation of \u3153 (and quite unlike the first).  On the other hand, an Alabamian would probably pronounce it as /s\u0250\u02d0/ which is more open, more fronted, and completely unrounded.  A Korean would probably transcribe his pronunciation as \uc0ac, and mine as \uc11c.\n\nI think this goes to show your dialect of English can affect both your perception of Korean phonology and of the English sounds you compare it to.  I think I'm pretty sensitive to distinctions between different vowels in the lower-right \"Fran Drescher\" region of the chart, but I can't necessarily write something and expect people read the same thing I hear in my head without switching to a system like IPA.  And for those of us (like me!) who are not trained linguists, using IPA also depends on comparing the recordings on see-n-say charts which are themselves not always consistent.  \n\nI don't know what to do about this.  Ad-hoc phonetic spelling is a disaster because we don't all speak or hear English the same.  Revised Romanization is a consistent way to transcribe Korean phonemes, but can't teach anyone how to pronounce them.  Asking people to study IPA in order to talk about Korean instead of just studying Korean is silly and counterproductive.  And making a \"no pronunciation questions\" rule or answering everything with a link to a Korean-only pronunciation video or \uac00\ub098\ub2e4 song doesn't seem great either.\n\nAnyway, I'm sorry if I contributed to any further confusion or misinformation.  \n\nIPA's official chart with multiple recordings: https://www.internationalphoneticassociation.org/IPAcharts/inter_chart_2018/IPA_2018.html", "created_utc": "1621922655.0", "edited": "False", "id": "gzd2gdd", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_nkde9m", "parent_id": "t1_gzcobkd", "score": "7", "subreddit": "Korean", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rd8q"}, {"author": "Daehan-Dankook", "body": "And here\u2019s GO!

It sounds like the trouble you've identified has as much to do with learning Korean phonology (the sounds represented by the Korean letters and how they fit together) as it does with actual hangul reading fluency.  That's fine, and you're right to recognize that Duolingo is no good for learning the sound of Korean because the text-to-speech voices just are not very good.  Whether you have a live teacher, recordings that go with your course materials, or watch a lot of videos, you need to learn pronunciation by listening to and imitating real people speaking Korean.  \n\nI would suggest looking up the YouTube channels \"Learn Korean with GO! Billy Korean\" (very good nonnative teacher, goofy influencer style disguises an old-school emphasis on grammar fundamentals, is an excellent explainer) and \"Prof. Yoon's Korean Language Class\" (native Korean professor at the University of Iowa, teaches the entire Integrated Korean and Sejong Institute textbook series on YouTube, but you don't really need the books to follow along).  Look for Billy's beginner course playlist and Professor Yoon's playlist for Integrated Korean Beginner 1.  Both start off by teaching the sounds and letters of Hangul, and continue on to basic grammar and vocabulary.  Also look up \"Korean babo with Jemma\".  She has not been active for a while, but her channel has lessons (including on the basics of hangul) taught entirely in the most clearly-enunciated Korean I have ever heard (with English subs, of course).\n\nIf you understand Korean phonology, romanization will not really lead you astray, though you will probably still find it annoying and useless.  There are only a handful of romanization schemes in common use and they are consistent systems for representing Korean pronunciation, so you just come to know \"eo\" represents the same sound as \"\uc5b4\" which sounds a bit like the sound of a Real Noo Yawka saying \"oh my GAWD\" and nothing like \"ee-oh\" or whatever.\n\nAs for reading, the way to get better at it is to read more, and the place to read more as a beginner who does not know many words or grammar forms yet is in Chapter 1 of your textbook or TTMIK course or Duolingo or whatever you want to work on.  Just like English, you will learn to recognize the words that you know without sounding out each letter, so if you're seeing whole syllables or words instead of letters then that's a sign of progress!\n\nLastly, a lot of people do not have anything good to say about Duolingo, but I personally found it pretty useful within its limitations.  The computer voices are not good, and the course is a bit of an outlier in that it teaches the formal-polite \u3142\ub2c8\ub2e4 speech style before the informal-polite \uc544\uc694/\uc5b4\uc694 style that is more common in everyday conversation, but you'll never see romanization again after the third alphabet lesson.  To get the most out of Duolingo, use the desktop webpage.  The web version has an option to turn the word bank off and has access to \"tips\" pages before each lesson that actually explain the grammar and any confusing vocabulary words you will encounter!  It's not a full replacement for a textbook by any means, but it should give you enough information to understand what you are supposed to learn from the sentences in the lesson, and will help you look up the concepts in greater detail in other resources.

We don't have separate words for these in English, but if you know Spanish it's similar to the verb \"haber\".

These are usually nouns, verbs made from a noun plus \ud558\ub2e4 or suru, or for Japanese, na-adjectives (which are a kind of noun).  They are often \"fancier\" words or vocabulary for more advanced or modern concepts, and they often sound similar because they are based on Japan and Korea's respective interpretation of the ancient Chinese sound of the same characters.  \n\nSometimes, these are old classical words from China, but many cases asian words for modern ideas were first coined in Japan during the Meiji period.

Just think how many English-learners never lose interest in learning English after achieving baseline proficiency because it wasn't *English* they cared about in the first place.  Knowing English well was a just means of getting jobs, traveling, making friends, and participating in the wider world.  On the other hand, if you're learning just for fun then there is absolutely nothing wrong with moving on when your curiosity is satisfied.\n\nFor me, I'm learning Korean as my spouse's heritage language.

Know the sound each letter has when it's the beginning or end of a syllable.    One trick is that the names of the letters tell you their sounds.  \u3148 is  \"Ji-euT\", \u3139 is \"Ri-euL\", \u3147 is \"_i-euNG\", and so on.  \n\n2. Understand that when the next syllable of the same word starts with \u3147, the batchim (final consonant) of the last syllable \"continues through\" and is pronounced with its initial sound as if it was the beginning of the next syllable.  For example \uaf43 \"flower\" is pronounced \"kkot\", but if I add the subject particle to say \uaf43\uc774 \uc608\uc069\ub2c8\ub2e4 \"The flowers are pretty\", \uaf43\uc774 is pronounced \"kko-chi\".\n\n3.  Know that the \u3142 in the formal polite endings (-\u3142\ub2c8\ub2e4/-\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4/-\uc785\ub2c8\uae4c etc...) is always pronounced /m/.  It's gamsaHAMnida, never gamsaHAPnieda.  This is part of a general rule about consonants when they come before nasal sounds, but this one instance of the formal-polite endings is very common and it just wouldn't sound right to greet somebody with \"AnnyeonghaSHIBnikka\".\n\nThere are a lot of other \"batchim rules\" that explain how sounds interact when they are next to each other, and in my opinion they are important but it isn't so necessary to stress over them.  They mostly describe things that happen automatically when you say different sounds together.  GO! Billy and Prof. Yoon's beginner playlists on YouTube both provide pretty good explanations if I recall, and if you just search \"batchim rules\" you'll find many more teachers who discuss them.  Once you understand the basics, I think you will be okay if you start getting into grammar and words and just pay attention to the pronunciation of the new words you are learning.\n\nGood luck and have fun!\n\nEdit: If you haven't discovered them yet, here are links to playlists for Billy's beginner grammar course and Professor Yoon's instruction for the Integrated Korean Beginner 1 textbook (you do not need the book to follow the videos).

I don't think Korean would be harder coming from Chinese.\n\nOn the one hand, Chinese *is* even more analytic than English.  That is, Chinese words usually don't change their form at all and relationships between them are conveyed with word order and helper-words instead.  As you'll have discovered, Korean is the opposite way.  You can modify words with endless combinations of endings and particles to create monstrous frankenwords that aren't in the dictionary, but the word order is relatively free.  I can think of a few other things about Korean that Chinese students might have a harder time with.  Hangul sound change rules and spelling are easy-peasy for English speakers, but in Chinese each syllable is pronounced distinctely and only the tone is really affected by nearby syllables.  Mandarin has lost all its syllable-end consonants except /n/ and /ng/, while Korean has a few more that don't give English speakers any trouble.  Maaaybe English speakers are more used to SOV sentences because we use them sometimes for dramatic effect (as in, \"With this ring, I thee wed\") under the influence of Latin and older forms of English, but that's a stretch.\n\nOn the other hand, a Chinese speaker would find *vast* amounts of Sino-Korean vocabulary at least familiar if not exactly comprehensible.  She would be familiar with topic-comment sentences, counting nouns using measure-words, not having definite or indefinite articles, not usually marking plurals, using particles to modify words, and all kinds of other grammatical and cultural things that are shared despite Korean and Chinese having different structures.\n\nIn the end, I think the vocabulary makes the biggest difference.  Korean pronunciation and grammar are hard no matter what, but once you learn them, you have learned them.

First, the way to get better at reading Korean is to read more Korean.  Start with the contents of your textbook or other learning resources (any good one should be filled with comprehensible sentences to read and will avoid using romanization) and then read anything else you can get your hands on.  If you aren't following some kind of structured program to learn basic grammar and your first few hundred words, I highly recommend doing so.  That can be a good textbook, a web course like talktomeinkorean.com, or video series.  I second the user who recommended the YouTube channels of \"Learn Korean with GO! Billy Korean\" (start with his beginner course playlist) and \"Prof. Yoon's Korean Language Class\" (start with his playlist teaching the Integrated Korean Beginning 1 textbook, you don't need the book to follow the videos).  For dictionaries, Naver's EN-KO dictionary (en.dict.naver.com) is very comprehensive and has examples for almost everything.  The English version of Wiktionary (www.wiktionary.org) is also very useful, but not as comprehensive. Use the English site but type your search in hangul, and you get definitions in English, verb/adjective conjugation charts, and often examples and links to related words.\n\nGood luck and have fun! \ud654\uc774\ud305!", "created_utc": "1611975484.0", "edited": "False", "id": "glbriy2", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_l83nup", "parent_id": "t3_l83nup", "score": "2", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "Daehan-Dankook", "body": "Interesting, thank you.", "created_utc": "1611846888.0", "edited": "False", "id": "gl3lw93", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_l6gwdl", "parent_id": "t1_gl2imjq", "score": "2", "subreddit": "linguisticshumor", "subreddit_id": "t5_2vwiq"}, {"author": "Daehan-Dankook", "body": "I mean, deriving your male personal pronoun from a demonstrative for a nearby thing and your female personal pronoun for a demonstrative for a distant thing is still a bit shabby.\n\nI'll file that in the same uncharitable-but-not-really-harmful-nowadays drawer as the fact that many endonyms mean \"the kinfolk\" or \"the people who can speak\" and many exonyms mean \"the barbarians\" or \"the blokes what talk funny\".", "created_utc": "1611809338.0", "edited": "False", "id": "gl1tw41", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_l6gwdl", "parent_id": "t3_l6gwdl", "score": "21", "subreddit": "linguisticshumor", "subreddit_id": "t5_2vwiq"}, {"author": "Daehan-Dankook", "body": "The subject (\uc774/\uac00) and direct object (\uc744/\ub97c) are exactly the same as in English.

Shocking plot twist!\n\nThe topic (\uc740/\ub294) is a separate concept which is much more important in Korean than it is in English.  It's *what you are interested in talking about*.  Korean loves to use something called topic-comment sentence structure, which is where you establish a topic and then make some kind of complete statement about it which may have it's own subject.  In simple sentences, the same thing can be both the topic of the conversation and the grammatical subject of the sentence.  In that case, which one you pick changes the nuance of the sentence, but getting that exactly right is a little more of an advance topic.  What I think is important to understand right away is how the topic and subject can work together to unlock more complex expressions.\n\nSometimes a topic-comment structure is just how Koreans like to express things.  \uc624\ub298\uc740 \ub0a0\uc528\uac00 \uc544\uc8fc \ub098\ube60\uc694. \ube44\uac00 \ub9ce\uc774 \uc640\uc694.

We are talking about what \"today\" is like, but it is the weather that is being \"bad\" and the rain that is \"coming\".  There are other ways to say that, but \n\nOther times, it's necessary to use them together to use a certain grammar form.  The usual way to express possession is a good example of that.  \uc81c \ub204\ub098\ub294 \ub3c8\uc774 \ud56d\uc0c1 \ub9ce\uc774 \uc788\uc5b4\uc694.  My sister-(topic) money-(subject) always a lot exists.

The money is the thing doing the existing, so it is the subject.  My sister is the one who owns it and the one we are talking about, so she is the topic.\n\nHope that helps!", "created_utc": "1611807916.0", "edited": "False", "id": "gl1r9w2", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_l6mt2l", "parent_id": "t3_l6mt2l", "score": "6", "subreddit": "Korean", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rd8q"}, {"author": "Daehan-Dankook", "body": "\ub97c is always the thing being verbed.

You can say \u201cgoodbye\u201d with \uc548\ub155\ud788 \uac00\uc138\uc694. \uc548\ub155 is the same, and \ud788 is \ud558\ub2e4 turned into an adverb, so \uc548\ub155\ud788 is \u201cpeacefully\u201d. Then \uac00\ub2e4 is the verb \u201cto go\u201d, with the same -\uc138\uc694 ending. So the whole sentence means \u201cPlease go in peace\u201d.\n\nI don\u2019t recommend getting too wrapped up in different verb forms at the very beginning. You\u2019ll either learn the -\u3142\ub2c8\ub2e4 formal-polite present tense form, or the -\uc5b4\uc694/\uc544\uc694 informal-polite one and that will be enough to learn some vocabulary and start making sentences. But make sure you really understand the difference between nouns, verbs, and adverbs (Korean adjectives are a kind of verb, \uc608\uc058\ub2e4 means \u201cto *be* pretty\u201d) and make sure you understand the difference between the subject and object of a sentence.

Grammar is a hack or cheat code that helps busy adults learn way faster than babies, who spend five entire years being talked to almost non-stop in their target language and they still sound like complete idiots until they go to school for many years where they have to be taught grammar anyway.\n\nThat said, I think grammar instruction should be a fairly small fraction of your overall contact hours with a language.  The people who get really good at a foreign language get good by interacting with it (and interacting with people in it) nonstop.  I think it's much more than 750 hours, but even that is two years with a full hour of instruction or contact every single day.  To use Spanish as an example, you might watch hundreds of hours of telenovelas and never figure out why \"you have\" is sometimes \"t\u00fa tienes\" and sometimes \"t\u00fa tengas\" on your own.  But if somebody were to explain the concept of the subjunctive to you *just one time*, a lesson that might only take one hour, then every time you see \"tengas\" you would understand that it's part of a clause that talking about a wish, doubt, or emotion.  From just a tiny bit of grammar study, hundreds of hours of telenovela became more comprehensible, freeing your brain up to look at higher-level patterns (\"She used subjunctive 'tengas' in '\u00a1Ojal\u00e1 que tengas miedo!' because it's a verb that follows a WEIRDO expression and 'que', she would do the same thing if she said '\u00a1Quero que tengas miedo!\" instead of \"Okay, 'tengas' goes with 'ojal\u00e1 que', I guess\").\n\n&nbsp;\n\nEdit for clarification: I used the phrase \"be taught grammar\" casually and imprecisely.  To the best of my knowledge, academic linguists consider grammar to *describe* the structure of speech that native speakers produce intuitively.  No native speaker, even a small child, can be grammatically incorrect.  They are only using a variety of the language that is different from the standard or formal variety and may have a different structure.  When teachers use a combination of feedback, formal grammar instruction, composition exercises, and guided reading of progressively longer and more sophisticated texts, what they are doing is helping students to think explicitly about the language's structure and to manipulate it intentionally, often with the intention of producing persuasive output in the standard or prestige variety of their language.  This is relevant because I think most adult language learners would like to learn the form of the standard language used by educated native adults in informal and formal situations, not the playground speech of small children.  In my experience as an adult learner, studying the structure of standard educated speech directly is especially useful when you do not have many years to attend primary and secondary school in your target language.\n\n*If I am mistaken, I welcome any linguists or educators to make substantive corrections.*", "created_utc": "1606006794.0", "edited": "1606029973.0", "id": "gd4zqgb", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_jyjy19", "parent_id": "t3_jyjy19", "score": "22", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "Daehan-Dankook", "body": "I think it varies a lot by language, since most of the courses besides the core European languages are developed by volunteers.

You are 100% correct that anyone writing or speaking in Latin today (which some people are clearly doing above the A1 level) is working in a best-guess approximation of the literary register of a living language that hasn't existed for a long time.  The same could be said of Isaac Newton when he wrote the Principia.  And anyone, Newton included, who says he or she can speak real gutter-Roman from the mean streets of Subura is obviously full of shit.\n\nBut I respectfully disagree on the value judgement. The Romans are all dead. Their language and literature are useless to them in the grave.  Their books, while wonderful in their own right and foundational to European culture, are just fucking books.  They don't have feelings, and a postmodernist would argue they don't even *mean anything* on their own until you read them and interpret them in light of everything else you've ever read.  \n\nI am a postmodernist when it comes to Latin itself.  Its only \"point\" is whatever value it has to the living and future people who use it.  That value may be in \"translating and decoding\" the classical literature to you, in reading and appreciating it with minimal translation to someone else, in trying one's hand at writing a verse in a classical style to a third person, or chatting with friends in a \"secret code\" with ancient roots, or rage-tweeting Latin insults at Donald Trump (I aint tell you how to live your life, don't tell me how to live mine).  I do think we have *some* obligation to be good stewards of the language.  I cannot declare that \"canis\" means \"cat\" now, and we should be honest about how much we do and don't know about the classical epoch, but Latin belongs to *us* now, until we pass it on to the future and go to join the Romans.

Some other similarities I notice are using measure words to count nouns, no articles at all, optional marking of plurals, and a frequently using a topic-comment sentence structure.\n\nOn the other hand, Korean pronunciation and grammar are very different.  Korean has no tones, but retains many final consonants and even allows consonant clusters in limited circumstances.  Consonants have different initial and final pronunciations, and even affect each other's pronunciation in adjacent syllables similar to tone sandhi in Chinese.  Word order is freer than in Chinese as long as the main verb or adjective comes last because the nouns and subordinate clauses are all marked with particles that show their functions.  You can omit almost anything except the main verb and still have a grammatical sentence that is (supposedly) understandable in context.  Native Korean words can sometimes be broken down into individual morphemes, but it's not strictly one-morpheme-per-syllable like Chinese (and Sino-Korean words).  Verbs don't care about person or number, but inflect to show tense/aspect, subject honorificness, and formality/politeness (the four common speech levels are formal-polite for fancy speech, casual-polite for everyday polite conversation, casual-nonpolite for intimate speech, and formal-nonpolite for impersonal writing and sounding imperious in speech).\n\nIf you think you'll like Korean, by all means don't be discouraged and dive into it, but it's definitely its own thing.  Once you know some words and can conjugate the casual-polite present tense, you can start speaking right away, but learning to speak or understand more sophisticated sentences involves learning more grammar rules and forms in addition to more words.", "created_utc": "1603740507.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ga74661", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_jihirk", "parent_id": "t3_jihirk", "score": "6", "subreddit": "Korean", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rd8q"}, {"author": "Daehan-Dankook", "body": "It's true that not even the most elaborate fever dreams of the macro-Altaicists posit a *genetic* relationship between the Sino-Tibetan family and Korean, and as a learner of Korean who dabbled ages ago in Mandarin I don't think they sound remotely the same in terms of their prosody.  But you can't ignore the fact that about two-thirds of Korean's vocabulary are Sino-Korean words that were either imported from Middle Chinese in dynastic times or newly coined (usually in Japan) from Chinese characters and imported back into Chinese and Korean in the 19th or 20th centuries.

But there are not usually multiple \"on'yomi\" readings as there are in Japanese and hanja do not have native \"kun'yomi\" readings.  \u5929 means \"heaven\" and is pronounced with its sino reading \ucc9c/cheon, never the native equivalent \ud558\ub298/ha-neul which would always be written with hangul.", "created_utc": "1602378009.0", "edited": "False", "id": "g8el9s6", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_j8ntk0", "parent_id": "t3_j8ntk0", "score": "13", "subreddit": "linguistics", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhos"}, {"author": "Daehan-Dankook", "body": "It\u2019s fine, but it\u2019s just an introduction to Latin.

Every single textbook, class, and online course begins with some form of \uc874\ub313\ub9d0, and unless you only want to talk to your spouse or childhood best friends, you should too.\n\nThe most important part of polite speech, beside maybe never saying the word \"you\" to someone you're not close with, is choosing the right verb ending style or \"speech level\".  The two that are common in spoken \uc874\ub313\ub9d0 are formal-polite \"\u3142\ub2c8\ub2e4-style\" and casual-polite \"\uc694-style\".  Formal-polite is used in formal or institutional situations, for public speaking, and to show extra respect to somebody much higher than you.  Casual-polite is used for most everyday conversation with everyone from strangers to acquaintances to even good friends who are a bit older than you.  Depending on the other words you use, such as your choice of humble/honorific pronouns and titles, the honorific \uc2dc particle, and whether or not you leave out particles and use a lot of contractions it can go from almost as polite as \u3142\ub2c8\ub2e4 style to quite casual but still polite.\n\nThe \u3142\ub2c8\ub2e4 style is slightly easier to learn in the present tense because there are fewer irregulars, but most learning materials start with the \uc694 style because it's what you should speak most of the time.  The good news is that once you know it, you also know how to use the most common \ubc18\ub9d0 style, because it's exactly the same but without the \uc694 at the end.\n\nEdit: Dammit, *without* the \uc694 at the end.", "created_utc": "1602281613.0", "edited": "1602282194.0", "id": "g89cufp", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_j87dku", "parent_id": "t3_j87dku", "score": "7", "subreddit": "Korean", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rd8q"}, {"author": "Daehan-Dankook", "body": "For me, I think there will eventually be a milestone where using a Korean name in Korean will feel natural and not like a weeb affectation, but that\u2019s a long way off.
