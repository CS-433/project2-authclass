I have to burp it all out at least three times a night. On days I can't get the gas out, I try squatting as much as possible and kind of pushing my butt outward or making not-so-sexy thrusting motions to move the gas in the right direction. It helps but I've got to do it every time I feel gas bubbling down there.   \nAlso, I have the luxury of a squat toilet and I like to think that pooping that way helps everything come out unlike with western toilets where I feel like not all of the feces have come out when I feel I should be done. Try to squat poop if you can. \n\nMy main triggers are high-fodmap foods, dairy, eggs, gluten, and fake sugar (depending on the type).

My research involves the physio-psychological aspects of the brain-gut axis. Specifically, I would like to know what attention-based symptoms correlate to gastrointestinal symptoms (if any) in adults. For more details, please comment, DM me, or (for a more brief overview) refer to the below abstract I had made for my thesis proposal which has been accepted by my institution's IRB (I can provide the IRB letter if necessary). Lastly, I will be posting the results of my study once it has been completed in the next month or two.  \nSurvey: [https://qfreeaccountssjc1.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV\\_9zDDswBNJfOjy0S](https://qfreeaccountssjc1.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_9zDDswBNJfOjy0S)  (which includes the informed consent)  \n**Abstract**:  \nThe field of psychogastroenterology, or the study of the relationship between the brain and the gastrointestinal tract, has increasingly gained practical implications for the field of medicine. However, little research has focused on the link between irritable bowel syndrome and attention deficits. The current research aims first to add to the literature by looking for possible correlations between the severity of symptoms from attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) presentations / concentration deficit disorder (CDD; AKA sluggish cognitive tempo) symptoms and the severity of symptoms from irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) symptom presentations. The second aim of the proposed research is to identify if there is still a significant correlation between attention deficit severity and IBS severity after controlling for anxiety, depression, and medication use. The study will recruit participants (aged 18 years or older) online from relevant subReddits (e.g., those focused on ADHD, IBS, and CDD). Consenting participants will be asked to complete six online questionnaires to measure demographic information, ADHD and CDD symptoms, IBS symptoms, anxiety, depression, and medication status. The study should take no more than 20 minutes to complete and will be completely online for anonymous, voluntary participation from anyone who is 18 years old or older. Quantitative data will be obtained solely from the survey questions which will not at any point ask for nor collect identifying information such as names, date of birth, user IDs, or computer IDs.
