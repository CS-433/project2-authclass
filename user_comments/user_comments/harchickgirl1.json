The train to the city is a 2-minute walk, and in 10 minutes we're in the city.\n\nWe got rid of so many things. We condensed 3 living rooms into one, we got rid of all our dining room furniture, we bought a smaller, extendable kitchen table, we gave away other superfluous furniture, we donated a lot of old clothes to the high school theatre department, and we op-shopped a lot of kids' games and kitchen stuff. I got to reassess our art prints, ornaments and family photos and keep only the most beloved things. We went from 4 cars to one.\n\nWe put the remainder in a storage unit, promising ourselves we'd give it up in one year. We're not going to make it because of pandemic lockdowns, but we'll clean it out within 15 months. My plan is to go from 7 Christmas storage boxes to 4 this year.\n\nWeirdly, both kids live within 15 minutes of us. That wasn't planned, but it makes me so happy.\n\nI can take more walks, I can shop at a high-quality market, I can go to the pub, I can join language clubs, I can get to the city and beach easily, I can live in a cool old building down a cobblestoned laneway.\n\nI love my more active, uncluttered life.", "created_utc": "1649285288.0", "edited": "1649285777.0", "id": "i3ov61f", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_txqiuu", "parent_id": "t3_txqiuu", "score": "6", "subreddit": "AskOldPeople", "subreddit_id": "t5_2yg69"}, {"author": "harchickgirl1", "body": "Hi YanXP.\n\nYour textbook is wrong.

It was tethered to the wall in a common area of the house. (Rich people had a second phone in the master bedroom.) You had to sit in the uncomfortable chair next to it, or lie on the floor. Your mother always yelled at you to get up as she stepped over you.\n\nIf you wanted to talk to your friends, it was a public conversation. Your mother was always in earshot in the kitchen, and she was always listening.\n\nThe conversion was always transactional because if you stayed on for more than five minutes, your mother told you to \"get off the phone to free up the line!\" You could never just chat.\n\nIf you were on the phone and your father needed it, you got off - no ifs, ands or buts.\n\nIf you wanted to call your boyfriend, you always had to go through his father first. \"Hi, is Wayne there?\" Even if the father was your biology teacher. So embarrassing. Your business was always everyone else's business.\n\nWhoever answered the phone had to relay bad news if the other person on the line wasn't discreet. I once answered the phone to find out that my grandfather had died of a heart attack. I had to tell my father that his father was dead. Hardest thing I ever had to do.\n\nIf your family suffered a tragedy, you had to answer the phone a hundred times. Each call demanded your immediate attention with a loud mechanical ring. There was no texting the news or texting your condolences. There was no \"I'll deal with that text later,\" or \"I'll just send it to the group chat.\" So you had to explain the tragedy time after time after time. And you had to do it when the caller demanded, not when you were up to it.\n\nIt was expensive. I always dreaded when my mother received the phone bill. Doubly so when I moved overseas and had to pay for it myself. One time my teenaged sister came to visit me and ran up a $125 monthly phone bill. Nothing you could do but pay it. The talking to I gave her ruined our relationship until she went out on her own, started paying her own bills and realised what she'd done.\n\nIf you were away from home and needed to make a call, you had to find a pay phone, find 25\u00a2, and pray it wasn't broken. You also had to pray that the person you were calling was home to receive the call. Otherwise, you couldn't reach them. Imagine you were waiting for them and they hadn't shown up. No idea what to do, so you just went home.\n\nI love my mobile phone. It's portable. It lets me text my intended recipient without any gatekeeping. It tells me the time, date and weather. I can carry photos of my family and my father's obituary. It lets me watch my favourite TV show on demand. I can read my favourite newspapers. I can book a flight, car or accommodation in five minutes. I can sell my car or even my house. I can do my job online in a worldwide pandemic. I can play backgammon. It contains the equivalent of the Encyclopedia Britannica. It doesn't cost $1/minute to call internationally. And it fits in the palm of my hand.

It's rare that you have to come up with a lesson on your own.

A page of tessalations could be used for Year 8 art or Year 9 geometry. Some tricky grammar (who/whom or which/that) could be used for any level. A short poem could be analysed in Year 10 or 11 English. A short biography about Nikola Tesla or Madam CJ Walker would work for Year  8 science or Year 10 business. I developed a Family Feud game show with different fun questions in a variety of subjects. You get the idea. You can adapt any of these for primary. \n\nOne of the most successful lessons I was ever given was on our solar system for an upper primary ESL science/maths class. You would need a long piece of string (a little more than 3 metres), a ruler/tape measure, nine clothes pegs and separate laminated pictures of the sun and each of the planets, labelled. Hang up the string, peg the sun to the left, and ask the kids to peg the planets in order according to their distance from the sun. First they need to guess. It'll be hilarious how wrong they are. Then have them google it and adjust the pictures to the correct order/distance. See the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory - California Institute of Technology - Planet Distance Chart for the distance representations (e.g. Mercury is 4cm from the sun, Neptune is 300cm). Then they can fill in a cloze exercise about what they learned/real distances and draw a picture of our solar system. There's an hour right there. It's a great visual lesson that they'll never forget. It takes you a half hour to research and make, and you can keep these things in the boot of your car or a plastic pocket in your bag.\n\nYou probably don't need to go in the first day with something like this prepared. But you should develop it over your first year, and collect every provided resource that works.\n\nWhen the coordinator asks you to be a CRT, ask them if the work is already prepared. If it's not, ask them for support. Most of the time, they'll help you (hook you up with another subject teacher). Rarely, they'll say you're on your own. That's when you pull out your bag of tricks. \n\nThey don't expect you to teach a top quality lesson. They just want you to keep the kids engaged and safe.

I started to lose, and I felt like I could tackle it. \n\nBut after 5 months, my husband's grandmother died, I had another interstate move (husband in army), and I hated my new house, so I went off the program. I went to another family doctor and got the name of another nutritionist. Well, she started shaming me. She was terrible. So I quit.\n\nI came down with clinical depression for four years (probably due to the lack of help and all the other stressers!) and the weight has steadily crept up over the years.\n\nNow I'm on Noom because the pandemic has had me sitting around for 11 months, I have high blood pressure, my fitness has plummeted and my lifestyle has been severely impacted.\n\nSo well done, you, for only gaining 7 pounds so far. Do yourself a favor and keep with the program! You'll emerge from this pregnancy in a lot better shape than I did, and you'll manage your health, lifestyle and the stresses of a newborn and toddler much better than I did going forward. \n\nYour 58 year old self will thank you.

We are so compatible in so many ways, and I don't see his looks, I see him.  \n\nAlso, if you are too shy to FaceTime with him, then you are definitely not ready for the more intimate aspects of marriage.

He wasn't being mean, just clueless and unused to a new situation (my independence and status as an adult).\n\nI asked him to uninvite her.  He was really reluctant to do so because he didn't want to make her feel bad.  But I politely insisted because otherwise I'd have to significantly alter the already-planned vacation to accommodate her needs.\n\nHe uninvited her.

Your mom needs to fix this. \"Mom, I'm sorry, but I am not going to give Auntie my hair.  You should not have volunteered it without asking me first.  How can you help fix this?\" \n\nIn the process, she will start to realize that you are an independent person now with thoughts and feelings of your own.  You are your own agent, and you can volunteer your own hair as you see fit.  Or not.  \n\nIt may be awkward in the family for a while, but that's on them, not on you.  Don't allow yourself to accept their disapproval.  Don't take it on board.  Rebuff it.  \"Sorry.  I was never consulted about this, and I never agreed.  I'm not going to discuss it again.\"\n\nLet this be the start of your independence and standing up for yourself. Don't ever let your mom take away your agency again.  \"Mom, we spoke about this.\"  It'll be very hard at first, but worth it.\n\nGood luck.", "created_utc": "1556858563.0", "edited": "1556859096.0", "id": "emdtfog", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_bjw8cd", "parent_id": "t3_bjw8cd", "score": "7", "subreddit": "AmItheAsshole", "subreddit_id": "t5_2xhvq"}, {"author": "harchickgirl1", "body": "The fact that you care and that you are doing critical thinking around it means that you will be a good mother.\n\nRemember, you don't have to be perfect.
