Who's your bias??' but if I tell someone I'm learning Italian it's usually 'Oh well that's a beautiful language. It's so sophisticated. Did you want to learn it because you're studying music? Maybe you can go one day, it's such a beautiful country with such rich culture and history.' \nWhy can't it be, 'Well that's cool! I've heard Korean is a hard language, what got you into it?' Why can't people take it like any other language? \nMakes me want to make 'fun' of other people when I hear them say they want to learn any 'normal' language. 'Oh is that because that's just the easiest language? Did you pick that because it's what everyone else was learning? You must really like this sports team, everyone from that country is obsessed with them. Well then which album from this band was your favorite? You're learning that language so obviously you listen to this band. \n\nReally people? Why?

A chance to share my wonderful obscure music tastes with fellow music theory nerds :)\n\n*The Act of Forgiveness* by Scarypoolparty -- I'm not sure how many genres this album goes through but I love it so much. Even though each song differs and moves to a new sound, when you play it from beginning to end it's coherent, so by the end you're not sure how you got where you are. So fun. \n\n*Inca Missiles* by Tibetan Miracle Seeds -- abstract? hypnotic? out of tune? Yes, and no. It's SO vibes with notes of Indian sitar (please don't come at me if I'm wrong about that) and definitely *one with nature*-ish, but it's so enjoyable. I've only known one person to know about them, but they're so good. \n\n*S&M by Metallica* (also S&M2 if you like the first) -- like metal? Like classical? Metallica literally did a concert with the San Fransisco Symphony Orchestra, and it's like nothing I've ever heard before. The sound produced is so huge, and so energetic, it's captivating. Even in the slower more orchestral songs, the emotion and energy is off the charts. Definitely worth a shot. \n\nAny music by *wave to earth* (they have not produced very much and it's mostly singles that have yet to be put into a full album) -- a small and underrated band, they don't have much music to their name but what they do have is fantasmagorical. They sort of remind me of Tibetan Miracle Seeds, with their airy, abstract, not-quite-right vibe. But, even though it isn't jazz, and I wouldn't know what genre to put them in, you can tell from the beginning that these guys have serious jazz theory education. It's SO much fun and simple and yet still to intricate. As a music theory nerd I appreciate their stuff a lot. \n\n*I AM SAM* and *Sun And Moon* by Sam Kim --  I can completely and honestly say that I don't have any words for these albums, at least specific songs, which is why I saved them for last. Out of all the immense amount of music I grew up listening to and listen to today, I can confidently say I wouldn't be me without Sam Kim's music. Definitely music to put on late at night when you get in bed and turn of the light, in your headphones. Despite the few instruments used in his music, the emotion and dimension is unreal, at least to me. Harmonies and melodies and movements and progressions, down to his perfect execution and his smooth, white chocolate vocals. That's all the words I have for him, his music changed my life. If you don't listen to anything else on my list, listen to him. <3\n\nHope your adventure to new music goes well!", "created_utc": "1642998717.0", "edited": "False", "id": "htza46b", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_sal9yd", "parent_id": "t3_sal9yd", "score": "1", "subreddit": "Music", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1u"}, {"author": "murdawgles", "body": "Irish!", "created_utc": "1642800625.0", "edited": "False", "id": "htnju4v", "is_submitter": "True", "link_id": "t3_s9lcry", "parent_id": "t1_htnjr6n", "score": "2", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "murdawgles", "body": "I'm getting this from the library this coming week!

What if it is something about someone that's striking first which you then grow to love? Attraction is largely based on what we value in someone or something. If you value their appearance it's likely everything else about them will become important to you too. And just the same if someone isn't conventionally attractive, maybe you even didn't think in the beginning they were attractive at all, but if their character is respectable you're more likely to find them attractive. But then again, all this to say, you can never really know who and what about said who will attract you, until it does. One can try to rationalize it, but it's easy to get off on a tangent. \n\nOn one slightly different note, scent is very very important, especially in your subconscious. Brains can, (don't ask me how, I don't know, please google it) actually pick up on the dna and immunities someone has, and automatically places more attraction in those with opposite as your own, in the hopes that offspring will be the healthiest possible.

Please know with my response I mean only encouragement. \n\nKnow that there are always unconventional ways to learn what you want to learn, *especially* with music. If you aren't looking for the piece of paper that says you learned it, you can most definitely learn it in your own time. Search and ask for resources. If you like to sing, find a choir to join, or even just talk with the director about any resources they might know of. Look for books. Being a musician and not just a composer, there are more likely ways to work with others in organizations and groups to produce music. Even so, the arts are much more experience-oriented and relationship-oriented. If you have the talent and skill, a lot of positions won't be as concerned that you don't have a paper that says you took classes: they're more concerned with your abilities.\n\nI understand you well because I am in the same situation. Unless I get massive scholarships, I won't get to go to a university to make my dream come true. But, if I am okay with not having a paper but getting and seeking out experiences and studies on my own, I can get just as far as I would in college, and I can take my time and learn how I need to learn. \n\nI hope this is helpful or at least encouraging.
