I\u2019m an American who actually just got back from Austria, I moved there for a year and spoke literally no German when I started (now at B1 so deeeefinitely not close to fluent but i can join convos). I\u2019ll say a bit about the experience\n\nFirst off, the Austrian accents are really fucking hard to understand, at least from my point of view. I remember I went to Berlin and genuinely felt like a German god because I could suddenly make out everyone\u2019s words. Good news is younger people (30 and under) will restrict their accent to hoch Deutsch (high German, aka Berlin accent which is like our version of proper English) when they hear you having troubles. \n\nIf you\u2019re in Vienna, I can promise you that 70-85% of people will know English pretty well, it honestly made it hard for me to practice German with how often they switched when they heard my accent/mistakes. \n\nBy far far far the best thing you can do is get a friend there willing to practice with your German. In reality, you need to study yourself to A2 level first so you can have a conversation and give them something to work with, but then it\u2019ll be possible. Try to do as much as you can now so the \u201ceasy\u201d part of just talking you can do there because life will already be so stressful. If you\u2019re in wien go to SprachCafe (languagecafe) it\u2019s a free cafe that puts tables out of volunteers who just speak with people in whatever language they want to learn, and they always have a large amount of German tables (that do fill up so be early)\n\nBeyond that enjoy the ride! Try not to get frustrated with the language, it\u2019s a hard one but really rewarding, and the most spoken language in Europe if I\u2019m not mistaken, and by some really well put together countries. Realize that you\u2019re opening doors to Austria, Germany, Switzerland, northern Italy, Luxembourg, Belgium, and pockets of many other countries! Enjoy it, you\u2019re gonna have a cool time!\n\nOh, and buy Seedlang! Best learning app there is for almost any language by what I\u2019ve heard, and it\u2019s exclusively for German. It\u2019s ran by this team called easy German that has sooooo much material in so many easy formats with differing level of clarity and accents that I genuinely think you could get fluent with Seedlang, some easy German podcasts/videos, and some immersion", "created_utc": "1660172775.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ijsag43", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_wl6pnz", "parent_id": "t3_wl6pnz", "score": "12", "subreddit": "German", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qq51"}, {"author": "bulldog89", "body": "Shit man stuff like this is where you gotta realize how fucking little people on Reddit know about things.

And I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019ve been a bit jaded because 40% of the time I l tell people I\u2019m American, it starts a huge argument where I would have to apologize and lament on my government and circumstances that I don\u2019t have control over and that also are not the whole reality of living in America. I genuinely do feel you guys get the worst news or us over there, again it\u2019s so large that you can find terrible things happening at any point of the day, which doesn\u2019t excuse it but helps form the context of why you can get these news stories. \n\nAnd for your comment, maybe it\u2019s because of that jadedness but also it wasn\u2019t really simply pointing out my issues, which again happen so frequently that it is aggravating on times. A comment about Western Europeans only possibly being able to lose an argument to Americans if they could pull something other than an age old unrealistic fear puts it in the light that you all truly live better and higher lives and that we\u2019re stuck regurgitating the same old phrases. \n\nAnd again, it\u2019s not some huge contest, it\u2019s all arbitrary and there\u2019s different places for different people, but I will say there are certain great advantages being in the US does give \n\nAnd for your points I will say to the natural parks, of course all those areas have them, I mean we weren\u2019t comparing Asia and Australia but of course they do. And Europe has amazing landscape, geography, and nature as well, but I truly think the size and scope and variety of the American parks and protection of them is unparalleled. And even if you don\u2019t agree, we also have such amazing animals that are not only in these parks but also in other still wild areas, which is why I gave us the edge in that.\n\nAC obviously was not for assassins creed but for air conditioning, which especially given the heat wave by you guys right now shows the fair point the benefit it brings in increasing livability and saving lives (definitely hurts the environment as people note but that is such a small resource drain for the benefit of lives and living conditions that there are so many other pollutants to do use on before that, especially with how green electricity can become)\n\nThere are definitely nice people all over the world but we do have a very talkative, welcoming culture, much like Spain I honestly would say. So I do count it as a benefit to being here and being able to live in that community.\n\nAs far as the economic jobs go, I\u2019ll be honest I am not nearly educated enough in law and policy to comment on the status of all the different European states and the us states. And then if we\u2019re going to just say we\u2019re comparable on that I can totally accept it so I will leave it there. \n\nAs far as universities go I will stand on the ground that the top quarter of American universities are exemplarary in terms of the research, funding, and opportunities for students. Our universities are net exporters of academia, in the terms that many more of our students are international who take the education back home as compared to Americans who do the opposite, and by almost all metric we are by far the country with the most \u201celite\u201d universities (even when compared to other populous countries like China for instance) of course our colleges are expensive, but not all are. There are incredibly cheap and affordable state schools or community colleges or trade schools. They are there for those who want that path, it\u2019s just not spoken about much. \n\nAlso saying we can compete with japans manga culture is a gross understatement, im not even going to argue the influence and contribution of American media \n\nBut the last thing again is the social issues. These \u201cgrave social issues\u201d that we have is present with you guys as well. Racism is not an american thing, Christian fundamentalism here is more us, but so many of these issues are prevalent in Europe as well. \n\n\nAnd maybe again we\u2019re arguing different things, which is totally fine. I took the basis of the arguement as Europeans could not lose an arguement about their homeland at all because they have a few gotcha moments they can pull on america, while maybe you thought it was purely healthcare. We lose to I would say to a good amount of European nations in that regard, but there\u2019s also so much we do get. If we compare one country to one country, Spain for instance, I would bring up our better climates, definitely better economic opportunities (for non professionals as well, most if not all educated jobs, even though I\u2019m sure your working hours are a bonus in some professions), but now that I type this all out it makes me apathetic. This comment won\u2019t change either of our minds, and it does make me sad a bit. I believe Americans generally have an optimistic viewpoint of many European countries, and find a lot of the different things about them interesting and fascinating, and it\u2019s always so tough to see that the other viewpoint seems to be one of scorn.", "created_utc": "1659378599.0", "edited": "False", "id": "iijfn6b", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_wd9bqa", "parent_id": "t1_iiiplhu", "score": "3", "subreddit": "BikiniBottomTwitter", "subreddit_id": "t5_3deqz"}, {"author": "bulldog89", "body": "Granted man, a lot of the US criticism is fair, but man you have to admit that europe is racist, in my opinion just as much of not more so than the US.

For instance, Clint Capela, an NBA player from Switzerland, wrote articles how it wasn\u2019t until he came to the US that he realized he could have a voice about being black and what it meant. \n\nOr for instance being black in Italy, it\u2019s an incredibly hard social barrier to get over.

It\u2019s very heavily invested in frat life and sorority life, and while that may be Indiana university in general, it\u2019s especially prominent in kelley. I\u2019m personally not a fan at all of them, but I will say if you do go here you should make a point to try and get into the business fraternities, AKPsi and DSP. They\u2019re incredibly focused towards improving their members business standing, and there was a marked difference in my friends jobs from who was in those fraternities and who wasn\u2019t.\n\nThe school also takes damn good care of their kelley students. No Friday classes, longer breaks (right now they don\u2019t start class for another week), and so many perks that will make the rest of the campus (jokingly) hate you. \n\nBut holy shit just remembered, it is VERY possible that you don\u2019t get into kelley, and that\u2019s a one shot opportunity. I\u2019d say a very significant portion of none DA students don\u2019t get in after their first year, and then you\u2019d be royally screwed. You\u2019d have left your California home, stuck in indiana, not even in the major you want, paying out of state tuition and scrambling for some informatics job. So I\u2019m trying to emphasize this as much as I can, understand that going to college is one of the craziest events of your life, and you\u2019ll have to seriously ask yourself if you\u2019re willing and able to put all the insane distractions aside and focus on these really hard classes. Cause if you honestly think you might have trouble with that then I\u2019d say just cross kelley off already. One of my closest friends got super into the parties/college fun activities when he first got here, didnt get into kelley, and now he\u2019s leaving college with that being the biggest regret of his life.

If black doesn\u2019t either sacrifice their d file pawn to block your bishop, or move their h file pawn to h6, you may have your trap. The most common move is they\u2019ll develop their kingside knight to f6, which is when you now move your knight to g5, so both your bishop and knight are attacking that f7 pawn. (If he doesn\u2019t move kingside knight out it just takes one extra development move of moving d2 pawn up so your dark square bishop can protect the knight on g5 from the queen. \n\nThis is why the f7 pawn is so weak. It is only protected by one piece, the king, so attacking it already can potentially put the king in check, and even if he does take it with the king, he can\u2019t castle and puts his king out in the open, which drastically shifts the game in your favor. \n\nSo then you have the option of attacking with the knight and forking the queen and rook, or you can attack with the bishop, force the king to move and lose castle, and retreat. Forking with the knight and taking the rook is probably the best move because it\u2019s a 5 point swing and forces king to try and castle queen side. \n\nI\u2019m sure a video will explain this better, but hope this helps!", "created_utc": "1605795834.0", "edited": "False", "id": "gctx6os", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_jwgjvm", "parent_id": "t1_gctvfze", "score": "1", "subreddit": "chess", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhr7"}, {"author": "bulldog89", "body": "My first ever opening I used was the Italian game.

During test day, it's such a hard topic to start dry on, I wish we could've started on P/S or something less concrete. I felt completely overwhelmed, tagged 13/48 questions, BUT, when I went back with my 5 minutes, I looked at my first 6 and thought that the answers I chose were the ones I would choose again, so I'm somewhat OK with this section. I got a 130 on the last two FLs I took, and I would be extremely happy to keep that on this section.\n\nCARS: Motherfucking CARS, this is what gives me the most trouble. I think I tried too hard to not rush and did the opposite, I took too long. I felt awful about this one, which especially hurts because it was my favorite section, getting a 131 and 132 on the last two tests. This is where my score will be broken, hoping for a 130 on it. \n\nB/B: This is the one section I've lost no sleep over. I felt it was almost too easy, and I think flagged only two questions here. I got 131 on both of my last two tests, and I think I'll end up around there again with this one.\n\nP/S: I don't even know what to say. I ALWAYS feel like this section is a breeze, like why the hell do they even bother testing us over this, and always hit 128-129 here. I did multiple anki decks, a million practice questions, but it's always the same story. I felt freaking amazing during this but I do everytime so I'm not falling for it again. I hit 130 on my last test here, and am just praying I do it again.\n\nSo overall\nPessimistic : 516-517\nRealistic: 518-519\nOptimistic: 520+\n\nI honestly don't feel that good on the test, but I've seen how everyone feels they blew it, and I refuse to be the premed who bitch about how they failed only to get a good score.

And lastly, but this is the most important one, hands down, go through your test again. And I mean really go through it, read the passage, and make all the connections you can before you even get to the questions. Like if you\u2019re reading a B/B passage, and you see that a protein dimer is covalently bonded, you think cysteine residues that break apart in reducing SDS before you even get to the questions.

Especially the test reviews, properly reviewing, writing down mistakes and learning the logic is why people see 3 and 4 point jumps in week to week sessions.

It is entirely possible to jump a FL score 10 points in three weeks, but possible doesn\u2019t mean easy. You have 21 days to make or break a big part of your dream here, so every second counts. I don\u2019t know what you did as far as content review, but these FLs are your biggest help, so abuse them. Go over this FL from the very beginning, and read that passage over like it\u2019s your first time, connecting the dots while you do it. You see something say covalently bonded protein in B/B? You think \u201ccysteine sulfur attatchment, which can be broken apart by reducing conditions\u201d BEFORE you even get to the questions. It\u2019ll take at least a whole day to get through the test, but that\u2019s what you\u2019re going to have to do. It\u2019ll help you understand and recognize the AAMC format and pattern, which is legitimately HALF the battle. Half the job has been content review, which has taken months and months of work, but you can get this other half down in just three weeks. CARS is the only one, at least for me, that\u2019s tricky to review, as in my opinion you just recognize the sentences you were supposed to instead of learning. You\u2019re actually doing great in it, but if you want to improve theres always room for improvement , although i think your time would be MUCH better spent working on the other sections. This is my method so don\u2019t take it as sacred,  but you should do 5-6 passages a day for practice. Jackwestin, and of course AAMC if you somehow haven\u2019t done it yet. And when you do CARS, scream every single adjective in your head, I made a comment about it earlier if you want to look at my history. \n\nOn top of that, you\u2019ll have to do some content. At this point I\u2019m not sure what your weakness is or whatnot, so it\u2019s up to you to figure that out, cause you have enough time to fix it, but just barely. Anki decks for P/S can have you at a 128-130 by 3 weeks for sure, or a solid B/B and C/P review can grab you some solid points too. Doing those 5-6 CARS passages will get you a solid 1-2 points higher imo.\n\nAnd while I want to say that don\u2019t take this end all from me as fact, hell I haven\u2019t even submitted any secondaries yet so what do I know. There are numerous 499s that are in med school right now, so you\u2019ll have a chance no matter what. But I believe in never counting on being the exception, you have 3 weeks and the power to make sure that you are the standard for being the accepted student. These next 21 days are going to be hell, but it\u2019s 3 weeks to force your dreams into being a reality, I believe in you, I know you\u2019re going to do it.", "created_utc": "1593794183.0", "edited": "False", "id": "fwthao4", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_hkfqkg", "parent_id": "t3_hkfqkg", "score": "2", "subreddit": "Mcat", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saxp"}, {"author": "bulldog89", "body": "UEarth is insane, and maybe my favorite prep tool, but at your point it may not be worth it.
