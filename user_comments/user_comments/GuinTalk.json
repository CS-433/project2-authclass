Same thing with push-ups: do 5-10 pushups, then flip to your back and rest.

Stick to it and perhaps increase duration or reps per set every week or two. \n\nThis is not like bicep curls or bench press where you can push harder and be sore for a few days.

The relationship is completely unnatural and I think we should expect it to feel confusing and a long list of other feelings towards it.\n\nA therapist can be too involved and opinionated or too cold and distant. Where is the balance? And trust still has to be earned regardless of this imaginary \u201csafe space\u201d that patients are supposed to buy into right away because of a piece of paper that the therapist has to prove they\u2019re trustworthy with our deepest insecurities, secrets, and shame.\n\nA healthy and compatible therapeutic relationship is just as difficult to find and build as it is with others. It\u2019s easy to say, \u201cfind a therapist to help you through this.\u201d What it actually entails is anxiety, research, patience, trial and error, wasted time and money, and fatigue.\n\nAnd some of us finally find a good one with who we eventually have to quit cold turkey and we\u2019re supposed to be magically okay with continuing the work with a brand new stranger and not allowed to contact our former confidant ever again. It seems having the same therapist for many years is not the norm due to people moving, insurance changes, job loss, residency, etc. \n\nI find it more unnatural for the patient and therapist to *not* develop feelings. If I don\u2019t notice some level of countertransference happening at least once in a while, I\u2019d question whether the therapist is even human. And if the patient doesn\u2019t get attached on some level to the therapist, my guess is the therapist may as well have been a journal or a wall to talk at.\n\nI understand there\u2019s different types of patients with varying needs and there\u2019s also so many therapeutic approaches. I\u2019m speaking from my perspective and experience with multiple psychiatrists (for talk therapy and not just meds) and therapists over the years. \n\nI have only one session left with my current one and it\u2019s completely absurd I have to say goodbye forever and it makes me angry.
