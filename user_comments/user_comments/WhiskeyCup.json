It's significant that Putin recognised China's \"concerns\" regarding the invasion and why it was significant for China to abstain when the UN Security Council voted to condemn the invasion and condemn the forced annexation. **Edit** (forgot to add this): China plays the long game and knows war risks its growth which has already become precarious. And having friends like Russia may hurt China's diplomatic ties with Africa, which China is wanting to build an export market to and which has good reason to condemn imperialistic invasions.

And the peak of the spike was still no where near as high as the 70s or 80s which crime was rampant in Germany. \n\nOn the German language subreddit there was a screenshot showing two different headlines: one said \"nearly 200,000 living off our taxes!\" referencing the refugees getting benefits pretty much right away. The second one was 2-3 years later from the same newspaper saying \"150,000 Germans unemployed because of refugees!\" Like damn, if they get on the dole it's bad, if they get off the dole it's also bad. Btw, refugees are still treated as \"third country nationals\" under EU law , which means all things being equal, an employer has to show favor to the EU citizen and hire them first. So 150,000 Syrians getting a job \"over\" the Germans meant those Syrians were more well-qualified than the Germans who got overlooked. More impressive considering most Syrians weren't learning German before they came, so they got good enough in German in 2-3 years. \n\nAssuming that was even the case, many just open their own businesses. \n\nIt's not all roses and sunshine, of course. There is the issue of some Syrians refusing to integrate even a little, causing problems.

Women did all the domestic work while men worked the factories or the fields. Just as the women were dependent on the men for income, the men were dependent on the women to take care of all the domestic tasks that need to be done. Washing, buying food, preparing food, cleaning, watch the kids etc. \n\nBefore the 40 hour work week, men were often working 12 hour shifts or even longer. But by reducing the work day to 8 hours, it would not only employ many more workers, it would also give them the time to relax. [This](https://www.hacktheunion.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/8-hours.jpg) is a brochure arguing an 8 hour work day. Notice there's no time for chores and shit; it was assumed the wife would be doing that. Not implying women were expected to work all the time and the men could slack off- the labor movement was just from a man's point of view at the time. \n\nBut nowadays, there's not \"single income household\"- both partners NEED to work. Even with two parents combining resources, it can be tough to balance it all if you got kids. And people don't get married or even cohabitate like they used to. It's still common obviously, but not as frequent. \n\nThere is no wife to do all the domestic chores while you're being a wage-slave. So I don't think it's really that wild for the labor movement to demand shorter work weeks. Hell, the weekend should be extended by a day. \n\nIt has nothing to do with \"laziness being a virtue\", it's the fact that capitalists squeeze and squeeze you and you hardly have any time for yourself to do what needs to be done.", "created_utc": "1643309228.0", "edited": "False", "id": "huh2zmh", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_sdmdrq", "parent_id": "t3_sdmdrq", "score": "21", "subreddit": "stupidpol", "subreddit_id": "t5_hitz3"}, {"author": "WhiskeyCup", "body": "He's still some random kid.

If Russia invades Estonia they absolutely have to, for the sake of consistency regarding international law and their treaty. I wouldn't be surprised if Russia is stress-testing NATO's resolve to uphold the alliance and we need to ensure that there's a united front for NATO. \n\nAs for what's going on in Ukraine, I'm not really sure. The feeling here in Europe is that any kind of conflict, whether restricted to Ukraine or spills over to the Baltics or another NATO country, would lead to a wave of people trying to flee the conflict. That would put strains on economies and countries that are dealing with Covid and, let's be real, never really fully recovered from the sovreign debt crisis twelve years ago. So the vast majority of people here do not want war and it really does seem like only America wants a war. \n\nAs for working Americans, Ukraine is as abstract and remote a place in the world as Afghanistan. We spent over ten years there, poured in over a trillion dollars of money into it, let thousands of Americans and even more Afghan civilians die for absolutely nothing. It's no wonder most Americans would rather not get involved. \n\nIn the mean time Europe should absolutely form a formal military alliance. I get NATO is the main go-to partially cause it's already there and partially because the US is a member. But I think Europe should really get their own and certain countries *looks at Germany* should really invest in their militaries more. And also look at the big picture, rather than what benefits their own country.

I decided on a project at the end of the unit where they write a news report as if they were journalists in a book/ movie/ TV show and they were gonna write about it.

As you can see, these are little bricks building up to a house. \n\nI gave them about 1.5 weeks to go through the whole writing process with myself giving feedback. They were allowed to use their books and dicitonaries to special words. I had given them a rubric so they know what my expectations would be. Once they turned it in I made copies and distributed the reports randomly around the room. They had to read the report they got and rate it with a copy of the rubric I gave, and on the backside rate their own rubric. \n\nAs you can see, I used the book for a bit of guidance for grammar and theme but not so much for the vocabulary (even though we learned it anyways).

For background, I'm white and come from a pretty affluent family, I was pretty sheltered at the time from how different the lives of poor people in the US.\n\nI had applied to a volunteer program abroad and I needed a bunch of different shots, one of which was polio. At the private practice, they of course did not have the polio shot because it's practically extinct in the US. But I could get it from the public clinic in my county (where the vast majority of Medicaid recipiants get their healthcare. **Medicaid** is for poor people, **Medicare** for old people).\n\nFirst, the opening hours were from 8am to 6pm and only on weekdays. Not open on weekends. At the time I was a substitute teacher so I said \"ok I'll go tomorrow after work\" (3pm). Drive there, was basically told to come the NEXT morning because \"there's no way you can get an appointment today.\" Also I couldn't schedule an appointment.\n\nSo I the following week I had to block off a day, and thereby losing a day of pay (I think something like $80 at the time). I showed up at like noon because I decided to do some other errands that I could only do in the morning anyhow. When I show up to the clinic again, I'm told I can't be seen that day. At this point I'm pretty frustrated because I took off a day for work for this and I need to submit the paperwork for these vaccines soon. I ask how can I see a doctor if I'm not allowed to make an appointment? The dude told me to come when the doors opened.\n\nSo I take ANOTHER day off work and show up at 7:30. There is a crowd of people outisde. We all shuffle in when the doors open and we each take a number. I'm waiting for like two hours before my number is finally called. I speak to a lady and I tell her I'm just here for a polio vaccine and I show them the letter I got from the organisation as well as my insurance card (I was on mommy and daddy's insurance still). The lady looked at me like I was a child and said \"we only accept Medicaid here, if you don't have Medicaid you have to pay out of pocket.\" But don't worry, one dose of polio was $100. I guess it's so cheap cause the disease is just so rare and there's no money in it.\n\nSo she gives me a number and directs me to a different waiting room. I brought a book to read but I end up talking to some families there. There are literally entire families there. Mom, dad, and the kids. It's like a Tuesday and during the school year, but this was the only way they could get their kids' booster shots as well as for the parents to get their check ups. Better to lose one day of pay than five different days. Of course they did like me and had come multiple times until get were able to get in the door. The mom worked as a waitress at two diners and the dad was a roofer. The kids were two middle school age girls.\n\nI finally get my number called. I had been waiting something like 2.5 hours and I'm starving. The family I was talking to shared an apple with me (they knew to pack a lunch while waiting). I walk into the office and boom they do the shot and they stamp my documents. I'm going to leave but I have to stand in line AGAIN.\n\nI finally get to the same lady I saw at the beginning and this is when I pay her the hundred bucks. At this point I was wondering if they'd accept my debit card and force me to pay in cash.\n\nThis experience really showed me what a bubble I had been living in up to this point. Keep in mind, this was our PUBLIC service. I was out $260 ($100 for the dose, $160 for losing two days of work). I'm lucky that I didn't need anything urgent or have any children.\n\nI'm lucky that I come from a capitalist family and being just naturally healthy and never had any interactions with the private sector outside of regular check ups. Though I have friends who have had some pretty awful experiences with the private sector and they're financialy ruined despite coming from solidly middle class families like my own.

Every superpower has had citizens within it which wanted their countries to retreat from the world, or at least give more autonomy if not out right independence to colonies. \n\nNot to mention, the title is somewhat misleading in that it suggests if you're not absolutely thrilled about being a superpower, you advocate for isolationism. From a Marxist perspective, I think any genuinely leftist policy enacted by the US will trickle through to the periphery much quicker. \n\nAs is, any socialist revolution, even one towards Nordic-style social democracy, will be crushed. I don't think anyone here needs to be reminded of why America toppled the governments of Iran and many Latin American countries. Undeveloped countries in the so-called third world desperately need protectionist policies in order to build up and develop their economies. But between financial incentives of organisations like the World Bank and IMF, and occaisional, indirectly backed coups, these countries are stuck as the dumping ground. ((I'm aware how complicated this is, by the way, I'm just speaking plainly))\n\nAs is, only America can pull those same levers which are currently used for so much evil, to do some actual good in the world. There are some here in Europe who have a fantasy that the EU can become what the US failed to be (from a purely European perspective), but the reality is they can never and will never. Not for a lack of trying. At least not anytime soon. The only country, at the moment, which seems to be capable and willing to exert itself globally is China. I don't think that's a good thing. \n\nMaybe in 30+ years when the world is more pluricentric, there might be more possibility for genuinely progressive ideas to take hold and action to happen. One small way we've already seen is Europe and others taking on more aggressively ecological policies, largely because of Trump and European leaders realizing that they couldn't wait on the US to give direction anymore. At least they say they are. The new leader of the CDU mentoned \"the environment\" like once or twice in a speech, and it was \"the financial environment\"....\n\nTL;DR As a leftist, being a superpower has a ton of advantages, but only for as long as you are a superpower.

If you look at the finer details of UBI, at least when it's seriously being considered as policy, it's usually a backdoor to can other benefits such as disability benefits, childcare, and subsidised higher education. Theoretically, the only beneifts that one would have to get rid of due to just being redundant are unemployment benefits. But even if you keep all the usual welfare state mechanisms and implement UBI, my problem with UBI is mainly with the notion that we're gonna be automated fairly quickly. \n\nWhile I'm not an economist, loads of people who've studied econ think it's a fallacy that robots will \"take all the jobs\" and we can't imagine what other jobs there might be. Additionally, there are lots of jobs that we \\*can\\* automate but will likely not. If your parents and grandparents move into a nursing home or need elderly assistance, do you want a human watching them, or a robot? What do you think the majority of people would want? \n\nNot to mention, we desparately need to green the economy and our infrastructure (building wind turbines/ nuclear facilities, upgrade the electric grid, rework how to do recycling, make buildings more energy effecient etc) and that should've been done yesterday so we can't just wait around for automation. \n\nI'm not implying that UBI supporters think robots will save everyhting and we should wait around, I'm just pointing out our situation. One alternative policy that several economists such as Mark Blyth, Robert Reich, and Pavlina Tcherneva is a job guarantee (JG). \n\nThis is different from so-called \"workfare\" where one receives welfare benefits in exchange for labor, and can have a lot of the benefits of UBI plus more. Basically the the local government guarantees employment to any resident and the pay is based on skill and technical experience/ education of the person taking it with the lowest possible wage being low but liveable. Let's say $20/ hour. This would have more or less the same benefits as UBI since workers would always have an alternative job if their employer's pay and benefits don't satisfy their needs and be a good counter-cycle to economic downturns. \n\nThe additional benefits that JG has but UBI  lacks are: it prevents job skills from atrophying due to long-term unemployment, the government can more easily take up large-scale projects which require a lot of man-power (greening the infrastructure, for example). It also facilitates a \"societal spirit\" rather than the atomization of capitalism. \n\nIt's not as \"cost effecient\" as a UBI since you'd need to find everyone a position and assess their pay. But one thing that would really help would be to let a lot of the decisions regarding what job and for how much would be to let those descisions be largely decided locally, with virtually all funding coming from the central/ federal government. \n\nTL;DR I'm not totally against UBI, but I think a JG should be more seriously considered and a possible transition to a UBI in the future.", "created_utc": "1613816663.0", "edited": "False", "id": "go3waku", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_lnvdt6", "parent_id": "t3_lnvdt6", "score": "2", "subreddit": "SocialDemocracy", "subreddit_id": "t5_2sjw0"}, {"author": "WhiskeyCup", "body": "If anything, we Americans need to become more aware of domestic policies of our allies (Europe, Japan, Korea, Taiwan, etc) to broaden our fucking horizons on what's possible.

But since many students might enter the school later than others, their English might be behind most others, so they hire \"English as Additional Language Teachers\", or EAL teachers, basically get them up to speed. For example, they will pull the kids with weaker English out of the English lit. courses to be in small groups together with the EAL teacher and they will cover the same book, but with more focus on grammar and vocabulary. It's a bit similar to ESL teachers in public American schools for recently immigrated students.

Colleagues were visit every few months but I could not go since I was neither Russian nor Mongolian (am American).  Sometimes the Tuvans would come to my school and the first time that happened my Mongolian colleagues said, \"hey, some Russians will be at the school!\" and I thought European Russians.  But when I got to school and saw some other Asian looking people and the teachers said, \"those are Russians\", I learned about the Tuvans. I got to hang out with some of the Tuvan teachers and me and the history teachers (Mongolian) took them to kareoke and had a grand time. Despite it being a Turkic language, it sounded a lot like Mongolian to me and there were some words I understood, but for the most part the Tuvans and Mongolians would use Russian as a bridge language. I only met one Tuvan who knew English pretty well, I wish I hadn't lost their email but these things happen. Some of the Tuvans knew Mongolian because they grew up near the Mongolian border. \n\nSome interesting things I learned was that they're awfully similar to Mongolians.

If this was a high schooler (or anyone) wanting to study in the US but their first language wasn't English, the TOEFL exam is perfect for that.

They can be kinda expensive but IMO it's a good investment. You can even use it to tutor future students. \n\nThe thing to keep in mind is the TOEFL exam was designed to test international students coming to the US to study at university. I think it's somewhat inappropriate to think that TOEFL scores will reflect performance at a US high school or international school, depending on the kid's age, but that's my opinion. There are only four kinds of questions: \n\na) listen and oral response\n\nb) listen and written response\n\nc) read and oral response\n\nd) read and written response\n\nAll the questions either involve reading a quasi academic text (like something about the American Civil War) or some exchange that is typical for US university students (conversations with a professor or another student). Usually they only listen once or given 60 seconds to read and then 30-40 seconds to think of their oral response. I can't remember if it's allowed during the test but during tutor sessions I encouraged students to write notes of what they wanted to say in that 30-40 seconds. \n\nIn addition to the four types listed above, the participant is asked to analyze the text/ reading either by stating their own *opinion* or stating what the *text* says. So the participant might listen to a conversation between a professor and a student who is struggling in a course and the professor gives advice. The question could ask the participant to either a) state the advice the professor gives or b) give their own opinion of the situation, and why they think that. They don't have to be right, just be able to articulate a thought that is relevant to the question at hand. \n\nWith that knowledge in mind, I would often drill my tutees and simulate how the test will be administered as realistically as possible.  If the tutee is doing well with writing but struggling with speaking, I would focus more on those questions to identify weaknesses they have in that area. Additionally, I would teach them how to identify if the question was asking them to state their own opinion or describe what happened.  This is a major part of the test. \n\nWhen we weren't doing drills or providing feedback, I would also encourage them to use flashcard based on the [academic word list](https://www.victoria.ac.nz/lals/resources/academicwordlist).   \n\nI would also encourage you to teach them strategies to pick apart academic words by morphs to infere a possible definition for when they encounter words they do not know. Like if my learner knows the word \"dependent\" and knows that \"co-; con-; com-\" prefixes imply togetherness or oneness, then they might have a good idea what \"codependent\" is even if they have never seen it. \n\nHope this helps and good luck. \n\nEdit: Strategies to describe words or phrases when you can't think of the English word is also very helpful. It's ok to admit \"I don't know the word, but it's...\" and proceed to describe the word as best you can.

There are also Ablative, Directional, and Comminicative verbs as well.  Like the verb \"asuuh\" (to ask) is an Ablative verb.  Ablative case is marked with \"-aas\" on the end of the ~~verb~~ noun and just means \"from\" something.  So I can tell someone \"nadaas daraa asuugaarai\" (please ask me later) and it would literally mean something like \"from me later please ask\".
