I\u2019ve messed around shooting other people\u2019s handguns and it seems like you need a very consistent presentation from the holster to make them faster to acquire visually. I\u2019m kinda iffy on cops/military carrying red dots on their pistols because I\u2019ve seen some really terrible performance from LE/Mil at defensive handgun courses. I\u2019m not sure if red dots could or will hinder people who don\u2019t regularly practice drawing and presenting from a holster or going from low ready to firing (searching for the dot seems to take more time than finding the front sight). I also have never seen anyone on forums mention that there is still a mechanical offset that may need to be accounted for depending on the mounting system if you need to make a headshot/shoot a partially obscured target. If you have a decent amount of training they seem awesome. But I\u2019m just not sure if a lot of people carrying them are doing that tbh.", "created_utc": "1651966004.0", "edited": "False", "id": "i7qhala", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_ujz7nz", "parent_id": "t1_i7qd7j1", "score": "2", "subreddit": "CCW", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s4mc"}, {"author": "DarK_DMoney", "body": "Okay.
