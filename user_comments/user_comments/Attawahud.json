Try having those conversations in your target language!\n* Learning a language often teaches you new cultural social skills. You may start to notice that eventually your social skills are better in your target language than in your native language.\n* Try to find words relating to your special interests in your target language. How cool is it to infodump in a foreign language?\n* Words may not always have a direct translation.

Even though I struggle to answer these questions too, I\u2019ll try to answer them from the way I see it.\n\n> how do you tell when someone is your friend? \n\nI guess they actually enjoy spending time with you and doing activities with you. There\u2019s reciprocity in contact. It\u2019s not just you inviting them to hang out, but it\u2019s also them inviting you to hang out. They won\u2019t treat you differently when around other people. You feel safe sharing stuff about your life with them.\n\n> What distinguishes friends from acquaintances? \n\nEven though there are overlaps, I would say the main difference is that - contrary to acquaintances - you do meet up with friends outside of the environment you know them from. You for instance invite them at home, in a park or in a pub. I personally have a lot of people from my job, university or sports club that I like interacting with, but I wouldn\u2019t (yet) meet up with them out outside of the environment where I met them. Acquaintances can become friends however. But for me as well, even though I\u2019d love to turn some acquaintances into friends, I suppose my autism makes that more difficult sometimes.\n\n> When can you start referring to someone as your friend? \n\nThat\u2019s a very personal thing. For me it definitely is after having done some activities with them and having invited them to my home a few times.\n\n> And how often are you supposed to hang out with a friend?\n\nIt depends. If it\u2019s someone you see quite often, I\u2019d say approximately try to do it weekly/once every two weeks at least I guess? More often if you like to and have the energy. But if you and your friend are really busy or live quite far apart less often will do as well. Ideally in that case try to maintain the friendship by messaging them sometimes. But honestly maintaining friendship with people I don\u2019t see very often is something I struggle with quite a lot.\n\nHope this helps!

Other than covid vaccines, we just started vaccinating target groups against Monkeypox. I wouldn\u2019t be that scared of another lockdown because:\n- there is a vaccine right away: the smallpox vaccine. It\u2019s 85% effective in preventing Monkeypox and the other 15% of cases makes the disease extremely mild.\n- it\u2019s much harder to get infected with monkeypox compared to covid. Although some evidence exists the disease spreads a little bit through the air, it\u2019s mostly spread by intensive bodily contact like sex, hugging and kissing.\n- the disease is less dangerous than covid, although it is really painful if you do contract it, which is why we care\n- during covid we were most concerned about the elderly. All of them have already had the smallpox vaccine in their childhood (the evidence is often still visible in the form of a little scar on their shoulder or foot)\n\nLast but not least: monkeypox seems to infect predominantly gay men. This is because they are more likely to have more different sex partners compared to heterosexuals. Because of this, MSMs (men who have sex with men) are the key demographic that we are vaccinating currently.\n\nOne might argue, homosexuality is illegal/socially stigmatised in most of the Middle East, would that mean that the region will be less affected? Yes and no. Traditional cultural/religious values like faithfulness do indeed help curb the spread of STDs. However, those same values push MSMs underground. This way, it is more difficult for gay men to seek help or get access to treatment, therefore the disease does in fact impact society under the radar. This is also the case with HIV/AIDS by the way.\n\nFinal words: take a break from the news headlines sometimes.

For more information on this kind of stuff, follow [@sailorrooscout](https://twitter.com/sailorrooscout?s=21&t=JG9-BCeU_HP0b7jxTfhA5Q) on Twitter. An actual scientist and vaccine researcher who worked on the Moderna vaccine and posts about this stuff frequently. \n\nAlso keep in mind that new stuff keeps coming. Pfizer pills (Paxlovid) further slashing down hospitalisations after getting infected, future nose spray vaccines that can combat infection better, uniform vaccines that work on every variant and vaccines that are more durable than the current.\n\nStill, I think I kind of understand your worries. In another comment you said that you\u2019re from Romania. I know that in Romania and Bulgaria the vaccination rate lags quite far behind Western Europe. Over here in the Netherlands the rate is like 90% and well over 96% of the population has at least some antibodies. \n\nAs a result, we don\u2019t see that many hospitalisations here anymore as we\u2019d see in earlier waves, despite having more infections. Covid is not the flu. However, thanks to vaccines, we brought down the severity/mortality of the virus significantly. With that, restrictive anti-covid measures become increasingly difficult to justify. The idea that vaccines would make covid completely fade away was quite unrealistic from the start, so basically we have to learn to live with the virus as soon as your country is immunised well enough. Zero deaths and hospitalisations is impossible. What is acceptable is a societal question. Different countries have different answers to that question. Japan remains vigilant, whereas my country has basically no covid measures left. \n\nIs it selfish for (young) people who had to sacrifice so much during lockdowns and are now vaccinated 3x to explore their freedoms again after two years?

While in Sarajevo, I decided that I wanted to visit Srebrenica, so I did some research and drove the long and bumpy road from the capital to the east. Visiting places that have witnessed tragic events is something I'm really interested in. I've also been to Auschwitz and Chernobyl. It's sometimes called dark tourism, but I feel like that term implies that I would want to go there for sensationalist reasons. In reality, I'm just really interested in modern history, I want to learn more, and lastly to pay respects.\n\nAlthough we often refer to Srebrenica, the old Dutchbat base is actually situated in Poto\u010dari. The town of Srebrenica is a few kilometres further down the road, which is also worth visiting.\n\nThe old Dutchbat base is now a memorial site/museum. The permanent exhibition there was designed by memorial site Kamp Westerbork in the Netherlands. In the compound, remnants of the Dutchbat era are still very visible, including Dutch graffiti on the walls as well as the office of general Karremans. There also is a movie screening every hour or so, which shows a 30-minute documentary about the Srebrenica genocide. It's quite graphic and I sat next to an older woman who probably had relatives killed in this genocide and was visibly struggling to watch the film. It was truly fighting against the tears there. You'll learn about gruesome details there (body parts belonging to one person burried in different mass graves, mines burried alongside bodies to \"surprise\" those trying to find the truth\") that I had not heard of before coming there.\n\nThe cemetary is straight accross the road. While there, the scale of the genocide becomes apparent. Over 6000 men are burried there. About a quarter of the victims are still missing, and remains are still being found. Even then: some bodies of the victims are relatively complete, others maybe consist of a single bone. It's difficult to comprehend all of this. I also saw family members there visiting the grave of their relative(s). Of which a mother sitting in between two graves, praying for their murdered son and husband. It really gave me the feeling of the scale of this genocide, and how lively and contemporary history can be.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend anyone to visit Srebrenica in their lives. Although it is quite a remote place to visit, it almost feels like a duty as a human being to pay my respects there and remember what happened their for generations to come. Especially because there are some people still denying this genocide, despite all evidence collected by organisations like the ICMP.", "created_utc": "1649408343.0", "edited": "False", "id": "i3vlcig", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_tyw5g6", "parent_id": "t1_i3vhw91", "score": "39", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i"}, {"author": "Attawahud", "body": "I think it's great your school included this important event in the history curriculum, but unfortunately it means your school belongs to the group [of the few schools](https://nos.nl/collectie/13844/artikel/2330875-te-weinig-aandacht-voor-genocide-srebrenica-in-geschiedenisonderwijs) that does", "created_utc": "1649406630.0", "edited": "False", "id": "i3vj7d4", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_tyw5g6", "parent_id": "t1_i3vivjx", "score": "7", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i"}, {"author": "Attawahud", "body": "I think [this video](https://youtu.be/ymf5p3LbCAE) explains what happened very well. \n\nRecently, the movie \u201cQuo vadis Aida\u201d about the genocide was released.

In my opinon that's wrong. It's merely a definition of racism invented in some sociology departments of universities. It holds no legal value. Apart from that, I think it abandons any nuance and quite literally dumbifies a complex and grave problem like racism into a black/white issue. There are some people in society, unfortunately often teachers or celebrities, that push this definition. Probably a really vocal minority though.

I\u2019m an administrator at a vaccine facility in the Netherlands, and I can for sure answer this question (partially)\n\nIn the Netherlands, past policy meant that those recovered from covid only needed one shot. However, many people now have problems travelling. Getting a booster shot doesn\u2019t always solve the problem, as some countries really want to see 2/2 or 3/3 with the booster, rather than 2/1 or something. I honestly don\u2019t know the UK\u2019s policy on this.\n\nWhat your girlfriend could do, is go to a vaccine facility and ask for the second dose, rather than the booster. You can just walk in at many places without appointment. Admins like me should know about this issue, I\u2019ve had 2 people so far come up to me who opted for the second shot rather than the booster. If they don\u2019t know, ask them to call their AC. If the vaccine is Pfizer, it\u2019s only an administrative thing, not a different vaccine/dosage. But it still can make a big difference entering a country.

Kom op zeg.\n- afbraak rechtsstaat. Versneld onder Rutte. In de Raad van Europa staan we op dezelfde zorgelijke lijstjes als Malta en Hongarije.\n\nLaat ik ook nog iets positiefs zeggen: hij is extreem charismatisch en weet hoe hij dit uit moet spelen. Heb hem vaak genoeg rond zien lopen in Den Haag en gaat echt de interactie aan met mensen in plaats van alleen de pers.\n\nTot slot, al zou Rutte de absolute God Emperor der Nederlanden zijn, vind ik nog dat hij er te lang zit.
