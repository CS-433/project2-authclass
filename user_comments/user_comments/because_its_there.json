[This picture](http://moblog.net/media/r/a/r/rareaquaticbadger/fun-with-long-exposures-2.jpg) may help -- the woman is barely moving, but you'll notice her face is a little blurry. For the most part, though, she's a still object in the photo. Many other people are relatively still and thus fairly consistent light exposure, but they're moving around enough that they're blurred. Then you've also got these weird blurry artifacts (see the bottom half + right quarter or so of the picture). It doesn't look right, but you can't make out a person.\n\nSo in OP's image, it's the same. The red light is bright -- enough photons hit the camera's sensor that even for a short period of time, they remain in the final image. On the other hand, the person holding the light isn't emitting/reflecting much light and therefore they don't show up. Technically, if you were able to compare this picture to a hypothetical image taken without them in it, there would be a *slight* difference in exposure, but you likely wouldn't be able to perceive it.\n\nLonger exposures give you the ability to fade out people and other moving objects.

I had to branch out to other tools. That's fine, but if they want to keep people engaged in their product beyond \"Being a child, he is small,\" their education has to be better than it is. Conjugation isn't really covered very well (IMHO), vocabulary is fairly limited, etc.\n3. **No language exchange.** They have the user base.

The above link shows the progress we've made in only three years - from around 15% error rate to sub-6%, better than humans can do.\n\nThe second component is taking that textual data and translating it into text in another language. We're still not perfect, but we're getting better all the time. (And, to boot, people aren't perfect either.)

Any clue how it is Facebook is worth hundreds of billions of dollars yet doesn't charge you a dime for their service? (Hint: they're being creepy as hell.)\n\nThe unfortunate reality is that when competitors give away something for \"free\" in exchange for tons of data about their users, it's hard to sell a product and not collect data; everyone will say, \"Why should I pay $X for a product from Such-and-Such Corp when I can get it for free from So-and-So Inc?\"\n\nAgain, I don't think Microsoft is \"against\" Linux. In the '90s? Absolutely, I think they were. '00s? Probably (though I paid less attention then). However, Microsoft's bread and butter isn't Windows anymore. It's productivity (Office), cloud (Azure), and more. And if everyone's running Android, it makes sense for Microsoft to meet customers where they are and provide an Office client for Android. If they're running an Ubuntu server or want to do Hadoop stuff, it makes sense for Microsoft to provide those offerings in Azure -- which the company does.\n\nAlso, the whole \"enemy\" thing is a drastic oversimplification. Amazon has their Amazon Video service which competes with Netflix. However, Amazon also [powers Netflix's servers on AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/case-studies/netflix/).

Still am a vim die-hard.) My previous team had dozens of engineers doing plenty of FOSS work.\n\nHow is running bash on Windows in any way anti-Linux? It's so *pro-Linux* it's ridiculous. And I think it's a bit unfair to say that not open-sourcing Minecraft is particularly bad, too. Visual Studio supports developing on a number of FOSS-community languages (eg, Python), Xamarin is now completely free for people that want to do cross-platform development (*a la* the JVM).\n\nFrankly, Microsoft tried - and succeeded for many years - doing the closed platform thing.

If you look at housing as an investment, I think you become inclined to think about what *other people* want and not what *you* want. But it's **your** house!\n\nI don't think you can rely any more on a tiny house appreciating in value than you can a traditional house. From a pure numbers perspective, if you can lock down the issue of where you're going to park the home (say, on a friend's property or renting cheaply from someone), then I think the finances can really work out in your favor for a tiny home. Even if you only plan on being there for a couple years, you'll save a ton.\n\nSpeaking as a homeowner, there's a lot of money and effort that goes into owning a home, and most non-homeowners (especially soon-to-be or recent high school and college grads) don't really think about. Just straight-up costs in addition to the mortgage:\n\n* [PMI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenders_mortgage_insurance)\n* Property taxes\n* Utilities (gas, electrical, water, sewer, garbage, recycling, phone, cable/satellite, internet)\n* HOA fees (if you're so unfortunate as to be in that situation; luckily, I haven't been)\n* Yard maintenance (fertilizer, watering, mowing, edging, etc.)\n* Miscellaneous maintenance (re-sealing blacktop, fixing siding after a hail storm, frequently replacing burned out light bulbs, etc.)\n\nThen there's all the *work* (often with costs involved, and some reproduced from above) that goes into it, such as mowing the lawn, weeding, edging, shoveling snow, and so on. I think for this category, it's more a matter of the scale of things. Do you want to be maintaining a 2500 or 3000 sq ft house? Or something 1/10th that size? From day one of owning my home, I only used compact fluorescent light bulbs, which supposedly last a really long time. Even so, I was **constantly** replacing them throughout the house.

We moved halfway across the country, moving from a 3000 sq ft house to about half that. The reality was that there was NO WAY we could bring all of our crap with us unless we stored it somewhere. We looked at storage options in Seattle, and it was very expensive. This led her to the painful realization that much of what we had must be discarded in some way. We had a garage sale, posted things on craigslist, gave to friends, family or the people that rented our house. The remainder were donated to various charities, recycled, or thrown away.\n\nThat process was very hard for her. We'd stand in our utility/storage room (which had at least four shelving units that were PACKED), and she'd look around and say, \"there's nothing we need to get rid of.\" Went through things one by one deciding whether it should make the move with us. Do we need it? Do we want it, and if so, do we expect we'll use it soon? (It was in our storage room, so obviously it wasn't used terribly often.) And so on. After getting rid of half of all those items, something clicked with her: wow, we really *do* have a lot of things we don't need. We still had a ton of stuff that we moved, and since then, we've purged more things.\n\nI think, for us, there was a real learning process. The norm is to hoard items \"just in case\" -- like our six steak knives for a family of four (with two young children that shouldn't be using steak knives) or the two suits I had that my wife wanted me to hang onto in case I need to attend a funeral (seriously); to have specialty items -- like the small battery-powered milk frother we never used; to hang onto things out of some obligation -- like the dozens of picture frames that up until a few weeks ago were sitting in our storage room because they had been gifts or the innumerable cheap plastic toys that were given to my kids as gifts.

I constantly make the point to my wife that our nephews, siblings, parents, and friends don't need us to buy them anything. We're all very fortunate to have jobs, health care, food, and so on. If anyone *wants* something, we're happy to help out, but it does no one any good to buy them something as a hollow gesture; in fact, it's bad to do that because if they don't truly like it, they feel obligated to hang onto this piece of junk in case you ask them about it or want to see that they're using/displaying it.\n\nI definitely have the problem with my birthday, Christmas, etc., that everyone wants to buy me something. I. Don't. Want. Anything. If I'm pressed, I've started resorting to, \"Find me a nice bottle of rum.\" But my parents just said, \"We'll give you money and you can buy your own.\" You and I are definitely going against the current here. But it's ultimately worthwhile, I think.\n\n**Edit**: I'd also like to point out an observation I made about gifts and gift-giving being (at least to me) so unnecessary. Prior to my cross-country move last year, I gave away (to friends/family or to charity) loads and loads of crap that filled our house. I kept asking my parents if they wanted this or that, and at one point, they asked me why I was so readily jettisoning all this stuff. It was good stuff, they said. (\"Good\" meaning it still had lots of use left in it and/or still had some value; I could sell it if I wanted.)\n\nTo them, having grown up in a world in which you worked very hard for everything you have and you buy quality things that don't break, fixing them when they do ([http://reddit.com/r/frugal/](sound familiar?)), it seemed so crazy for me to be *willingly giving up* so much stuff. I had worked hard for these things, hadn't I?\n\nBut in fact, no, I really hadn't. The world has changed so drastically in the last 30-50 years that I can easily buy (or, for our wedding or birthdays since we were together, other people bought for us) so much stuff that we had **everything** we needed and way more than we could ever use. These possessions didn't represent our hard work; rather, they were mass-produced product of economies of scale.", "created_utc": "1367593910.0", "edited": "1367594527.0", "id": "c9roxrd", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_1dm9wi", "parent_id": "t3_1dm9wi", "score": "3", "subreddit": "Anticonsumption", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r83n"}, {"author": "because_its_there", "body": "Would you be able to get yourself a personal loan/line of credit from your bank or a local credit union?

Repeat step 2 until the answer is \"no,\" properly disposing of the contents of the laundry basket as it becomes full.\n\nOkay, so now you've gotten rid of everything you wanted to. (I suspect you're already at this point, though.) Great! Now, do it again, except this time, don't ask if each item is something you *want* to get rid of, but if it's something you *should* get rid of -- for whatever definition of \"should\" you choose. \"I really like this stuffed bear that so-and-so gave me, but it just sits on my desk taking up space, serving no purpose.\" I actually just did this with a box of my business cards that I *want* to keep because I'd like to think that I'll do something with them. But realistically, I haven't given many out in the last five years, so I'm not going to need them all. I threw them in the garbage about 20 minutes ago because they *should* go there.\n\nBy now, you should have (hopefully) made a good dent in your stuff. Still interested in going further? Ask yourself not whether you should get rid of this item, but \"Do I *need* this?\" You can take the term \"need\" loosely or you can be really extreme. Don't go extreme. Not now, anyway. You shouldn't be saying, \"Will my life as I know it end if I get rid of my French phrasebook?\" Instead, ask, \"Is keeping this book important to my goals for the next year?\" Maybe your goal is to learn French, so yes, you need that book. Don't throw it away.\n\nHaving moved across the country last year with my family of four, I can tell you that it is **hard** to get rid of stuff, but it is also very cathartic. Once you get rid of a few difficult items, you'll realize that it's a great relief to do so.\n\nYou also don't have to do it all at once. Go through and get rid of the things you *want* to today. Next week, get rid of the things you *should* get rid of. Or do it a little at a time. But be persistent, constantly pushing yourself to reassess what's important to you.\n\n**Edit:** I'll also note that you can iterate on the same question and still be very effective. Go through everything once, asking \"Do I want to get rid of this?\" And once you've done that for everything, repeat the same process with the same question. You'll find that as you realize that yes, you want to get rid of X and you want to get rid of Y but you didn't want to get rid of Z, the second time around, your feelings will change. The second or third go, you'll probably really want to get rid of Z.\n\nMy wife just told me a little while ago that before our cross-country move, when we purged stuff from our ~3000 sq ft house, she looked at a full storage room and said, \"There's really nothing to get rid of here.\" After we got rid of about half of it, she said, \"Wow, there was a lot of stuff to get rid of,\" which made the second iteration easier. Right now, I suspect you're in a position of, \"There's nothing here to get rid of.\" After a few rounds, you're going to look back and say, \"My god, there was so much clutter staring me in the face and I didn't even know it.\"", "created_utc": "1366594571.0", "edited": "1366598464.0", "id": "c9jz2v6", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_1ctw55", "parent_id": "t3_1ctw55", "score": "14", "subreddit": "minimalism", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r0z9"}, {"author": "because_its_there", "body": "My wife has been going to that gym for the last six months.

Find a non-professional that enjoys and is good at photography; pay them $200 (or whatever) for their afternoon/evening. Nowadays, everyone's got a decent DSLR, so you can get high-res digital photos. Have them print out and sign something professional-sounding that transfers the copyright to you. If you *really* want something printed out, you can do it almost anywhere. $1000+ saved.\n* Keep the guest list reasonable. We had 300+ people, most of whom were extended family. This is definitely a trade-off; a wedding is a celebration. My wife is very social and highly values family -- even extended family. So I wouldn't have been able to cut this back because she wanted so much of her extended family there. But her sister had probably half that many people, which really cuts back on costs.\n* Do your friends a favor. Don't have four groomsmen, four bridesmaids and two ushers. Every one of these people have to buy a dress/tux and put a lot of money into the event. (This principle applies to flower girls and ring-bearers as well.) If your friends aren't in a great place financially, this can be a bit of a burden on them, especially if they're travelling to get to your wedding. Groomsmen can double as ushers. Having too many means you're buying more gifts, having more space at the head table, and so on.\n\nAgain, keep in mind that a wedding is a (hopefully one-time) celebration. And the purpose of money should only ever be for enjoyment, immediate or deferred. Be frugal for your wedding, but don't be a cheapskate.\n\nAll said and done, we spent almost exactly $10k on our wedding.

Do yourself and your kids a favor and read this.

(It's time to eat dinner, and we do **not** have toys at the table. No, you had your chance to pick out a bedtime story, but you were screwing around. Get your jacket on, we are already late, let's move!) Someone told me a few years ago that while you should be consistent and set expectations of your kids, you also need to know when to be flexible and let things slide. **Your kids' childhoods should consist of mostly positive experiences.** Sometimes, I just need to stop criticizing how squirrely my kids are and play instead. (Some things are *not* flexible, though. You must look both ways when you cross the street. Period. It's not okay to push your brother off the top bunk bed. Ever.)\n\nI think if you [a] focus on an overall positive experience for your boys, [b] foster their creativity by letting them play outside and by encouraging them in unstructured play, you're 80% of the way there.\n\nA final, random (and possibly controversial) note: I know that many people are very much of the \"everything in moderation\" mentality, but we completely got rid of our TVs when we moved a few months ago. Previously, when we would turn the TV off, our boys would flip out. If the TV had been off and they wanted to watch it, it was an even chance of them running away to go do the next thing or flailing around on the floor in desperation. Now that we don't have one, they don't freak out about not watching it. That frees up a **ton** of time for them to read books, draw, play with Play-Doh, imaginary play alone or together, build a fort in the basement, or countless other things. I'm firmly in the camp of TV is very bad developmentally, not because it's bad in and of itself but because it's a time sink that detracts from much more beneficial stuff. (If you're going to let your kids watch TV, Mr. Rogers is, IMHO, the gold standard for proper developmental edutainment.

Also look into some very warm boots, mittens and a hat (i found [this](http://www.rei.com/product/761203/sherpa-adventure-gear-jumla-hat) to be ridiculously warm, even in -30F winter). \n* Mosquitoes in WA? I haven't seen a one. Seriously. In the four months I've been here, I've seen fruit flies and a pretty decent number of spiders, but no house flies, black flies, mosquitoes, or ticks. Expect plenty of those in MN. Maybe not so much of the black flies; I can't say they were a problem near St. Cloud, but I had friends up by Duluth (& BWCA) that talked about them a fair amount in the spring.\n* The land is much more flat in MN, overall, but Brainerd does have a good number of trees. My parents have a cabin not far from there, and it's nice looking out onto the lake and having a pretty dense forest all around. But I've never seen trees as big in MN as I've seen here in WA. If you get homesick for that kind of thing, I'm told the [Lost Forty (pdf)](http://www.fs.fed.us/r9/chippewa/camp/sitemaps/lostforty.pdf) is awesome, but I've never been there.\n* On that subject, there aren't mountains in MN. If you love the Cascades, you'll have nothing like that in MN. The closest I've found is something near Silver Bay or Finland (Mount *some female name* -- the name eludes me at the moment) within the BWCA. But we're talking *maybe* 2000'? I just did Mailbox Peak two months ago, and that's a hair shy of 5000'.\n* Minnesota has its own unique landmarks, like the mouth of the Mississippi, Gooseberry Falls, etc. There are some decent bike trails in the Cities; I don't know much about the trails near Brainerd, though. Which reminds me, if you're a bicyclist: be **extremely** cautious. There are occasionally bike/walking paths in parts of MN, but they're nothing like what exists in Seattle. If you were to try riding your bike on the road along with the cars, you'll get honked at at best; aggression at worst. Ride on the sidewalk if possible and on the shoulder when necessary.\n* [beanstalk mentioned](http://www.reddit.com/r/minnesota/comments/14fzk1/i_might_be_moving_to_minnesota_from_washington/c7cqx5r) the change in winter, but got downvoted for it. I actually agree. I grew up in MN. Spent nearly my whole life there. I remember getting plenty of snow. So much that my dad would very regularly clear the driveway with his tractor, stacking the snow into huge mounds that we would sled down or make igloos out of. We went snowmobiling most any day we wanted throughout the winter. And while yes, we would still get snowstorms and I would have to shovel or snowblow my driveway, it has not been as much precipitation as I remember getting. I will admit that memory is a fickle thing and that perspective changes, but I went to college in the UP of Michigan where they get **serious** snow. Snow in Minnesota is nothing compared to what the UP gets. People exaggerate how much snow MN gets, and the temperature is lower than most people think, IMHO. My lawn suffered following nearly every one of the seven years I had a house there becuase there was (almost) no snow cover to insulate the ground. I would probably see snowmobiles two or three times a winter lately.\n* You'll want a place with an air conditioner. Try to find a place with passive cooling, too, like trees and a white roof, if possible. I know people that are getting into ground source heat, which is great for cooling in the summer and heating in the winter. It's a bit of an investment, but very low maintenance costs (if done right).\n* A heavy rain in Seattle is a pretty light rain in MN. It doesn't happen very often, but when it does rain, it'll come down pretty good. Not the kind of thing you'll walk through: you'll go inside, stay in your car, or whatever. Minnesotans don't know the value of a rain jacket because they're of almost no use there.\n\n\nPeople\n\n* Politics in MN is interesting. The Twin Cities are generally pretty blue; rural MN is more red (a statement that probably holds true across the country). I hailed from Michelle Bachmann's district, so there were plenty of crazies. I know a few people near Brainerd that are quite conservative, but those few data points don't say much about that area as a whole.\n* The culture in MN is... lacking. At least compared to Seattle. That's not to say that there isn't anything to do, but you aren't going to have a half dozen sushi places in a few square blocks, nothing like Pike Place or EMP or the like.\n* Minnesota isn't as big on coffee as Washington is, either. If you like coffee, go find yourself a Caribou Coffee (there's one on 210 right off 25 in Brainerd, near Cub Foods?). Starbucks in MN isn't anything like Starbucks in WA.\n* The \"Minnesota Nice\" thing is a load of BS, IMHO. Don't get me wrong, Minnesotans are nice enough, but in my experience in MN, NM, MI and WA, they're no nicer, and when they're behind the wheel, they turn into real dicks. I was nearly run off the road a few times in MN while I was on foot, bicycle, motorcycle, and car. Washington drivers have been acutely aware of me in every situation and are even so nice as to refuse to pedestrians wait for drivers. MN drivers tend to gun it when the light turns yellow and pull all sorts of shenanigans like driving on the shoulder and cutting back in at the last second. (That was very true in St. Cloud; true to some extent around Rogers and Maple Grove. Maybe not so much in Brainerd?) Watch your back when you're on the road.\n\n\nEtc\n\n* The cost of living will of course be much lower. My mortgage outside St. Cloud was ~$1200/mo; rent here is ~$1700. In Brainerd, you'll probably be looking at sub-$1000 (depending on a number of factors). Groceries? Maybe not terribly different. Milk may be cheaper; meat certainly will be. I've been very happy with groceries from Target. \n* Dogs. Washingtonians, as you're no doubt aware, are very fond of them. Don't expect to see anywhere near as many dogs in MN. If you've got one, don't expect you'll be able to bring it into the grocery store, coffee shop, on the bus, etc., like people do in WA.\n* Football and baseball are pretty big in MN. Basketball and hockey a bit less. Granted, I've never been a sports guy, so maybe I just completely tune it out. No one cares about soccer like Seattleites care about the Sounders.\n\n\nThat's about all I can think of for now.", "created_utc": "1354905015.0", "edited": "1354905317.0", "id": "c7ctc68", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_14fzk1", "parent_id": "t3_14fzk1", "score": "6", "subreddit": "minnesota", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhxs"}, {"author": "because_its_there", "body": "See also their expansion sets for $10 each.", "created_utc": "1354864886.0", "edited": "False", "id": "c7cmi6r", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_14ebfm", "parent_id": "t1_c7cfa02", "score": "1", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i"}, {"author": "because_its_there", "body": "I own both the SingleNest and the DoubleNest.
