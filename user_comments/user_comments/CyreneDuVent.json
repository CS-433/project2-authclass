[{"author": "CyreneDuVent", "body": "Sightreading is a skill that takes practice like everything else, although some people do have an easier time with it than others. A good way to practice it is to start with pieces a bit easier than what you normally play - see if you can find some free ones online, buy a book or if your band is at a school ask if they have any practice versions. \n\nThat will help a lot with learning to read rhythms and see patterns. Another thing that can help is learning to simplify your music. When it first gets handed out, maybe you won't be able to play those sixteenth note or eighth note runs, but maybe you can play every other note, or every fourth note. You obviously want to learn the piece properly with practice, but that can be a good way to get the idea of a piece and be able to follow along with the rest of the band on the first couple run-throughs. \n\nAbove all, keep at it - you will get better at it over time.", "created_utc": "1666723351.0", "edited": "False", "id": "itr91zg", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_ydc58g", "parent_id": "t3_ydc58g", "score": "5", "subreddit": "Clarinet", "subreddit_id": "t5_2sc5o"}, {"author": "CyreneDuVent", "body": "agreed, I find cities don't tend to monitor these sorts of things and rely on reports to fix them.

Just to get the apple example out of the way, while planting apple seeds is an example of this true to seed or not question, grafting is mostly done to get shorter trees with hardier roots, not to grow the correct type of fruit.\n\nIn basic terms, if you have a plant which has been saved from seed and grown again for decades or centuries, and it is pollinated with the same variety of plant, the seeds that you get will always grow that same variety of plant, with the same characteristics - it grows true to seed. This is what people often mean by heirloom varieties - you've probably heard of heirloom tomatoes. Heirlooms are good because you can always save seed and grow again, (and a lot of people think they taste better) but they're often less resistant to disease, smaller, keep for less time or have other undesirable traits.\n\nBecause of this, we've developed hybrids - taking two distinct varieties of a plant and breeding them together. With a bit of luck or trial and error with what varieties to use, this can give us a plant with the best qualities of its two parent plants. This is called a hybrid advantage.\n\nThe issue with this is that those hybrid traits often aren't passed on the same into the seed. Mules, the hybrids or horses and donkeys, are infertile. While the genes of horses and donkeys are compatible enough to produce offspring, those genes get scrambled around in the donkeys and can't be passed on. Hybrid plants can work the same way, where the genes for large size or sweet taste get scrambled and don't get passed on to the seed, meaning that its offspring will be different - it does not grow true to seed.", "created_utc": "1664840726.0", "edited": "False", "id": "iqy97bp", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_xuylp4", "parent_id": "t3_xuylp4", "score": "2", "subreddit": "explainlikeimfive", "subreddit_id": "t5_2sokd"}, {"author": "CyreneDuVent", "body": "How hard is your water?

In this case, 1.867. Then, you multiply it by the power of ten that would give you that number - this is the number of places you had to move the decimal. In this case, you moved the decimal three places to the left - x10\\^3.\n\nTo give some examples of where this is useful, writing 0.0000000000782g requires counting zeroes, and leaves a lot of room for error.

Therefore, when birth rates go down and populations starts to shrink, it messes with our economies. \n\nOn a long term scale, it is a good thing that birth rates are decreasing. The earth cannot support its current population, and lower birth rates is the only non-tragic way to lower the population. However, it is a bad thing if we do not change our society to account for it. We will need more support for older people - the single family home has done a great deal of harm to at-home elder care. Additionally, vast swathes of the population have jobs which simply exist because of capitalism - people who get people to spend money for no real gain, simply because they need to make money to eat. With a smaller workforce, those people would need to be shifted to jobs which are actually necessary. \nFinally, combining the above points, grandparents and other older relatives have historically contributed to society in many ways like taking care of grandchildren.

This is why gluten free bread is crumbly, why bread dough stops sticking as you knead it, and why mixing doughs and batters too much can make them get tough and dry. \n\n2. Enrichment. The secret to making dough into pasta, brioche, fluffy rolls is enrichment. Adding eggs, scalded milk or butter can change the protein makeup of the dough, making it taste different, stick together different, and behave differently when it\u2019s cooked\n\n3. Leavening. How a dough is raised can completely change how it comes out of the oven. Yeast and baking powder don\u2019t tend to come out too differently other than taste as both rely on releasing carbon dioxide as they\u2019re mixed and heated to create little bubbles inside the bread.

The idea is that while you can control things like eye movement and basic nervous habits, you have to be completely calm, even on a subconscious level, in order to not register on a polygraph. \n\nHowever, people are normally a bit nervous when they\u2019re doing something that needs a polygraph, so it\u2019s important to establish a baseline. I\u2019ve never taken a polygraph, so you probably know more about this bit, but as far as I know they\u2019ll ask you some basic questions to start off, like your name, in order to see what your typical reaction is to being questioned. \n\nWhen they said they couldn\u2019t get a baseline, it could either be that they couldn\u2019t get a consistent result in those beginning questions, or, more likely, that something is happening during the questioning that\u2019s giving you false positives. It could be something like that moment that you think about your situation a bit more and realize that it determines whether you get a job, or just your subconscious screwing with you. \n\nIt\u2019s really unfortunate that this is keeping you from getting a job.
