They may talk early, learn to read early, and progress at the same level as normal children who are significantly older. Gifted students also tend to demonstrate high reasoning ability, creativity, curiosity, a large vocabulary, and an excellent memory. They can often master concepts with few repetitions. They may also be perfectionistic, and frequently question authority. Some have trouble relating to or communicating with their peers because of disparities in vocabulary size (especially in the early years), personality, interests, and motivation.

Really stellar job from Brandon McInnis in that whole inner monologue during the song.\n\nI agree that the line you mentioned was \u201csoftened\u201d too much\u2014 sometimes they have to change things because it doesn\u2019t match the mouth movements in English so I wonder if that\u2019s what happened, or if it was a deliberate choice. I also didn\u2019t like that they changed the line about \u201cmy dead boyfriend\u2019s guitar\u201d to \u201clate boyfriend\u201d instead\u2026 didn\u2019t have that same bluntness that smacks you in the face.\n\nI LOVED LOVED LOVED Haruki\u2019s VA! He really just nailed it. Everything he said sounded \u201creal\u201d to me.\n\nI was also impressed with J Michael Tatum as Ugetsu. I was skeptical at first because I\u2019ve only heard him in roles that were very different from this (Tenya Iida in MHA, Erwin in AOT, etc.) but his speech was so\u2026 delicate? Is that the word? With this air of sass and slight superiority like he\u2019s trying to act like he doesn\u2019t care, he\u2019s above it all\u2026 honestly I think he nailed it.\n\nIt was an excellent job by all. My two complaints are 1) the lack of on-screen translations for written Japanese and the FNH lyrics (which is a CR thing from my understanding), and 2) the audio mixing seemed a little off sometimes\u2026? Like I had trouble hearing and understanding them over the background music and sounds. And that\u2019s really minor and nitpicky, really.

Anyway if you have any questions, I\u2019ll try to answer them! I saw episode 1, and season 6 premieres on Saturday, October 1 \ud83e\udd70\n\nEpisode 1 was very fast-paced, but not in a bad way. It touched on ~~episodes~~ chapters 258, 259, 260, ~~and 261.~~ (edit: my mistake\u2014 my manga are back in the US so I was going off chapter summaries & misread something).\n\nAll the scheduled voice actors were there with the exception of Kaito Ishikawa (Iida). \n\nThe actors did some live readings of anime scenes, answered some questions, and then there were two pretty long dramas. My real-time translator app did not work in the arena so unfortunately I understood very little\u2026 the first drama was something about Mina, Uraraka, and Tsuyu looking for Volume 34 of a manga. They went around the dorms and asked a bunch of the other students whether they had it or had seen it or something. Since Iida was not there, his part was text based on the screen, almost like an otome game. It involved all the actors minus those in the second drama\u2014 and the second drama was Bakugo, Deku, Todoroki, Hawks, Endeavor, and Aizawa. Theirs was some sort of student rescue mission in an underground pipe/sewer, and the students were communicating via radio with the heroes above ground.\n\nIt was so awesome to see the voice actors performing live\u2026 they are incredibly talented!!\n\n* Tetsu Inada (Endeavor) had his hair, beard, and mustache dyed BRIGHT red \ud83d\ude02 I couldn\u2019t understand most of what he was saying, but he seemed like a really fun guy & was riffing with Todoroki a lot \ud83d\ude06\n\n* Daiki Yamashita (Deku) is just the happiest and most energetic guy\u2026 and he has big red sneakers just like Deku! He kept twirling back and forth in his chair when he was waiting for his turn to speak, haha\n\n* Nobuhiko Okamoto (Bakugo) had his hair dyed Bakugo-blonde, and he was AMAZING live. Seriously, the guy is mad impressive!! \n\n* I nerded out so intensely over hearing Yuichi Nakamura (Hawks) live because I am a massive JJK/Gojo fan as well\u2026 so that was a double treat to see him!!\n\n* Aoi Yuuki (Froppy) was super impressive with how she switches between Froppy and her regular speaking voice. She was also decked out from head to toe in green, which was adorable! Her live anime scene was from when Tsuyu confronts the Baku rescue squad, which is not an easy scene at all, and she nailed it!", "created_utc": "1658657454.0", "edited": "1658761157.0", "id": "ihfk50v", "is_submitter": "True", "link_id": "t3_w6s7og", "parent_id": "t3_w6s7og", "score": "35", "subreddit": "BokuNoHeroAcademia", "subreddit_id": "t5_34a0h"}, {"author": "PM_MAJESTIC_PICS", "body": "AFO specifically targeted Shiggy because of his connection to Nana/OFA, and he gave Shiggy the Decay quirk.

He\u2019s also so sweet and cute. I love the way he just snuggles into Ritsuka and like\u2026 absorbs his touch. His resilience in moving forward after the traumas he has experienced is really amazing. And again\u2026 he\u2019s so damn cute that it kills me a little bit. \n\n2.
