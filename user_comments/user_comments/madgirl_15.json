She had been listening to a lot of K-pop recently and wanted me to watch some songs from Monsta X, BTS, and others. I had only heard a few BTS songs and a couple of EXO songs I bumped into on YouTube and added to my Spotify. I\u2019m not really into K-pop and I don\u2019t really watch music videos.

I was definitely intrigued. \n\nBy now, I\u2019ve listened to their entire discography, although I do this with most of my favorite artists. What I don\u2019t do is see their videos on their YouTube channel, along with all their music videos, many concert performances, and dance practices. Even cried a little during [one video interview](https://youtu.be/NxryzznrhEw), which is very rare for me. I also think liking the same group as my best friends helps us share a bond via the stories, music, and videos we share. \n\nIn general, I\u2019m drawn to them because they\u2019re so unique. I\u2019m not sure if this is something common in K-pop but I see their genuine artistry via their songs and dances. They seem honest and real in interviews, even when they\u2019re silly. Their lyrics are relatable and their beats are so innovative. They\u2019re so confident on stage and very talented in dancing, rapping, singing, and composing.

If you are talking about farming world map and the stage has barricades, having an all Melee team (or even just 1 ranged and the rest melee) is not going to be great for killing zombies. For instance, I'd use that melee team for 7.1 but probably not for 13.3 that has obstacles. \n\nI would suggest keeping Annie as leader for her medium drop bonus (which is great) and Green Michonne too for the camo, but the rest should be ranged (or melees) with an AR that is good for zombies (I'd say drop Lester and/or Wilkins). \n\nFor instance, use Annie as leader, Michonne (green camo), 4* Rick, and two other characters with rushes that are good against zombies (critical bonus, headshot, stun, or even area attacks with like 300% damage are good for zombies). I don't know your rooster, so I can't make suggestions about how to replace Lester or Wilkins. But what I'm sensing is that the regular rushes that your melee characters have are good against humans but are limiting your zombie team. I'd really add in characters that have headshots as a rush.\n\nFor instance, my regular zombie team is much weaker, with Amy (4 star alert with small drop bonus and headshot rush), Timothy (3 star with headshot rush), Sandy (3 star with 220% damage to 3 enemies rush), Carl (4 star tough with stun rush) and the new 3 star alert Michonne with a rush that gives +35 crit and camo to 3 teammates (and she is only on tier 2). I put it on auto on 13.3, 12.1 or any other world map stage and don't die; don't even get a scratch. They all have their critical weapons with appropriate bonuses but I think those two headshot rushes really do help and I do have that green Michonne with camo but I opted to drop her in favor of that new alert Michonne. I sometimes saw green Michonne doing nothing other than being blocked by obstacles and the camo wasn't really helping that much since it was activating randomly and not when the team most needed it. \n\nAnyway, my point is that it perhaps depends on the stage you're going for and the difficulty (obstacles and such are bad for a mostly melee team) and the rushes of the characters you are using are limiting you. \n", "created_utc": "1469810511.0", "edited": "False", "id": "d5w2qv2", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_4v4pcc", "parent_id": "t3_4v4pcc", "score": "1", "subreddit": "TWDRoadToSurvival", "subreddit_id": "t5_39qiz"}, {"author": "madgirl_15", "body": "Thanks for the advice!
