News are short and organized so you mighr be able to see the way they construct sentence.\n\nThe word-count is important. For 53, you absolutely should be writing more than 200 words and for 54, you should write 600 words. They dock points if you don't meet the word-count. 53 is a bit tricky because you might go over the word-count if you write a lot but might not meet it if you're too short. You need to practice a lot.\n\n51 and 52 should be easy enough fot you. There are six kind of questions for 53. You should practice all of them because that's where you can get full marks. For 54, if they give you specific instruction, you should focus on that one thing. If they give you a broad subject, you might need to choose.\n\nYou should make sure you know all the \ub744\uc5b4\uc4f0\uae30 rules. Don't rely on native content for this because they can be wrong sometimes. Looking up videos or searching it in topik writing-specific textbooks would be better.
