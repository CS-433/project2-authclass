If you value campus life more than academics, you would probably enjoy UP more. If you value academics over campus life, Behrend is a great fit. Not to say there isn't fun things to do over here, because Behrend does have a lot of cultural people and Erie has fun things to do (I guess kayaking is a big deal up here). That's just my two cents.\n\nEDIT: You don't need to take Calc 3 or Physics (unless you want physics, I guess) at Behrend either!", "created_utc": "1615667463.0", "edited": "False", "id": "gqtyvc9", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_m4awqs", "parent_id": "t3_m4awqs", "score": "2", "subreddit": "PennStateUniversity", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rgmf"}, {"author": "Kelavandoril", "body": "I've seen two answers:\n1.
