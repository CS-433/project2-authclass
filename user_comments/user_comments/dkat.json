It can flip open all the way at the slightest opportunity to share or \u201crelease\u201d any of that pressure.\n\nI (and I assume most of us here) also seem to build up that pressure more easily than some\u2026\n\nThis could be frustrations during your day due to a struggle in emotional regulation or difficulties with navigating the world (thanks poor executive functioning skills). This could also be good things, like enthusiasm for a passion that you\u2019re really really hyper focused on right now or the tiniest piece of news for whatever subculture you\u2019re in (because apparently I think everyone and their brother wants to know that this year\u2019s Portland Trailblazers lineup is more balanced than ever lol).\n\nSo we have more pressure build up plus a poor way to regulate it. Solutions can help with either of those two things.\n\n\u2014 Medication, sleep, good diet, and exercise (healthy habits for everyone obviously, but definitely attention deficit folks) are a HUGE part of regulating the pressure build-up associated with everyday life. This is hard and frankly a lifelong struggle but helps so much.\n\n\u2014 Reducing alcohol (I\u2019ve got a pretty solid 2 drink limit for myself when I\u2019m out in social situations) is a big and pretty obvious one to help control that \u201cvalve\u201d \n\n\u2014 Active listening is important and has been the hardest for me to master. I am aware that I can be a less than ideal friend (not very responsive on text, talking more than listening). I\u2019m actively working on this one and agree with a lot of the comments about making this a hobby or habit. This is not a \u201cquick fix though\u201d.\n\n\u2014 Having a healthy place to release some of that pressure so it all doesn\u2019t come out at an inopportune moment is another piece of the solution. I was in therapy for a few months before my insurance changed and things got more expensive. I struggled to find the benefit and was often hoping for \u201cbig breakthroughs\u201d and a deepening understanding of self. But after leaving, I noticed that the opportunity to vent or share about issues, wins, struggles in my life was a BIG thing that helped me from over sharing. I\u2019ve found that diary entries and journalling are another really useful way to release some of that pressure \n\n\u2014 It fits a different category, but it\u2019s also important to note that some of the pressure from hyper-fixation is going to be harder to combat and will probably never go away. In this case, I\u2019m being gentle with myself and acknowledging that I\u2019ll always be a little bit of an over-sharer. I\u2019m finding that knowing particular people to get hyped about particular subjects helps. Yeah maybe some people won\u2019t get it, and I\u2019m a little weird. But that\u2019s me.\n \nTL;DR:\n\nWe are more prone to building up the pressure of things we\u2019d want to share and less able to carefully vent this pressure out. The obvious things can help with that buildup are the usual (medication, food, sleep, etc.) and working on our ability to manage that \u201cvalve\u201d is tough (habits around active listening, discipline around alcohol, etc.), but giving that \u201cvalve\u201d an easier time by venting in a safe space (therapy, journal) helps a lot!", "created_utc": "1660496665.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ik9v5mc", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_wo5lm1", "parent_id": "t3_wo5lm1", "score": "1", "subreddit": "ADHD", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qnwb"}, {"author": "dkat", "body": "Yes.

Item number\n2. Part description\n3. Technical specification number\n\nOur **item number** is a 7-digit number. We use a \u201cdumb\u201d number system for the first 5-digits (meaning that the next item created in MRP is just the next available 5-digit number) and use the last two as a sort of internal rev control. Ex. Item #####01 was utilized when we first made the part, but let\u2019s say we switched over from a manual to an auto-weld (a pretty significant production change), then we probably use Item #####02.\n\n**Part description** is anywhere from 1-6 words and matches the name on the technical drawing almost one for one. Usually this has location terms like \u201cFWD,\u201d \u201cAFT,\u201d \u201cLH,\u201d \u201cRH,\u201d as well as the platform the part is used on (\u201c737 MAX\u201d for example), and a pretty technical name (maybe \u201cEAI Supply Duct\u201d).\n\n**Technical specification number** (also drawing number or \u201cCustomer X-Ref) is entirely based on the technical drawings or specifications that define the part. This might be the external customer drawing number that we build and purchase the part under, but it could also be a different internal number (from another bucket of \u201cdumb\u201d numbers we use for drawings).\n\nI think the key for why things work *relatively* well at our facility is that there are multiple fields that define each unique part and people don\u2019t need to learn a new \u201csmart\u201d language. We sometimes get mixed up because our more customer-facing folks like to talk about parts via the technical/customer number and the manufacturing floor usually calls things by their internal number, but the three fields are all unique enough that we can see eye-to-eye.\n\n**TL;DR:**\nMRP systems should be able to accommodate more than one unique field and printing them all on a work order cover is a good way to go! Multiple fields means that the internal part number can be a \u201cdumb\u201d number and no one needs to learn a new language.\n\nAs an add-on, I\u2019m trying to get us another, freer, text field to include the more informal name that the shop floor has come up with over the years\u2026 Ex. Even though the technical drawing and part description is a \u201cFeeder Duct Assembly\u201d it\u2019s a lot more fun to call the part a \u201cBearclaw\u201d so that stuck more and no everyone from the newest operator on the floor to the head of engineering knows what part that refers to\u2026", "created_utc": "1658600201.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ihcmjvl", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_w65cfu", "parent_id": "t3_w65cfu", "score": "2", "subreddit": "engineering", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhpi"}, {"author": "dkat", "body": "1, 6, 5", "created_utc": "1658597527.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ihcgag4", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_w5pmua", "parent_id": "t3_w5pmua", "score": "1", "subreddit": "Sneakers", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qrtt"}, {"author": "dkat", "body": "Won a local raffle for the OFF-WHITE Blazers and managed to sleep through my alarm and miss my time slot for pickup entirely\u2026\n\n[Painful to this day.](https://ibb.co/SPctM84)", "created_utc": "1658571419.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ihb1iqe", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_w5j1k4", "parent_id": "t3_w5j1k4", "score": "2", "subreddit": "Sneakers", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qrtt"}, {"author": "dkat", "body": "I think you cracked it\u2026 Andrew is so good in my eyes because he really sells that he\u2019s having a good time with it.\n\nI love the Rami films, but Tobey always felt stiff to me.
