After reading this comment, you should do some further reading from books to understand more about the history.  \n\nThe people who identify as Assyrian/Chaldean/Syriac/Aramean are in fact ethnically the same people. They call themselves Suraye/Suroye/Suryoye (\u0723\u0718\u072a\u0308\u071d\u0710) in their language which they call Sureth/Sureyt (\u0723\u0718\u072a\u071d\u072c). For the sake of using one term, I will use the term Assyrian to denote ethnicity as it is the most mutually agreed on term and has the most historic/factual backing. For the language I will call it Assyrian Aramaic as it is indeed Aramaic but distinct to other Aramaic dialects.  \n\n>How they differ ethnically and linguistically from each other?\n\nAssyrians are split between two linguistic groups: East and West Assyrians. Within each group there are different dialects, but for the most part the main difference in linguistics is between these two groups. E.g. an Eastern Assyrian would say \"Shlama\" for peace, and a Western Assyrian would say \"Shlomo\". \n\n>Which people belong to which church?\n\nReligiously, Assyrians are very diverse. They are split between the Syriac Orthodox Church, Syriac Catholic Church, Chaldean Catholic Church and the Church of the East. Generally speaking, Eastern Assyrians either belong to the Chaldean Catholic Church, or the Church of the East. Western Assyrians typically belong to the Syriac Orthodox and Syriac Catholic Churches. But there are many that are in fact Eastern Assyrian when their church is predominantly Western Assyrian. \n\n>How they historically formed into distinct groups? (If they happen to have common roots)\n\nThe Eastern/Western Assyrian difference was due to each group living on respective sides of the border between the Romans and Sassanid Persians. These groups were effectively separated from each other and then formed their own dialects. \n\nOver time, theological splits occurred in the Church which formed different groups. Since back then groups formed themselves in their religious groups, they started to distance themselves from Assyrians that belonged to other denominations, even though they remained the same people. \n\n**NOTE:**\n\nNow terms like Nestorian are actually derogatory terms used to associate Assyrians belonging to the Church of the East with Nestorius who was labelled a heretic at the Council of Ephesus in 431 AD. Similarly, terms like Jacobite have also been used in a derogatory sense to refer to Assyrians belonging to the now Syriac Orthodox Church. That's why terms like Nestorian/Jacobite/Chaldean should not be used to describe Assyrians. \n\nMandeans are not the same people as the Assyrians I described above. They are their own ethno-religious group but have their own religion and dialect of Aramaic that they once spoke called Mandaic.

When Mar Eshai Shimun was exiled from Iraq, he switched the calendar of the Church from the Old (Julian) Calendar, to the New (Gregorian) Calendar, in line with customs in the West. According to his brother, Teodoros d'Mar Shimun, it was because Mar Yosip complained to Mar Eshai that Muslims were making fun of Nestorians for celebrating Easter and Christmas on a separate occasion to Catholics. \n\nThere were five points that could not be agreed upon, which ultimately led to unification talks halting.

In the region around Amid (the modern-day city of Diyarbakir, Turkey), people would go out to collect flowers and herbs, placing them in a large bowl of water, so as to completely cover its surface. A valuable item would then be dropped into the bowl and the members of the household would then try to retrieve it, with whoever is successful in doing so being considered lucky and blessed for the remainder of the year.  \n>  \n>Furthermore, every year on April 1st, natives of the city of Mosul would display wheat and bulgur (cracked wheat) in small plates at the front doors of their homes, as well as seven kinds of seeds and nuts in front of their houses. They would also display a bundle of flowers, in echo of the \u201cApril\u2019s beard\u201d (Diqna d-Nisan) tradition practised in the villages of the Hakkari highlands. Inside their homes, they would adorn their dinner tables with seven types of fruit (especially apples and pomegranates, but also peaches, pears, plums, apricots, quinces or figs), seven types of seeds and nuts (such as pistachios, cashews, walnuts, almonds, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and chickpeas), and also flowers.

Additionally, if one considers that the pejorative term 'Nestorian', applied polemically to the East Syrians for the first time at the so-called 'Robber Synod' in Ephesus in 449, implies the accusation that Nestorius spoke of two sons of God and thus fourfold divinity, one reaches the conclusion that Nestorius himself was no Nestorian!

The reason why we saw so much anti-Christian sentiment is because Armenians, as well as Assyrians and Greeks were grouped with the Western nations who were seen as \"Christians\".\n\nHowever, the context of the genocide was preventing Armenians, as well as Assyrians and Greeks from attaining any national objectives of their own. Anti-Christian sentiment was later spread to the laypeople of the Ottoman Empire to fuel their plan to eradicate these minorities.\n\n>Some people will argue that the Assyrian genocide was a separate but related event that started when the Ottomans attacked Urmia and Hakkari in 1914, but there is a problem with that. The only way to say that the Assyrian genocide was a separate event is by calling it the Eastern Assyrian genocide, because Armenians and Western Assyrians were massacred at the exact same time in the same places (because they lived in the same places, and all Christians were attacked). The Ottomans never treated us as a single Assyrian nation (and neither did we treat ourselves as such), so to argue that the Assyrian and Armenian genocide as a whole are separate is very inaccurate. Also, of course there would be no Armenian genocide in Hakkari and Urmia because Armenians were the minority there. The Ottomans (and especially the local Kurdish tribes) were attacking all Christians, and whether it was Assyrian or Armenian Christians who dominated whatever region didn't matter in the end.\n\nEven Armenians were murdered at different times with both the massacres against the Armenians in Turkey and in the Caucasus occurring at different times. So you can't use that argument to say the Assyrian genocide could be split in two.\n\nThe context of the Assyrian and Armenian genocides shared the same perpetrator and similar context.
