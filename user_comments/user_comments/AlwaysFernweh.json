In my own personal experience, I feel like native Spanish speakers are still proud of their language and use it quite often, which I admire. A long time ago I started learning Norwegian. I was super excited about, excited to learn and speak it with natives, but then I had quite a few Norwegians tell me they prefer English and most of them just speak it instead. It was kind of demoralizing. Obviously they don\u2019t speak for the entire country, but I feel like it\u2019s just not used as much, not to mention language exchanges are pretty one-sided. They already speak English as well as a native usually. Again, I\u2019m generalizing and forgive me for sounding ignorant.\n\nAccents are another thing I\u2019ve noticed too. Those learning English or have learned it as their L2, try really hard to lose their native accent. Personally, I love hearing someone from South America speak English with their accent, and same goes for Indians as well. I feel like losing their accent is losing a piece of their culture.

Next I\u2019ll figure out what race I think would best apply. \n\nThen I think of what kind of armor/robes I want him to wear, and figure out how to obtain those, and if I want to obtain them early on, or wait til later. Same with weapons and such\n\nAfter that I\u2019ll generally think of what quests would fit for the character. I write this all down in the notes app in my phone and pretty much go from there and make small changes as I\u2019m playing.\n\nMost important is the roleplay aspect.
