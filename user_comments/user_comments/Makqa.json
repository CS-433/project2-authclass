And also depends on how you are planning to play it. Do you expect to actually enjoy it? \n\nI would say, if you take a random AAA game where there is a decent amount of dialogue and text (skyrim, the last of us, dishonored, uncharted and such) the minimum would be B1 if you want to really just get the gist of a message and are not planning to stop and look in dictionary every time you come across a new word. But the question then would be, what exactly are you learning? Because then you would  be simply ignoring a large portion of text that you don't understand. And since you wouldn't want to parse it all (otherwise you would be moving through it very slowly and eventually get exhausted not enjoying the process) there would be little benefit learning-wise. \n\nBesides, you definitely don't know all the grammar at this level, so you, again, would be skipping a lot, and it would be much more difficult to pick up grammar rules on the go. So your choice is either ignoring a good 40-60% of the input and just playing the game, or trying to comprehend everything and not really enjoying the game as such. \n\nAnd let me tell you that you are going to see just as many complicated aspects of the language mixed along with the simpler rules that you would have learnt up to b1. To us, language learners, rules and words, register and in general the \"kind\" of language used, are graded and we tend to deduce the scarcity or frequency of a given nuance based on this level scale. \nNatives, however, for whom the product, such as a video game, is designed/interpreted, would by default not distinguish between the difficulty or complexity of a certain utterance. For them, unless they are specifically analysing it, it would be the same\"language flow\" and they can perceive with the same ease the more difficult, and rarer, (C2) nuances along with the simple (B1)aspects of the language that you have already learned (and not even mastered). So, in my view,  you will be out of your depth most of the time. \n\nI played skyrim in English a long time ago(2013-2014) , when I was somewhere around B1, I can say it wasn't the easiest experience I didn't know words like \"miscellaneous\". \"Conjuration\" and \"restoration\" were weird to me as well, you know. Then many years later I played it again after having learnt \ud83c\uddeb\ud83c\uddf7 to B1. And yes, I could get by (not lastly because of the fact that skyrim allows you to play dialogue lines many times over), but just couldn't quite immerse myself fully in the world as the language barrier was still quite tangible. Reading one book would take me a long time and I would have to double check if I understood some lines correctly. \n\nThen when I got my French to C1 I played dishonored and  did quite well, but still every now and then there would be words I didn't fully understand. Sometimes there would be some area-specific vocabulary and very colloquial language, swear words etc. Admittedly, though, Dishonored is more difficult in terms of language, at least in my view. \n\n\nI play horizon zero dawn now in German . And with C2 everything is really smooth, I do come across a few new words once in a while, but they stick much easier and sometimes I can even skip translating them because their meaning is deductible. I feel like I do derive great value for my German playing it, since it exposes me to new contexts and scenarios in which the language plays out. You will consolidate grammar, vocabulary and also fill in the remaining gaps in your knowledge, therefore at advanced levels video games really come in handy\n\nSo, learning a language through videogames, in my opinion, is a nice romantic idea. But it's potential for proper learning opens up towards C1 and higher when you already know most of the language. They are great for enriching your vocab and revising everything because of all sorts numerous contexts and situations they put you in\n\nMeanwhile,  I think playing at lower than B1 would be a torture for most games", "created_utc": "1660569311.0", "edited": "1660569612.0", "id": "ikdndy8", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_wovffz", "parent_id": "t3_wovffz", "score": "1", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "Makqa", "body": "I'm sorry to break it to Zelensky, but this war is by far not the biggest conflict over the last two hundred years.

Then, why no one is talking about Germany, Italy, Japan, the US and a bunch of other countries? \n\nJust recently China has literally killed millions of people due to corona virus around the globe.

It must definitely be much easier in liberal democratic regimes then it is in Russia, so why won't just go and do it?

I guess you could only properly have a peace of mind when you are C2+ . Also... ask yourself if you really understand everything that you hear in this language very well, because \"clear\" listening is a good indicator of your ability to \"process\" the language.

Even though reaching native-like proficiency seems like an impossible task, I personally get to surround myself sooo much with English media on an everyday basis that I could even go so far as to say that English is my default language at this point. And the thing about English is that once you can consistently understand it in listening and reading at some level it will be very easy to continue to develop your overal proficiency to the incredibly high level. It literally just clings to you: there are news, games, books, articles, mfs arguing with each other, etc. And there are so many studying resources available. \n\nConversely, it would be more difficult to do the same thing with German and French and other languages, because you need to specifically look for content and it doesn't pop up as naturally as English does. So, yes, although, English is not my native language and it took a while to learn it, I think I've still easily made up for that over time that at this point my english proficiency is sometimes barely distinguishable from my native language. \n\nMeanwhile, learning Russian to the same level would be much more difficult.

On average I understand around 70-80% of what I hear or see.\n\nYesterday I read an article about some military stuff which was in Ukrainian, again, I understood most of it except for a few words. \n\nSo to answer your question if Russian is going to be of help. Definitely, yes. By the time you learn Russian you\u2019ll have acquired a massive entry to Ukrainian and will be able to branch out into it a bit further no problem if you wish to do so. \n\nFirst of all, Russian and Ukrainian vocabulary are very similar. Admittedly, Ukrainian has its own words here and there but if you know Russian, those will be easily learnable because they will always ring a bell with the russian ones in terms of associations that you\u2019ve built through learning Russian. In terms of grammar, it\u2019s structurally the same, it\u2019s just that some concrete letters that denote a certain tense or grammar structure may change. \n\nFor example: \u00ab\u043f\u043e\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u043b\u00bb(understood) is going to be \u00ab\u0432\u0440\u0430\u0437\u0443\u043c\u0438\u0432\u00bb in Ukrainian. The grammar change is in the last letters, but even they are easily deductible when you have already internalised the pace, rhythm and paradigmatics and syntagmatics of Russian - everything still sounds more or less the same.\n\nI\u2019d say it\u2019s worth learning russian first and then if you are really keen on Ukrainian, you could very quickly mug up on the main grammar differences that manifest itself in Ukrainian, as well as learn a few hundred  most common words in Ukrainian that are different from Russian ones. Again, that wouldn\u2019t be the same as learning another language since you would only need to spend a few hours learning the differences.

( Les parties sont fusionn\u00e9es). So I am wondering where your C2 comes from. But even if you do have C2 I wholeheartedly congratulate you, achieving C2 is nothing short of remarkable. \n\nAnyway, the point of this argument was initially not who speaks more languages, but where the \u201efun\u201c part starts in languages.  But since you asked, I can tell you my french is already C2, I say it 100% certainty because in May I sat the official exam and failed only by 9.5 points. After having studied for around a year and a half. I got 40.5/100 where as you need 50/100 to pass. Since May i\u2018ve been studying french extensively and am 100% sure I\u2018ve already covered this 9.5 difference.  And I\u2018m taking the C2 exam again in December to confirm it. \n\nNow that aside, regarding the post itself. The OP clearly asks when the grind part stops and where the enjoyable part begins. \nListen, if you\u2018ve been studying some languages through A1 to C, which as far as I can see by your flair you have, you should be familiar with what language ability looks like at each level. A1, A2 and B1 are by ANY DEFINITION nowhere near the point where you can easily immerse yourself in native content and have no difficulty. Even at B1 your ability is still very limited - you only can communicate in a simple way about basic things and interests. \n\nOk, by your logic what would any fun activity be when you are, say, A2 like the OP assumes to be? Counting to ten on fingers? Talking about the weather? Listening to two friends talking about their day in school? Writing post cards? Reading post cards? Probably not. And then if not, you need to face the fact that until you reach C1 or even better C2, you will still not be able to enjoy the language IN THE WAYS THAT YOU INITIALLY IMAGINED when you set out to learn this language ( which includes music, films, video games, books, meaningful conversations etc. ) So now you have the tough reality where you have to grind through B1 and B2 where you have to learn a shit load of words and grammar...\n\nAnd then finally getting close to C1 you\u2018ll start to see the light at the end of the tunnel. Don\u2019t get me wrong: getting from c1 to c2 also requires learning a lot of words and stuff, but the most defining chunk of the language is already past you and you can enjoy it.\n\nOk, you can\u2019t see what\u2019s it\u2019s like to read \u201ele rouge et le noir\u201c while you are b1. Go and find something else \u201efun\u201c to do in Japanese. B1 in Japanese is decent but the best you can do is listen to simple songs still missing many things at times or read occasional comments on YouTube.  It also seems you\u2018re new to Chinese so go and try to do something fun in Chinese then. \n\nAgain, it doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t enjoy the process of learning itself, but the OP asks for an answer to the question: \u201ewhen does learning a language become more like a pleasant walk in the park rather than slogging your ass off mining coal\u201c. The answer is C1 or at least a solid B2, but, then...  when you reach C2 once in any language  you\u2018ll realise that anything lower is a joke.", "created_utc": "1633625339.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hfqxlmi", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_q2qubq", "parent_id": "t1_hfqlh89", "score": "3", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "Makqa", "body": "Yeah, looks like a rifle, exactly what \u5200 is, right?", "created_utc": "1633617309.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hfqe8pf", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_q2zf8e", "parent_id": "t1_hfonosq", "score": "8", "subreddit": "LearnJapanese", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qyls"}, {"author": "Makqa", "body": "I\u2018ve passed C2 in German so I can help.

The lyrics of these songs are charged with metaphorical sense and advanced vocabulary, you just wouldn\u2019t understand it if you had a lower level.  \n\nSpeaking of literature, try reading \u201eLe Rouge er le Noir\u201c in the original being anywhere lower than a solid C1, that wouldn\u2019t be fun at all. So you see my point.)\n\nSo if people have fun each in their own way at A2, so be it.

Well, may depend on the movie, but generally at least C1 and even then you\u2019ll have to read subtitles a lot and \nlook up new vocabulary.\n\nPlaying videogames? Again depends on the game, but no one is going to make a game easier to understand for language-learners. At c1 in french I used to play \u201edishonoured\u201c and there were many words I didn\u2019t know. Honestly, sometimes I felt like there were too many. \n\nWatching anime? Good luck doing that at b1 or even b2, especially in Japanese or Chinese where the non-knowledge of a character translates into a bigger lack of understanding than not knowing a word, say, in German.
