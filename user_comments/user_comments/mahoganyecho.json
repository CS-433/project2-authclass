oil in a pot, spices into the oil, wait for a bit, daal and water (anywhere between 3 to 2 parts water to 1 part daal) into the pot, mix, cover with lid, and then wait until it's done (this will depend on what kind of daal you have, you can google this). it's not a quick meal to cook on short notice but i recommend meal prepping a large batch and keeping it in your fridge. if well refrigerated (or frozen if that's your style) it's good to eat for about 5-6 days after you prepare it. khitchdi is the same thing except about 20 minutes before your daal is done you add in rice (and water) and it basically all gets cooked together so when you want to eat it you just have to heat it up.\n\nif you have an oven, i also recommend bread pizza or just regular pizza. prep time is pretty short. frozen dumplings are also good. you can pan fry them it takes no prep and they last pretty long in the freezer. pasta is also good. you can basically alter it to your tastes and preferences for

non-idol professionals", "created_utc": "1660218778.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ijugoq8", "is_submitter": "True", "link_id": "t3_wlk64s", "parent_id": "t1_ijudw6i", "score": "13", "subreddit":

that people who release music and perform at concerts and go on tours are not singers/rappers. if they really didn't have to entertain anyone with singing or dancing, they wouldn't be doing any of that. and with the amount of focus there is in the kpop industry on choreography and dancing well it's quite literally a part of their job too.\n\ntheir job to entertain isn't be *exclusively* about singing and dancing. they need more skills than that like being good in variety shows and honestly just winning the genetic lottery/getting plastic surgery and having pretty extreme diet and exercise regimens when it comes to looks. but that doesn't mean they aren't singers and dancers. you wouldn't give this kind of justification for literally any other type of professional who just doesn't do a huge part of their job well. no office worker gets a pass on being bad at giving presentations because \"i'm in sales i'm not a public speaker\"\n\n>Maintaining a low weight, youthful appearance and being perceived as beautiful, hardworking, and a good and engaging person are valued as higher than performance skills in Kpop. \n\nyeah? and we as the fans are the ones putting value to these things. i think it's a shame that this is a *music* industry where being good at singing/rapping isn't even within the top 5 things you need to be able to do. and don't get it twisted, this is 100% because of the fan culture. even western artists who aren't vocally outstanding can still carry a tune which is quite literally the bare minimum in terms of vocal technique and this is weirdly not true for kpop idols.\n\n>Most stan for visuals and personality first, company second, songs third, and skills last.\n\nmaybe we just run in different circles but i've never met someone for whom this is actually true. and like honestly if this is true i don't get all the hyping and defense of their skills. in this case literally no one should care if so and so is a good singer or not. and yet fans argue about

trying to sell/just 10 minutes a day on \\[name of latest app\\] will make you fluent! i know on this sub we generally agree that's not how it works but if you talk to a rando off the street they

you're some kind of language genius. all my friends without experience learning a language have given me the \"wow you're a genius\" thing for just getting to a rudimentary level in any foreign

insanely easy or insanely hard. plenty of \"you've been learning for a year but you aren't even fluent yet? did you even try?\" (upon further questioning this person considered being able to watch and understand 100% of a movie or tv show without subtitles, translation, etc fluency and was genuinely shocked when i said there's absolutely no way i could handle taking college level classes in korean). and also plenty of \"wow, you've been learning for a year and you can already talk to people? you must be a genius. i'm just not that talented at language learning i could never do something

*acceptable* and *this is just how people act when they're in love* when in the movie kabir stalks and harasses preeti until she seemingly \"falls in love with him\". there are men who *already* think like this and this movie normalizes this kind of thinking. rather than portraying a healthy relationship that they can strive for or an unhealthy relationship to stay away from, this movie shows an extremely unhealthy and abusive relationship to be love.\n\nthe difference with a hero that kills and beats people up is that the people who genuinely think that going around beating people up or committing murder in real life is something that makes you cool and looked up to rather than a deranged criminal are very few and far between. *this hero is also portrayed as only beating up bad guys.* this kind of black and white moral situation doesn't exist in real life, but these heroes still beat up goons instead of harassing innocent women that they just happen to think are pretty. this also doesn't mean that every single hero can or should or needs to beat people up - there *should* be a lot of depictions of male heroes who are heroic in ways that don't require any violence at all - doctors saving lives or lawyers fighting injustices. heroes who can actually exist in real life who are not just fiction.\n\nart imitates life, but life also imitates art. fictional depictions aren't just fiction - people really do take this stuff to heart and so while fictional depictions don't always have to promote moral good, the fact remains that kabir singh and any similar depictions of abusive relationships aren't made in a vaccum. they're made in a country where domestic violence and harassment of women has been and remains a huge issue. showing an abusive relationship as cute and

supposed to incorporate lentils and vegetables and fruit basically on a rotational basis so you don't eat the same thing multiple days in a row which means you'll have a varied diet and get all your micronutrients. ops dissatisfaction with his specific diet is unfair and borderline racist towards an entire subcontinent of people and modern western food isn't even necessarily more balanced than

trainees (and former idols and trainees) that they have insane conditions enforced on them by the company. stuff like literally starving you if the staff thinks you're getting too fat (which according

pick up a new skill like dancing or singing faster than a 22 year old. but that small advantage is not worth forcing said 12 year old into a system where their phone is taken away and their diet is carefully monitored to be the absolute bare minimum for them to not collapse on and every adult in their immediate vicinity is concerned about their looks and how marketable they are, not in

because peer review is ineffective but because what we see when professional dancers or choreographers who've worked with these idols before talk about their skills publically, they're only talking about their strengths. it's not really a bias or public relations thing (in my opinion), it's more of the fact that actual critique on an idol's weaknesses in technique are not going to show up on a public platform - they're going to stay in the dance studio.\n\ni think this actually leads to a rather skewed view of an idol's skill by fans who don't know how to judge things like technique just by watching a performance (which i would say is the vast majority of fans). when you already think an idol is basically a perfect dancer and then hear more praise about them, and have absolutely no idea

non-dancers. \n\ni don't know who should win out of jyp and sm for this but i don't really think either of them are really adequate. i think both companies have debuted idols who were lacking in dance skills at debut and continue to be lacking after years of being active as idols. someone like dahyun or yeri manage to do their own choreography ok to not necessarily stand out when watching the group but it's not like they have good technical foundations - they copy the shape of choreography and perform it mechanically. this isn't a bad thing for a beginner (if anything, it's how every beginner gets started and is a normal part of the growth process), but i would hope for something more than beginner level from people who have been dancing for 10 and 11 years respectively as their profession.\n\nmina and winwin both suffer with \"classically trained dancer who didn't relearn the technique required for idol choreography\" syndrome. i think it's clearer with winwin but both of them are in the dance lines for their respective groups and regularly miss footwork, miss details, are either unable to perform isolations or do them incorrectly, are unable to project power, etc. considering they've both been active for a few years now and both come from dance backgrounds i think it's a shame that no one at their respective companies thought it would be a good idea to provide them with the kind of dance training they would need to fix these issues.\n\ni guess my point here is that neither of them are particularly spectacular as dance companies. sm's vocalists genuinely *are* above average industry wide, even their lead and sub vocalists. aespa's karina and giselle are sub vocalists and are easily on par with some main vocalists i don't think either of them have this kind of track record with dancing. sm does tend to have standout main dancers and jyp does tend to have better overall group cohesion but it doesn't actually seem to translate into better overall

that i watched. i think the two of them combined take up half the song lmao).\n\ni don't think it's reasonable to compare them to dream at all though. saying this as a dreamzen who ults them. dream is a very uniquely cohesive group. they're the only group for whom i can genuinely say that no one ever feels like they're lagging behind regardless of their individual skill level, not even for a few seconds in a single performance. and not on variety shows or behind the scenes content. even though jisung has the fewest lines in dream, it never feels like he's being overshadowed while listening to their music. even though chenle is a weak dancer compared to the other members, it never feels like he's being overshadowed in their performances.\n\n127 isn't like this because MOST groups aren't like this. 127 isn't well balanced because this kind of balance is hard to find. i don't think 127 being off balance is that big of an issue. i did initially think it was very markyong centric but upon delving further into their discography, i think it's actually doyoung and taeil who get the most lines. 127 has more of the each person has a different but important role to play kind of equation than the each person shines equally thing that dream has going on. taeyong does tend to draw attention during dance performances with his powerful movements and intensity but that's what gives 127's dance performances their unique vibe. mark and taeyong own the rapping in 127 but that's because no one else in 127 can really deliver those lines in the same way that'll have the right vibe. they are a little overwhelmed with vocalists (imo) but each vocalist has a unique voice that suits the parts they sing that again no one else can do. and when watching variety shows or other content it's very clear that the group as a whole simply would not be the same without one of the members. \n\n127 has no filler members. they have great music and perform really well together as a group. they're

actually considers myself a (casual) fan of aespa. i like their music quite a lot (i tend to like sm music) and i like their choreographies too (tend to like sm choreographies as well, especially like ever since exo debuted). for me this is basically my golden formula to get me into any given kpop group, at least to the point where i'll check out their stages and usually even their behind the scenes content or variety appearances of my own accord. so i actually have watched a lot of aespa's stages and i found them to have incredibly poor stage presence. i think it was actually the best during black mamba era and all of the members progressively look more and more bored/stressed/unhappy/etc to be on stage in each comeback.\n\ntalking about stage presence is very complicated because of a couple of reasons. for one, it's basically entirely subjective and whether someone is good or bad at it is determined through majority public opinion rather than analysis of technique (as can be done for dancing singing or rapping). for this reason, it's also something that is very hard to teach. but at it's simplest i can describe it as someone who looks comfortable on stage, who looks like they enjoy what they are doing, and who looks like they want to be performing, regardless of what kind of concept they're trying to portray. and it also is when someone is able to completely sell the audience on their on-stage persona. for an example, i would say jhope is my gold standard for stage presence in the kpop industry. he never performs without looking like he's having the absolute time of his life.\n\nthe issue with aespa getting criticized on their stage presence isn't that \"its just another excuse to hate on them\". stage presence has ALWAYS mattered in every kind of performing art because no one wants to watch someone with perfect dance technique if they look like they don't actually want to be on stage. it's that they are getting disproportionate *hate* for having poor stage presence. it's perfectly fine to criticize the group for something they lack. they are lacking even when compared to rookies who debuted after them like le sserafim or purple kiss etc who haven't had the live audiences either. it's something they need to work on. we can't pretend their stage presence isn't an issue but we also can't just keep blindly hating on them.\n\npersonally i think their stage presence needs a lot of work even apart from working on other skills but i think it would improve greatly if they start singing live more (i did think their voices sounded much better live in coachella compared to the pre recorded tracks they've been using so far on music shows). and i also think it will improve if they improve their dance skills. i don't think any of them are bad dancers at all but i think improving dance technique will lead to more comfort with the choreographies they have to perform which will lead to looking more comfortable on stage. especially for winter who kind of just looks like she's trying to focus on performing correctly and has the most blank face i've ever seen from an idol.", "created_utc": "1655475746.0", "edited": "False", "id":

back home and they freak out if i even suggest making a quick run to one of the convenience stores about 5-10 minutes away from my house when we're out of milk or if i just want some chips. so i wouldn't be able to get to any govt (free) hospitals (plus they have super long waitlists) and i'm still financially dependent on my parents so i wouldn't be able to get a doctor who i can meet online (public hospitals are not currently doing this) or get a job that i can use to pay for said doctor.\n\ni do think you're right that they're mad that i made important decisions myself. i just can't really see my way out right now because when i'm on my own i just kind of fall apart and i'm worried about that happening when i go back to the usa. and when i'm with my parents i have to deal with

as possible in the hope that it will help you understand how i personally make these decisions which will hopefully help you also decide.\n\ni have two languages that i speak natively (english and hindi), one heritage language i speak a bit (punjabi), one heritage language i don't speak at all (kangri), one language i've studied in school (french), one language i've self studied (korean). plus i have a list of languages i'm interested in studying in the future (very long and organized by priority, the prioritization changes a lot) and a lot of languages i've dabbled in in the past but never seriously studied.\n\ndeciding which ones to maintain is relatively simple for me. all my education is in english (i'm a college student) so english is on that list. hindi is my native language so it's also on that list. i speak punjabi with my grandparents so it's also on that list. french is not on this list because a while ago i decided i don't enjoy french and i don't want to put any more time and energy into it. i have no other languages that are at a high enough level to maintain (apart from korean, which i'm learning). i decide these based entirely on which ones i want + need to use everyday + which ones i want to have at a high level in the long run.\n\ndeciding which languages i want to actively learn is based on how much time i have + which ones i would like to learn in the near future (and to what levels) + what my current level is in these languages. currently, i'm doing korean (low-mid intermediate) and thai (complete beginner). \n\ni rank the languages i'm actively learning by priority (higher priority = more time) and then decide on which activities to do when studying based on how much time i have and what level i'm at. i do mostly input for learning in general, but do much more traditional studying at lower levels. if i don't have enough time to do both, i will do exclusively traditional study at the a0-a1 level and exclusively input at higher levels. i tend to give languages i'm better at higher priority (korean has higher priority than thai right now) because i want to get the languages i'm already better at to an even higher level so i can take it from \"learning\" status to \"maintaining\" status and focus on other languages. \n\ncurrently, i spend a good 95% of my time on korean, in which i do input with a lot of lookups. the time i spend on thai is me taking learning the writing system incredibly slowly - learning a letter a day, and most days i don't learn anything new at all and i just go over the ones i already know. i don't want to take my focus away from korean right now. once i learn the thai writing system, i will increase the time i spend on it somewhat but still prioritize korean until i feel like i can continue to learn while drastically decreasing the time i put into it. i've found this system with doing only two at the same time at most to be sustainable for me.", "created_utc": "1649544321.0",

content of the book. this is why people recommend harry potter - it's assumed you're already going to be familiar with harry potter. it increases your willingness to push through a book even if it's not comfortable to read and you don't understand it very well. it makes the book easier to understand because it's easier to place yourself in the correct part of a story you've already read than it is to keep up with a brand new story in a foreign language. \n\nthe point of reading translated books is to read something you've already read before. and (in my experience) nothing is translated so unnaturally that it would stand out to a native speaker. i've read plenty of russian literature in translation and there wasn't a single word that i thought was an odd choice.", "created_utc":
