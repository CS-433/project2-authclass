Because meat contains none of these plant phytonutrients, when nitrites are added to meat as preservatives and colorings, nitrosamines form in processed meat.**", "created_utc": "1657665875.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ifx2meq", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_vxiwug", "parent_id": "t1_ifx1ksm", "score": "-22", "subreddit": "worldnews", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13"}, {"author": "apocalypsedg", "body": "It's about eating plants (anti-cancer) vs animal products (carcinogenic) [Are Nitrates Pollutants or Nutrients?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7zTJ5LnO1E)", "created_utc": "1657665106.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ifx0stu", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_vxiwug", "parent_id": "t1_ifwgklr", "score": "-57", "subreddit": "worldnews", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13"}, {"author": "apocalypsedg", "body": "Steve Brunton https://www.youtube.com/c/Eigensteve\n\nHe's a real professor & his videos are incredible", "created_utc": "1657550772.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ifq7v7e", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_vwivvz", "parent_id": "t3_vwivvz", "score": "7", "subreddit": "ElectricalEngineering", "subreddit_id": "t5_2sey9"}, {"author": "apocalypsedg", "body": "This is what the best hedge fund in the world does with their flagship fund, renaissance technologies, but their models are undoubtedly highly advanced and you won't be able to copy them by yourself", "created_utc": "1657540175.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ifpmeof", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_vwf2v9", "parent_id": "t3_vwf2v9", "score": "2", "subreddit": "compsci", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhmr"}, {"author": "apocalypsedg", "body": "Well you're just wrong I think, see the last comment\n\nhttps://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=326232#top \n\nIt had already been added by 31/12/2010 as a small cap to VTI", "created_utc": "1657205760.0", "edited": "False", "id": "if7pqeb", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_vthng8", "parent_id": "t1_if7ol14", "score": "6", "subreddit": "Bogleheads", "subreddit_id": "t5_2shb7"}, {"author": "apocalypsedg", "body": "I would say they actually didn't miss out on TSLA at all, isn't it like the 6th largest holding in the index? and they got it going all the way up", "created_utc": "1657199569.0", "edited": "False", "id": "if7bndh", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_vthng8", "parent_id": "t3_vthng8", "score": "9", "subreddit": "Bogleheads", "subreddit_id": "t5_2shb7"}, {"author": "apocalypsedg", "body": "I would definitely do it.\n\nYou won't incur any capital gains tax because you made a loss, and the loss can be carried forward for when you eventually sell your VWCE\n\nit will be nice and simple to go all in VWCE, perfectly balanced according to market cap ratio, instead of having to allocate to S&P 500+US mid/small cap + EX-US + VWCE in the same ratio.\n\n> or if I should wait, dont want to time the market, and sell it with profit\n\ndon't wait, the biggest green days are unexpected and during bear markets.\n\nYou can DCA if you wish but I would just take the plunge if I were you, you would just be postponing the risk to when you are fully invested otherwise.", "created_utc": "1657191297.0", "edited": "False", "id": "if6x8li", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_vtesjj", "parent_id": "t3_vtesjj", "score": "-4", "subreddit": "EuropeFIRE", "subreddit_id": "t5_3ljid"}, {"author": "apocalypsedg", "body": "\"and they've not lived up to their goals\"\n\nthis is the fault of the electorate not giving them more votes, not their fault for lack of ambition/trying, no?", "created_utc": "1657037123.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ieygo1q", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_vrteai", "parent_id": "t1_iexglhx", "score": "1", "subreddit": "ireland", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhb9"}, {"author": "apocalypsedg", "body": "do you want even the andorras of the world to have their own nuclear arsenal? because that's all that this would accomplish, zero trust, stability and lots of nuclear proliferation", "created_utc": "1656925656.0", "edited": "False", "id": "iesrcvv", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_vqyt08", "parent_id": "t1_iesqxg0", "score": "21", "subreddit": "dataisbeautiful", "subreddit_id": "t5_2tk95"}, {"author": "apocalypsedg", "body": "Communicate you don't want to care for the dog for free. \n\nIf they repeat their behaviour of not letting the dog out for hours while expecting you to do it, report owner for animal abuse.

In particular, if you keep leucine intake high, you can shift athletes towards more fast twitch muscle because of its effect on mTOR growth signalling. That's an easy supplement to take on a plant based diet for those so inclined. However it's likely that they will also be increasing their cancer risk, intramuscular fat, and decrease longevity.

I was somehow more conscious of the sounds I needed to be making, more capable of recreating them accurately far sooner.\n\nIt had pros and cons for other sounds. For example another advantage I realized I had was that many English speakers don't understand the difference between a voiced and unvoiced consonant. Typically even intermediate Spanish students from a monolingual English background will still be voicing all their t's in Spanish for example, while I was quickly aware the t was unvoiced by contrasting the Spanish t sound with Dutch and English t's. (e.g. for those who don't know: if you were to voice the t strongly in the word English word \"tip\" it might sound almost like \"tsip\" to a Dutch speaker, meanwhile the Dutch word \"tip\" could sound like the English word \"dip\".)\n\nIt has disadvantages too, for example Dutch uses a gutteral/uvular trill for its r, while Spanish uses an alveolar trill for the erre. Despite years of dedicated practice I still occasionally mess up the erre especially between vowels. I frequently wonder whether the gutteral trill is fundamentally easier than the alveolar trill, or whether it's just because I'm not a native Spanish speaker.

They don't provide any substantial reasoning or proof as to how they came to this conclusion, but I think this is because they fail the 4 things required by the \"equivalent\" fund test, and so by their non-equivalence should be taxed as securities, as long as you avoid Unit Trusts (with \"trust\" in the long title like SPY or QQQ; check etfdb https://etfdb.com/screener/#structure=UIT)\n\nhttps://www.revenue.ie/en/tax-professionals/tdm/income-tax-capital-gains-tax-corporation-tax/part-27/27-04-01.pdf\n\n> 2.1 \u2018Equivalent funds [s.747B(2A)]\nAn \u2018equivalent\u2019 fund is one which is similar in all material respects to an Irish\nregulated fund, that is, the funds which are taxed under the \u2018gross roll-up regime\u2019.\nThese are:\na) A unit trust which is similar to an authorised unit trust scheme authorised\nunder the Unit Trusts Act 1990 (cross reference to paragraph (a) of the\ndefinition of \u2018investment undertaking\u2019 in s.739B for inclusion of domestic Unit\nTrusts in the gross roll-up regime),\nb) A fund authorised as a UCITS (cross reference to paragraph (b) of the definition\nof \u2018investment undertaking\u2019 in s.739B for inclusion of domestic UCITS in the\ngross roll-up regime),\nc) An investment company which is similar to a Part XIII company (cross reference\nto paragraph (c) of the definition of \u2018investment undertaking\u2019 in s.739B for\ninclusion of domestic Part XIII companies in the gross roll-up regime), and\nd) Certain undertakings for collective investment which are similar to investment limited partnerships (Prior to the FA 2013 ILPs were included within paragraph\n(d) of the definition of \u2018investment undertaking\u2019 in s.739B. Post FA 2013 ILPs\nare dealt with under s.739J for taxation of domestic ILPs and are not equivalent funds as they are not taxed as part of \u2018gross roll up\u2019).\n\n\nNow we can see a non Unit Trust US ETF is clearly not a \n\n(a) a Unit Trust, \n\n(b) a UCITS fund,\n\n(c) an investment undertaking similar to a part XII company (if you check the requirements, they'd have to register for it here in Ireland, and I doubt Vanguard would have done that for their US market,\n\nnor (d) similar to an investment limited partnerships, as these are regulated by the central bank of Ireland(https://www.arthurcox.com/knowledge/investment-limited-partnerships-in-ireland/), and again Vanguard US is hardly going to subject itself to a random EU jurisdiction.\n\n\nThus it passes with 4/4 correct.\n\nThen you have to deal with priips and mifid ii, which blocks EU brokers from marketing them to non professional investors (I'm a sad poor unemployed recent graduate, but if you are middle age/near retirement you might have enough money to apply for this status from the Irish regulated IBKR  subsidiary or another EU broker like Degiro).\n\nAlternatively, you can open a US broker that's not regulated in the EU that accepts Irish customers. I opened a tradestation US account for this (careful; not tradestation global). You have to look at where they're regulated for example at the bottom of https://www.tradestation-international.com/ you'll see \"TradeStation International Ltd is authorised and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) in the United Kingdom \" which is what we do not want.\n\nI might also open a tastyworks account to split the risk in case one stops offering the service. \n\nThese are the only two big trusted brokers that offer this that I'm familiar with. There's also firsttrade https://www.firstrade.com/content/en-us/international but I have no experience with them. AFAIK these are the only three, so there is a risk they set up EU subsidiaries and close US branch to EU customers like IBKR did. \n\nYou can follow the europoor guide on how to fund it, you'll have to use  currencyfair (accepted by both tradestation US and by tastyworks), it's a good website. https://europoor.com/\n\nedit: regarding the risk of all 3 closing, you can still transfer assets to EU broker I imagine, you aren't just going to lose them.", "created_utc": "1650022129.0", "edited": "1650022798.0", "id": "i4tim6l", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_u44s3m", "parent_id": "t3_u44s3m", "score": "7", "subreddit": "irishpersonalfinance", "subreddit_id": "t5_3icd1"}, {"author": "apocalypsedg", "body": "That's a shame, he actually wrote a few high effort analyses himself and the subreddit was turning into something interesting, but censoring new ideas or \"argumentative\" comments (let alone banning OP, the quality of your work speaks for itself) is a good way to destroy all reputation pretty quickly.", "created_utc": "1649323539.0", "edited": "False", "id": "i3qpmv9", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_ty7b4q", "parent_id": "t3_ty7b4q", "score": "7", "subreddit": "u_rao-blackwell-ized", "subreddit_id": "t5_cb1jv"}, {"author": "apocalypsedg", "body": "He doesn't care about consciousness nor sentience, he justifies it with the social contract argument and arbitrarily cares more about total human wellbeing than total wellbeing. \n\nIf he did, it would literally be an unfalsifiable position that doesn't even make sense, as the consciousnesses between animal species, including humans, definitely lie on a continuous spectrum (\"definitely\" as in the same probability that the sun will come up tomorrow or that other humans have consciousness too, yet less than that arithmetic logic is true. The difference is so irrelevant to me). We have DNA, brains and nervous systems, we are not fundamentally different categories of things like a machine is. Resting an argument on this being unfalsifiable, i.e. that consciousness doesn't come from nervous systems seems incredibly bad faith to me when it's the only thing that is reasonable  beyond a 0.00...01% doubt, we can just never eliminate it completely. Changes between species come about gradually, through evolution, and lie on a spectrum, and we all have a common ancestor. At what generation of ancestors would the other branches of our ancestry tree have lost the trait of consciousness if not? It just doesn't make sense.\n\n\nHe also radically misjudges what being vegan entails, he thinks it's some  big sacrifice, when it's literally a tablet (that's only necessary because chlorine in water supplies kills the natural b12 producing bacteria; which I don't complain about because it also eliminates diseases like typhoid, but some argue the necessity makes the diet unnatural). Yeah there is an adjustment period when changing a 3x/day habit you've had your entire life, but it's not long or difficult in the slightest. You can then just eat a balanced diet composed of things you should be eating anyway. It's super easy to find vegan food (actual plants, the desire for \"fake meat\" and other substitutes that recreate animal product tastes are things most vegans grow to dislike after a short adaptation period anyway when we realize how dumb cultural normalized nonveganism actually is) and it tastes good once you learn how to cook properly with unprocessed food, seasoned with herbs and spices, according to good recipes, etc. Modern hyperpalatable processed food and fat/protein/energy dense animal products can distort the sense of pleasure from taste we should be getting from natural foods until the resensitasation period is over. That is, quickly satisfying your daily energy requirements with an oily steak feels good in the same way chocolate protein bars feel good because of the \"hit\" of energy/fat/protein it provides not the actual taste. Disagree=wrong. There are similarly energy dense vegan foods, that can give you the same high protein/energy kick like a block of fried tofu/seitan/tempeh/mycoprotein. And if there really are certain things you can't do without no matter how niche there will be a vegan substitute for it, 99% guaranteed.

One Saturday evening, a TV program introduced a new method to lose weight. The method was simple: toast some dry, raw, white kidney beans in a frying pan for three minutes, grind the beans into a powder, and then dust it onto rice. Within days, a thousand people fell ill, some with such severe diarrhea and vomiting they ended up in the hospital. Why? Lectin poisoning. Three minutes of dry heat is not enough to destroy the toxic lectins in kidney beans. If you don\u2019t presoak them, you need to boil large kidney beans for a full hour to completely destroy all the lectins, though if you first soak them overnight 98 percent of the lectins are gone after boiling for just 15 minutes and all are gone by half an hour, as you can see at 0:44 in my video Are Lectins in Food Good or Bad for You?. And, indeed, when researchers tested the white beans, they found that toasting them for three minutes didn\u2019t do a thing. It\u2019s no wonder people got sick. But, 95 percent of the lectins were inactivated after boiling them for three minutes and completely inactivated after ten minutes of boiling. Evidently, \u201c\u2018Do not eat raw beans\u2019 is a traditional admonition in Japan to prevent intestinal problems\u201d\u2014and now we know why.  \n>  \n>While canning may completely eliminate lectins from most canned beans, some residual lectin activity may remain in canned kidney beans, though apparently not enough to result in toxicity. And, ironically, \u201cHow doses of lectins may be beneficial by stimulating gut function, limiting tumor growth, and ameliorating obesity.\u201d What? I thought lectins were toxic.  \n>  \n>For as long as people have speculated dietary lectins are harmful, others have conjectured that they may be protective. \u201cIf this theory is correct, appropriate lectins by mouth should be of use in the prophylaxis \\[prevention\\] (and possibly treatment) of colon cancer.\u201d Or, of course, we could just eat our beans.  \n>  \n>Interest in the purported antitumor effect of plant lectins started with the discovery in 1963 that lectins could distinguish between cancer cells and normal cells. Researchers at Massachusetts General Hospital found a substance in wheat germ\u2014the lectin in whole wheat\u2014that appeared to be \u201ctumor cell specific,\u201d clumping together the tumor cells, while the normal cells were left almost completely alone. In fact, it is so specific that you can take a stool sample from someone and, based on lectin binding to the colon lining cells that get sloughed off into the feces, effectively predict the presence of polyps and cancers.  \n>  \n>Subsequently, it was discovered that lectins couldn\u2019t only distinguish between the two types of cells, but also extinguish the cancer cells, while largely leaving the normal cells alone. For example, that same white kidney bean lectin, as you can see at 2:53 in my video, was found to almost completely suppress the growth of human head and neck cancer cells, liver cancer cells, breast cancer cells, and cervical cancer cells (at least most of the way), within about three days\u2014but that was in a petri dish. Those petri dish studies are largely the basis of the evidence for the antitumor activity of plant lectins. How do we even know dietary lectins are absorbed into our body?  \n>  \n>  \n>  \n>Colorectal cancer is one thing. The fact that lectins can kill off colon cancer cells in a petri dish may be applicable, since lectins we eat may come in direct contact with cancerous or precancerous cells in our colon, \u201cproviding a mechanism\u201d by which bean consumption may help in \u201cthe prevention and treatment of colorectal cancer.\u201d Even more exciting is the potential for effectively rehabilitating cancer cells. The \u201closs of differentiation and invasion are the histological hallmarks of malignant cells,\u201d meaning that when a normal cell transforms into a cancer cell, it tends to lose its specialized function. Breast cancer cells become less breast-like, and colon cancer cells become less colon-like. What these researchers showed\u2014for the first time\u2014is that the lectin in fava beans could take colon cancer cells and turn them back into looking more like normal cells. As you can see at 4:13 in my video, before exposure to the fava bean lectins, the cancer cells were growing in amorphous clumps. But, after exposure to the fava bean lectins for two weeks, those same cancer cells started to go back to growing glandular structures like normal colon issue. Therefore, dietary lectins or putting them in a pill \u201cmay slow the progression of colon cancer,\u201d potentially helping to explain why dietary consumption of beans, split peas, chickpeas, and lentils appears to reduce the risk of colorectal cancer based on 14 studies involving nearly two million participants. Okay, but what about cancers outside of the digestive tract?  \n>  \n>  \n>  \n>\u201cAlthough lectin containing foods,\u201d like beans and whole grains, \u201care frequently consumed cooked or otherwise processed, these treatments may not always inactivate the lectins\u2026For example, lectins have been detected in roasted peanuts\u2026.\u201d Peanuts are legumes, and we don\u2019t tend to eat them boiled but just roasted or even raw. Are we able to absorb the lectins into our system? Yes. As you can see at 5:12 in my video, within an hour of consumption of raw or roasted peanuts, you can detect the peanut lectin in the bloodstream of most people. Same with tomatoes. Some of the non-toxic lectin in tomatoes also makes it down into our gut and into our blood. Wheat germ agglutinin, the wheat lectin known as WGA, doesn\u2019t seem to make it into our bloodstream, though, even after apparently eating the equivalent amount of wheat germ in more than 80 slices of bread. And, if you ate something like pasta, the boiling in the cooking process might wipe out the lectin in the first place anyway.  \n>  \n>  \n>  \n>In terms of phytochemicals in the fight against cancer, lectins are able to \u201cresist digestion resulting in high bioavailability,\u201d potentially allowing \u201cthe cellular mechanisms of the host to utilize the full potential of the\u2026dramatic anti-cancer benefits\u201d lectins have to offer. But, these dramatic benefits have yet to be demonstrated in people. We do know, however, that population studies show \u201cthat the consumption of a plant-based diet is strongly associated with a reduced risk of developing certain types of cancer.\u201d People eating a plant-based diet could just be eating fewer carcinogens, but plants do have all those active components that do seem to protect against the \u201cinitiation, promotion, or progression\u201d of cancer. So, maybe lectins are one of those protective compounds. We know people who eat more beans and whole grains tend to get less cancer overall, but we\u2019re just not sure exactly why. Now, you could say, \u201cWho cares why?\u201d Well, Big Pharma cares. You can\u2019t make as much money on healthy foods as you can on \u201clectin based drugs.\u201d  \n>  \n>  \n>  \n>Interested in learning more about lectins? Check out my videos Dr. Gundry\u2019s The Plant Paradox Is Wrong and How to Avoid Lectin Poisoning.  \n>  \n>Lectins remind me of the story about phytates. Other components of beans and whole grains, phytates were thought at first to be harmful, but, more recently, evidence is coming to light that suggests the opposite may be true. Check out Phytates for Rehabilitating Cancer Cells and Phytates for the Prevention of Osteoporosis.  \n>  \n>What else may explain the protective effect of beans? See, for example, Gut Dysbiosis: Starving Our Microbial Self.

Typical TER for o&g actively managed funds (more expensive than their passive ones, which they say gives the majority of their exposure) are around 0.4%, so they got <0.00004% of 10 trillion a year from Russian securities as a whole. Probably 10x less if it's all through passive indexes. Most of which is probably fossil (Russia has little else going for it, but not entirely). As a fraction of their overall operation, I don't think Blackrock gave a damn whatsoever what happened to Russia or its fossil fuel companies. \n\nI think them \"simply responding to the market\" is an agnostic force in all this IMO. The real crime lies in govs not taxing the negative externalities properly when carbon is extracted at the source. BlackRock catches a lot of hate for all the investments they facilite but if anything they have a bias for ESG positive investments rather than negative (to many hardcore capitalists' dismay https://twitter.com/jordanbpeterson/status/1483912213433925633/photo/1, his anger at this must mean it's not that bad a direction they're going in?). On top of that they see environmental investments as good for profit too, and climate change as a investment risk. Larry Fink will speak about this at every chance he gets, how the interests are aligned to not let climate change destroy us all. Then they take a slice in fees from everything. This could only possibly be perceived as them having a vested interest in oil and gas if you ignore everything else they do I think. In fact they are helping investors invest in more ESG conscious assets in a realistic (i.e. not a charitable-watch-your-money-burn-away in front of your eyes way too as is the case with many single stock clean energy start ups). It's still not easy money either, see here that neither their renewable nor fossil funds have been decent investments for quite a while now:\nhttps://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&timePeriod=4&startYear=1985&firstMonth=1&endYear=2022&lastMonth=12&calendarAligned=true&includeYTD=false&initialAmount=10000&annualOperation=0&annualAdjustment=0&inflationAdjusted=true&annualPercentage=0.0&frequency=4&rebalanceType=1&absoluteDeviation=5.0&relativeDeviation=25.0&leverageType=0&leverageRatio=0.0&debtAmount=0&debtInterest=0.0&maintenanceMargin=25.0&leveragedBenchmark=false&reinvestDividends=true&showYield=false&showFactors=false&factorModel=3&benchmark=VFINX&portfolioNames=false&portfolioName1=Portfolio+1&portfolioName2=Portfolio+2&portfolioName3=Portfolio+3&symbol1=ICLN&allocation1_1=100&symbol2=IEZ&allocation2_2=100&symbol3=IEO&allocation3_3=100\n\n\nI think the fault lies mostly with a dumb global electorate, partly misled by the fossil industry but mostly their own ignorance, consistently voting against their own long term interest and never researching their vote properly, and someone who is being paid by oil. Academics have been warning us for decades and people are still allowed to buy SUVs and steak, flying several times a year, commute to office type work 10x/week, as if it's normal. I don't think any of these are required to have a good capitalist stock market. It's just greed and stupidity. \n\nThere needs to be a massive tax when natural resources especially fossil fuels are taken out of the ground, that's then redistributed more fairly among the public in some way instead, and banning any further fossil incentives. Toxic incentives are anything but a free market either. This goes for everything in capitalism, it is efficient in principle but the buck for the negative externalities is always passed along. Same for meat and dairy, logging...\n\nFinally this is all assuming Blackrock are actually behaving the way they say they are, so there has to be oversight & regulation just as with everything but so far I just don't relate to the narrative that Larry Fink is out to conquer and destroy the world.

Technically it is called \"exit tax\" after a deemed disposal under the gross roll up regime (which is also applied to the dividends, and prevents tax loss harvesting). Regular capital gains tax, like what everyone else in Europe is taxed under, is what we're trying to achieve (that would enable rebalancing portfolios, no 8 yearly deemed disposal, income tax on dividends)\n\nI know it doesn't exempt me from capital gains tax, but it does give me access to some US ETFs as a non-professional investor (you need to meet a certain thresholds on account size, trade sizes and frequency over last year, etc)\n\nThe CGT allowance is 1270 eur and it does not apply for ETFs under the GRU. It is only for CGT securities. There is no rebalancing with UCITS ETFs and the like.\n\nMy understanding was that since tastyworks is regulated by the US and not by the EU (for now) it does not have to comply with MiFiD II.

Many devices will run CPUs faster while plugged in to a charger. Since this level of performance is not even available to the user without being plugged in, it's not fair to even present this as an alternative in a comparison.

This is what the entire rest of the retail investing world chooses in order to target sectors, location, asset classes, while trusts are just mixed public and private equity with a random amount of leverage decided by management. There are ETFs for most things you never even thought of but investment trusts don't even cover basic things like indeces at range of precise leverages, while -1x, 2x, 3x are available through ETFs for most things. all world bond funds and other fixed income, covered call strategies, world indeces hedged to x currency, commodities, ESG preferences, factor ETFs, and certain special ones like meme ETFs or insider trading ETFs are ETFs not investment trusts. You can make really exact, efficient portfolios using etfs this way extremely cheaply. This is a whole world essentially made impossible because they usually require rebalancing (and ETF losses can't be offset in Ireland) to target specific risk profiles as part of the overall portfolio, let alone long holding periods of over 8 years.\n\nSecond, diversification, world index ETFs can have 9000-10000 holdings, while the highest I've seen for an investment trust was ~450 (fcit). This makes them less efficient, though for major indexes like s&p, msci world, there are equivalents that come acceptably close like JAM and FCIT.\n\nThey are closed end, meaning some will have a tendency to trade at 50% below NAV during a crisis. ETFs usually have <<%1 tracking error to their holdings\n\nTalking about tracking error to their benchmark, this actually completely depends on management performance, as clowns can come in to take over at any moment and underperform their target index. This leads to sell pressure and even further discount to NAV (people with the option will just buy an index fund of the benchmark). Then it may or may not get liquidated on a continual vote at the AGM and you have to pay CGT tax. Worse, you pay these managers a high fee with charges typically in the 0.5%-2% range excl. ongoing charges of another 0.8% vs a low TER of 0.08% for a passively managed fund like VT by vanguard in the USA.\n\nActively managed ETFs tend to be cheaper too if you were wanting to go that route. It's not that active management is inherently bad always, it's that the structure of trusts makes it too expensive while there is no passive equivalent.\n\nWe are paying stamp duty and dividend tax to the UK gov instead of the Irish gov. They have a monopoly on this, and I feel like most of us would rather support Ireland over the UK. Lol.\n\nRevenue could change their minds and suddenly tax unrealized investment trust gains too arguing they are similar enough to funds, making you quickly sell and pay cgt.

It's hard to emphasize just how hard this fucks up the compounding. There is no efficient \"bogle\" style investing in Ireland, instead we are pushed towards large American holding companies and UK investment trusts and less efficient portfolios. The fees and taxes that eat you alive compared to everywhere else in the world just end up going to fund managers, insurance funds, and businesses in other countries instead of the Irish government. Worse, everyone offshore is meanwhile buying Irish domiciled ETFs, as we are a tax haven for the rest of the world in this regard.

The way I asked them should make it a nail in the coffin (assuming they answer fully) with regards to US ETFs though. \n\nI also wondered about using CFDs. Unlike futures, they never expire. Have you thought about using them instead? I don't know anything about them but apparently they are available unleveraged (avoiding the margin fees). Then if they could be bought on upro/tmf the 3x leverage could still be reached without GRU.\n\nAs for shorter term treasuries, have you backtested this? I don't understand what you meant by \"locked for 30 years\". TMF is a leveraged bond fund, not a bond itself, they are continuously buying and selling bonds when they are issued and once they are sufficiently near expiry (say <20 years for a 30 Y bought 10 years ago). I also think the longer term treasuries were an intentional choice, as they are indeed more sensitive to interest rates for more volatility and negative correlation to UPRO during crashes that will save you when rebalancing, instead of their yield. Think about when yields go negative, their price will still go up, as the older bonds higher yielding bonds that the fund had already bought become more valuable closer to expiry and the new ones get closer to expiry.\n\nI also think long term bonds are safe in a rising rate environment, the danger is rates rising faster than the market expected, but that is hearsay not my own understanding.\n\nI could be completely wrong about this, I haven't read the 11000+ post thread on bogleheads.\n\nEdit: I spoke to soon, there is more theory to this than I realized https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=357281", "created_utc": "1643027992.0", "edited": "1643028413.0", "id": "hu0g286", "is_submitter": "True", "link_id": "t3_s3sowl", "parent_id": "t1_htftao2", "score": "2", "subreddit": "HFEA", "subreddit_id": "t5_4xw4i0"}, {"author": "apocalypsedg", "body": "Did you read/understand the parable?\n\nData centers are productive without requiring labour\n\nRequiring labour isn't what makes an economy strong\n\nIf, however, there were an excess labour supply, one good use of it might be using it to improve the lacking power grid, as you described it.", "created_utc": "1643002565.0", "edited": "False", "id": "htzh8ct", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_saxbup", "parent_id": "t1_htyqyky", "score": "1", "subreddit": "ireland", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhb9"}, {"author": "apocalypsedg", "body": "Just because something doesnt provide meaningless busywork doesn't mean it's bad.

Such sounds are not aspirated at the end of words or in combination with certain consonants (e.g., in \u201cspot,\u201d \u201cstop\u201d). The voiced stops b and d in Sanskrit and Hindi also have aspirated forms that are usually transliterated as bh and dh.\n\nhttps://www.britannica.com/topic/aspirate\n\ntl;dr Dutch speakers often aspirate when they shouldn't while they skip aspiration when they should in English", "created_utc": "1631613387.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hcsvq9x", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_pnm33a", "parent_id": "t1_hcsf2im", "score": "1", "subreddit": "AskEurope", "subreddit_id": "t5_2uayg"}, {"author": "apocalypsedg", "body": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EF_English_Proficiency_Index\nThey're literally #1 though\n\nStill, it's naturally not at all great compared to countries where it is spoken natively. Worse, I think they often aren't aware of just how bad their accents are compared to us because the mutual intelligibility is still _extremely_ high. The accent is actually quite aggravating, but I like to think of it as a reflection of the Dutch language itself, something I think we can be quite proud of - you can have your romantic Italian, but let us keep our grating Dutch.\n\nI am a native speaker in both languages, so here are two quick tips for Dutch people to improve their English that pretty much literally every single one of you guys do wrong:\n\nYou mistakenly pronounce the English vowel a like the Dutch vowel e, when it should be much closer to the Dutch \"aa\". So for \"to have\" think, \"to haav\" not \"to hef\". Importantly, \"than\" is not \"then\" (some poorly educated native English speakers might confuse the two, yet they would still be able to pronounce each properly if shown them, while Dutch people tend to understand the grammar but mispronounce). I think this is partly due to mixing American and British English vowels, sometimes I hear Dutch speakers say the vowel like \"aww\" too, as if they felt like imitating queen elizabeth ii for just that one single word in the middle of a sentence (\"awwfter\"). In Ireland some accents say this \"a\" even higher (\"caaaar\"), while in American English it's a bit lower, but I don't think natives anywhere else on Earth say it the way Dutch people often do.\n\nYou pronounce many consonants in English as if they were Dutch consonants.  For example the t in the word tip. Dutch speakers, try to say this word out loud in Dutch and in English - if they sounded the same to you, you are guilty of this mispronunciation. In Dutch that t isn't voiced but in English it is, i.e. we exhale. Similarly sometimes Dutch speakers will voice consonants at the end of words when English speakers wouldn't.\nI can't list each example of where you guys do this but it just sounds jarring to native English speakers every time and it's instantly recognizable.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egdMwxAFl4\nto compare and contrast^", "created_utc": "1631576347.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hcr6t5f", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_pnm33a", "parent_id": "t1_hcqvjui", "score": "6", "subreddit": "AskEurope", "subreddit_id": "t5_2uayg"}, {"author": "apocalypsedg", "body": "I think it's better to look at the nutrition facts for dry lentils, as the water content is gonna vary massively with cooking time otherwise.", "created_utc": "1631534335.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hcoijsv", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_pnc4fs", "parent_id": "t1_hcociua", "score": "15", "subreddit": "nutrition", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qoox"}, {"author": "apocalypsedg", "body": "> Y lo otro... \u00bfPorqu\u00e9 la mayor\u00eda de los post en este sub est\u00e1n en ingl\u00e9s?\n\nno te olvides que hay https://www.reddit.com/r/espanol solo para ustedes nativos tambi\u00e9n\n\nEs como que ir a https://www.reddit.com/r/ingles/ y preguntarse por qu\u00e9 hay tanto espa\u00f1ol:p", "created_utc": "1631478272.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hclul02", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_pmxwqd", "parent_id": "t3_pmxwqd", "score": "3", "subreddit": "Spanish", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qtt1"}, {"author": "apocalypsedg", "body": "it would have gripped the helmet, twisted his neck and completely shaken him apart, 1000 bhp to a human body is no joke (okay, it might only be << 1% of the max power output - he's not revving and a lot of the power will go to the other wheel thanks to the diff) but there is NO WAY it's just sliding his helmet up gently up against the back of his seat", "created_utc": "1631473649.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hclisdh", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_pmtwub", "parent_id": "t1_hclb2ie", "score": "7", "subreddit": "formula1", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qimj"}, {"author": "apocalypsedg", "body": "This is true but these damn brokerages take forever to finish signing up for if you actually take the time to read what they say you should read, with all their legal forms and shit, it's not smart to rush through unless you have experience, besides it wasn't much effort to check", "created_utc": "1631360268.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hcfaeww", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_plqefj", "parent_id": "t1_hccrgqf", "score": "1", "subreddit": "eupersonalfinance", "subreddit_id": "t5_2w5jv"}, {"author": "apocalypsedg", "body": "I checked, no matching records found for ZZUC on degiro, sorry\n\nI'm going to make an IB account today probably, they actually recently did away with all their maintenance fees and account minimums and also opened an office in my city.", "created_utc": "1631348605.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hcewh26", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_plqefj", "parent_id": "t1_hcepkme", "score": "1", "subreddit": "eupersonalfinance", "subreddit_id": "t5_2w5jv"}, {"author": "apocalypsedg", "body": "you forgot about ending some killer arguments with \"I don't know\"", "created_utc": "1631348125.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hcevy5z", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_plv00j", "parent_id": "t3_plv00j", "score": "9", "subreddit": "Destiny", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qnvz"}, {"author": "apocalypsedg", "body": "beginner here, bear in mind I could be searching wrong but for the first one on Degiro I found\n\nTRACKERS (ETFS)\nXET | 21XB | CH0454664001 | EUR |\n21Shares Bitcoin ETP\n\n\nI don't know if it's the same thing just named slightly differently or not.\n\n\nThere were no results when I searched \"CRYPTO20\"\n\n\nAnyway, I was thinking of switching to Interactive Brokers too, I tried to investigate selling \"covered calls\" yesterday but apparently it's quite a hard thing to do on Degiro, IB seems like a more powerful one in general but I think they charge monthly fees unless you're a big baller.\n\nI'm in Ireland", "created_utc": "1631300448.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hcch639", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_plqefj", "parent_id": "t3_plqefj", "score": "1", "subreddit": "eupersonalfinance", "subreddit_id": "t5_2w5jv"}, {"author": "apocalypsedg", "body": "Second this, the p version (precision) seemed like the best quality option for the price after a lot of reading.\n\nI'm very happy with mine, I actually got the r6006pw but haven't used the wifi thing yet\n\nI'd recommend the case and SMPS with it too.", "created_utc": "1631274882.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hcautmp", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_plh8an", "parent_id": "t1_hcaoigv", "score": "2", "subreddit": "AskElectronics", "subreddit_id": "t5_2se13"}, {"author": "apocalypsedg", "body": "Definitely not a safe or healthy stunt to even attempt, you should have thought about this months ago.

Furthermore, other organisms closely related to Spirulina may cohabit in the pools in which it is farmed, and produce neurotoxic BMAA. This article (https://www.pnas.org/content/102/14/5074.long) explains the ubiquity of BMAA contamination among a diverse taxa of cyanobacteria: \"...We report here that a single neurotoxin, \u03b2-N-methylamino-L-alanine, may be produced by all known groups of cyanobacteria, including cyanobacterial symbionts and free-living cyanobacteria\".  \nUnfortunately the B12 it contains is not the type of B12 that you want to be eating, it's an analog or pseudovitamin, on which I have found conflicting sources of it displacing actual B12 absorption or simply not doing anything.\n\nalso, this (they are shady)\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/nutrition/comments/luap8w/is\\_taking\\_spirulina\\_worth\\_it\\_knowing\\_it\\_may/gp5yqxv?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/nutrition/comments/luap8w/is_taking_spirulina_worth_it_knowing_it_may/gp5yqxv?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)", "created_utc": "1627305866.0", "edited": "False", "id": "h6l18g7", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_oruhw5", "parent_id": "t1_h6l0slm", "score": "1", "subreddit": "veganfitness", "subreddit_id": "t5_2smq8"}, {"author": "apocalypsedg", "body": "including neuro and nephrotoxins, steer clear from this one guys...", "created_utc": "1627298262.0", "edited": "False", "id": "h6kpaqc", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_oruhw5", "parent_id": "t1_h6kkuq0", "score": "12", "subreddit": "veganfitness", "subreddit_id": "t5_2smq8"}, {"author": "apocalypsedg", "body": "What is the point of this study?", "created_utc": "1627240983.0", "edited": "False", "id": "h6i67yr", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_orcof9", "parent_id": "t3_orcof9", "score": "1", "subreddit": "ScientificNutrition", "subreddit_id": "t5_qgptn"}, {"author": "apocalypsedg", "body": "I mean, no one expects their dog to be stupid enough to attack a literal horse though...idk, maybe you're right.", "created_utc": "1627125529.0", "edited": "False", "id": "h6cs8pa", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_oq3hyg", "parent_id": "t1_h6a60l2", "score": "1", "subreddit": "PublicFreakout", "subreddit_id": "t5_2yrq6"}, {"author": "apocalypsedg", "body": "Are the refining costs of petrol not relevant? genuine question.", "created_utc": "1627125197.0", "edited": "False", "id": "h6crulp", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_oq1pt6", "parent_id": "t1_h6clrgh", "score": "0", "subreddit": "energy", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhkd"}, {"author": "apocalypsedg", "body": "Naturally aspirated engines with just 1.6 l displacement, only used for calm weekend cruises, don't forget...", "created_utc": "1627113949.0", "edited": "False", "id": "h6cftze", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_oq6v25", "parent_id": "t1_h6a5na0", "score": "1", "subreddit": "formula1", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qimj"}, {"author": "apocalypsedg", "body": "I was raised bilingually, I speak English with an Irish accent not a Dutch one, but I was raised in the Netherlands, I went to primary school there and lived there for over a decade.\n\nMaybe you are thinking of an American pronunciation of the word angst, in which case I could kinda see where you're coming from with the Dutch engst.

Also, writing systems do not even necessarily convey an exact pronunciation in their o language, let alone a generalized one suitable for everyone: \n\n> For example, the English words kid and kit end with two distinct phonemes, /d/ and /t/, and swapping one for the other would change one word into a different word. However, the difference between the /p/ sounds in pun ([p\u02b0], with aspiration) and spun ([p], without aspiration) never affects the meaning or identity of a word in English. Therefore, [p] cannot be replaced with [p\u02b0] (or vice versa) and thereby convert one word to another. That causes [p\u02b0] and [p] to be two distinct phones but not distinct phonemes in English.\nBy contrast, swapping the same two sounds in Hindustani can change one word into another: [p\u02b0al] (\u092b\u0932) means 'fruit', and [pal] (\u092a\u0932) means 'moment' (CIIL 2008). The sounds are thus different phonemes.\nAs can be seen in those examples, phonemes, rather than phones, are the features of speech that are typically reflected (more or less imperfectly) in a writing systems.\n\nI change my name in each of the 3 languages I speak.

Even if they manage the consonants they will screw up the stresses, vowels, etc., things we literally just don't have in English. I have no doubt I do the exact same for literally every driver with a name in a foreign language with a different phonology. Thus for consistency we should just anglicize everything.\n\nOf course formula 1 is a global sport so you might think, everyone should have a small basic amount of familiarity with the pronunciation of the foreign names, but I say no, fuck that, we can't even begin to make that judgement as to how good our attempts at approximating it are as someone who doesn't speak the language.", "created_utc": "1622928158.0", "edited": "False", "id": "h0q804o", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_nsvw9q", "parent_id": "t1_h0q4onx", "score": "-2", "subreddit": "formula1", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qimj"}, {"author": "apocalypsedg", "body": "pretty much every single animal product https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gqwpfEcBjI", "created_utc": "1622923179.0", "edited": "False", "id": "h0py659", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_nse3et", "parent_id": "t3_nse3et", "score": "2", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i"}]
