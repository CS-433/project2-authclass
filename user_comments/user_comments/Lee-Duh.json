Is this your video? :) If it is, may I have a little request? I see that Egyptian Arabic for example has few different versions of the sentence. Could you please add some type of explanation for each version?

Like they're just a bad, lazy person. And each person answered yes. For me personally? I've felt like shit, like I'm just making stuff up to excuse my bad behavior. And I still do when I have my low days. I think this is totally normal for a person with ADHD, especially considering we grew up doubting ourselves. Untreated ADHD also often has anxiety or/and depression as a comorbidity which also does not help us.\n\nSeriously though, after the wrong diagnosis I really felt like I was making stuff up and when my family came with the idea to get second opinion, I felt like a loser who seeks a doctor who would agree - and not a doctor who knows their stuff.\nBut when you do it and get the diagnosis, you'll just be happy that you're getting help, it's worth it. :)\n\nHere's the link to the FB post: https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=304788014659698&id=100053855042804", "created_utc": "1624031021.0", "edited": "False", "id": "h27ywfp", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_o2lt2g", "parent_id": "t1_h27va42", "score": "1", "subreddit": "ADHD", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qnwb"}, {"author": "Lee-Duh", "body": "Sorry, my writing is sometimes messy :D\n\nI went to the first diagnosis where I scored average in tests so the psychologist told me there's no way I have ADHD - I'd have worse results if I truly we're ADHD.
