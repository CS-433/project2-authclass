I can write roughly 2300 kanji, although I might forget which kanji is in which word if I were to write sentences, since I haven't focused on writing out full sentences by hand much.\n\n1) I feel like the difficulty of learning kanji is just being consistent and doing it. It's not hard or easy. There's just a lot of them.\n\n2) Taking breaks and forgetting how to read/write a bunch of characters was frustrating, and a bit of a mental barrier, but I realized after a while that characters I had learned before came back quicker when relearning them. Also the sheer number of kanji that you need to learn to read is intimidating.\n\n3) Focusing on learning kanji that occurred in the vocabulary I was learning was a huge improvement. Originally I had been using the grade levels to structure my kanji learning, but I realized that there were too many characters that I wasn't really encountering in vocabulary that way, and also that I wasn't learning the characters that I was encountering. Also consistently learning a few new kanji per day has also been an improvement. Instead of learning 10-20/week as I did originally in my Japanese classes, I learned 5/day at the start before dropping down to 4 and then 3/day as reviews started to mount. Even 3 per day is 21 new characters/week though, so it's still more than I was learning in my Japanese classes, and it also felt more effective and like less work doing it daily compared to weekly.\n\n4) If I started over I'm not sure what I'd change. To some extent I'd use more or less my current learning strategy from the start, but if I were restarting, I wouldn't know the radicals, common components, phonetic components etc., so I'm not sure if my current method would be as effective.\n\n5) My experience has been that yes there are a lot of kanji, but ultimately there are a finite number of them, and there's a lot of other stuff to learn in the language. It's best (at least in my personal experience) to just do some small amount of practice daily, focusing on characters that are relevant to you, and not let kanji study occupy too much of your time. After all, 3 characters/day for one year is 1,095 characters, and 5 per day is 1,825 characters. If you're studying casually, even 1,000 characters is plenty of characters to be learning in your first year, and if you have more time to study daily, then you can up the number of characters per day. Of course if you're starting off at the beginning it's harder to learn characters, so idk if that's actually feasible to do when starting out, since that's not what I did.

However, in the English phrase \"magic place,\" magic is functioning as an adjective modifying place. In the Japanese it's not an adjective, so it's more like \"spell place,\" rather than \"magic place,\" in that sense. If it were to be an adjective in Japanese, needs the possessive marker, \u306e(no), making it \u9b54\u6cd5\u306e\u6240(mahouno tokoro). However that's not what the name is, so let's assume that using magic as a noun was deliberate. After all, compound words are fine and do exist. However, in this case that means that tokoro is functioning as a suffix. Which means I'd expect it to undergo a sound change that it usually does when functioning as a suffix and become dokoro, making it mahoudokoro.

They may just be fragments of a longer phrase, like \u3053\u3093\u306b\u3061\u306f or \"good morning.\" Arguably a requirement for something to be a set phrase is that it is still parseable as a phrase in the language rather than a single word. The wiki page for set phrase (phraseme) lists \"hearty laugh,\" \"stark naked,\" and \"infinite patience\" as examples. The evidence for these being set phrases is that you can't mix and match the intensifiers. I.e. \"stark patience,\" \"hearty naked,\" etc. aren't valid phrases. This is also why \"good morning\" is a set phrase, you can't swap out \"good\" with \"nice\" and still get the same meaning.", "created_utc": "1663019754.0", "edited": "False", "id": "io6f0g1", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_xcm79x", "parent_id": "t1_io6cjm8", "score": "7", "subreddit": "LearnJapanese", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qyls"}, {"author": "jragonfyre", "body": "Good morning, good evening, good night, etc. They're used as greetings, but taken literally they're incomplete sentences, mere noun phrases.

Similarly, for Italian the only benefit to you personally from learning Italian that you listed was that you could travel comfortably in Italy. If that's something you anticipate doing frequently one day then that might be a pretty big pro, but if it's more speculative, or you'll only go a few times, then it doesn't seem worth studying the language to me. \n\nIdk, maybe this is more of a personal opinion of mine, but I think without a personal connection to/benefit from the language, it's hard to recommend that someone study the language, at least to a high level. If you want to study a language to an A1-2 level because you're traveling there, that seems totally reasonable to me, but if you're studying to B1-B2 or beyond I feel like you really need a stronger reason. Otherwise I think it's pretty common to hit a \"what's the point?\" wall, like you did with Mandarin. After all, studying any language to a high level takes a lot of time and energy. \n\nSome examples of some common more personal reasons/specific benefits to learning a language: (1) you live where it's spoken, or you're planning to, (2) you have family/close friends who are native/heritage speakers, (3) your community has a lot of (proficient) speakers of the language, (4) your job (or prospective job) requires it, or will pay you more if you learn the language, or you'll become better at your job for having learned the language, (5) you have an obsession with media in that language, or a hobby that comes from a culture that uses the language.\n\nIdk I'm pulling these reasons from my own experience and the experiences of people I know.

Firstly, most information is classified using a system created by an executive order, which is why the president can declassify it, however information relating to nuclear materials is classified by statute, and the president cannot unilaterally declassify it. Secondly, classified documents even once declassified must be treated as classified until they are modified to remove the classification level and marked declassified with the date and declassification authority (or something along these lines). \n\nBoth of these caveats appear to apply here, at least if the reports that some of the documents pertain to the nuclear arsenal are to believed. Otherwise the second caveat still applies. Finally, the classification level is irrelevant anyway, since the laws in question apparently don't require the information to be classified in the first place.\n\nFor your third point, one can certainly entertain that thought. However, frankly I agree with the OP that it's somewhat implausible that letters from Kim Jong Un would be classified as top secret, unless they contained information on that level, in which case I don't see how it being a letter from Kim Jong Un makes Trump less culpable. The reality is that if at least some of these documents were classified as top secret, then regardless of what the documents are, they probably shouldn't have been taken and stored in this manner, legally speaking.

Duolingo gamifies learning. It will teach you some language, but it also makes you want to keep using Duolingo. And eventually it runs out of stuff to teach you.

That said, I don't currently have a language partner or tutor, so I haven't tried this myself.\n\nAnyway, I also want to add that you might want to reconsider if this is a good use of your time. If words are not showing up frequently enough in your input that you see them multiple times, then they're probably not the words that you need to be learning right now. After all, not seeing the word again is a pretty good indication that the word is low frequency in the content that you are consuming right now. Certainly you'll need to learn low frequency words eventually, but until you start to notice, oh I keep seeing this word and I can never remember it, I'm not sure deliberate practice is particularly helpful.", "created_utc": "1659445438.0", "edited": "False", "id": "iimz8hf", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_wdp10q", "parent_id": "t3_wdp10q", "score": "1", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "jragonfyre", "body": "With regards to Japanese and Spanish phonology: They're very very close.

Phonology (production and listening)\n2. Listening comprehension \n3. Reading\n4. Speaking \n5. Writing\n\nGenerally I consider auditory skills to be more primary (for a beginner) than written skills and input to be more important than output.\n\nAnyway, perhaps my focus on phonology/pronunciation comes from the fact that the first language I've studied on my own where I knew what I was doing was Mandarin, for which it's necessary and fairly standard to start with a heavy focus on phonology, since it's quite different from English. There was quite a lot of training required to build the muscle memory for the new sounds. \n\nPerhaps if the phonology of your TL is more similar to your native language it wouldn't be as important to study right away.", "created_utc": "1658702808.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ihi8ki6", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_w6trxz", "parent_id": "t3_w6trxz", "score": "3", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "jragonfyre", "body": "Yeah I guess I think of codes as being any schema for transmitting information (or I guess converting information is the wiki definition). \n\nBut yeah alphabet is definitely more of a written thing, that's a good point.

Also while genres could be considered a domain, they're a bit fuzzy and tend to consist of several smaller families of words. \n\nFor example, many kinds of media contain words from both the politics and fantasy domains. High fantasy stories or \"court intrigue in a fantasy world\" stories tend to feature words from both domains heavily.\n\nPretty much any combination of these domains could appear in a given piece of media Culinary and fantasy? A story about a chef in another world. Business and psychology? Entrepreneur self help books. \n\nAnyway, the problem with making an exhaustive list of domains is it's not really possible to do. They're just collections of words that are used in a given context. You could define a narrower context and get a more specific set of words, or a broader one and get a less specific set of words.

To some extent that depends on both the individual as well as their goals.\n\nAnyway, here are the pros and cons of sentence cards as I see them. First the pros\n\n1. Sentence cards more closely adhere to the test one thing principle specifically in the sense that they narrow the question to did you understand the word as it was used in this specific context, rather than could you recall up to around three common meanings of the word. Of course if you grade yourself on pronunciation of the word/sentence then once again, this is no longer one thing, but presumably you'd be doing that with the vocab too. \n\n2. Sentence cards are easier (imo) to grade than dictionary cards. Of course this depends on how you grade both types of cards, but I personally have zero interest in memorizing the English (or Japanese) definition of a particular Japanese word. I'm a lot more interested in acquiring the word than learning it. So I find it tricky to grade dictionary cards, because I find it hard to evaluate whether my understanding of the word adequately measures up to the definition on the back (not to mention that even when reading a dictionary, some definitions are confusing or unclear). Sentence cards on the other hand I can grade easily by asking myself if I understood what the sentence said.\n\n3. Sentence cards give you the word in a sentence, in particular you get at least one grammatical usage of the word in a sentence. For example if this word usually collocates with another word, then it'll probably be in the example sentence.\n\n4. (If you have native sentence audio like the Core6k deck) if you care about your accent/speaking Japanese to Japanese people, audio sentence decks give you a great opportunity to practice your pronunciation from a beginner level before building bad habits from subvocalizing incorrectly (idk how hard it is to correct these habits for everyone, but in my experience correcting pronunciation habits has been extremely challenging). Of course this depends on your goals, but if you do want to speak to Japanese people, many beginners find Japanese pronunciation to be extremely challenging. Even putting aside pitch accent, native English speakers (myself included) seem to struggle with getting vowel length correct. \n\nCons\n\n1. Time. This is obviously the big con with sentence cards. They take far, far, far longer to review than dictionary cards, particularly if you're also practicing your pronunciation by reading the sentence out loud and imitating the audio. \n\n2. Too much context. I'm going to include this as a con, although I've never personally found this to be an issue, because I know some people do have an issue with this. My understanding of this issue is that some people find that they understand the word in the example sentence and then run across it in the wild and don't understand it. Of course that's to be expected to a certain extent for any kind of flashcards, since aiming for 100% retention is another good way of wasting your time, but my impression is that these people say that they end up memorizing the sentence and what the sentence means instead of acquiring the word itself, so this happens much more frequently with sentence cards compared to dictionary cards for them.\n\nAnyway, I've listed 4 pros and 2 cons, but in no way does that mean that sentence cards are just better overall. For one thing, both of the cons are massive, and if the second con applies to you then it's probably a fatal flaw with sentence cards, and I'd just avoid them. And flaw 1 applies to basically everyone. There's just no realistic way it's taking you less time to read a sentence in Japanese than a single word (on average).\n\nPersonally for me, the pros outweigh the time flaw, particularly because I can do Anki on my commute, but I can't read on my commute, so I generally have quite a bit of time that's available to do Anki in a day. However, that's definitely not the case for everyone.\n\nAnyway, I hope I was able to be fairly objective about sentence cards vs dictionary cards, and if anyone has any thoughts or feedback, I'd be interested in hearing it.", "created_utc": "1658160502.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ignok1n", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_w1plyx", "parent_id": "t3_w1plyx", "score": "2", "subreddit": "LearnJapanese", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qyls"}, {"author": "jragonfyre", "body": "Out of curiosity what do you mean by \"Zelensky is a Nazi\"?

Production cards are pretty tricky to use though, and normal production cards lack context for the vocabulary. Idk maybe if you've got a good deck of cloze cards, but I never understood how those were supposed to work.

A more realistic expectation for self study of these languages is 2200 hours or more. \n\n(c) Let's say that you do end up with 5,000 words of active vocabulary at the end of all of this. It's not clear from this study plan where the extra passive vocabulary is coming from. I assume it's supposed to be coming from words you looked up while reading or picked up passively but didn't put into Anki. However, for most of this time period you won't be picking up much if any passive vocabulary in this manner, since you don't have a sufficient base of vocabulary to build on (for example you can't do extensive reading). And at least for Japanese, you probably need around ~10k passive vocabulary to be around B2 level comprehension.\n\n(d) This also seems to disregard the added difficulty of learning to read kanji/hanzi if you're learning Japanese or Chinese. \n\nAnyway, this just seems fairly optimistic as a plan to me, but it's not really a bad plan overall.", "created_utc": "1657908451.0", "edited": "False", "id": "igakn3w", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_vzr89b", "parent_id": "t1_iga5w54", "score": "16", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "jragonfyre", "body": "Yeah that makes sense", "created_utc": "1657863944.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ig8ai49", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_vyxcoi", "parent_id": "t1_ig88nmo", "score": "1", "subreddit": "linguisticshumor", "subreddit_id": "t5_2vwiq"}, {"author": "jragonfyre", "body": "Why'd you spell eventually iventjuli, shouldn't it be iventculi(i?)?

It takes so long to build the necessary automatic auditory processing skills to get your listening speed up to part with the speed at which people talk even for simple sentences. It's so frustrating when people say something to me in Mandarin and it takes my brain an extra second or two to process what was said and come up with a reply, if I'm replying in English, let alone replying in Mandarin.

I pronounce the word and then the example sentence out loud. On the back there's the reading info (including pitch accent), word audio, sentence audio and English meanings of the words and sentences. I pass the card if I understood the word in the context of the sentence and pronounced it correctly (including pitch accent).\n\nMandarin: 3 decks\n\nHanzi deck: Since I was already familiar with at least 1.5k kanji when I started learning Mandarin, I needed a way to translate that knowledge into useful Mandarin skill. This deck goes from Simplified Hanzi and example words on the front to Simplified, Shinjitai (Kanji) and Traditional forms on the back, with common pinyin, an English meaning, and an audio recording of a native pronouncing the character's most common reading or an example word for the character.\n\nHSK vocabulary deck: This has been my default source of vocabulary for a while. It's set up essentially the same way as the Core6k deck above, so I won't say much more about this.\n\nCustomized Spoonfed Chinese deck: having learned around 2.1k words from the HSK vocabulary deck and gone through 1.8k characters in the Hanzi deck, I found that my reading ability in Mandarin is far higher than my listening ability. There isn't a whole lot of comprehensible listening material at my level, so I decided to take the Spoonfed Chinese deck and use it for listening practice. The fronts contain an audio only sentence and nothing else. The back is the transcription of the audio in simplified and traditional with pinyin hidden until mouseover, as well as the English translation and any notes for the card underneath. I pass cards here if I understood the sentence correctly. (Note that I don't mean translating the sentence into English in my head.)\n\nOverall I probably cover about 30 new cards/day split between the various decks. 2 new kanji/day, 0 new genki/day (I'm done with the deck for learning purposes), 10 new Core6k cards/day (usually), 5 hanzi cards/day (at least until I catch up with my Japanese kanji knowledge), 4 hsk cards/day (used to be 8 before adding the Spoonfed Chinese deck), and 10 new spoonfed Chinese cards/day (these go relatively quickly though, since I'm not reading a sentence out loud).", "created_utc": "1657491077.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ifndbnp", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_vvyomc", "parent_id": "t3_vvyomc", "score": "3", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "jragonfyre", "body": "That's an excellent question and it's a bit complicated to answer since there are many versions of the decks floating around. \n\nThe one I have has all 6k cards in one deck and they're sorted so that the \"easier\" (more frequent, usually learned early) words are at the beginning. In that case you could go into the card browser, select the first 1-2 thousand (or however many) and delete or suspend them. \n\nAnother alternative, depending on how many words you expect to know, you can delete/suspend words that you already know as you come across them. This might be a pain if you already expect to know like 3k words, but it's probably not super annoying if you know like 1-2k. There should be a keyboard shortcut to suspend cards when they show up in review.  \n\nFinally the last alternative is to just review them anyway. This is somewhat counterintuitive as a solution, but the idea is of they're super easy for you you should press the easy button and they'll show up much less often, and if you think you know a word, but it turns out you don't, or you know it now, but forget it in like 2 months, then it'll show up and remind you again. \n\n(I personally actually did the last alternative here.

Anyway so the version I'd suggest for this sentence (using both \u591a\u5206 and \u601d\u3046) would be \n\u627f\u592a\u90ce\u3055\u3093\u306f\u3001\u591a\u5206\u3001\u5148\u751f\u306e\u90e8\u5c4b\u306b\u3044\u308b\u3068\u601d\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002\nI'm not saying that's a good sentence, and I think it sounds better to me with one of the two removed, but as a non-native this sounds ok, not great, but ok.\n\nOh, I just saw the second page is the English version, yeah I'd just get rid of \u591a\u5206.\n\nThe furigana on \u751f\u7269\u5b66 should be \u305b\u3044\u3076\u3064\u304c\u304f not \u3044\u304d\u3082\u306e\u304c\u304f.\n\nAlso you have a weird mix of formal and informal speech.

If you end up liking Japanese media that could change the advice below.\n\nHowever, based on what you've currently written I'd strongly recommend choosing Korean. \n\nThe interest factors currently lie in favor of Korean. An interest in the media of a language is ultimately much more important than appreciating the sound of a language. That's because to learn a language to a reasonable level you need at a minimum lots and lots of exposure to that language, which requires you to consume a lot of media in that language. That's a lot easier to do if you like the media you're consuming. \n\nAs for the difficulty of pronunciation vs the writing systems, again this factor goes in favor of Korean. In my experience, yes, learning new sounds and phonology can be quite tricky, but it's ultimately a rather small and finite difficulty (which (imo) you should focus on in the beginning and return to periodically). On the other hand, learning kanji is a much larger obstacle. It's not as large of an obstacle as many people make it out to be when learning only to read kanji (as opposed to learning to handwrite as well), since you also have to learn all of the vocabulary in the first place. It's not like you need to learn all of the common kanji first before starting to learn Japanese, but it's definitely an extra thing to learn as you go along that's going to slow you down. Unknown kanji will get less and less frequent as time goes by, but they won't disappear completely.\n\nA caveat to the last point, my impression is that while you don't need to learn Chinese characters to read Korean (at least in 99% of situations in modern Korean), at an intermediate to high level it can be useful to learn Chinese characters because they form the root words of a huge amount of vocabulary in modern Korean. (It's somewhat similar to studying Latin or Greek roots in English) That said, even if you do eventually study Chinese characters while learning Korean, it's definitely not mandatory.\n\nFor context, I've never learned Korean, but I am at an intermediate level in Japanese, and an upper beginner level in Mandarin (relevant because it also has relatively difficult phonology for a native English speaker, although different phonology from Korean.)\n\nAnyway, take everything you read with a grain of salt, including this, and I hope this helps!", "created_utc": "1656522066.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ie7gvmw", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_vmz56j", "parent_id": "t3_vmz56j", "score": "3", "subreddit": "thisorthatlanguage", "subreddit_id": "t5_4inj8f"}, {"author": "jragonfyre", "body": "Update ATOK is region locked and also seems to require a subscription", "created_utc": "1656260747.0", "edited": "False", "id": "idtl3qh", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_vk9gfw", "parent_id": "t1_idtkg7u", "score": "1", "subreddit": "LearningJapanese", "subreddit_id": "t5_3blqk"}, {"author": "jragonfyre", "body": "Just did some googling.

The sense in which they know all of the readings for \u751f is that they can read the words in which it appears. As for going the other direction, it's not really a useful skill. However a native Japanese person can tell you the onyomi for most kanji.\n\nThe helpful thing to keep in mind here is that English and Latin are directly analogous to Japanese and Chinese. The main difference is that Latin is written with an alphabet and Chinese is written with logograms. \n\nSo for example take the latin root \"cor\" meaning heart. From this root we derive the English word \"core.\" Now imagine that Latin had been written with logograms, so there was a symbol which I'll write <cor> that is pronounced \"cor\" in Latin. Let's say we borrowed this symbol into English to write some words, let's say we could read <cor> as \"core\", \"heart\", or \"love\" depending on context. Of these readings \"core\" is analogous to onyomi in Japanese, since it connects directly to the latin pronunciation of the symbol. On the other hand, the other two are English words whose pronunciation is completely unrelated to the symbol <cor>, but whose meaning is related to the symbol. These are analogous to kunyomi in Japanese. \n\nThe takeaway should be that kunyomi are contextually determined readings for a character that are just Japanese words with a related meaning. On the other hand, onyomi are the borrowed phonetic readings from Chinese. These are more contextually stable in the sense that most characters only have one onyomi and in compounds the character will generally be read with this reading regardless of context. In the case of two or more onyomi, this may be because the character only has one pronunciation in any given Chinese language, but words containing the character were borrowed from Chinese into Japanese multiple times (from different times or locations) and the Chinese pronunciation was different between the borrowings.

But yeah, everything I said above applies to learning shinjitai characters starting from simplified.\n\nSimplified characters generally have the biggest visual differences from the other two out of the three sets (simplified/traditional/shinjitai), but most of those differences are just regular simplifications of a few radicals, like \u8eca->\u8f66, \u99ac->\u9a6c, etc. Ignoring these regular substitutions all three sets of characters are substantially the same. According to the top answer to this [Quora question](https://www.quora.com/How-many-characters-are-the-same-in-both-simplified-and-traditional-Chinese), there are about 500 (350 + 152 phonetic substitutions) substantially different characters between simplified and traditional out of the easily 3000+ characters used in Mandarin. The figures should be similar for shinjitai and simplified and shinjitai and traditional, but I would expect the number of differences between shinjitai and each of the other two to be less than 500, since it's not quite, but roughly in the middle.\n\nSo to answer your question, yes, my answer still applies if you learned simplified Chinese first. If you've already done Simplified RTH I wouldn't really recommend doing it again for shinjitai kanji, and instead I'd focus on learning vocabulary to get used to how Japanese uses kanji.", "created_utc": "1655831836.0", "edited": "1655832098.0", "id": "id7cajq", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_vgsizz", "parent_id": "t1_id724ah", "score": "2", "subreddit": "japanese", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qmnp"}, {"author": "jragonfyre", "body": "This is technically inaccurate.

It comes across as if you're taking your own personal situation and opinions and just asserting that they apply to everyone else.\n\nTo be clear what follows is also largely my personal opinion and experience, but I'm not making any claims that it should be universal, just using it as a counterpoint to your opinions.\n\nI'll start off by conceding that I do more Anki than I should and more than I'd like to. That's not because I have multiple vocabulary decks, it's because I can do flashcards and not a whole lot else on my commute, so I let Anki take up that time.\n\nNow, why might someone have multiple vocabulary decks?\n\nWell here's why I have more than one. I was taking a Japanese class for a while, so I was using a Genki vocabulary deck to study for that class. I also wanted to go through the Core2k deck, so I did that as well. Since I needed to write for that class, I had my Genki deck have reading and writing/listening flashcards for each word. I then didn't merge Core2k and Genki because why would I. The note types aren't the same, the flashcard types aren't the same. The reasons I'm studying them aren't the same. Why would I just toss them all in under \"Vocabulary\"?\n\nAt this point I'm no longer taking classes, the Genki deck ended up fully completed, but I'm still doing reviews (~10 flashcards a day) until the cards are fully retired. I'm only studying new vocab (in Anki) from the Core6k deck. At this point I have effectively one vocabulary deck, and generally I would agree that this is a good thing, since you don't want to split yourself too much. That said, there are plenty of valid reasons that you might want 2 vocab decks. \n\nAnyway, on to your opinions on kanji decks. I mean this is straight up your personal experience. Here's my personal experience. I found that when I was learning vocab where I wasn't familiar with the kanji it took me a lot longer to learn the vocab compared to vocab where I knew the kanji. I ended up solving this issue with a kanji deck and the kanji unsuspend add on to unsuspend kanji that were used in words I was studying in my vocab deck. It's been very effective. \n\nI actually already had the kanji deck, since I had to learn to write Genki kanji for my class. I ended up unsuspending the new characters from vocab and learning to write them. While this is of course entirely unnecessary, part of the reason I wanted to learn Japanese in the first place is that I liked kanji and \u66f8\u9053 (looking at it, I still can't do calligraphy very well myself, but I'd like to learn some day). So learning to write aligns with my interests. It just happened to also make learning vocabulary much easier.\n\nSo my personal experience with kanji decks is about the opposite of yours.\n\nAlso you did do RTK, and then you go, well that doesn't count because I forgot 70% of it. It was the reading that helped me learn kanji. That's a pretty questionable conclusion. I've been studying Japanese for 10 years on and off. I've studied kanji, vocab, etc. And then taken a break for years and forgotten almost all of it, but I still learn it more quickly the second/third time around. You can't possibly know whether or not RTK made it easier for you to learn the kanji through reading native material because you'd have to have a clone of yourself who didn't do RTK to compare it to. Or ideally a properly controlled scientific study. \n\nTo be clear, all of what I'm saying is equally anecdotal and shouldn't be taken as fact either. I'm just saying that I find your assertions to be questionable.\n\nI do kind of agree about the grammar decks. Idk that does seem ill suited for flashcards. Apparently bunpro is pretty ok for grammar flashcards, but replicating bunpro in Anki seems to me like it would either be extremely tedious or almost impossible. So idk.\n\nAlso at the end I'm confused because you say sentence decks are bad because you'll memorize what the sentence means and then in the next paragraph go on to say that you recommend sentence mining and making sentence cards for your unknown vocabulary. Idk maybe there's some relevant distinction I'm missing between cards with sentences on the front and cards with sentences one of whose words is bolded on the front.\n\nSentence mining is kind of tricky if you're not at a computer. If you read paper materials or on a phone or ereader it's a bit tricky and tedious. That's actually one of the two main reasons why I haven't started sentence mining yet despite knowing that it'd give me more targeted vocabulary. I essentially never read on my computer, because if I'm at my computer I'm probably supposed to be working, and when I'm done working I don't really want to stare at the screen more.\n\nThe other reason is that mining sentences from books means I don't have native audio. Native audio for sentences is just extremely helpful for getting sentence level intonation practice.\n\nAnyway, this isn't intended to be a personal attack or anything. I just feel like your personal experiences don't match with mine, so I'm sharing my experiences to add an alternative perspective.", "created_utc": "1651072564.0", "edited": "False", "id": "i6ertl3", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_ucrctj", "parent_id": "t1_i6cwh7c", "score": "3", "subreddit": "LearnJapanese", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qyls"}, {"author": "jragonfyre", "body": "This is true of literally all of mathematics though.

Like I get the factual content about Japanese writing having hiragana, katakana, and kanji and Chinese having hanzi and pinyin, but I don't understand what point you are trying to make.\n\nI am skeptical that Japan would give up kanji. I can't decide whether that's more or less plausible than suggesting American English (or British, or Australian or whatever, pick a particular country) undergoes a spelling reform so that it's spelled phonetically. For one thing digital input actually makes it a lot easier to learn far more characters now than previously, since the obstacle before was learning to handwrite them. For another, in Korea everyone still has to study hanja in school for a variety of reasons, including the continuing existence of Chinese loans in modern Korean, which would apply to Japanese as well. Finally, I just don't think it's plausible that Japan would choose to cut itself off from its own culture and history given that there's no benefit to doing so.\n\nAlso I don't really see clear inefficiencies in kanji. What exactly is inefficient about them? The learning process? Well, maybe, but they pack information more efficiently, so there's a trade-off here. Besides, even if kanji were on the whole inefficient, is efficiency the only thing worth pursuing? Are art, culture and history not of some value?\n\nIdk, I'll admit that I personally very much like kanji. And I'm at the point now where I can write around 2k of them, so while I've got a ways to go, I've got a decent foundation in kanji at this point.

As for why a word is spelled a given way or not, that's usually a historical question and you'd have to look at what happened in the spelling reform which happened after ww2. The rule of thumb though is that words of Chinese origin always use \u304a\u3046. There aren't that many native Japanese words that use \u304a\u304a either, the common ones off the top of my head are \u304a\u304a and \u304a\u304a\u304d\u3044 meaning big, \u304a\u304a\u3044 meaning many, and \u3068\u304a\u3044 meaning distant.\n\nMy understanding is that a \u3046 after an \u304a vowel always elongates it in modern standard Japanese. I believe you may hear some people emphasize the \u3046 if they're speaking carefully (I suspect particularly with verb endings), but not when speaking normally. E.g.

In particular, you should probably use a traditional character method, since that'll give you kyuujitai and unsimplified characters for free.\n\nSee the Wikipedia article under shape based: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_input_methods_for_computers", "created_utc": "1647818388.0", "edited": "False", "id": "i1gqtjp", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_tivdhy", "parent_id": "t3_tivdhy", "score": "3", "subreddit": "LearnJapanese", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qyls"}, {"author": "jragonfyre", "body": "Alright, so first of all, I'm not an expert on Japanese names. I'm an intermediate learner.\n\n\nThe short answer is no, nanori are not the only readings used to create Japanese names. I believe nanori are basically readings that can be used in names that aren't already an on or kun reading of that character. \n\nE.g. \u56db\u30ce\u5bae(\u3057\u306e\u307f\u3084) is the family name of a character in a book I'm reading, which uses the onyomi and kunyomi of the characters in it.\n\nNext, you'd probably be well served by first reading the Wikipedia article on Japanese names: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_name\n\nSome comments though, Japanese family names are fairly set in some ways, and I don't think you can just make up new ones as a non-native, or at least non-expert and expect them to make sense as family names to native Japanese speakers. In particular, I believe most family names are read with kunyomi readings of their characters.\n\nSpecifically, I'd be somewhat shocked if anyone read \u4eba\u6765\u771f as nekotada (note that you're using the traditional version of \u6765, which I think is actually ok in names, but I'm not sure how common it is). It just doesn't read as a name to me, and I'd be very confused encountering it.\n\nAlso I don't think a Japanese person would give it the meaning you've given it, because you're thinking in English word order. I don't think this makes sense in Japanese, but maybe it might mean \"truth that people come to\" or \"person future-truth\" idk. In particular, I'm not sure the first version makes sense, since I don't know that you'd use \u6765\u308b for the English meaning of to arrive at/come to a truth. (Not to mention that I don't think you'd read a name as a full sentence anyway.)\n\nNow the other issue is the personal name \u6708\u70ba. The main thing is \u304c\u3063\u3073\u3044 isn't phonetically valid in traditional Japanese. I.e. you'll find small tsu in front of voiced consonants in loan words in modern Japanese, but it's not phonetically valid in native Japanese words, and even in loan words it's often pronounced by devoicing the following consonant, so this would probably become \u304c\u3063\u3074\u3044 I believe.\n\nAnyway, that's almost a side note, since (a) girls both traditionally and in the modern era were/are often given names in hiragana alone, so there'd be no need to find kanji that fit, and (b) these kanji even if pronounced the way you're intending probably don't sound like what I'd imagine the English name Gaby sounds like.\n\nFinally, on the topic of the personal name, as I understand it, among various immigrant communities in the US at least, it's common to do one of the following three things when naming your children. (1) give them a personal name in your native language and transliterate and approximate it for usage in English, (2) give your kid only an English personal name, (3) give your kid an English and native language personal name, with the native language personal name maybe being an official middle name or maybe just being a name used at home that isn't on personal documents. I don't usually hear of people being given an English name and then choosing a native language name to approximate that. Maybe it happens, but at least in my personal experience, it's extremely uncommon.\n\nThe last comment I have overall is on reading both names together as one sentence. This just isn't done. At least in my (admittedly limited) knowledge, I don't think this is common at all. The family name and personal name are pretty independent, and the family name's meaning isn't usually that important. (Well, in real life anyway, it can be used in fiction to suggest character traits perhaps.) The personal name is much more important, because that's what's unique to the individual.

Generally speaking what you've read about the usage of katakana, hiragana, and kanji is accurate, but it's not the full story. \n\nJapanese verbs and adjectives need to inflect, so most Japanese verbs and adjectives are written with kanji that indicate the meaning of the verb followed by hiragana which give the inflection of the verb. \n\nSo \u6b69\u304f(\u3042\u308b.\u304f=aru.ku) is a verb meaning to walk, with the first symbol being a kanji with that meaning and the second symbol being a hiragana pronounced \"ku\" that gives the inflection. When you conjugate it, e.g. as \u6b69\u3044\u305f(aru.ita) the following hiragana change to mark the conjugation. \n\nThe story with katakana is more interesting. Katakana are definitely used for modern loan words. However, they're also used sort of as a stylistic choice. In particular, sometimes they mark a particular slangy or colloquial meaning. So the example I gave is \u30e2\u30c6\u308b(moteru), which is also a verb. The first two characters are the stem of the verb in katakana, pronounced \"mote\", and the last character is again hiragana like in the kanji example to mark the inflection. This verb can also be written in kanji as \u6301\u3066\u308b where it means to be able to possess, as well as a secondary meaning of to be popular (generally romantically). When the stem is written with katakana rather than the kanji, it specifically selects this secondary meaning.\n\nKatakana stems on verbs can also be found on verb loan words (which are generally rare, but do exist), like \u30b0\u30b0\u308b (gugu.ru) meaning to google.\n\nFinally the last example I gave is very uncommon, and the way it's written is not the usual way of writing this word, but it's not technically incorrect (at least my dictionary lists it as one possible writing). It's usually written all in katakana as \u30ab\u30e9\u30aa\u30b1(karaoke), but it's a compound of a native japanese word usually written with kanji, \u7a7a(\u304b\u3089, kara) meaning empty and an English loan word, \u30aa\u30fc\u30b1\u30b9\u30c8\u30e9(o-kesutora), meaning orchestra, so it can be written as \u7a7a\u30aa\u30b1 as well.", "created_utc": "1644964832.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hx3ifgx", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_ssgqp1", "parent_id": "t1_hx2jsgt", "score": "2", "subreddit": "thisorthatlanguage", "subreddit_id": "t5_4inj8f"}, {"author": "jragonfyre", "body": "Except they're not used for different types of words.

Are examples of single words containing combinations of kanji and hiragana, hiragana and katakana and katakana and kanji respectively.\n\nMy point is that framing it as if Japanese has three writing systems and that that's why it's hard to learn is unnecessarily discouraging to beginners. The reason it's hard to learn to read and write is kanji, not the \"three writing systems.\" I think beginners can come away with the idea that Japanese writing is needlessly complex and confusing, when in reality it's fairly straightforward.

I think it's best to say that the purpose of okurigana is primarily to allow for conjugation, with distinguishing readings being a secondary concern. There are some ambiguous words, and in those cases context usually distinguishes the reading.\n\nFor example \u5165\u308b can be read as \u3044\u308b or \u306f\u3044\u308b, but it's really only \u3044\u308b in certain contexts like \u6c17\u306b\u5165\u308b.\n\nAnyway, the primary rules for verbs are the following\n\n1) \uff15\u6bb5 (godan/5-step/u-verbs/group-1) have only the last kana of the dictionary form as okurigana and \uff11\u6bb5 (ichidan/1-step/ru-verbs/iru-eru-verbs/group-2) have the last two kana of the dictionary form as okurigana unless the verb is only two kana in total, in which case only the last kana is okurigana. \n\nE.g. \u5165\u308b(\u306f\u3044\u308b), \u8aad\u3080(\u3088\u3080), and \u5207\u308b(\u304d\u308b), are godan, whereas \u5165\u308c\u308b(\u3044\u308c\u308b), \u98df\u3079\u308b(\u305f\u3079\u308b), and \u7740\u308b(\u304d\u308b) are ichidan.\n\n2) if the verb is part of a transitive/intransitive pair with a common root, then the common part is treated as the reading for the kanji, and the remainder will be written in okurigana for both verbs. This takes precedence over rule 1.\n\nE.g. \u9589\u3081\u308b and \u9589\u307e\u308b, or \u66f2\u3052\u308b and \u66f2\u304c\u308b\n\nThere are still exceptions to these rules, but these cover the most common cases. Usually the exceptions are to disambiguate readings.\n\nThere are also rules for adjectives (by which I only mean \u3044-adjectives),\n\n1) the default is to have just \u3044 as okurigana unless the adjective ends in \u3057\u3044, in which case the default will be to have the \u3057\u3044 as okurigana\n\n2) similar to above, if there is an adjective with a related verb, the common part will be treated as the reading of the kanji and the remainder will be okurigana. \n\nE.g. \u6696\u3081\u308b(\u3042\u305f\u305f\u3081\u308b) and \u6696\u304b\u3044(\u3042\u305f\u305f\u304b\u3044)\n\nThen there are again exceptions for disambiguation purposes here as well.", "created_utc": "1644430055.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hw963bl", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_snx99z", "parent_id": "t1_hw5h800", "score": "1", "subreddit": "japanese", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qmnp"}, {"author": "jragonfyre", "body": "Congrats!

I've been studying fairly consistently, mostly on my own, since then, and I've finally gotten to a solid intermediate level. In particular, I've learned kanji properly this time around. I'm coming up on around 2,000 kanji, and at this point there are very few kanji I don't recognize (as a percentage of kanji in a given text), particularly if you exclude names. I finally feel like reading is doable, and I'm more limited by my vocabulary than my kanji knowledge. (Although my reading speed feels painfully slow, even when I know all the words.)\n\nFinally, I started learning Mandarin just under 6 months ago. It's been a really exciting journey. It's the first time I've started learning a language on my own where I feel like I sort of know what I'm doing. I've made more progress than I had thought possible, although it comes at the cost of reducing the speed of my Japanese progress. I feel like I've reached an upper beginner level and am working towards a lower intermediate level now. \n\nThere have been some interesting cross over benefits between Japanese and Chinese. For one thing, there are tons of cognates. The cognates don't usually sound the same, but that's almost more helpful, since it makes it very had to get them confused. Also even if a word isn't a cognate, I generally have an intuitive sense of what a huge chunk of common characters mean, so I find it relatively easy to predict, or at least remember what a new word means. For another thing characters common in one language can be less common in the other, which means that I get a better intuitive sense of the meaning of some less common characters more easily. \n\nFinally I think there is some crossover benefit between learning pitch accent in Japanese and learning tones in Mandarin. I would say I had very little difficulty learning to hear and pronounce tones in Mandarin other than it took a while to get the tone change rules ingrained in my head. This is in contrast to my experience initially with pitch accent in Japanese, where I was constantly getting corrected by my professors and I couldn't hear the distinction. Ultimately I did learn to hear pitch accent through actively listening for it in audio flashcards, but it was very challenging.\n\nInterestingly enough, the biggest cause of cross language confusion for me at this point has been between Japanese and Spanish. I suspect it's because their phonetic systems are very similar, so words from one language mostly sound like they would fit in the other language. (Particularly Japanese words sound ok in Spanish.) At this point, having focused on Japanese for many years, and not having studied Spanish for a while, my Japanese is fine, but if I try to speak Spanish, sometimes Japanese words come out.\n\nRecently, I've been filled with a desire to pick up Spanish again and dust it off and learn to read at a high level again and learn to speak properly. I'm not sure when that'll happen. It's going to have to wait at least until my Mandarin is at a solid intermediate level, and ideally until my Japanese reaches an advanced level of comprehension.

That said I've never actually tried reading the book.\n\nHere's my experience.\n\nSomebody explained to me the core concept of creating mnemonics involving keywords to use for remembering the characters. So I downloaded an RTK Anki deck, and started using it. I probably got a few hundred characters in before deciding this isn't really useful to me. \n\nProblems imo\n\n1. You see relatively infrequent characters early on. These include components that are rare on their own, but common as components, which I actually think is helpful, so that was fine, but the other infrequent characters are characters that use only a few common components, aren't themselves components of common characters, and are rare. These are less useful.\n2. No motivation. Even for relatively common characters, if I don't know any words using them, it's very unmotivated for me. Like why should I learn this character if I don't have a need for it?\n3. Unique keywords aren't ideal. The keywords aren't supposed to capture the meaning of the character. Usually they're related in some way, but really they're mnemonic devices. This means that you're not really learning the meaning of the characters, and some of the keywords are inaccurate if you assume that they represent the meaning. Also characters with similar meanings get different but similar keywords which can be confusing. Also some of the keywords are just not common English words, like \"decameron\" in particular.\n\nWhat I ended up/am still doing.\n\nI'm still using mnemonics to remember kanji by breaking them into components. That's a very useful idea. Here's what I've changed.\n\n1. I learn characters in words I'm learning. I've learned every character that occurs in vocab cards in my Anki deck that I've seen so far. I use an add-on called Kanji unsuspender for this.\n2. I also learn most characters that show up as components in a character I'm trying to learn even if they're uncommon.\n3. Instead of keywords, I'm more flexible in my mnemonics. I create a sentence that uses words that I personally associate to the meanings of the components.\n4. I also find it very helpful to remember which component of the character is phonetic if there is one (there usually is). But I don't test myself on it. It makes it a lot easier to get an intuitive sense of \u97f3\u8aad\u307f if you get a feel for common phonetic components.

As another commenter mentioned, the definitive resources on this will probably be in Japanese.\n2. For free resources, just use Wikipedia's Japanese phonology page.

In particular for \u3057 you basically described the same consonant twice.\n4. For paid resources you might look into Dogen's pronunciation series. It's become somewhat famous for being one of few decent pitch accent resources that's in English, but it's not limited to pitch accent. It has videos on the consonants and vowels.\n5. As you mentioned there is some variability among native speakers. There are some sounds it's important to get right to minimize confusion, and there are others that aren't as important, because they vary in the existing speaker population to begin with.\n6. The rule for \u3093 is fairly straightforward. Before a consonant it's the nasal pronounced at the location of the following consonant. (In particular, this causes a following fricative to turn into a stop, usually a voiced one.) Between vowels it's pronounced as a nasalized vowel. It also causes the preceding vowel to be nasalized.

The thing that I do agree with those people on though is that even if you do individual kanji study it should be in the context of vocabulary words you are either presently learning or are already familiar with.\n\nAnyway, I don't know where you're at in vocabulary, but most people as beginners tend to know far more vocabulary than kanji, so you almost certainly have more kanji to learn in the vocabulary you know then you can do in one sitting, so you still need a way to order the kanji that you're learning beyond just \"in the order that you learn vocabulary.\"\n\nFor this I'll just say it actually doesn't matter much, just pick a sensible order and stick to it. \n\nYes, the Jouyou/Kanken, JLPT and frequency order don't match. But they're actually fairly close.\n\nThe Jouyou/Kanken kanji can be broken up further into categories:\n\nElementary grades 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 (corresponding to Kanken levels 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, and 5 respectively) (approximately 1000 kanji)\n\nThese are also called the \u6559\u80b2(kyouiku=education) kanji.\n\nThe middle school/high school kanji (all the rest of the Jouyou kanji) correspond to Kanken levels 4, 3, pre-2/semi-2 (\u6e962), 2 (with 2 being the 2010 addition of 196 characters to the Jouyou Kanji)\n\nLevels 3 and 4 together are about 600 more kanji and levels pre-2 and 2 are about another 500 on top of that.\n\nThen there are the \"personal name\" characters or \u4eba\u540d\u7528 (jinmeiyou) kanji. These form level \u6e961 or pre-1 of the kanken (more or less, it's not exactly a perfect correspondence at this level). (There are 848 on the kanken and 863 jinmeiyou characters.)\n\nAlright, so how do these compare to the JLPT?\n\nWell first of all, I don't think there are official lists of vocabulary or kanji for the current version of the JLPT, but here are some estimates from the web.\n\nN5: ~100-120\n\nN4: ~300\n\nN3: ~650\n\nN2: ~1000-1150\n\nN1: ~2000-2350\n\nAlso while neither set of exams/jouyou goes purely by frequency order for kanji knowledge, they both follow it roughly. \n\nAs a result we can form a fairly rough correspondence between Jouyou/Kanken levels and JLPT levels. It won't be exact, but it'll be fairly close.\n\nN5: in between Jouyou grade 1 and 2\n\nN4: in between Jouyou grade 2 and 3\n\nN3: pretty close to Jouyou grade 4\n\nN2: pretty close to the kyouiku kanji = Jouyou grade 6\n\nN1: you should probably have close to full Jouyou knowledge and know a few common non-Jouyou characters.\n\nThe main differences will be that the Jouyou order will focus on conceptually simpler characters that children can understand but may not be as relevant for adult learners, whereas the JLPT will cover conceptually more complicated characters that are more relevant to adult learners.

On the other hand, it's harder to find premade decks for 1 and 2, but if you make your own they'll be more targeted towards the grammar points you care about.\n\nOf course the downside of all of this is that the sentences are the same every time you see a flashcard, so you need quite a few flashcards for each grammar point (particularly for the Cloze deletion ones, where the rest of the Chinese sentence might give you too much of a memory assistance to mean you're actually memorizing the grammar point).\n\nEdit: I should add that I focus on type 3, I have an HSK deck with sentences and native audio that I found somewhere on Reddit a few months ago. It would be good to train production too, since I have people I want to talk to in Mandarin irl, but I'm focusing on comprehension right now, since it's easier to find decks for comprehension practice and it won't matter what I can say if I can't understand what is said back to me.", "created_utc": "1638464572.0", "edited": "1638464797.0", "id": "hmya8l6", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_r77wju", "parent_id": "t1_hmy6vow", "score": "11", "subreddit": "ChineseLanguage", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qyz1"}, {"author": "jragonfyre", "body": "If you're N3 you'll want an easier light novel, like GJ\u90e8 or \u9b54\u5973\u306e\u5b85\u6025\u4fbf.

(There are some further subtleties (e.g. contrast), but these are the fundamental uses.) \n\nIn general, particles in Japanese are analogous to prepositions in English (as well as cases in German), in that they mark the relationship between a noun phrase and the rest of the predicate. Certain predicates require certain slots to be filled (by noun phrases marked with the appropriate particles), but if the phrase that should fill the slot is clear from context, then it can be omitted.\nFor example, a transitive verb is a verb that requires a subject (marked by \u304c) and an object (marked by \u3092).", "created_utc": "1638312971.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hmq1xvl", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_r5wlak", "parent_id": "t3_r5wlak", "score": "32", "subreddit": "LearnJapanese", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qyls"}, {"author": "jragonfyre", "body": "It doesn't matter for reading typed material, of course, or for writing on a computer, but if you want to learn to handwrite, following the correct stroke order will affect how your character flows and how legible it is to other people.

Not all Latinos are Spanish speakers. Latino (in North American English) refers to people of Latin American origin or descent. In particular this includes monolingual English speakers of Latin American heritage, Portuguese speakers from Brazil, French speakers from French Guiana, and speakers of indigenous languages from Latin America. The term for people from specifically Spanish speaking countries is \"Hispanic.\" In particular, I want to push back on your claim that the word is intended for Spanish speakers.\n\n2. Latinx is not supposed to be a Spanish word. The people who support the term are supporting it as an English word. Latino is itself an English loan word from Spanish. However, due to the large number of Spanish speakers in North America, it hasn't fully separated from Spanish and become a purely English word. However, even if Latino is gender neutral in Spanish, it's important to keep in mind that it may not be in English, because the Spanish and English words are distinct. In particular, English has also borrowed Latina, and in English we don't tend to categorize words into male+gender neutral or female, instead English words tend to be either male, female or neutral. \n\nTake for example loans from French like masseur and masseuse. These are fairly gendered as male and female words in English regardless of the fact that French uses the masculine for gender neutral like Spanish does. On the other hand, chauffeur retains its gender-neutral character and loses its masculine character in English, probably as a result of the feminine chauffeuse being so uncommon in English.\n\nThis analogy is intended to support my point that despite the usage in Spanish, Latino and Latina are generally seen as gendered in English, necessitating some form of gender-neutral English word. Some people have opted for just using Latino, and others have opted for Latinx, and others have borrowed gender-neutral versions from Spanish gender-neutral language movements like Latine and Latin.\n\nThe point here is that Latinx doesn't have to be a Spanish word, nor do I believe that most of its advocates intend it to be. It's a perfectly reasonable English word. As a result, I don't see it disrespecting the Spanish language unless people try to force it back into Spanish. (Which some people may do, but I definitely don't think they're anywhere near the majority of people using the word.)\n\nTo summarize, I think you ought to reconceptualize Latinx as an English word that is a modification of a loan from Spanish rather than one intended to be a Spanish one, and additionally it's worth keeping in mind that it doesn't just refer to Spanish speakers.\n\nAnyway these are just the points where I think you could change your view.

Ultimately you ought to make those decisions yourself.\n\nFor context on where I'm coming from, I'm currently studying Japanese and Mandarin with a largely input focused approach in personal time as a hobby.\n\nAnyway, in lieu of concrete advice, I'll list some factors that might influence what you should do.\n\n1. Most importantly, what are you long term goals with respect to both languages. Do you want to prioritize one language over the other long term? What levels are you trying to get them to?\n\n2. How much time do you have? Ideally use a time tracking app to measure the time you have available for language learning. How do you want to break that down between your two languages? Are you finding that you don't have enough time available? Can you creatively find time elsewhere?\n\n3. What is your current level in Korean? I don't mean what is your current level in some particular measuring system. Rather I mean that certain pieces of input become comprehensible at certain levels, and you may be focusing on primarily one kind of input in your more advanced language which you cannot do in your less advanced language, and as a result they don't present as much of a time conflict. For example, I can listen to podcasts in Japanese while doing chores, but I can't do that in Mandarin.\n\n4. How much time do you need to spend on Japanese to pass your Japanese class? This is hard to predict before taking the class. Honestly though two semesters is not likely to get to a particularly high level, and you will likely find it relatively easy. Particularly because you have already learned a decent amount of Korean, which shares a lot of similarities with Japanese.\n\n5. Finally, this is specific to you and ties in to the last point. Japanese and Korean share a lot of similarities. If your Korean is not sufficiently advanced you may find yourself getting interference between the two. On the other hand, this is balanced by the assistance that knowing some Korean will give you when learning Japanese. To minimize interference it's probably best to keep Japanese and Korean separate in some way while learning.

After all, this is also something that kids learning to read their native language go through (more or less). At least in English, my native language, you start by slowly and painfully sounding out the words and as a native speaker you use your knowledge of the language to try to figure out which word is represented by those letters. Eventually with practice your brain just learns which symbols mean what and how they sound and can even guess at how to pronounce words that it's never heard said.\n\nThat said, it's a bit of a frustrating process to go through as an adult, where we're so used to reading fluently in one language already. Here I can only offer my experience.\n\nI'm not a heritage speaker of any language, and my Chinese is not yet good enough to be applicable, but I am an intermediate Japanese learner and I can read fairly well when the vocabulary is familiar to me (though still much slower than my native language). So my experience may not translate perfectly, but hopefully it can help. I also know a heritage speaker who is going through the same process of learning to read Chinese.\n\nThe main thing you need to do to turn conscious knowledge of characters into instinctive unconscious knowledge is to read. But that doesn't necessarily mean forcing your way through texts that are way above your reading level. In fact, it's probably better to focus on texts where you know all the characters and most of the words. In Mandarin there are fortunately a lot of graded readers available, which might be a good option for this purpose. \n\nAnother option (a little less orthodox perhaps) might be to find a deck of sentence cards with audio. Then set them up to go from the written sentence on the front to the audio on the back (as a heritage speaker, probably best to avoid having any English on there). I actually have no idea how well this would work for a heritage speaker, but it has personally helped me as a learner with my Japanese reading and now my Chinese reading.\n\nAlso, maybe it's weirder as a heritage speaker, but it's totally fine if you need to try to translate to English to read.

Learning Chinese will help with learning Japanese. \n\nNow let me qualify that.\n\nIf you do not have to take some language for some reason, then don't take Chinese if you're only interested in Japanese. It will not give you that much assistance, particularly before you reach a solid intermediate level. That said, I can imagine many reasons you might have to take some language. E.g. because your school requires it, or because you need to take a language for college applications or major requirements or something else (idk what school level or where in the world you are).\n\nKnowing one language does help when learning the other though. I'll be speaking from my experience starting studying Mandarin while at an intermediate level in Japanese.\n\nBenefits:\n\n1. Learning tones in Mandarin should help with getting an awareness of Japanese pitch accent and correctly hearing and reproducing it. Conversely, I would expect pitch accent listening practice to aid in correctly hearing and reproducing tones in Mandarin. \n2. an understanding of how hanzi/kanji work, are constructed, phonetic components, stroke order (mostly), as well as what works for you when learning to read/write characters is largely the same between languages\n3. there are many many cognate words in the two languages due to Japanese borrowings of Chinese words\n4. There are also a lot of similarities between the modern Mandarin readings of characters and the onyomi of Japanese characters, which does make learning the readings easier (going either way)\n5. Random side benefit, Japanese and Chinese share a set if consonants that don't exist in English. In pinyin the set is xi, qi, ji, and in Japanese the corresponding set is \u3057, \u3061, \u3058. The first sound in each set are extremely similar. The next two are very close (modulo strength of aspiration), and the last two are fairly similar, except that the Chinese consonant is unvoiced and unaspirated, and the Japanese one is voiced.\n\nMajor cons and differences to be aware of:\n\n1. This is a huge reason why there's not as much benefit for beginners. The common characters differ between the two languages a lot. Characters for I in Japanese: \u79c1, \u50d5, \u4ffa. The main character for I in Chinese: \u6211 (which is still used in Japanese, but much more rarely). Another example: eat \u98df vs \u5403, drink \u98f2 vs \u559d. \n2. False friends. There are definitely characters whose meaning has shifted in one language or the other, as well as compound words that have the same characters but mean completely different things. I would say this is relatively minor compared to the benefits of all the cognates though.\n3. Simplified, Traditional, and Shinjitai (Japanese simplified) characters can all differ or any two can agree while the third differs. A lot of the time this is fairly minor, particularly if you discount characters that only differ by predictable component simplification like \u996d and \u98ef, \u9a6c and \u99ac, \u9e1f and \u9ce5, \u8bed and \u8a9e etc. But even so, it can still get kind of tricky.\n4. This is only really an issue for people who don't care about learning Chinese, but do care about Japanese and beginners who don't know a lot of characters yet. Chinese uses more characters than Japanese does, and a lot of characters that Chinese uses that Japanese doesn't are very common. This is because Chinese has no phonetic script, so loan words are either translated by meaning or given a phonetic transliteration with Chinese characters. E.g. coffee \u5496\u5561 (ka1fei1), compared to \u30b3\u30fc\u30d2\u30fc (which is old enough to have characters in Japanese as well, but I think they're extremely rare: \u73c8\u7432). Anyway, as a result, if you start learning Chinese, you will learn a lot of characters that aren't even used in (modern) Japanese, which is wasted effort if you don't care about Chinese.", "created_utc": "1636406193.0", "edited": "1636406375.0", "id": "hjups4p", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_qpgwii", "parent_id": "t3_qpgwii", "score": "3", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "jragonfyre", "body": "Akebi is still not quite as good as pleco, but by far the best (Japanese-English) dictionary app that I've used (on Android).", "created_utc": "1636403435.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hjuivh8", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_qpgwii", "parent_id": "t1_hjuawli", "score": "2", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "jragonfyre", "body": "Ok when did you start this flashcard regime?

E.g. such and such character is water radical + some number of strokes (or some other similar scheme). That way it's easy to lookup characters in a sensible order in a paper dictionary. This is largely unnecessary in the modern era. Also what a radical is depends to some extent on the dictionary (don't quote me on this one, maybe there was a standard agreed upon at some point).\n\nOn the other hand, characters can be broken into components, these components are sometimes called radicals, which leads to confusion and people talking past each other. It is not uncommon (among foreign learners of hanzi) to give common components a name (sometimes based on the meaning of that component, and sometimes based on its appearance) **regardless of the true etymology of the character/origin of that component** and use those names to form mnemonics to remember characters, particularly how to write characters. \n\nThis can be a useful and effective tool to remember characters. But it's important to remember that these mnemonics are not likely to be etymologically sound a lot of the time, and that's ok. The true etymology isn't the point of the mnemonics. The goal is to remember the character, not anything else. And typically this is more necessary for learning to handwrite, not for reading, because it's easier to learn to recognize characters than to produce them.\n\nIn particular, you can change this system however you want to work for you. It doesn't matter what the \"real\" meaning of a component of a character is. Maybe that component is an obscure archaic character, or maybe it's actual meaning is difficult to make mnemonics with, or maybe that component has no meaning. Give the components names that are helpful to you in making mnemonics. Give them multiple names if it's helpful. \n\nOr don't do this to memorize hanzi. It's just one strategy, probably more popular among Japanese learners, and often misused and misunderstood. It's primary value is in learning to handwrite in my opinion.\n\nHowever, there is one useful thing to know about the components of Chinese characters. Most characters in Chinese are phonosemantic compounds, meaning they have two pieces. One component, the meaning component, suggests the meaning category of the character, like water, earth, heart, etc. These also tend to be radicals in the dictionary sense (though certainly not always).

I personally have found it helpful to make mnemonic sentences which tie the semantic component to the phonetic component and a meaning for the character. It's very helpful for remembering how to write characters. It's also important to be okay with the mnemonics you create having no etymological validity.

But on the other hand, if those young cards aren't useful to you, then maybe it's better to just let them go. Don't waste your time reviewing words you don't care about.\n\nIf you want to see how quickly, you can use the Anki Simulator add on to forecast reviews. (It's not perfect if you have other add-ons to adjust ease or whatnot, but even then it's surprisingly accurate)\n\nAs for writing kanji, I would think about whether handwriting is worth it to you. That's always something you can come back to later as well. \n\nI am currently learning to handwrite kanji. I'm at an intermediate level in Japanese (probably quite a bit less vocab than you, not sure precisely how much though, because I've acquired a fair bit of vocab through reading). I decided to learn to handwrite because I handwrite probably an hour or more each day in my native language, since I'm a math grad student, so I find handwriting personally valuable. In addition, I'm also learning to handwrite because part of what drew me to Japanese originally was the kanji. I think kanji are beautiful, and I enjoy learning to write them.\n\nThat said, I will say it takes a lot of time to learn to write kanji. I never did RRTK, so perhaps having existing mnemonics will speed up the process, but I spend 20-30min a day doing handwriting SRS cards, doing about 3 new kanji a day. The new characters come from newer vocab that I'm less familiar with, which makes them harder to remember I suppose, compared to characters coming from very familiar vocab you've seen in reading hundreds of times. \n\nIt's a huge time commitment. I'd estimate I do about 14 hours of study per 100 new kanji (that includes reviews of old kanji). That said it probably takes less study per character for kanji in the most common 1000 that you see all the time. I'm currently learning characters in the 1500-2000 frequency range (learning them in frequency order based on my reading material though).\n\nAs I said, I feel very strongly about learning to handwrite personally, but I wouldn't really recommend learning more than 500-1000 kanji unless you also feel very strongly about it.\n\nSo in summary my advice for handwriting is the following:\n\n1. Almost everyone should probably learn to write 200-300 basic kanji and get a sense of stroke order so that you can at least copy down typed out characters\n2. If you're not super committed to learning to handwrite, but you do like handwriting, then until you get to an advanced level, it's probably not worth the time commitment to go beyond 500-1000 characters.\n3. If you are super committed to learning to handwrite (let's say that means roughly the Jouyou kanji+some), then just be aware of the time commitment it represents, take it slowly (e.g. 3 new characters a day), and don't let it take over your learning time.", "created_utc": "1635956670.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hj5z45l", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_qkyvyx", "parent_id": "t3_qkyvyx", "score": "2", "subreddit": "LearnJapanese", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qyls"}, {"author": "jragonfyre", "body": "Ah I see.

Meshclass in particular speaks very clearly. If that's too difficult, yeah look for N5/N4 level listening material.\n\nAs for gamifying reading, that's actually a great point. One thing you can do is track your vocab lookups. My dictionary for example (Akebi app on Android) lets me make word lists, so I save a list of words from each chapter I read. Then at the end of the chapter I enter the page count and lookup count into a spreadsheet to track my average lookups per page over time. I also highlight the vocab I looked up as I go, and make a note of the definition (I use an epub reader for reading on mobile), so I can easily double check words I looked up recently without going back to the dictionary.

It's definitely a good idea to try to maintain it as best as possible. That said, relearning things never takes as long as learning them did.\n\nAnyway, for your specific situation, I started learning Mandarin recently, but I am still primarily focusing on Japanese, so my situation is a bit different, but I think I can give a bit of insight.\n\nThe first thing to point out is that learning Mandarin is synergistic with learning Japanese in a number of ways, so let's start with the similarities. Firstly of course is kanji/hanzi. While you may forget readings of kanji if you don't do reading practice for Japanese, your knowledge of meanings of Chinese characters will probably go up (at least once you get past the primarily pinyin and tones part of the Mandarin course). Second, Japanese has piles of loanwords from Chinese, some of which you will pick up from learning Mandarin, again meaning only, unless you keep up Japanese reading.\n\nNow for the things you won't get exposure to while learning Chinese, hiragana, katakana, native Japanese words, and Japanese grammar.\n\nIf you can read hiragana fluently now, you almost certainly will not forget it in 2 years even without exposure. At least in my experience. You might get a bit slower, but it'll come back quickly. For katakana, you probably can't read it fluently, unless you've done katakana reading practice, since most learners can't. You will probably forget some katakana if you don't practice it.\n\nFor native Japanese words and grammar, my recommendation is that you try to maintain exposure to Japanese content that is at your level like graded readers or easy Japanese podcasts and YouTube channels.\n\nIt's worth pointing out though that acquired grammar will probably not be forgotten, though any grammar that you've memorized but not yet acquired probably will be forgotten over the course of 2 years. By acquired grammar I mean the kind of grammar that your brain automatically parses and produces with no conscious thought. Maybe something like turning a verb into it's masu form is like this for you.

Their strategy for learning characters was based on my method for learning characters, but modified to take into account that they already know lots of words. Here's that strategy:\n\nUse SRS (spaced repetition system) flashcards. I like Anki because it's highly configurable. Also Anki has decks other people have made you can download for free.\n\nIn particular, there is a 3,000 most common Hanzi Deck. If you use Anki, I recommend downloading this and configuring it.\n\nAs for how to configure the deck, that depends on whether you are only learning to read or also want to learn to write (by hand).\n\nFor learning to handwrite, set up the flashcards so that on the front there is the english meaning and pronunciation, and on the back you have the stroke order (for whichever form you're learning, simplified, traditional, or both) as well as the character in both simplified and traditional form in various fonts (ideally one font for each of Kaiti, Heiti, Songti, Xingti). \n\nReview is done by looking at the front, trying to write the character on paper, flipping the card and checking to see if you wrote it with essentially the correct stroke order.\n\nFor reading only, swap the fronts and backs of the cards above, and probably don't even bother putting the stroke order diagrams on the cards.\n\nNow so far this doesn't take into account your existing knowledge of Chinese. For this, create a new field in your deck to store Chinese words that you already know that contain the character. Then when you encounter a new character in the flashcard deck that you don't already know, look it up in Pleco, and put a few of the most common words that come up that you know as spoken words into the field. If you're trying to learn to write, replace the target character with pinyin or zhuyin. If some of the words contain characters you don't already know, you can add pinyin/zhuyin hints to those as well, but leave the characters in place. Ideally choose at least one word for each reading of the character.\n\nNow have this field show up on the front of the card as you review (for handwriting), it can go either on the front or back for reading. Either way make sure you read this field every time you do the flashcard. The point is to associate the character with words you already know in Chinese.\n\nAnyway, I think that about wraps it up.\n\nOh and yeah, the other piece of the puzzle is reading more. Once you've learned enough characters that you're getting to the point that the characters you've learned are more or less a match for the Chinese words you know, the way to further expand your vocabulary and character knowledge is to read. This is true in any language. I suspect as a native speaker, you should be able to pick up vocabulary quickly through reading with only a few lookups here and there once your character knowledge is on par with your spoken language ability, but if that's not the case, or you want to boost your retention ability, you can put new words you encounter into flashcards as well. I think pleco is probably super convenient for this purpose, but Anki also works.\n\nEdit:\n\nPS1: \nOh and I forgot to mention, use mnemonics when studying characters. Break the character into meaningful components and create a little story about why the character has the meaning it does based on its components. It doesn't matter if it's etymologically correct or not, the point is mnemonics vastly improve your retention rate for characters\n\nPS2:\nIn my opinion learning to write doesn't take significantly longer than learning to read, because handwriting characters really boosts my retention ability and my ability to visualize the character. It helps with disambiguating similar looking characters as well. But I do admit that it probably does take more time, and it certainly consumes more dedicated time, in the sense that reading only flashcards can be done anywhere, even while walking or on public transit, but writing flashcards require you to sit down and handwrite.

I'm not an expert on any of this, so I may be oversimplifying, taking stuff out of context, or just wrong, but these are some of what I've gathered:\n\n\n1) A lot of modern transitive/intransitive pairs developed out of causative and passive forms of a base verb that's no longer used. And more generally, a lot of Japanese verbs that end in \u3042\u3059/\u3042\u305b\u308b are like this.\n\n\n2) As I understand it, these were originally like the \u305f\u3044-form, namely verb stem + \u305f/\u3066, but the sounds shifted into the modern ones through euphonic change. So (modulo other sound changes) it would've been more like \u305d\u305d\u304e\u305f originally, which makes it more clear how we got to the modern form, I think.\n\n\n3) I don't really know what you're talking about for 3, maybe \u306e vs \u3053\u3068 vs \u3082\u306e vs verb stem? Anyway I agree this is a confusing point if that's what you're talking about.\n\n\n4) For this one, I think the important thing to realize here that clears up 90% of what you're talking about is that \u3042\u3059 and \u3042\u305b\u308b are both valid ways to form the causative (for \u4e94\u6bb5 verbs). Thus we have two versions of the causative-passive \u3042\u3055\u308c\u308b and \u3042\u305b\u3089\u308c\u308b, and the shorter one is generally preferred.\n\nIn particular, \u307e\u304b\u3059 and \u307e\u304b\u305b\u308b almost certainly have the same root \"mak\" regardless of whether that by itself is a verb in modern Japanese. \n\nAlso, I suspect the prohibition on something like \u3060\u3055\u3059 and related forms is because they're already causative. I'd like to see some more convincing evidence that it's because of the \u3055\u3055 sequence. Hm I guess you could probably say \u3060\u3055\u305b\u308b \"make take/put out,\" but then the issue is using \u3042\u3059 twice in a row to form causative really.\n\nAlso the two pairs at the end of (4) both stem from the alternative ways to form the causative. They aren't irregular.\n\n\nAnyway very interesting post. Just responding with my thoughts and the knowledge that I currently have about these things. No criticism intended here, and I agree that all of these things are confusing when you first encounter them (hence why I've looked into them).", "created_utc": "1633276622.0", "edited": "1633276805.0", "id": "hf8l0rp", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_pzkz55", "parent_id": "t1_hf20pfi", "score": "1", "subreddit": "LearnJapanese", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qyls"}, {"author": "jragonfyre", "body": "I took the all-in-one kanji deck from ankiweb modified it so that the cards go from English + readings on the front to stroke order, a bunch of different fonts of the kanji, and example vocab on the back.\n\nThe goal of a card is just to correctly write the kanji (on paper) and ideally remember a piece of vocab I know it in. \n\nI've gone through around 1600 kanji at this point, and it's been extremely helpful.\n\nI also set up my Genki vocab deck to go from audio to the written form and I handwrite the words when they come up.

Here are some things you might want to look for.\n\n1) As someone else mentioned, it's good to have a rough idea of the stroke order rules. They don't tell you the stroke order for every character, but they'll get you closer. After a certain amount of practice you won't need to think about them consciously, they'll be ingrained in you, and you'll look at a character and have a pretty good guess at it's stroke order.\n\n2) There should be online character worksheet generators that'll make character worksheets (with stroke order diagrams) for you. Here's the top result on Google for one of these: http://chineseworksheetgenerator.org/\n\n3) Learn the stroke orders of the common components/radicals in hanzi. The stroke orders of components are basically fixed, so learning the stroke orders of the components means you just have to learn which order the components are written in for a given character, which is usually pretty easy based on the stroke order rules from 1). You should also be able to find worksheets for the components online.\n\n4) Most major textbook series should also offer character workbooks to go with their lower level textbooks that will basically include worksheets like those I'm talking about in 2 and 3 if you don't want to generate/find them yourself, although these will cost money.\n\n5) Finally a completely different approach. Use Anki. If you're not familiar, Anki is flashcard software, and there are premade decks of flashcards freely downloadable online. One of these decks is called something like 3000 most common hanzi, and the flashcards include stroke order diagrams (for at least the simplified characters, but maybe traditional as well).

Namely at what point is abortion the killing of a human being, and at what point is it morally wrong to kill that human being? These can be two separate points in time. \n\n2) This is the view being taken by one side of the argument, and not the other side (so in some sense the disagreement begins with the existence of the dial, rather than where the dial is set). The anti-abortion crowd views abortion as murder, the pro-choice crowd does not. \n\nThe most convincing pro-choice arguments (in my opinion) aren't about at what point in the pregnancy it becomes murder, but rather that terminating a pregnancy is the right of the woman (regardless of whether or not you believe a human being is killed in that process). If you insist on seeing this through the view of a murder dial, then you can view this position as setting the dial at the moment of birth I suppose. \n\nBut this is misrepresenting the pro-choice position.

You replied with \"learn the reading and use a dictionary,\" which again doesn't actually respond to their point.

From your pair of comments, I come away with the piece of advice that you shouldn't do dedicated kanji study. You're not saying this clearly, so maybe that's not the advice you'd like to give, but that's the impression these comments give off.\n\nIn which case, I would also say that I find your advice unhelpful. This is for two reasons:\n1) If you want to learn to handwrite, I don't really see any alternative to dedicated study\n2) the Anki \"one new thing\" principle: it's far easier to memorize one unknown thing at a time than 2 or 3, so studying kanji independently from vocabulary will make it easier to learn vocabulary. (Note that the principle is reasonable regardless of whether you use Anki or not, but it has additional benefits if you keep it in mind while making Anki cards.)\n\nI have found that just doing kanji study and not vocabulary study on the common unknown kanji in the books I'm reading makes it easier for me to remember vocabulary I've looked up before the next time I encounter them in the book. Ultimately this means I spend less time looking things up and more time reading, as well as come away from my reading with greater increases in my vocabulary.\n\nOn the other hand, I also disagree with the common kanji first approach, which is brute force anywhere from 1-2k kanji with RTK up front. This is because \n1) it's unmotivated and boring for most people, which makes it hard for people to complete this task\n2) it delays learning Japanese, and if you think it's necessary to learn Japanese it may prevent you from ever getting started\n3) learning connected things together is more efficient. Learning kanji and vocabulary containing the kanji separately but at the same time is far more efficient.\n\nAnyway, obviously I'm opinionated, and I've got my current kanji learning technique which is working well for me:\nNamely, learn characters that occur frequently in what I'm reading, or characters that occur in my vocabulary flashcard decks. I.e. learn kanji and vocabulary separately but simultaneously.\n\nAnyway, while I found your comment confusing, and I disagree with what I perceived to be your advice, none of this is intended to be an attack on you personally, and I'd be curious what your opinions are on my thoughts on kanji study.", "created_utc": "1628629818.0", "edited": "False", "id": "h8ghfpu", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_p1mgkx", "parent_id": "t1_h8f5anw", "score": "14", "subreddit": "LearnJapanese", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qyls"}, {"author": "jragonfyre", "body": "Wait English uses vowel length contrastively?

In particular, don't spend too much study time on it. This is absolutely the number one thing I'd tell myself. I had downloaded and tried Anki, but I didn't really understand how to use it to get the most most out of it for language learning. The purpose of Anki is to slowly build a base of vocab and kanji in your head *while* you're doing immersion.\n\n2) Do more immersion, particularly listening immersion, or listening with Japanese subs.\n\n3) Buy a textbook, don't just try to use free online resources. You need more structure when it's your first time teaching yourself a language.\n\n4) Study vocabulary in the context of sentences as much as possible. Words don't have direct translations, sentences are critical for understanding what a word means more clearly.\n\n5) When you get to taking classes, don't rely on in class time to teach you the vocabulary. Use Anki to memorize the vocabulary, or you'll lose it by the time the final comes around.\n\n6) Don't do RTK, learn how to break down kanji and create mnemonics and stories in the RTK style, but focus on learning kanji that are in words you care about. They'll stick so much better if you're constantly seeing them.\n\n7) Start reading earlier, but not with manga. Yes, manga is more interesting, but you'll really struggle with slang and contractions. It's better to do the readings in a textbook that are at your level. It won't be too long before you can start trying to read manga. \n\n8) Stop reading romaji. It's hurting your ability to read kana quickly.\n\n9) Later on, also stop reading furigana. It hurts your ability to read kanji quickly.\n\n10) I didn't know of any good pitch accent resources, and I think the things I use today weren't around when I started, but as much as possible learn pitch accent. Yes, it's not critical for people to understand you, but it certainly helps. It's also not as much work as people make it out to be (or how it feels at first). Once you learn to hear pitch accent you'll start picking up the accents of words and how accents change in combinations naturally (yes I know you thought it was next to impossible for you personally, my past self, to hear pitch changes, but you really will learn). Relatedly, find audio for as many of your vocabulary words as possible in Anki. Hearing the words as often as possible really helps your listening comprehension and pronunciation.\n\n11) You eventually picked this up, but look up devoicing of high vowels between unvoiced consonants and what it means to say that \"f\" in Japanese is a bilabial fricative rather than a labiodental fricative like in English. It'll drastically improve your pronunciation.\n\n12) There aren't as many kanji as you think there are. 2-3000 feels like a lot, but if you learn them slowly at a steady pace, you'll get there. Also, if you learn them in roughly frequency order you'll see massive benefits in your reading ability even before you get anywhere close to 2000. Light novels seem to contain somewhere between 1.2k-1.6k distinct characters or maybe slightly outside that, with the usual frequency distribution, so maybe only 600-1000 characters appear more than once or twice in the book. \n\n13) You're probably not going to be consistent with this. You have a lot of stuff to work through, and you'll take breaks and come back to it years later. That's fine. Just keep it up as much as possible. \n\nThis is advice I'd give to the 9-10 years younger me, who had just started self studying Japanese.

It's not surprising to find hybrid Japanese/Korean materials from earlier in the occupation period.

The history of hangul is fascinating actually (though I only know a rough overview). It's over 550 years old, and it's been the official writing system several times and then abolished again. In particular the initial creation of hangul apparently faced backlash from the existing literate class because it was a threat to their status. \n\nAs for the modern adoption of hangul, I suspect it has a lot to do with anticolonial sentiment, or perhaps pride in Korean culture (being a Korean construct), or perhaps simply convenience. During the Japanese occupation of Korea (1910-1945), Japanese was made the official language of Korea, and by the end of the Japanese occupation of Korea, they had apparently banned the usage of Korean in schools and all Korean language publications. I suspect that this would have created a lot of pro-hangul sentiment in response.\n\nThe North Korean government outright banned hanja in 1949, while the South Korean government apparently discouraged its use, and it's seen a dramatic fall in usage to the point that (according to wiki) in mass media, they're primarily used along with hangul to disambiguate homophones, as abbreviations in newspaper headlines, or to give the characters in personal names.\n\nHowever, I should note that I don't think the issue is primarily one of literacy in modern Korea. Apparently both the North and South teach hanja in middle and high school. (2000 in the North, and 1800 in the South). So, while the literacy rate has risen (figures for the South) from 22% at the end of Japanese occupation to 93% by the late 80s, I suspect it's more a product of increased access to education, rather than the simultaneous gradual switch to favoring hangul over hanja, though I'm sure that did help.\n\nEdit: (disclaimer) I'm not an expert on this at all, I just find the history interesting and have read some of the wiki articles on this.

However, he also believed as president that he had to put his duty to the country above his personal values. As a result, he felt that he could only take action on slavery if he could justify it as being in the interests of the war effort.

At least on the basis in your post. I'm not really a fan of these videos anyway, but for other reasons.\n\nLet me address your points.\n\nI think the fundamental disagreement between our perception of these videos is one of where the emphasis is.\n\nIt seems you think the emphasis is on the language ability being surprising for someone of a certain race (and that this is what the video also wants you to think, reinforcing a stereotype). Instead I think the emphasis is on the fact that majority speakers are in fact surprised by the existence of minority speakers of their languages, so the videos are in fact demonstrating a violation of a stereotype. \n\nI suppose where the emphasis lies depends on the video in question, but the videos I've seen before have tended to be more in the second category. As a result, I've responded to your points below while thinking of videos that are more in the second category.\n\nTo clarify a little more what I mean, the difference between titles might be \n1) White guy speaks perfect Japanese?!?!\n2) White guy surprises locals by speaking perfect Japanese!\n(The difference is who is surprised or supposed to be surprised. Also, even in the first title, which I agree isn't great, the contents are likely to be similar to the second video, where the actual video clearly indicates that the people who are surprised are locals.)\n\n\n>1. Skin color has nothing to do with language ability.\n\nObviously. I think the point you're ignoring is that while skin color has nothing to do with language ability, languages aren't uniformly distributed. Some languages are heavily associated with certain cultures or races. This tends to create stereotypes about who does or doesn't speak a given language that are racial. \n\n>2. It perpetuates stereotypes and makes little of minorities within linguistic communities, as though speaking one\u2019s native language is somehow a feat if their ethnic features don\u2019t align with those of the average speaker. \n\nI think this point is exactly backwards. The point of such videos is to demonstrate the violation of such a stereotype. Typically the videos (that I've seen) are examples of people speaking a language usually associated with a particular race or culture (often Japanese, Chinese, or Korean), while not being members of either the racial group or the culture (oftentimes the videos feature Americans or other native English speakers, and they might start off speaking English with an American accent before switching to their other (usually not native) language).\n\nCertainly there are native speakers of all of these languages who don't fit the stereotypes associated to those languages. I don't really see how these videos make little of these people. After all, such minorities are very likely to face discrimination on a daily basis where they're assumed not to speak their native language by the majority group. Certainly it's no feat for them to speak their native language, but that's not typically what the videos are displaying.\n\n>3. Especially when a non-white person is doing it, it seems you\u2019re trying to imply that people of color can\u2019t study languages, especially those outside of their ethnic heritage.\n\nThis point doesn't make much sense to me. Even if you think the title is suggesting we ought to be surprised by a person of a given race speaking a certain language (which, again, I don't think it typically does), this makes no sense for a non-white person to try to imply that non-white people can't study languages while themselves being a counterexample.\n\nAnyway, just my thoughts.", "created_utc": "1625673343.0", "edited": "False", "id": "h4d6u2h", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_ofixk0", "parent_id": "t3_ofixk0", "score": "1", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "jragonfyre", "body": "Ahhhhh that makes so much sense, thank you!", "created_utc": "1625521219.0", "edited": "False", "id": "h465g95", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_odvyba", "parent_id": "t1_h45vzul", "score": "2", "subreddit": "LearnJapanese", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qyls"}, {"author": "jragonfyre", "body": "Hi all, have a sentence I can't parse\n\u300c\u5f53\u5e97\u306b\u5165\u308b\u305f\u3041\u76ee\u306e\u4ed8\u3051\u6240\u304c\u9055\u3046\u306a\u300d\nIt's a line of dialogue from Shield Hero.

I'm basing my recommendations on my experience, so for transparency's sake, here's my current level. I've completed Genki 1 and 2 for grammar, as well as most of Tae Kim's guide, I probably know 2-3k words, though I haven't finished the 2k deck yet, kanji level is unclear, since I'm sort of learning characters as they come up, but I probably know around 700 fairly common characters well enough that I can write them, read them and know some of their common readings, finally I've gotten auditory immersion to the point recommended above.)\n\nIf so, then here's my personal set up.\nI upload and epub to Google play books, read on my phone. If I see a word I don't know I do the following things:\n1) are the kanji familiar? If yes, can I guess the pronunciation? How about guessing the meaning from context+kanji?\n2) regardless of prior step, I copy and paste into Akebi (a dictionary), check my guesses\n3) if one of my guesses was wrong, or I couldn't guess, I highlight the word in the book, copy and paste the definition in and type in the reading. \n4) if I saw the word earlier in the book and couldn't remember it's reading or meaning I highlight it in a different color to alert future me, and I just scroll back to the note with the meaning and reading.\n5) at the end of a sentence, if I had to look stuff up, I reread the sentence so that I can comprehend everything in context.\n\nIt's sort of slow going, but sort of forms a natural and enjoyable flashcard set up. The process of looking things up and creating notes is super fast and easy this way, so it doesn't slow things down much, but it has more of a barrier than Yomichan, which I tend to use sometimes even for words I know without properly trying to read them.

I don't know your level, so I'll start explaining from the beginning.\n\nDisclaimer, I am a lower intermediate level Japanese learner. I am a native English speaker. For the grammar, this is my best current understanding of the matter. Also, take any and all Japanese example sentences with a grain of salt. \n\nWhy is it a problem to think of \u306f as meaning \"is\"?\n\nWell first of all, they're not the same kind of word at all. \n\"Is\" is a verb. \u306f is a particle. Now the concept of particles doesn't really exist in English, so it might not be clear why particles are very distinct from verbs. Let me see if I can explain particles. Particles serve many purposes in Japanese including purposes analogous to prepositions, and conjunctions conjunctions.\n\nThe closest English analog to a particle (at least to my way of thinking) is a preposition. Prepositions in English mark a word or phrase and identify how that word or phrase relates to the rest of the sentence. Particles in Japanese often have a similar behavior, except that where prepositions precede the word or phrase, particles follow the word or phrase. (This has to do with Japanese being a head-final language.)\n\nOk so \u306f is analogous to a preposition. What does it mean? Well that's complicated to answer in detail, but at a basic level it has two primary functions.\n1) Identify the current topic of conversation. This is the function you should learn first.\n2) indicate a contrast with something said before. This you'll start to notice naturally with more exposure to Japanese. \nTo be clear these are two distinct uses of \u306f.\n\nIn other words a decent English translation for:\nN\u306f Sentence\nIs: (With meaning 1)\nAs for N, Sentence.\nOr\nTalking about N, Sentence.\nOr\nOn the topic of N, Sentence.\n\nWith meaning 2, it's more like\nBut as for N, Sentence.\n\nOk so that's the meaning of \u306f, why is it important to think of it this way?\n\nWell there's the classic example.\n\u79c1\u306f\u3046\u306a\u304e\u3067\u3059\u3002\nThe correct translation of this depends on the context.\nAt a restaurant, this probably means\nAs for me, it'll be eel.\n\nHowever if you think of \u306f as meaning \"is,\" you'll translate this as \nI am an eel. \n\nWhile in some contexts this might be a correct translation, I'm really struggling to come up with a prompt for which this sounds like a reasonable response.\n\nMaybe something like this exchange between idk talking fish?\n\u3042\u306a\u305f\u306f\u3069\u3093\u306a\u52d5\u7269\u3067\u3059\u304b\uff1f\n\u3042\u3001\u79c1\u306f\u3046\u306a\u304e\u3067\u3059\u3002\n\nAnyway, hopefully this was either interesting or useful.", "created_utc": "1624552706.0", "edited": "False", "id": "h2wh96f", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_o6vxl3", "parent_id": "t1_h2w71q4", "score": "2", "subreddit": "LearnJapanese", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qyls"}, {"author": "jragonfyre", "body": "Apparently the underlying assumptions are also just wrong. https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/aug/03/viral-image/blake-griffin-and-ex-fiancee-say-he-doesnt-pay-258/", "created_utc": "1624549841.0", "edited": "False", "id": "h2waqen", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_o6szo5", "parent_id": "t3_o6szo5", "score": "2", "subreddit": "confidentlyincorrect", "subreddit_id": "t5_2cn1kk"}, {"author": "jragonfyre", "body": "You don't need to do it to every note.

One thing that's helpful is to look at special cases.\n\nFor example, if G is a group (regarded as a single object category), then a functor G -> Set is a set X with a left action of G. The covariant hom functor corresponds to the G-set which is G itself with left action by multiplication. The Yoneda lemma in this context says that a map, f, of G-sets G -> X is determined by f(1) (and f(1) can be chosen to be any element of X). The proof of the Yoneda lemma in this context is that f(g)=f(g\u20221)=g\u2022f(1).\n\nI.e. the Yoneda lemma says that G regarded as a G-set in the usual way is free on one generator.\n\nAnother example. Let C = 0 -> 1 be the category with two objects and a single nonidentity arrow, which I'll call a. Functors from this category to sets are pairs of sets with a function between them. The representable functors C(0,-) and C(1,-) are {id_0} -> {a} and {} -> {id_1}. (Both maps of sets here are unique). The Yoneda lemma then says that the first functor represents sending a functor (f : A -> B) to A, because we can send id_0 to any element, x, of A, and then we have to send a to f(x). Similarly the second functor represents sending (f : A -> B) to B, because we can send id_1 anywhere.\n\nThe idea is that the Yoneda lemma is saying that Hom(A, -) is freely generated as a functor by id_A.

As I understand it, there are several different scholarly points of view on what exactly constitutes fascism. I'm not an expert, but my layperson's understanding is the following.\n\nFascism is often described as having palingenetic ultranationalism as a key belief. Palingenesis means roughly rebirth, and palingenetic ultranationalism refers to the idea that the nation has fallen from a once glorious past, and that it needs to be reborn or recreated in the image of that past. The ultranationalism component also means that the nation is regarded as the most important thing, and other states are regarded as inferior, to be conquered and subdued by the nation. \n\nFascism also needs an explanation for why the nation has fallen. For which the answer is \"our enemies.\" Fascism tends to label certain groups (often racial, ethnic, religious, or sexual minorities) as a whole as enemies of the nation and the nation's people. Fascism forms an us vs them mentality.\n\nFascism is also usually centered around a key figure, regarded as a great and visionary leader who will restore the tarnished legacy of the nation. Combining a great leader with a demand that everything and everyone serve the nation explains why fascism is extremely authoritarian, and tends towards dictatorship. Democracy is anathema, because disagreeing with the fascists means being a traitor to the nation in their eyes.\n\nAnyway, that's a brief summary of my understanding of fascism, you can double check some of this on the wikipedia pages for fascism or palingenetic ultranationalism, or investigate the beliefs of various historical fascist movements.\n\nThe point I'm making is that fascist movements might dislike democracy, but that doesn't mean they won't use it to take power. The NSDAP (the Nazis), perhaps the most well known fascist movement gained power initially through a democratic election, as I understand it. \n\nBeing supported by a majority of people would not make something not fascist. Again, fascism is a political ideology. Similarly fascism is not political violence. Any political ideology might use violence to further their goals, and it would be equally reprehensible, but it would only be fascism if the people doing the violence hold fascist ideology.", "created_utc": "1612227897.0", "edited": "1612228094.0", "id": "glob73s", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_la4lom", "parent_id": "t1_glnpsde", "score": "2", "subreddit": "worldnews", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13"}, {"author": "jragonfyre", "body": "Fascism is a political ideology, not a form of government.
