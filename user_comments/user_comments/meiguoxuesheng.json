I remember PAVC books had example sentences for every chapter's list of new vocabulary words, which was helpful. \u7576\u4ee3 doesn't, but puts more vocabulary in each lesson which I appreciate. I did think PAVC was a little more simple than it needed to be at times, but it's hard to say because I used PAVC when I was more of a beginner and \u7576\u4ee3 when I was at a more intermediate stage. \u7576\u4ee3 does have weird passages that are in English for some reason, but they're very ignorable. Also, \u7576\u4ee3's audio files are much easier to access since you can download them for free, while the PAVC ones come on a CD.\n\nMy real advice here would be to get a tutor for yourself, even if you only see them once a week.

If they do, the US' reason for breaking it would only have to do with FoN; it wouldn't be a problem of getting the military supplies through. This might make the US reluctant to act militarily.\n\nSo now i'm wondering, might Beijing still do a quarantine to achieve greater sovereignty over Taiwan? Would it be viewed as such by the rest of the world? On one hand they would have lined the island with military ships that can decide what comes in or out (at least by sea). On the other hand, they would publicly fail at stopping military equipment from getting into the island, their supposed reason for needing to impose a quarantine in the first place.

Most people I knew here took a week or two in an Airbnb to find a place.\n\nNever been to Kaosiung (regretfully) but I hear nice things about it from everyone except Taiwanese Kaosiungers who've moved to Taipei and think it's too boring lol. Otherwise, people say it's cheaper, more relaxed (although I think Taipei is already a very chill city), the weather is better, and other perks. The air quality is worse than Taipei but we're all wearing masks anyways I suppose. \n\nIf you're worried about learning Chinese in Kaosiung I don't think running into too many people who only speak Taiwanese will be your problem. Chinese skills are much more necessary down there than in Taipei where most people speak decent English, so I think your skills might actually develop faster out of necessity. On the other hand, I don't know anything at all about the quality of Mandarin training programs in Kaosiung, but my guess is they're not too different from Taipei. \n\nHES 1-year recipients can choose to change their school, but I remember there is a limited amount of time they have to change, so look into that if you think you might change.

I did an HES at taida (which to be fair is more expensive than shida) and I didn't know many people there who were just surviving on their HES, and those I did know seemed to really be struggling. \n\nThe biggest cost living here is rent. When I first got here I found a small room in an apartment with 5 housemates for 9500 nt per month. If you spend more time looking you might be able to find something better, especially if you live in New Taipei, but be prepared to spend a good amount of the 25k on a place that isn't great. [This](https://www.facebook.com/groups/Taiwanapartmentsandroommates) facebook group should give you an idea of what's available. Most foreigners I know here found their place through that group. \n\nThe other major marketplace for renters in [591.com.tw](https://591.com.tw) but it's all in chinese, rentals are all 1 year minimum, and the placements worth looking at are 15k+nt. Other commenters have mentioned Taofangs, but in my opinion those are more expensive for less; they feel very much like long-term hotels (i.e 1 bedroom no kitchen) and really are only good for people who value living alone over anything else.\n\nAs far as other things go, I don't really imagine that Taipei would be much more expensive than other cities, but I would still recommend coming here expecting to use some of your own savings to get by. I can give you details on specific costs of living here, but generally I spend around 35-40,000 nt per month before tuition.\n\nThat being said, Taipei is a really great city with great people and learning chinese is very fun and exciting, definitely worth the extra few thousand you I think you'll need per month.
