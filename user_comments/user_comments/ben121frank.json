Anyway I\u2019m gonna do my team rankings in order of how much I like them through the first 2 episodes\n\n10: Rich & Dom. I hate being a hater especially on someone trying to be so positive but I just find Dom really really annoying and every time they\u2019re on screen I find myself rooting for them to get booted. I think they will soon, just don\u2019t seem like they have the potential to be a very strong team\n\nTied for 8: Luis & Michelle and Aubrey & David. Honestly I still have trouble telling these 2 teams apart. They\u2019re both pretty uninteresting and not adding much to the season imo. I don\u2019t see either team going that far\n\n7: Emily & Molly. I love their story and I like them a lot, but they have been somewhat overshadowed thus far I think. I see them as a mid boot\n\n6: Marcus & Michael. I like these guys a lot, absolutely nothing against them and in other seasons they would be a lot higher, but I just like other teams more at this point. They seem like a very strong team and I definitely see them going far tho.\n\n5: Abby & Will. I always love when TAR superfans get the chance to race, and it seems like they\u2019re making the most of it. They bring joy to the screen every time they\u2019re on it, and I think their relationship is really sweet. I see them as a mid-boot tho.\n\n4: Glenda & Lumumba. The top 4 were hard for me because I really love each of the teams. For Glenda & Lumumba I love their energy and love for each other, but just like the other teams a little more I think. I see them going far\n\n3: Quinton & Mattie: I really love MF friend teams which are way too rare, and these two are no exception. I love their friendship and how they maintain positivity and don\u2019t get angry at each other even through setbacks. Their comeback this episode was truly impressive. They\u2019re kinda a wild card for me, because they can clearly beast through challenges but also seem pretty susceptible to stupid mistakes. Right now I see them as a mid boot but they could easily move up\n\n2: Derek & Claire. I really love the sense of humor they have towards each other and the race. They also seems to have a very healthy and supportive relationship and they\u2019re just tons of fun to watch. I see them going very far, at this point they would be my winner prediction if I had to make one. They remind me a lot of Henry & Evan from S30 (maybe just bc they look so similar but dynamic wise too I think) but a more fun to watch version\n\n1: Linton & Sharik: They are just adorable. It seems like they have such a great relationship and every time they\u2019re on screen it just makes me happy. Easily one of my favorite parent/child teams ever. Right now I see them as a mid-late boot, but could also be a sleeper for final 3.Right now my final 3 prediction is Derek & Claire, Glenda & Lumumba, and Marcus & Michale, with Linton & Sharik placing 4th, we\u2019ll see how that holds up.

My go to daily outfit is a Polo Ralph Lauren button up (I have a large collection in both SS and LS) with tech pants and athletic shoes or hiking sandals or boots depending on weather.

I don\u2019t think being underdressed for occasions is my problem. \n\nI am not generally a big spender in other areas of my life either, I enjoy a relatively simple and nature-based lifestyle. I also prefer to save and donate most of my money. But I do have rather sizable person savings and investment portfolio, and occasionally I enjoy spending some of it, most commonly at nice restaurants. \n\nI was recently aboard for 6 weeks and developed an appreciation for nice wine and views and sought out restaurants for this, but often felt overlooked by waiters and bartenders who would give a lot of attention to more \u201cwealthy looking\u201d (I guess) customers while barely acknowledging me. This was upsetting to me bc I did have money and was intending to spend it. I also tip well (25% usually in the US, varies abroad but always above the expectation) and think I generally carry myself with confidence and kindness. So how do I present myself as someone worth attention to waiters? (Not needing to look like a millionaire, just that I\u2019m not a totally broke college kid) \n\nI like my current wardrobe and don\u2019t really want to significantly adjust it. But I would be very open to buying some kind of nice accessory or a few new items if that would help? Or is it my manner that I need to adjust?
