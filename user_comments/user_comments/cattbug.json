Furthermore, the article has mentions of e.g. the German writing system or Modern English writing system.\n\nSo the OP you replied to was actually being ambiguous by listing \"Cyrillic\" as one of the writing systems they learned. And the more I think about it, the more it makes sense - you can't just \"learn\" Latin or Cyrillic outside of the context of a language that uses it, because the characters of a script by themselves have no inherent meaning.\\*\n\nFor example, I'm originally from Northern Macedonia, I don't actually speak the language but I can read Macedonian Cyrillic. If you give me a text in Russian I could probably get somewhat of an idea of what it sounds like, but I still wouldn't be able to actually read it because I am not familiar with that specific Cyrillic writing system. Which is probably what you were getting at :p\n\nAnother good example might be Norwegian which has two writing systems Nynorsk and Bokm\u00e5l based on the Latin alphabet. Same language, same script, but two different sets of rules on how to use that script.\n\n\\* Unless we're looking at scripts like Japanese Kana or Korean Hangul, where the rules of the language are \"hard-coded\" into the script itself. But even this would be subject to change if any other language were to use one of these scripts - kind of like what happened with Chinese characters in the form of Japanese Kanji.\n\nIt's interesting because in western countries you might be asked \"can you read German\" or \"can you read French\", but on the other hand you'll hear \"can you read Cyrillic\" and never \"can you read the Latin script\" which obviously makes no sense. It's like we do have an inherent understanding of how languages have different writing systems even when using the same script but fail to apply that to languages we're not as familiar with. Buuuuut the eurocentrism in linguistics is not a can of worms I want to open right now so I'll just leave it at that lmao.\n\nThanks a lot for the great discussion, I very much enjoyed it and learned something new! :D", "created_utc": "1661936482.0", "edited": "False", "id": "imhze4f", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_x05jin", "parent_id": "t1_imgxrkv", "score": "2", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "cattbug", "body": "Thanks for making the effort of typing all that out, I was already well aware of all those differences but it was still entertaining to read :D\n\nHowever the original comment you replied to was referring to writing systems.

Nat\u00fcrlich k\u00f6nnte sich genauso irgendwann rausstellen, dass Pflanzen und Pilze auch leidensf\u00e4hig sind, aber von irgendetwas m\u00fcssen wir uns ja ern\u00e4hren :D Und an dem Punkt w\u00fcrde die Diskussion vermutlich auch \u00fcber die aktuelle Auffassung von Veganismus hinausgehen und ist nicht zuverl\u00e4ssig mit den Annahmen, die wir derzeit haben, zu argumentieren.\n\nIch finde es pers\u00f6nlich wichtiger, zwischen Veganismus als ethische Grundhaltung und Veganismus als Lebensstil zu unterscheiden, anstatt Einzelheiten auszudiskutieren und zu versuchen, alles kategorisch in \"vegan\" und \"nicht-vegan\" einzuteilen, weil dabei so viele Nuancen verloren gehen und es meiner Meinung nach einfach nicht zielf\u00fchrend ist. So kann man sich viel eher ein Bild davon machen, welche Ethik dem zugrundeliegt, und dann liegt es im Ermessen jedes Einzelnen, ob er diese Ethik tats\u00e4chlich so weit wie m\u00f6glich und praktikabel umsetzt, wozu eben auch geh\u00f6rt, zu verstehen, wenn man widerspr\u00fcchlich handelt, ohne dass das gleich dazu f\u00fchrt, dass man seine Veganerkarte abgenommen bekommt oder auf der anderen Seite den Begriff so ausreizt, dass er v\u00f6llig an Bedeutung verliert. Ist ein bisschen philosophisch, hoffe es ist trotzdem halbwegs verst\u00e4ndlich, was ich damit meine.\n\nFinde es auf jeden Fall sehr sch\u00f6n, dass wir hier so differenziert dar\u00fcber sprechen k\u00f6nnen, also danke auch dir f\u00fcr diese Diskussion :)", "created_utc": "1612881305.0", "edited": "False", "id": "gmp82yy", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_ldhr5j", "parent_id": "t1_gmoxgd3", "score": "3", "subreddit": "VeganDE", "subreddit_id": "t5_37ruc"}, {"author": "cattbug", "body": "Wenn jetzt noch jemand auf Grillfeiern mit nicht-veganem Knobibrot aufkreuzt, wird dem die Freundschaft gek\u00fcndigt, einfach keine Ausrede mehr", "created_utc": "1612865158.0", "edited": "False", "id": "gmom0vt", "is_submitter": "True", "link_id": "t3_lfopc3", "parent_id": "t1_gmnb44y", "score": "4", "subreddit": "VeganDE", "subreddit_id": "t5_37ruc"}, {"author": "cattbug", "body": "An dem Tzaziki ist nichts m\u00f6chtegern!", "created_utc": "1612826274.0", "edited": "False", "id": "gmmxt7c", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_leur81", "parent_id": "t1_gmi9we2", "score": "3", "subreddit": "VeganDE", "subreddit_id": "t5_37ruc"}, {"author": "cattbug", "body": "> finde nicht, dass Insekten in die vegane Definition fallen, da sie nach wissenschaftlichem Kenntnisstand keinen Schmerz (wie wir ihn kennen) empfinden k\u00f6nnen und keine tieferen Emotionen besitzen, die leid nach unserem Verst\u00e4ndnis m\u00f6glich machen w\u00fcrden.\n\nFinde ich schwierig. \u00dcber Neugeborene hat man bis vor kurzem auch noch gedacht, dass sie keinen Schmerz empfinden k\u00f6nnen und deshalb routinem\u00e4\u00dfig ohne Narkose operiert. Hat man im Sinne des Veganismus nicht eher die Verpflichtung, in derartigen Grauzonen auf Nummer sicher zu gehen?\n\nUnd weil du deinen Hund erw\u00e4hnt hast: Es ist nichts verwerfliches daran, nicht-vegane Dinge zu tun, wenn sie f\u00fcr einen (ganz nach der Definition von Veganismus) nicht praktikabel sind. Meine Katzen kriegen z.B. aus verschiedenen Gr\u00fcnden auch keine vegane Nahrung.

I'm not talking against filters, if used properly (like you described) they can add so much to an image (and it shows in your photos!). Being able to do at least some good color/lighting correction (which you also categorize as a filter) is pretty much a prerequisite to good photography. I'm entirely on the same page on that issue.\n\nMy problem with that statement was that what most people think when they hear \"filters\" is what they know from Instagram etc. Just a preset that's applied by the single press of a button. When they see professionally edited photos and hear \"Photoshop is all filters\", they're gonna think that's all it takes to create things like that, and dismiss the actual amount of work that's actually required.\n\nAnd I disagree that even in the context of photography it's just filters. Painting techniques have been applied to photography for a long time, for example [airbrushing in film photography that is literally painting over a photo](https://i2.wp.com/tikhonoff.ru/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/101.jpg?resize=640%2C435), or creating composite artworks [like this guy](https://www.deviantart.com/maxasabin/art/Golden-blue-Editing-low-quaity-photo-613270202). Of course one could argue at what point it ventures from photography into the territory of digital art, but imo this example still looks realistic enough that you could believe it's an actual photograph taken as you see it (plus post processing of course).\n\n> And, for photographers, photoshop is pretty much all filters. Yes, people will add or subtract or create elements in their images depending on how fantastical they want their final result to be (creating fire, making things look futuristic, composting elements).\n\n> But, in order to even apply those changes to the areas you want and exclude them from the areas you don\u2019t want to change, you need a filter\n\nBut this is what I'm saying. Yes, filters are needed for that. But the point is that it's not *just* filters. You can't create effects or composite images by just applying a filter because no software in the world is advanced enough to be able to do that without any manual input.\n\nPhotography is art, and claiming it's \"just filters\" sounds like you could lump professional photo editing together with applying a preset filter in instagram - and imo that just does a great disservice to photographers who deserve recognition for the artistic work they do.", "created_utc": "1588161106.0", "edited": "False", "id": "foxz8pz", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_g9f64g", "parent_id": "t1_foxxnda", "score": "1", "subreddit": "delusionalartists", "subreddit_id": "t5_2wtsv"}, {"author": "cattbug", "body": "I mean, I have used Photoshop for digital painting so that literally disproves your point.

Meat happens to be a great source of basically all of these except carbohydrates. Plants, while more abundant, are harder to get protein, fat, and certain nutrients from. Eating carefully can allow you to remove one or the other group from your diet. Or you could just eat both. \n\nMacronutrient deficiency is pretty much nonexistent in a diet with adequate calories. Hell, you could technically eat 2000kcal of just lettuce and you'd get the recommended amounts of carbs and protein. Avocados, nuts, and seeds for example are excellent sources of fat while avoiding cholesterol, saturated and trans fats usually found in animal products. The only thing missing is B12, which many processed foods (like plant milks) are enriched with, or you could just take a cheap supplement.\n\nThere's literally no need for anyone in a developed country to consume meat and animal products for nutrition, so why choose the alternative that causes unnecessary suffering? \n\n>Which is why most people do. We've got 6 billion years of evolution putting us in omnivore mode.\n\nAppeal to nature aside, evolution also put us in a \"produce as much offspring as possible\" mode, yet we use birth control.

It also didn't prepare us for riding cars or planes, even gives us motion sickness sometimes when we do, yet we still do it. Technology and living standards have improved so much and so quickly, evolution hasn't had time to \"catch up\".

Having a cat is manageable, having a pet cow in your apartment is not.\n\nWell, first of all, the world is not going to go vegan overnight. I'm not that unrealistic. These animals are bred because there's demand. As more and more people stop paying for these products, they will stop breeding them (because it makes no sense to breed and feed animals that won't bring you any profit).

Why should they ever quit paying for the exploitation of animals when even vegans say that it's enough to do meatless mondays and cut out just a little bit? Unless it becomes frowned upon by the majority, people will continue doing what they're used to. And that's only achieved by people being strictly and openly against exploitation of any kind and in any numbers, no matter how much effort is being made to reduce, because reduction is simply not enough.\n\nVegans are not obligated to paint a good picture of \"veganism\". They are advocates for animals that can't speak for themselves and their only obligation is to stand up for that. If people don't want to go vegan because \"a vegan was mean to me once\" that's on them, but luckily most people have at least a bit of logical thinking and moral integrity and help drive the movement to a point where it will be enforced on a large scale by putting pressure on the market and governments.", "created_utc": "1531385577.0", "edited": "False", "id": "e28u0t8", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_8y2oye", "parent_id": "t1_e28tkhb", "score": "-6", "subreddit": "vegan", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhpm"}, {"author": "cattbug", "body": "Same here.

Let's keep with the previous analogy: \"My grand parents were plantation owners and I love wearing cotton because not only am I able to have a garment I really enjoy but I also enjoy supporting their business and industry. I also only wear suits made in the south that are 100% cotton because again, I love my family and want to support their business and industry.\" Doesn't sound so good now, does it?\n\nBefore you say this is not a good comparison, I'm not putting slavery and animal agriculture on the same level, but there is one fundamental parallel: You're exploiting somebody else for your own benefit, whether that's the slaves picking your cotton, or the animal being abused and killed for your steak. And wanting to support the \"family business\" is not a justification to continue doing it.\n\n>I can completely sympathies with the vegan lifestyle, but almost everyone does something morally wrong. Some people drive which contributes to pollution, some people eat meat which contributes to animal cruelty, some people buy products that are manufactured by children in far away places. That\u2019s life, unless you are an absolutely perfect human being as much as you hate others eating meat you\u2019re more than likely contributing your share of immoral activities in society also, it\u2019s not fair to place one moral high ground above another because they are all different.\n\n[This is a fallacy.](https://yourveganfallacyis.com/en/you-cannot-be-100-percent-vegan)\n\n>Vegans do have a ton of arguments in their favour without having to compare completely random incomparable situations to make a point.

With the abundance of plant-based alternatives, no one is forced to eat meat to be healthy. The only reason people do it is because they like it and completely disregard the animal that had to suffer and give his life for their unnecessary, selfish pleasure. \n\n>to put it this way, you\u2019ll eat any fruit and vegetable.

We have the required technical and medical advances to do these things that ultimately benefit our lives in some way. The benefits of veganism on health, environment and the lives of animals outweigh the inconvenience of having to supplement B12 (again, something our medical advances allow us to do).\n\nTwo other things that others in this thread have probably pointed out, so I'm not gonna elaborate on them too much: even our livestock is B12 deficient, so people who eat meat and animal products basically get their B12 via supplements too, only they are fed to the animals whose parts they later consume. Nothing natural about that. Secondly, B12 is naturally found in soil and untreated water. We used to get it by eating unwashed produce and drinking untreated water. It's obvious why it's better that we don't do that anymore.\n\nLastly, this is an [appeal to nature](https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/appeal-to-nature).

You can get vaccinated against other diseases, you can stay inside and not get mugged/shot, you can just not go on that rock climbing trip and not risk breaking a limb. All other ailments, we're in some way \"responsible\" for getting in harm's way (please note that I don't meant this literally, just what many might be feeling on a subconscious level or tell themselves - no one actively chooses getting sick or hurt with any of their actions, of course.)\n\nWith cancer however, there's really nothing you can do. You can never touch a cigarette in your life, avoid all red meat and processed foods and whatever else people say is bad for you - and still you're always at risk of some cell in your body going rogue for absolutely no reason and destroying you.\n\nSo saying people are actively \"fighting\" or \"beating\" cancer implies something crucial - they're saying that you can take control of it, and whether you survive and recover is entirely in your power. They're saying that on the off chance it happens to them, it would not be up to luck but only their own willpower. So it's a way of taking back agency and reassuring and protecting yourself from the harsh reality of it - that sometimes it just doesn't matter what you do or how hard you fight.\n\nI think it's just a self-defense/coping mechanism humans display in a variety of ways. We often try to find blame in someone or something because we don't want to accept that some things are just out of our control.\n\nAnother similar thing that comes to mind is \"fighting depression\". That's also something you can't really protect yourself from and can happen to anyone at any time.
