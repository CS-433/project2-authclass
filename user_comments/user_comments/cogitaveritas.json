Bear with me, but if you don\u2019t feel like reading a wall of text I understand. \n\nEssentially, when you want to set up machine learning, and to some extent AI, you need a data source to pull from. So, you use historical data. But, and I think we can all agree on this even if we don\u2019t agree on modern day racism, the United States in the past was racist as fuck. So all of our data from that is tarnished. Historically, cops targeted Black people in the US, and so historical data shows more arrests and convictions for Black people. Feed that into a machine learning algorithm, and it\u2019s going to naturally assume that being Black means you are more likely to commit a crime, and will therefore be biased. Worse, it could use that bias to make decisions, which leads to Black people being convicted more, which confirms its bias. (This actually has happened historically, when some courts used machine learning algorithms to decide on bail and probation terms. It would give harsher decisions on Black people, because the data was tainted.)\n\nHumans do the same thing. If the police think Black people commit the most crimes, they will treat Black people like that. Being treated like a criminal does actually drive people into committing crimes. It becomes a nasty feedback loop that is fueled by racism. It\u2019s not a \u201crace\u201d thing, it\u2019s a systemic oppression thing. \n\nThere are a lot of good research papers, articles, and even podcasts about this, both from a law standpoint and a data ethics standpoint, that are very interesting to read. \n\nPlus, as someone who came from a moderately racist Mississippi family, data ethics is actually one of the things that helped me see how unfairly our current system disadvantages people. \n\nAnyway, I hope you look into it, it\u2019s very interesting stuff.\n\ntl;dr: Racist assumptions cause cops and the judicial system to look for, charge, and convict minorities over white non-Hispanic people. This causes them to find more, reinforcing the belief. Eventually this attitude disadvantages people so much that some criminal acts become worth the risk, which causes the original racist beliefs to reinforce themselves and creates a self-fulfilling prophecy. The vicious cycle continues, and also spreads the original racist belief to people who didn\u2019t originally agree with it.

Bear spray hurts bears mostly by smell, and isn't designed to incapacitate because you want the bear to run away, not for it to be angrily swiping around itself in pain. Human spray affects eyes and lungs more, and is meant to incapacitate a human so that YOU can run away; you DO want the human angrily and blindly swinging around while you escape.\n\nBear spray also fires further and in a spread pattern, to ensure some of it gets in the bears nose. Human spray has a shorter range but shoots in a jet to help you aim for the face.\n\nIt's confusing because some sites will point out various numbers and legal limits, but at the end of the day the oleoresin capsicum concentration is what matters, and it is lower in bears.\n\n(Also, since most bear attacks are from humans startling bears, no one wants to kill the bear and so we try to give the lowest effective dose to them, to ensure that they regret their action and live to learn from it. Humans, on the other hand, are smart enough to know what they are getting into and thus earn the burn they get.)\n\nTL;DR: Bears don't usually want to fight and need less pain to give up and run, humans tend to want to fight and need more pain to make them leave you alone.", "created_utc": "1656476704.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ie5b69x", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_vmphqg", "parent_id": "t1_ie3g1h5", "score": "1", "subreddit": "PublicFreakout", "subreddit_id": "t5_2yrq6"}, {"author": "cogitaveritas", "body": "I live in a neighborhood that's only just had lights installed in some places, and some of them are already that purple color.

Engines don't shoot, so claiming it shoots ions blasts out the back would directly contradict the movies, since Lucas never redefined \"engines\" to mean \"guns.\" (Also, an ion engine is a real world thing, and very commonly used in science fiction.)\n\nAnyway look, you obviously subscribe to \"biggest asshole wins the argument,\" so I'm done.

All books were approved by Lucas himself. The A-Wing had rotating cannons, even if they were never shown in the films. Hundreds of things from the EU are considered canon still, the biggest being Admiral Thrawn, who was in the TIE fighter game, in the TV shows, mentioned in Mandalorian, has his own new series of books (that are canon), and he was created by Timothy Zahn in the EU. Just because it wasn't in the films doesn't make it not canon!\n\nThe ONLY way I will ever concede this is if you can prove to me that having rotating cannons DIRECTLY CONTRADICTS the movies.

I will give you, though, that I just turned on the X-Wing Squadrons game on my PS5 to make sure, and there is no ability to rotate the cannons. Then again, I would also probably throw up in VR if I had to manage that as well, so I can see why it is not included.\n\nI also owned several of the Action Fleet toys in the 90s and 00s. The A-Wing guns swiveled.\n\nSo I can PROMISE you that it is not something 2.0 X-Wing created. It was a well-known fact to Star Wars fans in the 90s and beyond, so I don't have any idea why you missed it. But if the only Star Wars you consumed was the films and the video games, I guess I could see it.\n\nBut I mean, if you're going to be an absolute \"it must be in the movies and nothing else counts ever\" about it, I guess that's your call. Pretty weird line to draw, though, since this entire miniature game draws on so many more sources than the films. (And the rotating lasers weren't created for a toy; again, the CCG and the official Star Wars website both claim A-Wings rotate their cannons.)\n\nThe movies never show an A-Wing rotate their cannons, but they also never state that they can't. I mean, it also never says that shots can be fired with S-Foils closed on an X-Wing, but no one seems to have an issue with that. It never actually stated that A-Wings are faster or less shielded than an X-Wing, but we're all good with that? B-Wings just showed up in the third movie with no explanation, either.

It\u2019s like saying, \u201cDo animals have a sense of beauty? Well, they have eyes so of course they do.\u201d Pain is much more than an instantaneous reaction to outside stimuli.

A hertz is one cycle, with the number being how many occur in one second. My studies were in electrical engineering, so when converting analog to digital, the sampling would be done of the amplitude of the current, and that would be what was stored. When converting back to analog, the converter would basically perform the task of mapping the amplitude to its correct position in time, recreating the frequency (hertz) of the wave function.

There will always be a time period for which the pressure wave exists, because if it didn't there would be no pressure wave. The \"point\" in your line graph isn't actually a zero-point, it's a discrete point with a duration. (This is why if you look up Analog to Digital converters, they talk about discrete times and signals.) Each \"step\" has an amplitude and it exists for a non-zero length of time. You could argue that, zoomed in close enough, the \"staircase\" would look more like a series of dashes, but that's the most pedantic you could actually get. It tends to be shows as a staircase, though, because you can't replace it with just \"zero\" amplitude, because that would be a different and incorrect mark in the wave form.

But then again, you could say that about a lot of God's punishments.\n\nThe reasons supporting the most common belief, which is the literal translation, is that the very next line makes it clear that SEEING your father naked was very bad, since the other brothers hid their faces the entire time they were in the tent to cover Noah. And, when discussing rape and incest later on in the Bible (Lot, for example) there is not any mincing of words. They come straight out and say that they laid together, they came, and they got pregnant.\n\nAt the end of the day, though, most of the Bible is written to justify atrocities later on.
