Most people here who hunt do so with their families so they are taught to shoot from a fairly young age and go on hunts with their parents or other members at first. I went with my uncle and adult cousins. \n\nWe can also lose the ability to hunt with crimes. Felons are not allowed to own guns at all, so obviously they cannot hunt. \n\nAnother thing is that the US is significantly more rural than Germany and there are many more hunters. The number of hunters now is much less than 50 years ago and still close to 5% of the population, compared to less than 0.5% of Germans who hunt, and in rural areas this number is much higher.

I don't know how far back you want me to go, but I did my Bachelor's in Chemistry and then did a PhD in nuclear chemistry/physics.

My group was the only one doing this technique in the US, but there are quite a few research groups in Europe who use it. As far as I know, I am the first postdoc in Europe from the US in this subfield. When I was getting ready to graduate, my research advisor and the postdoc in our group, who is from Darmstadt, both sent me the advertisement. I think that it was sent to a mailing group for one of the European particle accelerators. The very specific things I did for my PhD and what they were looking for matched up almost exactly, they were studying things that I liked, and I thought it would be cool to live in another country for a couple years. I sent them a research statement, detailing what I have done and what I am interested in, and three letters of recommendation. My now current boss worked at the same university where I did my PhD and knew all of my recommenders. They offered me an interview, where I gave an hour long talk over zoom about my PhD research. The people who attended were members of our collaboration. Then my now current boss had a video call with my research advisor to ask him about me, and I don't really know the details of what they talked about but my research advisor told me that they liked me.

Right now, the folks at CERN want to replace the Large Hadron Collider with a new circular accelerator that is 4 times larger. Right now the project is called the Future Circular Collider, which you can google for more articles, but essentially there isn\u2019t a clear cut answer on what will be found with a larger, more powerful accelerator. With the LHC, they had the Higgs Boson to discover, but there really isn\u2019t a new particle that we would expect, but I have heard it referred to as a \u201cHiggs factory\u201d, where they can produce and study large amounts of the Higgs boson for more precise measurements. The hope is that if we can do these more precise measurements, we can learn more about the Higgs and also potentially find something unexpected that points to a flaw in the Standard Model of physics. \n\nThat being said, there is some pretty vocal opposition to the project, as it isn\u2019t clear what exactly we will learn, and the money can be better spent for other experiments. One of the most vocal opponents that I have seen is named Sabine Hossenfelder, if you google here you can read more.\n\nAlso, I believe that China is building a competing facility, which is about the size of the proposed Future Circular Collider. I don\u2019t know too much about the project, as 1. I am not a particle physicist, and 2. I have noticed that nuclear physics experiments performed in China don\u2019t often get published in the main journals I read. I am not sure if they are mostly publishing in their own, or if it is because the program is still developing there. \n\nOutside of CERN, there are large accelerator facilities that are being built that will have really big impacts on our understanding of the nucleus, specifically the Facility for Rare Isotope Beams at Michigan State University, the Electron-Ion Collider at Brookhaven National Lab in the USA, and the RAON project in Korea.

Two other half siblings also appeared, and the details also supported the fact that they had the same father. It\u2019s very likely that the person that showed up on your account is a half sibling. It can mess up the relations sometimes, like saying that they are an aunt or uncle, but with 28% shared dna and only three years age difference, it is not likely that they are siblings of your parents.

In the Midwest and Pennsylvania many anabaptists immigrated and generally continued speaking both their own dialect and High German which was the language used in church. After World War I began many of these communities began to transition to English. As an example,in Berne Indiana they were not forced to switch but it was a conscious decision because of the pressure. The church began to give one sermon a month in English, starting the transition. I do not know if that is the same situation other communities experienced at the time. World War II was also a factor. The number of children learning German was falling by the 1930s but when the Nazis took power, it fell further. One of the core tenants of the anabaptists in the region was pacifism, and they faced a lot of criticism for both speaking the language of the enemy and for not fighting. In Berne the KKK threatened church members and burned crosses in the yard of the church. There are still some German speaking anabaptists communities like the Old Order Amish, the Hutterites, and some Mennonite communities, but it is not really a community language beyond these groups. \n\nAnecdotally, my grandparents were born to Swiss Mennonite families in Indiana and they did not speak German or attend Mennonite churches but their parents did. My greatgrandfather moved north to Michigan. My father lived with him and they would spend a lot of time at Amish houses, I am assuming because there were similarities with how he grew up.

My sister is a recovering heroin addict and I would not wish what she went through and what my family went through on my worst enemy. The glorification of drugs doesn't promote responsible use. Your initial comment about meth was meant to paint meth as medicine and then you expanded to say that using more than the therapeutic dose isn't responsible, that is why I brought up what you dose your drugs at. \n\nI do not think you can separate drug use and addiction. Just ignoring the problem doesn't mean there isn't a problem. It may not be the majority of drug users that develop an addiction but that doesn't make it not a problem. http://www.sciencedirect.com.libproxy.library.wmich.edu/science/article/pii/S0899328996902497 . This study found that 20-26% of drug users born since around the 1950's developed an addiction. That is a huge number. I am not angry at your reference to alcohol, I just do not see how it supports your own view that drugs are great. I am not a fan of alcohol as well as other drugs. It causes a ton of social harm and kills a lot of people every year.  \n\nRegarding how we should deal with addiction, I think that we should discourage use, provide more avenues for treatment for addicts, stop incarcerating people for possession or use, not pretend that addiction isn't a problem. It doesn't need to be an all or nothing situation. We don't have to have either total prohibition and zero tolerance or total legalization with no limits.

I just looked up what the typical dose for recreational use of meth. It is 40 mg for a first time user. So that is almost the maximum therapeutic dose for a week. Basically all of your post history is about using drugs (lets just ignore your own bias) are you telling me you only use the recreational dose? I also don't get why you don't think addiction is bad but you say you have lost friends to it? If drugs are just a ray of sunshine with no danger, then why did they die? \n\nHere are some articles about crime rate and drug addiction. They did not take into account just possession or use of drugs. I don't know if you can actually read them because they are behind a paywall, but I can and I can summarize the findings. http://www-tandfonline-com.libproxy.library.wmich.edu/doi/abs/10.3109/10826089809059323 .

Here is a book about meth addiction. It describes how meth addicts are more likely to be arrested for violent crime than other addicts.\n\nI don't remember where I posted how alcohol is a great drug that we should model all policy on, and the stuff you posted about doesn't make it look like we should either.

You appear to be a neo-nazi/white supremacist, if you can't see how that could effect your judgement about Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union then I don't know what to tell you. \n\nThere isn't a whole lot beyond circumstantial evidence that the Soviet Union was planning to invade Germany. They actually didn't have 25k tanks when Germany invaded. They had 15k.(Sourced from Stalin's Missed Chance by  Mikhail Meltyukhov). The reason that they had a bunch of tanks is because there was an officer named Mikhail Tukhachevsky who wanted the Soviet leadership to build lots of tanks. He wanted the Red Army to have 50k tanks, but that didn't happen.(Sourced from The Battle of the Tanks: Kursk, 1943 by Lloyd Clark) They followed some of his advice and incorporated his ideas on how modern warfare would be into the Soviet regulations for warfare. He was executed during the Purges in 1936. \n\nI do think that Stalin's purges had something to do with the war and I also know about them. If he felt that their expertise was necessary to win when Hitler invaded, then why would he get rid of them all if he was planning to invade? It does not make sense to me personally that someone preparing to invade another country would get rid of their top leadership.\n\nThe Soviets were were building defensive fortifications along their border. This was called the Molotov line and it wasn't completed when Hitler invaded. Building a defensive barrier just sound a whole lot like an offensive to me.\n\nRegarding your comment about having the tanks in case something might happen, it wasn't a might situation. The Soviets knew that Germany was eventually going to invade, it was only a matter of when. You don't really have a whole lot of evidence going for you other than \"They had a lot of tanks\".

If the USSR was planning to invade, they wouldn't have purged their entire officer corps in he lead up to the war and then when war broke out reinstate all of them.
