You could be \u201cfooled\u201d into thinking someone who looks like a cis woman has XX chromosomes, indeed, but what do you care? How do you check? In practice, what chromosomes someone has doesn\u2019t concern the vast majority of people who interact with them, except some doctors. \u201cWoman\u201d is something you are only using in a social context. So why would you use chromosomes as a definition? It\u2019s not something you will realistically need or be aware of in any situation. I doubt you even know much about chromosomes, which is not a reproach. Most people don\u2019t know beyond the bare minimum about genetics, including me. I don\u2019t think about chromosomes when interacting with people, I barely even remember how many pairs of chromosomes humans have, or what any of them do. And that\u2019s ok, because I don\u2019t need to. \n\nGender is something that very much predates the knowledge of chromosomes. Women existed in the 18th century, and people knew what they were (the definition has changed and evolved, obviously, and not even in ways you would disagree with. Back then people would have been shocked that women could wear trousers). Womanhood isn\u2019t something that suddenly popped into people\u2019s collective consciousness when chromosomes were discovered. You knew about gender before you learned about genetics in school.  \n\nChromosomes are not a good definition of gender, because, in reality, nobody gives a shit about chromosomes in real life. Not even you. The knowledge of what chromosomes are is not fundamental to social relations in the way the concept of gender is. We are getting nowhere until you realise that you don\u2019t define women by their chromosomes, you\u2019re just looking for a way to say you consider AFAB people women and not trans women, and you are latching onto chromosomes because you know everything is even less clear.\n\nAnd since you\u2019re so attached to your snake comparison: if you see a snake around, you probably find it damn well important to know whether or not it is venomous. Do you usually find yourself in a position where it is of equal or even somewhat similar urgency to find out what someone\u2019s genetic makeup is?

They\u2019re lazy, thieves, criminals, etc. I do distinctly remember one suburban, upper-middle class woman who did tell me that a Roma camp had recently set up right next to her gated community type thing, and that she felt safer since that because if there is absolutely anything that happens while they\u2019re there, they know for sure they\u2019ll be blamed for it, so they make damn well sure that nothing ever happens. \n\nIt is very much true that if anything goes missing, and there is a Roma camp nearby, they will definitely get blamed for it. It\u2019s also pretty telling that even in this relatively positive view of the Roma, it\u2019s still implied that they\u2019re violent, etc.\n\nThe Roma follow their own rules and don\u2019t act like everyone else, which is why they\u2019re distrusted (to say the least, but yeah people hate what they can\u2019t understand and I\u2019m pretty sure that\u2019s known by now), but also they\u2019re kind of seen as a symbol of freedom, with some kind of borderline fetishising envy, especially artistically and literarily. In Spain, the image of the \u201cgitano\u201d in the poems of Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca are a good example, but the idea of the gypsy as wild and free, as \u201cthe other\u201d, is pretty common in a lot of European literature and stuff.\n\nIn Spain they\u2019re also crucial for a lot of cultural traditions, especially in Andaluc\u00eda, most notably flamenco. It\u2019s actually pretty funny to see right-wing nationalists in Spain being all like \u201cwe need to defend our culture\u201d and with the next breath saying how much they hate the Roma, even though they kind of ARE an inextricable part of our culture.\n\nBasically, as a child, I learned one thing about the Roma and that is that they are Not Like Us. Which means they are to be feared, fetishised or at best treated with some kind of patronising paternalistic kind of thing. \n\nSo yeah this was an essay I shall title \u201cAn Explanation of the Roma People From Hearsay by a Spaniard Who Has Never Really Interacted With Them Much so Take With a Grain of Salt\u201d no", "created_utc": "1660406852.0", "edited": "1660407672.0", "id": "ik54vp6", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_wn8lud", "parent_id": "t1_ik4m07h", "score": "16", "subreddit": "ForwardsFromKlandma", "subreddit_id": "t5_33yph"}, {"author": "Eino54", "body": "Some people have sensitive skin and can\u2019t shower very often.", "created_utc": "1660405204.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ik50z0y", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_wn9qqi", "parent_id": "t1_ik4risn", "score": "3", "subreddit": "justneckbeardthings", "subreddit_id": "t5_2xp02"}, {"author": "Eino54", "body": "When I was quarantined for Covid (14 days) I showered maybe three times total.
