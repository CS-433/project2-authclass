Don\u2019t ever feel pressured to explain everything at once, not to your children nor to anyone who questions your prayerfully and wisely made decisions.\n\nWith that said, one way to explain exorcisms in the Gospels is through the larger context of why they are there: as a part of the narrative that Jesus has come to announce the Kingdom of God; through the healing the sick, feeding the poor, raise the dead and setting captives free because Jesus is truly God and is redeeming people from the enslavement of evil, both physically and spiritually. \n\nWhen you zoom out on the book of Mark, you\u2019ll see that the little stories (exorcisms, healings, miracles, etc) are there to fulfill what God said He would do and to prove that Jesus is exactly the Messiah prophesied. I have found that explaining the Bible in bigger picture helps. \n\nI believe exorcisms fall under \u201chealing the sick\u201d and \u201csetting captives free\u201d. I\u2019m sure these can be described in simpler words (which is unfortunately not something I\u2019m good at lol). \n\nAs for the relationship between mental health and demon possessions, we should acknowledge that we\u2019re talking about how the first-century Palestinians & Greeks tried to make sense of unexplainable, unusual symptoms of internal afflictions. A quick Google search on Hippocrates\u2019 medical concepts will show you how much of his understanding of how illnesses work will not hold up against modern medicine. We can say the same about mental illnesses. Does it mean demon possessions aren\u2019t real? Can\u2019t say no for sure. Does it mean mental illnesses are the same as demonic attacks? It would be unwise to only think of it that way. Perhaps there\u2019s a spiritual side to physical illnesses, but neither discounts the other. Personally, I\u2019m happy to think of the 2 as separate things. \n\nWe clinically know that autism and depression are not demonic attacks. Whether we choose to pray against them as if they are, is a theological decision that has little to do with the Bible itself. But to be clear: I believe we should treat mental illnesses with the best psychiatric treatments we have today, and we bring spiritual afflictions to the one true God who heals. \n\nEdit: added a few more thoughts", "created_utc": "1660464196.0", "edited": "1660478571.0", "id": "ik8al62", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_wnu5hy", "parent_id": "t3_wnu5hy", "score": "5", "subreddit": "Bible", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qqbz"}, {"author": "Jeremehthejelly", "body": "I really enjoyed spending time at Coffee and Riot, which is just outside of the building where Super Tramp is", "created_utc": "1660412739.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ik5ja08", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_wnizjt", "parent_id": "t3_wnizjt", "score": "6", "subreddit": "Prague", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qiss"}, {"author": "Jeremehthejelly", "body": "Choose from:  \nKaya on toast with 2 soft-boiled eggs\n\nRoti prata, dhal and curry gravy on the side\n\nNasi lemak with a half-boiled egg & sambal\n\nor dimsum", "created_utc": "1660299735.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ijz6n45", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_wk5pam", "parent_id": "t3_wk5pam", "score": "1", "subreddit": "askasia", "subreddit_id": "t5_3n7f3"}, {"author": "Jeremehthejelly", "body": "No. But more and more couples are doing that these days because \"it's cool\".

Sign up for an Alpha course, intro to Christianity or something similar at a local church near you. Vet the resources that they use and make sure that they come from a trustworthy author, preferably someone who went to a legit seminary. This is my first recommendation because you're rebuilding your worldview and you need to reexamine your foundation to do so.\n2. [Watch this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykH8E9wTCcQ) and dive into some of the resources that the BibleProject has to offer. The BibleProject's tagline is one that stuck with me and has helped me to really grasp what Jesus meant in John 5:39, Luke 24:44 and other similar passages: the Bible is one unified story that leads to Jesus. The Gospel is an \"easter egg\" that appears throughout the Bible, and the promise is fully unveiled in Jesus. It's all about Jesus.\n3. The BibleProject also has a podcast. Look for their Paradigm series where they talk about what the Bible is and isn't, as well as what are some helpful approaches they've taken in interpreting the Bible.\n4. Familiarize yourself with the Nicene Creed. These are the utmost basic tenets of Christianity. I find it helpful to bear the creed in mind when I'm lost in the middle of a passage that seemed so unrelated to the bigger story of the Bible.\n5.

We all have doubts, and it's helpful to have someone work them out with you in person.\n\nLastly, keep reading the Bible and learn how to read it.

Having faith in God and believing that He will answer our prayers are 2 related but different things. \n\nHere's a simple definition of what a Biblical perspective of faith is, according to Biblical scholar David Campbell: \n\n>\"Faith is the right and proper response of sinful, fallen humanity to a holy, saving God.\"\n\nAnother scholar, Michael Heiser, simply defined faith as laid out in the Bible as \"believing loyalty\". Believing what, you ask? Believing in the God of the Bible and remaining loyal to Him no matter the cost, no matter the circumstances, no matter what His answer to your prayer is (someone once cheekily told me, \"God answers every prayer, and sometimes the answer is 'No').\n\n**Faith in the Bible is** less about our prayers answered and more **about** **believing in God's plan to redeem those who choose to follow His ways and sticking with it till your dying breath**.

Calvinism emphasizes that God chose us.\n\nAnd the other corner is Arminianism, which believes that through God's grace, we are empowered to choose Him. Arminianism places an emphasis on our responsibility to choose Him.\n\nI said \"spectrum\" because there is a mixture of views in between. I've yet to meet anyone who's 100% Calvinist nor 100% Arminian.\n\nThe answer I'm satisfied with is that God chooses us and we choose God, aka both views are not mutually exclusive. We won't fully understand how this is possible, but with God all things are possible. Yes, He has foreknowledge of who will choose Him. And yes, we are given the opportunity to choose Him also. Ultimately, Jesus was the elect and through Him, we are able to respond to His call. We don't have to know how He saves, our responsibility is based on the fact that He saves.\n\nSome resources for you:  \n[Predestination or Free-Will?

Would you share with us what led you to this conclusion?\n\nIt's important to notice the difference between \"titles\" and \"Personhood.\" It is true that throughout time God has referred to Himself with a variety of titles, like the Lion of Judah, El Shaddai, Yahweh Rapha, Yahweh Tsidkenu, Shepherd, Angel of God and so on. But they're not the same as Personhood. \n\nIt's like saying I box like Ali, I can write like Hemingway, I'm strong like Eddie Hall. But at the end of the day, those are not who I am. They are analogies of facets of my being, and when I unveil myself to you, you'll see my true person.\n\nThe phrase Trinity is not spelt out in the Bible, that's true. It was coined later on after the early church fathers and various Church councils have established what it means that The Father, Son, and Spirit are One. And this last bit is particularly important (\"are One\"): it means that we worship one God with 3 Godheads.\n\nOkay, so we've established that there's a difference between using titles to refer to oneself and personhood. But what if you're unsure about the whole Three Persons thing? Before I attempt to answer this, I must preface by saying that the understanding of God and Trinity toes the line between what is revealed and what is mysterious to us. We rely on Scripture and the conclusions of the bishops and theologians who lived in a time much closer to Jesus' to stay on the path of orthodoxy (sound doctrine). Any theory that we have that the early Church rejected requires significant proof of evidence, if not to be rejected as well. With that said!   \nLet's start with Scripture. The earliest explicit mention of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit in one sentence is probably Matthew 28:19:\n\n>\"Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit,...\"\n\nIf we read Genesis 1 and John 1 side-by-side (John pretty much fills into Genesis in light of the revelation of the Son), we'll be informed that only 3 persons have been involved at the beginning of creation. The Father is God, the Son was the Word, the Spirit was the Spirit. \n\nWithin the same century, Paul used similar phrasing as a doxological formula to end his letter to the Corinthians in 2 Corinthians 13:\n\n>\"The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, the love of God, and the communion of the Holy Spirit be with all of you.\"\n\nSo though not explicit, we would say that the establishment of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit as ONE God \u2014 no matter how many other titles or analogies were used to refer to the Godheads \u2014 has been well established within the 1st century itself.\n\nFurthermore, the earliest \"new Christians manual\" we have today also laid out the necessary invocation of the three Godheads in baptism:\n\n>\"After the foregoing instructions, baptize in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, in living \\[running\\] water\u2026. If you have neither, pour water three times on the head, in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.\" \u2014 Didache 7:1\n\nThe phrase Trinity is not spelt out in the Bible, that's true. It was coined later on after the early church fathers and various Church councils have established what it means that The Father, Son, and Spirit are One. And this last bit is particularly important (\"are One\"): it means that we worship one God with 3 Godhead.\n\nTheophilus of Antioch, the Patriarch of the Church of Antioch (169 AD - 182 AD) wrote this:\n\n>\"Since then the Word establishes, that is to say, gives body and grants the reality of being, and the Spirit gives order and form to the diversity of the powers; rightly and fittingly is the Word called the Son, and the Spirit the Wisdom of God.\"\n\nFinally, we arrive at the Council of Nicea in 325 AD. I say \"finally\" because everything that follows regarding the doctrine of Trinity came out of this landmark event in Church History. Here's how GotQuestions.org described the CoN:\n\n>\"At the Council of Nicea, Emperor Constantine presided over a group of church bishops and other leaders with the purpose of defining the nature of God for all of Christianity and eliminating confusion, controversy, and contention within the church. The Council of Nicea overwhelmingly affirmed the deity and eternality of Jesus Christ and defined the relationship between the Father and the Son as \u201cof one substance.\u201d It also affirmed the Trinity\u2014the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit were listed as three co-equal and co-eternal Persons.\"\n\nThis Council is where we got the Nicene Creed from. Not unlike today, countless heresies abound in the first few centuries of Christianity. The Nicene Creed was formulated as a measure for orthodoxy in the whole body of Christ. You can even use this today when you're unsure about someone's beliefs. Just ask them if they affirm this 2000-year-old creed and you'll immediately root out all the well-known cults today.\n\nTo conclude, the earliest form of Christianity is creedal and confessional, which means we only need to affirm and stick to what has been established and we'll be safe doctrinally. This is by design because most believers in the first century were illiterate; the discussions about Trinity largely didn't concern the laity at all. People just wanted to know what to believe, and the creeds meant that as long as they believe these things then they're Christians.\n\nFor us today, Christianity is a communal belief that stretches across time and place; we are all a part of one universal and apostolic church and we rely on each other to function as the Bride of Christ. And in the case of the Trinity and other core doctrines, we get to rely on the writings of prolific Christian thinkers who lived much closer to the time of Jesus or were even discipled by the Apostles themselves.

The running themes and specifically selected phrases established in Genesis carry theological significance far more than someone approaching it \"scientifically\" would appreciate.\n2. You quoted 2 Timothy 3:16-17 wrong. \"Inerrancy\" is a much later concept in Christianity. While it's fine if you want to believe the Bible to be inerrant, it's important to clarify that it's a theological conclusion rather than something explicitly written in the Scriptures.

The Bible itself is a document designed to explain a worldview. Discipleship was a huge deal throughout the Bible; prophets trained up proteges, scribes and priests passed down their roles, Jesus Himself called disciples and trained them to make more disciples. Most universities were founded by Christians.\n\nEphesians 4:23 is my standard answer for whenever people ask about the role of the mind and knowledge in Christianity. The truth is, we're all being discipled every day. Some of us contemplate and study the Bible rigorously everyday. Some of us only open up ye ol dusty book once a week but would happily devour 1 self-help book and podcast a day. And I suspect even more of us spend more time on social media than we do in prayer. The question is, who and what is discipling you? Are they discipling you more than the Bible is?\n\nWith that said, I also believe that all truth is God's truth. Is it true that guys who dress well, are well-read, have stable income sources and are kind are far more attractive? Of course. Is it true that you can learn secret seduction tactics that will make girls fall for you? I have yet to come across something like that that aren't scams but even if we assume that they're true, will you consider the morality of using disingenuous tactics just to get someone to call you back?\n\nBut how can you determine what appears to be true is God's truths? Even if you're a modern monastic monk, you'll still run into topics that are way above your paygrade or biases. That is why I personally would say we should always start with familiarizing ourselves with the written, tried-and-true knowledge of God before we explore elsewhere.\n\n[Paul also wrote in 1 Corinthians 6:12 about the freedom a Christian has](https://www.gotquestions.org/everything-is-permissible.html). In the context of the entire Bible, however, it's important to understand that the freedom we now have is not the freedom to do anything we want. Rather, the freedom we have is the freedom to worship God. And a righteous God deserves right worship, lest we offer up strange fire to God.\n\nSo whatever the Bible doesn't talk about explicitly, ask yourself:\n\n1. Does it contradict the Bible?\n2. What does the Holy Spirit tell me through conscience, wise people around me, and my church elders?\n3. Does doing or thinking this way help me to glorify God?\n\nEdit: Added an extra pointer", "created_utc": "1646042209.0", "edited": "1646043097.0", "id": "hyreo0b", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_t29sem", "parent_id": "t3_t29sem", "score": "1", "subreddit": "Bible", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qqbz"}, {"author": "Jeremehthejelly", "body": ">https://youtu.be/bqAVAJmfYAQ?t=759\n\nThank you so much!

But the God of all, being one really and indeed and true, is faithful, who is ever the same\u2026. He is ever the same and unchanging, deceiving neither in his essence nor in his promise. As again says the apostle writing to the Thessalonians, \u201cFaithful is he who calls you, who also will do it\u201d; for in doing what he promises, he is faithful to his words. And he thus writes to the Hebrews as to the word\u2019s meaning \u201cunchangeable\u201d: \u201cIf we believe not, yet he abides faithful; he cannot deny himself.\u201d\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAugustine of Hippo (AD 430):\n\n>\"The only thing the Almighty cannot do is what he does not will, in case anybody should consider it was very rash of me to say that the Almighty \u201ccannot\u201d do something. The blessed apostle said it too, \u201cIf we do not believe, he remains faithful, for he cannot deny himself.\u201d But it is because he does not wish to that he cannot do it, because he cannot even have the will to. Justice, after all, cannot have the will to do what is unjust, or wisdom will what is foolish, or truth will what is false.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGeorge Leo Haydock (AD 1849):\n\n>\"If we believe not; i.e. if we refuse to believe in God, or if after having believed, we depart from our faith, the Almighty still continues faithful; he is still what he was. Our believing in him cannot increase his glory, nor can our disbelief in him cause any diminution thereof, since it is already infinite. (Estius) The sense may be: when we renounce God, and refuse to believe in him, will he be less powerful to punish us? or, will his menaces be less true or less efficacious? He will effect his work without us, for he will infallibly bring about the salvation of his elect.

Joy that cannot be expressed in words; yet the voice expresses what is conceived within and cannot be explained verbally; this is jubilation.\"\n\nA more modern commentator, David Guzik, wrote this on the verse [Romans 8:26](https://enduringword.com/bible-commentary/romans-8/):\n\n>\"The idea is simply of communication beyond our ability to express. The deep groanings within us cannot be articulated apart from the interceding work of the Holy Spirit. This, of course, is the purpose of the gift of tongues \u2013 to enable us to communicate with God in a manner that is not limited to our own knowledge or ability to articulate our heart before God. The purpose of tongues is not to prove that we are \u201cfilled with the Spirit\u201d or to prove that we are especially spiritual.\"\n\nSo I don't see a problem with praying, groaning, anguishing, crying out loud to God in your private prayers whether it's in an unknown or known tongue, nor will I impose any particular view on anyone.

For the past 2000 years (and even longer if we count faithful God worshippers before Jesus came), people drew near to God through these means:\n\n1. Regular private prayers\n2. Regularly gathering with other believers to sing and hear the Scriptures read aloud\n3. Studying the Scriptures\n4. Meditating/contemplating on the Scriptures\n5. Being a loving, charitable, and generous neighbor\n\nSometimes we hyperspiritualize what it means to know God or have a personal relationship with God. Many great theologians have gone before us without ever claiming to have heard an audible voice of God, and that's okay! God has already given us the Bible. Some have cheekily said, \"if you want to hear God, read the Bible. If you want to hear Him audibly, read it out loud.\" I'm not saying that people can't ever hear God's audible voice, but God's primary communication with us is through His written word. Christ spoke about this in [John 14:15-17](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+14%3A15-17&version=CSB).\n\nFind wise counsel in your life and don't frown when wisdom comes from your least fav person in church. God speaks to us through the wisdom of a Godly community. Speak to your pastors, elders and other older folks.\n\nIt's also important to briefly touch on God's will. We can categorize God's will into 2 kinds: specific will and general will. \"Specific will\" refers to those where God gives clear directives, eg. be a missionary in Middle East, give a certain amount to a cause, get out of a dangerous situation that they didn't know about, etc. \"General will\" refers to what God has commanded all of us to generally do, eg. Love Him and love your neighbor as yourself. \n\nNowhere in the Bible does it say that we should wait on God to tell us what to eat, wear or what new revelation does He have for us today. Again, \"specific will\" isn't God's primary communication with us. He made us with wisdom and a sound mind to be responsible for our own actions and prayerfully make wise decisions in order to partner with Him in expanding His Kingdom.\n\nAlso, not every problem can be solved with prayer. But with prayer, you can begin to tackle problems.\n\nIf you'd like to learn more about what I've said, get a copy of the book \"Hearing God: Eliminate Myths.

College isn't easy on its own, and having the experience challenge our faith makes it all the more difficult.\n\nThankfully, our faith boils down to one simple fact: if we remain loyal to believing that Jesus is the Son of God and there is no other way for us to be saved except through Him, we will be saved. You may have heard this in the form of the phrasing \"saved by grace alone through faith alone\" or \"sola fide\". Nothing secures your salvation apart from you believing that Jesus Christ is the only true God who saves you.\n\nWith that said, here are some resources for you to start researching and hopefully help build your faith:\n\n1. Sign up for [theosu.ca](https://theosu.ca) and take the courses Battle for The Bible, Critical Theory II and Defense Against The Dark Arts. They outline everything that counters the critical, postmodern narrative about Christianity that you will commonly find in non-Christian institutions. Take up Decoding Deconstructionism too if you have the time. These courses are too long for me to summarize here.\n2. You listed a lot of deeds that are indeed commendable, but if I may ask, who are you doing them for? What do you think they will achieve, and what makes you think that you need to do them? Did it come out of faith, or are you hoping to merit faith?\n3. Listen to [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaqKzYJ151Y) to learn how Christian Biblical scholars view the making of the Bible. You may have been reading from critical views. There is more than one way to think of how the Bible came to be, and no one has a corner on truth. But the Holy Spirit has been guiding the making of the Bible since day 1 and He didn't abandon the process. What man meant for evil, God meant for good.\n4. Learn the Creeds that Christians have affirmed before there was even a Bible: the Apostles' Creed, Nicene Creed, Athanasian Creed and Chalcedonian Creed. Catechism I on TheosU walks you through them. These Creeds outline the core doctrines that must not, cannot, and will not change no matter what denomination you are a part of, or whatever discovery about the Bible comes out tomorrow.\n\nI hope you will consider my suggestions on where to go from here.

When a 2022 person says \"historical\", we meant that something literally happened and it was written down as it happened. The 1st-century Jewish understanding of what \"historical\" means is much richer than that. \n\nTo them, the OT was also a prophetic library, hymn book, wisdom literature, source of identity, the foundation of the various types of laws and rituals, and other less prominent cultural practices of that time. **It was not just literal history, it was a worldview.**\n\nIt's not wrong to say that Jesus and his contemporaries took the OT as *literal history,* but to say that is all it was to them would be an unhelpful way to fully appreciate and understand the Bible as a whole.\n\n1 Corinthians 15, as you have cited, is a good example: Paul was not simply describing the history of mankind, in the context of the v.35-49, he was also making a theological point about the resurrection to come (hence v.44 before it and \"...the last Adam, a life-giving spirit\" in the second half of v.45).

Asking questions is a huge part of the journey to faith and nobody should ever be shamed for earnestly seeking answers.\n\nYour question will lead to a broad range of answers; I see that you have asked for specific doctrinal pointers in other comments. I'll try to give you a few pointers so you can read further on your own, otherwise this wall of text will be unbearable.\n\nLet's start with divine revelation. We believe that Christianity is a revealed religion. Christians believe that everything we know about Christianity has been revealed by God (RC Sproul 1992, Essential Truths of the Christian Faith). Like a friend or a colleague, you know them by what they reveal about themselves and what you can observe.\n\nHow is God like according to His revelation to us? God is the creator and sustainer of all things (Psalm 86:8\u201310, 15). [God has revealed Himself to be one in essence and 3 in person](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAvYmE2YYIU&t=232s). This is the first doctrine about God that we must affirm in order to be a Christian, as outlined in the [Apostle's Creed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostles%27_Creed), one of the 3 big creeds that Christians have held for the past 2000 years. Throughout known time and as recorded in the Bible, God has revealed Himself to us in 3 ways: as the Father, the Son (Jesus), and the Holy Spirit.\n\nNow to more specifically address \"how should a Christian view God,\" we have to look at what's the central story of Christianity and how Christians should view themselves.\n\nWhat is the central story of Christianity? This is an outline of what we commonly call the Gospel aka the Good News:\n\n1. God, the rightful King of the world, created everything and made humans in his own image to know him, love him, live with him, and glorify him.\n2. Humanity was deceived into rebelling and becoming kings over one another.\n3. God promised to show His mercy through forgiveness and renewal by reconciling Himself with humanity.\n4. He did this by coming in the form of Jesus Christ. Jesus died for our sins, rose again after defeating evil and became King once again.\n5. Since then, all who believe in Jesus are adopted into His Kingdom and are tasked with expanding His Kingdom through the Jesus way, as we partner with Him to renew the world until Jesus returns to be our King forever. And in His new world, there will be no more death, sorrow, pain, and crying (Revelation 21:4)\n\nIn light of this good news, how should a Christian view their relationship to God?\n\nMy personal favorite way of viewing who Christians are to God is that we are His Royal Priests (1 Peter 2:9). Christians are to worship God through their every action and intention. Christians are to show God's love through tangible ways to the world around us, because priests are effectively ambassadors of God to the people, tasked to reconcile the world with God (2 Corinthians 5:20). [This video will explain to you further how the theme of God's Royal Priesthood can be found on the very first page of the Bible](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60TAYja110).\n\nAs Royal Priests of God, how should Christians view God?\n\nWe view Him as the God who redeemed and is still redeeming the whole world so that one day, all who endure with belief in Him will have their deepest desire fulfilled: the desire to be reconciled with God forever. We view Him as loving, compassionate, patient and faithful. He loves us by sending Jesus to be our way of reconciling with Him (John 3:16). He showed His compassion through the works of Jesus as recorded in the eyewitness accounts of Matthew, Mark, Luke and John. He is patiently waiting for as many people as possible to choose Him, no matter how long it takes. (Revelation 6:11) He is faithful, because He said He will redeem us from darkness since the beginning of human history (Genesis 3:15) and He did. He said He'll forgive and He is still forgiving today. (Romans 5:9-11). He said He will right all wrongs one day, and we believe He will.\n\n\\--\n\nFor further reading, in recommended order:\n\n* BibleProject.com\n* The Apostle's Creed and the Nicene Creed\n* New City Catechism\n* Essential Truths of the Christian Faith by RC Sproul\n* Evangelical Theology by Michael Bird\n* The Day The Revolution Began by NT Wright (advanced material)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n(edit: order of further reading)", "created_utc": "1642400712.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ht0bdg0", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_s5tj41", "parent_id": "t3_s5tj41", "score": "2", "subreddit": "Bible", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qqbz"}, {"author": "Jeremehthejelly", "body": "Thanks for sharing vulnerably with us strangers on the internet. If you ask 3 people which church to attend, they'll very likely give you 3 different answers. So here are some suggestions:\n\n1. Assuming that you've found a church to baptize your child, would you consider attending that church for a while and get a feel of them? Join their services, hang around to get to know the people there, sign up for any intro to Christianity courses that they have. Talk to someone who looks like they work/volunteer at the church and I'm sure they'll be more than happy to answer your questions.\n2. Visit a couple of churches around you and see if you like any of them. Google every church you plan to visit. If they have a guest lounge, talk to the people there and ask them what they believe. All true Christian churches affirm the Nicene Creed and some form of later confessions (Westminster's Confessions, 5 Solas, Baptist Confessions, 39 Articles, etc). Some nondenominational churches have their own statements of faith, learn about them and compare them with the Nicene Creed.\n3. It would be very helpful to learn about some of the denominations you've come across. Get a quick crash course on Church History and learn about denominations. Christianity is more diverse than we realize. [Here's a quick start](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mnq_kiQicnE).\n4. Join any intro to Christianity courses in the churches that you visit. They come under many labels, like Catechism, Alpha Course, Christianity Explored, 20 Christian Beliefs, New Believers' Class, Sunday School, etc. Just ask the people in that church.\n5.

You can achieve this by using the historical-grammatical method and the historical-critical method. Some people like to pit these 2 methods of examining Scripture against each other, but Bible scholars and theologians often use them hand in hand. \n\nChurch Tradition also gives us a glimpse of how bishops and scholars have interpreted the Bible for the past 2000 years and that's a very valuable resource as well.

Undeniable. Do they advance church technology like sound systems, apps and software, and how modern churches can run services more effectively? Absolutely. Do they see the spiritual gifts operating more than any other denomination? You bet.   \nAre they right about women leadership? If you have a Charismatic hermeneutical POV, then they're right.\n\nThe CoE ordain women. Have they produced some of the most prominent scholars and theologians that most Christians know by name? Absolutely. Are they upholding certain practices that modern churches have largely forgotten? Yes. Do they fund many Biblical scholarships and other Christian-related researches for the benefit of all believers? For sure.   \nAre they right about women leadership? If you have a CoE hermeneutical POV, then they're right. Certain Anglican churches don't ordain women, and that's okay too.  \n\n\nMy point is, you will find absolutely amazing Bible-based churches that do ordain women as well as equally fantastic Bible-based churches that don't.

I\u2019ll try to only unpack the ones in your title\n\n1. The reality of something doesn\u2019t hinge on a person\u2019s belief of its existence. This is known as phenomenological transcendence. You can say a tree isn\u2019t real all day, but if you drive a car right into it at full speed, you will experience its realness in a very unforgiving way. However, to demonstrate how our salvation is really not something we can earn, belief, or rather faith is at the end of the day the only requirement to be grafted into God\u2019s Kingdom. Without getting too tangled up in soteriology, here\u2019s an imperfect analogy: Christ offered free coffee to everyone. All you gotta do is walk into Faith Cafe and put it on his tab. Upon hearing this good news, your friend said aloud, \u201cThere\u2019s no such thing as free coffee in this world. Heck, I bet this Christ guy doesn\u2019t even exist\u201d. Is anyone to blame that your friend didn\u2019t redeem their free coffee?\n\n2. About \u201cgoing to heaven\u201d\u2026 This is a Platonized version of Christianity. Yes, heaven is God\u2019s throne according to the Bible. Yes, we commune with Jesus in paradise before His second coming. But Christianity was never about going to heaven \u2014 being a Christian means believing that one day Jesus will come back to earth, He will renew this entire realm with the new heavens and the new earth, all who died persevering in faith will be resurrected and be reunited with God right here on earth forevermore. That\u2019s the Biblical ending of this world, and the beginning of the next in eternity.\n\nEdit: wording", "created_utc": "1638464590.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hmyaa7m", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_r79g6a", "parent_id": "t3_r79g6a", "score": "6", "subreddit": "Bible", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qqbz"}, {"author": "Jeremehthejelly", "body": "1 month\u2019s paid trip to Iceland.

Some would be similar to what the others here have mentioned:\n\n1. Come up with a full campaign. It can be something you're working on at the moment. Let's say your class assignment is to create only a poster for an exhibition. On your own, you can design the whole package (business cards, website mockups, logo) and compile it in your portfolio. Your lecturer doesn't have to know about it, but you can always show him/her to display dedication and passion.\n\n2. Your identity is a campaign itself. Every job interview you will attend is a pitch. So brand yourself..! Come up with a campaign for yourself. Some students overlook this, but it really helps.\n\n3. Toe on the lines of what a Creative Director would do. Show strategies, storyboards, thumbnails and initial visuals in your portfolio. Don't just show a picture of you at the finishing line.. show how you got there. The blood and sweat poured into every campaign (or single works). Demonstrate that you have the abilities to direct the entire concept behind your artwork series.\n\n4. You mentioned that they didn't teach you guys *how* to create good looking compositions. I think it's the same in every design school. Absorb creativity every morning on your own, check Pinterest often and make your own boards. Also, check out From Up North. Just absorb all those inspirational designs and when you need it, you will remember it. [Don Draper's wise words](http://zachwaugh.me/posts/think-about-it-deeply-and-forget-it/).\n\nThat's all I can think of now. I love your artworks btw, you should put them on behance too. Also, I paid a visit to your linkedin.
