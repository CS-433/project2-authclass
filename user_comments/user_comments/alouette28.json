They were obviously German Nazi camps, which happened to be located on the pre-war and current Polish territory.\n\nWhen it comes to being afraid of being vilified, as you suggest, sadly I have to agree here. They are scared to death of it because they cannot accept the fact that we are not the heroic Christ of Nations they like to portray us as. We are as flawed as any other nation and sometimes we were and are a bunch of right pieces of crap. They can\u2019t deal with the fact that there were and are antisemites around us because it would expose their own hidden antisemitism and their nationalism and insecurity.

Better than it used to be, I guess I'm making progress but there is a long road ahead and I have a feeling that I'm getting worse.\n\nThere are still issues I'm not able to deal with, no matter how hard I try.\n\nI very often feel like my emotions and thoughts control me instead of me controlling them, and I often have a feeling that my anxiety about everything is getting out of hand - I can stress about almost anything, invent all kinds of doomsday scenarios which have 0% chance of happening and forget about what's actually going on.. I just don't know how to turn my head off and stop thinking about the same thing over and over again. \n\nAnother thing is (and I'm afraid will always be) my self-esteem, self-worth and other self-... things. I just can't trust myself 100%. I keep second guessing myself and whatever I do I keep thinking \"what if what I'm doing it wrong?\", \"what if they will notice?\" etc. etc., depending on circumstances. I just don't believe that I'm good enough in anything, really, even at work, I'm quite good at my job and I like it but I always feel that I'm not good enough and that they will notice it soon so every mistake I make feels like a confirmation of it and I wait for (in my mistaken opinion) the inevitable \"sorry we'll have to let you go\" talk. \n\nIt's not just about work, obviously. For example, I'm in a very happy relationship but I still feel like I'm not good enough and that my boyfriend will get fed up with my constant anxiety and problems and will leave me for someone more sane - he has never said it and has never made any gesture suggesting he was about to leave me for any reason. He is more than willing to talk to me and help me (and I must say he has already helped me a great deal) but I sometimes feel awkward when I'm upset and I want to talk to him because I just don't want to bother him with another silly problem I blew out of proportion. \n\nI must say I generally don't trust my own feelings, I have been upset about so many insignificant things that now whenever I feel bad I just think that I'm just being unreasonable again.\n\nAnd I just don't see anything special about myself, I don't see myself as unique in any way. If someone asked me if I like myself, I wouldn't know what to say. I tolerate myself, yes, and I know I'm not a horrible person, but I can't say I like myself. I've never done, to be honest. I have always seen myself as average at best, and even though I have tried many times, I have no idea how to change it.  \n\nSo I just try to draw as little attention to myself as possible, I prefer to be in the background and being the centre of attention (for any reason, I don't like it very much even if it's positive) is a nightmare. And I prefer to give than to receive. Which combined with my fear of being rejected (thanks, school years, I'm still terrified of being labelled as the odd one out) is probably a recipe for a disaster and a pushover. And a reason why I still struggle with all kinds of banter or jokes directed at me, I tend to read them literally, even though rationally I know that they are only jokes.\n\nSo to sum up, the mess in my head is getting worse and worse. And I'm considering talking to a psychologist if not a psychotherapist. Whoever it will be, they will have a source of income for the rest of their life, I assume.\n\nTL; DR - Not horrible, but I feel that it's getting worse and I'm considering talking to a psychotherapist. \n\n*As all non-natives say, English is not my first language so sorry for any mistakes.", "created_utc": "1597924786.0", "edited": "False", "id": "g27di67", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_id0iv2", "parent_id": "t3_id0iv2", "score": "1", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i"}, {"author": "alouette28", "body": "Br\u00f6ther may I have some dr\u00fcgs", "created_utc": "1597480684.0", "edited": "False", "id": "g1jwjd8", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_ia1ev6", "parent_id": "t1_g1jqckm", "score": "4", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i"}, {"author": "alouette28", "body": "I'm in relocation industry.
