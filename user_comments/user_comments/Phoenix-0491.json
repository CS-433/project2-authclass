A phonotactics problem as well, you just said.\n\nBuilding an auxlang should start thinking about the most common sounds in languages. Besides that, the phonology is an easy task compared to other features. Some native speakers find easy, for example, the absence of tense and live only with the grammaticalization of the aspect, while others can't live without them and find aspect and mood very difficult to define. The derivational morphology vary greatly among languages and some languages has no necessity to define a derivation for something, such as a tool or a tendency.\n\nThose are only few examples. Conlanging an auxlang means to choose which features, or group of them, to insert in your auxlang, so you are inevitably going to choose a more \"european approach\", or a more semitic approach, a more chinese ecc... or a clumsy mixture of european lexicon and agglutinative features.
