The idea of this deep in love album in the beginning, then goes into this dark-esque rap songs. The whole vibe Trippie was intentionally going for was executed well.

I\u2019m not sure what Tripp was doin with that one, should\u2019ve been a Busta single with a Trippie feat but that def wouldn\u2019t fly. Majority of the songs I can replay over and over. \n\nOverall what really stands out for me, this album had a lot of feeling, and me personally it\u2019s hard for me to be in touch with my emotions. I can blast this late at night in the car and scream every lyric. I only skip \u201cI Got You.\u201d And I probably played \u201cPersonal Favorite\u201d too many times, but it just doesn\u2019t get old. Compared to the other albums, I skip songs more often. I have 156 Trippie Songs  on my rotation playlist, so it\u2019s not like I ONLY listen to Pegasus.

I have been out of the closet on and off since I was 15 but my mom kept telling me \u201cit was a phase\u201d so I feel like I would just sleep with guys to compensate for that. I have had romantic sex but I just lacked a connection and was very uninterested. I\u2019ve always saw myself with a wife, and could never see myself marrying a man. And actually the college I go to everyone has a high body count in the 40\u2019s range so I\u2019m really not considered a slut lmao", "created_utc": "1564847672.0", "edited": "False", "id": "evvuhfy", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_clk16u", "parent_id": "t1_evvu97u", "score": "0", "subreddit": "AMA", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r4eo"}, {"author": "drowsyokaga", "body": "1. Yes and no. I feel like I would become really good friends with a guy, and I would confuse that thought with the idea that I liked them. I liked them as a friend but I knew sex was kinda something that people just did. After sex I would just feel gross, not really a connection or anything. I don\u2019t really think I was into it tbh. \n\n2. Same-sex relationship- yes, I just got out of one with my now ex-girlfriend but it was the best one yet. I finally felt comfortable in my own skin, and was finally happy with who I was. She made me feel everything good about myself and helped me realize who I wanted to be. \n\n3. I actually just got out of a 6 month relationship with a girl and I came out to my entire family with her and they were all very supportive! I actually came out when I was 15 to my mom but she thought it was \u201cjust a phase\u201d which made me think it was \u201cjust a phase\u201d as well.\n\n4. I\u2019ve known I was gay my whole life, I just didn\u2019t know how to express that idea. Where I grew up there were a good amount of gay guys but not really any lesbians. I pretty much had to be the guinea pig. I moved in high schools so I was out of the closet at my 1st high school (9th-11th grade) but then \u201cstraight\u201d at my second one. (11th-12th grade) since I thought it was just a phase.\n\nedit: re- answered question 2", "created_utc": "1564847237.0", "edited": "1564847508.0", "id": "evvtvx4", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_clk16u", "parent_id": "t1_evvt41t", "score": "1", "subreddit": "AMA", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r4eo"}, {"author": "drowsyokaga", "body": "Over the course of 2 years.

Like I said earlier, the goal is through capitalism leads to financial success. Most republicans agree on an \u201cAmerican dream\u201d mindset where we can work hard and climb the ladder to success.

That\u2019s what I look for when voting for a president.
