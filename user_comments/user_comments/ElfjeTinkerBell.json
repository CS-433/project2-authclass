Well at least that solves problem 1 as without meds I cannot work.\n4. The whole gun thing scares me.\n5. And the abortion discussion scares me as well - especially since medically unavoidable abortion is discussed as well.\n6. Why do you think 1-2h commutes are reasonable? Within 4 hours I can reach pretty much every place in my whole country!\n7. Why do you guys have a minimum wage if it's not the minimum you get paid? Also why can't you live from a minimum wage job?\n8. I read about sick days sometimes. I usually don't really plan on being ill so I have no idea how to make sure I don't go over a certain amount of days?\n9. Do you guys even get paid time off? Or maternity leave? And for the other parent?\n10. Added: please just give me the price in the shop. You can do the math for taxes, I don't want to.\n11. And on the topic of taxes - it seems like doing taxes takes a lot of work and keeping track of purchases etc. From what I've heard it's very confusing and difficult.\n12. Let me add one more. Discrimination. I'm not at all saying the Netherlands is discrimination-free. But what I'm hearing from the US is much worse than what I've experienced here. In the Netherlands, as long as you are reasonably polite (both in words and in things like weapons), you can be pretty much sure the police won't kill you. If you're locked up, you do have access to necessary medication. It's far from perfect, but from what I hear still wayyyy better than the US.\n\nThere's probably a lot more I'm missing right now...", "created_utc": "1654543480.0", "edited": "1654588907.0", "id": "ibego9j", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_v67mav", "parent_id": "t3_v67mav", "score": "13", "subreddit": "AskEurope", "subreddit_id": "t5_2uayg"}, {"author": "ElfjeTinkerBell", "body": "Yep!

In the Netherlands, I use a public transport app on my phone which tells me this (don't remember for the UK). This tells me roughly whether I have to hurry or not (I'll let someone from the UK chime in on this what rules of thumb you can use).\n\nWhen I get out of the train, I try to follow where most people go as that's usually the right direction. If people split up, I randomly choose something and hope for the best. If there's no crowd to follow, I'll look for signs that point to other platforms, a central hall, etc. If I also don't see signs I'll just go somewhere and hope for the best. Yes, chances are you'll end up at a dead end. In that case, just turn around and go the other way. Every day there's tons of people visiting train stations they've not seen before so it's not weird to have to search.\n\nAt some point I'll come across signs for the platforms (some stations only have those in the central hall). I'll follow those and they will lead me to the platform I need.\n\nWhat to do with the extra time? It's perfectly normal to sit or stand somewhere and play on your phone. You could also visit the shops, have a snack (assuming you're allowed with COVID rules), or - especially if there's quite some time to fill - go find a waiting room and read a book or play on your phone or on a game device or whatever. \n\nI hope this helps and feel free to ask for details or whatever I've forgotten to write about.", "created_utc": "1647200081.0", "edited": "False", "id": "i0j03a8", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_tdcvmi", "parent_id": "t3_tdcvmi", "score": "10", "subreddit": "Explainlikeimscared", "subreddit_id": "t5_2xiog"}, {"author": "ElfjeTinkerBell", "body": ">It doesn\u2019t matter how often you feed your cat, only that the meals add up to a daily amount.\n\nThis.
