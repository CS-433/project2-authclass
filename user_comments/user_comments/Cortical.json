Why fight windmills?\n\n>Does that make it objectively the correct definition?\n\nAll words are made up. There is no god given objective truth. The correct definition is always the one that the native speakers of a language collectively decide it is.\n\nImagine you're tasked with cataloguing a language that hasn't been written down before, and you create a dictionary. How do you decide what definition you put for each word? You go ask the people that speak the language, and put the definition that they collectively agree on. You're not going to go and find the oldest speakers and ask them how their grandparents used to use that word.\n\nAnd if you really want to do the pointless exercise of looking at the terms \"1st/2nd/3rd world\" objectively. Let's look at it. 1st/2nd/3rd implies some kind of order. How exactly does that make sense in describing a bipolar world with a nonaligned camp? Why is one power block designated 1st and the other 2nd? what are they 1st and 2nd of? why are they not 2nd and 1st? What makes the nonaligned collectively 3rd? why are the nonaligned powers not 1st? Historically the nonaligned powers often ended up between the two power blocks, so wouldn't it make more sense to have them in the middle, i.e. 2nd? Objectively it makes absolutely no sense.\n\nNo let's look at the contemporary definitions.\n1st world are developed countries, 3rd world are undeveloped countries, 2nd world could arguably be developing countries. There's a clear ranking of development. from highest to lowest, with 2 arbitrary thresholds to decide if a country falls in 1st or 2nd or in 2nd or 3rd. It makes sense objectively. It's maybe not ideal, and not very descriptive (which is why we typically use \"developed\", \"developing\" and \"least developed\" or some such instead), it just makes way more sense than the original definition.\n\nSo much for \"objectively correct\"\n\n>You are trying to prove to me that's is totally cool\n\nIt's not just \"totally cool\", it's baked into the fabric of our being. It's part of our DNA. Why do you think teenagers across all cultures have their own slangs? They're instinctively compelled to change the language of their parents. Experiment with it, coin new words, reduce grammatical complexity here, add new complexity there. I'd argue that trying to fight that tooth and nail is not only pointless, it's harmful. It goes against human nature.\n\n>Not to mention that these terms are pretty offensive and have some problematic implications with grading the world in categories like that, where the people who assigned those grades and who use those terms are conveniently the \"first\" category.\n\nI'm generally all for political correctness, but this is just a big load of hogwash. Ask any immigrant from a \"3rd world country\" to a \"1st world country\" which country is objectively better to live in. There's a reason they migrated. Classifying countries with good infrastructure, a cohesive social fabric, good social security and mobility, low corruption ect. ect. as the \"first\" category of a development grading isn't nor should it be offensive. In fact making a huge hullabaloo out of it is belittling the people living in the \"third\" category of this ranking, by implying that their shitty living situation is somehow not objectively worse than the luxury we live in. They hate it themselves and dream of the luxury we have.
