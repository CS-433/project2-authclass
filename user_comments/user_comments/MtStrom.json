It\u2019s a take that can justifiably be patched up in a contemporary adaptation. The show could have gone the way of portraying those factions in a better light of course, but that too would have caused an outrage due to not being lore-accurate and what not.\n\n>\tIt\u2019s prejudiced because out of all the facets of a character people cannot feel represented UNLESS characters within every fictional race have the same colour skin as them, that\u2019s like me saying asian characters should be white otherwise I don\u2019t feel represented or I can\u2019t see myself in crouching tiger hidden dragon unless they recast the characters as white it\u2019s absolute nonsense and I\u2019d never wish that because it\u2019s a bastardisation of the character and lore.\n\nNo the point isn\u2019t that every single piece of media needs to represent every minority.

They certainly didn\u2019t *need* to do it with this show, but they decided to, and whether you accept it or not, it makes plenty of people extremely happy. Also nothing you described there is prejudice.

All this inclusivity does is make more people relate to Tolkien\u2019s works and as such make more people fall in love with them and appreciate them. The diversity, even if not lore-accurate, doesn\u2019t detract from Tolkien\u2019s legacy. It bolsters it immensely.

It may be that Galadriel chose it because she knew of the Dwarves of Khazadd\u00fbm (Moria). \\[...\\] She looked upon the Dwarves also with the eye of a commander, seeing in them the finest warriors to pit against the Orcs.  \n>  \n>\\[...\\]  \n>  \n>Galadriel, striving to counteract the machinations of Sauron, was successful in L\u00f3rinand\\[...\\]  \n>  \n>\\[...\\]  \n>  \n>He \\[Sauron\\] perceived at once that Galadriel would be his chief adversary and obstacle, and he endeavoured therefore to placate her, bearing her scorn with outward patience and courtesy.\n\nThe Nature of Middle Earth also states that Galadriel and Celeborn \"...take part in the settlement of Eregion, and **later of its defence against Sauron.**\"\n\nThese quotes partly contradict established lore (i.e. Celebrimbor founding Eregion) but what can be gleaned from them is that Tolkien imbued Galadriel with much more initiative in the Second Age than was present in her earlier characterisation, and set her up as Sauron's main rival in that time. Now she's still not exactly portrayed as a sword-swinging elf-maiden, but that portrayal is certainly better justified knowing how Tolkien came to see her role in the Second Age, and his own description of Galadriel as Amazonian (a word which he translated as meaning \"warrior-woman\"), capable of great athletic feats etc.\n\n>I'd honestly be fine with her fighting, but in the show she is being portrayed as this warrior captain who can't live without her sword and that is a complete 180 from what she is in the LOTR.\n\nTo be honest, we don't know the context of that \"without it, what am I?\" quote, but for now it's fair to assume that she's talking about the agency and initiative that the sword symbolises, rather than the sword and the notion of warfare itself.

I'll explain the gist of mine. (By the way, your English is great! It's a second language for me too, so I can appreciate the effort that goes into it)\n\nI've also been in IOTA since 2017. Practically everything about the project at the time was perfect for creating hype while based on nothing more than pipe dreams. What interested me was the fresh approach; the unique structure and the core tenet of feeless transactions of both data and value. As corny as it may sound, my mind started racing with the possibilities of a network like that \u2013 possibilities that BTC and ETH simply couldn't deliver. A couple things were weighing my mind though: the unorthodox design choices that seemed to serve no use in any foreseeable future (ternary logic and the hardware to go along with it), as well as the unprofessionalism of certain founders (who happened to be the ones pushing the less realistic concepts).\n\nWell, where do we find ourselves now? The unrealistic and frankly useless elements have been scrapped, along with the people perpetuating their necessity as well as damaging IOTA's reputation (although I still sincerely respect David). What does that leave us with? The core elements that got me excited in the first place, only now the IF is far more mature, and progress is visibly, transparently happening with the necessary breaking changes for true adoption just around the corner (well, relatively speaking).\n\nSo to address this:\n\n>please let me hear why you are so confident that the future development will be so much better\n\nFuture development aside, development *right now* is much better. It's actually, systematically happening, right now, with a clear strategy, based on thorough research.\n\nIn my eyes a feeless, decentralised protocol is a necessary and inevitable next step in the evolution of cryptos, and the chances of IOTA fulfilling that vision are better than ever. BTC and ETH have their place and they'll keep it. IOTA will hopefully claim its place relatively soon.\n\nEDIT: Just to add, I don't blame anyone for their pessimism regarding IOTA \u2013 the past has given a lot of reason for it.
