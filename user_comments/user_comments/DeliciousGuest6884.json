They discuss the issues you raise. About the Polish being bad. How much ethnic cleansing is okay in your view? What is the line, how many deaths are acceptable?\n\nIf an ethnic group within a country does not have any rights they will often rise up. There is multi generational trauma behind this, Ukrainians rose up and unleashed hell on innocent people, which is wrong. You have a similar situation with ethnic Russians and Russified Ukrainians in the Donbas. They  (some) don't consider themselves Ukrainians and want to embrace their culture. The difference being that they have a state (the biggest in the world) to move to, Ukrainians only had their own state from 1917-1920 and before that the Cossack states and before that Kyivan Rus. Combine this with the two leading ideologies in the interwar period being Communism and Fascism, these people are a product of their time and should be viewed as such.\n\nSo the question is, how do we preserve national identity, develop our language, while also preventing future issues with neighbors and ethnic minorities within our borders? Zelensky offered an idea to have a program with Poland, Belarus, Russia, Hungary, Romania, Moldova, Bulgaria and Slovakia in which their people in Ukraine as well as Ukrainians have opportunities to learn their languages and cultures as well as Ukrainians in their countries have the opportunity to do the same. You keep national/political identity by making this program a Sunday school type thing. Their primary identity should be Ukrainian, if they don't wish to participate in our society then they have the right to move to the country which they consider their homeland. I agree with this idea and I myself would love to learn all the languages of the countries that Ukraine borders. I support the idea of Ukrainian identity being more political than ethnic, but I think as a political nation Ukrainians should speak Ukrainian in addition to their ethnic language and perhaps English.\n\nSo being that the reason we study history is to draw conclusions from the past and to improve our future, I believe we can make the following conclusions;\n\nUkrainian/Polish/Jewish/Russian ethnic clashes are a result of these groups feeling enslaved within their own states and lashing out (with exception of the Jews, but nevertheless they did not have their own state). If you believe in the european project of ethnic states, then I think it is reasonable for these nations to have their own states. This is not the only factor but also the fact that the interwar area was full of radical ideology and this combination of radicalism and war and suppression allowed for the darkest time in European and world history, especially in Eastern Europe. If the Ukrainians are asked to take down their statues of questionable figures, the Poles and the Russians and the Hungarians should be asked to do the same thing with the same vitriol and hatred you seem to have for Ukrainians. But I suspect you view us as lesser. I am not against the removal of the statues (of which there are few, there are more statues of Russian figures in Ukraine), I think this is a reasonable request, so long as our neighbors will listen to our requests. But if you aren't Polish, Hungarian or Russian I don't know why you are even commenting on this issue. We don't need America's opinion on this, we will deal with this with our neighbors and find a fair compromise. I know it's hard for you guys not to insert yourself in every issue in the world.\n\nThe issue is, that we have been treated as an afterthought and a second class people for our entire history, and you demanding the removal of our statues but ignoring the same issue in Russia, Poland and Hungary and ignoring our concerns means that you do not truly view us as a sovereign state and people.

I would invite you to come to Ukraine and talk to people and see for yourself, you would get a warm welcome. I assume you don't mean to be provocative but your question in and of itself is very offensive and misinformed.\n\nThe USSR (Stalin era) and Nazi Germany are viewed pretty much in the same light. About 4 million Ukrainians were killed by Stalin and 1 million Ukrainians were killed by Hitler.\n\nIn the west of the country (eastern Poland at the time) people heard about the horrors of the famine and the repressions in the east. Read Anne Applebaum's book Red Famine to understand what was happening in the east and why they speak Russian there (most of the Ukrainians were starved to death and Russians were moved in). So in the beginning of the war people had a choice, go fight for the Germans or for the Russians. People didn't know just how evil Nazi Germany was at the time so in the first years of the war many from today's Western Ukraine were allied with the Nazis. No one is proud of this fact. Soon they realized that they were just as bad as the Russians and formed partisan groups that would fight against both the Nazis and the Russians. However, most Ukrainians' ancestors fought in the Red army. Some of them were Nazi collaborators, some of them fought in the forests. Some were victims of mass killings from both sides. This story is also true for the Baltic states, though I am not an expert on their history so I won't go into detail. We have a complicated history and it confuses me why you consider Ukrainians to be some super Nazis when the French had more collaborators than Ukraine did.\n\nI wrote another comment in this thread about why eastern Europeans are frustrated with the German people if you care to read it. There is no disdain or hatred, just disappointment and frustration.\n\n>Be happy that we help a country such as yours that is as hostile to us as you are. Also - get rid of all your problems before asking to join our union, nazi apologist.\n\nThese kind of comments are common from Germans. You view us as untermenschen who don't deserve life, and should be kissing your feet for any assistance. Germans stereotypically love being flattered and don't take criticism well (atleast on the political level), but of course these are just stereotypes. My point being is I'm not too surprised by this comment, which is why I said it made me laugh. You have never been here. You don't know our problems, you don't know what is happening here. You know nothing of my country yet you act as if you are the decider of what is correct and what is not. You think you can somehow govern my country better than I can. I don't want to put words in your mouth but this is the vibe I get from these type of comments. All the Poles and Lithuanians and Estonians and Latvians I know say the same thing. But that is anecdotal and I don't live there so I can't say for sure. If you don't understand why comments like these are offensive and dumb considering the history of your country and its foreign policy post WW2, then I don't really see a point in discussing this issue with you.\n\nEdit:\n\nBtw Glorification of Nazi Germany, using Nazi propaganda, display of Nazi symbols and antisemitism in Ukraine are all criminalized.", "created_utc": "1664098613.0", "edited": "1664099990.0", "id": "iptkqr5", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_xmtuk9", "parent_id": "t1_iptjib9", "score": "2", "subreddit": "europe", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh4j"}, {"author": "DeliciousGuest6884", "body": "What I am saying that Ukraine's Nazi problem deserves the same amount of attention as France's or Germany's.

I understand the context of this party, that is why I used the comparison. We don't have any public person or politician that would sympathize with Nazi Germany or the SS or anything like that. Our problem has always been with politicians whitewashing the crimes of the Soviet Union and the Russian Empire against the Ukrainian people. We have been fighting for our right to be Ukrainian within our own country for our entire existence. Ukrainians are tolerant, we are at war with Russia and no one cares that people still speak Russian throughout the country (50% of our population, almost 100% in my city), Russian liberals are invited to speak on our television channels, etc. So saying Ukraine has some sort of Nazi problem just shows a person is obviously not informed about the situation in the country and has never been here. And these comments are incredibly hurtful, not to mention dangerous.\n\nThere is no anti-German sentiment, there is frustration at your politicians' arrogance and looking at Eastern Europeans like lessers. I'll paint a picture so you can understand how all of your Eastern neighbors feel. Your country destroyed our countries almost completely, WW2 was mostly fought on our land. Our people were slaughtered. You get American money and the whole world forgives you right away and helps you rebuild (this isn't necessarily bad). We do not get this, instead we get occupied and face internal repressions until 91. We get independence then your government signs gas deal after gas deal with Russia, ignoring the security and economic concerns of your neighbors. Your government says it owes Russia because of WW2, again ignoring the fact that WW2 was mostly fought on our land. Ukraine gets invaded because you jeopardized all of Eastern European security. Then we hear from the descendants of Nazis that we are the actual Nazis and we need to get our act together. We react poorly to this and tell you you have no understanding of the history of our region and what is going on in our countries and what happened here. That is okay, we don't expect you to understand, but you act like you know better. You call us emotional and irrational and continue to westplain to us on just about every issue there is. You refuse to learn from your mistakes and listen to those who know what they are talking about. We speak Russian, we studied their literature in school, we know their history and culture and how their country and politics work. Yet you refuse to listen. Again and again. Merkel says she regrets nothing. And Germans get upset when the Ukrainian ambassador vocalizes this thought that is held in all countries east of you. All of this is happening while bombs are raining on my city every single day. And then you stop our other allies from giving us tanks and other weapons that save lives.\n\nWe appreciate the help you have given us, don't get me wrong. But sometimes you guys can be pretty naive.

We are at war with Russia and our top politicians speak Russian all the time, we have several government funded news channels in Russian. All of our online newspapers have Russian versions, people speak whatever language they want. Ukrainians are bilingual so the government and society could completely function in Russian if it had to, it could also completely function in Ukrainian. There are a lot of people who have switched or are switching to Ukrainian now just because they don't want to have anything in common with Russia and to protect our information space. It personally annoys me that people tolerate the Russian language so much and I don't consume Russian language content and will never speak this language with a person who understands Ukrainian, but that's just my view.\n\nBut really foreigners probably care about our language situation more than most people here do. Russians don't understand that a person can speak Russian and identify as a Ukrainian and support the development of the Ukrainian language.

Kyiv is probably the most completely bilingual city in the world so people switch based on the situation and if they are trying to make a certain point. It is completely normal to speak Ukrainian at work, Russian with friends, Ukrainian with mom and Russian with dad. The language situation has been changing very fast since 2004. People in Kyiv usually have beautiful Ukrainian but that isn't because of the language spoken there but more about the level of education and it is the most affluent city.\n\nThe official standard has been changing a bit since the fall of the Soviet Union because the Soviet government would change dictionaries and the spelling and grammar rules of Ukrainian to make it more similar to Russian. The idea was to draw the languages closer together so that people would just defer to Russian. Since independence and especially after 2014 there has been an effort to restore Ukrainian to its earlier form. The two most famous Ukrainian poets and the forefathers of the Ukrainian language Taras Shevchenko and Ivan Franko are from the very center and far west of the country respectively. There are also many significant Ukrainian writers from the east. They all wrote in their more western/central/eastern forms of Ukrainian so it is hard to say what the standard is. The Ukrainian language has been so oppressed and so many people have been killed, jailed and ridiculed for speaking and writing in Ukrainian over the past 200 years so the language has developed in a very odd way. But in general, people say Lviv is the cultural capital of Ukraine and it is the only big city that has retained its Ukrainianess throughout its entire recent history (last 100 years), so people consider the Ukrainian spoken by the intelligentsia there to be the standard.\n\nSorry for the long reply but I am very passionate about this topic haha", "created_utc": "1663919257.0", "edited": "1663919684.0", "id": "ipknewa", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_xlno52", "parent_id": "t1_ipkk89d", "score": "41", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "DeliciousGuest6884", "body": "Also, for masculine plural nouns we always have \u0438/\u0456 ending\n\n\u043f\u043e-\u0440\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u0434\u0432\u0430 \u043c\u0430\u043b\u044c\u0447\u0438\u043a\u0430, \u0430 \u0443\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0457\u043d\u0441\u044c\u043a\u043e\u044e \u0434\u0432\u0430 \u0445\u043b\u043e\u043f\u0446\u0456\n\n\u043f\u043e-\u0440\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u0434\u0432\u0430 \u043a\u043e\u043c\u043f\u044c\u044e\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0430, \u0430 \u0443\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0457\u043d\u0441\u044c\u043a\u043e\u044e \u0434\u0432\u0430 \u043a\u043e\u043c\u043f'\u044e\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0438\n\n\u0438 \u0442\u0430\u043a \u0434\u0430\u043b\u0435\u0435 \u0438 \u0442\u0430\u043a \u0434\u0430\u043b\u0435\u0435 \n\n\u041a\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0447\u0435, \u0435\u0441\u043b\u0438 \u0443 \u0432\u0430\u0441 \u0435\u0441\u0442\u044c \u0435\u0449\u0435 \u043a\u0430\u043a\u0438\u0435-\u0442\u043e \u0432\u043e\u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u044b \u043f\u043e \u043f\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0434\u0443 \u044f\u0437\u044b\u043a\u0430, \u0442\u043e \u043f\u0438\u0448\u0438\u0442\u0435, \u0431\u0443\u0434\u0443 \u0440\u0430\u0434 \u0432\u0430\u043c \u043f\u043e\u043c\u043e\u0447\u044c.", "created_utc": "1663912920.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ipkg3ik", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_xlno52", "parent_id": "t1_ipkemjw", "score": "33", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "DeliciousGuest6884", "body": "Ukrainian is 100% phonetic, tho there is some vowel reduction in western dialects that is completely different from the vowel reduction in Russian, but it isn't that widespread and is considered not correct.", "created_utc": "1663911922.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ipkeubx", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_xlno52", "parent_id": "t1_ipkea2q", "score": "22", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "DeliciousGuest6884", "body": "\u041d\u0435\u043c\u0430 \u0437\u0430 \u0449\u043e)", "created_utc": "1663911834.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ipkeq73", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_xlno52", "parent_id": "t1_ipkemjw", "score": "12", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "DeliciousGuest6884", "body": "Do what Ukrainians who don't speak Ukrainian well do.

As you get more comfortable with the language you can learn more literary Ukrainian that is farther away from Russian. While it is widespread to use a lot of Russian constructions and words, it is considered bad Ukrainian that mostly uneducated people speak (but no one really cares, Zelensky sucked at Ukrainian in 2019 and now he has perfect Ukrainian). There are a lot of people who speak such strong surzhyk that it is really hard to say if they are speaking Ukrainian or Russian. So basically don't worry. Also since we don't really have slang that is independent of Russian, we basically use surzhyk to imply irony and use Russian words as slang or when we are joking.\n\nBiggest mistakes Russian speakers make:\n\n\\- Russian \u0438 and Ukrainian \u0438 are different, Ukrainian is closer to Russian \u044b but not as deep in the throat.

They were the ones on the ground enforcing it and hiding data. I believe that every person is responsible to some degree for everything that happens in the world. The smaller the scale, the more responsibility. If bedroom is dirty that is my fault 100%, if my apartment is dirty I share that responsibility with my family, if my street is dirty I share that responsibility with the people on my street, this expands to my neighborhood, my city, my province, my country, my continent and my planet. But while I believe in strict accountability and talking responsibility, I can understand and accept counterarguments.\n\nIf my home, street and city are in order, that is thanks to my efforts or in spite of my lack of effort. This personally encourages me to not litter, donate blood, volunteer, vote in local and national elections, speak out, go to protests for things I believe in and generally be active in my community. I believe that people who do things like this hold less responsibility if things go to shit, but they still hold some. If my apartment building has trash at the entrance or is falling apart and I do nothing to organize with my neighbors to fix it and I don't clean up after myself, it is my fault to a large degree. So the bigger the scale and the smaller the problem, the less responsibility each person holds, also dependent on how active a person is in society. \n\nSo for a Russian person who has worked hard for years to spread democratic values and get rid of the toxicity in Russian society and has gone to protests for years holds less responsibility than those who did nothing or supported the war, yet still has some responsibility. Someone like Face the rapper I think has done the best he can using his platform and he admits it is not enough and he holds some responsibility. Will I cuss this person out or hate them?

If I think about my girlfriend being able to speak my language perfectly without an accent or little mistakes or her translating idioms word for word, I would actually be sad, like it is another person. We have shared so many laughs because of mistakes and jokes because of the fact we have different languages.\n\nWe normally speak our own native languages when we are tired or having an argument or serious conversation. This is what I would recommend to you to get more comfortable, ask your boyfriend to speak his native language with you and you just respond in English. You will feel like you are getting to really understand the real him while also being your real self. He will make different jokes, flirt differently with you and compliment you in a way that is more natural to him, no matter how good his english is.\n\nFunnily enough my girlfriend likes it more when I speak my native language and I like it more when she speaks hers. I used to think she would be happier and feel more of an emotional connection hearing me speak her language, but we find that we have a better connection when we are able to hear each other express ourselves naturally.

That being said they are human, they love their kids and their parents and want to be happy. \n\nTo answer your question, no. If a Russian soldier cries and helps some Ukrainian kid or whatever that does not redeem him. They have a lot of work to do. \n\nThere are Russians who fight for Ukraine right now, most (all) Ukrainians view them neutrally-positively. You could look there for inspiration. This is our defining moment as a nation, our culture and our people will never be the same. We don\u2019t want anything to do with them, no matter how many times they say sorry.

If it\u2019s just some words every once and awhile that everyone uses I probably wouldn\u2019t even notice. If it\u2019s pretty bad I would think that it\u2019s funny and endearing.

Maybe someone will tell you how to say it in Ukrainian depending on your level. If you speak pretty \u201cclean\u201d Ukrainian you will actually get a lot of compliments, especially from Russian speakers and people who use surzhyk in their everyday life. The thing is that a lot of Ukrainian slang is just Russian words, people often use them on purpose when trying to imply irony or the stupidity of a situation or just joking around. \n\nYou may hear something like \u00ab\u0432\u0456\u043d \u0442\u0430\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0442\u0443\u043f\u043e\u0439\u00bb (\u0442\u0443\u043f\u0438\u0439/\u0434\u0440\u0443\u043d\u0438\u0439 in Ukrainian) or \u00ab\u0442\u0443\u0442 \u0442\u0430\u043a \u043a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u0456\u0432\u0430\u00bb (\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u0438\u0432\u043e, \u0433\u0430\u0440\u043d\u043e)\n\nIf you immerse yourself in Ukrainian content you will inevitably pick up some Russian because people don\u2019t usually switch the language they\u2019re speaking and it\u2019s extremely saturated in our media environment. I\u2019d say Ukraine is probably the most truly bilingual country on earth. The whole language situation is changing rapidly so it\u2019s difficult to say what it will be like in a decade or two. \n\nDespite what you may think and what you may have heard from Russian propaganda no one really makes a big deal out of language, only if it\u2019s a public figure or politican. So theoretically, you could speak Russian and no one would say much, some may just respond to you in Ukrainian. That being said, it makes me very happy and the majority of Ukrainians happy when a foreigner wants to speak our language. So keep going. But as a foreigner in general you can do what you want with respect to language.\n\nEdit: You made my day by saying Russian looks like funny Ukrainian to you. You don\u2019t know how many times I\u2019ve heard Russians say the opposite about our language.)", "created_utc": "1659549150.0", "edited": "1659552388.0", "id": "iit6lue", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_wfbn82", "parent_id": "t3_wfbn82", "score": "21", "subreddit": "Ukrainian", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qum6"}, {"author": "DeliciousGuest6884", "body": "\u0412\u0430\u0443 \u0442\u0430\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u043c\u0443\u0434\u0440\u044b\u0435 \u0441\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0430. \u0421\u043f\u0430\u0441\u0438\u0431\u043e \u0442\u0435\u0431\u0435, \u0440\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0438\u043d\u0442\u0435\u043b\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0442\u0443\u0430\u043b! \u0422\u044b \u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432, \u0441 \u0441\u0435\u0433\u043e\u0434\u043d\u044f\u0448\u043d\u0435\u0433\u043e \u0434\u043d\u044f \u044f \u0431\u0443\u0434\u0443 \u0441\u043e\u0441\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0440\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0447\u043b\u0435\u043d \u043a\u0430\u0436\u0434\u044b\u0439 \u0434\u0435\u043d\u044c, \u0447\u0442\u043e\u0431\u044b \u0431\u044b\u0442\u044c \u043b\u0438\u0447\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c\u044e, \u0438 \u0434\u043e\u043a\u0430\u0437\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0432\u0430\u043c \u0441\u0432\u043e\u044e \u043b\u043e\u044f\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c, \u043a\u0430\u043a \u0433\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0448\u044c! \u0421\u043f\u0430\u0441\u0438\u0431\u043e \u0435\u0449\u0451 \u0440\u0430\u0437, \u0440\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0445\u043e\u0437\u044f\u0438\u043d. \n\n\u0423 \u043c\u0435\u043d\u044f \u0440\u043e\u0434\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0438 \u043f\u043e\u0433\u0438\u0431\u043b\u0438 \u043e\u0442 \u043e\u0431\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0435\u043b\u043e\u0432 \u043c\u043e\u0435\u0433\u043e \u0425\u0430\u0440\u044c\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0430 \u0438 \u0432\u0430\u0448\u0430 \u0441\u0442\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0430 \u0440\u0430\u0437\u0440\u0443\u0448\u0438\u043b\u0430 \u043c\u043e\u044e \u0436\u0438\u0437\u043d\u044c, \u043d\u0430\u0434\u043e \u0431\u044b\u043b\u043e \u0440\u0430\u043d\u044c\u0448\u0435 \u0441\u043a\u0430\u0437\u0430\u0442\u044c, \u0447\u0442\u043e \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e \u043d\u0430\u0434\u043e \u043e\u0442\u043e\u0439\u0442\u0438 \u043e\u0442 \u043e\u0431\u0449\u0435\u0433\u043e \u0440\u0430\u0437\u0443\u043c\u0430! \u0421\u0442\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043a\u043e \u043b\u044e\u0431\u043e\u0432\u0438! \u042f \u0443\u0436\u0435 \u0435\u0435 \u0447\u0443\u0432\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0443\u044e!\n\n\u042f \u043d\u0435 \u0437\u043d\u0430\u044e \u043f\u043e\u0447\u0435\u043c\u0443 \u044f \u0434\u043e \u0441\u0438\u0445 \u043f\u043e\u0440 \u043e\u0445\u0443\u0435\u0432\u0430\u044e, \u043a\u043e\u0433\u0434\u0430 \u0441\u043b\u044b\u0448\u0443 \u0442\u0430\u043a\u0443\u044e \u0445\u0443\u0439\u043d\u044e \u043e\u0442 \u0440\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u044f\u043d, \u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0440\u044b\u0435 \u0445\u043e\u0442\u044f\u0442 \u043a\u0430\u0437\u0430\u0442\u044c\u0441\u044f \u0442\u0430\u043a\u0438\u043c\u0438 \u0434\u043e\u0445\u0443\u044f \u0443\u043c\u043d\u044b\u043c\u0438. \u0415\u0441\u043b\u0438 \u0431\u044b \u0441\u0438\u0442\u0443\u0430\u0446\u0438\u044f \u043d\u0435 \u0431\u044b\u043b\u0430 \u0442\u0430\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u0441\u0435\u0440\u044c\u0451\u0437\u043d\u043e\u0439, \u0442\u043e \u0431\u044b\u043b\u043e \u0431\u044b \u0440\u0435\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e \u043e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u044c \u0441\u043c\u0435\u0448\u043d\u043e. \n\n\u041f\u0440\u0438\u0447\u0451\u043c \u0437\u0434\u0435\u0441\u044c \u0443\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u044f\u0437\u044b\u043a? \u0420\u0435\u0447\u044c \u0432\u043e\u043e\u0431\u0449\u0435 \u043e\u0431 \u044d\u0442\u043e\u043c \u043d\u0435 \u0448\u043b\u0430. \u041c\u0435\u043d\u044f \u044d\u0442\u043e \u043d\u0435 \u0435\u0431\u0435\u0442.
