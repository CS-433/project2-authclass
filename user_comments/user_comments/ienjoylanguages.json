Statements such as \"\u0432 \u0431\u0438\u0431\u043b\u0438\u043e\u0442\u0435\u043a\u0435\" v biblioteke (\"in the library\") or \"\u043d\u0430 \u0410\u043b\u044f\u0441\u043a\u0435\", na Aljaske (\"in Alaska\"), demonstrate the use of the prepositional case to indicate location. However, this case is also used after the preposition \"\u043e\" (\"about\") as in \"\u043e \u0441\u0442\u0443\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0435\", o studente (\"about the student\").**Nevertheless, approximately 150 masculine nouns retain a distinct form for the locative case, used only after \"\u0432\" and \"\u043d\u0430\".** These forms end in \"-\u0443\u0301\" or \"-\u044e\u0301\": \"\u043b\u0435\u0436\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0432 \u0441\u043d\u0435\u0433\u0443\u0301\", le\u017ea\u0165 v sneg\u00fa (to lie in the snow), but \"\u0434\u0443\u043c\u0430\u0442\u044c \u043e \u0441\u043d\u0435\u0301\u0433\u0435\", duma\u0165 o sn\u00e9ge (to think about snow).

As indicated by the accent marks, the stress is always on the last syllable, which is unlike the dative-case forms with the same spelling. A few feminine nouns that end with the soft sign, such as \u0434\u0432\u0435\u0440\u044c and \u043f\u044b\u043b\u044c, also have a locative form that differs from the prepositional in that the stress shifts to the final syllable: \"\u043d\u0430 \u0434\u0432\u0435\u0440\u0438\u0301\", na dver\u00ed (\"on the door\"), but \"\u043f\u0440\u0438 \u0434\u0432\u0435\u0301\u0440\u0438\", pri dv\u00e9ri (\"by the door\"). These distinct feminine forms are sometimes referenced as \"second locative\" or \"new locative\", because they developed independently from the true locative case, which existed in the Old Russian.\\[1\\]\\[2\\]\\[3\\]With some words, such as \u0434\u043e\u043c, dom (house), the second locative form is used only in certain idiomatic expressions, while the prepositional is used elsewhere. For example, \"\u043d\u0430 \u0434\u043e\u043c\u0443\u0301\", na domu (\"at the house\" or \"at home\") would be used to describe activity that is performed at home, while \"\u043d\u0430 \u0434\u043e\u0301\u043c\u0435\" (\"on the house\") would be used to specify the location of the roof.\n\nSeriously feel like I'm about to give up.", "created_utc": "1623288538.0", "edited": "1623288935.0", "id": "h1882p2", "is_submitter": "True", "link_id": "t3_nw7quo", "parent_id": "t1_h180kwx", "score": "1", "subreddit": "russian", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qlc6"}, {"author": "ienjoylanguages", "body": "I didn't realize it but I bought this a long time ago on my Kindle and when I opened it just now after years it was opened to the exact page discussing the exceptions.

There is an exception: it is \u043b\u0435\u0441\u0443 whenever \u0432 or \u043d\u0430 are written in front of it it. That is to say, its *prepositional* declension looks like what should be its *dative* declension. There are a lot of exceptions like this in Russian. Would like to know if there was a resource that had compiled all these declension quirks in one place.\n\nAnd I am referring to finding a list of feminine irregulars change their stems like \u0434\u043e\u0447\u044c not changing to \u0434\u043e\u0447\u0438 but \u0434\u043e\u0447\u0435\u0440\u0438.\n\nAnd masculine genitive referring to instances where words like \u0431\u0440\u0430\u0442\u044c going to \u0431\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0435\u0432 instead of \u0431\u0440\u0430\u0442\u043e\u0432\u044c (similar to other words that end in a consonant like \u043c\u043e\u0441\u0442 to \u043c\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0432, etc.).

Even the \u201c3 \u043f\u043e'\u0441\u201d are actually \u043f\u043e \u043f\u043e \u043f\u0440\u043e.

Genitive in particular seems to be a wastebasket declension that they keep shoving new prepositions into, at least a couple dozen at this point. Again, these are just sign posts for underlying concepts.\n\nThis last point is crucial: sloppy mnemonics can be very powerful but also have the potential for creating bad habits if not done carefully. If new to them as a memory device I would leave the more complicated stuff for when there's more experience with memorization techniques or find a cleaner approach that works for you.
