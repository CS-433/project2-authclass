I stay away from it - but that's not a moralistic judgment in any fashion it's just I don't like working with what I find to be very unpredictable stuff. Magick, in my experience, also tends to teach us a lesson through its mainifestations. Maybe there is some good in there - it was a ritual that you performed so you ought to be able to find some benefit as long as there were no serious errors etc - to meditiate on and think about. See if you can draw out a lesson from this somewhere and try to garner some positive outcome for yourself with this.   \n\n\nThat's extremely difficult to do given the current circumstances - I entirely understand, but magicians have to be ready for this stuff when it comes especially after a working. I'm sorry to hear that he cheated on you. No matter if you knew he was like that or not - that sucks hard. However, I still think you can find some good in this ritual outcome if you reflect on it and find something in there that can be a lesson about yourself, your relationships, interactions with folks, theirs with you and your reactions, etc. \n\nI find that magick gives us the results need, not always the results we want. Especially magick that doesn't enter into some sort of agreement with a particular entity to bring about a particular requested result (that has far more predictable outcomes...usually lol). I've found that magick that is just general has beneficial outcomes, but they will be beneficial in ways that may be beyond what we would have thought for ourselves as beneficial. It's up to us to discover how it's beneficial for us and to make use of what we get back from our magick. This is entirely only my opinion though and based only one anecdotal stuff from my own practice so take it our leave it 100%. \n\nBut, at the end of the day; it sucks he cheated on you.

It\u2019s also a harsh distinction between city or village. In some cities it\u2019s really not too big of a deal if you can blend in. Greece has some serious machismo issues and religion is a super infused part of the culture so if someone is unable to pass it can be difficult, but we have pretty good laws against any discrimination so access to services etc is very good. Some doctors can be assholes but they can not refuse service etc. it\u2019s a weird experience.

That\u2019s especially hard to feel when living in an environment that tells you the exact opposite all the time 24/7. But that\u2019s what we\u2019re all here for and other resources too. I\u2019ll see if I can find you some online even resources in your country if you would like? Maybe they can point you in the direction of some more local resources? I can\u2019t promise anything but I\u2019ll look :) \n\nRegarding DIY: I\u2019m not sure how that works, and for sure never do anything you\u2019re not comfortable with at all. I\u2019ve seen resources for people to order them under a doctor or something, but I\u2019ve never experienced them. They seem to be a purely European and American thing and didn\u2019t exist for me at the time. That\u2019s why I was asking your general area. I\u2019m sorry these resources are not available to you right now. \n\nHaha. Yes, I am probably old enough to be your mom. So at least keep reaching out and talking to folks. Stay connected. Anything you have to do to get through this rough time and come out the other side <3 we want you here, and the world is better with you in it. Please do seek help for your depression - there are a lot of online resources so I\u2019ll try to find some for you :) \n\nIf you ever need to talk you can always reply here or message :)", "created_utc": "1648994339.0", "edited": "False", "id": "i382ai3", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_tv6u5g", "parent_id": "t1_i37wzke", "score": "1", "subreddit": "MtF", "subreddit_id": "t5_2ub9j"}, {"author": "mellowtala", "body": "Are you seeing the therapist for gender issues?

Stable I always recommend Debian..but that's also like server-level stable. My advice to anyone looking to switch from Windows to Linux is to not do it all at once. It can be a bit much and too hard of an adjustment; also, while you learn you still need to get things done for work etc and feeling unable to do that will inevitably cause you to give up and switch back to windows. So, I recommend - if you can - installing Linux on a separate machine (not just dual boot). Follow a video tutorial if you can - and just get a general feel for the process, how things connect, etc. Don't worry too much about the details the first time (or few even if you're trying multiple distros). This way, you mentally treat the machine as separate from your day to day tasks and you can feel more freedom to experiment with it, try new tasks, etc (this doesn't need to be anything special just something you can play around with). Once you feel comfortable with Linux in general start trying to do some of your daily tasks on the Linux machine. This gives you time to work out quirks with programs etc as they may work a bit different than your normal windows programs.   \n\n\nOnce you feel like you can comfortably perform most of your tasks on your separate computer that is the time to start researching your main machine. Look up the motherboard, CPU, GPU, etc. and start checking which drivers etc you'll need to install for your machine. Plan your install (as opposed to following a tutorial for the separate machine). Make sure your distro plays nice with your hardware etc. This is where you can learn a lot more about how all the software pieces you learned about earlier fit together with the hardware directly.   \n\n\nFinally, install it onto your new machine and enjoy.

So, individuals will each come to this realisation in unique ways. Some come to it from tragedy, some from not tragedy.

Is it okay if I give two cents on this? Perhaps it can help :) I mention that I came out to my parents at 6 (even in the 90s LOL), was socialized as a girl growing up, and well...now obviously live as myself :) So my experience of transition is a LOT different than those folks who transition at a later age, but I think perhaps it can still offer some helpful insight maybe :)   \n\n\nOne of the most important things for me in my transition was to stop associating things with 'this gender' or 'that gender'. It's thinking that all of us are conditioned to believe - especially women (don't do this it's not feminine etc). However, growing up trans my parents were more about policing this because if I did things that were stereotypically 'boyish' they would start questioning me (they were super duper supportive, but they are parents and they worried I was making the right decision at the time). I learned very early what was considered \"girly\" and what was \"boyish\"; and this did more harm than good. I missed out on activities that I would have loved to do with my friends back then (like rock climbing, tae kwon do, etc) even though the other girls were doing it because I had to 'prove myself to my parents. This caused a HUGE hangup into my teens and early 20s where I would hyper police my behaviour to make sure I fit in with the other girls. I actually started to stifle more of myself than I would have maybe if I transitioned later in life because I had all these unnecessary gender hangups.   \n\n\nI guess what I mean is - maybe help your partner realize that she can be her and she doesn't have to change her hobbies, interests, or even try to develop new ones. She's a woman, and so anything she does is a 'girly' thing. That's the most healthy aspect I think even young cis women ought to grow up hearing, and if I ever adopt a daughter that's for sure what I'm going to try and show her <3   \n\n\nHowever, your partner also wants to experience her own femininity because it's new for her - and it's such a good sign that she came to you to ask because it shows she super trusts you and looks up to you. It's really cute actually <3 You're doing great things with the makeup, etc. My advice would be to think back to the special memories you and your mother have. Like, I can remember going shopping for a bra the first time and learning about sizing, how to make it comfortable (and also the secret stash for cash) all from my mother - think about stuff most folks don't even think about having learned because it was just part of growing up, and perhaps share some of those memories with your partner. One thing my mother and I would always do was go to the mall, get huge pretzels and lemonade, and just talk about the guys walking around (I learned my mother and I have a similar type when it comes to men..LOL old Greek guys hahaha). It's memories like that which I cherish most and when I remember feeling the most 'girly' I guess. (obviously, there are many more but I don't want to type too much this is already insanely long).   \n\n\nI hope this makes some sense? I'm on a mobile so I can't really see all that is written.   \n\n\nI hope this makes some sense? I'm on mobile so I can't really see all that is written.   \n about it.

If that is something that would trigger you I wanted to mention it here because that's not my intention at all. I'm just sharing my experience with the US legal system and my transition - and I'm pretty sure as far as I know these legal protections don't have anything to do with that thankfully (now how well the general public behaves regardless of laws...we are all well aware that this doesn't always add up and that sucks. Anyway, sorry..I just don't want to hurt anyone (and I remember when I was transitioning I would sometimes get mad dysphoria when I read stuff like this) so I'm just trying to be upfront <3 I hope that makes sense? I really am new to being open again and I don't want to hurt anyone. The culture is so much better now, and I want to be a part of that..not the old toxic one I transitioned in..and old me is trying to adapt and learn the new ways from all you wonderful ladies <3 )  \n\n\nI can offer my experience living in the USA. How much does this apply to Canada? I'm sorry but I can not say. However, I hope seeing some other experiences maybe help give you some  hope <3. I've lived 15 years without having to tell anyone but my doctor about my transition - including government officials, visas, immigration, etc.   \n\n\n1. Name change: super easy. I didn't really even need to give a reason. I put religious conversion to be snarky, and the judge didn't even mention it. \n2. Documents (passport, birth certificate, ID, social security, etc): all very simple with the caveat of having to have undergone SRS/GCS. Prior to that all I could do was change my name. However, after SRS everything was changed and unless I tell somebody I'm trans there is no way for them to really know barring looking up - at this point - very old court records. I have a generic name...so that's not really a concern for me. I've lived 15 years in stealth (because of my area) and haven't had any issues legally anywhere.\n3. Jail: If you've changed your gender and undergone surgery in the States you will go to a female prison. I don't know what the case is if you are pre-surgury. Just, you know...either way...try not to really need this knowledge LOL\n4. I've been in extended stays in the hospital because of my asthma etc. Always with other women or a single room (if I get lucky because who doesn't want a private room). But it's never been because I'm trans just because I asked for one if it was possible because of my social anxiety. The doctors know at the hospital I go to - my status is on my records - and nobody has ever given me a problem. You should be fine (again at least in the states). \n5. As for travel, if you've changed your documents federally (I'm ignorant to Canadian systems) you should have no issues with internal nor external travel. It's all about what's on that passport (or similar federal ID). \n6. You can use women's restrooms once you have legally transitioned for sure. Prior to it, I think it's on a state by state basis. How would they know? Even if someone was a mean individual and tried to report you if you're documents line up no police officer is going to dig any deeper than that into the issue as long as you stay reasonable and collected. They won't ask you for a birth certificate or anything, just your ID I assume (I've never had this happen though so maybe others know more and can fill you in <3). \n7. Gendered sports: This is a tricky situation. I compete in triathlon in the women's division..but I'm just a regular age grouper who has no hope of ending up on a podium. I just compete for my own times. I don't tell anyone, and again any documents I give them have female on them. I also compete in Tae Kwon Do and get my ass kicked constantly by the other women..haven't told a soul at my dojo..haven't had any issues if I win a match either. I spar in HEMA (longsword) in the female division. I win sometimes, I lose other times. No issues, nobody knows. Nobody has asked. \n8. The Draft: I haven't registered for the selective service since I changed my gender with the social security administration after my SRS. The lady told me that I didn't need to register anymore, and was very kind about taking my card and disposing of it for me in the shredder where I could see it.
