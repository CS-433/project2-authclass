Chinese media openly discusses and shows footage of this because the idea of bringing \"dirt poor rural residents\" of Xinjiang into more urban settings where they can earn a living is seen as a good thing.\r  \n\r  \nThis is part of China's massive poverty alleviation plan, but there also isn't much of a say in if you want to be relocated if you're part of the rural community especially. \n\nAnd then of course there's always the classic \"war on terorrism\" retro-justification. \n\nWhat that results in is, mostly due to the fact that it is a right-wing State, mass incarceration and police discrimination based on ethnic/religious background, cultural erasure and general systematic discrimination. I would say the best comparison of the results is the concentration camps on the southern border of the US, or maybe their prison system in general, especially in regards to African Americans and Latinos.", "created_utc": "1652818223.0", "edited": "False", "id": "i8zle2b", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_urk346", "parent_id": "t1_i8zgzbx", "score": "-1", "subreddit": "RedsKilledTrillions", "subreddit_id": "t5_mr96n"}, {"author": "MagicianWoland", "body": "You know genocides don\u2019t have to have death camps right?
