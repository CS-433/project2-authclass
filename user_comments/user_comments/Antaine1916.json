They settled on the standard of \"A book had to have been written in Hebrew first in order to be inspired.\" That eliminated all the New Testament (which had been written originally in Greek and Aramaic -- Hebrew had long before died out as a community language). It also meant eliminating seven books of the Old Testament (and portions of others). In Jesus's time, the Septuagint was the most popular and accepted version/canon of the Jewish scriptures, and this new standard altered that (giving us what is today called the Masoretic text). How do we know they had another standard? Apart from Jesus either directly quoting or making obvious references from the whole of the Septuagint canon, it is in one of the eliminated books that the entire basis of Hanukkah is found and in one of the other eliminated portions that the entire basis of the festival of Purim is found.   All of the best and most complete manuscripts (necessary for bible translations) were in the possession of the Church, so if they new protestants hoped to have any authority at all for their new, vernacular translations, they either needed access to the manuscripts (which they weren't going to get) or they needed to adopt a new standard that said such access wasn't necessary.

I find it sometimes resonates with protestants.\n\nHowever, he seems to have deeply bought into anti-Catholic propaganda, and the best answer (if he persists) is that you'll need to drop the relationship.\n\n## --------------------------\u200b\n\n\u200b Several things will be relevant here, and I'll only be able to scratch the surface in this format. \n\nFor starters, there's the difference between Latria (adoration/true worship) and Dulia (honor/veneration). That Protestants think the hyper-dulia we give to Mary is somehow a form of latria (or that dulia can become latria if you just have a ton of it) speaks more to the very watered-down concept of \"worship\" endemic to Protestantism.\n\nBecause Protestants have eschewed true worship (e.g. the Eucharist, the sacrifice of the altar, etc), what they think amounts to \"worship\" (i.e. latria) is really just dulia. They see similarities to their dulia in what the Catholics do with Mary and the saints, and so they accuse us of misplaced adoration, when really it's just that they have an impoverished sense of what true worship is. Latria and dulia are different in kind, and are not merely different degrees of the same thing, so no amount of dulia can ever add up to latria (just as God is different in kind from all created things; he's not just the biggest, most powerful thing in the universe). So what we give to Mary is dulia, never latria, as latria is given only to God. That situation is entirely right and proper.\n\nNow, the question is, why is Mary deserving of the dulia we give her. For starters, she is the new ark of the new covenant. Not only is she a role model for us all (\"behold, I am the handmaid of the Lord\"), but she carried the Living Word within her just as the ark carried the Word written on stone (and that was also given dulia -- the new covenant is not lesser than the old, so the new ark should be given as much and more). Part of Jesus's human nature was gotten from her, and all was permitted to proceed after her \"fiat\" opened the gate.\n\nYes, she deserves it.\n\nWhat about her intercessory role? Well, it's biblical.\n\nIn the ancient Jewish Davidic monarchy, the queen mother (with the title \"Gebira\") had a special place in the court. It was not the wife of the king who was special, but his mother. The queen mother sat at the right hand of the king, and she was an avenue for the commoners to petition the king through her intercession. The queen mother is mentioned in the Old Testament books of Kings when new kings' reigns are introduced. You can see one example of the scriptural basis for people using the queen mother's intercession to petition the king in 1 Kings 2:16-20:\n\n\"Now therefore I ask one petition of thee: turn not away my face. And she said to him: Say on. And he said: I pray thee speak to king Solomon (for he cannot deny thee any thing) to give me Abisag the Sunamitess to wife. And Bethsabee said: Well, I will speak for thee to the king. Then Bethsabee came to king Solomon, to speak to him for Adonias: and the king arose to meet her, and bowed to her, and sat down upon his throne: and a throne was set for the king's mother, and she sat on his right hand. And she said to him: I desire one small petition of thee, do not put me to confusion. And the king said to her: My mother, ask: for I must not turn away thy face.\"\n\nWe see Mary play precisely this kind of role in the wedding feast at Cana, where people have a problem and they go to Mary, who requests that Jesus do something about it. He fulfills her request (and at time when it seems he would not have done so had she, personally, not asked -- \"My hour is not yet come\").\n\nAs Jesus takes over the Davidic kingship, he takes over his court, and that earthly type (the court) has its counterpart in heaven (not that heaven is copying earth, but the earthly court and kingship of David was designed to be a reflection of the divine intention for the court of heaven, Gebira and all, for the old court and Gebira are not greater than the new).", "created_utc": "1666647644.0", "edited": "False", "id": "itn6iff", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_ycennr", "parent_id": "t3_ycennr", "score": "1", "subreddit": "Catholicism", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qi4f"}, {"author": "Antaine1916", "body": "Not much.
