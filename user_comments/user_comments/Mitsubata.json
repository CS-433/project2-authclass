The most ideal case would be to do this in a computer lab where every student has the same deck and settings. They can go through their cards as they please and review that way. There are a few issues with this: \u2460 Not every school has a computer lab or resources to do such a thing. \u2461 Setup and maintenance is a chore, but convincing the higher-ups will be even more bothersome. \u2462 Having to teach afterwards in a computer lab may not be ideal. \n\nAnd then I thought, \u201cWell, maybe I could get them to do Anki reps at home with a deck I will send them and custom settings I provide them.\u201d This way, you could have each student print out their data sheet and assign them grades that way. This is better in my opinion, but there are still some noticeable problems: \u2460 Students may not quite understand the system or may not get used to it, resulting in a lack of usage and, as a result, a lack of learning. \u2461 Students risk using it falsely or inappropriately; they cannot be monitored in the classroom. \n\nThere are pros and cons to each method.

In other words, can other speakers understand each other when speaking to one another? In the vast majority of cases considering all languages of the world, this determining factor works well. Of course, English speakers are unable to understand Korean speakers and vice versa. Therefore, by this definition, we can rule them as separate languages. \n\nBut what about languages that have relatively the same grammar but different lexicon (vocabulary)? If speakers of each language cannot understand the other, then we can safely rule them as separate languages by this definition. Japanese and Korean speakers have roughly the same grammar but cannot understand one another because their vocabulary and sound system are overall quite different. \n\nThere are, of course, special circumstances that complicate things for this rule. For example, one-sided intelligibility. This is seen in South American Spanish and Brazilian Portuguese. Speakers of Portuguese can understand Spanish overall, but not the other way around. So are they technically separate languages? The same situation with Mandarin and surrounding dialects of Chinese. They all can read the same writing system and use tones in their pronunciations, they have pretty much the same grammar, but they are considered separate languages by the people there. This is mainly due to a cultural difference amongst the local peoples. \n\nSo, in short, the answer is complicated and there is likely no one, single answer.

There are apparently many prestigious schools in Tokyo, but I imagine they are hard to get into (both as a student and as a teacher). You are more likely to get hired at a smaller, lesser-known school whose primarily objective is to stay afloat in this stagnant economy. That means that you will likely be working at a place that is catering to students and parents for their money. This can be a very toxic environment and many smaller schools are not equipped (or even accredited) to actually be places of proper learning. The majority of private schools in Japan are like this, unfortunately. \n\nWith the economy, general lack of discipline by the kids, and the state of most small private schools today, it is generally my advice to **not** teach at a private school in Japan. \n\nBut if you\u2019re absolutely convinced that it\u2019s the path for you (which may change after a year or two of teaching here), then allow me to provide some advice when looking for a school to teach in.\n\n- Ask about the discipline policy. Many schools do not have one (or, don\u2019t have a good one) and, as a result, kids tend to run rampant. If they BS something or have a weak policy, red flag. If they say something like, \u201cthe students here are generally well-behaved,\u201d red flag.\n- Watch classes through the cameras if your school has them. See how certain teachers teach and especially look at how kids act. If they refuse to let you observe a class via cameras, red flag. You don\u2019t want to observe classes in person as teachers and students will always change their behavior and you won\u2019t get a true picture.\n- Ask about non-contractual/extra work that may not have been posted in the job listing. This happened to me before; I thought I was just teaching regular classes but they also wanted me to teach cram-school-style classes during after-school. It was never actually written in my contract or on the job listing.\n- Look at the bathrooms. Some smaller, often older schools will have open, anyone-can-use style bathrooms without any segregation whatsoever. In schools I taught at in America, this would never happen as it\u2019s a potential lawsuit. One false claim can cost you your job, reputation, and could land you some jail time or even deportation. Schools with this type of bathroom setup are a red flag.\n- Ask about accreditation. If they give you some BS or state that they don\u2019t have any (or that they don\u2019t actually need accreditation), red flag.\n- Ask whether other teachers are licensed. If there are any faculty that are not, red flag.\n\nBasically, if it\u2019s not a big-name, fancy-smancy private school in the heart of Tokyo, it\u2019s likely not what you\u2019re looking for/thinking of. These schools will **drain** you (physically, mentally, emotionally).

Together, these act as the subject. FAVORITE is the adjective here and, as I stated in a previous comment, it is fine being after the noun it modifies.

Not sure where you\u2019re getting that they normally come before. This is due to the tendency for signers to use the topic-comment structure. \n\nIt is normal (preferred even) to sign the following:\nHOUSE BLUE (a blue house)\nSHIRT GREEN (a green shirt)\nMAN WHITE (a white man)\n\nOf course, ASL is extremely flexible and you will often see the adjective come before the noun it modifies too. This is totally okay. But I would say that the adjective coming after the noun it modifies is the most prevalent structure.\n\nThat being said, the sentence, YOUR SHOES FAVORITE WHAT, is totally natural. It should be translated as, \u201cWhat are your favorite shoes?\u201d The instructor is not in error here.\n\nKeep in mind that ASL is not simply English but with signs. It is its own language with its own grammar and syntax. Of course ASL is super flexible with word ordering, but there are general patterns that are more common than others. The noun-adjective structure is more commonly used among Deaf and HoH than the adjective-noun structure.\n\nWhen it comes to FAVORITE, you may commonly see it come before a noun, but really any ordering is fine.

He\u2019s in his own world and it\u2019s comfortable there. I get that.

My point is: don\u2019t force your son to do anything he\u2019s not ready to do, but maybe just communicate to him that you\u2019re supportive and appreciative of him. One day, he may decide to even seek therapy or counseling on his own.

What actually defines a school as \"international\" differs from school to school. For instance, in my school, there are only a handful of classes that are conducted in English: spelling, language (English), and American history. The remaining classes (Japanese, math, science, social studies) are all carried out in Japanese by Japanese native teachers. Just with those handful of classes conducted in English, they are allowed to call themselves an \"international\" school.\n\nIt is also worth mentioning that some international schools may employ workers from countries like Africa or the Philippines (which is the case at my school; I am the only American). As a result, children may learn English with a Philippine or African accent. They may also begin using words that are not common in countries like America and Great Britain. If you don't mind that, then my school would be great for you!\n\nPersonally, I would never send my child to my own international school \u2013\u2013 the above points being the primary reasons. Additionally, the teachers here are mean and students get almost no play time/relaxation time. The school director actually told me that this school should be run more like a \u587e (cram school) than a regular school. Additionally, it is so important to actually speak to the teachers beforehand and to actually see how classes are conducted. And to do this, it is important that you view live classes from a camera and NOT in person. The reason being that teachers drastically change when parents or hopeful customers (yes, that's what students and their families are referred to as) walk by.\n\nAnd if you think your child will learn Japanese at an international school in Japan, think again. The 100% American kids take lower level Japanese classes so they are not overwhelmed and can barely even utter a simple sentence. Their ability to read the writing system is also nonexistent. \n\nTL;DR\n\nNot all international schools are the same.
