There is also a function underneath this code the animates the image but that doesn't seem to have an issue. The image is a sprite animation sheet and this code is supposed to allow me to move through the sheet vertically (to different animations like \"run\" and \"jump\") and the animation function (which I excluded) cycles horizontally through which ever animation row it is on. \n\nAfter the animtionStates.forEach function, I am supposed to be able to console.log(spriteAnimations) and see an array with the animationStates, each of which should have an array of the frames for each animation (not the number of frames as listed in the animationStates array but the actual location of them in xy coordinates across the animation sheet). Instead I get an empty array with no frame locations. \n\nI think you're very right about this not being a strict mode issue, but it was the only error I could see. However, I only see it when console.log(animationStates), and when I try to inspect the forEach function in the array I get from there, I get the strict mode error when I try to inspect the arguments. \n\nSorry for this being massively long. \n\nThis is the function that I have afterwards just in case:\n\n  \nfunction animate() {  \nctx.clearRect(0, 0, CANVAS\\_WIDTH, CANVAS\\_HEIGHT);  \nlet position = Math.floor(gameFrame/staggerFrames) % 6;   \nframex = spriteWidth \\* position;  \nctx.drawImage(playerImage, framex, framey, spriteWidth, spriteHeight, 0, 0,   \nspriteWidth, spriteHeight);   \ngameFrame ++;  \nrequestAnimationFrame(animate);  \n}  \nanimate();", "created_utc": "1661453494.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ilrpr8f", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_wxjvyl", "parent_id": "t1_ilrj9vf", "score": "1", "subreddit": "learnprogramming", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r7yd"}, {"author": "EntryLevelHuman00", "body": "It\u2019s interesting though, I\u2019ve written the code exactly as the person in the tutorial and the tutorial is only a month old.
