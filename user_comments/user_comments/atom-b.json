The Prusa took two evenings to put together, a few minutes to walk through the initial firmware setup wizard and live-adjust the Z axis, and in the 1.5 years I've had it I haven't had to touch it aside from basic maintenance. The default printer and filament profiles in PrusaSlicer are great so no fiddly tuning to be done there, either.\n\n> I want a printer that is reliable and that after being built, I don't have to tinker much on it. I am tired of having to adjust screws for bed leveling or any other typical normal issue on the standard chinese printer, would the voron fix that?\n\nIn short, yes. Assuming your components are of sufficiently good quality, once the kinks are worked out you shouldn't have to do any more messing with it in a mechanical sense outside of normal printer maintenance. Now that I've worked out the kinks my V2 has been problem-free. It hasn't regressed on me like my old Chinese Makerbot clone did. That thing was a constant mess (4-point bed leveling via screws should be illegal). My V2 is nothing like that hunk of junk.\n\nThe key here though is that \"working out the kinks\" part. It's a long enough, complex enough build that you will almost definitely overlook some things and have to redo them. The manual is better than most printer manuals, but it's not as detailed as a Prusa manual. Discord is very helpful here, as are build videos on Youtube. My V2 was printing decently well after initial assembly, but there were a number of small problems that I had to work through after that, some of which didn't show up - or I didn't notice - until after a few tens of hours of printing. Once fixed none of them have come back.\n\nSome people really struggle to debug their printers. As far as I can tell it's because they have bad components or they weren't careful during assembly. A lot of problems can be solved by just looking at the manual.\n\n> Once built, how much tinkering do I have to do with the firmware settings? I don't want to be spending days modifying firmware settings. How easy is that once the printer is built?\n\nMore than you would on a Prusa, which is tough to beat because it's just clicking the button to get through the first-time setup and then adjusting your Z height.\n\nThere are sample klipper configs that get you most of the way there, but you'll have to find them (search the Discord) and customize them for your exact setup. I'm not aware of a 100% drop-in, does-it-all klipper config for the BOM-stock V2 (though it could be out there). The one I used for the Spider didn't have filament load/unload, or a complete PRINT_START macro, much less the nice-to-have functions like mid-print filament swaps, a PRINT_END that parks the toolhead at the back, etc. You can search Discord for basically all of what you need, but it's far from turn-key like a Prusa.\n\nEven if you find a sample config that has it all there's still configuration and tweaking you cannot avoid. You'll have to flash an sd card for your pi. You'll have to build, configure, and flash klipper MCU firmware for your MCU (once, unless you want to update klipper down the road). You'll have to do things like manually configure offsets, calibrate your extruder, double-check that settings are correct for your specific hardware, etc. http://docs.vorondesign.com has guides for doing all of this and they're a huge help, but it is still much more work than following the Prusa firmware's very simple setup wizard.\n\nIf you've had to configure non-klipper firmware before you'll be relieved to know that all of your config is done through a simple text file on the pi. No need to re-build and re-flash every time you want to change something. It's really quick and easy to iterate on your firmware settings. It's 100% doable even if you've never customized printer firmware before.

I don't know if there's any Slic3r Replicator 2X profiles out there but it shouldn't be *too* awful to make your own.\n\nIf you are feeling really adventurous and have a raspberry pi (a pi zero is enough), klipper supports the atmega processor that these came with, and there's a generic mightyboard config in the github repo.

I'm not aware of any studies that have specifically looked at natural ability in language learning. I'm not sure how one would go about setting up a study for that; there's so many confounding factors and variables to control for. \n\nHowever, [Duolingo funded a study](http://static.duolingo.com/s3/DuolingoReport_Final.pdf) (suspicious territory already, I know) that showed that more time spent studying with the app resulted in a bigger improvement in score on two subsequent language exams. Point for effort having a meaningful effect, IMO. But what's interesting is that the distribution of the effectiveness of the study time (page 15) shows that over half of the participants had very similar improvement per hour spent studying with the app, and another 25% or so improved a bit faster. There were a few outliers who improved significantly faster, and maybe they're evidence of the power of natural ability, but perhaps they were random flukes, or they didn't follow study protocol (e.g. used other resources in addition to the app), or something else. Whatever the case they were definitely in the minority. There were also some who got worse, but the study explains that they were people who scored very high at the beginning of the study and could only go down, or they used the app at the start of the study but didn't touch it after that- implying that their skills had atrophied. \n\nThey look at a number of factors influencing the effectiveness and the only statistically significant one is the reason for learning a language. To me, that also hints at motivation outweighing natural ability. But it doesn't prove it. There's no controlling for selection bias at any stage of the study. Those who are gifted in language may be more likely to participate in and fully complete a two-month study, while those who struggle hard may give up and thus be excluded from the data entirely. People with a natural talent for language may be more likely to have the same reason for studying (those wanting to learn for \"travel\" had the biggest improvement per time spent studying).", "created_utc": "1604820353.0", "edited": "False", "id": "gbkpnnv", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_jplk3b", "parent_id": "t1_gbfy9i1", "score": "2", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "atom-b", "body": "A frequency dictionary of German from Routledge.

This is why all the serious sources that talk about how long this takes, such as the Goethe Institute, measure it in hours.\n\nFurthermore, the definition of fluent is almost entirely open to interpretation. I can carry on a conversation many topics so perhaps that's fluent? But not any topic, just ones I'm familiar with, so maybe not? How many topics should I be able to talk about off the top of my head before it counts as enough to be fluent? My conversation generally flows pretty well, which is a criteria for any sort of fluency, but sometimes I have to pause to think about how to formulate a thought. So maybe not smooth enough to be fluent? I (very) occasionally get compliments on my vocabulary when talking about current events and politics (thanks, ANKI!).

If you do a frequency analysis on news stories from the last 10 years, the words \"terrorism\" and \"economy\" are going to be near the top because the vast majority of news stories are at least somewhat related to at least one of those subjects.\n\nCompare that to a domain like \"fiction.\" Fiction has a much broader range of potential content and thus domain-specific vocabulary. Fantasy vocabulary is very different from contemporary mystery is very different from historical fiction is very different from science fiction. If you give both corpora equal weighting in your analysis, the narrow vocabulary of news media is going to stick out simply due to the repetitive nature of current events reporting.\n\nMy German frequency dictionary is a good example of this. There's a ton of legal and political jargon in the top 2000. \"Economy\" is in the 600s, \"terrorism,\" is in the 1600s. I've literally never encountered those words outside of news media.

Every day you have to review all the cards from the previous day, plus all cards from your entire ANKI history that happened to be scheduled for review that day. The larger your history, the more cards will be scheduled on that day.\n\nI'll try to give an example by tracking the cards that were first shown to you on day 1. I'll assume default (I think) interval settings, that you're only hitting \"good\", and that you're reviewing every single day.\n\n* Day 1 you had nothing to review and 20 new cards. \n* Day 2 you had 20 cards to review (they were new on day 1) and 20 new cards. \n* The day 1 cards now have an interval of 3 days, so you'll see them on day 5. \n* Day 5 rolls around. You see those 20 cards from day 1, plus the 20 new cards from yesterday (day 4). Today there were 40 cards in your review queue. \n* After your day 5 reviews the day 1 cards' interval grows to (coincidentally) 5 days. These cards will show up again on day 10. \n\nDay 10 is where it gets interesting:\n\n* The 20 day-1 cards show up as expected.\n* The 20 cards that were new on day 6 show up too- their interval became 3 days on day 7. \n* The 20 new cards from yesterday (day 9). \n\nSo on day 10 our review queue has reached 60 cards. This pattern continues into infinity. However, it's important to note that because the number of days between reviews of a given card increases with each review (1, 3, 5, ...) you get a logarithmic effect that causes the daily number cards to review to, essentially, level out.

There's probably truth to that, and you will very (very, very) occasionally pick up a word or phrase. But as someone who tried the \"listen from day one!\" thing, I think that people giving this advice have likely forgotten what it was like to be a true beginner, and/or aren't considering the opportunity cost of doing so. Of course *some* contact with the language is better than none, but that does not mean it is the best way to spend your time- especially if you find it tiring or frustrating to do.\n\nIn my experience there is a minimum threshold of knowledge you have to achieve before media consumption becomes worth your time. It can come relatively quickly- I don't know anything about Japanese, but I was able to understand very slow media meant for German learners, as well as the simplest of simple children's shows (stuff meant for 3 year olds), before finishing A1 (though I put a lot of time into building my vocab so that was probably closer to A2).\n\nOnce you're at that point you *absolutely* want to listen to as much comprehensible stuff as you can. Listening skill takes a while to develop, it's vital to everyday interaction, and natives in everyday conversation are surprisingly hard to understand. For my first few weeks in Germany it wasn't my A2 level that made things difficult. It was my inability to understand the fast, mumbling speech of normal face-to-face interactions. I'd done a lot of listening practice as preparation and had improved a ton, but casual native speech is a level of difficulty all its own. Especially if there's background noise, which there almost always is.\n\nSpeaking of improving your listening skill, that processing speed thing you mention takes time to develop. I found it most effective to slowly build up the difficulty. 10 hours of listening to challenging but comprehensible material did more for my listening ability than 50 hours of listening to incomprehensible stuff. Think of it like weight lifting- you don't start out trying to bench press 400lbs. You find a weight that's challenging but doable and gradually work your way up. Reading also helps with this because even though it doesn't train your ear, it does train your brain to process the language. \n\nUnfortunately, unlike weight lifting you can't really quantify your progress so you won't notice you're making any until you re-visit a piece of media that used to be too hard. Just have faith that if it's challenging but 90%+ comprehensible, you're making progress.\n\n> Do you have to learn a certain amount of words before you can start practising listening?\n\nIn my experience vocab is the biggest barrier to comprehending media.

Push yourself out of your comfort zone a bit. Force yourself to use more complicated constructions and new grammar rules. \n\nI'll add that improving these broader skills - reading, writing, listening, speaking - requires you to have a sufficient foundation in the basic elements. If you find that there's a very specific aspect to a particular facet of the language that is holding you back, such as a lack of vocabulary or grammar, then the optimal solution is to target that weakness until it isn't preventing you from progressing. Make some ANKI cards for the vocab you're missing (frequency dictionaries are a wonderful source of words), look up the grammar rule that is impeding your comprehension and/or production and do some exercises until you have a handle on it.

You probably already do this naturally without thinking about it.\n\nA good example of native German speech that is on the easy end of the spectrum is the narration on a show like Galileo. It's clearly spoken, not excitedly-fast, and uses standard language and standard sentence structure. The hosts are usually relatively easy to understand as well. The people they interview, however, are almost always the exact opposite. Less than perfect - if not downright mumbling - enunciation, lots of contractions and idioms and other shortcuts, and very rapid speech with half-finished and heavily interjected sentences. Z.B. \"When it comes to safety, well, you know, I would say that, actually, hmm, here's the thing, there's this problem you run into in this field - it's very hard to find qualified applicants or even interns who- well, mostly experienced professionals are what we're looking for, but maybe not other businesses in this field, it's a very diverse industry due to the history of the technology, so you'd have to talk to them, anyways safety is always a top priority...\". Throw in lots of \"\u00e4h...\" and other fillers and *tons* of particles. Particles everywhere. These are all very normal things that everyone does in their native language, but as a learner it makes them so much harder to understand.\n\nThe actual language aside I suggest doing whatever you can to make the learner feel comfortable interacting with you. Anxiety makes learning nearly impossible and will prevent someone from speaking at anywhere near their true ability level. Make it a forgiving, safe space to practice their language. Make it obvious you're enjoying the opportunity to help them. I forget even my canned A1 phrases when the B\u00e4ckerin scowls at me and, in a scolding, exasperated tone, tells me she can't understand me. In comparison I can have near-effortless conversations with the smiling, jovial guy running the Currywurst stand across the street.\n\nInterrupting someone with corrections is a bad idea; save them for when they're done expressing their thought. Interruptions break the train of thought which is still hard to maintain, and causes a little spike of anxiety at the exact wrong time. And don't put a lot of weight or focus on mistakes unless the person asks for clarification. Mention them with an \"oh by the way\" attitude and move on.\n\nTry to prioritize the mistakes you correct. Having several pointed out at once makes me much less likely to remember any of them, and sometimes makes me very self conscious. Personally, I'd rather be corrected on things that make me hard to understand or phrasing that sounds very foreign instead of stuff like declension mistakes. When I say \"Ein alten Hund,\" I didn't screw up the adjective declension because I don't know that it's \"der Hund,\" or that nominative masculine adjectives with an indefinite article get an \"-er\" ending. I messed it up because I don't have the instinctive ability to recall and use that information when I'm in the flow of speaking. It's not that there's no value in correcting this sort of mistake, but it isn't nearly as helpful as pointing out the awkward phrasing that made me really hard to understand.

Furthermore, you're smart to spend a considerable amount of time on it. My experience is that vocab is what unlocks the ability to do everything else- read, listen, speak, and absorb the grammar- so I'm a big fan of cramming as much of it into your brain as you can, as early as you can. If you don't know the words that are being said then you're not getting as much out of the content as you could be. That's the fun stuff and the fast you can get there the better. As much as I love ANKI, grinding flash cards isn't what I'd call fun.\n\nAt some point you'll find your weakest link to be something other than vocab so at that point you might want to spend less time on vocab and more on whatever you want to improve. CEFR vocab size estimates vary, but B2 is in the area of 5000 words. If that's your goal then you could throttle back a bit on you get there in order to free up more time for other things. Personally I haven't tried that because I'm still benefiting massively from the new words I'm adding, so I make that trade-off elsewhere.\n\nYou should experiment with different methods. Pick a method that intrigues you and spend 20 minutes a day trying it out. Give it a couple weeks and see what you think. That should be enough time to determine if you're benefiting. Finding a method that really 'clicks' with you is extremely beneficial in the long run.\n\nYour 2 hours are more regimented than my two hours, and on the whole you probably get more benefit from them because of it.

Right now that is mostly reading because I have a stack of very good books I'd like to get through, with a little bit of time spent on podcasts and youtube for listening practice because improving that will make my everyday interactions with native speakers much easier.

Your mileage may vary and I can imagine scenarios where TL subs are useful, such as forcing you to maintain a certain reading pace, or for checking one or two words that you didn't catch while ignoring them the rest of the time.

The lack of flexibility can be frustrating to others. A syllabus that focuses very heavily on grammar exercises is torture to some people. This kills motivation which is the exact opposite of what students want and need. A class that focuses on practicing practical usage and ignores grammar will bother those who like to dig in and understand the rules that underpin the language. Those who want to do something with the language from day one will prefer a course that emphasizes practical speaking exercises from the very beginning, but will be torture on people that are very nervous to speak in front of others.\n\n> My language class is Russian, and, as you may expect, the class focuses on one grammatical concept at a time with the aim of learning the fuck out of the grammar and select vocabulary, and we do tons of workbook exercises and such.\n\n> Idk, it counters what I prefer doing, which is just aiming for ability to converse and get past the basic stuff like, \u201chi I\u2019m American and I\u2019m learning Russian and I have 2 dogs and a job.\u201d ya know.\n\nI'm of the opinion that that grinding grammar exercises is overrated and is the downfall of many a language class and learner. You've run into one of the downsides of a course. But there's an argument to be made for putting early emphasis on grammar in some languages.\n\nI don't know Russian but I do know that, like German, it has noun genders and a case system. In German your ability to clearly express yourself beyond fixed expressions- and more importantly to understand what others are saying to you- is extremely limited without knowing your way around the case system and how it interacts with noun genders. If you speak a language that has both of those things then it probably isn't that much to learn and grammar drills won't be of much use. But if these are new concepts- which is likely the case (no pun intended) for many of your classmates- then putting up with *some* grind gets you to the good stuff faster. The earlier you learn the fundamentals the better off you'll be in the long run.\n\nThat doesn't mean grammar exercises can't still be overdone. My college intro to German class killed my motivation by spending a week on exercises that I mastered in half an hour, and diving into a bunch of grammatical minutia at the expensive of learning to do *anything* with the language.

Kudos for including one =) I drank the entire ANKI punch bowl, but I'd never say ANKI is guaranteed to be the best method for everyone. \n\nHow one uses ANKI also matters a great deal. I actually gave up on ANKI the first time I tried it because the premade, text-only, single-word, native <-> target decks did almost nothing for me. It wasn't until I discovered the right way for me to use it (make my own cards with images, audio, definitions, example sentences) that it became incredibly effective. This isn't to say that everyone who finds ANKI ineffective is just using it wrong, but that *can* be the case, and it's an important caveat to include when recommending it.\n\n> In my case, to really learn a world I need to use it many times in a conversation, that gives me context, anchors and associates it in my brain and gives me pronunciation feedback (further helping to anchor it)\n\nI think that this is true no matter the method you use for acquiring vocab. Studying vocab is a stepping stone for getting to the point where you can do the things that allow you to *truly* know a word. For me, ANKI works wonders for this.\n\nI'll add that I now exclusively use full sentences on my ANKI cards, and I include pronunciation examples, dictionary definitions, and even common word combinations. This really helps with developing that sense of context and provides many more 'hooks' for my brain to anchor to. It's still not a complete solution to truly knowing a word, but it's a much better start than single word translation cards. \n\n> My old method was to use large physical flashcards that could hold between 50-100 worlds and use these to refer to whilst having conversations with my language partner / teacher. That way i could speak with a greater level of fluency and after a few days / weeks would not need that card anymore.\n\nThis is an interesting approach I've never heard of before. You skip the stepping stone part and go straight to practicing in the moment. I don't think it'd work with my temperament - I like to feel prepared ahead of time, and I absolutely cannot stand the tedium of stopping to look things up when reading, listening, writing, or speaking - but I bet it'd work for a lot of people. You should consider making a new post dedicated to sharing and explaining the method.\n\n> With Anki, even when a card has become 'mature' I do not really know it, i either cannot recall it at all in a conversation, hear it and cannot remember its meaning or it takes 10 seconds to dig out of my memory.\n\nThat's interesting. Do you have production cards as well as comprehension cards? I have to have both, otherwise I can only go one way with the word. Still, I do find that I'm better at answering my ANKI cards than I am at spontaneously recalling and producing vocab. Not a *ton* better, but I occasionally go to add a word to my ANKI deck only to discover that it's already in there. There's something about the act of looking at my phone and seeing a picture that makes some words much easier to recall and produce.\n\nFor the words I struggle with it only takes 1-2 \"in the moment,\" uses before a word becomes deeply embedded and is never a problem again. These words tend to be abstract ones such as \"otherwise,\" \"meanwhile,\" and \"however,\" or verbs that are hard to visualize. Unfortunately these sorts of words make up a significant portion of the thousand most common words in a language, so this may explain some of your lackluster results from ANKI.\n\n> On top of this it takes a ages to make cards (with images)\n\nThis is definitely a downside, and the tedium is a deal breaker for many people. I can't fault them for that. A study method that you absolutely can't stand doing is never going to be effective. I automated part of the process and that's cut my card creation time in half. But image and sentence searching is still a manual process. However I have found that the time spent looking for good images and sentences can be valuable exposure to how a word is used. Digging through a few pages of google search results reveals a lot of nuance that a literal single-word translation cannot provide. Personally this is the biggest benefit to making my own cards. I get a much better feel for the ways in which word is used, and I can pick the example sentence(s) that best represent that. And occasionally by the time I finish making a card I know the word so well I don't need the card anymore. I'd never call it fun, but it's not so bad that I can't stand it, and it's paid massive dividends.", "created_utc": "1578344682.0", "edited": "False", "id": "fdeqt94", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_ekym4d", "parent_id": "t3_ekym4d", "score": "8", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "atom-b", "body": "Recalling vocabulary is a separate skill from recognizing it.

We have phenomenal ~~refreshments~~ recall rates. \n\nWriting is also really helpful for practicing full sentence production. Before you call your mom you should write a little bit about your day. That way you can look up any words you don't know but will need to express yourself (keep a list of these for the aforementioned vocab production practice), you get some practice formulating sentences from the individual words you know, and you get a bit of a warm-up. Have her correct this writing for you, but I suggest you only read it out-loud to her after you've had your daily chat. That way you're still getting practice at spontaneous speaking.\n\nBe prepared to be in this \"can't speak in complete sentences,\" spot for a while.

The opposite applies for a posh British accent. Though if they're both giving out advice on raising cattle the southerner will be judged as far more competent.\n\nAll that said, I have to believe that vocabulary and grammar are far more important.

This is probably due in part to the fact that [ease of understanding has a significant impact on how people perceive a speaker](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-brain-doubts-accent/), and poor grammar puts a lot more cognitive load on the listener than all but the thickest of foreign accents.", "created_utc": "1576793227.0", "edited": "False", "id": "fbet00p", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_ecq2l0", "parent_id": "t3_ecq2l0", "score": "2", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "atom-b", "body": "I had one elderly gentleman excitedly and cheerfully call me \"Ami!\" when he found out I was American.", "created_utc": "1576704059.0", "edited": "False", "id": "fbbnfgp", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_ebvw24", "parent_id": "t3_ebvw24", "score": "1", "subreddit": "German", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qq51"}, {"author": "atom-b", "body": "These don't have to be mutually exclusive.

You have to remember all the details for a bunch of disparate objects and the vague structure of who is affecting whom without picturing them doing anything. You know there's a girl, a cat, a ball that something is happening to, this something happened yesterday after 6pm just before dinner in the room next to the kitchen in the girl's grandmother's home in Berlin. Then when you get to the end of the sentence these nebulous, disconnected concepts have to *immediately* come into focus, join the same scene, and perform whatever verb decided to show up in the appropriate way. On top of that there are often a few verbs stacked on the end so the whole thing must be completely re-evaluated multiple times over, instantaneously. I even struggle with this when speaking. Sometimes I get to the end of a sentence and have forgotten the verb(s) I was going to use.

Even if natives use sentences that are super-basic, they're going to be much faster and not pronounced as clearly.

Native speakers are ridiculously good at their languages and they don't know their own power level.\n\n> Often times, when I practice my listening, I can hear many words that I know, but I can't put all of the words from the sentence together. \n\n\"Many\" words is often not enough. Missing just one word in a short sentence usually means you miss the entire sentence. The first hurdle to listening is vocabulary, and that just takes time to grind out.\n\n> This especially happens when I listen to a dialogue longer than one or two sentences.\n\nAre you translating things in your head? If so, you need to work on not doing that. Listening is impossible if you have to translate. This skill takes practice and time so be patient with it.\n\nThe ability to synthesize information from a sentence is a skill. It's the same skill whether you're reading or listening to the language, so start with reading. You can go as slow as you need to and re-read something as many times as you want, which is important because if the input is incomprehensible then it's essentially worthless. That's why A1-level graded readers are the perfect place to start. Just remember to focus on visualizing the information and no matter what do *not* translate what you're reading. Go as slow as you need to in order to do this. It'll probably be hard work at first. When I first started to read I found that a paragraph of the most simple sentences imaginable took a large amount of focus to properly understand. But after a few hundred pages of level-appropriate graded readers it'll be much easier for you to synthesize sentences into information.\n\nNext, find audio content that is extremely simple and spoken ridiculously slowly and clearly. Again, if you can't comprehend what you're hearing then it isn't helping. Peppa Pig is my go-to suggestion for those who are *just* starting to work on listening. Hours and hours of incomprehensible content didn't do anything for my listening, but a couple hours of Peppa worked *wonders*. It opened up a ton of more challenging learners content for me. Given how popular Spanish is there are probably some extremely simple learners podcasts out there. Just remember that if you can't understand the majority of what you're hearing, it's too complex to be of much use so you should set it aside for now and keep looking. You'll get there eventually.\n\nThe act of turning sounds into words is its own skill which is unique to listening. It is a totally unconscious one that your brain has to develop by itself. It will happens with exposure and time.\n\nLastly, when you're going through all this remember that the process is mostly unconscious. You won't notice improvements from day to day or week to week.

After hours and hours of watching videos and tv shows in German everything was just as incomprehensible as when I started. Studying vocab paid much bigger dividends much more quickly. Once I could understand the majority of what I was hearing my listening skills began to very quickly. A few hours of listening made a noticeable difference. But so much of listening is an unconscious thing that it's hard to say for sure that there was zero benefit from the incomprehensible input.\n\nThe value of comprehensible input became crystal clear to me when I had to produce the language after a few weeks of only reading and listening. I was magically better at speaking and writing despite having spent absolutely no time practicing either. Currently I only have occasion to speak and write German once a week, but if I get in several hours of reading and listening in the intervening days then there is a noticeable improvement in my output. It's a totally unconscious thing and very strange to experience.\n\nI'll also add that there's a non-obvious psychological element that affects the value of early production practice. Krashen mentions it in an interview I happened across on YouTube. Even if we assume that production from day one is very effective, if doing it makes you anxious then it is worthless. Our brains aren't learning when we're scared and/or miserable. When that's the place you're at then input can only be more effective. \n\nWhat I have found focused study to be useful for is unlocking comprehension, as well as some very basic, fundamental production ability. You need the vocab to understand anything and ANKI is incredibly efficient at accomplishing that in comparison to slowly absorbing it through context (some people will argue that context is the only way to truly understand all the nuances of a word's meaning, and that's true, but studying vocab teaches you enough that you can bootstrap you to the point where you can quickly absorb those nuances). Producing individual words also feels like a separate skill, and ANKI works wonders for that as well.

You'll get there eventually.\n\nIf that's the case then there are much easier books than HP to start with. I suggest a graded reader meant for your level- A1 if you're a beginner. Your brain's ability to synthesize language into actual meaning is a skill in and of itself. You can have an intellectual understanding of all the vocab and grammar in a sentence yet still have to work to fully comprehend it. Fighting against that as well as unknown vocab and grammar will make things much more frustrating. A couple weeks of reading graded readers where I knew virtually all the vocab and grammar did *wonders* for my ability to convert sentences and paragraphs into meaning, and made it possible for me to read stuff on the level of Harry Potter.\n\nAs for ANKI, I only add words I don't know already, or occasionally an alternative meaning of a word. In descending order of priority I select words from my lessons, a frequency dictionary, a wordlist for a given CEFR level, words that are personally relevant to how I want to use the language (I have a lot of words related to politics because I listen to news podcasts, for example), words I keep encountering but can never remember, and words that I come across that I find interesting and want to add to my toolbox. I also add cards that test grammar if I'm having trouble remembering something (such as an irregular verb conjugation). \n\nI recommend putting some of that extra time into making really good ANKI cards. Images, pronunciation example audio, dictionary definitions, and - once you have enough vocab for them to be useful - fill-in-the-blank sentences. [The Fluent Forever ANKI guides show you how to do this](https://blog.fluent-forever.com/chapter2/), and it's how I do it. Doing this takes a lot more work and time than simple native <-> target language cards; sometimes I spend an hour making 15 cards because it takes a while to find the perfect example sentence and picture. But that's actually very valuable exposure to the word in a bunch of different contexts, and it's why I count time spent creating the cards as study time.\n\nPlus, the extra effort up front has saved me a TON of time in the long run. My cards teach me a lot more than a simple English translation of a word (I actually don't put any English on my cards). The images feed my brain a *conceptual* meaning instead of a literal English translation, and they make the word easier to remember. The pronunciation examples train my ear and pronunciation skills. The sentences and definitions give context to the word and also ensure I read hundreds of target language sentences every day. Instead of having to set aside time to do all that separately I get it just by reviewing my daily card review.\n\nYou could also spend time creating more ANKI cards. In the beginning you'll find vocab to be your biggest bottleneck so you could try going for 20 or 30 new words a day, then backing off to 7-10 once you're sick of that pace or have other things to fill your time with.\n\nBeyond extra ANKI time a beginners textbook and grammar book are good places to start. There's a lot more to language than vocab and those will give you a path to follow. Since you plan on using the language when traveling a travel phrasebook could be a good option, though a good learners textbook will cover some of that. Everyday life has lots of essential, commonly used fixed expressions that, even if you know all the words, have non-obvious meanings and you would never create them on your own. \n\nSearch Youtube and Google for lessons meant for absolute beginners.", "created_utc": "1570739608.0", "edited": "1570741083.0", "id": "f38svig", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_deugg3", "parent_id": "t1_f38ado1", "score": "1", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "atom-b", "body": "Gladly! \n\nI'm not personally familiar with how difficult/complex Swedish is, but the FSI guidelines put it in the \"easy\" category so I suspect 1-2 hours of study a day will get you to B1 by then.

You'll have to experiment a bit to find your sweet spot.

If you want to pass a B1 certificate exam in a year, and B1 in your target language requires a passive vocabulary of about 2500 words, then you need to learn at least 7 new words per day.

It's pretty common with the perfect tense. Generally speaking verbs get a \"ge-\" prefix in the perfect tense, but a number of common verb prefixes cause the verb to drop the \"ge-\". For example, in the perfect tense \"machen\" becomes \"gemacht\" as expected, but \"*be*machen\" is just \"bemacht.\" That \"gebe-\" combo just feels awkward to say. And this applies to all verbs starting with \"be-\" - none of them get the \"ge-\" prefix in the perfect tense. In fact, every prefixed verb that would normally end up with a \"ge[prefix]-\" in perfect tense is an exception to the \"ge-\" rule, and all of those double prefixes make the word more awkward to pronounce. At least for me.\n\nInterestingly enough there's another list of verb prefixes where the \"ge-\" actually goes between the prefix and the root verb. \"anmachen\" becomes \"angemacht.\" \"Ange-\" is nowhere near as awkward to say as \"gean-.\" These prefixes are terribly disloyal and will take every opportunity they can to put space between themselves and their verbs.

That there are so many ways to do \"immersion,\" and the effectiveness and especially *practicality* of those things will vary a lot on an individual basis, means that it's impossible to make definitive declarations about the effectiveness of any specific approach. As you've pointed out, AJATT is very impractical for many people so you can't just tell everyone \"AJATT is the best!\" But for someone who can fit it into their life, it may be the bee's knees. Or it may be very ineffective because their learning style or temperament isn't suited to it.\n\nThe one thing that all these immersion approaches have in common AND also applies to everyone is that they're almost entirely about spending time exposed to (mostly comprehensible) input.

Don't beat yourself up for not being perfect, but you should be paying attention to it from the beginning.\n\n* Pronunciation can be very important to being understood. Many of us English speakers have struggled to understand to a customer service agent with an incredibly thick Indian accent. But your accent doesn't have to be that severe in order to be misunderstood. Unlike many English speakers, a lot of natives aren't used to hearing their language with a foreign accent. I've had Germans give me confused stares when I make what my ear perceives as a small pronunciation mistake. Only when I repeat the word extremely slowly while being very careful to nail the pronunciation do they understand. This isn't a universal problem, but I've been surprised at how commonly it occurs. \n\n* A small change in pronunciation can have a big effect on meaning. There's a thread on the front page of the sub all about how the Spanish word for \"years\" is one accented 'n' away from the word \"anus.\" In German, \"schw\u00fcl\" means \"humid\" and \"schwul\" is homosexual. Those two dots make (to the English ear) a small difference in pronunciation but a huge difference in meaning. And of course in tonal languages proper pronunciation is absolutely key to proper communication.\n\n* A bad accent can make it unpleasant to talk to you. Even if you're understood, someone who has to put in extra effort to understand you is less likely to want to speak with you, help you, work with you in a professional context, etc. A thick accent can also be grating to the ear.\n\n* Good pronunciation makes you seem more competent. Or rather, poor pronunciation can make you seem less competent in terms of both your target language skills and in general. That can have big implications for many aspects of your life including professionally.\n\n* Somewhat relatedly, proper pronunciation makes you less of an outsider. It's a subtle, even unconscious, display of belonging, empathy, and respect. Conversely someone who isn't even trying to say things right can come off as arrogant and uncaring.\n\n* The worse your pronunciation, the more likely someone is to switch to English. This is a real pain in the ass if you're trying to practice.\n\n* It takes a long time to develop proper pronunciation so you want to start early. Even if you don't think breaking bad habits will be hard down the road it still takes a lot of time to get it right so you might as well pay attention from the start. \n\nI say \"pay attention,\" because you don't have to do much more than that to make progress. Pay attention to how words are supposed to be pronounced and try to mimic that when you speak. Practice pronouncing words properly when you study vocab. If you use example sentences then read those out loud too. None of that takes any extra time and you'll be on your way to getting good instead of standing completely still. If you're using ANKI, take a little extra time to add the IPA and, ideally, a pronunciation example to your flash cards.

When it comes to vocab acquisition SRS is ridiculously effective compared to reading (the usual caveat of 'use whatever works best for you' applies here; some people just can't stand to use SRS).

Many of the words in a book just aren't used frequently enough to stick (though I find cognates tend to be an exception to this).\n\nI'll add that SRS is still ridiculously effective for the abstract words, even if it isn't a complete solution. A study method can be massively beneficial without meeting someone's arbitrary definition of \"perfect.\" Learning one or two uses of a word is enough to bootstrap you into comprehending most, if not all, of the various meanings and usages when you encounter them 'in the wild.' \n\nMy favorite example is actually a word that isn't even that abstract- the German word for \"driving,\" as in \"driving a car.\" In German one also \"drives\" a bike (among other things). If you only know the usage in the context of driving a car but then you come across a sentence where someone is \"driving a bike,\" it's very easy to make that connection. That meaning or usage of \"driving,\" also sticks much better because it builds on a definition you already know. This is a very different outcome compared to the scenario where you don't any of the meanings/usages of the German word for \"driving.\"\n\nAlso, the results of SRS speak for themselves.

In an ideal world where everything is fun and interesting there is probably a more efficient way to do it, but I learn nothing when i'm bored or frustrated. Fortunately I've found that working on one skill improves the others. I went on along reading binge a while back, completely ignoring writing and speaking. When I got back to writing I noticed immediately that it was easier to do than ever before and I was using more complex sentence structure without even think about it.\n\nI'm finally at the point now where a lot of media is comprehensible. It's fun so naturally most of my remaining time is spent on this. I was reading a lot, and still do, but I've recently realized that my poor listening skills are a real hindrance to my use of the language so I've begun spending more time on podcasts, tv shows, and internet streams.\n\nWhen I'm curious about some piece of grammar I'll look it up in my grammar book, do an exercise or two, and maybe make some ANKI cards to test myself. Half an hour of grammar study is a cheap price for unlocking a deeper understanding of a lot of content and enabling a lot of expressiveness.\n\nWhen I feel inspired I'll write something, making an effort to use whatever new grammar I'm trying to learn or improve on.\n\nI pay for lessons in order to practice speaking, get writing corrections, get answers to any questions I have, and get exposure to the subject matter that is most relevant to what I want to use the language for.", "created_utc": "1564394819.0", "edited": "1564395360.0", "id": "evbua60", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_cixism", "parent_id": "t3_cixism", "score": "2", "subreddit": "German", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qq51"}, {"author": "atom-b", "body": "Sometimes it's a problem, but usually not. Context helps avoid confusion. But even if the meaning were correctly conveyed 100% of the time it's unpleasant to the ear and makes for more work on the part of the listener. You really need to learn the article with the word.\n\nAs for some places where things can go wrong: \n\nSome words have a very different meaning depending on gender, such as der/die/das Band. \n\nSome words don't change in the plural and so the plural articles are how you distinguish them- das Kissen is one pillow, die Kissen is multiple pillows.\n\nA feminine noun in the Dativ and Genitiv has the same article (der) as a masculine noun in the Nominativ. Saying \"der Katze\" when you meant \"die Katze\" can significantly affect the meaning of a sentence. Same goes for confusing masculine and neuter when using the 'ein' words in Nominativ and Akkusativ. \"ein Hund\" is *always* the subject of the sentence. \n\nIf you screw up the gender of the referential pronouns you might confuse someone, and if you don't know the gender then you may be confused when someone else uses the correct ones.

In my A1 book there was a lot of content - especially vocab - that was very specific to students looking to study abroad. That took up a lot of time which could have been better spent on things more relevant to me as an adult who's already graduated college, and especially stuff that is more related to my medium-term goal. Compared to the vocab I picked up from the A1 materials, learning the top 1000 words of a frequency dictionary paid way bigger dividends in terms of getting me to the point where I could read interesting stuff. I'm going to encounter the 334th most common German word (\"although\") *way* more than I'll encounter the word for \"outdoor swimming pool,\" but only the latter was in my A1 book.\n\nA friend of mine had a similar experience in her B1 course: they spent weeks covering the entire German childcare and education systems. She doesn't have kids and doesn't want them, and already has an advanced degree, so there's a ton of stuff she had to learn that isn't relevant and isn't interesting- which not only delays her getting to her eventual goal (consuming native content) but also makes it harder to absorb. That content was very relevant to the immigrant mothers in her course, but was a complete miss for her.\n\nNow, some of the targeted subject matter is still useful to us. Day-to-day life stuff like shopping and making appointments has been valuable to both of our circumstances. And the stuff that isn't relevant still serves as a vehicle for exposure to the language, grammar, etc. But it's suboptimal.\n\nAtmosphere is a huge thing in a classroom environment. One of the few advantages of a classroom (IMO) is that it can be a safe space to practice face-to-face interaction in the language while receiving corrections. But for that to work people need to feel safe. They need to feel like it's okay to make mistakes. They need to see their classmates making the same mistakes. If the classroom doesn't feel like that, then the reverse happens. People are more anxious than they would be on their own or with a private tutor. Anxiety undermines learning. Anxiety also causes you to make a ton of mistakes you wouldn't otherwise have made. When I screw up a regular verb conjugation which I've done correctly thousands of times before it's because I was nervous and distracted trying to avoid making any mistakes, not because I've forgotten the basic rules of conjugation. Being corrected on that is a waste of everyone's time.\n\nStuff like acting out a short scene in front of the class is terrifying for many people in their *native* language, and it's no better in a foreign language. They'll do rote memorization of the thing just hoping to get through it without embarrassing themselves. How much learning is going on there? Small classroom sizes help with this not only because it's fewer eyes on you, but it's easier to get to know people and thus become comfortable with them.

Near the end of A1 I could get ~70-80% of super-simple kids stuff such as Peppa Pig, but it was a waste of time before then. It had to be extremely simple. A lot of kids stuff was still incomprehensible. \n\nSomewhere in the A2-B1 range most spoken content meant for adult native speakers is almost completely incomprehensible. The exception being stuff that isn't too complicated and I'm somewhat familiar with already. Non-fiction content like educational science and engineering shows, for example, are surprisingly understandable. Dubbed sitcom reruns are tougher, but the subjects are never that complicated and the actors generally speak clearly and don't talk over each other so a broad understanding is very possible.

But overall I know enough to understand what's going on and for the book as a whole to be an enjoyable read.\n\nWhile there are some optimizations you can make (focusing on fantasy-relevant vocab, etc.) there is no way around the fact that it will take hundreds of hours to get there. Does reading Moers as it was originally written provide enough motivation for you to stick it out for the long haul? Are you interested in all the other phenomenal German literature that's out there? What about all the other wonderful reasons to learn a second language?", "created_utc": "1562598315.0", "edited": "1562598647.0", "id": "et9jcn4", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_c4wjgi", "parent_id": "t3_c4wjgi", "score": "1", "subreddit": "Zamonia", "subreddit_id": "t5_2xcxp"}, {"author": "atom-b", "body": "So my thoughts about college language courses aren't based on anything but my personal experience, and the opinions I've read online, so it is in no way scientific or conclusive. A lot of what I'm going to say is a repeat of things other people have said on this subreddit before. So, with that in mind...\n\nIn the beginning there's a terrible over-emphasis on grammar. This comes at the expense of everything else- most importantly, vocab. Consequently, you can't do a thing with the language even after months of 'learning' it. For most people this is tedious, boring, and frustrating. Perhaps even worse it delays those precious little moments of gratification that are so incredibly important for motivation. Your first \"Oh my god I just heard a sentence and understood it all!\" is something that can't happen if you don't know any of the words in that sentence.\n\nHaving the German article tables and conjugation rules for several verb tenses burned into my brain would eventually be useful, but it was a horribly tedious slog to get there and I had zero to show for it. After a semester of German I couldn't have ordered a coffee much less understand a single non-cognate on the cafe menu. Personally, this made language learning a miserable experience for me, I learned nothing, thus assumed I was incapable of learning languages and then gave up on it for *years*.\n\nIn a class you can't tailor your learning to what works best for you or areas that are of interest to you. You're locked in to the track set by the course. Some people benefit immensely from this sort of guidance and accountability. To them I would strongly recommend trying a class. However, if the approach taken by the class doesn't suit you, or if the materials are bad, or if you don't need to drill the same grammar rule 35 times to get it, then you're going to have a tougher time learning. We don't learn when we're bored, frustrated, anxious, or tired. But a class will make no allowances for that. Outside of a class you can custom tailor your learning so that it is highly optimized for getting you exactly what you want out of the language.\n\nFor example: A friend of mine is taking an intensive German course right now. She's getting frustrated with it because they're learning all sorts of stuff related to child care, the German school system, and the associated bureaucracy. That's great if you have kids. But she and her husband don't have children, and they don't want them. She *needs* to be learning German that's relevant to navigating the hiring processes of German businesses, and she *wants* to be able to read fantasy novels. Unfortunately the class requires so much time that she cannot dedicate much time to developing her vocabulary and general knowledge of those areas. \n\nNow that isn't to say these lessons are worthless. It's still exposure to the language, there will be some shared vocabulary, and there is speaking practice to be had. But it is far from optimal.\n\nLarger classroom environments with 10+ people are also a problem. You get very little opportunity for pronunciation and speaking practice. When you do it is often very intimidating. It's very common to have to speak in front of the class, either by yourself or with a partner. The vast majority of people are absolutely terrified of public speaking in their *native* language, much less one they're learning.\n\nAll of that said, I have recently had a very positive classroom experience. That's because almost everything is the opposite of what I wrote above. Our textbook is much more heavy on vocab and hardly ever mentions grammar. The subject matter is (mostly) relevant to me- I'm getting around Germany just fine with what I've learned and that's exactly what I wanted out of the course. It's an evening course that is only 4 hours a week and light on homework so I have plenty of time to also study what I want. The class is not for credit and we are not graded so if I only do some of the grammar exercises, or I decide to write something that doesn't perfectly follow the subject of a writing assignment, who cares? I'm the one paying them and I don't need credits or a certificate from them. The teacher is very good and supportive of all of this. There's only a handful of students so we get quite a bit of personal attention and the lesson plans are tweaked to better suit us.", "created_utc": "1562579685.0", "edited": "False", "id": "et90bku", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_c367la", "parent_id": "t1_es6dayr", "score": "1", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "atom-b", "body": "Cool!

I only have a vague idea of what is and isn't obscure vocabulary, for example.

That a ton of the most common German words look very similar to each other but often mean distinctly different things, and many of them are synonyms (which may or may not look alike) didn't help.

There was nothing easy about Easy German even at the end of my A1 class. I set it aside because I wasn't getting anything out of it. Now, after a couple months of 2 hours of study per day it's quite (but not 100%) understandable to me. You'll get there as long as you keep practicing.\n\nBegin wall of text: \n\nWhen I say study I mean things like grinding frequency list vocab with ANKI, reading and listening to A1 graded readers and the [Nachrichtenleicht podcast](https://nachrichtenleicht.de), and watching the simplest kids show I could find (Peppa Pig). I still don't pick up 100% of Easy German- probably 80-95% depending on the video- and it's not effortless. But I get enough that it is entertaining, educational, and useful instead of a frustrating chore. In fact just this minute I re-watched an Easy German video that was severely discouraging to me near the end of my A1 course. Back then I completely failed to understand it despite it being about topics we had just covered in class. Today I actually understand it!\n\nListening is weird. It's not like memorizing vocab and grammar where you can easily see progress. Yesterday you didn't know a word or rule, then you deliberately practiced it, and now today you know it. Very straightforward. Listening improvement just sort of... happens. You won't notice the progress until you revisit previously unintelligible content (like I just did). Now, a big part of that improvement is growing your vocab. If you don't know the words you can't understand what's being said. Keep on grinding that vocab. However, there's no shortage of sentences in which you'll know all the words and grammar yet still not understand them at the speed they're spoken. With time and exposure to content you (mostly) understand your brain gets better at that part all on its own. Feed it *comprehensible* input and it figures out the rest. Just keep in mind that at A1 there is very little content that is comprehensible to you simply due to your limited vocab and grammar. Learning materials cover a massive range of skill levels and most of it isn't aimed at the A1 or A2 level. That's okay.\n\nIn my experience reading actually helps with this. If you still struggle to comprehend beginner's audio sources in which you know all the words and grammar, graded readers will serve as a stepping stone. When I started with A1-level graded readers I had to go slow and really concentrate to build a picture in my mind of what each sentence was describing. I knew the words and grammar but extracting the real meaning was a very conscious, active process requiring a lot of focus. But the more I read the easier it became. This was an entirely subconscious process just like listening. I didn't realize I was improving until I went back and re-read the stuff I had started with and it was so damn easy. I hadn't been practicing listening at the time (not for any particular reason) and yet when I revisited a graded reader audiobook I *immediately* noticed my listening comprehension was much better.\n\nMy (totally unfounded, unscientific, and likely dead wrong) theory is that this is because once a sentence has gone from text or sound to disorganized information bouncing around in the brain, the process by which that information is comprehended is the same. Listening will train the actual sound -> raw information conversion process. You absolutely need exposure to mostly-comprehensible content for your brain to get better at that. But the information -> understanding process is also necessary, and it certainly *feels* like it's the same mental muscle that's used when you read.\n\n/wall-o-text", "created_utc": "1559334083.0", "edited": "False", "id": "epnvkee", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_bv4jes", "parent_id": "t1_epmzb7p", "score": "4", "subreddit": "German", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qq51"}, {"author": "atom-b", "body": "Any specific advice for making that as successful as possible?

That is going to be necessary to understand the grammar they're trying to teach you- and you *will* need at least a passing familiarity with that grammar to quickly get to the point where you can understand German sentences. Fortunately those words will generally be fairly concrete (\"apple\", \"walking\", etc.) and thus easier to learn. Also many of them will also be among the most frequently used words in the language.\n\nIf you care about current events you'll get a lot of value by focusing on the vocabulary that is frequently used in the news.

All 4000 words in that dictionary are probably also extremely common, but I haven't gotten to them yet =)\n\nHowever, I suggest you wait on that vocab until you have some grammar and more concrete vocab under your belt. A lot of vocab used in the news is quite abstract- words such as \"furthermore\", \"however\", \"until,\", \"still\" etc. They tend to not have perfect translations to English, context can change their meaning, and I'm opposed to putting *ANY* native language on your flash cards- you want to train your brain to understand, not translate. That last one is somewhat of a personal preference though; some people insist on using native language on their flashcards.\n\nAssuming you dedicate an hour or two every day it won't take terribly long to get to the point where you can use sentences for learning these abstract words in context.

It's actually close to impossible until you have practiced it a lot. This is a matter of physiology- your brain has wired itself to not differentiate between the two sounds. For native English speakers 'u' vs. '\u00fc' comes to mind as one example. It's certainly the hardest one for me to recognize. I don't know if English has more of these than most other languages, but it has enough to be a real pain. And naturally if you can't hear a sound then it's impossible to produce properly.\n\nEven if you can clearly recognize a sound, producing it can still be hard. For example, for English speakers the ich-laut and uvular fricative R can take quite a bit of practice to get right. I still struggle to say 'sprechen' properly. Additionally, English vowels behave slightly differently than German ones. English vowels tend to change as you say them. German vowels will generally stay the same from start to finish. English's \"boat\" vs. German's \"Boot\" is a good example. Even if you know this is a thing and can hear the difference, the muscle memory from English is all sorts of wrong for German.

In fact if you find specific goals to be helpful then break that definition down into multiple milestones. Talking about the weather is much easier than talking about global politics or philosophy (or geopolitical philosophy). Same for the complexity of the conversation, and the ease with which you take part in it. Spontaneously and effortlessly expressing nuanced thoughts and opinions using complex sentences without pauses or grammatical mistakes is a much higher bar than speaking in simple, halting sentences.\n\nAfter 3-4 months (~180-240 hours) I could, with only a few pauses and grammatical mistakes, use simple vocabulary to describe a number of subjects in complete but short sentences. The weather is a good example. \"It's raining and grey. It is very cold. Do you like stormy weather?\" I could understand someone else's slightly more complex descriptions if they spoke clearly, not too quickly, and didn't use slang or idioms. That is technically a conversation about the weather. Not a fluid or highly satisfying one, but it qualifies.\n\nI couldn't express nuance. I couldn't talk about how the stormy weather was unusual for this time of year and that we rarely get thunderstorms here. That even though I like storms I still hope the weather forecast is correct and the storms will clear before my camping trip this weekend. And I certainly couldn't express these thoughts in spontaneous, complex, error-free sentences. \n\nAfter ~8 months (480 hours) my sentences are more complex and use more nuanced vocabulary. I can express more abstract ideas such as making comparisons and predictions. Nothing near the complexity that a native can produce, and my speaking isn't effortless or entirely free of errors, but I'm a lot closer to that than I used to be. \n\nYou can think of this whole language learning thing as building a house.

In fact you should probably take some time to understand noun gender, the basics of the case system, personal pronouns, and standard verb conjugations. You don't have to master all of those things up front, but understanding the gist of them will make sentences a lot less confusing. Still, feel free to skip them for now. It's easy to get bogged down, and thus bored and frustrated, by grammar.\n\nGoethe's website has level-specific vocab lists so get the one for A1. Even better, buy the textbook you'll be using and start mining it for vocabulary. Be sure to learn each noun with its definite article (der/die/das) and plural form.

Having an actual back-and-forth conversation is much harder than basic 'get by' functional stuff like ordering food, buying stuff at the store, asking for directions, etc. For the latter, once you can put together simple sentences and know how to ask people to repeat themselves more slowly, then you just need the appropriate vocab and the relevant phrases for these sorts of scenarios. If you explicitly studied only those handful of scenarios for 1-2 hours a day every day, then, assuming a relatively easy target language, my (very rough) guesstimate is that you could get there in 2-3 months from scratch without a problem. But still it really depends on how broad your definition of 'get by' is. If you want to be able to handle pretty much anything that could come up while traveling (this is one of the components of the B1 level) then it'll take you quite a bit longer.\n\nOverall, if you're spending your time wisely - and you are because you use ANKI ;) - then you can make very good progress at 1-2 hours per day.

The simple answer is practice. It really is a different skill than comprehension- especially for vocab. SRS (ANKI) is a godsend for vocab production.\n\nAs a mild aside, I find myself wondering if a disparity in production vs. comprehension skill is something we need to stress over. I recently spent a few weeks where, aside from my ANKI reviews, all my study time was spent on reading and listening. During this time I didn't write or speak at all. This wasn't intentional, that's just where my moods and life circumstances took me. As expected both my reading and listening comprehension improved noticeably.\n\nWhat I *didn't* expect was that after these few weeks writing had become easier than ever. Using familiar grammar was easier, and I could immediately produce some of the new vocab I'd picked up. Even better, I was using new grammatical constructs that I'd never practiced in my life. I still had to think a bit about how to do this without errors (double-checking case, gender, and verb locations), and I still made a few mistakes, but I had internalized the core concepts. I 'just knew' how to express myself in ways I had never studied or practiced. More importantly, the couple people I had review the piece told me it was by far the best German I'd ever written. I hadn't practiced writing, and yet my writing skill had improved. While I haven't had a ton of opportunity to test it, I feel like my speaking is a bit better too.\n\nThe point of that wall of text is to say that as your comprehension improves via exposure to the language so too will your production (how much may depend on your level, I can't say). Improvement is what matters, and as long as both are moving forward you're doing it right, no matter how far apart your skills are. Note that I'm not saying production practice is worthless or unnecessary. If you want or need your writing and speaking to be better, then yes you should practice them. They'll get better.

In German, the case of a noun indicates the role that the noun plays.**\n\nIf you know a bit of English grammar you know we describe these roles with the terms 'subject,' 'direct object' and 'indirect object.' Word order and prepositions tell us what role the nouns have. Compare 'The boy gives the dog the ball' to 'The boy gives the ball to the dog' and 'The dog gives the ball to the boy.' As you can see, noun order and prepositions indicate who is doing what to whom.\n\nWith a case system it isn't the order of the nouns that matters. Instead, nouns 'transform' to indicate their role in the sentence, including possession of something (genitive case). There's more to it than this - for example case also controls things like location and motion - but that's the gist of it. Case indicates the role a noun plays in a sentence. **When you want to express one thing acting on another, you use case instead of word order to communicate who's doing the action and who's affected by the action.**\n\nEnglish has a tiny remnant of a case system in its personal pronouns. **I** give the ball to **him**. **He** gives the ball to **me**. **They** saw **us**. **We** saw **them**. This doesn't override the word order (I'd still interpret the sentence 'us saw they' as 'we saw them' instead of 'they saw us'), but English pronouns must 'agree' with the role they play in the sentence.", "created_utc": "1557947290.0", "edited": "1557949894.0", "id": "ennis5b", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_bp0mwp", "parent_id": "t3_bp0mwp", "score": "1", "subreddit": "German", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qq51"}, {"author": "atom-b", "body": "I recently had a similar experience when trying to use the little bit of highschool Spanish that I remember.

Lifting 500lbs is less difficult than lifting 1000lbs, but it's still quite hard and requires a lot of training to get there. Depending on what you count as a 'word' and the language in question, toddlers have a comprehension vocabulary of several thousand words and [6 year olds can comprehend potentially tens of thousands of words](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vocabulary_development). That's a fairly large vocabulary for a language learner. \n\nThe domain of that vocabulary matters too. Kid shows use kid-relevant vocabulary. As a language learner you're learning adult-relevant vocabulary. All that travel vocab you covered in your first couple language classes isn't going to come up very often on Sesame Street.\n\nAlso don't forget that \"children's shows\" encompasses a wide variety of content with a huge range of target audiences- and therefore difficulties. Stuff meant for a 3 year old is much easier than stuff meant for a 10 year old. I can understand German Peppa Pig quite well. The vocab and grammar are very simple and the voice actors speak very clearly and slowly.

All the grammar study in the world won't allow you to understand a sentence in which you don't know any of the words. This is really important because *understanding and producing new stuff is the fun, satisfying part of this process*. You can't have those insanely gratifying moments of \"oh my god I'm learning something!\" without vocab. Plus there's a *LOT* more words than there are grammar rules so it's best to get started as early as possible =)\n\nThat isn't to say that grammar is unnecessary. Quite the contrary. It's incredibly useful, even critical, to comprehension. Even simple German sentences can be incomprehensible if you don't know a little about noun genders and the case system, for example. Those who unconditionally preach that studying grammar is useless are giving out bad advice, IMO. Different strokes for different folks, but if you're completely unfamiliar with concepts such as noun gender and cases (as almost all monolingual English speakers are) then most of German is locked off to you until you figure them out. A learner who reads a blog post about the basics will have save themselves countless hours of frustration and bewilderment that they can instead spend cramming vocab into their head.\n\nThe real problem is the way grammar is taught and, to a lesser extent, the way people try to learn it. A passing familiarity is all that's required in the beginning. \"Hey here's a rule, here's how it affects meaning, now be on the lookout for it.\" That unlocks the door to comprehension, which enables intuitive production. Heck just knowing it's a thing means that if you want to use the rule in your writing then you know it exists and can go look it up.\n\nInstead many teachers will drill students over and over again, trying to ensure they have a ridiculously exhaustive knowledge of all the intricacies of a wide array of grammar rules. Drills are a grind for most people and the lack of vocab means very little practical comprehension ability is being acquired early on.

Because it is not forced on the vast majority of us (a year of highschool Spanish doesn't count), we anglophiles have to go out of our way to get that second language. In most of North America one has to make time, seek out and (sometimes) pay for instruction and learning materials, and actively search for content to gain exposure to another language.

By definition der/die/das are telling us everything we need to know so the adjective can be lazy, or 'weak,' and just do its -e or -en thing. As a bonus this is the simplest table to memorize.\n\nWhen the gender and case aren't indicated then the adjective steps in. 'Ein' is a good example- \"ein <noun>\" could be nominative masculine or neuter, or accusative neuter. So the adjective picks up an 'r' ending for the masculine nominative, and an 's' ending for the neuter in both cases. We now have as much information as the definite article would give us. Same goes for the no-article scenario. zB: masculine and neuter dative adjectives get an -m ending because there is no 'dem' or 'einem'. Once again we have as much information as a 'dem' would give us.\n\nCompare this to \"eine (or keine) <noun>.\" 'Keine' tells us it's a female or plural noun in nom or acc. This is just as much information as we'd get with a 'die' in front of the noun so the adjective doesn't have to do anything and can stay in its standard form. Same for accusative masculine- 'einen' tells us as much about the gender and case of the noun as 'den' would, so the adjective doesn't need to change from its standard, definite article form, which happens to also have an -en ending.\n\nNote that with masculine and neuter the genitive adjectives don't need to change even if there's no article because the noun itself has an 's' ending.

This also keeps noteToPlay from being null which is generally good practice.\n\n* There's no need to make whichNote a member variable unless it's used elsewhere in the class.\n\nWhy do you have bools, a string, and an int indicating the note to play? That feels unnecessary and is potentially dangerous. What happens if I do something like this:\n\n    var card = new MainCard();\n    card.noteOne = true;\n    card.noteTwo = true;\n    card.noteToPlay = \"IV\";\n\nIf you really need a bool, a string, and an int to represent a note then you'll want to do something to couple those values together to prevent getting into a weird state. This means more code, but it's much less error prone. A Note class would be good for that:\n\n    public class Note\n    {\n        int id { get; private set; }\n        string label { get; private set; }\n        bool enabled { get; set; }\n    \n        public Note (int id, bool enabled = false)\n        { /* code to set the class properties goes here. I'd use the same array trick to set the label appropriately */ }\n    }\n\n* The private setters prevent outside code from changing those values like in my example above. \n\nIf you take that approach the above init function gets changed to something like this:\n\n    var notes = IEnumerable.Range(1,5).Select(index => new Note(index)).ToArray();\n    int whichNote = Random.Range(0,4);\n    noteToPlay = notes[whichNote].label\n\nThat first line is using LINQ (you asked for slick!). It'll take some time to get up to speed on LINQ but it's worth it. It's probably my favorite thing in C#. What it's doing is essentially the same as this:\n\n    Note[] notes = new Note[5];\n    for( int i = 0; i <= 4; i++)\n    { \n           notes[i] = new Note(i + 1);\n    }\n\nYou could also make noteToPlay is a Note instead of a string. You can make noteToPlay's setter private too if you don't want any code outside of MainCard to change what Note noteToPlay is set to.", "created_utc": "1476924163.0", "edited": "False", "id": "d8zlewx", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_58dkw0", "parent_id": "t3_58dkw0", "score": "6", "subreddit": "csharp", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhdf"}, {"author": "atom-b", "body": "One thing to consider is that WPF and UWP UIs have a lot in common (both use XAML, for example), and UWP is clearly the direction Microsoft will be pushing everyone.", "created_utc": "1457467284.0", "edited": "False", "id": "d0sfjs2", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_49k2ds", "parent_id": "t3_49k2ds", "score": "18", "subreddit": "dotnet", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3h"}, {"author": "atom-b", "body": "More or less painful than re-implementing everything on all your target platforms?", "created_utc": "1455822924.0", "edited": "False", "id": "d04uo9d", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_46gabc", "parent_id": "t1_d04uimb", "score": "3", "subreddit": "dotnet", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3h"}, {"author": "atom-b", "body": "Zombie Chow is great anti-aggro tech in the 1 mana slot which is something the classic set really lacks.
