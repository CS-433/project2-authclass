I'm originally from the Canary Islands, Spain but work took me to live in Berlin, Germany in 2018. I had a couple friends living in the city, but nobody to share my musical hobby. Towards the end of 2018 I wrote a guy on instagram, he was based in Berlin and shared my musical taste, so he recommended meeting in [Mion](https://mion-records.berlin/), the place that would become one of my favorite places on earth!\n\nSo basicly, Mion is a record store that imports records from Japan. At the beginning I was completely lost in the store, they had a huge selection but damn, I had never seen any of the sleeves on the store. Still, on my first visit, I went to the jazz section and managed to find 2 nice lps. The price range was somewhere between 1\u20ac to...maybe 20\u20ac? Basicly because they would sell records online and just sell whatever they discarded from the online sale on the shop.\n\nTo be honest, record digging stopped beeing a real thing for me a couple of years ago. I always had the feeling that I knew most of the stuff that is around on the shops and I never had the excitement of finding something fresh and cheap again. Until Mion! Damn I spent whole days browsing through thousands of lps, to select a couple dozens or even hundreds on some days and just spent the time checking them one by one until I had found something cool. Sure I did!\n\nAnyways, one day they closed the phisical store and it was a super sad day for me. Also, I remained jobless during corona in 2020, so, I applied to Mion! (It's been the most sincere application letter I've ever written). They hired me and I spent an awesome year working there, super fan job if you are a freak like I am.\n\nSo, nowadays I'm back in Spain and I still look for Japanese records online.
