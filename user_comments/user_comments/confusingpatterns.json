I managed okay partly because I don't drink much, so I only went out a couple times a term. But I also wanted to save up as much as possible so I could fund my MA and not have to work through it.\n\nMy top tips for being sensibly frugal on a student loan are:\n\n- don't shop for food anywhere except Aldi or Lidl if you can possibly help it. Including alcohol. If you're okay eating vegetarian a few days a week you can save a TON of money. Keep some junk food in your section of the freezer to help with the takeaway cravings.\n\n- if you want to go out, get drunk first on cheap alcohol and don't buy when you're out\n\n- if you're a coffee fiend, a drip coffee machine from Argos for \u00a320 and a cheap Wilko thermos will save your ass\n\n- don't buy books unless you absolutely need them. You can get by with the library copies pretty often\n\n- charity shops are your friend for so much more than clothes. You can find a lot of interesting stuff for Xmas/birthday presents. Even things like lamps, small appliances, small furniture items.\n\n- only sign up for societies you will actually go to. I'd recommend your academic one, 1 sports and 1 leisure/other. So for instance in my final year I was in French soc, climbing soc and Pok\u00e9mon soc. Sports socs have generally the highest entry fees so if you're not into that, feel free to skip! Running/walking is free :)\n\n- if you want a bike, get one cheap off FB marketplace or something. They get nicked and it'd be devastating to buy a good one just to lose it.\n\n- if you want to go to formal socials (e.g. black tie events) get a cheap outfit you can wear over and over. Pick 1 or 2 to go to, maybe 1 at Xmas and 1 end of year. \n\nKey thing to remember really is that most students are completely skint and winging it.

Shame on you.\"\n\nI replied:\n\n\"It's a bit sad that my opinion bothered you so much...\n\nMaybe you should try reading books (even other classics!) which don't include long tangents (themselves sometimes the length of a novel!) on subjects unrelated to the main plot. The \"greats\" don't always write books that are essentially exercises in self-infatuated grandiosity - but in this instance I think that is the case.\n\nThere is no shame in not liking an author or their style or one of their books, even if their works are part of the literary canon. Some people hate Shakespeare and Austen and Shelley, and even though I do like their works, other people have the right to their own opinions.\n\nPersonally, I hate Les Mis\u00e9rables but I like The Last Days of a Condemned Man. I hate The Outsider but I like The Plague and The Fall. I like Jean Racine's plays and appreciate his mastery of alexandrin poetry and the sonnets of Joachim du Bellay. It's not an issue of understanding at all, but one of literary taste.\n\nHowever, I think it is shameful to change the language of a conversation to exclude one of the participants. So, I'm going to translate everything we have said so that the English speakers, to whom my original comment was addressed, can understand.\"", "created_utc": "1652356932.0", "edited": "False", "id": "i8b2zn6", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_u45oti", "parent_id": "t1_i8ao9ik", "score": "1", "subreddit": "books", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh4i"}, {"author": "confusingpatterns", "body": "German word order is the exact issue...

I received a map of the capital Kyiv, marking the location I needed to go to. I went there. After me, representatives of leading world media outlets started arriving there as well. Heavily armed soldiers verified that we were among the invitees. We were put in black cars that took us to a complex of fancy buildings that used to serve as dwellings, not far from President Zelenskyy\u2019s office.\n\nAfter one of the most meticulous security checks I had ever gone through, in the course of which I was stripped of my phone, I was asked to walk exactly behind a soldier and security guard walking ahead of me, not straying even an inch. The explanation? To avoid the anti-personnel mines that had been placed in some of the rooms and corridors. The entire complex, it appeared, was the best-guarded compound in the world these days. All around were armored vehicles, anti-tank missile launchers, sand bags, firing positions, tractors (apparently for snow removal) and dozens of armed men.\n\nThe dominant color of the high-ceilinged room we entered was military green. The walls were adorned in the European tradition. The curtains were the color of a military uniform. The ceilings had colorful parrots as decoration. \u201cI know you\u2019ve already been told,\u201d the president\u2019s personal spokesman told the journalists, \u201cbut I want to again make sure that none of you have any broadcasting equipment, such as phones or live broadcasting equipment. Your personal safety depends on this.\u201d The president\u2019s security guards drew the curtains.\n\nAfter a short wait, the president entered the room and sat down, wearing olive, Palladium-like shoes, black cargo pants and an olive-colored sweatshirt. The president, claiming that the Russian army\u2019s losses were 10-fold higher than the Ukrainian army\u2019s losses, seemed relaxed during the almost one-hour session in which he answered questions. No one from his team interfered during this almost clandestine event, and no one inquired in advance about the questions we wanted to ask. Only when speaking about Ukrainian women and children who had been killed by the Russians did he seem emotional, with glittering eyes.\n\nZelenskyy first answered a question by Haaretz, relating to how he saw Kyiv\u2019s future. \u201cIf they annihilate all of us, they\u2019ll enter Kyiv,\u201d he said soberly. \u201cIf there are tens or hundreds of thousands of people, whom Russia is now mobilizing, and they all come with hundreds or thousands of tanks, they\u2019ll penetrate Kyiv. We understand this. If they carpet bomb and erase the historical memory of this whole region, erasing Russia\u2019s history, Europe\u2019s history, then they\u2019ll come to Kyiv. If that is their goal, let them enter. But then they\u2019ll have to live on this land alone. Certainly, without us, since they\u00a0won't find any friends here.\u201d\n\nRegarding\u00a0Israeli mediation\u00a0between Ukraine and Russia, Zelenskyy added that \u201camong the founding fathers of Israel, there were Ukrainian Jews who brought with them their history and a fierce desire to build a wonderful country, as it is now. So, it\u2019s not so bad to have such mediation.\"\n\n\"I talked to\u00a0Mister Bennett and told him that I don\u2019t think it would be right at this point to meet in Russia, Ukraine or Belarus. These aren\u2019t places in which we could reach any understandings on stopping the war. I\u2019m not talking about technical meetings, but about meetings between leaders. I believe Israel could serve as such a meeting place, especially in Jerusalem.\u201d\n\nAccording to Zelenskyy, \u201cin talking about security guarantees [for Ukraine] and the countries that should be involved in agreements about such guarantees, Israel should definitely be among them.\u201d\n\nUkraine\u2019s president noted that \u201cMany Jews emigrated to Israel from Ukraine, Russia, Belarus and Kazakhstan. There are large numbers of people who speak Ukrainian or Russian there, one and a half million, I believe. These are people with influence on decision makers and I assume that they definitely support us, even though some may support Russia too, since the media play an important role. In Israel, as in Germany and the United States, Russian media has a lot of impact. There are hardly any Ukrainian channels there. I think it\u2019s time to change that.\u201d\n\nAt the end of the meeting, when he was about to leave the room, a French journalist noted that he looked tired. The president, who even in the midst of a war has not forgotten his sense of humor, turned to the journalist and asked him: \u201cDo you know why I look a bit tired? Maybe it\u2019s because I am.\u201d", "created_utc": "1647114755.0", "edited": "False", "id": "i0ents9", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_tcoqao", "parent_id": "t1_i0elboa", "score": "4", "subreddit": "worldnews", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13"}, {"author": "confusingpatterns", "body": "They reportedly took back a (ruined) town directly north of Mariupol.
