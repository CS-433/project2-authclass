In the current system, you will NEVER get an AI Iroquois \n\nSo to make things more streamlined\n1. Cohesion should be increased by relative army strength (including tech and units fielded) \n2. Only federation leaders can make alliance outside the federation.

Federation leaders should have a CB against other federation leaders to steal their members (+ 5 year truce to give time to increase relationship\n5. To make diplomacy make sense, federation members automatically leave if they are negative relations. They can switch allegiance to another federation if the they have high relations with another federation leader (ie incentive for player to keep members happy). AND, same culture group adds +/-10 reasons to stay/leave. This is so a federation like the Iroquois is more inclined to stay together.\n6. AI federations should be hard coded to not adopt more than 5 tribal members at a time (ie Iroquois\u2026 who didn\u2019t take tuscarora until the 1700s).

And while this could make sense since you can start as them in 1444, and they're not a formable, this is nullified but the amazing French ideas, Castilian ideas, and Swedish ideas that are available also in 1444.  \n\\*\\*Aztec ideas for reference : +10 infantry combat and -10 idea cost ; -10 reduce war exhaustion cost ; +1 legitimacy ; +10 manpower recovery ; +10 morale of armies ; +10 national tax ; +10 production ; +20 spy network ; Ambition +25 national manpower.  \nTheir religion is good, and is even better in version 1.34 with the new fast-reform strategy. Their fully reformed bonuses are : -.05 monthly war exhaustion ; +1 diplo relation ; +5 discipline ; +1 colonist ; -20% stability.  \nAltogether, this makes Aztecs a mediocre nation WHEN CONSIDERING its starting position. Even if we were to consider multiplayer, Aztecs will get bodied by any colonizer alliance (i.e. England/Portugal/Spain) that knows how to win a naval war. So, giving them better ideas isn't going to break the meta. So then we get single player. Single player should be fun and rewarding. Giving Aztecs good bonuses to fight colonizers does NOT break that principle. Furthermore, giving Aztecs good bonuses when locked behind feudalism and later ideas doesn't give AI Aztecs any advantages, since AI will never be able to reform their religion because OG reform mechanics are hard even for players to manage. Conclusion, buffing Aztecs can only benefit the dismal state of the new world.  \nWhy is the new world in such a bad state? Well, I'm certainly not the first one who absolutely despises the continent spanning federation alliances in North America. But beyond that, even the mechanics for Aztecs are frustrating. First of all, to get a CB on anyone in the old world, you need to start in Africa (by colonization through exploration ideas) or you need No-CB. This is frustrating since if your capital is in the New World AND you have Native tech (Mesoamerican for instance), you should absolutely be able to use Exploration's idea finisher to fabricate on any coastal province in the Old World. And then after that, you can't trade company any new world land, very much so limiting your income as a new world nation. This also makes no sense, since it implicitly nerfs all natives.  \nAs a principal, I enjoy alternate history. And I would enjoy to play a nice reverse colonizer game with a strong Native nation to pummel the colonizers back to the Dark Ages. What this could look like:  \n1. Add some mission tree :  \n 1. give claims and missionary strength on Mayan land once you consolidate Nahuatl mexico.  \n 2. give temporary bonuses related to each reform you pass. And then a finisher mission that gives you -10 tech cost for 50 years  \n 3. give global settler increase modifiers for colonizing Mexico and California  \n 4. give permaclaims on capital states of known colonizers  \n 5. give a conquistador and explorer so you don't have to take exploration immediately  \n 6. give a mission to discover the Incan minors and give permaclaims (with a goodie branching mission to befriend and ally the Incan empire if it forms, which it won't)  \n2. Buff ideas to make it more fun (combining from CKII ideas)  \n 1. +5 discipline and -15 idea cost ; -5 tech cost ; -2 unrest ; can recruit explorers -10 naval attrition ; +10 morale of armies ; +1 missionary ; +25 national manpower ; +10 land fire damage ; Ambition -.10 inflation.  \n 2. -.05 monthly war exhaustion ; +1 diplo REP (diplo relations are useless in the new world with no vassals) ; +5 discipline ; +1 colonist ; -20% AE modifier (inspired by modify from high doom).", "created_utc": "1651871917.0", "edited": "False", "id": "i7lp68f", "is_submitter": "True", "link_id": "t3_ujxli7", "parent_id": "t3_ujxli7", "score": "1", "subreddit": "eu4", "subreddit_id": "t5_2uqat"}, {"author": "maxseptillion77", "body": "Please, debase currency is not a free money button.

English is Germanic because it descends from Old English, not because it has Germanic words. The converse is that English is not a Romance language because it does not descend from Latin, regardless of however many Latin words are in English.\n* That being said, languages tend to keep a core vocabulary (see, Swadesh List)\n* Historical linguistics attempts to connect languages genetically by tracking change in phonetics (sounds) between shared cognates. Note that a cognate does not need to mean the same thing, it just needs to come from the same root word, which is not the same as a loan word. English has the word \u201chuman\u201d which is NOT a cognate of \u201cman\u201d, it is a loan from Old French \u201chumain\u201d. \u201cMan\u201d derives from \u201cMann\u201d which means \u201cperson\u201d, and replaced Old English \u201cwer\u201d (whence \u201cwerewolf\u201d), which IS a cognate of Latin \u201cvir\u201d which does mean \u201cman\u201d. \n* So for Armenian. Armenian has a base vocabulary that is Indo-European. We can demonstrate as such by phonetic comparison. \u201cMayr\u201d in Armenian corresponds to \u201cmater\u201d in Latin \u201cm\u00e2dar\u201d in Persian \u201c\u043c\u0430\u0442\u044c\u201d in Russian and so on. It DOES have a \u201csubstratum\u201d of Urartan vocabulary, which is part of its history. This vocabulary is not significant enough in frequency or proportion of core vocabulary to constitute Armenian being part of another family. \n* A note on phonetic analysis. Just because words look similar does not make them SYSTEMICALLY related. \u201cMayr\u201d relates to \u201cm\u00e2dar\u201d and \u201c\u043c\u0430\u0442\u044c\u201d in a systemic way that is the same or similar with most other words that follow the same phonetic pattern. Hence \u201cHayr\u201d looking like \u201cpedar\u201d and \u201cpater\u201d in Latin.  This is important because the \u201cAltaic\u201d language family attempts to link Turkic languages with Mongolian, Japanese, and Korean using vocabulary too. However, it does not use a statistically significant amount of cognates from core vocabulary. It also doesn\u2019t demonstrate systemic sound change over time. And it can easily be explained away by the influence of Middle Mongolian during the Mongol Empire. In the case of Armenian however, it does follow the aforementioned processes in academic practice. \n* To point out a fun factoid about systemic sound change, Indo-European *dW- changes to Armenian *erK-, hence you have cognates like Latin \u201cduo\u201d and English \u201ctwo\u201d but Armenian \u201cyerku\u201d. This is systemic and present in core vocabulary. \n\nBut Armenian is definitely Indo-European at its core. The only point of contention is where exactly Armenian fits in with the rest of Indo-European branch-wise, because Armenian grammar is atypical for Indo-European and the chronology of sound changes also isn\u2019t clear. So linguistics just put it in its own branch for now.", "created_utc": "1649195765.0", "edited": "False", "id": "i3jpncg", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_tx2s2x", "parent_id": "t3_tx2s2x", "score": "16", "subreddit": "armenia", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qo29"}, {"author": "maxseptillion77", "body": "But why didn\u2019t you take the Hont gold mine?", "created_utc": "1648470195.0", "edited": "False", "id": "i2fgyf3", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_tq5dcn", "parent_id": "t1_i2f9sit", "score": "6", "subreddit": "eu4", "subreddit_id": "t5_2uqat"}, {"author": "maxseptillion77", "body": "Yknow what I respect the use of console commands to help learn the game. \n\nGood luck with your campaign\u2026 well after you restart haha", "created_utc": "1647884837.0", "edited": "False", "id": "i1k1vwj", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_tjg63e", "parent_id": "t3_tjg63e", "score": "209", "subreddit": "eu4", "subreddit_id": "t5_2uqat"}, {"author": "maxseptillion77", "body": "I like to think abt it like this, this dev is usually their entire country\u2019s dev.

Trade company for merchants. \n- Delete unnecessary forts\n- Steer as much trade into your own node as possible \n\nAdvanced tips:\n\nLoan size is a function of total development. The amount of money is not affected by autonomy - which means newly conquered land immediately allows you to take bigger loans.\n\nHOWEVER, the amount of loans you can take is a function of your monthly income. Your monthly income IS affected by local autonomy among other factors. \n\nWhat this means is that you can have cycles of deficit spending.\n\nWhen you start as Castile, you have about 300 development with relatively high autonomy. This means you can take pretty good loans, but only about 20 or so. Furthermore, your only paths of expansion are worthless Sunni lands down south, Aragon that you get for free with Iberian wedding anyways, or the AE hell that is France. Basically, take a couple burgher loans, but you don\u2019t really need to go crazy. It\u2019s ok to be in the red for the first 50 years of the game.\n\nYour best strategy as Castile is this :\n- Restart until you can ally Aragon \n- DO NOT ally Portugal\n- Disinherit your heir ASAP and put Enrique on an army so he can just die\n- Decrease local autonomy everywhere\n- Fabricate and eat Navarre ASAP (not worth the diplo slot)\n- When Burghers are loyal, turn on dev edict and start devving La Mancha gold mine to at least 8-10 development. \n- Eat Grenada when you\u2019re ready. Conserve manpower with free company. Max money from their allies and prestige, no provinces yet. \n-  Once you get mission for Portugal PU, DOW with Aragon if and only if they\u2019ve taken Exploration (subjects will never take colonizing ideas)\n- Take Labour and Gascony from England if you can to release Gascony\n- Take Ceuta from Portugal, and PU them\n\nYou should go exploration first of course, but your next idea should be religious. Colonization is weak sauce compared to just conquest. Religious is great for you for infinite Pope points + colonization CB for free. \n\nListen, by this point, you should be filthy rich. Get even richer by just playing colonization game in 1500s : form with max 5 provinces a colonial nation everywhere you have range (subsidize subjects to colonize and just conquer other nations\u2019 colonies later).  Eat up Mexico and Peru ASAP for new world gold and their treasure ships will give you about 500-600 ducats a year. \n\nMonopolize Ivory Coast and the Cape for trade steering. Colonize over to Zanzibar, and eat them using your religious ideas. Use East Africa as a base of operations into Coromandel with tech difference (ignore West Africa interior, Kongo, and Aden for now, it\u2019s just not worth the admin). Afterwards naturally go into Spice Islands (or just skip Coromandel). Once you eat Malacca and the Maluccas, you\u2019ll never need ducats again. \n\nBy that point, you should have also moved into Italy (which you should also make full states for your incoming manpower issues\u2026 you\u2019ll like to take quantity third probably).

The series premier was actually really well made in terms of **characters**, especially Frenchie and Hughie. But now, all character motivation has kind of left and there aren't any stakes except the made-up ones they pull out of their ass every episode.   \nFrenchie is supposed to be a world infamous arms dealer. You're telling me he just has all the time in the world to just hang out and risk his entire business on... these three jokers he doesn't even like? With all his connections, he can't figure out housing?  \nI still don't know what MM's backstory is, why we care, and why he cares so much to still participate in this lost cause.   \nHughie is supposed to be really good at technology. But he just mopes around all episode and provides literally the least value to the entire team outside of his crush on Annie, which they keep milking from S1.   \nThat's not even to speak about Butcher who isn't even likable anymore. I mean, the swearing was somewhat charming when he was literally right. But he is literally a liar, a gaslighter, he's selfish, he's inconsiderate, he's not even principled, he refuses to listen to his wife. And he's NOT EVEN GOOD \u2013 he's literally incompetent outside of plot armor.   \nThe main villain is now... a Nazi because Homelander wasn't good enough? Guess they couldn't make Homelander a Nazi or that'd hurt ratings ig, even if it'd make much more sense.   \nBut the worst has got to be the **writing**. Like I said, no stakes. Let's just talk about the episode with Kimiko's brother. See, Kimiko has been mute since S1 and clearly is profoundly traumatized. She is building a relationship with Frenchie and has interesting powers that rival Black Noir. She also naturally conflicts with Butcher as a super. This is an interesting recipe. But, they drop this entire plot line after this episode. Instead of having a very interesting emotional breakthrough where we begin to understand her feelings as : a slave, likely a survivor of sexual abuse, an unwilling immigrant in a country where she can barely speak the language, in the context of her radicalized brother. It could have been a sad but touching instance of a lost cause \u2013 her brother isn't her brother anymore, and she must pick her new family, something that would foreshadower Ryan and Butcher's relationship and help Butcher to recognize that Supers are just people with powers. This ideology is the polar opposite mind you of Homelander's (and Stormfront's I suppose) that supers are superior to other people. \n\nBUT WE DON\"T GET ANY OF THAT AT ALL. And instead we get literally nothing. Some moping I suppose, but they introduce this character FOR NO REASON and then IMMEDIATELY KILL HIM OFF. Like wtf. Not to say the waste of plot power by ignoring how smuggling got him into the country in the first place, which should reinforce the globalization of superpowers point that the superterrorist plot line did (if you want to shoehorn in some commentary on Iraq ig). Ugh, we do get that bizarre love plot line with Frenchie and Kimiko. But... Frenchie from the start saw Kimiko in himself as a sisterly figure, someone who understood his childhood too. That would be much more appropriate since Frenchie is well known to be a whore and a dangerous arms dealer \u2013 he doesn't want a wife. But family? Found family at that! That's some good writing... which would, again, emphasize the motif of \"choice\" in the show. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSmh, trash TV now.

All of India is already colonized by Indian nations at game start. (As in, the province has a core of a tag, a tag is the country, so like France is a tag with a core on Paris, Normandy is a tag with a core on Caux).\n\n\nTrade company regions can\u2019t form CNs, you\u2019ll use those provinces (you get a territorial core) for trade companies. Trade company regions are any region outside of your subcontinent (check in game map for subcontinent). For example, Vienna is in the Western Europe subcontinent. But Pest is not. You can trade company Pest. Paris is in the Western Europe subregion, you can add it to your trade company.\n\nLikewise, new world is also an in game category, where you can only get colonial nations and no trade companies. However, not all new world provinces are in a colonial region. Bermuda is new world (no trade company) but not in the Caribbean colonial region. You\u2019ll keep it, it won\u2019t join your caraibas CN. \n\nAs for which type of colonial nation, it depends. 9/10 you want self sufficient nation for the extra colonist. So that\u2019s Brazil, America, California, La Plata, Cascadia, Louisiana, Canada, and Colombia.\n\nIn the case of the Caribbean, I think private enterprise is good for the goods produced (all 10 dev sugar provinces and such), and they get an extra merchant will pulls more trade power into the Caribbean node just for you to take. \n\nIn the case of Peru and Mexico, go crown colony. You don\u2019t need to colonize these provinces, just conquer them. And crown colonies have a subject interaction for more gold income. Use these CNs for gold and FL, not trade per se. \n\nAnother pro tip: one you conquer or colonize 5 provinces in Mexico/Peru, you will form a CN. Upon formation, the CN will receive full cores on all provinces you have cored and are in the process of coring, and will refund the admin to you of the province not yet cored. Use this to your advantage. Conquer the entirety of the region as fast as possible, and spend 3 years at wayyy overextension. Time it so that the fifth province will core at the time that you will have had the rest of the region coring, the CN will receive full cores and you\u2019ll get the admin back.", "created_utc": "1642166630.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hsmikk0", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_s3b7ga", "parent_id": "t1_hslb2li", "score": "1", "subreddit": "eu4", "subreddit_id": "t5_2uqat"}, {"author": "maxseptillion77", "body": "Thankfully Paris is worth a mass", "created_utc": "1642136658.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hsl9l9x", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_s3c93c", "parent_id": "t1_hskpco9", "score": "33", "subreddit": "eu4", "subreddit_id": "t5_2uqat"}, {"author": "maxseptillion77", "body": "Pro tip : you only need 5 provinces in a colonial region to get a colony, use this to your advantage. Colonize quick for treaty de tordesillas (no Catholics will break it), and get a colonial nation, then subsidize them for 2-4 ducats a month so they colonize for you (consider it two free colonists). \n\nHowever, I don\u2019t recommend forming colonial nations (except caraibas) until tech 7, where the colonial nation will have full expansion ideas unlocked. In the mean time, full colonize Ivory Coast for massive trade income (and future trade steering). Yes you should dominate Ivory Coast and Zanzibar. You should ideally be imperializing India before 1550 so that they don\u2019t catch up in tech, which they tend to do in recent patches bc of dev pushing institutions in their cotton farmlands provinces. \n\nSo the strat is : you have one colonist around tech 5, use that one to colonize Caribbean and Ivory Coast (have two colonies with your one colonist, that\u2019s 4 ducats a month. Just go for uprising policy, it\u2019s not worth baby sitting at this point). As Portugal, don\u2019t bother colonizing every provinces in the region yet (only trade centers ideally, but also farthest colony you can put). You\u2019ll want colonial range to island hop. You also get Goa for free from (event? Mission?) as well as Macau for free. \n\n\n\nBy tech 7 and expansion ideas, start forming more colonial nations. Take assimilation policy ASAP for the goods produced and explo-expan policy. Once you get your three colonists, only keep four active colonies. \n\nUse colonists 1 and 2 to colonize new world, and colonist 3 + no colonist extra colony for trade company lands and further island hopping (lowest value to you). Also take Parliament when you can for a fourth colonist (absolutism is juicy absolutely\u2026 but you\u2019re Portugal. Just have fun takin it relatively slow and colonize the world). \n\nSo.. yeah, hope this pro tip helps :)", "created_utc": "1642136471.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hsl987b", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_s3b7ga", "parent_id": "t3_s3b7ga", "score": "1", "subreddit": "eu4", "subreddit_id": "t5_2uqat"}, {"author": "maxseptillion77", "body": "I\u2019m pretty sure the printing press can spawn in any Protestant province in Europe.

They should have like Siberian Frontiers or just cheaper in your same-culture provinces. And colonizing elsewhere should be cheaper and faster than from England (after all, isn\u2019t it faster to move people from New York to Syracuse than London to Syracuse?).\n\nNew world trade sucks and unfairly benefits colonizers. Why does 1444 trade routes? And speaking of trade, New World nations can\u2019t trade company any new world land, and they can\u2019t form colonial nations in Australia (which is super annoying as Aztec). \n\nGetting maps also sucks, I\u2019m surprised that reforming your government/religion doesn\u2019t give you full maps of whatever colonizer you reform off of, considering it gives you nearly full tech and all institutions. \n\nNew World National ideas are pretty lame. Colonizer nations have awesome ideas overall (US, Texas, even Vermont), but just take a gander at Arawak ideas, ugh. At least have some love for formables, like Inca, Maya, Aztec, Iroquois (other federations). They could probably do this : NA-tribes can form federations for good ideas based on region, Mesoamericans have their regional formable (Aztec, Maya, Inca), and SA-tribes can have a regional formable (Amazoas, Chile, La Plata, Brazil\u2026 so like if the Mapuche owned the whole coast of Chile they can form \u201cMapuche Chile\u201d, or Arawak owning Amazoa can form \u201cArawak Amazoa\u201d, a so on). Also give Puerto Rico and at least two more islands to a native tribe. Every culture should have a primary nation. \n\nAnd one last thing, releasable vassals. Eating new world territory is annoying as a new world tribe because it\u2019s a lot of Heathen, wrong culture land to take and core. I\u2019m annoyed you can\u2019t take and release any vassals worth releasing. So like I\u2019m thinking a client state system to vassal feed, available to New World tech groups by tech 10 (1500). These new world client nations can only be formed in colonial cores (sorry Mexico/Inca), and the client doesn\u2019t have the same religion as it\u2019s former, but does have a -15 LD modifier if the new world nation is rivaled to the province\u2019s previous owner (thinking : rebellious settlers want new management), and don\u2019t pay a vassal fee, but do join in wars. Must wait 20 years to integrate. \n\nAnd one more thing : mesoamerican religion. If you\u2019ve reformed your religion as Nahuatl or Maya, and vassal you\u2019ve force converted should also have all the reforms. Because, for instance, in one Maya game I vassalises a Catholic Grenada exiled to Ivory Coast, but once I converted them\u2026 they became primitives and couldn\u2019t build boats. It was 1600. Wtf game. Same with client nations, who automatically take Mayan religion, but then are formed as primitives. It\u2019s dumb. Plus, have your Mayan clients have a free colonist should be a benefit of starting as a New World nation because it\u2019s a hard start.\n\nMy point for these changes is making the game more fun.

And you start with only like 10k manpower (for this, just hire free company and ignore money with burgher loans, you\u2019ll be fine, but living with negative income is like an intermediate thing).\n\nIdeas. You need administrative points to annexing Novgorod asap for your missions. You also need to get bigger to control your vassals (highly recommend the new estate privilege that removes the -3 diplo rep penalty after annexation in exchange for +15 liberty desire\u2026 so you need to get your individual strength very much so up). So saying that you really need admin points for land and tech. But what you don\u2019t have in money. I highly recommend starting off trade : 3 merchants for Kiev, Crimea, Astrakhan, Persia, Samarkand, and Siberia nodes. Plus global trade power, and a +10 goods produced policy with religious (trade policies are awesome). Then I highly recommend taking either quality OR offensive, depending on your preference, although offensive is slightly better for Russia. You don\u2019t need quantity because base Russia with full patriarch authority already gets ~70% National manpower (ideas + tsardom + permanent serfdom event in 1500s). \n\nYour third idea is your administrative group (since forming Russia is your priority). This is where you take religious. See, cause your missions give you missionary strength over Kazan, the Volga, and the Crimea. If you full core + patriarch authority + edict + advisor, that\u2019s already like 5 missionary strength, not including policies (you should accept Kazani/Bashkir (gold mine) and Crimean/Mishar culture, it\u2019s good dev in those regions, but it\u2019s an either/or type deal). Religious as a third will give you good policies with trade and offensive. Religious will give you a solid CB into Persia, Uzbek/Samarkand/Transoxiana whatever, and once you reach Siberia/Manchu minors, the CB will be amazing, and the missionary strength much welcome for those Tengri and confusion provinces (I like to convert before adding to TC at least before age of absolutism, for the RP). \n\nThat is my Russia strategy.

The solution I found is : make your language learning strategy habit oriented. \n\nThree elements 1) interest and 2) length and 3) difficulty level.\n\nDo you have a niche interest that has content that you like to read about? For example, I read the armenian news and I study Russian. That means I can get a lot of content on Instagram, podcasts, music, and so on, and it all is something I\u2019m interested in. Never try and read something that is a literal slog to get through, and you can feel the difference between \u201cchallenging\u201d and \u201cboring\u201d. For instance : I like reading art/cultural/blog type posts/articles, but I don\u2019t particularly care to read about Russian politicians. So\u2026 I just skip the boring parts, and go right to the meaty stuff. Basically, if you want to maintain a language habit, it\u2019s a very good idea to consume media about topics you\u2019re interested in talking about. (It may even be worth to ask your friends \u201cwhat do I go on rants about?\u201d)\n\nLength and difficulty are not the same. Say you like to read. If you read the monologue of Hamlet in English, that would be a lot harder although shorter than reading a chapter of Harry Potter. \nI for one try not to spend too much time reading longform articles or listening to podcasts longer than 15 minutes. The idea is this : you spend less time on one piece of media, so you can move to the next one, and keep myself interested, find different topical words, interact with different author\u2019s styles. Shorter content also means the author gets to the point quicker, which helps you understand how people write in that foreign language. \n\nWhich brings me to difficulty. You should not read the classics. You should not read full length books. You should not listen to hour-long, full analysis podcasts. You shouldn\u2019t, ONLY because you are trying to build a habit. It is better to go with fresh eyes to a short article, finish it, take away 2-6 new and salient vocab words and learn them well, then be stuck with the same list of useless literary words and random descriptive verbs than don\u2019t come together in any useful thematic sense***. Your life is busy, and you want to build a habit. I know that I personally can\u2019t commit to reading 10 pages a day of a book, even in English. That\u2019s why I make the effort to just integrate Russian into Instagram or Spotify, or things I use conveniently on a daily basis. You know yourself- what are you likely to do out of habit? Ok, so integrate your language learning into it, and don\u2019t let yourself forget about it. \n\n\n***a note on vocabulary. I don\u2019t think you need to learn every new vocab word you find, and specifically you shouldn\u2019t. Instead try to focus only on those words that you will end up using to talk about your life, your background, your friends, and those niche topics you love so much. Then, you want to know where you got that vocabulary word from, and with what topic you use it. If you learn the word \u201claw\u201d in English, there\u2019s a big difference if you are a political science reader versus a science reader; AND if you\u2019re a political science reader, you don\u2019t need to know the science meaning yet, and vice versa- that will come over time as you progress. Vocabulary is better in context, so it\u2019s better to acquire a bunch of very topical words before diving into highly descriptive, flowery words, in my experience, because they are easier to remember. And let me just explain what \u201cthematic sense\u201d means - if you read Harry Potter, you will get words like \u201cgrasp\u201d, \u201cwand\u201d, \u201cgoblet\u201d, \u201cflabbergast\u201d, \u201ccubbard\u201d\u2026 these words don\u2019t form a nice logical pairing without the context of Harry Potter. As in, unless you\u2019re talking about Harry Potter specifically, these words will be hard to use. Whereas, if you want to talk about your niche interest that you think about constantly, then you\u2019ll want to know those words.", "created_utc": "1633797622.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hfzy2ba", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_q4j8b3", "parent_id": "t3_q4j8b3", "score": "8", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "maxseptillion77", "body": "No, they\u2019re permanent", "created_utc": "1633795147.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hfzsi9g", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_q3t18r", "parent_id": "t1_hfxqogw", "score": "1", "subreddit": "eu4", "subreddit_id": "t5_2uqat"}, {"author": "maxseptillion77", "body": "I mean...

I support having a national standard languages (in the case of Turkey, Turkish) for public discourse. But, like I said with Breton, I support having national supports of minority communities within reason. Armenians frequently set up Armenian schools in the Ottoman empire, to teach culture, language, &c. Diasporan Armenians with enough population do the same in California and in New York. \n\nWith the Navajo, for instance, they were sent to boarding schools to be evangelized and  \"assimilated\" by the state. This is cultural colonialism. Armenians, although on their own in Turkey (ie the Millet system), have set up schools in America and France with certain state scholarships and grants. This is a minority group taking an interest in itself. \n\nHence the within reason portion, if a minority group expresses enough interest in teaching its own language within a given municipality, then that municipality should be eligible for a grant to set up schools.

The second source I used is \"Global problems and the culture of capitalism\" by Richard Robbins (specifically chapter four, the section titled \"Language, Bureaucracy, and Education\"), and his point was that the French \"colonized\" their country and formed a nation-state through administrative integration (national media, military training, national education system). \n\nI'm a college student and the first source I was given in my French Revolution class, where we learned about the retroactive reclaiming of mediaeval works for the point of \"patriotism\" which was going on even before the Revolution. The second was a class on globalization through an anti-colonial lens. \n\nThat you mention it, I take back what I said about the 100 years' war because I don't have a source, and a romantic reappropriation by later historians sounds very likely to me (I'd like your source for that too).
