It feels like we get this exact question several times a week.\n\nBasically, speak to your child in one language, have your spouse speak to the child in another. You two *only* use your respective languages, and try not to let baby see or hear you using any others. That way, they'll learn to associate language A with one parent, and language B with the other. Language C will come from the environment (school, friends, etc). In the beginning, the child may mix up the languages, but it'll sort itself out shortly. Some people also say that their bilingual children take a little longer to learn to speak compared to monolingual children, but that doesn't imply anything is wrong with your child. The child may also go through a phase where they only want to speak the dominant language of the country you're living in; don't give in if that happens. Just refuse to answer them until they speak their other languages. Letting them get away with only speaking to you in the dominant language can lead to passive bilingualism, where they can understand a language, but not speak it.\n\nEdit: It looks like you're a single parent?
