The medication in question here is used to PREVENT someone from getting HIV in the first place, not to treat it. \n\n2. In the US, with some exceptions, most health insurance is private. In most cases employers will pick plan options from an insurance company to offer their employees, and this is how employees get their healthcare coverage. Before the ACA (\u201cObamacare\u201d) was passed, employers and insurance companies could pick and choose what preventive care would be covered. The law then mandated that certain types of preventive care be covered, like cancer screenings etc. If allowed to stand, this ruling would allow employers/insurance companies to go back to that \u201cpick and choose\u201d framework. It\u2019s crucial to note that insurance is considered part of employees\u2019 compensation package, so this ruling (and \u201cHobby Lobby\u201d before it, regarding contraception) essentially allows employers to exercise control over what their employees spend their remuneration on, according to their personal religious beliefs and preferences. Imagine if a Muslim boss forbade his workers from using their paychecks to buy alcohol because drinking is considered sinful in Islam and he didn\u2019t like it, and then the law backed him up. Pretty much the same concept here. \n\n3. I would dispute your characterization of contracting HIV as a \u201cmisdeed.\u201d Sometimes people get it even while taking precautions - their condom could break, their long term partner or spouse could be cheating, etc. HIV treatment is very expensive (much more so than the preventive medications, by the way). So if it\u2019s not covered as part of your health insurance, your options are to bankrupt yourself paying out of pocket or just let it progress into AIDS.

New York's never been the cheapest place in the world but rents went up so dramatically over that period that a lot of people & small businesses got displaced. That's definitely had a big impact on the cultural landscape,  for the worse.\n\nBut I also think people tend to exaggerate about the degree to which the city is a \"corporate wasteland\" entirely devoid of culture. There are still so many interesting things going on all over; compared to any other place I've lived there's no match, and I've been all over the US and Europe.\n\nAlso a certain degree of romanticizing the 70s/80s from people who didn't actually live through it. Was the city more accessible for artists/writers etc back then? Absolutely. Were there awesome artistic movements/literary scenes that have died out because of gentrification? 100%. But also some things are better now than they were back then. For example, my dad and his entire extended family lived in a shitty slumlord apartment in Hamilton Heights when they first came to the US from Latin America in the 1960s, lived there until the mid 70s before moving to Queens. There was plenty of violence, his dad (my grandfather) got assaulted and robbed multiple times in their own building.\n\nStuff like that still happens obviously but on the whole things are way safer today. Whereas the city let gay men die of AIDS in droves in the 80s, it's now offering them Monkeypox vaccines early on in the outbreak (not comparable situations and the rollout's a shitshow but still, as a gay guy I appreciate it). Tons of new immigrant communities are forming all over and contributing to the city's culture.\n\nSo TL;DR yes corporate encroachment and unsustainably high rents have taken a toll on the cultural life of the city over the years, but not everything is dead.

Also in Chicago the \u201cSides\u201d aren\u2019t totally analogous to the Boroughs. In Chi they\u2019re informal designations and have strong racial/class connotations; in New York they\u2019re actual administrative divisions that grew out of historical colonial settlements. They\u2019re almost like individual cities in their own right. \n- Depending on where you are in NYC there is less of a community feel. In much of Manhattan there are simply so many people packed into one place that it\u2019s impossible to know more than a few of your neighbors. But parts of Brooklyn and Queens seem to have more of a Chicago-style community feel. Relatedly there seems to be less of a collective city identity here, and by that I mean Chicago puts a lot more emphasis on certain historical events (the Fire, the 1893 World\u2019s Fair, etc) and on hometown celebrities (like Chance the Rapper and Oprah) than NYC does. There\u2019s some of that here too ofc but it\u2019s not quite the same. \n- NYC is wayyyy denser than Chicago. Manhattan is like if the Loop and River North extended for over 200 blocks. In my mind there\u2019s no real Chicago equivalent to somewhere like the Upper West Side (ie has the height and density of Downtown but is more of a residential area). Even Brooklyn feels a lot more \u201cintense\u201d than Chicago neighborhoods outside of downtown. \n- NY feels a lot safer to me than Chicago. Better foot traffic late at night and lower levels of gun violence make a huge difference. \n- NYC is more diverse. There are people from just about any country you can think of. Restaurants offer more specific ethnic cuisines - it\u2019s easier to get say regional Chinese foods outside of Chinatown or Flushing than it is outside of Chicago Chinatown. NY feels more global, whereas Chicago feels more \u201cAmerican,\u201d if that makes sense. A lot (but not all) of Chicago\u2019s historical immigrant communities have faded but NY has many more recently arrived people. There is of course racial segregation here, but in my experience it\u2019s not quite as extreme for the most part, and there\u2018s more of a tendency towards ethnic enclaves (eg you have Puerto Rican and Dominican and Central American and Colombian neighborhoods rather than one general \u201cHispanic\u201d area). \n- There\u2019s more of a \u201clive and let live\u201d mindset here. Less small talk, people generally leave each other alone, which some might interpret as rudeness. But I think New Yorkers are easier to get to know in casual settings; I\u2019ve had more chance conversations with people here and I\u2019m not a particularly extroverted person. \n- NYC is a lot more expensive. A lot more ultra wealthy people in certain parts.\n- I also feel like there are more unwritten \u201crules\u201d here than in Chicago. A lot more emphasis on things walking on the right side of the pavement/standing on the right side of the escalator, not abruptly stopping, taking your backpack off your back in a crowded subway, not holding up a line. Not that there isn\u2019t common courtesy in Chicago but there are so many more people here that there\u2019s a higher premium on following conventions that let things run smoothly.", "created_utc": "1654575512.0", "edited": "1654576300.0", "id": "ibg9s0p", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_v39fd4", "parent_id": "t3_v39fd4", "score": "1", "subreddit": "AskNYC", "subreddit_id": "t5_2uqch"}, {"author": "NegativeSheepherder", "body": "I\u2019m also 24 and have also had challenges with self-acceptance.

Is it the most exciting place in the city? Not really. But it\u2019s relatively quiet, has nice architecture, some good restaurants, a couple of decent bars, and lots of green space. I live in a studio in a big prewar building. Got a pandemic deal last year ($2000/month with 2 months free) and decided to renew. Rent went up a bit but not unreasonably so; it was by far the cheapest option for staying in a relatively centrally located part of Manhattan or Brooklyn. My unit has its issues - tap water started tasting weird, no counter space, need to run faucet to get hot water in the shower - but it\u2019s really big for the price, has 2 huge closets, newish appliances, and (knock on wood) pest free. The building is alright, the elevator goes through periods where it breaks down every other day, but then has several month stretches without issues. \n\nI don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessary to avoid the subways. Yes, they\u2019ve gotten a lot of bad press lately and there have been some genuinely concerning incidents, but overall they\u2019re still fine. People are understandably shaken by those freak incidents, as I am, but in the year I\u2019ve been riding regularly I have not had any concerning interactions. You\u2019ll most likely need them to get places and for all their delays they\u2019re still the most convenient way to travel across the city. The Columbia area is very well connected transit-wise. Along Broadway you have the 1 at 110th, 116th, and 125th, and the 1 + the express trains 2/3 at 96th. There are also B and C stations along Central Park West at those  same streets. You have easy access to the whole west side of Manhattan, which includes Lincoln Center and nightlife areas like Hell\u2019s Kitchen, Chelsea, and the West Village as well as the theater district. Brooklyn is easy too on the 2/3, albeit a bit longer (usually about 40 minutes). So is the Bronx.\n\nI personally feel very safe here. I\u2019ve come back late at night on occasion and there is still decent foot traffic on Broadway. The 1 is still pretty full around 11/midnight. Most of the Columbia crime alerts I got when I was a master\u2019s student last year were for stolen packages in building lobbies. Like anywhere else in the city more serious crimes occasionally happen, but they\u2019re rare up here. Usually someone demands a wallet and runs off. There was one sad incident last year where a guy got stabbed and killed near Morningside Park late at night but that was extremely out of the ordinary. Anytime very serious stuff like that happens it\u2019s big news. In general I would avoid any NYC park late at night unless there\u2019s some kind of event going on - not necessarily because they turn into dangerous hellholes or anything but because the darkness and lack of people make you more vulnerable. Riverside Park and Central Park\u2019s northern part are lovely from morning to evening, but they are very hilly with lots of blind spots at night. Same goes for Morningside Park, which I do not visit as often but at night also has the bad combo of steep steps and low visibility. It\u2019s harder to exit if something happens. But I should stress crime is not something I personally worry about too much here. If you exercise basic NYC precautions you will most likely be fine. \n\nGood luck in your apartment search and hope your wife enjoys Columbia!

The city being so enormous is both a blessing and a curse - so many people that you can probably find whatever kind of social circle you\u2019re looking for, but it also takes some digging to get there. \n\nI\u2019d second the recommendation to pursue your interests/hobbies, not necessarily with the intent of finding a partner. It\u2019s great for your mental health and chances are there will also be some queer people involved. Even if there aren\u2019t any in that particular group, making friends through that shared interest could introduce you to their gay friends or acquaintances. \n\nBut there are also lgbtq-specific activity groups you could look into. These are probably your best bet.

Having 8 million people packed into one place increases your likelihood of running into some bad apples, but even then the likelihood is still low here in NYC, especially for really serious crimes like that horrible subway shooting on Sunday.

But apart from that, every one of my friends and every member of my family has been nothing but supportive. \n\nThere\u2019s also a fear that even though your liberal friends know that open homophobia is socially unacceptable, they\u2019ll be subtly uncomfortable and awkward around you. You worry people\u2019s perception of you will change dramatically, and you worry that they\u2019ll think not coming out meant that you didn\u2019t trust them. (Thankfully none of that happened to me, but I worried for sure). And then you also have to factor in internalized homophobia. You might rationally know that there\u2019s nothing wrong with you, but you still feel \u201cwrong\u201d being yourself.

Housing: Some people do student housing in off-campus apartment buildings; not sure how hard it is to get a spot but I've heard that international students are prioritized. I could be mistaken though. A lot of students live in the surrounding neighborhoods: Morningside Heights, Harlem, Washington Heights, Upper West Side (especially the \"Manhattan Valley\" section between 96th and 110th). I live in a big prewar building close to campus and got an unusually good covid deal last spring on a studio for $1600 net ($2000/month with two months free).

I've seen some units that looked beautiful online but were covered in bugs and reeked of gas when I got there for a tour.

Another option is to look for a room in a shared apartment, which a lot of people also do but I'm not sure about the best way to go about that.\n2. Academics: The model schedule on the J-school website gives you a pretty accurate sense of the structure of the M.S. Classes are pass/fail, and it's VERY hard to fail as long as you do the work. Honors is only awarded to 1 out of 8 students per class (2 out of 16 etc). I do not really like this system since it makes it feel like a competition, but I guess it's the only possible one in a pass/fail program. Getting honors is nice but at the end of the day it's not really gonna make or break you. But most people don't care about it so it's not like everyone is trying to sabotage each other or anything. Actually it's the opposite - the students here are really helpful to each other and willing to direct you towards sources etc.\n\nReporting: you get sent out to cover things going on in NYC and write them up in the daily copy/AP style. Some sections assign individual students a beat, others have whole-class beats, and others put a lot of emphasis on finding stories on your own (that was mine). It was an intense experience with quick turnaround and hard deadlines, but you get close with your class and develop a sort of camaraderie through struggling through it together. You might get some tough stories, like I had to go to the family of a shooting victim for a crime story (they weren't home thank god but it was really nerve-wracking). By the end of it you'll have progressed a lot in your ability to write and report out a news story.\n\nInvestigative techniques was alright. It's hard to really go in-depth on any of them in 7 weeks, so we ended up getting assigned hugely broad assignments based on minimal experience with each technique.\n\nWritten word was nice, but also too short IMO. I was in Feature Writing and we didn't actually end up writing a feature, but more learned the techniques of structuring one and we wrote a weird sort of profile of a random place in the city. I do feel like it was helpful though and really liked my professor.\n\nEthics was kind of interesting, but sometimes felt like filler. We had a lot of really awesome guest speakers though. Law gave an unmanageably/unnecessarily huge reading load, but the final was take-home so as long as you pay attention in class and do at least some of the reading you're fine. The info is good to know but a lot of the class was just people asking about unrealistic hypothetical situations where you'd get sued.\n\nAudio I: loved it. You pretty thoroughly learn the basics of recording and radio writing/production/broadcast in a short amount of time, and it can be a lot of fun.\n\nMaster's project: honestly not as daunting as it might seem. Kind of like doing a really long assignment from your reporting + written word class, if you do a written project. You get a decent amount of time to work on it, but you should try to get as much done as early as possible so you aren't stressed at the last minute. For advisors you send in a ranked list of possible choices, but most people don't end up getting their first (or even any) choice. My advisor was really good but demanding. Some have more hands-off advisors, others really hate theirs.

I live in New York City, so thankfully I haven\u2019t yet come across anyone in my social circles who isn\u2019t chill about lgbtq stuff. But in my hometown not too far from the city, and even here from time to time, I do feel more guarded.\n\nI guess in my case it\u2019s not so much that I can\u2019t befriend or trust straight guys. In general, I find it easy to get along and make friends with them. Half of my friends are men and half are women, and most of my guy friends are straight. All of them have been nothing but accepting, which I\u2019m really grateful for since that unfortunately isn\u2019t the case for a lot of others. For me, it\u2019s more like when I\u2019m out and about, I feel self conscious about whether I\u2019m coming up on strangers\u2019 gaydar through some little thing I\u2019m not even thinking about. Stuff like my walk or my voice or some other mannerism that subtly outs me to people who might be homophobic. I don\u2019t go about my day in fear or anything, not at all, but I do think about these kinds of things more than you might expect, particularly when I\u2019m around men who give off a socially conservative vibe. I should add that I\u2019m not someone who usually gets pegged as gay, and even so I feel compelled to put up a front when I\u2019m around certain (presumed) straight guys I come across. It\u2019s entirely possible that they\u2019re not homophobic and just seem like they could be, so it\u2019s probably unfair of me to make those kinds of judgments, but I tend to go with my gut for better or worse. (To reiterate, this isn\u2019t the case for the vast majority of straight guys I encounter. I\u2019m pretty open about being gay and have luckily never experienced any sort of negative reaction). \n\nI can\u2019t speak to what your area is like and how accepting it is of gay people, so I\u2019m not sure how relevant my situation is. I will say though that I think a lot of times, my feelings of tension are probably me projecting my personal insecurities onto others. Again, maybe where you are there\u2019s a higher likelihood that people are actually homophobic and it\u2019s safer for you to be more cautious. Regardless, I get the anxiety you have around this and it\u2019s something that a lot of people experience, even in more progressive places. As for your roommate situation, I think it\u2019d be good to try and be friendlier towards him, even though you\u2019re nervous. Unless he\u2019s given you clear reason to think that he\u2019s homophobic, you might want to think about your assumptions about him and whether they\u2019re premature.", "created_utc": "1643181997.0", "edited": "1643183423.0", "id": "hu9mvxm", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_sci49u", "parent_id": "t3_sci49u", "score": "1", "subreddit": "gaybros", "subreddit_id": "t5_2tdzg"}, {"author": "NegativeSheepherder", "body": "Source: from Nassau, live in Manhattan\n\nI don\u2019t know if there\u2019s really a specific Long Island accent so much as some LI\u2019ers, especially older ones, preserving NYC accents from a long time ago. A lot of Long Island didn\u2019t really develop into dense suburbs until the mid 20th century, when a lot of Italians/Irish/Jews left the outer boroughs especially and settled in Nassau/Suffolk. I\u2019m not sure why it kind of died out in the 5 boroughs, though. My guess is demographic changes in the second half of the century (like more people from Caribbean, China, South/Central America) and exposure to mass media standardizing younger people\u2019s accents. \n\nI agree that class and ethnicity have more of an impact than geography. My dad is Latino and grew up in Hamilton Heights in the 60s, then in Flushing in the 70s. My mom is Italian American and grew up in Nassau at the same time. Both of them sound pretty similar and have what you might call a NY/LI accent, but if you listen to my dad you can hear a slight NYC Spanish influence that\u2019s really subtly different from my the way my mom talks. I myself don\u2019t really have the accent, except that I tend to pronounce \u201cwater\u201d as \u201cwauter,\u201d \u201cdog\u201d as \u201cdawg,\u201d \u201cwalk\u201d and \u201ctalk\u201d as \u201cwauk\u201d and \u201ctauk,\u201d respectively. I also say \u201chorrible\u201d and \u201corange\u201d as something close to \u201charrible\u201d and \u201carange\u201d; my friend from California thinks that\u2019s really amusing. When I was living in Chicago people pegged me as having a New York accent but not a specifically Long Island one. One of my best friends is Jewish from the North Shore and he has a slightly different version of the accent but it\u2019s hard to put my finger on how exactly it\u2019s different. I think it\u2019s a certain vowel but I can\u2019t remember. \n\nBut anyway it\u2019s really odd how much the strength of the accent varies, even within families. My grandmother grew up in East New York in the 30s and she doesn\u2019t really have a noticeable accent, whereas my grandfather who grew up in Elmhurst at the same time had a stronger one. But he didn\u2019t really sound that different from my aunts and uncles, who were all born and socialized in Nassau.

Bottom line (per ususal) is that these vaccines do an excellent job at keeping people from getting sick and that's what matters. \n\n\"Our future with SARS-CoV-2, then, will be more about domesticating the virus than eliminating it. With widespread vaccination, many of us will still be exposed, maybe even temporarily colonized, but it won\u2019t often be a big deal. Most of the time, we might not even notice. Positive tests, too, may be less alarming: In the absence of symptoms, detecting hunks of virus might simply indicate that immune cells have squashed the pathogen, leaving only debris behind. The virus will become less of a pathogen, and more of a passenger\u2014one that keeps the defensive wheels turning, for the short time that it\u2019s there.\"", "created_utc": "1631298680.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hccd141", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_ond5my", "parent_id": "t3_ond5my", "score": "18", "subreddit": "MaamThisIsGoodNews", "subreddit_id": "t5_3j9h3y"}, {"author": "NegativeSheepherder", "body": "GREAT column by David Leonhardt at the NYT about breakthrough infections.

They find that:\n\n* Persistent symptoms after covid infection are not unexpected, as other common respiratory infections can cause lingering coughs/fatigue/loss of smell. In other words, it's not necessarily a sign of permanent damage if symptoms take a little while longer than expected to resolve.\n* Some people use \"long covid\" to describe more serious types of damage following serious cases, including ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome) after mechanical ventilation. Vaccination is highly effective at preventing this type of \"long covid,\" and even currently unvaccinated children are at low risk of experiencing this. \n* Others use \"long covid\" to describe a vague condition of brain fog, fatigue, pain, and other symptoms. But there might not be a 1 to 1 link between the coronavirus and this set of variable symptoms. Many people with this type of long covid do not have any evidence of prior infection - antibody tests aren't perfect but they still are pretty reliable. One study found that symptoms did not vary between those with and without prior infection. It's possible that some of these cases are the body's response to psychological trauma in the wake of the pandemic. \n* Nonetheless, it's important to ensure that long covid patients get adequate attention and treatment.", "created_utc": "1629341471.0", "edited": "False", "id": "h9hk8bi", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_ond5my", "parent_id": "t3_ond5my", "score": "16", "subreddit": "MaamThisIsGoodNews", "subreddit_id": "t5_3j9h3y"}, {"author": "NegativeSheepherder", "body": "Looked at the NY Times case tracker today and here are some positive findings: \n\n- Cases seem to have peaked in Spain and have been declining steadily.\n- Cases have seemed to peaked/plateaued in France; Italy seems to also be peaking/plateauing.

History = the academic subject; story = plot, narrative.\n* Be careful with transition words. You can translate \"ent\u00e3o\" as \"so,\" but also as \"then\"; it also depends on the context. To indicate a sequence of events, translate it as \"then.\" Also, be sure to use \"while\" instead of \"when\" if you're describing an action that interrupts another one (example: While I was cooking, I got a phone call. ~~When I was cooking, I got a phone call.)~~\n* English doesn't put articles in front of people's names, so \"o Totoro\" in Portuguese is just \"Totoro\" in English. Sometimes, though, with mythical creatures we use \"the\" in the way you did if the creature is the only one of its kind (like \"the Loch Ness Monster\" or \"the Abominable Snowman\"). You would need to consistently repeat \"the Totoro\" if that were the case, but it seems like Totoro is the character's name. \n* I haven't seen the full movie, but I saw the scene where Totoro helps the girls plant the trees and I don't think \"plantation\" is the right word for that. \"Plantations\" are large pieces of land where a specific crop is grown for sale or export (like coffee, sugar, cotton, rubber). I would say he helps them plant a small forest for their mother.\n* When you're telling a story, try to be consistent with the tense you use.

Therefore, once they gaze at those things, it springs to their minds the pleasure they could get.\\]Nevertheless, I do believe advertisers take into account trends and cultural movements ~~culture, the revival of certain movements we sometimes undergo~~. \\[For instance, if adolescents are craving ~~for~~ attention, advertisers will relate 'getting attention' to the product they have to sell.\\] **Unfortunately** ~~Lamentably~~, even if they forget about the advertisement, that idea will ~~hit upon them, since it~~ always remain **in their subconscious** ~~subcounsciously~~.

After all, money is at a premium.\n\nSome notes:\n\n* Remember to put an apostrophe after plural nouns to make them possessive. Teenager's = of one teenager; teenagers' = of multiple teenagers, or of teenagers in general\n* \"Within the marketplace\" sounds a bit awkward; to sound more natural, you can either say \"on the market\" or \"in the marketplace\" (I think the first one sounds better but either is ok IMO).\n* \"Get a profit\" doesn't sound right to me; instead, you can say \"turn a profit\" or \"make a profit\" or \"profit\" (as in \"They yearn to profit from it\").\n* Where you say \"for that\" - are you by any chance translating \"por eso\" or \"por isso\" from Spanish/Portuguese? \"For that\" doesn't quite work in that context; you could either say \"in order to do that,\" like I wrote, or (if you meant something closer to \"por eso\"/\"por isso\") \"that's why\"/ \"therefore.\"\n* The sentences I put in brackets were a little bit unclear. In the first set of brackets, it seems like you wanted to say that the advertisers want to create a subconscious association between the product and a feeling of pleasure. Is that what you meant? In the second set, it seems like you meant something similar, but this time the advertisers convince teenagers that having the product will help them attract attention/make them popular.

I was worried about possible exposure, although as precaution she wore a mask around us after coming back and generally stayed apart from us when she could. However, right before she developed symptoms (ie most contagious) she went on an unmasked walk with my 65 year old dad (unvaccinated at the time; my mom was fully vaccinated). \n\nOne week later: my sister is fully recovered and no longer contagious (she\u2019s still wearing a mask around us for a bit just in case). Her case was really mild, just one day of fever + headache, then mostly just sinus irritation - no loss of taste or smell, no coughing or breathing issues at all. My dad had to be tested anyway because of a prescheduled doctor\u2019s visit and tested negative. I was not tested but never developed symptoms and was around her less than my dad, so I assume I was negative as well. \n\nSo I guess the takeaway is just confirmation that masks really do work, outdoor transmission is not really something to worry about, nor are fleeting encounters, and that even if you do get covid, it won\u2019t necessarily be a super severe long haul case with tons of frightening symptoms (obv some people do unfortunately get severely ill, but it\u2019s not inevitable for everyone).", "created_utc": "1616467826.0", "edited": "False", "id": "grvy94p", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_kzh7qs", "parent_id": "t3_kzh7qs", "score": "25", "subreddit": "MaamThisIsGoodNews", "subreddit_id": "t5_3j9h3y"}, {"author": "NegativeSheepherder", "body": "I\u2019ve been on lamotrigine since around New Year\u2019s, tapering up to 200mg (my current dose).

At any rate, unlike the UK one it\u2019s not expected to become the dominant variant, at least not in the US. \n- The issue with this one is that it partially gets around the immune response to the older variants and current vaccines, but not nearly enough to render them ineffective. In particular the mRNA ones maintain good neutralizing ability against it, as does J&J (apparently AZ has claimed that it has evidence that it\u2019s also still good against it, contrary to preliminary reports, but I\u2019m not sure what the story is there).\n- Those who recover from it have immunity to older variants as well (there\u2019s so far good evidence on this). \n- South Africa, where this variant is dominant, was able to bring their second outbreak under control without vaccines and pretty quickly. \n- All in all it\u2019s something for the vaccine makers to be aware of but certainly not an end of the world scenario. \n\nNYC: \n\n- There\u2019s been some speculation about a \u201cNew York Variant\u201d that was the subject of a controversial NYT report last month. I haven\u2019t really been following the news on it since then and if I\u2019m remembering correctly the variant in question is a variant of interest but not a variant of concern (the only variants of concern so far are UK, South Africa, and Brazil, which is apparently similar to the SA one). \n- Temperatures are still pretty cold in the Northeast, so we haven\u2019t really gotten the full benefit of spring weather/everyone going outdoors yet. \n- Govt response has been pretty bad here. The state is reopening quickly while cases are still relatively high - perhaps not as quickly as Texas, but quicker than you would expect in a \u201cblue\u201d state. NYC reopened indoor dining last month when cases were higher than they were when it was closed down; on Long Island where I am basically everything remained open to some extent, even as cases were higher than at the peak of the first wave.

The concern with the SA variant is that it has a mutation that has a detrimental effect on antibodies\u2019 ability to attack the spike protein, but it\u2019s DEFINITELY not able to completely evade antibodies from natural immunity or any vaccines, plus there is more to the immune system than antibodies.

Here\u2019s a summary:\n\n- Recovery from pneumonia and other viral infections (even common colds) often takes a while, so covid is not unique in that respect.\n- Covid can cause specific, diagnosable organ issues, mostly in severe cases (myocarditis etc), but these are rare and there is not usually a specific, diagnosable problem with cases of \u201clong covid\u201d\n- Discrepancy between worst affected demographics and long covid demographics \n- Difficult to establish a causal relationship between prior covid infection and problems like cognitive impairment and psychosis. These problems affect thousands of people per year regardless of pandemic, and many individuals who have had covid will inevitably be among those thousands.  \n- 2/3 in a survey of long covid patients did not have positive antibody test results. Possibility that there are some false negatives and that antibodies waned in some, but antibodies in most people remain relatively stable and antibody test results are generally stable over time as well. \n- No established difference in long covid symptoms between seropositive and seronegative patients\n- Long covid symptoms are usually nonspecific and many of them (headache, hair loss, gastrointestinal problems) affected large numbers of people before covid emerged. \n- To be clear, long covid patients are not lying about their plight. They are experiencing real symptoms, but ones that are also extremely common in clinical anxiety and depression. In other words, they could be experiencing mental health issues due to the grief, uncertainty, and isolation of the pandemic. Depression and anxiety can manifest as intense physical symptoms that sometimes are more debilitating than psychological ones.\n- Association between mild covid infection and frightening long term squelae should not be made without firm scientific evidence. Doing so could lead to harmful unnecessary treatments or pushing of pseudoscientific miracle cures (see: Chronic Lyme). \n- More studies should be made into long term effects of covid and we should continue working to end the pandemic. \n\nThis is not necessarily \u201cnews,\u201d but I thought it was helpful to have an expert opinion on the long covid phenomenon that pushes back against some of the most hyperbolic clickbait coverage.", "created_utc": "1612420400.0", "edited": "1612421245.0", "id": "glylvpr", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_kzh7qs", "parent_id": "t3_kzh7qs", "score": "19", "subreddit": "MaamThisIsGoodNews", "subreddit_id": "t5_3j9h3y"}, {"author": "NegativeSheepherder", "body": "Restaurant workers, taxi drivers, residents in group homes for developmental disability are being added to Phase 1b eligibility in New York State", "created_utc": "1612407798.0", "edited": "False", "id": "gly07zf", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_kzh7qs", "parent_id": "t3_kzh7qs", "score": "25", "subreddit": "MaamThisIsGoodNews", "subreddit_id": "t5_3j9h3y"}, {"author": "NegativeSheepherder", "body": "Last I saw Australia does plan to vaccinate something like 80% of its population by fall, but not sure why they\u2019re waiting on authorization when so many other countries have already.

There are other branches of the immune system that can fend off illness, experts said, so antibody levels don\u2019t present the full picture.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not the whole immune response,\u201d said Dr. Paul Elliott, an epidemiologist at Imperial College London who leads the project. The results also indicate the prevalence of antibodies over time at a population level, and not in specific individuals, he added.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re saying the antibody response has declined below the threshold,\u201d Dr. Elliott said. \u201cThis is not a surprise to anyone who works in the field. Studies of individual people also show this.\u201d\n\nSome news articles also raised fears about the ability of vaccines to help populations reach herd immunity, the point at which enough people would be immune to the coronavirus to thwart its spread.\n\nBut experts said these fears, too, were unwarranted. \u201cThe vaccine doesn\u2019t have to mimic or mirror the natural infection,\u201d said Shane Crotty, a virologist at the La Jolla Institute for Immunology. \u201cCertainly I wouldn\u2019t be alarmist about these data.\u201d\n\n[https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/10/27/world/covid-19-coronavirus-updates/a-study-finds-declining-antibodies-in-britain-but-experts-say-its-not-cause-for-concern](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/10/27/world/covid-19-coronavirus-updates/a-study-finds-declining-antibodies-in-britain-but-experts-say-its-not-cause-for-concern)", "created_utc": "1603822859.0", "edited": "False", "id": "gaaq5sc", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_ioy7uo", "parent_id": "t3_ioy7uo", "score": "28", "subreddit": "Anxiety", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qmij"}, {"author": "NegativeSheepherder", "body": "He\u2019s said a few times that he expects enough doses for the entire population by April or so, so that sounds about right.

I forget where but as far as I\u2019m aware they\u2019ve found memory B cells to the new coronavirus which resemble those to SARS, which people are still immune to 17-18 years on. \n\n2. There will likely be multiple vaccines out next year, and the preliminary data seems promising for some of the frontrunners so far. Even if one or another doesn\u2019t cause sterilizing immunity, it could still bring the severity of the disease to the level of a common cold coronavirus. Even a partially effective one will slow the spread as well and give people some pre-existing immunity as is the case with influenza. \n\n3. Testing will likely improve this fall as more and more rapid testing kits are approved. (I saw this in a NYT article today, forget which one though). \n\n4. Some people may have some degree of pre-existing immunity due to previous exposure to other coronaviruses (IIRC betacoronaviruses from animals). This could lower the herd immunity threshold. \n\n5. Even though they\u2019ve been inconsistent with messaging, people like Fauci and Redfield are still predicting a return to normal life next year. It\u2019s possible that they\u2019re giving more conservative estimates on the timeline, but even in the worst case scenario they\u2019re saying as of now late Q2/early Q3 of next year, which is roughly June/July.

As far as I\u2019m aware the two also differ in that HIV/retroviruses can stay dormant in your body somehow and reactivate, whereas the coronavirus does not have this property.

In the article itself it makes the point that most diseases aren\u2019t completely eradicated by vaccines, which is true, and if I recall correctly the substance of the text didn\u2019t imply that our current situation is \u201cthe new normal.\u201d But you\u2019re probably not going to click on something that says, \u201cMost diseases not eradicated by vaccines but brought to manageably low levels that allow for normal social interaction.\u201d And then in the article there\u2019s an assertion that the vaccine for covid will be like a flu shot in that we\u2019ll have to get it regularly.

My advice is to keep yourself generally informed about scientific research coming out (but to be a reasonably critical reader with that too), much of which is terribly presented in the media (case in point: the narrative of fading antibodies = no immunity).

Then he seems to assume that if it\u2019s approved there isn\u2019t any supply to go around and we\u2019ll have to wait a significant amount of time for mass production, but a number of the phase III vaccines are already being mass produced at risk. He also seems to assume that the first vaccines won\u2019t be very effective, but there\u2019s not a whole lot of evidence so far to suggest that they won\u2019t work well; the early vaccines might be more effective or less effective, but we don\u2019t know for sure either way, except that some of the further along ones seem promising. And with what we now know from recent studies, immunity even in asymptomatic and mild cases may last for at least 17 years (based on similarities in immune response to SARS-1, which people are still immune to 17 years on with no sign of waning immunity); I saw no mention in the article of the implications that this could have on slowing down the spread, especially once a vaccine - even a not hugely effective one - is available. \n\nI think the issue with articles like this is that the authors try and show how intelligent they are by being the most cynical, as if to believe anything but the worst case scenario is foolish.

But there are some things I\u2019ve seen lately in reputable sources (NYT mostly) that seem to suggest: (1) more than one vaccine has had good Phase I/II data, producing a robust immune response, and a vaccine (maybe even multiple vaccines) will likely be available either by the end of 2020 or early next year; (2) people who have already had the coronavirus will likely have long term immunity (not clear exactly how long but there\u2019s a good chance long enough to last through the rest of the pandemic at least); (3) the herd immunity threshold may be much lower than the 80% often cited, since that number makes certain assumptions that haven\u2019t played out (like everyone in a community being equally susceptible and everyone interacting with everyone else) and doesn\u2019t take long term immunity into account. In that case, it\u2019s really hard to see the pandemic lasting multiple years. In the CNBC article itself there are scientists quoted who seem to think regular education will resume next year (or at least not in several years). Fauci has also said that he expects society to return to normal operation by the end of next year at the latest.

I feel like so much was taken away from me so suddenly. I\u2019m a senior in college and I left for spring break not realizing that I\u2019d never come back and would never get to say goodbye to most of my friends there. My graduation was cancelled. I was accepted to grad school at Columbia University but I had to turn it down because it would be online and it wouldn\u2019t really work for my program. I have no job prospects since the economy crashed and journalism jobs are probably gonna be some of the first to go. I\u2019ve never been in a relationship and that\u2019s not going to happen anymore.\n\nOn top of that I found a few activities that help me somewhat - language learning and reading - but I have zoom classes and a really crushing workload so I don\u2019t even have time to do things to relax a little. My grades are going down the toilet bc of my mental health and now I have to reapply to grad school since Columbia isn\u2019t allowing deferrals.\n\nAnd then the anxiety kicks in. I\u2019ve had really bad anxiety for most of my life but since a bad run-in with ecstasy (one time!) gave me persistent vision and neurological issues I\u2019ve been constantly on edge for the past year about my health. I was finally starting to get over it as I got back to school after Christmas but then this all started obviously. I keep freaking out about the long term effects of the coronavirus since I keep seeing all of these horrible articles saying that you could have all sorts of terrifying permanent problems even after a mild case of it. I don\u2019t know if I had it or not (I don\u2019t think so since I haven\u2019t had any of the major symptoms) but can\u2019t know for sure and the thought of long term damage is so frightening to me. \n\nPlus all of this business about basically a multi year lockdown/\u201cnew normal\u201d scares the shit out of me.

I even saw an article yesterday saying that the pandemic might never end and that there might be permanent social distancing and yearly 3-month lockdowns. \n\nI\u2019m just so upset that this could be what the rest of my life looks like and my 20\u2019s are completely ruined.
