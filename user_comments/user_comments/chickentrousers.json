The red and black also have the advantage of making it look kinda socialist (see: [People's Republic of South Yorkshire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People's_Republic_of_South_Yorkshire)).\n\nThat's also the point behind the sword. The yorkshire rose should be relatively self explanatory (I debated making it pure black and white, but couldn't get my images to work right for that).\n\nAlso, I picked that sword because I didn't want it to end up looking like a football flag. I really like how the sword/rose look on [united's badge](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/9c/Sheffield_United_FC_logo.svg/402px-Sheffield_United_FC_logo.svg.png), but that'd only represent (the best) half of the city. I also kinda like how one sword looks on a flag. \n\nI also half debated putting a sheaf of wheat on there instead of the yorkshire rose, but idk if that's a good or bad idea. \n\nAnyhoo, it's probably rubbish, but I like the idea of making UK city flags. It's not a thing we really do. I have a fun idea for Preston, but I have to get programmes to co-operate with me for that as it's tricksy.

Ri...\n\n\"Good afternoon, Department of Penalties and Remittances.\" \n\nAn answer! An answer, finally! He grinned at the others and nodded. Maybe today would be the day. Maybe someone would actually tell you what you *needed* to do. He was sure, once he knew what to do, once he knew how to get this fixed, it couldn't be too hard, could it?\n\n\"Oh, hello...\" He can't quite hide his surprise that there was an answer. This was going to be his day, he just knew it. \n\n\"Yes?\" \n\n\"Oh, right, yes. I received this letter from you. I, um, seem to have been mis-assigned. It says I've been given a place in Mid-Level Hell, Section 2b.\"\n\n\"Do you have the reference number?\"\n\nHe fumbled with the papers. What reference number? There were... letters, an address, a long code...\n\n\"Um, A-F-B-7-/\"\n\n\"No, no, sir, the *reference* number.\"\n\n\"That's not the reference number?\"\n\n\"No.\" No explanation. Just. No. \n\n\"Uh... oh, um, this one at the bottom?\" Silence. No help was forthcoming. Try it. \n\nHe looked across at the others. They could only hear his end of the conversation, but their faces were already falling a little. They'd thought this would be simple once they got an answer. He gave them a wry smile, and read the second number.\n\n\"94732/a/7/b?\"\n\nNow. Now he heard the clickity clack of someone angrily typing. Maybe not angry. Maybe just jabbing the keys with the force of someone who'd had a very long day and was taking it out on the letter A. He grinned again, his optimism getting the better of him. This would be it. They'd sort it. Yep. \n\n\"Oh...\" She was thinking. It was that kind of sound when you knew someone was reading something. Long pause. \n\n\"You're going to have to contact your case worker.\"\n\n\"That isn't you?\"\n\n\"Oh no. I just answer these phones. I don't make decisions. They do.\"\n\n\"Right.\" His voice dropped. The shoulders of the others slumped. If there was no hope for him, there was no hope for them. \"So.. is there somewhere I can go and see them? This address is only one section away from me. Maybe a meeting might clear this all up.\" Go getting attitude. Never give up. That's what they wanted. \n\n\"Oh, we couldn't do that, sir. You'll have to call them or write a letter.\" \n\n\"I died in 2045. And you want me to *write* a letter.\" \n\n\"Or call them. But you'll have to write in if you want your decision changing.\" \n\n\"Can't I send an email at least?\" \n\n\"Oh, gosh no, we don't do those. It's not secure. I guess the caseworker might have a fax machine.\" \n\n\"Did... fax... *fax*?\" He was starting to lose the will to live. Well... exist, he supposed. But no. This was how they got you. This was how they made you think you were stuck. There were procedures. He could sort this. Just keep going. \n\n\"I... I think I know some one with a pen. Where do I need to write to?\"\n\n\"Oh, well, I'd call them first. They can explain their decision fully, I'm sure.\"\n\n\"If you're sure of that, can't you explain it to me?\"\n\n\"No. Well above my pay grade.\" \n\n\"Great... what's the number?\" \n\n\"It'll be on your letter. We don't just give them out.\"\n\n\"I... right.\" \n\nHe hung up and shuffled through the paperwork. One of these letters would have the correct number on it. One of these days, he would get the right one. He'd speak to the case worker. Explain he'd sent all of the evidence requested. Well, except that one letter the housing people had requested from him. And the other one the council of Section 2b had asked for. But they had to understand that in the end. He'd been a good bloke. He'd sent the evidence. He didn't deserve 2b. No.\n\nHe folded the letter in two and added it to the pile on the floor. That number was no good. \n\nThe lady across from him sighed and picked up her pile of paperwork. \"I'll try my next number, then? Maybe this time I won't get the ones that only spoke Latvian.\" \n\n\"Maybe I'll learn Latvian before my next call.\" One of the younger blokes chipped in as he passed the phone across to her. \n\nA grumpy old man in the corner chipped in, \"Nah, then they'll only speak Ibo or something.\" \n\nThe first man spoke up again, \"Don't start with that. We're not going to stop. Or give up. It's what they want. They haven't won until we quit. Until we accept that this is all we've got. All we've got for the rest of eternity. 2b.\"\n\n\"2b's not so bad.\" It was a small voice in the corner. She'd listened to the whole conversation and was starting to sink. \"I mean. It's not really fair... I get that, but what if we bug them so much we end up in 4a?\"\n\n\"You get put with Gadaffi for bugging them? God, what would you get for sending them a rude letter?\"\n\n\"Laughed at, then sent to 5b.\" \n\n\"I'm being serious, though. They're not going to help, they're just going to make it worse. We should just settle for this. It's okay. Not great, not right, not fair, but... there's food, and we don't have to share the section with the real bad guys.\" She shrugged, a little weakly. Like she almost felt guilty for just accepting it.\n\n\"That's it. That's what we're fighting. Not the system, not a machine, not the reams of bureaucrats on the end of the phone. Ourselves. They don't have to do much, just obfuscate until we give in. They didn't ask my name. Have they ever asked yours?\" He looked pointedly at the man sat in a cheap polyester suit and ugly glasses, \"You've been here forever. Do you even remember your name? It doesn't matter to them. Nothing matters to them. None of these numbers are real. But if we sit here and accept it... what do we have to live for then? What kind of hope do we have that something could change? I'd rather live with a little bit of false hope than a grey, nameless, pointless existence. Are you going to call, Sue?\" \n\nThe lady, phone in hand, looked up to him. She dialled. \n\n\n---------\n\nBit long and rambly, apologies. I took the scenic route to that end. :P\n\nEdit: Changed my mind about using 2nd person halfway in. forgot to change one.

Through a series of utter flukes, I'm 5th in the PL. Second season there. First one, I was tipped to finish bottom, spent most of the first half of the season with way too few players, padding my bench with children and I was 19th in November and struggling. The board magicked up some funds for January (they'd spent most of my potential transfer money on a new ground), I got a few good players in (two frees, one bought, a loan), I switched tactics a bit, beat Liverpool 3-0 and rescued my arse. I would have settled for 17th. We finished 10th. \r\n\r\nThis season was good but wobbly at the start. I got real transfer money in may and went crazy. I bought every bargain in a useful position I could see. Kinda forgot I'd have to pay them all wages. So I sign half of them, adjust my budgets and now I have *the worst* dilemma. I have good players not playing because the other dude is also playing great and I don't want to break his momentum. All my new guys have to get used to my tactics, so it takes us a while to get going. But November has been excellent and we've carefully shuftied up to 5th. I will be cool with this season if we finish higher than last. But extra happy if we get Europe.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, my tiny 7000 capacity ground has sold out it's season tickets and the board still won't fund better youth stuff. They've improved it a bit, but it's still shit. So I'm spending money on good youth players instead. Seems to be working.
