This is so similar to my experience. The towel folding especially.

Now that she has I\u2019m surrounded by all the \u201cstuff\u201d that I don\u2019t know what to do with, as well as another relative\u2019s who dropped theirs off because \u201cmy mom would\u2019ve wanted it\u201d. \n\nI live with other family members who are doing nothing to address all this \u201cstuff\u201d so that, plus the underlying mental issues which you describe are driving me crazy.

I\u2019m now overwhelmed. I go on binges sometimes to buy things for some imaginary life I \u201ccould\u201d have in the future.
