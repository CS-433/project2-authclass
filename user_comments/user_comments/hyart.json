It'd be worse if you get hit over your ear, or something like that. In my opinion, the real issue is the sum of all of the shinai clashing noises over the extended period. Wearing the men muffles some of that noise, actually. But who knows if it is enough to be \"protective.\"\n\nI've tried many kinds of earplugs during practice.. Some work much, muich better than others. I cannot say anything scientific about it, but, my intuition is that they didn't make much of a difference for me. But everyone is different. If you can spare the money, it doesn't hurt to try, and, if you can keep up with practice while wearing them, then it won't do any harm to wear them. So, why not?\n\nSome kinds of earplugs are specifically made not to interfere with hearing \"too much.\" One kind are for people like musicians, and they make everything evenly quieter but without distorting the sound too much. The other kind is for shooting guns, and are made to block only loud percussive sounds while letting quieter sounds go by relatively unimpeded. IME these are both better than general use earplugs, but they both unquestionably less protective.\n\nThe single best earplug I've ever used for kendo are Earasers (specs at: https://www.earasers.net/pages/specifications). The standard ones are non-distorting and they are tiny and so they are not uncomfortable under the men.\n\nThe other type sounds like it would be ideal, but I have never found one that is small enough not to be uncomfortable under my men.

The soft bottle is great because I just roll it up when it's empty so it has no bulk when going through security. So, I just cow hitch the handle.

When the tray table is in the upright and locked position, I might pass the other ends underneath the lock and put a stopper (figure 8) to hold it there. Or the the ends together with a sheet bend and put the lock through the loop.

It's the first \"real knot\" I learned so it's the one that I have the most practice with. I think most well known hitches would be fine for hanging bags and so really the main thing in how secure it is will be how well practiced you are with tying it. Is it natural enough for you that you'll get it tied and dressed properly when you're bent over at a weird angle because it's all crowded, and that person over there is staring at you, and you're rushing and a bit distracted because you just heard something about your flight get announced but you're not quite sure what it was.

I rushed it, it wasn't set and dressed right, and it came undone.\n\nThere are some knots I feel fairly comfortable with but they never seem to come out right when someone is watching me. Siberian hitch is one of those. It's funny because it's so fast and easy to tie that it feels like it's good for those kinds of rushed airport situations, except when I feel like anyone is watching I always seem to screw it up 5 times and then shamefully end up going back to a bowline.

The idea was to explain what makes a knot unsafe.\n\nI made a comment in a knot ID request post describing this knot as unsafe but without explanation, so I thought I should offer one.\n\nAshley identifies this knot as:\n\n> 1445. But here is the worst SINGLE CARRICK BEND, shown by Knight, Nares, Todd and Whall, Henderson, etc. It slipped with an average of 2.6 jerks. Only one of all the other knots tested was worse han this.\n\nI don't have a *scientific* theory about why this particular bend is unsafe, but my intuition is that this knot works against itself.\n\nTension on the leg in the direction of the blue arrow naturally tries to straighten that leg. Tension on the opposite leg tries to do the same on it's leg. You can see from the angles here that this straightening works against the tightening of the other loop. Because each leg needs the other loop to nip it against it's bitter end, ISTM this means that the tension on the line directly opposes it's ability to nip properly.\n\nThe loop version of this knot would not generally have this problem, because one leg of the loop is the same part of the line as the standing end. Pulling on that leg and the standing end tightens one of the turns. So as long as both legs of the loop are engaged, it seems like that would remain stable.\n\nThis knot does have the same problem as many others, in that since each side of the knot requires tension from the other for it's nip, it is vulnerable to slipping from repeated loading/unloading. I think this one is worse than many others in that way because it has two 270 degree turns, vs two 180 like in a reef knot, or one of each in a sheet bend, which gives it more of a tendency to open up in a stiff line. combined with the aforementioned behavior of not really \"wanting\" to be set all the way, it seems to me to be especially easy to self-loosen.\n\nSo that is all conjecture, not science, and it may be complete garbage.

You're also describing the well worn trope of the midlife crisis.\n\nI don't know your husband so I can't say what is going on with him or if his path, and yours, would have any resemblance to mine. So I can't say anything is wrong, but I think you are wise to be concerned.\n\nAgain, he may not be like me, but I am like this to cover a very deep pit of insecurity. My father died when I was a teenager and he was a model of masculine independence. He left me believing that the purpose of a Man is to provide. To be an economic machine. A tool in the service of family, of company, of country. I work desperately because it's the only way I know to be.\n\nSo the one thing that 100% definitely does not work for someone like me is to be told not to work so hard, or that other things matter. A person like me can understand that self-care is important only in that it is necessary for me to keep going and to keep working hard. If I don't work then I feel that I am not only valueless, but I'm a leech. What this boils down to is the nihilistic feeling that I must either meaningfully provide, or I would be better off not existing.\n\nBefore my father died, he suffered a stroke and he wasn't able to keep working. It was heartbreaking to see his sense of personal value and identity annihilated by that stroke. It was a living nightmare for him. It took me years of therapy to understand this and to see how my own life is on a similar trajectory.\n\nIf your husband is like me, then financial security will never arrive. I also used to think that there was some magic number in my finances that would be enough but I realized it was a lie. When I hit a goal all I ever did was come up for a reason to increase the numbers. And, frankly, that's the consumption based capitalist Western society wants us to do. Like how soda sizes when I was a kid were like 8 oz and now they are 128 oz. Every day the news tells me my retirement savings isn't going to be enough for any one of a zillion different reasons and that I need to work even harder every day. Somewhere in my mid 40s I realized that I was lying to myself and everyone else when I said I would stop when I hit some financial goal. I understand now that if I stopped then I'd be that leech, and so I can't stop.\n\nI'm a bit older now and I understand better why I work myself into exhaustion and why I have certain other tendencies that are destructive to myself and my personal relationships--both my friendships and my marriage. So what I'm trying to do now is to find a new way of understanding how I can contribute value to the world. I don't know how I can fill the void in my soul that says that I have no inherent value; no value other than what I produce. But, for example, I can understand that there is productive value in making people feel loved and understood and to see the value in sitting quietly and listening and accepting, as opposed to focusing on things to go out to do and to act.\n\nI don't know if any of this is applicable to you, but I hope you are able to find something useful in it.\n\nGood luck to you.", "created_utc": "1661033864.0", "edited": "False", "id": "il4cuwd", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_wth8l4", "parent_id": "t3_wth8l4", "score": "8", "subreddit": "RedditForGrownups", "subreddit_id": "t5_2sh93"}, {"author": "hyart", "body": "Is it reasonable to say something like:\n\nMein Bildschirm ist gebrochen aber noch nicht kaputt.\n\nOr, would this be understood:\n\nIch habe mein Handy fallen lassen.

Some programs focus on overload only with weight instead of also utilizing volume, tempo, isolation, bloodflow restriction, etc. Varying along these other dimensions can keep you safer.\n4. Be clear about your goals: unless you're looking to compete, maybe you actually don't need to focus on overload anymore because you don't actually need to get any stronger in your principal lifts.

If they aren't receptive, then there's basically just two ways to go from there.\n\nYou could just not waste your time and ignore them. In particular, in the dojo, the sensei are not there to teach; we are there to learn. If someone isn't trying to learn, it isn't anyone's job to make them.\n\nIf, however, you really want to break through and to help them, then you have to figure out what is the sort of person that they will listen to, and then show and convince them that you are that kind of person. Sometimes that means giving some \"tough love\" because thrashing someone is a very direct way of showing that you have superior skill and ability. It isn't a productive approach for everyone, though. Some people won't listen to a bully, for example, and so they would require a softer approach that doesn't make them feel abused. For example, really skillful players can forestall the bad stuff while allowing in only the good stuff, in a way that feels natural and not just a gimme, and then they will complement and reinforce the good stuff after practice. In that way a senior player can guide a junior one without resorting to violence. \n\nI believe strongly that in all cases, if you want to help someone, the first step is to get to know them.

It's a thing I apply to kendo, but it isn't something I've learned from it, so maybe I'm off base when it comes to the \"kendo spirit.\"\n\nIf you push people when they are tired, you must accept a certain amount of reduced performance and sloppiness. Rest means that you can demand higher quality movements the rest of the time.\n\nSimilarly, rest and recovery between exercise sessions is to enable more efficient and effective physical adaptation. When you have effective exercising programming that incorporates proper rest and nutritional support, that allows you to push harder during your exercise sessions then you could (or should) otherwise.\n\nTo put it in another context, modern athletes follow modern best practices, which includes ample rest. But they are as athletic, if not more so, then athletes of the past, because they don't actually work less hard. Because of the rest, they work *more* hard over time.\n\nI think there are direct kendo analogies. I wouldn't claim that they are \"correct,\" just a way of thinking about things. For example, after you hit you must relax your body while maintaining your mental engagement in order to be ready to do the next thing. If you stay tense or mentally disengage then you will spoil the next action. I think of breaks as the same thing. You go at 100% for a while, and then you must relax in the middle to be able to do the next part at 100%.

This has literally never been a problem for me with exercise.\n* Heat and humidity. Some materials trap more heat and humidity. I know this isn't the same as the above because this aspect depends on the environment. Like I have no problem with the UA mask when I use it in an air conditioned gym or during the winter, but I feel like I'm suffocating when it's ambient 85 degrees. So clearly it isn't the breathability of the mask itself that is the issue.\n* Water saturation. It's harder to breathe through material that is saturated with water. I can breathe through dry multilayer cotton masks fine, but it is a different story when they are saturated with sweat. Synthetics hold less water.\n* Fit. Masks with bad fit ameliorate all of the issues because air goes through the gaps as the filter material becomes less permeable. For better or worse, the men chi and uchiwa really screw up the fit of most masks. Also, for me, I have a really hard time finding masks that allow me to open my mouth enough to kiai without completely destroying the seal. But, a mask with bad fit doesn't really protect anyone. So if you are going to be OK with this, then you might as well consider using one of those mesh masks that are just for show (i.e., to get around mask mandates as someone who doesn't believe in masks). Or, a mask with a exhalation valve, or something along those lines.

Respect. Respect for each other, for the dojo, for the tradition.\n2.

There's no value in complaining about what is unfair.\n* As an effort to \"improve yourself,\" winning is secondary, so, why should you be offended by being presented by something unusual?\n* I'm sure there are many other \"reasons\" for kendo, but those are, I think, the most common ones.\n\nYou mention \"if one wants to get back to roots\" -- do you think that a primary purpose of kendo ought to be the maintenance of tradition?

For that reason, and I assume others that I know nothing about, there is a whole specific literature on arthroscopic knots (e.g., \nhttps://www.amazon.com/Knots-Orthopedic-Surgery-Arthroscopic-Techniques/dp/3662585685 ).", "created_utc": "1651875534.0", "edited": "False", "id": "i7lwz0a", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_ujfjz8", "parent_id": "t3_ujfjz8", "score": "2", "subreddit": "knots", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r57p"}, {"author": "hyart", "body": "It wouldn't be weird.\n\nIt's true that teenagers aren't common at practice, but, you wouldn't be the first.

It may also cost you some money (though it doesn't have to). If you consistently prioritize work over a healthy lifestyle, then you will never be able to create a sustainable change. \n\nConcretely:\n\nExercise is not a good way to lose weight\\[1\\]. It is critical for maintaining your health, and so it 100% absolutely must not be neglected. Cultivate an active lifecycle. But, you do not need to dive into it like crazy because it won't make a lot of difference in the short term. Exercise will also get easier and more enjoyable as her weight comes down. If you go too hard in the beginning, it will be unpleasant and counterproductive.\n\nInitially, you must focus primarily on improving your diet. It's difficult to make concrete suggestions here because this depends on a lot on your personal situation. But as a very basic first step, you can focus on reducing the calorie density of your food. Just look at calories per gram in your diet and work on reducing that number. Doing that will naturally push a lot of other stuff in the right direction (high fat and highly processed foods always have higher calorie density). It isn't perfect, but, again, how to put together a healthy and sustainable diet depends a lot on your particular situation. You could consider finding a nutritionist or similar to work with to take steps to improve your diet.\n\nLast word: you might be a little late to the party, but, you made it. You didn't hide from it and pretend like nothing's wrong. You are facing up to it. That's tough, and you are courageous for facing up to it. Feel good about that, and push forward to make the necessary changes.

Like adults sometimes excuse themselves to go the bathroom. Nobody really notices unless they make a big deal of it. Even if they do it in a rush. It definitely *feels* super obvious, but it doesn't necessarily *look* to others as big as it feels.\n\nPeople also, I think, pay attention to the whole person and not just the bad bits. If you are clearly engaged and devoted the vast majority of the time, then they are more than likely going to be forgiving of the periodic lapse. You can reflect on your own observations and feelings of people to see this.\n\nI think it is very important to understand that mental health is like physical health. If someone sprains their ankle in practice, only the real jerks are going to give them a hard time about bowing or sonkyo. If somebody gets vertigo and is about to vomit, nobody is going to expect them to take their time with reiho. A panic attack is no less debilitating than either of those things, and a hasty exit is an entirely reasonable and proportional response.\n\nIt is also like physical health in the sense that it is important to set reasonable expectations with people. That is, if you have a busted knee and can't seiza, then naturally that is a thing to discuss with sensei so that they know they aren't just blowing off sitting in seiza. So mental health challenges are similar. You don't need to be specific, if you're uncomfortable disclosing, just like you don't have to say that the specific reason you might have to run off the floor is because you have IBS, or whatever, but your instructor should be aware of your general limitations. It is not just politeness: if something bad should happen, then it is important for them to know how to help you. That could be how to navigate through a full blown panic attack just as it could be something like a fainting spell.\n\nA mental health issue is, in my view, nothing to feel better or worse about than a physical health issue.

Of course sparring is important, but that is not the question.\n\nI'm not taking about competitions. \n\nPartnered practice is so fundamental to kendo that when we just talk about \"practice\" or \"keiko\" it is understood to mean primarily partnered practice where we deliver full powered strikes to each other, whether structured as drills, or not (as sparring). Even in that case we practice reading our partner and judging the distance as they move and as we switch to partners of different ability. Practicing swinging without a partner is \"suburi,\" and an indication of it's status as a practice exercise in kendo is that at kendo camps, instructors frequently have to remind people not to treat it as a mere \"warm-up.\" Even all of our kata are partnered and judged by the timing and synchronization between the partners.\n\nAs others have said, swinging the shinai is not the core of what kendo is about. Thinking that kendo is about how to swing the shinai is like thinking that music is about how to play s chord on your cello. You cannot play music without playing your instrument, but there are miles and miles beyond that mechanistic detail.\n\n\n>If you lived in an area with out a Kendo instructor, you would opt to never buy or swing a shinai, instead of guided self-practice of Kendo Suburi? \n\nWell, this speaks directly to my background.\n\nI took up kendo as a teenager. When I went to college, I couldn't find a dojo, so I stopped practicing for several years, until I was able to find a group to practice with. Even so, we were all beginners, so I had to travel about 3 hours to the nearest \"real dojo,\" so I did that a few times a year.\n\nI have a side interest in using the short sword and the closest thing to sparring with that alone is tankendo. But there are no instructors or classes available to me. So, I don't practice that at all. I watch videos and matches when I can but I don't make any real practice of it because it's impossible.\n\nSo, personally, no, I do not try to practice these kinds of things without a dojo and at least some kind of access to an instructor. Combat arts require opponents. You can't be in combat without \"fighting\" with someone. Can you imagine learning to grapple without an opponent? Or to box? It's the same thing.\n\nThis is entirely separate from doing something with a sword that is not kendo. Like you can learn to cut without a partner. But that isn't kendo.", "created_utc": "1633806573.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hg0ib1b", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_q4crs6", "parent_id": "t1_hg0done", "score": "4", "subreddit": "kendo", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qo63"}, {"author": "hyart", "body": ">How does a single cellist know if they are good without an orchestra? Good is good.\n\nInstead of a cello, think about a violin. Concert violinists and bluegrass fiddlers can be simultaneously good at their genre and incompetent in the other, all on precisely the same instrument. Same with classical guitarists and rock guitarists. Or opera singers and metal singers. If you want to be good at both, you have to train at both.\n\n>Its about honing a skill. After time spent studying, will an experienced practitioner take notice to clean form and swings?\n\nThe issue is that there is more to kendo than swings. Same as there is more to playing an instrument than how to play a note. You can't be a good orchestra player without being able to read the conductor, no matter how good you are at your instrument. You can't be a good jazz player without being good at improvisation, regardless of how good you are at the instrument. Improvisation and reading the conductor are not transferable skills.\n\nAnyway, it goes back to the fundamental question: do you ever plan to play with a kendo player? If so, the quality of your strikes is not going to help you read your opponent and the distance, so no matter how good you are at swinging the shinai, you will be missing a key competency for playing kendo.\n\n\n>This is what I wonder. How many bad dojos are there out there? I couldn\u2019t imagine a smart person with a good source (book ir video) coming out with less results than a poor instructor could give.\n\nSo, again, the question I'm posing is not a \"smart\" vs \"not smart\" or \"good instructor\" vs \"poor instructor\" thing.\n\nNo amount of intelligence can tell you if you can score a point against an opponent. Nor can any instructor in isolation. The only way to know if you can score a kendo point against a kendo opponent is to actually try it and see what happens. That is why you must do kendo to improve at kendo. Not because the knowledge is somehow mysterious, but because you never know what you actually learned until you put it to the test. So even if you did manage to learn it all by yourself, *neither you nor anyone else would ever be able to know it* until you actually join a dojo. And, even if possible, the odds of being able to simply do that by yourself are miniscule.\n\nTo be clear, it's not anything magic about kendo. It's the same thing if you wanted to learn to do some Olympic sport. Yes, it's possible to figure it out on your own, but it is super duper rare and the Olympics are full of examples of just that.", "created_utc": "1633802304.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hg08r29", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_q4crs6", "parent_id": "t1_hg054js", "score": "2", "subreddit": "kendo", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qo63"}, {"author": "hyart", "body": "I think there is a lot you can learn by yourself.\n\nBut I'm not sure what the real question is here.\n\nIf you never practice with anyone else, then what does it mean to be \"good?\" To be \"better\" or \"worse\" means having to compare yourself to something and the only way you can have that is to regularly practice with someone. Not just sparring, either. How do you know if your kata is \"good\" or not?\n\nIf you literally only will ever practice with yourself then I don't think there is any good or bad. There's just whether or not you are getting what you want out of the activity. Who cares what anyone else thinks about it.\n\nIf the question is if you can teach yourself enough to be able to walk into a dojo in 1 year, 5 years, 10 years, whatever, and be \"good\" compared to the people who are there, then the answer is almost certainly that you cannot. The reason is that constantly practicing with others allows you to stay on track. If you only compare yourself to others once in a while, then you can go off course a long time before realizing it, and then you will have a long path to get back on track. Is it impossible? No, but the odds that you will just randomly happen to do everything the best way are vanishingly small. It does not mean that you are not good at whatever you are practicing. It is just that what you are practicing and the standards of what is going on in the new situation are almost certainly not going to be the same.\n\nI hope that makes sense.", "created_utc": "1633799127.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hg01gy5", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_q4crs6", "parent_id": "t3_q4crs6", "score": "4", "subreddit": "kendo", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qo63"}, {"author": "hyart", "body": "bull hitch might be less likely to come free. imo it looks nicer on a necklace as well\n\nhttps://youtu.be/5Chlmy0vRMs", "created_utc": "1633227611.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hf6c30q", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_q07gno", "parent_id": "t3_q07gno", "score": "14", "subreddit": "knots", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r57p"}, {"author": "hyart", "body": "i think it depends on whether you want soft supple skin or dry hard crusty calluses.", "created_utc": "1633134536.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hf1geaq", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_pzgrtb", "parent_id": "t1_hf1dee2", "score": "2", "subreddit": "kendo", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qo63"}, {"author": "hyart", "body": "Personally, I find rubbing alcohol helps dry the skin out and callous up.

It can be pinned either with your hand/finger or the bottom line can be pinned by the top line.

This isn't about skipping workouts because you are tired, it's more like completing the rep or pushing for the full ROM. The workout is only part of the story. A workout without enough rest and enough nutritional support is just a quarter squat.\n\nThe advice about needing to be disciplined is mostly about how you feel before your workout.

We are all in the same boat here and how you compare isn't really the important thing in kendo anyway.\n\nThat said, there's nothing wrong with trying to practice for yourself. Why not look for ways to practice?\n\nDistance has a couple of components.\n\nOne is the size of your fumikomi. If you have room to do that, then you can do things like put out something on the floor to check your distance. Or you can video yourself from the side and check your distance that way. Remember that you are aiming for control and posture, not just distance.\n\nAnother thing is the size of your okuriashi, like when you are moving in from to-ma to uchi-ma. Here again you can put something on the floor or use just video, but what I used to do when I fenced to practice point control was to hang a ball on a string. You can practice stepping in to where you just touch the ball. Again, the goal here is control. And you can practice making sure you are moving in straight so that the ball bounces straight back and not at an angle. Again, video yourself to double check you are not adjusting with your arms or by leaning.\n\nAnother component is your swing. Just video yourself doing suburi from the side. Aim for consistent correct movement with a nice full extension.\n\nTiming is hard because you can't practice that without a person, really. Practicing it with something like a moving target or shadow boxing is possible but I personally don't think it really accomplishes anything.\n\nInstead you can practice your balance and readiness to move. One way to do this is to put some time on a kitchen timer and practice your footwork while it counts down. Maneuver around. When the timer goes off, make fumikomi right away. Again, video yourself to get a clear idea of how long it took you to start your fumikomi after the timer went off and what weird contortions you had to do to adjust your balance before you could move.\n\nIf you are having video sessions then maybe your Sensei would be open to reviewing your videos as well.\n\nGood luck", "created_utc": "1585797092.0", "edited": "False", "id": "fm6lv6e", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_ftbr1r", "parent_id": "t3_ftbr1r", "score": "3", "subreddit": "kendo", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qo63"}, {"author": "hyart", "body": "Sorry to say, I don't know how the names came about.", "created_utc": "1585619579.0", "edited": "False", "id": "flzb5pv", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_frz6ef", "parent_id": "t1_flyls8p", "score": "1", "subreddit": "knots", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r57p"}, {"author": "hyart", "body": "\"Bowline on a bight\" is a specific knot: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowline_on_a_bight\n\nWhat you have there is what happens when you take a bight and then use it to tie a bowline, as you would tie one with a single line.

In the beginning it is hard to know where your max is, what your sleep requirements are, what kind of pain is dangerous and what kind is fine, and so on.\n\nCertainly using a program is a great help and they often make things safer for people.

Nor are they targeted at you in specific.\n\nThe issue, as I see it, is that hard kendo practice subjects your body to stressors that most people don't encounter. Naturally, because of that, they are not factored into the program.\n\nJust to take a simple example, and here I'm taking about general programming and not TB, poor form with both bench and ohp will pinch tendons in your shoulder. This is not a big deal for most people because it isn't like your shoulder is going to explode from that little irritation. It may not even hurt. But, it's still a repetitive/cumulative stain thing. So most people will have no issues with, for example, bench on Wed and ohp on Fri. The rest day on Thu is enough to recover from whatever irritation you got from your Wed workout. But this scenario changes if you add 1000 suburi on Thursday. Then whatever minor irritation you get on Wed may not get a chance to fully recover, this becomes a recipe for a future issue. So for us in specific, it might make more sense to always put, for example, a lower body day between upper body days, or a pull day between push days, or whatever else follows from your routine.\n\nSo it's not that TP, or any programming system in particular, is bad. Most of them are terrific. Its just that those systems were not designed with heavy kendo practice in mind. Good programming needs to be holistic and take into account your entire training regimen, not just the half in the gym. The same is true for your kendo practice. If you're a serious competitive athlete then your kendo training schedule should also reflect your whole situation and not just the half in the dojo. Like it doesn't make sense to do a deload in the gym but choose that week for extra heavy squad practice in the dojo.\n\nI hope this makes sense.", "created_utc": "1582986118.0", "edited": "False", "id": "fj3k8mh", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_fb37b6", "parent_id": "t1_fj3iiyl", "score": "2", "subreddit": "kendo", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qo63"}, {"author": "hyart", "body": "I believe that Tactical Barbell uses a normal powerlifting base set of exercises (squat, deadlift, bench press, overhead press). Please correct me if I'm wrong.\n\nThat's all great but if you are a beginner without a coach then there are some concerns here. Poor squat form will wreck your knees, poor deadlift form will wreck your lower back, and bad bench and press form will wreck your shoulders' ability to work overhead. All of those danger areas are places that kendo places high demand on.\n\nThis is not to say that they aren't great movements. They are, but if you are pushing hard in kendo then any problems in your form will get magnified by the stress in kendo.\n\nTo mitigate this, it is important to be super strict on form, to program carefully to avoid over-stressing yourself, and to make sure to get enough rest and nutrition for recovery. A great trainer should help you with all of these things, but if you're looking at a program from a book then probably you're not working with a trainer.\n\nIf the program allows, you could also use safer versions of these exercises. For example, dumbbell or swiss bar variations for bench and ohp, and trap bar deadlift.\n\nThis all assumes you're primarily interested in kendo and not boosting your powerlifting numbers.

But in general, for kendo, I would caution not to skimp out on unilateral exercises, dynamic core work, rotator cuff maintenance, and grip work.

It's a little confusing.\n\nI also don't know your specific situation, so the rest of this is rather generic.\n\nIn my opinion, if you want to practice hard, then you are better off spending time doing resistance training in the gym. And, the harder you want to practice, the more seriously you should take your gym time. This doesn't matter if you are big or small or heavy or light. It also doesn't matter if you are already (or naturally) athletic or not (well, except in the sense that if you're already athletic then you are more likely to already be doing this).\n\nWith every kind of physical exercise, it is possible to do more than what your body can handle. This isn't specific to kendo. If you try to play, say, competitive football (regardless of what sport you think that means :-)), without additional work in the gym, then you will be more prone to get injuries (e.g., ACL tears). This is even true of something that seems low impact, like hiking long distances. The less trained your ankles are, the more likely you will be to sprain one when tripping over a rock or a root or when slipping on a slippery surface.\n\nEspecially when playing any kind of competitive sport, it is easy to accidentally exceed what you body can handle in the heat of the moment. However, you can systematically and safely increase the limits of what your joints and other connective tissues are able to handle in the gym. That way you can safely prepare your body for high effort movements and get both less risk of major injury and better resilience to general wear and tear.\n\nThis really just comes down to two things:\n\n1. know your limits\n2. know what your goals are\n\nTo avoid injuries, you need to stay within your limits. If your limits are too low for your goals, then you need to take steps to increase those limits.\n\nSince you brought up time, I would like to be clear that this isn't even just about having time to spend in the gym. It's much more than that. Your ability to recover (and so to reduce the onset and effects of arthrosis and repetitive strain injuries) is also related to your diet and, super super importantly, how much sleep you get. So you not only need to budget time for the gym, you also need to make sure you allow enough rest time and enough time to prepare enough healthy and nutritious food to support your training goals.\n\nFrom my experience in particular, I would say that specifically for kendo, there are several things that are important to pay attention to in addition to the stability of your knee joints. I would add to that strengthening your rotator cuff (shoulder), and also addressing imbalances between the two sides of your body.\n\nEDIT: source: am almost 50, BMI 24, practicing kendo for about half my life, have torn cartilage and arthrosis in both knees and (at least) one shoulder  :-p", "created_utc": "1580572475.0", "edited": "1580572964.0", "id": "fg6nfqm", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_ewydii", "parent_id": "t3_ewydii", "score": "4", "subreddit": "kendo", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qo63"}, {"author": "hyart", "body": "I don't think it's a special procedure, it seems commonly described on YouTube.

Gradings back then never came up and I never asked. This was in a regular federation dojo. I don't know why it never came up, but I never asked about it and I was very happy not caring about it. Testing and tournaments always stressed me out in the other martial arts my mom made me practice when I was younger (karate, tae kwon do), so I was more than happy not having anyone push me about it. It's one reason I stuck with kendo instead of bailing out like I did with the other things. A big part of the issue is that I suffer from anxiety disorders and it's super difficult for me to perform well when I think there is an audience. Anyway, point is that I practiced 3 years then and didn't have any rank, and I have no idea what my rank would have been if I did test.\n\nWhen I was 18, I went away to college, but I couldn't find anywhere to practice until I was 22 or 23 or so. At that club there were no sensei. I would go to proper dojo a couple of times a year to practice, but other than that we just practiced amongst ourselves. The club varied in size because it was a college town. Some summers it was literally 3 people. I don't think it was ever more than like maybe 12-ish? Something like that. Anyway, I made it up to 3-dan practicing there, and it took, I dunno, like 7 years or something. I never passed any test on the first try. Most of that time I was 1 level lower than the highest other person at the club, and I practiced at a proper dojo only maybe 3-5 times a year or so.\n\nSome time after that I had to move to a big city for work with lots of local kendo. So, yay. It still took me until 2007 to get 4-dan, which was another 6-7 years. I had to re-invent both the way I practice and the way I played in order to get it. My previous understanding and my method for progressing gave me a reasonable theoretical/technical understanding, but my experience struggling to make 4-dan really hammered home the idea that kendo is *so much more* than technique, and I missed out on most of those lessons getting to 4-dan.\n\nWell, I'm still 4-dan. and now it's been 12 years, so I'm way, way overdue. It's been a couple of years since I last attempted it. I don't get enough time to practice, and my physical condition has been an issue lately. For example, I've torn the cartilage in both knees (meniscii) and my right shoulder (labrum) over the past 2 years. At this point, I probably failed 5-dan at least 5 times by now.

The strength gains don't translate well. So it's a great exercise and worth incorporating in a strength program, but not as something to directly improve your kendo performance. By comparison, a unilateral movement like a Bulgarian split squat or a step through landmine snatch has much better specificity. But, on the other hand, being more specific means that it isn't as good for developing general fitness. Similarly, deep squats are best for developing lower body fitness, but, aside from sonkyo, we don't use that range of motion in kendo. So the extra muscle you have from training the full RoM is just extra mass to weigh you down. Even just parallel is more than we need for kendo. But nobody is going to advise you to just stick to half-squats.\n\nAt the end of the day, my opinion is it is best to use a general fitness routine for general health, incorporate plenty of metabolic training like HIIT or sprints, and don't bother trying to make it kendo specific unless you're on your way to becoming a pro.\n\nIf anything, if you're not a pro, then it's probably better for your long term health to specifically _not_ train kendo stuff in the gym in order to counteract some of the muscle imbalances that would otherwise develop.\n\nIf you are into powerlifting or weightlifting, then, by all means, train those movements for the requirements of those sports.\n\nBut if you want to have a stronger fumikomi you'd be better off just spending the time doing fumikomi.\n\nJust my opinion.", "created_utc": "1559539234.0", "edited": "False", "id": "epvlx8a", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_bw1tk8", "parent_id": "t3_bw1tk8", "score": "5", "subreddit": "kendo", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qo63"}, {"author": "hyart", "body": "I use a 2 stand Matthew Walker knot on my rope darts.

I meant it in the literal sense. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd I didn't say that the calves don't contribute. As you said, it's a compound movement. I'm arguing with the statements that \"power comes from your calves and \\*not\\* from the glutes\" (emphasis added) and \"there is very little hip extension.\" The calves are key, I don't dispute that at all. But to say that the glutes are not also significantly involved is not correct.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCalves need to be very powerful even if they did not contribute to forward movement because you have an ankle and a raised heel. The calves must keep the ankle rigid or else you can't transmit any power through the kinetic chain. All contribution to forward movement is bonus. This is different from, say, western fencing, where the heel is planted.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you're saying that there is no significant glute contribution because your thigh is already close to maximally extended, so there is no range of motion remaining for it to travel, then I would understand your argument. But I would then say that your kamae is off, because it shouldn't be that far extended.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe calf muscle -- the gastroc, specifically -- has two functions: plantar flexion and knee flexion. Since we're talking about straight leg, there's no knee flexion to speak of. So if you're talking about power from the calf, there is only one joint for it left to act on -- the ankle. That's why I'm saying that your saying that power is from the calf is equivalent to saying that it's from the ankle, from plantar flexion. That's it's only remaining function.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut, as I said, this is all trivially demonstrable. You don't have to believe me. Just try it. You can't fumikomi without significant hip extension. You mentioned about how \"they say\" we move from the hip meaning we don't break our posture. What does that mean, biomechanically speaking? It means that the hips move forward without our upper body leaning forward. That is only possible with hip extension.

Thank you for that.\n\nI'm not a doctor or expert in any relevant field, so no one should take my comments on this stuff as authoritative. It's all just my opinion based on my own personal experience, my own reading of studies and other educational materials, and my own interpretations of things.\n\nMoreover, I think brain injuries are no joke and people are justified to be concerned and take steps to protect themselves. Unfortunately, your sensei, coach, peers, etc, cannot tell what is going on inside of your head, so it is up to every one of us to be aware of the symptoms of brain injuries and to take steps both to protect ourselves and to foster a safe practice environment for everyone.\n\nOk, that said.\n\nPlease note the description of the mechanics of a concussion in the Ted talk that you posted. It's at about 38 seconds in: https://youtu.be/xvjK-4NXRsM?t=37s\n\nThis matches the understanding that I've had about concussions. Notice that the issue is about the shifting of the brain inside of the skull. This happens because the brain floats inside the skull and is not really attached, so, inertia can cause the brain to bump into the skull, or the skull to bump into the brain. But, for this to happen, there has to be a sudden change of direction.\n\nNow, think about what happens when you receive men. There is, normally, no such change of direction when you receive men. Neither the direction nor the magnitude of the strike, typically, has any meaningful effect on your head's movement or position. So it is difficult to see where the concussion risk comes from when receiving men.\n\nThis is quite different from heading a ball.\n\nThat is not to say that there is no possibility for injury when receiving men. For example:\n\n> Occasionally, a blow to the head may be severe enough to cause\n> bleeding in or around the brain. This type of bleeding can cause\n> an intracranial hematoma, a serious condition that puts pressure\n> on the brain.\n\nFrom: https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/intracranial-hematoma/expert-answers/head-injury/faq-20058442\n\nIn: https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2016/01/06/462138708/how-a-simple-bump-can-cause-an-insidious-brain-injury\n\nwhich is about a brain injury from a bump on the head, the comment is made:\n\n> A subdural hematoma is [...] different from the usual football\n> concussions, in which blows to the head damage the brain's\n> electrical wiring.\n\nIt is not that there is no danger. However, it is important when reading all of this stuff that you be clear about what the danger actually is in order to properly interpret what you are reading. Only that way can you come up with a good assessment of the risks.\n\nIt implies, for example, that tai-atari carries a risk of subconcussive damage. Note, for example:\n\n> Subconcussive hits are those that are below that concussion\n> threshold: the brain is shaken, but not so violently that the\n> damage to brain cells is severe enough to see through symptoms.\n>\n> Examples of these types of impacts include most tackles and\n> collisions on the football field; headers in soccer; checks or\n> collisions with the boards or other players in ice hockey; and\n> body checks in lacrosse. The impacts are there, and the brain\n> is affected, we just don\u2019t notice it right away.\n\nFrom: https://concussionfoundation.org/CTE-resources/subconcussive-impacts\n\nTai-atari is very similar to a body check or board collision. IMO it is much more similar than heading a ball is to receiving men (unless you are in the practice of jumping and throwing your head forward to receive the strike :-p)\n\nAlso, someone who is older or has a bleeding disorder is in far more danger of a brain injury from a hematoma.\n\nIn my lay opinion, the risk from concussion (and subconcussive strikes) in kendo does not come from receiving men. It primarily comes from the risk of falling, getting knocked into walls, and excessively strong tai-atari. There is a relatively small secondary risk that comes from improper technique, like getting punched in the men-gane, and super aggressive tsuki, especially mukae-zuki. The only reason I consider those \"relatively small\" risks is that those are improper technique, and so you have to take into account your dojo.\n\nAgain, that is not to say that there is no danger from receiving men that is too strong. I think the risk there is primarily a contusion causing intra-cranial bleeding. That is not a well studied or quantified risk.\n\nAgain, take all of that with a pound of salt. I'm not a doctor or expert in any relevant field. It's my own personal opinion.\n\nI don't know how it is in your dojo. Where I practice, there is a lot of emphasis placed on posture. I would agree that in many dojo I have been that there is a traditional emphasis on toughing things out, and so people are very often reluctant to acknowledge injuries. Not just head injuries, but all injuries. It's counterproductive and dangerous, and I think there is reason to try to change that part of the culture. I've seen a lot of change in this area over the past 10 years or so.\n\nAs for the men pad thing: the way I have always taught people to wear the men is to think of it like a hard hat. The menbuton is not very thick and a traditionally high quality one is rock hard, not cushion-y at all. If you have that sitting right on top of your head, there is no way that it's not going to hurt when someone hits you. However, these things are like hard hats -- a very hard surface that is suspended over your delicate flesh. When I tie my men, I can fit a pencil between my scalp and the men. The tightness of the men himo and the hardness of the menbuton creates an arch that turns all of the space into a cushion without the need for a pad. A worn-out men or one that is not tied tightly enough cannot hold its shape like that, so the cushion is compromised, and then it hurts when you get hit. But, as far as I'm concerned, a men pad is only called for if the men doesn't fit you or if it is worn out. If the men fits properly and is in good condition, then the problem, in my experience, is that it isn't tied tightly enough.\n\nAgain, I'm no expert. These are all my opinions only. People need to take the initiative to manage their own safety when it comes to health and injury, because nobody knows how it feels inside your body, and, ultimately, it's going to be you who pays the price.\n\nAnd, thank you again for your very fair assessments.\n\nEDIT: small clarifications", "created_utc": "1520953127.0", "edited": "False", "id": "dvmqbj3", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_8299cz", "parent_id": "t1_dvlmb5w", "score": "2", "subreddit": "kendo", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qo63"}, {"author": "hyart", "body": "I don't think I've ever seen anyone argue specifically for a bowline over some more specific knot for some given purpose, except maybe when speed is a factor, so I don't really think that the bowline is really so \"loved\" or anything.\n\nIt's a versatile knot that is easy to tie, reliably easy to untie, is reasonably secure, and is very well understood in terms of what it's good at and what it's not.

It also doesn't really say anything about prevalence, and so it doesn't really say anything about how likely it is that you will sustain an injury.\n\nThe second paper talks about \"repetitive mild traumatic brain injury,\" and, there, it is important to be clear about what that means. It isn't defined in the paper. The ACRM (American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine) gives this definition:\n\n> A patient with mild traumatic brain injury is a person who has had a traumatically induced physiological disruption of brain function, as manifested by at least one of the following:\n>\n> 1. any period of loss of consciousness;\n> 2. any loss of memory for events immediately before or after the accident;\n> 3. any alteration in mental state at the time of the accident (eg, feeling dazed, disoriented, or confused); and\n> 4. focal neurological deficit(s) that may or may not be transient; but where the severity of the injury does not exceed the following:\n>\n> * loss of consciousness of approximately 30 minutes or less;\n> * after 30 minutes, an initial Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) of 13\u201315; and\n> * posttraumatic amnesia (PTA) not greater than 24 hours.\n\n(see: https://acrm.org/wp-content/uploads/pdf/TBIDef_English_10-10.pdf )\n\nNow, I don't know if that is the correct definition for the purpose of that paper, but it's the typical one, and so if that is the right definition then it means the paper is talking about something quite different from what we typically experience during kendo practice.\n\nI do think it is worth being concerned about, and I keep an eye out for information about it, and I do my best to protect both myself and the people I practice with safe.

Because both are under tension, they push each other into the top half of the knot. That pushing creates friction between the two halves of the knot, which is what keeps it from pulling out. Each end in the the knot gets squeezed in the bight that it's sitting in. In sufficiently slippery line, that pushing doesn't create enough friction in the knot, and, in fact, it can just pull out. Similarly, if you pull on one standing end and one working end, you'll see the knot deform. If you left it loose, you'll see it slip.

That's just saying that you adapt to different situations.\n\nThe question of spirit is if you treat a match with a mu-kyu as seriously as with an 8-dan. Not when you're being motodachi but if you were actually doing shiai or jigeiko or something. When you face your opponent, does your level of intensity and engagement depend on who they are?\n\nIn my experience, most people do not approach the match with equal focus, intensity, and seriousness. But I think they probably should. In the spirit of shinken shobu, that beginner can cut you and kill you, so you shouldn't be taking it any more lightly than any other fight. In the spirit of ichi-go-ichi-e, I think you should treat each meeting as though it is your first, and will be your last. \n\nJust to reiterate, seriousness is not how hard you tai-atari or anything like that. Think about playing an 80 year old 8-dan. You aren't going to try to smash that sensei into the wall, but you had better take the match seriously. Compare with playing a 3-kyu that is twice your weight and built like a linebacker. That's a person that will take whatever you dish out at them, physically, but you have to ask yourself truthfully, when you make seme-ai with them, will you hold the same spirit as when playing with a fit sensei?\n\nI think that, at the very least for the shodachi, you really should.\n\nI myself am not at the level that I can play everyone with the same intensity and seriousness, but it is something that I'm working towards. \n\n\n\n", "created_utc": "1494469318.0", "edited": "False", "id": "dhek73q", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_6a8ir2", "parent_id": "t3_6a8ir2", "score": "1", "subreddit": "kendo", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qo63"}, {"author": "hyart", "body": "Although I agree with the other comments, I think just saying \"thinking\" is confusing.\n\nOften people consider \"thinking\" as concentrating and having a sort of internal conversation.

It's distracting and removes you from being present in the moment. When people talk about mushin, or \"no mind,\" they are taking about getting rid of that kind of thinking.\n\nConsider having a real conversation with someone. Of course, you're thinking all the time. You're listening, considering what was said, and making a thoughtful response. But you aren't having some conversation with yourself, in your head, at the same time. If you try, you can't pay attention to the other person, and the conversation won't work. You'll miss what they said and lose the opportunity to make a good response.\n\nThis is the same as how the match works.\n\nIf you've ever tried to learn a foreign language, you'll know that you also can't try to have a conversation while trying to conjugate verbs and figure out grammar. You have to practice those things during practice time, and then in a conversion, you have to do the best you can with what you've got. You'll make mistakes, but you and your conversational partner will muddle through it. If you're paying attention to the conversation, then you will pick up on when what you're trying to express isn't getting through, or when you've misunderstood something thought you understood. Based on that, you'll practice on his not to make those mistakes again.\n\nI think this is also how practice works. \n\nSo, yes, you think, but it's not the kind of analytical thinking that distracts from your opponent or pulls you out of the moment. It's the kind of thinking that brings you into the match and into the moment.\n\nThat's not to say you should never have those kinds of analytical self conversations during a match (conversation).

You are fighting with your opponent to take control of the line of attack as you move to your hitting distance. If you establish control over the center line at the same time that you reach a stable posture at your hitting distance, then you will be able to immediately launch an effective attack. If this happens at a moment of weakness for your opponent, then you will be able to hit.\n\ntsuba-zeriai is exactly the same. You want to find a way to be stable and balanced, so you can strike with ki-ken-tai, at a distance where you can hit with the proper part of the shinai, with control over the line that the shinai will have to travel on to hit, and at a time when your opponent is vulnerable. If you can do all that, then you will be able to make ippon.\n\nThe difference is only one of technique. Just as your distance and footwork for hitting kote is different from hitting men, your distance and footwork for hitting hiki-men is different from hitting tobikomi-men.\n\nOf course, that is what you're trying to do, and it's easier said than done. So as a beginner you focus on parts of the thing. Maybe you don't worry so much about getting the timing right with regard to your opponent's state, and you just worry about taking center and getting to distance. That's fine. Practice what you need to practice.\n\nIn the end I think it is best to think of tsuba-zeriai as just a different kamae. \n\nOften at practice people just separate, but it is very often just laziness. Certainly that is the case for me when i practice with someone my level of lower. Sometimes I want to practice something specific, and then spending the time and energy fighting \"for real\" in tsuba-zeriai feels like a distraction and a waste of time, because it is time not practicing the waza I want to practice. But the reality is that blowing off the opportunity to practice making openings in tsuba-zeriai and instead practicing walking backwards is the actual waste of time, so really when I do that, then I am actually being selfish and lazy.\n\n\n\n\n\n", "created_utc": "1461989805.0", "edited": "False", "id": "d2n06jb", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_4gy98i", "parent_id": "t3_4gy98i", "score": "4", "subreddit": "kendo", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qo63"}, {"author": "hyart", "body": "Shiai is not a priority at KZ.", "created_utc": "1461710529.0", "edited": "False", "id": "d2ikl27", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_4gji7o", "parent_id": "t1_d2ij094", "score": "3", "subreddit": "kendo", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qo63"}, {"author": "hyart", "body": "morote, during kihon, everyone does it.\nwe only practice it occasionally.

Try doing this with the left hand in different positions and with the hips at different angles. Try to feel where the shinai is best supported.\n\n* Emphasize pushing from the back with a quick and sharp hikitsuke by stepping to a count. Ooooooooooooooooone-two! Ooooooooooooooooone-two!\n\nHere are a few for suburi:\n\n* Help cue not to overswing by holding a shinai to prevent swinging back past 45 deg.\n\n* Help cue use of major chest and back muscle groups instead of deltoids by reminding to pinch shoulder blades. Perhaps put a hand between the shoulder blades.\n\n* Help cue left hand extension by placing a target (open palm) in front of the student. Instruct the student to hit the open palm with their left hand. If you have them hit forcefully it can help cue use of the lats.\n\nI dunno, there are sooo many tricks like this that it is hard to think of them without actually watching a beginner... I do a lot of things purely in response to how I see them behave and according to their background.\n\nedit:formatting.", "created_utc": "1454546738.0", "edited": "False", "id": "czmzei9", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_43txrg", "parent_id": "t3_43txrg", "score": "3", "subreddit": "kendo", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qo63"}, {"author": "hyart", "body": "It's harder technically, and also harder to get open, and also harder to judge well.", "created_utc": "1450494687.0", "edited": "False", "id": "cy454um", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_3xbz9c", "parent_id": "t1_cy3u9f9", "score": "1", "subreddit": "kendo", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qo63"}, {"author": "hyart", "body": "I think the problem with horizontal cuts is that it is very difficult to get the angle right and have good tenouchi with two hands on the weapon.
