His position was that converts should be making a choice between being Catholic or Jewish and not trying to be both.  \n\nThis view prevailed throughout the history of the Church.  The movement for \"Hebrew Catholics\" who incorporate Jewish customs into Catholicism is a fairly recent phenomenon.  I do not see it as well grounded in terms of theology and it has not been tried by time.\n\nIf there are any converts from Judaism considering such practices, I recommend that they seek spiritual direction.  They need to avoid the danger of seeing these things as salvific (mentioned in the video) and also the dangers of using it as a way to make oneself \"special\" or to attract attention.  A spiritual director could help with their understanding of Church teaching and with self knowledge about their motives.\n\nOne of the things that I appreciate about Roy Shoeman is his clarity around the importance of praying for the conversion of Jews.

An excerpt:\n\n>The question arises:  Why has the implementation of the Council, in large parts of the Church, thus far been so difficult?  \n>  \n>Well, it all depends on the correct interpretation of the Council or - as we would say today - on its proper hermeneutics, the correct key to its interpretation and application. The problems in its implementation arose from the fact that two contrary hermeneutics came face to face and quarrelled with each other. One caused confusion, the other, silently but more and more visibly, bore and is bearing fruit.  \n>  \n>On the one hand, there is an interpretation that I would call \"a hermeneutic of discontinuity and rupture\"; it has frequently availed itself of the sympathies of the mass media, and also one trend of modern theology. On the other, there is the \"hermeneutic of reform\", of renewal in the continuity of the one subject-Church which the Lord has given to us. She is a subject which increases in time and develops, yet always remaining the same, the one subject of the journeying People of God.  \n>  \n>The hermeneutic of discontinuity risks ending in a split between the pre-conciliar Church and the post-conciliar Church. It asserts that the texts of the Council as such do not yet express the true spirit of the Council. It claims that they are the result of compromises in which, to reach unanimity, it was found necessary to keep and reconfirm many old things that are now pointless. However, the true spirit of the Council is not to be found in these compromises but instead in the impulses toward the new that are contained in the texts.\n\nFor those considering the questions raised by the OP, I recommend reading all of the document starting from \"The last event of this year on which I wish to reflect here is the celebration of the conclusion of the Second Vatican Council 40 years ago.\"  I find it is an excellent starting point.", "created_utc": "1661437837.0", "edited": "1661440140.0", "id": "ilqkmon", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_wxek9f", "parent_id": "t3_wxek9f", "score": "7", "subreddit": "Catholicism", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qi4f"}, {"author": "JayneKulik", "body": "I have *Theology for Beginners*.

He stressed the necessity of emancipation. Confederate diplomat Ambrose Dudley Mann met with the pope in December 1863 and received a letter addressed to the \"Honorable President of the Confederate States of America.\" This was simple courtesy, though it had no legal effect. The Confederacy used it in propaganda to claim papal support. For example, Robert E. Lee called the pope \"the only sovereign... in Europe who recognized our poor Confederacy\".\\[9\\] In fact, no diplomatic relations or recognitions were extended in either direction. In his dispatch to Richmond, Mann claimed a great diplomatic achievement for himself; he believed the letter was \"a positive recognition of our Government\". Confederate Secretary of State Judah P. Benjamin told Mann it was \"a mere inferential recognition, unconnected with political action or the regular establishment of diplomatic relations\" and thus did not assign it the weight of formal recognition.\\[10\\]\\[11\\]\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope\\_Pius\\_IX\\_and\\_the\\_United\\_States", "created_utc": "1660858141.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ikum3x5", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_wruhot", "parent_id": "t3_wruhot", "score": "24", "subreddit": "Catholicism", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qi4f"}, {"author": "JayneKulik", "body": "If you are interested in this topic, I recommend Fr.

So I don't like Democrats or Republicans and I don't have a side on this.  But my teenage son went on a school trip to Washington a few months ago so I related to the situation.  I looked into it a lot and this is my perspective.\n\nMy son went to Washington with his American History class.  He bought a Trump Putin 2020 hat from a souvenir stand.  Most of his classmates bought MAGA hats or variations because apparently this is a cool souvenir.  My son's hat does not represent his political views although it does give some idea as to his sense of humour.  I just can't believe that wearing that hat means the wearer is racist, especially not when the person is a teenager.\n\nMy son tells me that the \"it's not rape if you enjoy it\" line is common among teens and is supposed to be edgy/ironic.  Yes, it's inappropriate.  People who expect teenagers to be appropriate are likely to be disappointed.  Anyhow, the kid who said that does not go to Covington (confirmed by the investigation) so it is not relevant.\n\nThe initial viral video was dishonest and the professional journalists who accepted it without investigation acted without integrity.  It was obvious from looking at more footage that the boys were not guilty of anything they were accused of at first.  Nathan Phillips kept changing his story and should not have been treated as a reliable source of information.  The kids did not block him or surround him.  He approached them and inserted himself into their group.  He had his own supporters behind him and could have backed up.  There was also room for him to go around the kid.  Also Nick Sandmann's \"smirk\" did not actually reveal his thoughts.  Every single thing written about his facial expression was made up by its author.\n\nThe \"blackface\" at basketball game picture that was circulated to prove racism does not consider historical context.   That picture was taken in 2011.  In 2008 New York Times and Sports Illustrated were treating \"blackout\" and \"whiteout\" as appropriate fan behaviour.  [https://www.si.com/more-sports/photos/2008/09/29-0superfans-blackout-vs.-white-out#1](https://www.si.com/more-sports/photos/2008/09/29-0superfans-blackout-vs.-white-out#1)\n\n[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/05/sports/ncaafootball/05blackout.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/05/sports/ncaafootball/05blackout.html)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOver the following decade, blackout fan events became controversial due to the perceived resemblance to blackface and more and more schools discontinued them.  Including Covington.  The current students have not participated in one.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe investigation's conclusion that there is no evidence of \"racist or offensive statements\" ignores the fact that \"tomahawk chops\" are offensive.  Even at sports events this gesture is controversial.  Minimal investigation into Indigenous peoples' views on this matter is enough to discover that it is highly offensive.  Even if it were excusable as a greeting for sports teams with Native names/mascots (a matter under debate), there is no way it is appropriate for greeting actual Indigenous people.  While it is typical for teens to make inappropriate choices, it would be nice to see them receive some education on the Indigenous perspective on these issues.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHowever, the initial attacks on the boys were so over-the-top and so completely unjustified that I would not be surprised if it has left anyone sympathetic to the boys closed to considering their faults in the matter.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;", "created_utc": "1550181682.0", "edited": "False", "id": "eghkw70", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_aq9t7z", "parent_id": "t3_aq9t7z", "score": "1", "subreddit": "Kentucky", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qo41"}, {"author": "JayneKulik", "body": "I don't know the origin of the expression but I can explain why it sometimes is pronounced \"hwaiting\" and sometimes \"piting\".\n\nThe letter \u201cf\u201d in English represents a labial fricative.
