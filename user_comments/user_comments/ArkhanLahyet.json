For example, there's that English poem \"The Chaos\" that's about English spelling being very irregular.\n\nIt's only natural, because your native language is the one you know best, so people are unfamiliar with the troubles of learning other languages. Multiple times I've heard people say that English is easier than Spanish because the grammar is easier, but they wouldn't be saying that if they tried to compare reading the Lord of the Rings to Don Quixote.\n\nTo me, a big part of it is that Brazilians look at languages like English and see that it lacks grammatical features that make Portuguese difficult, so they (incorrectly) assume that other languages are easier. It's part of the reason why people think that Latin is super difficult to learn, since everything conjugates more. But it's important to remember that different languages are \"complicated\" in different ways; I think it comes down to lack of familiarity with other languages, and that makes you miss the other ways in which language can be complicated. For example, some English words change stress when they're a verb vs. when they're a noun (ex.: **per**mit / per**mit**, **pre**sent / pre**sent**).\n\nFurthermore, the distance between the formal and casual forms of the language varies a lot, but that's not really an indication of which languages are difficult. It may be noticeable in Portuguese, but it's probably much, much larger in Arabic and Japanese and plenty others.\n\nIt might have a bit to do with people in Brazil wanting to think they're unfortunate to have to learn the language.

It's got a similar feeling as to when people share bad statistics of their own country as a way to point out that things need to change.\n\nIn short, I don't think people would be using these points as reasons why Portuguese is hard if they were more familiar themselves with other languages.

That's similar to how a huge proportion of English vocabulary is of Latin origin, but you find few of them among the most commonly used English words. In both cases, the foreign words were introduced to the formal register of each language because more educated people were more likely to be in contact with the common language of the time, in which more \"refined\" literature and research was written.\n\nHowever, borrowing (loanwords) isn't restricted just to the formal register, but depends on historical context; like how a lot of vocabulary we use in classical music is of Italian origin and our names for cooked meats are from French while a lot of more scientific terms are of Latin origin because Latin was used for scientific publications for a long time.

So I decided to open the corners to see how they're built and see if I could fix them.\n\nYou can open the corners by pushing on its little tabs with a flathead screwdriver, but I recommend using a plastic tool to avoid damaging the pieces.

Wall of text warning.\n\n## Tornado V2 M\n\nThe good:\n- Feels nice to turn, very smooth and very fast out of the box. It actually feels reasonably close to a gan cube, but not as flexible and much quieter.\n- Really good colors, they\u2019re deep yet vibrant. This cube has my favorite color scheme so far, tied with the Aosu WR M.\n- The adjustable magnets are implemented much better than on the Weilong wrm 2021 (you know, the one with the tiny tool that breaks). Here, you can turn in either direction, the capsules are easier to turn and there\u2019s a wider range of magnet strengths.\n- I\u2019ve seen some people say that the caps come off easily, but they must\u2019ve changed something because I can\u2019t open mine with my fingers for the life of me. They\u2019re not coming off on their own.\n- I like that both settings of the dual adjustment system are changed with the same tool. Would be nicer if it was adjustable by hand or with a standard tool like a screwdriver, but the included tool is of a good quality (i.e. not just a piece of plastic) so I have no problems with that.\n\nThe bad:\n- The reverse corner cutting is, in fact, bad, even on the loosest settings. Actually, it\u2019s not *that* bad, but it\u2019s worse than the other cubes of today, and that to me makes it harder to recommend since it\u2019s going to catch more than other cubes no matter what.\n- This isn\u2019t really a \u201cbad\u201d point per se but I think the Tengyun V1 is just better as a quiet cube. They make more or less the same amount of noise, but the Tengyun makes a softer, lower-pitched noise that\u2019s easier on the ears.\n- The included bag comes folded twice and has a crease in the middle :(\n\nThe weird:\n- The adjustment tool includes two philips tips, even though they\u2019re not used anywhere for setting up the cube. Would\u2019ve made more sense to have the flat bit on one end and the 2-pronged fork on the other to avoid switching tips.\n- It takes a lot of lube to make this cube more controllable, it just refuses to be slow. I think it has to do with most of the pressure between pieces being near the core, so it\u2019s similar to the Tengyun in that regard. That\u2019s probably why this cube is quiet, too.\n- The cursive Chinese printed on the box says \u98a8\u4e8c\u4ee3 (second generation wind ...?)\n\n\nI got this cube on a sale, not really expecting to like it much because of the poor corner cutting, since I know I like flexible cubes like the Weilongs. The cube felt very blocky even at the loosest settings. But actually, I think a part of the problem is that the cube is too fast out of the box for how inflexible it is, so I increased the spring tension all the way to 5 and added some slow lube and it\u2019s not that bad now that it\u2019s more controllable. I think the cube is best when slow to minimize overturns.\n\nOverall, the corner cutting is the only fault in this cube. I like the colors, the feel, the surface finish, the size, the adjustment system, even the logo is nice. It\u2019s just that in terms of performance, it\u2019s hard to recommend it over other cubes since finding a setup that works well is like trying to work around the corner cutting issue, making it a cube that *can* be fast but it\u2019s hard to use. I still lock up in some places where other cubes wouldn\u2019t, but I can see some people maining the Tornado precisely because it\u2019s so stable.\n\n## Gan 354 V2 M\n\nThe good:\n- As always, this Gan cube came out of the box without a single scratch. Thumbs up.\n- The cube turns as well as expected. It\u2019s got the characteristic crunchy yet smooth feel of Gan cubes.\n- It\u2019s got an all plastic core, so no worries about using water-based lube.\n\nThe bad:\n- There\u2019s a ticking magnet. I didn\u2019t think that happened on Gan cubes, but apparently it does. Fortunately, the ticking sound is barely audible when solving, it\u2019s not nearly as loud as the ticking magnet I got with my RS3M, but probably harder to fix.\n- Man, the matte finish feels so slippery out of the box, every time.\n- I think the problems with Gan cubes mainly stem from bad design rather than construction, and it\u2019s no different here with the springs only allowing 0.6 and 0.8 travel distance. That feels like a step back from the V1\u2019s threaded nuts, as both options are too loose for the pre-installed purple springs. I could understand it if different springs had different options (e.g. 0.3 and 0.5 for purple, 0.4 and 0.6 for blue and so on), but no. I\u2019m glad the current flagships use something better. This system just appears to be intentionally restrictive, and I think there\u2019s a good chance that it actually is on purpose.\n\nThe weird:\n- Comparing with my Gan RS that I magnetized, the cap design on the 354 V2 is older, the same as the V1. Which is fine, but doesn\u2019t click in place as firmly.\n- The logo looks like a painted layer over the surface that doesn\u2019t shine with the background, which is different from the RS where the logo looks like part of the plastic. I would\u2019ve expected the cheaper RS to use a cheaper logo instead, but it\u2019s probably just using a more recent manufacturing process than the 354.\n- The edge magnets are inlaid deeper than the V1. But they still look nice.\n\n\nThe cube itself is very good, really looks and feels like a successor to the V1, including the uneven edges and corners and its \u201cpointier shape\u201d (the cube\u2019s edges are sharper than most cubes).\nHowever, the purple springs are way too loose and flimsy out of the box. They didn\u2019t have to be bad, but because 0.6 and 0.8 are the only options for every spring, it\u2019s very much necessary to get the version of this cube that comes with extra springs.\n\nI tried out each set of springs and settled for green, though I think yellow is a good pick too because of the strong-ish magnets. I get the impression that the cube is less stable than my 56mm RS, maybe because it\u2019s smaller while the springs are the same size. I think it\u2019s more likely to be just a difference with lubes and it not being broken in yet.\n\nThe cube is still a bit scratchy because it\u2019s new, but aside from that it feels like a perfectly standard Gan cube. It\u2019s a worthy successor to the Gan 354 V1, I only don\u2019t consider it a strict upgrade because the adjustment system is more restrictive.\n\n## Bonus: Gan RS\n\nI have a Gan RS that I magnetized with 4x2mm N42 magnets, and I never liked it much. I think the pre-installed yellow springs matched the cube well originally, but after the magnetization it became slow and catchy. Half of the reason why I got the 354V2 was to get extra springs for it too, and now that I replaced its springs with blue ones, I understand that the magnets I used were way too weak for the spring strength; now the catches are gone and this may be one of my favorite cubes.\n\nThe stock Gan RS is not a cube I recommend overall, but it\u2019s actually pretty good if you get magnets and extra springs, but then if you\u2019re going to go that far it\u2019s better to just get a 356M to begin with. Well, actually, one advantage of magnetizing a cube yourself is that you won\u2019t get ticking magnets like in my 354V2, so there\u2019s that. Just remember to pick strong magnets.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nSo, there\u2019s three cubes that weren\u2019t good out of the box for different reasons, and for different reasons they got better.

Mostly, I really like how 56mm feels, it just fits.\n* Magnets are definitely stronger but it doesn't actually make that much of a difference in my opinion.\n* I've seen people say that the 5x5 is too small, and I can see why. Somehow the outer layers feel tiny, even though they're just 1mm smaller than the MGC (about 12.5mm compared to about 13.5mm on the MGC5, \\~9% smaller). Might be because I'm used to the Meilong 5, which is smaller but its outer layers are the same size as the MGC.\n* Despite not being as comfortable on the 5x5 as on the 4x4, I quite like it and I hope I can get used to the cube. However, it doesn't really enable 3x3 fingertricks like the Zhilong 4x4 does, so in a way it feels less necessary for a mini 5x5 to exist.\n* I'm catching more on the Zhisu 5x5 than on the MGC, but I don't know if it just needs breaking in. I think it got less frequent already, so it might be just me not being used to the cube.\n* The shades are great, similar to the Aosu WR M with a slightly lighter green and a slightly darker orange. I definitely prefer it over the MGC color scheme.\n* Both came too lose out of the box. No big deal, tightening them didn't lose speed.\n* And a less important thing, but I'd have preferred if they had kept the original names (Zhisu and Zhichuang), renaming all of them to Zhilong kinda breaks the pattern they have going on with other cubes.\n\nOverall, the 4x4 is easier to recommend, as I think the 5x5 is indeed too small for most people while not providing as much advantage over a regular sized 5x5.

While the spring curve describes the inward force in function of how much the center piece is being pushed away from the core, the curve for the corner/edge magnets would describe the magnetic force pressing layers together in function of the angle of a turn (it doesn't have a window in it, and it's periodic, repeating as you turn the cube repeatedly).\n\nIf you graph magnetic attraction in function of the angle (from 0\u02da to 90\u02da as a quarter-turn move completes), you get a U-shaped curve, but I think it's more interesting to model the force required for each additional angle of the turn. That curve starts high as you begin a turn because you need to overcome the magnetic attraction, then it lowers and may even become negative as the magnets get close together and finish the turn for you. You overshoot when there's enough inertia in the turn to go past the high part of the next turn (i.e. overcoming the magnetic attraction again as the magnets move past each other).\n\nNow, it's true that corner/edge magnets also affect the force (and thus friction) between the layers, but that's a different source of force, separate from the force applied by the springs.

This conflict is inevitable: so long as it's possible for humans to group together against one another, they will, and it doesn't even matter who's right: The distinction isn't one between good and bad, the distiction that really matters is that you fight for who you identify with. Thus, conflict itself between friend enemy is the foundation of politics.\n\nPlease note that this argument was produced as a justification of another argument, that it's possible for a legitimate constitutional order to come into existence while representing the will of the people. You see, if a constitutional order falls, and another one takes its place, how can the new order claim to represent the will of the people if there is no way for the people to make any decisions during this void?\n\nThe answer is that a political community fundamentally arises from a group in conflict with another, and there is no need of any existing political framework to establish a new constitutional order, you only need a people who strongly identifies as a group. Since conflict is the ultimate source of the political, it is legitimate for a political group to identify itself in opposition to an enemy. In a way, this is a collective form of self-defense; a third party can't judge if you feel that your identity is threatened by someone, only you know that because it's your identity. Similarly, a political group is justified in taking action aganst another, because only they know what constitutes a threat, what makes the \"other\" an enemy. The argument is that this enmity is the core of the political, and that's why it is sufficient for forming the basis of a new government.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat said, this argument is ultimately used to define the state in opposition to the \"enemy\".

The biggest difference is that the attraction/repulsion force of magnets increases much faster as they get closer, like in this [chart](https://www.kjmagnetics.com/largergraph.asp?CI=4&D=0.272809366407938&T=0.118110236220472&L=&W=&OD=0.315&ID=0.15748031496063&PF=0.27&PFMAX=2.6771615397496&C=8.5287&XSCALE=0.15748031496063&YSCALE=3&X=0.15748031496063&calcType=ring&GRADE=50).

You can play around with a magnet calculator like [the K&J Magnetics one](https://www.kjmagnetics.com/calculator.asp) that I used to make that chart.\n\nI don't have a maglev cube myself, so I can't say for sure how it affects feel, but some reviewers commented on maglev cubes having worse corner cutting and being bad on tigher settings. That would make sense, because they're using the same tensioniong mechanism as springs, but the repulsion force of magnets doesn't scale with distance the same way that springs do. What's curious to me is that if you look at the Gan 12 maglev's page, they show a chart that demonstrates this, but they call it \"exponential decompression\" and present it like it's a good thing.\n\nI expect maglev to improve a bit, but I don't know if it's even possible to get around the corner cutting problem.

It's also the one I use.\n* You gotta be so fast to get actual benefit from those alternate H and F perms with AUF. I feel like I'd lose time to extra recognition.\n* It frustrates me how the a/b nomenclature for PLL is inconsistent. Aa and Ab are clockwise and counterclockwise, but then Ua and Ub go the other way around. Doing a J perm twice gives an N perm, but it's reversed in that Ja U2 Ja gives Nb and Jb U2 Jb gives Na.\n* OLL 55 is my least favorite right now. It's rarer than the others and I've recently switched to a new alg so I'm slow every time.\n* I usually prefer to mirror OLL algs front to back, like with 36. Maybe the L versions would be faster if my left fingers were faster. Similarly, Ja can be so fast but I'm bad at the good algs so I do a janky Jb mirrored front to back. Don't judge me.\n* I can't believe those U and H perms with S slices are actually fast. Not that *I* can do them fast, of course.\n\n(EDIT: New link using Google Drive)", "created_utc": "1627404111.0", "edited": "1627420651.0", "id": "h6q3cpl", "is_submitter": "True", "link_id": "t3_osqdry", "parent_id": "t3_osqdry", "score": "10", "subreddit": "Cubers", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r6a3"}, {"author": "ArkhanLahyet", "body": "In modern databases, sequential ids aren't necessarily bad, but they come with the disadvantage that the database needs to be centralized to a certain extent, otherwise you could have two cubes on opposite sides of the galaxy discover different species and assign the same number to them.\n\n(There are other problems as well, like third parties being able to guess information because of the sequential nature of the ids like we do all the time here, but I wouldn't think the Borg are worried about that.)\n\nAn alternative (that we use here on 21st century Earth) is a universally unique identifier (uuid).

Today, Andonean is a mostly dead language used only in Dalusiana, capital of Marelo and former capital of the Andonis Empire. Most of the young in Dalusiana still learn Andonean as a secondary language, mostly because of historical reasons, but also because many words in modern languages are derived from Andonean. Many historical buildings in Dalusiana and in the rest of Marelo have inscriptions in Andonean.  \nThe language makes extensive use of inflections, particularly of verbs (they even include an abstract person, like the gender-neutral 3rd person \"one\"). Notably, nouns can be singular, plural or generic (for which no number is assigned).  \nAn interesting thing to note in the phrase is that *toce* is in the optative instead of indicative. This kind of irregularity is still present in a few verbs that indicate opinion.  \nAlso, *imistance*, meaning \"to appeal\" contains a direct object pronoun; in that sense, it works in a very similar manner to the spanish verb \"gustar\"; the idea of \"favourite\" is formed by this verb + *stae* (especially or greatly).  \nA note on the *imites*: They are a small furry animal resembling hares; a southern imites is a different species from the eastern imites, and therefore they're distinguished. A popular domestic breed of southern imites is the southern pink imites (yeah, not \"pink southern imites\"), so called for no reason that I know of (their fur is either brown, white or grey).  \n  \n(And an out of character note: The phonology was mostly based on the English pronounciation of Latin and its love for schwas (\u0259).

The language is notable for the use of particles in the beginning of sentences that 'set' the grammatical mood. It relies on particles to inflect verbs.  \nNow a litte backstory; The Garronian people live in an underground nation at an unknown location under Europe; almost nothing is known about them in the overworld, as people rarely find entrances to the land of Garron, and even more rarely they decide to come back (it's not like anyone's going to believe in the stories they tell). Also, the entrances hidden across the countries seem to change over time. The people exist since ancient times, and they are far from technologically advanced; they don't seem to offer more than cultural explanations for their origins, which remains a big mystery until this day.  \nTheir language existed much before a script was assigned to it. As a result, different regions have adoped different scripts from different people who have entered Garron; the phrase presented is in the french variant of Garronian, which adopted the french way of writing sounds (for example, writing /o/ commonly as \"au\" and marking plurals, even when they're homophones with their singulars). An interesting feature is that verb infections are written as separated words. here is the same phrase rendered in another 'writing style' from a spanish traveller:  \n**So s\u00ednole parji\u00e1n par la rus\u00f3. To p\u00f3rena \u00e9lenile perde**  \nTo this day, their existence is an enigma.

It personally reminds me of Irish.\nHere, someone called Eiyn is said to be \"unharmed\", a common slang for a very attractive person (male or female), and the Prymren is mentioned as a possible cause (the construction *ta aerlentine* is informally used as an equivalent to *eafad*, \"because\", which would require a different grammatical construction).  \nThe day of Prymren is widely celebrated in all Northern and Eastern Dahar, and in parts of Southern Dahar close to the winter solstice; it's a holiday that has existed for over half a millenium, and interestingly, the colour pink is associated with this day but red isn't.", "created_utc": "1423963541.0", "edited": "False", "id": "colq9jk", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_2vvvgs", "parent_id": "t3_2vvvgs", "score": "6", "subreddit": "conlangs", "subreddit_id": "t5_2red7"}, {"author": "ArkhanLahyet", "body": "[The airplane guys](http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Itsu).

Try to figure out how to generate words that resemble Spanish, for example.\nTo summarize the very basic, you first separate your sounds in categories (V=vowels, C=consonants, F=word-final consonants, L=liquids, as many as you need). Then you write the possible syllables (CVC, CLVC, CVCC, CVCF...). If you need digraphs/double letters, use another character like \u00e7 instead, and at the end substitute it with rewrite rules such as \u00e7|th.\nYou also calibrate the letter frequency. From your list, I assume you don't want nearly as many *\u00e6* than *a*. But that requires some time.\nAnyway, you'll inevitably stumble upon words you don't want, such as \"Qoqy\", maybe? It's interesting to not randomly generate enerything in your conlang (be mindful of affixes, inflection, derivations, you'll want to generate the root instead).", "created_utc": "1421024726.0", "edited": "False", "id": "cnm0umv", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_2s3w9a", "parent_id": "t3_2s3w9a", "score": "4", "subreddit": "conlangs", "subreddit_id": "t5_2red7"}, {"author": "ArkhanLahyet", "body": "It really varies from language to language depending on its nature.
