However, I would rate myself confidently as a C1 based on the feedback I have gotten from my friends, their family members that speak only Spanish, and strangers I have talked to at quinceaneras and fiestas (take from that what you will haha).\n\nAt first when I started learning Spanish I would listen to music. For me this was way better than reading a Spanish book or some traditional way of learning. I would (and I still do) listen to music from artists like J Balvin, Maluma, and Reik. I would read the lyrics, translate them, and of course sing my heart out. This helped me get a decent amount of vocabulary and helped me grasp a lot of grammar rules. Singing was a great way for me to help with pronunciation of words and helped a lot with my speaking skills.\n\nWhat really helped me take off though was learning vocabulary. I did not simply use a premade list. What I did was whenever I came across a word I did not know in conversation, in articles, or in songs, I would add these words to a list. If I also thought to myself \"How do I say \\_\\_\\_\\_ in spanish?\", I would look it up and add it to my list. At night I would go over the words I did not know (at first it was like 50-60 words a night when I was just starting to learn. Now it is just like 1-2 words a week haha. I use an app (apparently I am not allowed to mention this app and I am not sure why, but the initials for the app are SD) that lets you make lists and gives you all the different definitions of a word with example sentences for each translation of the word). There is no getting around learning vocabulary. At some point you will have to put the time to memorize vocabulary. If you have never seen or heard of a word before it will be impossible to recognize it in conversation and will inhibit you from fully understanding what is being said. Unless of course you go to a Spanish speaking country and then immersion will take care of that for you. Immersion was not an option for me so I had to stick to memorization.\n\nIn terms of improving my speaking ability, there is really only one way to improve that and that is by speaking to people. I am grateful to live in Texas and be surrounded by a large Hispanic community. I have several friends that I only speak Spanish with and I have met a lot of their family members who only speak Spanish, so I spend hours a week speaking only Spanish. After doing this for over 3 months I have no problem speaking Spanish. However, I am not sure where you are located. I was fortunate to not have to worry about this. If anyone has any other suggestions on how they improved their speaking I would love to hear them.\n\nThe most important piece of advice I learned was not being afraid to make a mistake. Mistakes are how we learn. I have found that spanish speakers in general are very helpful and will politely correct you errors and continue to try and talk with you in spanish.\n\nGood luck!", "created_utc": "1599457363.0", "edited": "False", "id": "g4b0wly", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_io15iv", "parent_id": "t3_io15iv", "score": "2", "subreddit": "Spanish", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qtt1"}, {"author": "MajesticNectarine", "body": "Jajaja no mames \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "created_utc": "1599199953.0", "edited": "False", "id": "g3yddv9", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_ilx32z", "parent_id": "t3_ilx32z", "score": "1", "subreddit": "chile", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rer8"}, {"author": "MajesticNectarine", "body": "Club de Cuervos is great.
