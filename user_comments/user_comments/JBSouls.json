Most of the (older) adults in my life don't know more than a few words or phrases in another language - that includes English - simply because they've only ever learned it in school on a very basic level and haven't had any need to use it since then... and over decades it's easy to forget everything.   \n\n\nHeck, at least 80% of my own proficiency in English comes from what I learned outside of a classroom on my own. And the few short years since leaving school (and not using French and Spanish anymore) mean I can understand less than 50% compared to what I could before.
