So, I would say yes, relative to those with only phantasia.\n\nMe for example, I have to make a conscious effort to keep things going. Every added detail needs more effort. It's like I'm juggling or spinning plates. So, it's not always easy to make up a world and just explore it, since I need to be always maintaining it.\n\nThat's when I'm just imagining things though. When I'm using my imagination as a tool for thinking. It's like what I imagine adapts itself to the thoughts I'm exploring on their own. These representations aren't very complex though, they're kinda focused to helping me understand the thoughts I'm thinking.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT:\n\nSince you're into this stuff.

This conscious effort ended up being a sort of marker in my array of memories for me to know it was my imagination, rather than a real memory. \n\nThe fact I had to actually choose the details of the visual, etc made it hard for me to confuse it with reality. Because I recognized it as my 'output' as opposed to actually reality which is something I receive as 'input'. The shallow depths of the mind's eye I have access to make it so that is the case for me. \n\nWhen I smoked cannabis or when I was dreaming (lucid or not) I realized that my imagination did things I did not make it do. That's when I thought that perhaps those with natural hyperphantasia are like that to a lesser extent of course. That maybe they have access to greater depths of their minds eye, but not necessarily completely proportional control. \n\nSo, a bit of more their subconscious mind (relative to those with phantasia) does more of the 'work' and also some extra stuff they didn't consciously intend. Hence why some of them sometimes confuse it with real memories, because they remember their perception of the imagined memory as 'input'. Which kind of is, from the perspective of their conscious mind, since the unintended stuff was created by their subconscious.\n\nSo, that's why the triangle moves for you. It's that you've reached deeper parts of the mind's eye needed for the prophantasia, but you don't necessarily have 100% control yet. While I think this is the case either way, another contributing factor might be related to your previous post of sometimes falling asleep. There's less of an awake mind to keep things in control.\n\nThese are just my opinions on the matter, this is quite uncharted territory and don't claim these to be facts.

For the youtuber I linked he's in pitch black space and he says he feels his body is traveling somewhere and then appears at his destination. Monroe did mention something about a pitch black portal though.\n\nI've thought there might be structures containing many portals/windows like in this [art work](https://www.alexgrey.com/art-images/Oversoul-1999-Alex-Grey-watermarked.jpg). I think these structures are like \"server clusters\" in which each \"server\" is one parallel dimension and so it is a \"cluster of dimensons\". And you can take whatever dimensional exit you wish if you have access to it.\n\nI believe the ones that astral entities use is a different type of portal though. As you probably know, the astral has \"layers\". I think the portals are just used to go from one layer to another, within a dimension/server if you will.

When I say \"type\", that is NOT euphemism for \"hotness from 1-10\" or anything of the sort.

And perhaps not so subjective when you realize that there are unconscious biological factors at play, such as [scent](https://www.mensjournal.com/health-fitness/the-connection-between-scent-and-sexual-attraction-20160222/#:~:text=The%20potential%20scent%20attraction%20that's,that%20effect%20the%20immune%20system),  [kinship](https://youtu.be/JPYmarGO5jM?t=2639), etc.\n\nThe problem with \"beauty standards\" is that they took a set of features and elevated them to the status of \"most beautiful\" at the exclusion of all other types of features. Monopolizing people's *public* opinion on the matter, but not necessarily their *private* opinion. So, you end up with men being shamed for their natural preferences in women.\n\nLong story short, I used the word \"type\" to be *inclusive* of all the things \"beauty standards\" are *exclusive* of. I am attracted to things other aren't. I like the bump some women have in their nose and dislike rhinoplasticity surgeries. I like thick women and dislike when they lose too much weight and lose the hip-to-waist ratios I prefer, etc.\n\nI was not trying to sugar coat anything.

The astral selves of the adults were a bit scared of him, but the girl's wasn't. The astral body of the girl even talked to him, saying \"I know what you are! You are a ghost/projection/etc!\". He then asked her were they were, their location to see where he had ended up. An adult's astral self quickly interrupted \"don't tell him!\". So, he just left.\n\nThe point is, that the astral bodies are still there being carried by the physical body. And seem limited to basic instincts/emotions.

There's an experience you can have where your consciousness goes to a parallel dimension and temporarily inhabits the body of another \"you\". Robert Monroe called this [Locale III](https://thingsthatmadeanimpression.wordpress.com/2017/05/13/excerpt-from-journeys-out-of-the-body-by-robert-a-monroe-locale-iii/). There'a a user here with a youtube [channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHu1BIbnQYwHA0vprsl93ew) who has them regularly and he calls it \"Beyond Body\". Anyway, in one of his videos, he described one of these experiences, in which he went to the body of another 'him' and THEN he went to have a lucid dream in the mind of this other him! One of my theories would be that you had a similar experience, except that instead of having a lucid dream, you had an astral projection!\n\n2nd. I came across a video of a girl who related her DMT experience. She had problems with alcohol, drunk driving, etc. When she did DMT she experienced herself getting into a car crash and dying as the ambulance came. She said it felt very very real. I'm thinking there's a possibility that you might've accessed something like on your own? The reason I think that's possible is bc Monroe talked about a place he called the [I-There](https://olli-reincarnation.weebly.com/uploads/3/0/3/4/30342001/the_mystery_of_reincarnation_(4b).pdf), which was inhabited by the personalities of his previous lives, as well as gave him access to replay every memory of his current life.

I've noticed in my many AP's that there's different \"layers\" to the astral. Monroe mentioned that he encountered a being once that told him that there were 7 levels. \n\nOne of those levels, is actually the one where you will find yourself during sleep paralysis (SP). Those experiences can feel extremely real (as you did mention) and many times you're not able to move. But you CAN move, it's just not easy and you may not get it the first time. Here's a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8h5KCrXoZU&t=1s) of a guy who was able to do it (though he believed it was a lucid dream). These people, while not out of body, do experience one of their astral bodies and perceive their rooms with it.\n\nNow, many AP authors have noted, that people involuntarily and unconsciously project every night. You may hear stories of projectors seeing people in their household in the astral doing mundane things (like watching TV). It is also possible to remember these experiences or even to become \"lucid\" during them and take control of the experience, as with dreams. \n\nYou've probably heard that SP is scary. Often it is, especially when there's some entity making it so. Where I'm going with this, is that it is possible for you to project unconsciously and be out and doing stuff, while at the same time, there being an entity that's making things uncomfortable for you. \n\nIn fact, your story sounds much like a story a friend of mine told me, same structure I'd say. In her experience, instead of witches there was a single male entity \"the God of Death\". And it told her she needed to be sacrificed and become his wife. And she, like you, felt like she was somehow powerful enough to defend herself. Then she woke and went back to sleep. When going back she found herself in some wood area, there were other girls there, just like with you there were other men. They were all wearing white gowns and barefoot....she later woke up, back in her body and was fine.\n\nThere's many intricacies in AP that are not talked about very often by the community. Since it's heavily focused on beginner stuff. And while the AP authors do make some mention, most people who've not experienced that don't make the connection. I barely hear people talk about the layers of AP, with the exception of a couple of \"Experienced Projectors\", for example.

Notice how both images have \"planets\" depicted. The latter more explicitly, but the first one also has it inside the body of the \"being\".

And yes, your experience is completely normal. \n\nThe panic you felt is a notorious obstacle to those who want to start doing astral projection. When you are in your astral body, you have access to more of your consciousness. More doors open up for you. And behind some of those doors is panic and fear. Not everyone goes through this, but many do.\n\nAnd the slowness is also normal. You didn't have control, as most of us don't, especially the first times. Slowness is very normal, as is floating, spinning, having a distorted body, blurry or no vision, being unable to speak, etc.\n\nAs for the girl you met. I can't say for sure. It might've been someone deceased, or it might've been an entity of these realms taking the form of a girl. This is still uncharted territory and we don't have a consensus of what all the being you encounter are.\n\nThis last part is my own theory. I believe there's 'layers' to the astral realm. And the layer you experienced, from what you write, is the one where sleep paralysis happens. Yes, I think that sleep paralysis experiences are not dreams, they are astral experiences. You may not get out of body in all of them, but you do experience engaging your astral body and experiencing reality from that perspective. This layer is where most people find that they are able to 'feel presences' and 'feel watched' as you described. \n\nHere's a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8h5KCrXoZU&t=1s) of a guy had an experience like the one I'm describing, although he thought it was a lucid dream.", "created_utc": "1654371575.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ib6c8po", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_v4j2i9", "parent_id": "t3_v4j2i9", "score": "1", "subreddit": "AstralProjection", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rylp"}, {"author": "bonoboalien", "body": "Yes!

Sometimes I would see and talk to dead relatives. Other times I would be floating around a continuous number line in \u201couter space\u201d. The most interesting reoccurring experience I had though was visiting peoples houses that I had never actually been to, in my \u201cdreams\u201d. In these \u201cdreams\u201d I would visit a house and be looking in from an aerial perspective, and would know where everything was and what was in each room. I realized these were not just dreams but were real houses, when I would see the houses for the first time in person IRL.\n\nYes, this is definitely AP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>a memory of being in an all white light enclosed space where I could see the timeline bubbles of \u201clife\u201d and I was able to choose any bubble life a channel to view/ zoom into from an aerial perspective. I don\u2019t know whose life I was viewing\n\nI've heard of things somewhat similar to this, and there may be more that I haven't heard of. One of them I heard of in Robert Monroe's 3rd book. He described a \"place\" in his own consciousness that he could access when doing AP. He called it the \"[I-There](https://olli-reincarnation.weebly.com/uploads/3/0/3/4/30342001/the_mystery_of_reincarnation_(4b).pdf)\". It was inhabited, surprisingly, by the personalities of his previous lives.\n\nI imagine he probably had access to viewing those lives, perhaps that's what you found? He did explicitly mention having access to pretty much re-living all the memories of his life if he wanted to, as if they had been recorded.\n\nSomeone I know told me years before I knew of this that during a psilocybin experience he saw these \"windows\" and each of them had a memory of his life. I don't know if it's related to what Monroe described. Anyway, these are the things I know that best approach what you talked about here.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>\\-**vivid dreams of waking in someone else\u2019s body and bed, walking through the home and having the sense that it\u2019s \u201cme\u201d but in another life**. Some of these dreams seem to take please over a long period of time, like experiencing the first person viewpoint of different times in another persons\u2019 life. Some of these \u201cstory lines\u201d have come back to me in pieces through dreams over years of my own life. And it\u2019s like I got back into these dreams and suddenly remember where I left off, as if I was watching a movie. It\u2019s such a weird feeling being back to a dream place when I sometimes haven\u2019t dreamed of it and have had no memory of it for years. Now that I\u2019m 29, there are a few places I have seen over and over and over in these dreams, but I don\u2019t know what the places are and have no control over choosing to visit or not\n\nPretty confident I know what this is. I have had this as well and it's also described in Robert Monroe's 1st book. Basically, it's a form of AP, in which your consciousness travels to a parallel reality and temporarily inhabits the body of another \"you\". Monroe called this going to \"[Locale III](https://thingsthatmadeanimpression.wordpress.com/2017/05/13/excerpt-from-journeys-out-of-the-body-by-robert-a-monroe-locale-iii/)\" Some of those realities are very similar to our own, some very strange. There's a youtuber who has them regularly, he calls it \"[Beyond Body](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHu1BIbnQYwHA0vprsl93ew)\". He browses this sub as well.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>\\-I\u2019ve felt a sensation of jumping back into my body, but had no realization I ever left (asleep)\n\nMultiple AP authors have noted that people project all the time without noticing or remembering. I myself have seen people in my household projecting and they have no memory of it after. You may just be having AP experiences that you don't remember, but are able to feel when you get back to the body. Sounds like this is what's happening.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>\\-I\u2019ve been awake and lost sensation of my body as if it\u2019s not there\n\nThe brain disconnects from the body around the time of paralysis. I have at times felt something similar to chills when this happens, except it's not cold of course. That may be it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>\\-lucid dreams where I decided to meet my future children\n\nPrecognitive dreams it seems. No experience with that here, but I've heard of it. Steven Greer said he met his wife in a lucid dream before he ever saw her in real life.\n\nThese are just my best guesses based on my knowledge/experiences and what you said.

I mean, from the perspective of the 'the phase' being everything that isn't the waking state, he is right. But to say that that which isn't the waking state (the phase) doesn't have layers that can be differentiated into what we call LD and AP is wrong.\n\nThere's been two experiences I've had in which I went from an AP to an LD. Both times had the exact same tactile feeling, but the first time I was blind during the transition, the second time I could see. That time I saw myself floating up towards a white light. Once I entered it, I was in a dream. \n\nI've been able to enter my mind's eye in the waking world when smoking weed (which I haven't done in 5 years) and in the mornings right after waking up. Both experiences are quite unique. The weed one allowed me to more directly explore my own mind with my subconscious imagination merely acting as a graphics interface for me. And the morning one is much like a dream, but far less vivid. The \"rules\" of what is possible are much more like in real life, because my prefrontal cortex is active ([prefrontal cortex shuts down while sleeping](https://www.science.org/content/article/brain-disconnects-during-sleep)).\n\nAlso, I've had many experiences that have led me to believe the \"astral\", in this case everything that isn't the physical world and isn't your mind's eye, has layers. But that doesn't pertain directly to these questions.\n\nAs for your 2nd question. I do believe we will all one day live in \"both worlds\". In a way, we already do live in two if you count your imagination. Have you ever driven from home to work while daydreaming? So, I don't think it's that crazy to think about. I think our consciousness is equipped to handle it. \n\nI actually did not finish the book all the way. So, I can't confirm he's really saying that it's all in our heads. But I really doubt it. All he needs is evidence that people can get information from astral travels that can be confirmed independently (which I'm sure he's aware of) and the claim is then illogical.

But I think that LD/AP can help with the 'internal' part of a skill. I've heard of people using LDs to speak to big audiences in their dreams and get over their fear of public speaking. In the bike example I think it might've helped your cousin with the \"I'm going to fall\" anxiety associated with learning to ride a bike. I've actually ridden a \"bike\" in the astral and a \"car\" in a lucid dream. In neither case did I have to deal with the complications of irl physics, but I can see how it can make you get over the fear. \n\nWhere the skills can directly translate is from AP to an LD. Once I went through walls on APs I was suddenly able to do it in LDs. That's why I'm really excited to learn to bi-locate and have 360 degree vision so I can do it in dreams too.\n\nThis last one is a theory I have. Twice during APs I've been able to remote view. I'd never done this while awake. Then one morning I remote viewed by accident. I believe that in the astral we are able to more easily access our psychic abilities. I think we can train them in the astral to get a feel for them/used to them. So, it'll be easier once we try to use them in the physical world, since we know what it feels like.

I've heard of aphants who dream, but just cannot then re-create the imagery of it. Just wondering.\n\nI'd recommend checking out [Michael Raduga](https://obe4u.com/how-to-lucid-dream/) for methods.

He also links to other sources that have helped him, including this one [Sitting in Power](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yS5uhzEWJU). \n\nThey basically put their hands above the would be healed and imagine (I think) a light coming from the bottom up. And by having their hands and intentions on the healing, the healing is done. \n\nI thought that if there's any truth to it, I ought to be able to do it in the astral. I wanted to heal a pet bird who'd been making noises. Got out of body and went to the bird. Put my hands up, but was drawing a blank. \n\nThen, there was someone there who looked like my mom (but wasn't) and started giving me instructions. It gave me these phrases/mantras to repeat. First one was \"I am red\". Don't remember the others exactly, but they all had to do w/ colors. I shortly after lost it and was back in bed. I was not able to do the healing.\n\nIn retrospect, I thought that perhaps the color mantras I was being given corresponded to the chakras. Since the first chakra, the one at the bottom relative to the others, is red. And perhaps the mantras unlocked/activated the gates for the healing light to go through, etc. \n\nThat's it for the healing, though I'll tell you about one more thing that I think is relevant.\n\nA few times while out of body I was able to remote view. That is, see something far away or in close detail, while my astral body is elsewhere (not to be confused w/ teleporting there). Then one day, while trying to either AP/LD/etc in the morning, I found myself remote viewing! \n\nI believe perhaps that these things are easier in the astral (since the thought/etheric floodgates are more unobstructed) and that maybe you can practice in the astral before you do things irl. I believe this can be applied to healing. And I have heard of people healing in the astral (though in other ways I'm now reading about from Michael Raduga's site). \n\nSo, yes.

So, I've done all 3, not DMT. I'm experienced most with LD, then AP and obviously RV it's only been one time. I'd done LD spontaneously in the past, and recently started tying more consciously. I first AP'd by accident while trying to LD using the WILD (Wake Induced Lucid Dreaming) technique. And now I RV'd by accident for the first time while trying to AP.\n\nOne discernable difference I found between LD and AP was flying. It took me a while to 'learn' to fly in LD's. And I've noticed that any 'forces' that support/resist me are all my own mind. When I flew in AP I noticed that this environment simply ALLOWS me to do this. There are different game rules in this state and I'm subject to them and flying is simply permitted. Ofc in dreams you can ANYTHING, but my mind got in the way bc it's \"not possible\", fear, etc. But in the astral (if you will) there was less need to believe. There is *some* need (especially the 1st times), but once you take off the environment supports you 100%.\n\nI also noticed that my mind's eye works fine in AP's, but not LD's. For example, I could play music 'in my head' in the astral no problem. But when I tried it in a dream, I would not hear it 'in my head', I would hear it omnipresently in the environment. And when I tried to visualize an idea in a dream I couldn't. I was stuck at 'ideation' and could never get to 'imagination'. Any successful visualization I did not see in my head, but rather appearing next to me in the reality of the dream world. Because of this I've come to believe that dreams are journeys INTO your mind's eye.\n\nAlso, to further confirm my last statement, there's been a couple of times where I unintentionally went from AP to LD. I felt vibrations, got out of my body, but my mind was already on a fast elevator down to an LD and there was no stopping it. In both these experiences I felt as if I was submerged and descending down a body of water. The first time I was completely blind, I saw all black. And once I hit the 'bottom', my vision eventually cleared into the landscape of a dream. But the 2nd time, I was able to have vision and saw myself from 1st person floating 'up' (despite feeling I'm descending in a body of water) into a while light. My vision was not that great, so it was not that bright and there were shades of gray around it. And afterwards I found myself in the dream. I believe that light was my mind's eye, as well as the dream world, since I believe they're the same. I also have done some meditations that told me this was the same.\n\nI first RV'd unknowingly during AP's. My theory is that since you're already in that state and w/out a body, the thought circuit lines are less blocked and 'psychic' abilities more easily come as intended. First time I saw a spider and another I saw a structure. Now here comes today. I've lately been trying to go into AP right after I first wake up, then I forget about it and go to sleep. At least once a week it'll turn into an LD/AP/SP.\n\nThis time I found myself perceiving what I knew was a tile wall in my bathroom! It was real time since the lighting of the place will change slightly with the time of day bc of the sun. And it looked like it was at that time of the day (which I was able verify bc it's my house lol). I then tried to move my perception forwards, intending to go through the wall to perceive my backyard, but I couldn't. I was stopped at around 'nose' distance from my visual perception of the tile and the tile. I did not have a nose ofc, and I had no corporeal perceptions as I 'bumped'. The thing I found differently here was that all the perceptional textures were quite close the same as in my waking consciousness. I had no body ofc, I think I was just a point of consciousness (no 360 degree vision, though I believe that can be done).\n\nThat's it, just pointing out some of my observations!", "created_utc": "1608503015.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ggiwuk5", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_ibssd6", "parent_id": "t3_ibssd6", "score": "1", "subreddit": "AstralProjection", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rylp"}, {"author": "bonoboalien", "body": "I actually have no mediumship experience, but wanted to try healing once in the astral to see if it could be done.

I first saw some info on healing from this video [Shaman Oaks healer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXxaI70HNUU) (he does link to the sources of where he learned).\n\nI attempted this for the first time a few days ago to try healing on a pet bird since she's been making strange noises. I got out of body and went to where the birds are. Put my hands up like the guy said in the video and was kinda drawing a blank. An astral entity that looked like my mom, but wasn't (some say it was my guide) appeared and started to give me instructions.\n\nIt told me to repeat these mantras I guess. First one was \"I am red\". I don't remember the others exactly, but there were all phrases that had to do w/ colors. I repeated a few, but then got unstable and was back on my body. I was not able to accomplish the healing.\n\nAfter waking I wondered if perhaps the mantras I was being instructed to repeat were related to the chakras. Since, the first chakras is red and from the video it was said that you needed to envision a healing light that comes up from the bottom up. So, I guess the mantras were to activate/unblock/etc the chakras to allow the healing?\n\nI don't know.

Sometimes they are helped and sometimes not. This has also happened with psychedelics to some.\n\nDuring NDE's people certainly experience something like that.

The 'astral' as I'm calling it is subjective and we don't see exactly what things are. Someone said in another post that they asked to see their 'guides' and his 6yo nephew appeared. So, obviously that person's nephew is not his guide, he did not see things objectively. And all of that in turn, combined with our need for coming to conclusions creates what I'm not describing as a mismatch in narratives. \n\nIt's one thing if someone perceives someone is swimming in a pool, while another perceives they're swimming in the ocean. They're both similar. The difference I explained in the OP seemed like too much for me. Being guided by higher beings vs being left to our collective ignorance is very different. \n\nThe OBE accounts I describe come from Robert Monroe and William Buhlman. And they themselves checked with many sources, so I don't think anyone is lying. But as you said,   each may be taking what they saw/experienced too literally. \n\nI believe we also have 'layers' that may be simultaneously doing different things. For example, Monroe would talk to the astral version of people while awake seemingly and they'd have no memory of it.

And the girl I consider the cutest from work appeared. I believe if I had said \"hottest\" the hottest girl would've appeared instead.

One night I had a non-lucid dream that was all about my middle school experience. Woke up and went back to bed to a lucid dream.

Then, suddenly w/out asking for its specifically, a girl from my middle school appeared fully rendered/functional!

So, if I'd known that was the mode I may have tried to ask for the girl that I preferred from the \"middle school\" part of my brain's library. And if I have no idea what mood my subconscious is in, perhaps I could ask like \"give me the hottest girl you have for me at this time\".\n\nBecause my subconscious may have all the ingredients for a sandwich, but I'm asking for a hotdog.

I've noticed that dreams are like journeys not out of body, but rather INTO your mind's eye. For example, when I play music 'in my head' in a dream, I hear it everywhere, it is omnipresent. But when I do it in AP, I do hear it only 'in my head'. Same with visuals. I can visualize normally in an AP, but in a dream I can't, I can only do 'ideation'.

I mean that I have a dream, that somehow fixes some subconscious wiring that was creating blocks for me from doing something. Then that something becomes easier. \n\nPerhaps as you go to sleep you can have that intention. For your guides or whomever to please help you overcome this thing.

When I had prophantasia from smoking, one time it sort of acted as a graphics interface between me and my subconscious to some extent. \n\nFor example, I was talking with a friend, who has a different communication style from me. My prophantasia projected an imagination hologram graph in front of me. This graph changed/morphed shape as he talked, filling in the gaps of meaning I would normally miss from hearing his speech, etc. Then I would ask him \"you mean *this* right?\" and he would be like \"yes! exactly!\". \n\nI think a deep part of me understands him perfectly, but I don't have access to that. So, in that enhanced state my prophantasia imagination was able to bridge the gaps of understanding between my conscious and subconscious using a visual language that I somehow understood. \n\nI know that is a rather crazy story. But I believe our imagination often acts as a metaphorical interpreter of  our own subconscious. It's just that this was a very enhanced and palpable experience, not subtle at all lol.

In contrast, government ventures can fail in their intended purpose and STILL continue to gain political profit, usually done by controlling the narrative (blame others, we just need more money, etc).\n\nIt's possible that a capitalist that failed a venture also believes that others are to blame and that he/she would've succeeded if they just had more capital. But you are out of money and out of attempts. In this way, capitalism keeps innovation honest to its own delusions, while socialism enables them, and the people bear that cost.\n\nMoreover, socialism gives the keys of access to 'ultimate power' to a few individuals. And they can use force to keep it. While capitalism is more distributed and they can only continue to meet the market's needs better than the competition to maintain their position. Absolute power corrupts absolutely and individuals in a capitalist society can only gain and maintain as much power as they are meeting the needs of the market. Collective greed as it were, checks individual greed as a self-corrective mechanism.\n\nI am obviously not talking about crony capitalism, where they buy the government to some extent to rig the markets. And I know it will happen. But I do believe that this is a less dangerous situation than to just hand some people the entire set of keys.\n\nThe situation is obviously still more complicated.

It was a hallucination where I was in a type of void hell full of fire facing something that looked like the Eye of Mordor. It wanted to absorb me or something and spoke a devilish language. I resisted, I was very scared. Over the years they've gotten less scary and intense. Another a few years later was a couple of 'shadow demons' covering my mouth and nose to asphyxiate in my bed. Lately I had the thought that if I wasn't scared, maybe they wouldn't be so scary. I was right. I had a very mild experience at first, where instead of a scary demon, it was a kid trying to prank/annoy me by putting grass in my ear. Another later was that I felt that my 'mom' had put a small dog or cat in my bed (she used to do this to wake me up for school when I was a kid). And another time I again felt that there was a small dog or cat in my bed. I love animals so it's crazy how it changed to something pleasant!

There is a collective spirit or self, as Carl Jung said. That collective self is at the moment broken into many parts, that are in conflict with one another, not realizing they are part of one. I believe those sandmen are 'spirits' or small parts of the collective spirit. Ofc, we are all responsible co-creators of them, so it's us all along.\n\nI do think though, that we have a say in the dream narrative. I've had a share of lucid dream and I think that we individually have a stronger pull on the reins of that narrative. And when we aren't, that's when the sandman's pull on the narrative is stronger. I think non-lucid dream narratives are co-created by the sandmen and your subconscious. Sometimes one has more pull than another.\n\nOne time an aunt came to my home after a difficult event.
