In *T\u00fa eres cantante*, \"you\" is the subject of the sentence. They are often omitted (Spanish is pro-drop (pronoun-drop)). Overuse of the subject pronoun is a common mistake learners make.\n\nPossessive adjectives are pretty straightforward. However, note that they are plural/singular based off of the thing you posses, not the person possessing. So you say:  *Sus libros est\u00e1n aqu\u00ed; \u00e9l siempre los lee* and not *Su libros...* (it doesn't matter that it's just one person owning the books; there are multiple books).\n\nDirect objects are directly receiving an action (as in \"te quiero\" (I love **you**) or \"te abrazo\" (I hug **you**)). Indirect object pronouns are affected by a verb as the recipient of something (as in \"te lo doy\" (I give it **to you**)). Either way, \"te\" is both indirect and direct and doesn't have a distinction like in the third person with \"lo\" vs \"le\" so you don't need to worry.\n\nPrepositional pronouns, like the name suggests, comes after prepositions. De ti, sobre ti, debajo de ti, encima de ti, etc.\n\nThis applies to all other first person, second, etc. So:\n\nYo, mi(s), me, m\u00ed\n\nT\u00fa, tu(s), te, ti\n\n\u00c9l/ella/usted, su(s), lo/la, le\n\nNosotros/as, nuestro/a(s), nos, nosotros/as\n\nVosotros/as, vuestro/a(s), os, vosotros/as\n\nEllos/ellas/ustedes, su(s), los/las, les\n\nProbably made a mistake somewhere.

Are you trying to ask if native speakers know how to pronounce every word? No! Yes, as native speakers we know how to pronounce most of the common words correctly, because it's the language we speak.

Phonemes represent sounds; those are just written letters.

Necesito quejarme de unas cosas lol. Estoy en la universidad y quiero seguir estudiando espa\u00f1ol, pero es que no me gustan las clases de espa\u00f1ol que se ofrecen. Me encanta la ling\u00fc\u00edstica, y ahora estoy tomando una clase de ling\u00fc\u00edstica espa\u00f1ola, pero despu\u00e9s de este semestre, no hay clases que me interesan. En la secundaria me encantaron las clases de espa\u00f1ol porque me fascina la gram\u00e1tica y aprender idiomas en general. Pero ahora las clases de espa\u00f1ol no tratan de aprender el idioma sino que tratan de usar la lengua para la literatura y la traducci\u00f3n y todo eso. Adem\u00e1s, es mucho trabajo escrito. En mis clases de espa\u00f1ol no tenemos oportunidades de realmente hablar sobre los temas. Extra\u00f1o el aspecto conversacional de mis clases de espa\u00f1ol. Y s\u00ed, hay unas clases ling\u00fc\u00edsticas (como la sintaxis y fon\u00e9tica), pero actualmente ning\u00fan profesor las ense\u00f1a. Creo que la raz\u00f3n por la que ning\u00fan profesor las ense\u00f1a actualmente es porque nadie quiere tomar una clase de la sintaxis espa\u00f1ola lol.
