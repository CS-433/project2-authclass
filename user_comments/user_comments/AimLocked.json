Which is why I recommended smaller lips and then the traditional chinese make-up where you just put lip make-up on the part of the lips, mainly just the center (and it looks kinda like tiny lips). Its very doll-like and elegant.\n\nAlso, with regards to Latin Americans, yall are different because you arent a racial or ethnic group. So yes, an Asian Latin American will look different from a Black one who will look different from a Quechua one. As this game is from China, she is most likely Han Chinese (as that is the 'most important' ethnic group in China and the majority class). Its also the one that oppresses and murders separates other ethnic groups, but we arent going to talk about that right now.\n\nRegardless of the fact, she does look Chinese, at least to me, except I feel her lips are too big. Especially given the Chinese beauty standard that \"Lips too big will eat up money earned by the husband\". Its something like that.

Where I live in Texas, many hispanic children cant speak Spanish even if their parents speak to them in Spanish from a young age. Or they are at a point where they can understand, but not respond (one-way bilingualism). Because they realize when they are little that it 'isnt necesary' only to grow up and wish they were able to speak Spanish.\n\nThere needs to be motivation and a perceieved reward for learning the language. For example, one mom bought her daughter a cat and said the cat can only speak (i think it was) Swedish. Naturally, the daughter wanted the kitten, so there was a perceieved reward and a motivation to speak Swedish.\n\nI think its just human nature to think something is unnecesary and ignore it. And that is smart from a biological standpoint. I.e. \"this is antiquated, we dont need this anymore\" idea. So there needs to be a conscious effort to counteract that. There should NEVER be any trouble raising your child to be bilingual if you get creative. People even raise their kids to be multilingual now, with one parent speaking one language to the kid, and the other another, a possible lingua franca the parents use while they are together, and maybe even a language used in the place they live. Thats 4 languages overall! (There is one couple I know in Germany, she speaks French, her Husband Spanish, and they speak to the kid and eachother in English, meanwhile at school the kid speaks in German).\n\nYoure not dumb for not picking up your moms language.
