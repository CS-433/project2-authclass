I don\u2019t mean intense in a bad way, but I was a younger college student for my previous ones, and it was a lot harder to imagine a future with another person when I wasn\u2019t really independent yet.

Everything is so solid and we work together very well. It requires effort, don\u2019t get me wrong, but I\u2019m very happy and fulfilled. We also started dating during a period of my life where I realized that I wanted to move to her country, so that is working out well for our relationship. I feel really secure having a trajectory that includes my partner, even if I don\u2019t have a settled timeline yet. \n\nWith my person, we\u2019d been close friends for months, and feelings grew steadily and organically. We have pretty much identical political and social values, and our life goals align really well. We get along really well and have similar interests while maintaining our own separate hobbies. Our relationship is very healthy and it\u2019s incredibly easy to communicate with her.\n\nWe\u2019ve been together for four months now and every day our relationship gets stronger.

Instead of focusing on how much I disliked my physical appearance, I tried to see what I liked about the gym and looked forward to those. Now I enjoy feeling like my body has done some work - I look forward to slight soreness. Even if I\u2019m not exercising regularly just yet, it helps me on \u201cokay\u201d days. \n\nI\u2019m trying to find things inherent to healthy activities and habits that are rewarding to me. Like the soreness with exercise, or the refreshing feeling that comes after a glass of water, or how relieved I feel when the dishes are done in a timely manner. I\u2019m trying to find pleasure in lots of small things instead of a few big changes, because I don\u2019t find that big changes stick as well for me. I know it sounds potentially trivializing, but reframing mindsets can be incredibly powerful. \n\nOverall, you made the first step. Awesome! The next day you plan to be at the gym you can make a second step, and on from there. You got this! \n\nHope that didn\u2019t sound too preachy, and as always with depression, YMMV!", "created_utc": "1581471463.0", "edited": "False", "id": "fhcv2ux", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_f2gqio", "parent_id": "t3_f2gqio", "score": "9", "subreddit": "EOOD", "subreddit_id": "t5_2zw1d"}, {"author": "lorayray", "body": "It can be a curse - I need to buy clothes more often because of sweat stains.

Learn how to flow. This is basically debate-speak for \"note-taking\". What I've found to be most effective is to take a blank printer sheet of paper and keep it portrait style in front of you (like you would write on a normal sheet of paper. DON'T turn it on its side.), and draw a line about an inch and a half away from the edge, and then a line right through the middle, splitting the page in half. Put their case on the bottom in the long box you've drawn yourself, and your case on the top (I always use different colors for different cases, it looks nice to me). For refutations, draw an arrow from the argument you're refuting to the argument you have against it. You can flow summaries and final focuses in the extra space you have (I'm considering drawing more lines to make more boxes, so it looks nicer. I'll do that when school starts :P) \n[Here](http://tinypic.com/r/otm2ad/5) is a picture of when I first started using this style, so it's a bit messy but you get the idea.\nAnother thing to note when looking at my flow is that I spell out waaay too many words. Eliminate unnecessary words and shorten necessary ones. This comes with practice. Start by flowing some of the videos you've watched before, you'll get the hang of it!\nSince PF isn't as jargon-intensive as some other styles, you'll need to learn how to make your own shorthand as the topics change. For example, \"hc\" was healthcare, \"hi\" was health insurance, \"hcp\" was healhcare providers, and so on. W/ = with, => = leads to, etc. Whatever makes the most sense to you.\n\n2. Look up the topic for Sept/Oct (they now have a topic for two month at the beginning! Yay! Don't get too used to this tough, since it normally changes every month). \n\n* a. Brainstorm arguments that you think might work well.\n\n* b. Google the exact resolution to see what other debate gurus think about this topic, and what arguments they might think are effective.\n\n* c. Compile evidence that you think may be useful.\n\nAlso: feel free to message me for help! I'm a senior in high school so I may get busy with college applications at the beginning, but I will try my best to get back to you. :)\n\nSource: Placed 3rd at State in PF the past two years, went to NFL Nats in Birmingham this past year.
