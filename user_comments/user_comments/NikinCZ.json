A child learns language nearly all of their awake time along with learning how to move (walk, use tools) and socialize. Yet if you speak to a 5yo, their language is crude. Now imagine an adult having the dedication, material means to learn systematically all of their awake time, no sense of shame, and also having native speakers to constantly talk to in the language patiently and correct them for 2 years. You can likely reach fluency in that time, especially if you're native or near-native in an Indo-European lang and learning another IE.

Yes, vaccinated people spread it onto others, studies are still not very clear on it but it seems more likely that it has almost no effect on spreading. What real-world statistics have shown however is that the number of people in hospitals who are unvaccinated is higher than those who are vaccinated, despite the numbers being opposite when you look at the entire population. One of the most important goals of vaccination is to prevent hospitals and healthcare workers from being over their capacity and being thus unable to care for both vaccinated and unvaccinated as well as those who have injuries or diseases other than covid.\n\nYes, it is definitely possible to go through covid unvaccinated and without symptoms. But it's less likely than if you are vaccinated. A friend of mine caught it before vaccines were widely available where I live over a year ago and to this date can't smell or taste very well. Personally, I don't think I would choose to drive on a road that has a 5% chance of going off rails and killing me. And if I did and survived, I wouldn't downplay the unlucky 5%.\n\nThe last claim I guess I'm somewhat wrong as it seems at least against new variants, going through the disease in the past is more effective (you can google that yourself I'm sure). But still, vaccines don't cause any long-lasting adverse effects for most people, especially none around the lungs, which covid kills through the most often. Yes, there are some people who were killed by the vaccine or had long-lasting effects. But the number is way lower than those who died of the covid itself.

But with romantic attraction?\n\nIt's very hard to describe. I'm trying to use friendship/platonic attraction as a baseline, but I'm finding it impossible to really describe how the two are different. It really comes down to just feeling it, however stupid that may sound to an aro brain (I know because that's how it always  sounded to me). But honestly romantic love is just a lot stronger. If I compare how I felt about my qpp before and how I feel about my romantic partner, it's just the feeling of wanting to spend every minute of my life with them. I am not a small talk kinda person but I can do it with my partner for hours and hours and when I stop to do something else, I can't help but want to continue. Also I want to do everything I can to overcome all differences. I think that with friends, you simply need a lot more overlap in interests and in how you think, whereas with partner, the love connects you even through larger differences.
