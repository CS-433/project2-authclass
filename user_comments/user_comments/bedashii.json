Which hero do you enjoy playing the most? Which types of decks do you like (aggro, tempo, combo, etc)? Once you've figured that out you can start aiming and saving for the deck you'd like to build.\n\nI suggest creating a [Hearthtpwn](http://hearthpwn.com/) account and downloading the [Inkeeper App](http://www.innkeeper.com/) (this only works if you do it from a PC, sorry). You can then search for decks on HearthPwn and filter out the decks you don't have the cards for.\n\nIf you're fairly confident going back to arena that would be the best way to build your collection 'cos you'll always get more value if you manage to go at least 3+ wins. \n\nI be too concerned about what the best decks on ladder are right now as knowing this (or even playing these decks) might not help you much while you're still learning most of the fundamentals of the game. glhf", "created_utc": "1478175423.0", "edited": "False", "id": "d9judho", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_5awa35", "parent_id": "t3_5awa35", "score": "8", "subreddit": "hearthstone", "subreddit_id": "t5_2w31t"}, {"author": "bedashii", "body": "Sometimes its a good thing to get some of the old ones.

Classic Muslim married to a Christian story. She was abandoned by her entire family because I refused to turn Muslim (father even had me at my throat at some point, I just turned the other cheek *ain't nobody got time for that).\n\nJust getting to this point (one could say) was already half the battle. We (and by \"we\" I mean she) almost broke up (with me) several times before we got married. She even called off the wedding on our wedding day (was supposed to get married October 31, actually got married December 19). It was a tough decision for her because losing your entire family, especially when you're not actually losing them (they're just turning their backs' on you) is immensely difficult.\n\nReason I never let go, she has never been happier than she is now. Today she's (and be \"she\" I mean we) in a marriage where she can be herself. This is the person I want/ed to be with and I never doubted it. We figured that marriage is a difficult thing no matter what. Just because it's more \"convenient\" (and not really for us but for other people) doesn't make it better or easier. \n\nTL;DR - Get married because you make each other happy.
