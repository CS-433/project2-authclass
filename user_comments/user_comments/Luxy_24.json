You can make up words and people can understand them without knowing them. Also the language sounds really nice. It can be harsh and soft - doesn't matter. Plus the huge amount of literature and culture that opens up to you once you know the language is just amazing. I particulary enjoy Nachkriegsliteratur which is something you can't really find in other languages (at least from my experience). German is also my prefered language for watching Youtube and Twitch and whatever!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFRENCH: French is amazing because it sounds beautiful. The words and sentences flow in a way that I haven't experienced in any other language I know. Also the depth of vocabulary that you encounter when reading French literature is just astounding. Knowing French, again, opens up so so much literature and history to read and I just love it. I don't really like the grammar part but oh well...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nJAPANESE: My Japanese isn't very good but from what I have studied there is a lot to love. The pronounciation is baffingly easy and pretty. I particulary enjoy the Kanji even if they're a pain in the ass to remember. Writing Japanese is very fun but a bit exhausting after some time. Japanese also opens up so much stuff like videogames and TV series and movies, however I'm not able to enjoy that just yet :<\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSPANISH: I have learned Spanish to a pretty good degree in a short amount of time due to me already speaking French. I love the way it sounds and it is just a joy to speak and write. It may even be the most fun I've had writing in a foreign language tbh. I'm still a newbie but I'm very commited to study more and fast because Spanish is extremely useful when looking internationally. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nENGLISH: I like English but I'm not that fond of it. I think it sounds fairly good and the grammar isn't that difficult. However being proficient in English is super useful and opens up the world in terms of media and communication. It is simply the most useful language to learn.

This was a very powerful moment because the viewer also probably had fond memories of this place and like Honoka thought back at what went down there. \n\nFurthermore I think something that nobody mentioned here, but what also didn\u2019t help in giving the school in Sunshine more significance for me, is that Mari was the director. Why?? Why couldn\u2019t it have been her father? It would\u2019ve made the whole situation so much more interesting and believable.

Well written and argumented review. I like Aquors and the episodes were fun but there were some things that really bugged me. Especially point 3 is something I will not get over.\nAquors won this Love Live not because they deserved and earned it through hard training and dedication but just because the plot demanded it. We pretty much never saw them train together, we didnt see how they got more popular over time, like Muse, and we only got one episode where they searched ideas for a new song. In my opinion they dont deserve the victory from what we have seen.\n\nIn addition the build-up for the Love Live was incredibly weak. When I watched episode 12 I suddenly remembered that this anime was also about the Love Live competition and not only about the school closing down.\n\nI was primarely disappointed in this season because I reeeeeally love season 1 of Sunshine. For me this was the perfect introduction to these characters and season 2 destroyed so much of this. The characters were just too uninteressting for me for the most part. After season1 I liked all members of Aquors with Yoshiko being my favourite. Now I hate Chika (I want to shiiiiiine wtf), I dont like Mari anymore because of her Engrish and I think s2 made Yoshiko into a joke. \n\nBut of course not everything in this season is bad. The animation and CGI were amaaazing and Ruby and Dia as well as Saint Snow really stood out. I would rate the season a 6/10. For comparison Sunshine s1 is a 9/10 for me, SIP s1 a 9.5/1 and SIP s2 a 10/10. \n\n I also made a similar post were go a bit more into detail about my critizism: https://www.reddit.com/r/LoveLive/comments/7n8xtu/some_things_that_bugged_me_in_sunshine_season_2/\n\n", "created_utc": "1515236225.0", "edited": "1515238190.0", "id": "ds9rank", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_7oii9e", "parent_id": "t3_7oii9e", "score": "13", "subreddit": "LoveLive", "subreddit_id": "t5_31qlw"}, {"author": "Luxy_24", "body": "\u201eIt\u2018s high.

I mentioned in my comment above mostly the same points (although not nearly as well detailed and written as your comments) but I have to disagree that Nico is even slightly as annoying as Yoshik.. oh sorry I forgot, Yohane of course xDDDDDD... anyways \n\nNico, while being a comic relief character,  has an actual character. She cares by far the most about the whole idol thing and when shit gets serious she doesn't joke around. When Muse disbanded in s1 SHE was the one to continue. She was the one to freak out when Honoka left. She was the one who bawled the most when it was decided that Muse will disband after the Love Live. Nico is a damaged person: Her partners left her during her first try at being a school idol. She had major problems at not being the center and leader in Muse and lied to her whole family because of it. Muse saved her and we see this. Without Muse she wouldn't have graduated and would've still been a loner probably. \n\nNow compare this with Yoshiko. Her motivation to join Aquors? She wanted to make friends. Fine, I guess. But did we ever see that she even cared about this whole idol thing? About the school? Probably she did care but we didn't see it. What we instead got was a shell of an amazing character in s1 (she was my favorite before s2). She could've been removed from Aquors completely and the season would've played out the exact same way because she wasn't important in any way. \n\n", "created_utc": "1515016940.0", "edited": "1515017317.0", "id": "ds5cw43", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_7npggr", "parent_id": "t1_ds4illo", "score": "11", "subreddit": "LoveLive", "subreddit_id": "t5_31qlw"}, {"author": "Luxy_24", "body": "Chika got character development?

It is pretty much non existent outside of the episode with the puppy. She was basically reduced to saying some weird satanic mumbo jumbo and the usual catch phrase. I didn\u2019t understand why she was even sad that the school was closing because we didn\u2019t saw her give one shit about it in the whole season (I\u2019m sorry if I forgot a scene but I can\u2019t recall any) \n\nNico is a good example of how a comic relief character can still be entertaining and deep at the same time. She had this whole conflict going on inside her because she wanted to be the center and leader. In addition she was damaged by her previous try at being a school idol which gave her an identity and she had no friends prior to season 1, the same as Yoshiko, but there were actually episodes which focused on this in both season of SIP whereas this topic is very rarely brought up with Yoshiko. \n\nI\u2019m sorry but I\u2019m just so disappointed with Yoshiko in season 2.
