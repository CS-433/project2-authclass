With E you are pretty much guaranteeing proccing your runes and harassing your opponents because most won't expect the E start.\n\nI agree with starting Q against melee champions, it's definitely a good idea but wouldn't recommend the same against ranged champions.

Or the ones that can quickly trigger Electrocute like Ahri and Vex.\n\nAnd since I don't play in LCS or anything, my opponents' laning knowledge aren't great and I don't need to shove my lane faster by starting Q. Also E start doesn't really slow your hard pushes by a lot. It's only around 1.5 seconds. And you spend more mana by spamming Q as opposed to using E once or even twice in some cases (E can be cheaper than Q because you'll be triggering manaflow alongside hitting all the minions in the wave).\n\nIf you played coordinated 5v5s, scrims, tournaments, clash. You would know that starting E helps in some situations. As opposed to Q. I agree that Q is better in extended fights, but starting E can be better if you want to burn enemies' spells/block their engage.

As for my elo, I was Grandmaster in flex last season, I only play from clash to clash. Also, I'm sure you have more experience with the new Taliyah compared to me because I haven't played LOL as much as I played last season.\n\nWhat do you think about E start? Q start seems useless against a lot of long-range mages like Viktor. The high mana cost doesn't make a huge difference considering you'll gain back all the mana you spent when you hit level 2. Of course, this depends from matchup to matchup but as I said, you don't want to get pushed in against champions like Syndra, Viktor, or Xerath since they can easily harass you under tower so I find that starting E helps (both with harassing them and not getting pushed in).\n\nAlso, you can proc Manaflow, First Strike, and Scorch if you are using them. Whereas it's much more difficult with Q to proc these runes at level 1 because enemies tend to hide behind their minions. And not only that, mages like Viktor usually hit you first before you can hit your Q on them even if you manage to find an angle where you can Q them.\n\nI start E 65% of the time because I'm usually against these types of champions. Even if I'm against assassins, there are games I still start E and slowpush for the crab fight.\n\nAnd for Archangel's, I don't like purchasing it. I feel like it hurts my damage, I try to play the new Taliyah just like the old Taliyah. I play her as a burst mage, not a control mage (not always, I play like a control mage in some fights when I need to give my teammates room to play). I like to pick up Shadowflame or even early Deathcap instead of Archangles. In fact, I don't buy tear on Taliyah, I don't have any issues with mana. Maybe I'm used to it, that could be the reason. I don't even purchase Archangle's on Cassiopeia, I don't like the new Archangle's in general. What do you think about skipping Archangle's?\n\nAlso lastly, I like going Celerity, Waterwalking in games where I think I will play with my jungler a lot even though they nerfed Taliyah's passive in the early game.

That champion exists, and it's Taliyah.\n\nAnd on top of all that, she is a flex pick. You can play her in the jungle with similar results.

I personally don't like toplane in general, hence why I play her mid. I feel insignificant as a toplaner, I can't impact other lanes unless I'm okay with losing 3 plates, 2+ waves every time I tp bot. Even though her midlane matchups are worse than toplane, I still prefer her in the mid lane. She is a skirmisher (you need to force fights), you need to play with your jungler (which you can do easily if you are mid laner, unlike other lanes).\n\nFor APC, if you have friends that play Nautilus, Leona etc. (engage supports), go ahead, I highly recommend it. My APC bot lane Cassiopeia winrate is significantly higher than my winrate in the other lanes (you can check my League of Graphs profile, you'll see it there).

Barrier is very nice on Cassiopeia, you can bait people and do 1v2s, 1v3s depending on the circumstance (you should only go TP against Xerath in my opinion).\n\nI haven't tried the new mythic items this season but if they have 2 tanks or more, you should go Liandry's as your mythic item. I personally ban zed, but Xerath ban is more reasonable, Xerath matchup is literally unplayable. Other than that, Archangels, Zhonyas, and Cosmic are great items on Cassiopeia, you should buy those most games. I see that you got Rylai's, some people like it, but not me. It's preference of course, if you like using it, then keep it. But I suggest you try her without Rylai's, catching up to your opponents isn't difficult with Cassio with the help of your passive movement speed, Cosmic Drive movement speed and Q movement speed steroid buff you get. I'd rather get more defensive items such as Banshee's, Zhonya's in this case (I saw that you didn't buy Zhonya's this game, Kayn could've killed you easily, you should buy Zhonya's in a game like this, for the most part you should buy it most games).\n\nConqueror didn't get a huge nerf in my opinion (don't forget to take Last Stand), you are fine with keeping Conqueror, but besides Conqueror, the only rune you could use is Phase Rush. In fact you should use Phase Rush in control mage matchups such as Syndra, Xerath, Vel'koz, Orianna.\n\nIf you have trouble against control mages you should take Phase Rush alongside Minion dematerializer and put 3 points into your Q before maxing E. Just shove the lane, or keep the lane in the middle. NEVER EVER GET SHOVED IN BY CONTROL MAGES!!!, you'll lose so much farm by having to go back to base because of their constant poke towards you when you are under tower. If you can get away with pushing the lane and not dying to ganks, do it all the time (if they have champions that have poor ganks such as Master Yi). If you push the lane into control mages, they can not poke you down because they have to deal with minions under the tower and for many of them it's difficult to farm under the tower, unlike Cassiopeia.\n\nBut other matchups, such as assassins and characters like Yone/Yasuo, keep the wave towards your side close to your tower, it shouldn't be a problem considering most assassins and Yone/Yasuo players shove without having much thought into minion wave management.\n\nIf you want to see how I play and what I build etc. Here is my profile, you can take a look.
