AFAIK there is some Catalan content out there but it's dwarfed by the amount in Portuguese. How much that matters depends on your learning style. It sounds like you've got a pretty good grasp on the realities of both languages, you just need to decide what matters more to you.\n\nMe personally, I'd value the content and opportunities to practice much more highly, so I'd pick Portuguese, unless there was a high chance I was going to live in Catalunya or Andorra soon. Even then, I might just wait until I arrive. Until you go there, you're very unlikely to find speakers to practice with.\n\nI'd also add, you're only at an A2 level, so your likelihood of mixing up the languages when you start speaking is much higher. Since Spanish and Catalan are so close grammatically, lexically, and phonetically, I think that will count against you and potentially lead to mixing up the languages in the early stages.

Check the link in the comment from AutoModerator.\n\nLearning a language is mostly the same regardless of your end goal, especially at the start, so it is best to learn in a way that works for you. A lot of people choose to do classes because they need motivation. Others are learning for fun and are self motivated, so they do it solo. The language is the same either way, but there's no one-size-fits-all way to get the language into your brain. I personally would not recommend college language classes as a way to learn - people frequently come out of those with poor communication skills.\n\nIf you take a job that requires a language, they will generally want certification or some other kind of demonstrable proof. You don't have to do classes for this, but you probably do need to take a well-accepted test like DELE, likely C1 or C2. You'll probably need the certification even if you do classes. You demonstrate proficiency in your native language through your CV and interviewing, you may need to do the same for your language if you have no qualification, and even then they might inisit on a cert if you are not a native. It all depends on your particular path and role.\n\nIf you want to use a language in a career, how good you need to be depends on the career. If you want to do interpreting, you need to be VERY good, and often in multiple languages, and learn to be an interpreter on top. Translating documents might demand less, but you will still need to be certified at a high level for the langauge you are translating to. Just be warned, in neither of these feilds should work be taken for granted. There are a lot of bi- and tri-linguals out there.\n\nHope that helps. I eventually decided not to pursue languages as a career, so I can only tell you from my experience learning languages and reading a lot here.

In the deck they're just random words/phrases without too much indication of how useful remembering them actively will be for me (except for frequency, obviously).\n\nIf you're looking to improve your speaking, and aren't using lots of content, NL -> TL cards are a good way to improve faster. They're also the best way if you use a card to learn grammar, since the other way round is too easy just to understand from context without learning it properly. If you do drop them you will probably notice you struggle to use the words you learn (at least initially). Both ways have their merits, so it's really up to you how to learn. My general rule is, if I like a word and want to know/use it, or I want to absorb the way it is used (espeically important when it's not used the same way as its English equivalent), I will learn it NL -> TL to make sure I know it and can produce said usage. Otherwise if I just want to catch the meaning while reading, TL -> NL all the way. Those words make it to your active vocabulary over time anyway.\n\nIf you want to keep both, you could try keeping them and experimenting with changing the Anki deck's starting ease, say from 250% to 300% or 350%.

I hope that will make you feel like it's a little less obvious than you are protraying it as, because looking at his ears is what makes me doubt it most of all. \n\nNote that ears sit quite far back from the face, so the angle you're looking at someone can substantially alter their apparent height and size. I'm comparing using the second photo where he appears to be looking at a newspaper with the guy in this YT video. I ignored the clapping picture because it doesn't even show anything, so whether it's him or not is irrelevent. At 2:31 in the YT video he turns to the left, and the shape of his inner ear is quite clearly the same as the guy in the photo. I wouldn't agree that the guy's ears stick out high above where they are attached to his head - I'm really not sure what you're seeing, but there definitely is a spot where they angle outwards that is not visible in the photo. That can be explained by the fact that his head is quite far angled to the side, so that extrusion is pointing towards the camera, concealing it. You'll notice when he turns his head it becomes less apparent.\n\nThe other reason I doubt it is how oddly frank the people in the video were. It seems odd to me that three PoWs would sit there and destroy their chance of ever going home to see their family, let alone doing it so calmly, when they could have just kept quiet.\n\nIn favour of it being genuine: the same twitter handle didn't even provide their own source of the photos - so point against them.  Also, even if it is the same person, all it shows is this guys was at an Azov-associated event. Maybe he is exactly who he says he his and also is the guy in the photo because he has Ukrainian family. That would likely give him Ukrainian sympathies and make him more likely to do something like this.\n\nOverall, the evidence there is enough to make me doubt this video is geniune, though it doesn't change my opinion about the war. I'd love it if you were right, since I don't there to be Ukrainians making false videos, but the idea that the Azov guys might get together and fake a PoW confession doesn't strike me as a wild unlikelihood. Remember that, at best, these guys' story is still completely unverified.

That would be a smart choice because people take \"fluent\" to mean pretty much whatever they want, so it's very easy for one person to say he's 100% fluent and another to say he's not even close.\n\nWhat I did see from scanning this dude's video is he seemed to be using 7-5 year old videos as evidence of Olly's current ability, which strikes me as at the least unfair. From the languages I know it looks to me like Olly definitely can speak the languages he claims to, and I don't see any problem with him not being perfect.
