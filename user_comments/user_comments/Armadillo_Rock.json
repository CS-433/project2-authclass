But FWIW:\n\nI struggled with something similar, especially wrt my bum. My body is sort of a mix between [banana and pear shape](https://www.belletag.com/fashion/style-guide/jean-guide-how-to-find-best-jeans-for-your-body-type), and my bum kind of stands out relative to my overall proportions. For a long time, I had no idea how to dress modestly \"enough\" without looking too baggy.\n\nOne thing that I realized is that [A line skirts](https://aliexpress.com/item/32897883645.html) made me look frumpy.

It look some trial and error to find pencil skirts that are just loose enough to not do this.\n\nIf you're completely stuck, my advice would be: make a list of as many different types of pants, skirts, dresses, and/or tops as you possibly can. (If you don't know any fashion/style-related vocab, use the internet to help you. You can google e.g. \"types of skirts\" to get ideas). Then set aside some time, and do some trips to the mall. Find several pieces of each \"style\" (e.g. several different pencil skirts, or several different asymmetrical dresses - whatever it is), and try them on. What works (and why)? What doesn't? \n\nSince this is a trial thing (you don't have to buy anything yet), you can even try on pieces that seem like they might be *just a bit* not modest enough. After all, you can always take note - \"this looks super cool on me, but it's bit too revealing, how can I adjust it just a tad to make it more modest?\"\n\nDoing all of this with a fashion stylist could (potentially) save you time, but would cost money.\n\nGood luck!!

It Includes both \"daily\" content (e.g. hobbies) and also memories of escaping the war in Syria and being refugees.\n\nLook through the [Levantine Arabic resource page](https://lingualism.com/product-category/arabic/levantine-arabic/) on lingualism - they have lots more cool stuff, including Anki decks and short novellas (with accompanying audio) in Levantine.\n\nReally hope this helps!

I could read about something, and look at pictures, a million times and still be unable to memorize it.\n\nTo this day, I can remember almost everything I hear and learn words instantly by hearing them.

Keep immersing yourself in Hebrew. It's amazing that you're already doing this, because it will help you get used to the sounds of the language. When I started out, I also watched a lot of [Arthur episodes in Hebrew](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%D7%90%D7%A8%D7%AA%D7%95%D7%A8). Amazing cartoon and it was fun to watch, even though I didn't understand anything (yet).  \n\n2. I liked [this series](https://www.amazon.com/Hebrew-Language-Course-Level-English/dp/0874413311/) (there are 3 books in total). Some of the texts are a bit dry and it doesn't come with an audio component (but your gf can help you with pronunciation). **But**, it has the best explanations of grammar that I've ever seen. It will seriously make your life a lot easier by helping you master verbs (which are super logical in Hebrew).  \n\n3. I used [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) a lot. It's an app where you can create flashcards and then review them over time. But it gets even better - based on how easy or hard each card is for you, Anki uses statistical data to decide when/how often you should see that card next. It is designed to only show you each card right before you're about to forget it (permanently).. A very powerful tool for committing things to your long-term memory.   \nSome people use Anki to review individual words, but I highly recommend making fill-in-the blank sentences. For example, on the \"front\" side, writing \"\u05d0\u05ea\u05d4 \\_\\_\\_ \u05d0\u05e0\u05d2\u05dc\u05d9\u05ea?\" and then on the \"back\" side, \u05de\u05d3\u05d1\u05e8 / medaber (with the transliteration). Doing it this way will help you learn words **in context**, which is important.   \n\n4. Pop music is also a fun way to learn! [This website](https://lyricstranslate.com/) has a lot of transliterations and translations of Hebrew pop songs into English. Your gf can probably recommend some artists, but if you want, we (on this sub-reddit) can, too. \ud83d\ude42\n\nGood luck!

That is an actual problem.\n\nYes, it is a problem, and I empathize with Russia's neighbors on that point.

Most Westerners also wouldn't tolerate people saying things like \"all Muslims are terrorists.\" We understand that each Muslim is an individual person and that many of them are decent people, despite the big, cultural issues from those countries.\n\nSo why is it different with Russians? Yes, Russia has issues. It's a (mostly poor) country that has always had lots of corruption and has never been a true democracy. Some aspects of the Russian mentality are less civilized the West.\n\nThat doesn't make it OK to generalize about all Russians. Or to drool over the thought of them all getting killed.\n\nIn your first comment, you compared \\~140 million people to the Taliban. Do you stand by that comment?  \n\n\n>I don't support any civillian or military getting killed because of a deranged madman.\n\nIf you support locking all Russians in a country where they're going to be sent as cannon fodder to Ukraine... yeah, you're arguing for them to be killed. \n\nDid you not realize this before?  \n\n\n>Btw, just as a side note, don't you think it's fascinating that Russians travel to Crimea on vacation this year just like every summer and then flee back to Russia,\n\nI have family that have been desperately trying to get out of Russia for months and literally haven't not been able to (because of bureaucracy). There are now rumours that they're going to forbid all men from leaving the country by Sept 30, and there's no way my family can get out before then. They're going to have to hide and hope that they don't get ~~ground up and shit out of the war machine~~ conscripted.\n\nI don't give a fuck about the minority of Russians who can afford to travel anywhere on a whim.

(If there aren't any in your city, you can also find an online tutor via [Italki](https://www.italki.com).) Start with the alphabet, if you haven't already done that. Then go through an actual, proper course that will teach you grammar in detail and also expose you to way more vocabulary. I personally used and loved [this one](https://www.amazon.com/Hebrew-Language-Course-Level-English/dp/0874413311/) (there are 3 books in the series), but you can find different options if you type things like \"learn Hebrew\" into the Amazon search bar.\n\nWhatever course you chose, work through it with your tutor.\n\nStart listening to Hebrew - [it takes time for the sounds of a new language to seep into our brain](https://www.linguanaturalis.com/en/blogs/how-to-master-a-language-for-life/3-reasons-listening-is-the-most-important-skill-to-tackle-first/?language=en). A fun, beginner-friendly way to do this is to listen to music (since you can enjoy music even if you don't understand 100%). If you don't know any Israeli artists, search in this sub and also in r/Israel for keywords like \"Israeli bands\", \"Israeli artists\", \"music\" etc. Find songs that you like, and then look up the lyrics + English translation on [lyricstranslate.com](https://lyricstranslate.com). Try to \"figure out\" each sentence and see which words you can pick out. At first, it might be just 1-2 words per song, but everyone has to start somewhere. And you can have fun getting into the music and getting used to the sounds of Hebrew.\n\nThere's a lot more you can do when you get to an intermediate phase - google or Youtube search \"how to learn vocab better\" etc. There's also nothing wrong with using Duolingo per se, but it's a snack - not a main dish.

Haifa has bars, it has dancing events, it has a million activities that you can join (I've signed up for parkour and improv acting classes).

At least in religious communities, going to church/mosque/whatever makes people socialize (and donate to charity).\n\nThen there's the lack of family values. When I was in high school, I heard of (white) kids whose parents let them smoke weed and sleep over with a bf/gf... at age 15. Now that we're 30, a lot of these same kids hate their parents (or cut off ties with them) for the dumbest reasons. \"My mom told me to lose weight once, she wants me ANOREXIC!\" \"My dad walked into my room without knocking once, that's raping my boundaries!!!\" (Immigrant kids: \"... you have your own room?\")\n\nNo appreciation for the people who gave them life. It's all me, me, me.\n\nI left Canada but when I look back on it, I think of a dying country with no passion or soul for anything. White Canadians aren't even having kids, they're begging immigrants to come so their population doesn't dive down. I'm honestly convinced a large minority of Zoomer kids are inventing new genders because they're just **bored**. Canadians have turned all this left-wing BS into a new (really sh\\*tty) religion to the replace the old-school ones.\n\nAlso:\n\n1. It's true that secular countries are richer and religious countries are poorer, but correlation isn't causation. It could just be that poor people care about religion more (since it gives them psychological comfort) and then, when they become rich, they ditch religion. To their detriment, imo... look at how degenerate the West has become.\n2. There are lots of genuinely good religious people, communities, practices. The problem isn't with all religion, it's with people who are fanatical and egotistical about any ideology (whether it's religion or politics). Because when you use \"I'm a Muslim/Christian/left-wing/right-wing/whatever\"(TM) as an egotistical thing, you suddenly want to prove that you're better than someone else, or you want to force them to be more like you. So you start using violence. Communists and fascists both had (have) the same problem, even both groups are secular.", "created_utc": "1640860298.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hqj5fjf", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_rqg7xa", "parent_id": "t3_rqg7xa", "score": "2", "subreddit": "jordan", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qkq7"}, {"author": "Armadillo_Rock", "body": "Replace \"berries\" in this with \"mushrooms\"...\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KavHBokm704", "created_utc": "1640854707.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hqiyd7p", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_rru5vn", "parent_id": "t1_hqin8hk", "score": "3", "subreddit": "interestingasfuck", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhsa"}, {"author": "Armadillo_Rock", "body": "I'm an FG and not an expert on typing, but your body reminds me of mine (before I put on Corona weight).", "created_utc": "1640853803.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hqix7h3", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_rrtqjz", "parent_id": "t3_rrtqjz", "score": "2", "subreddit": "Kibbe", "subreddit_id": "t5_22m7gw"}, {"author": "Armadillo_Rock", "body": "Nah, I'm pretty happy haha.\n\nAlso, this sub is full of people born in rich countries who spend their adult lives working in retail/waitressing.

Because if you're looking for a guy 35 or under who already doesn't watch it... you're probably going to be single forever.

If you immediately start off with \"your habit is hurting someone else!!!\" people are just going to get defensive.\n\nI'm part of a religious community where people really value family. So my plan is to start with something like, \"have you ever thought about some of these women (in porn), who they are and how they got there?\" and things like \"how would you feel if your sister/mom/someone started doing porn?\" I think that's a good place to start because no decent man is going to say \"I'd be totally fine if they did that.\" (If he does say that - RUN!!)\n\nAt some point, I will also watch \"Hot Girls Wanted\" (available on Netflix) with the right guy.

Listening to Hebrew, all the time. (Even before I could understand anything - it's important to [give your brain time for all the sounds to seep in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4lyNDbgqsB0).) You can even have stuff on in the background while you work or do other things. Israeli radio: [https://radio.coolsite.co.il/](https://radio.coolsite.co.il/)\n2.

(It's amazing how they make Hebrew grammar so simple!)\n3. Watching shows in Hebrew when I have time. I started with [Arthur episodes](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%D7%90%D7%A8%D7%AA%D7%95%D7%A8) (on YouTube) - simple plot, simple vocab. I've since gotten into more science fiction and other stuff: **Sdarot dot tv** (URL) has a lot of Israeli shows online for free.Kan (\u05db\u05d0\u05df) also has a lot of amazing news and documentaries available on YouTube, but you will need a VPN for those.\n4. [Downloading Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) on my phone. It's an app (also available for computers/laptops) where you can make flashcards. Every time you answer a flashcard, it collects data about how well you remember that card, and calculates the best time (how many days later) to show you that card again so that you are statistically less likely to forget the information.\n\nI make flashcards for whole sentences (with a fill-in-the-blank), e.g. on the front I'll have something like:\n\n\"He speaks Hebrew\"\n\n\u05d4\u05d5\u05d0 \\_\\_ \u05e2\u05d1\u05e8\u05d9\u05ea\n\nAnd the back of the card:\n\n\u05de\u05d3\u05d1\u05e8\n\nmedaber\n\n\\~\\~\\~\n\nI use Anki to drill both vocab words (always in the context of a sentence) and verb conjugations.

I'm willing to look at any hard stats you can provide.\n\nOne of the goals of the Nordic Model is to encourage people to leave the sex trade, period. That's why services to help people leave and find other work is an important part of the deal; if the Nordic Model in France is pushing more women into very extreme poverty, then that sounds like something has gone with this part of the(ir implementation of) the model.\n\nFor the model to \"work\", many things have to be done, including police training on how to deal with prostitution without harming people in the sex trade itself. If a country doesn't train/educate the police on that, or if the police just don't GAF and don't follow any rules, then yes, it can lead to problems. This is also a potential problem if (for example) the Nordic Model were implemented in poorer countries with obvious police corruption.   \n\n\n> demand doesn't vanish when you make something illegal. \n\nI'm aware of this, and FWIW, I don't do utopias, nor do I think that the Nordic Model is a utopian solution.\n\nBut the rates of brothel-going men do vary from country to country, which destroys the argument that \"this is just some biological thing that we can't do anything about.\" We can do something about - we can make buying-sex \"uncool\" and reduce the amount of men (and couples) doing it through education.  \n\n\n> most sex worker organizations do not support it. \n\n  \nTrue, but then, most of these organizations really do not represent the vast majority of people in the sex trade. For example, less than 1% of the 500,00+ people in the sex trade in Germany have ever joined the unions/organizations that claim to represent them; in many places, the people running these organizations have all turned out to just be profiting from other people.

Which brings me to:\n\n**Anki sentences.** Like I said, I get full sentences from shows and other media, and put them into Anki.

I don't try to memorize these sentences, but I do also practice writing out each sentence by hand, in a notebook.\n\nWhy do it this way? Because it's a good way to learn words in context. (I never study isolated words in a vocab list!) And as you can see from the examples above, you can use this format to study anything - individual words, verbs in conjugated forms, prepositions. This is anecdotal, but I've used this sentence method for another language (before Hebrew), and I find that it really helps me internalize the structure of a language, in a much deeper way than e.g. just trying to memorize grammar charts.\n\n**Last but not least:** if I'm watching something in Hebrew, how do I know which sentence to add to Hebrew?\n\nShort answer: I try to look for something that's n+1, n being my current level. In other words, it has to be only very slightly outside my current level of knowledge. A good example would a sentence that has just 1 new vocab word. Or a sentence where I understand all of the verbs, but there's some verb conjugation in it that I want to review. Or I understand the sentence, but it uses a preposition that I wouldn't have used if I were trying to speak Hebrew myself. Anything that's just a little bit new or surprising.\n\nWhen you're a total beginner, it might be hard to find a sentence like this, because almost every sentence you come across will mostly be new words. (And I don't recommend adding things where every single word is completely new - it can feel overwhelming). In that case, you can also start with phrases, e.g.\n\n\"to ride a bicycle\"\n\n\u05dc\u05e8\u05db\u05d5\u05d1 \u05e2\u05dc \\_\\_\\_\n\n(Back/answer)  \n\u05d0\u05d5\u05e4\u05e0\u05d9\u05d9\u05dd  \nlirkov al OFANAIM\n\n\\~  \nBut the idea is to gradually keep branching out from your current level, stacking one more brick at a time as you build your Hebrew house.\n\nI hope all of this makes sense!

In that case, you can also start with phrases, e.g. \n\n\"to ride a bicycle\"\n\n\u05dc\u05e8\u05db\u05d5\u05d1 \u05e2\u05dc \\_\\_\\_  \n\n\n(Back/answer)  \n\u05d0\u05d5\u05e4\u05e0\u05d9\u05d9\u05dd  \nlirkov al OFANAIM\n\n\\~   \nBut the idea is to gradually keep branching out from your current level, stacking one more brick at a time as you build your Hebrew house.\n\nI hope all of this makes sense!

Ex-vegan, used to eat a very low-calorie diet until recently (1,200 a day) for weight maintenance. Had to change that recently when I finally started getting closer to 30 miles per week.\n\nMy tips:\n\n1. Avoid dry, very high fiber foods like oatmeal. They don't have as many calories as you think and you don't need THAT much fiber.\n\n2. You can get in some more calories via your drinks. If you don't have the time or energy to make your own juices, you can buy store bought juices - just make sure they really are 100% fruit and don't have tons of added crap. (IME, carrot juice is one of the easier juices to find a pure, healthy version of.)\n\n3. Healthy and high calorie snack ideas: nuts, dried fruits, crackers or bread sticks with hummus/guac/other high calorie thing. Dark chocolate. I personally love dates.\n\n4. If you don't already, now is a good time to add some high-quality salad dressing (or just extra-virgin olive oil) to your salads.\n\n5. Tortillas, flat breads, and soft taco \"shells\" are an easy way to get in lots of necessary carbs without immediately making you full (the way regular bread does.)\n\n6. There's nothing wrong having waffles or pancakes for breakfast. I used to shun both (because I saw them as too processed, or didn't want to cook with oil, in the case of pancakes).\n\nBut seriously... forget this mentality. You need your calories, and you can even buy whole wheat waffles, or make your own pancakes (some of my faves are banana pancakes and sweet potato pancakes).\n\nThese things are a great source of carbs, they don't have the fiber problem of oatmeal, and you can peanut butter and jam to them, sprinkled walnuts, etc.\n\n~~\n\nFWIW, I cook twice a week and freeze/refrigerate food to eat over the course of days.

What exact software do they use? What exactly can do they do with that software? What other (concrete) skills do they have? Do they have a portfolio (and if so, what makes some portfolios stand out)?   \nUse this search to get a concrete list of everything you would need to learn (or create) in order to start applying for these entry-level jobs.\n3. If you aren't already ready to start applying, then work on whatever skills (or software tools) you need to in order to get there. Schedule a specific time (or several times) in the day when you're going to start. Stick to your schedule religiously. Put in the hours.\n4. If that last step is really hard for you, maybe considering signing up for some (virtual?) courses where attendance matters. Find a way to stick to your schedule and get the work done.\n5. In the meantime, try to see if there is any free work that you could do for a portfolio. Do you have friends who could use a Photoshop job (going with the \"graphic designer\" example)? Maybe do something for them.   \nHeck, even ask around - people in your immediate friends circle might not need anything, but maybe they know someone else who does.  \nAlso, another idea - is there a local business that you love to pieces, but that you're worried might not survive financially in light of Corona? Get in touch with them and ask if you can do a free/volunteer gig with them. You get something for your portfolio, they get something that helps their business.\n6. This is an optional step, but if you seriously have no friends (to help promote you, etc.), maybe consider getting some social media and starting to promote your work there? While you're working on your portfolio.\n7. When you're not learning or working on your portfolio, find other things to keep you busy during Corona. Don't sit around and indulge your own thoughts - use this time to get in touch with old friends, watch movies / read books, try to take care of your physical health (even if it's just eating slightly less junk each day), etc.  \nI don't think you can succeed in creative fields long-term if you become too myopic and one-track about the work itself.

The point of modesty is to create a barrier between your beauty and every man who isn't your husband - and a wig accomplishes that.\"\n\nLet's break this down a little. \n\nI agree that the point of modesty shouldn't be to try avoid all scenarios where a man might get aroused by you. I don't even know if you CAN avoid that! Some people just have dirty minds, or they might be attracted to you for subconscious reasons. No wardrobe or behaviours can totally prevent that from happening.\n\nBUT I also think that the end of the day, some aspects of a woman (her body, voice, hair) are either sensual or not. And if they're sensual, and we agree that part of modesty = not putting our sensuality on display... then we just shouldn't be putting those things on display. Even in a fake format.\n\nIf hair can be sensual, so can a wig.\n\nTo me, wearing a wig over your real hair is arguably like wearing your bra on TOP of your shirt. Yes, you've technically covered your boobs, but you're still drawing so much attention to the shape of your boobs that it's not really modest.\n\n(^ to be fair, this isn't a perfect example because boobs are much more obviously sensual than hair imo. But hopefully you get what I mean.)\n\nFWIW, wigs seem to be way more common among Orthodox Jewish women in Canada and the US.

(Jewish mothers... keeping the local therapist gainfully employed since forever.) I know some adult Jews who don't talk to their parents anymore.\n\nBut it's true that Jewish trauma usually has less to do with academics. I think there are a few reasons why. First, Jews seem less obsessed than Asians with ranking, and with being #1. If a child gets into a good university program, and objectively gets good grades, I think that will be enough for most Jewish parents, even if they \"only\" have the 3rd highest GPA in their school (or whatever).\n\nAlso, Jews are more open to \"literary\" fields (like writing and also law) than some East Asian immigrants. In these fields, it's not always about just memorizing, but there can be more creativity involved. I don't really know if I'm explaining this properly, but basically, Jews don't have the Confucian ethic of \"follow elders and tradition above all else.\" More Jews encourage their children to ask questions, be creative, challenge authority, etc. (I know some religious families are exceptions, but I'm talking about general trends.)

(For example, I have an athletic/rectangle body, and I've learned that for me, fitted or belted dresses are best; loose, flowy dresses with no belt or waist details are no good.)\n\n2) Browse through Instagram or some other fashion book/catalogue that you like, and try to catalogue any outfits that you see and like - regardless of why, and even if you don't know (yet) if that outfit will look good on you.\n\nThis will help you develop an eye for what goes with what (e.g. types of tops with types of skirts), and, in the case of Instagram, it can give you ideas for more modern outfits that aren't granny-ish.\n\n[Some recommended  IG searches: #modestfashion, #longskirts, #maxidress, #winterfashion, #tzniut, #tznius, anything Christian-related.\n\nI'm also in love with Justine Leconte's youtube channel.

So keep them in mind as an option.\n\n4) Be picky!!!\n\nIt can be harder to find modest clothing, but don't let that make you desperate.

It should just look like you're wearing your shirt over a regular skirt.\n* A regular summer dress that at least has straps, and is past your knees. You can pair it with a denim jacket on top (to cover your parts of your chest, shoulders, and elbows).\n* If you wear \"long shorts\" (almost knee-length), avoid denim. Denim pants shouldn't be a \"thing\" in the heat.\n\nI wish I could recommend a specific store or brand, but personally, I just find individual items on Poshmark (or in stores like Winners, pre-Covid 19) and buy them.\n\nI think someone in this sub posted a link to a Pakistani retailer a while back.

Somebody who's happy and fulfilled in life isn't going to look for opportunities to put other people down... it's a sign of pettiness and moral ugliness (on the part of the bully), frankly.\n\nI mean, let's suppose you really were overweight and looked bad in school. So what? If these people were looking out for your health, they'd find a more caring way to help than just making fun of you. They're twats; you just had the cosmic misfortune of being in their way at a bad moment. If somebody else had been there, they'd bully that person instead.\n\nWrt trying to run right now: slow and steady wins the race. You can't run a mile? What about walking-jogging that distance? What about running 0.1 miles? Do whatever you can do right now, do it often, and gradually level up. (The usual rule of thumb is to increase your weekly total distance by 10% or less.)\n\nPersonally, I've found that the only way to change my mentality about what I can / can't do is through action. I always think I can't do something - that running X distance will be too hard - until I do it (and break my previous records). Again: slow and steady wins the race. As long as you keep moving forward, you will eventually meet every goal/milestone.\n\nAnd last but not least: take good care of yourself, and allow yourself to be human. If you need to cry one day, let yourself cry. If running around other people gives you massive anxiety (due to body image issues), and you need to run in a more private location or in the evening, it's also perfectly OK to do that. You can't dwell on the past forever, but at the same time, you're a human being. It's OK to feel hurt. It's OK to give yourself time to process it all.
