[{"author": "mrggy", "body": "I think you're fundamentally misunderstanding how study abroad program work.\n\nGiven that based off your native language you seem to be European and therefore may have grew up in a multilingual society, try and listen to this perspective with an open mind, ok? Basically I think it's really important that people study abroad, even if they don't have linguistic abilities and the reason for this system is based on some American social realities.\n\nAmerica is not a multilingual society. Even if you have an interest in language learning, it's hard to get off the ground level. In many public schools you're often not even *allowed* to start learning a foreign language until you're 14. Even then you run into issues with education quality. Depending on your school your foreign language class may only be offered twice a week. It's hard to actually learn anything in those conditions. Even then, in a lot of schools only two years of this subpar language class is required. Most students choose not to.\n\nIn my school, out of 700 students in my grade, the vast majority of whom took  Spanish as their foreign language, only 20 of us took 4th year Spanish. And honestly, the class sucked. I didn't learn a thing. Despite loving language learning, applying myself, doing all that I felt I could as a 17 year old, I walked out of 4 years of Spanish education unable to have a conversation in Spanish. Out of the 20 people in my class, only 2 non-heritage speakers passed the standardized national exam at the end of the year.\n\nAnd this was my experience going to a wealthy, well funded, high achieving school in the suburbs. The people who even get to a conversation level from a school language program were either extremely lucky, or went to a (private) school that was even wealthy and better funded than mine. Can we really be surprised then if most students graduate with no language proficiency and little interest in further language study? With the poor education they received, it's no wonder they see little value in it.\n\nAnother factor to consider is that America is very large and leaving it is very expensive. Unlike in Europe where an international vacation is feasible even for a poorer family with enough planning and savings, in the U.S. international vacations are a sign of wealth and a major class indicator. People from lower income backgrounds are disproportionately more likely to have attended a school with an underfunded language program and to have never left the country.\n\nMany degree programs in the U.S. don't require foreign language classes. If you're in a more rigorous STEM program, you may even be discouraged from language study for fear that it'll distract from your very intense core classes.\n\nThus we end up with a huge number of monolingual American college students, with very little exposure to other cultures/the rest of the world, who can't afford to vacation abroad. Universities (and this is a good thing, I believe) strongly encourage all students to study abroad. Their thinking is that studying abroad and increases intercultural awareness and empathy, which is vital in our increasingly global world.\n\nSo here's the kicker: *colleges fund study abroad programs.* If you receive financial aide from the university (which many students, especially low income students do), you can apply that financial aide towards studying abroad. Without that aide money, many students wouldn't be able to go abroad at all. For many people, study abroad is the only international experience they've ever had, and will have for the foreseeable future.\n\nIn order to encourage people to study abroad and gain that international experience, colleges offer programs that don't have language programs, because like I said, most students are monolingual and not studying a language. They offer programs where you can take classes for your major abroad, so even people in really intense STEM majors can study abroad. Thus we end up where people study abroad in countries where they can't speak the language.\n\nI agree with you that people should learn the language if they're planning to live abroad long term. Believe me, I'm with you. I hate the wealthy Americans who retire in Mexico and never bother to learn Spanish. But that's not what's happening here. 3 months isn't even long term. You can't even reach the conversational level in 3 months. I do think students should take an elective course in the local language while they're in country, but I don't think prior study or achievement of actual fluency should be expected.\n\nWe have a couple of realities that have to be contended with. Reality 1: Due to how fucked up and unequal the American education system, most people are monolingual. Reality 2: Income inequality in the US is really bad, and many people have little or no exposure to foreign cultures or the international community. Reality 3: Internationalization and having international experience is a good thing, both for the society and the individual.\n\nBasically these programs arise to address some very American social issues. The barrier to bilingualism is extremely high in some parts of America. If we say that you should only study abroad if you speak the language of the host country, we effectively limit study abroad, and by extension international experience, to the wealthy and the heritage speaker children of immigrants (weird combination, but)", "created_utc": "1663634835.0", "edited": "1663635420.0", "id": "ip4xeh5", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_xhryav", "parent_id": "t1_ip4qedc", "score": "0", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "mrggy", "body": "There are loads of non linguistically oriented study abroad programs.

Absolutely not.\n\nAnd as someone who's studied abroad and moved abroad as an adult, the two things aren't comparable, especially if we're talking about a semester long study abroad (most Americans study abroad between 3 week and 3 months). I mean at that point you're not even considered a resident for tax purposes.  Depending on the program study abroad can be structured like an extended vacation, especially the really short ones. Even with the semester long ones you're so tied into the university system and the bubble of the school and you're program.

No one can force you to do that. However it would probably greatly improve your experience if you at least learned some survival Japanese. As others have told you English levels are pretty low in Japan. This is true even among service workers, especially when you get outside of Central Tokyo. \n\nYou said in a comment that you can read hiragana and katakana! That's great! That will help a lot. For survival Japanese, I would recommend learning the kanji for food (\u8089\u3001\u9d8f\u8089\u3001\u5375, etc) and numbers (used *very* occasionally on menus for prices). Learn how to read a menu and order a meal at a restaurant in Japanese. Learn how to buy things at a store in Japanese. Just knowing how to do those simple interactions in Japanese will allow you to move around more independently and leave touristy areas without needing help from a Japanese speaking friend. \n\nIf you find that you want to study Japanese past that then by all means do! But I do understand the hesitation if you don't intend to continue with the language past your few months long study abroad. Realistically, unless you're willing to dedicate serious amounts of time to learning this language as a legitimate hobby, then you won't get to conversational level within the next year.

This is a skill that's directly transferable to corporate sales. Clients all gave different needs, and you have to approach each one differently. Similarly clients may not always realize how our products could help solve their everyday problems, so it take observation skills on the part of the sales rep to notice where the need is, and creativity to find a solution.

While of course there are foreigners who work in Japanese offices and Japanese people who recognize the linguistic ability of foreigners, etc I would say that on a meta societal level, foreigners speaking Japanese is often viewed more as a party trick rather than actual language skills that can be used for communication, if that makes sense. Just about every foreigner in Japan has experienced something akin to this [comedy skit](https://youtu.be/oLt5qSm9U80), for example.\n\nI've heard from multiple professional translators that their Japanese colleagues will express awe at their ability to read and write even basic kanji.

Basically the Japanese government has taken the stance that they don't want immigrants in Japan, but the desperately need foreign labor. As a result the economy is built on a guest laborer system where people, be it factory workers or English teachers, are brought in on short term contracts for max of 5 years. There are ways to get around the max, but the expectation is very much that you'll come to Japan for a few years, then leave and be replaced by a newer, younger worker from your same country. People aren't expected to be here long term, to build a life, family, or career here, so they're not expected to learn the language to a high level. Foreigners in Japan often work in jobs made for foreigners, be it English teaching, foreign companies with English work enviornments, translation, overseas sales, etc. Socially, many people keep foreigners at arm's length or in a separate category. \n\nThat's interesting about heritage speakers in China! I've heard from Japanese-Americans that it can be a double edged sword.

So you'll progress more quickly on reading, but be on pace with everyone else for everything else.\n\nWhile it is true that Chinese speakers can pass the JLPT much faster than non-Chinese speakers, this is mainly because the JLPT is mostly a reading test. You run into huge issue with Chinese speakers who zoom through the JLPT levels and pass the N1, but on the CEFR scale are only assessed at B1 level because their other language skills are so low level. So imo, it's less that it's easier for Chinese speakers to learn Japanese and more that it's easier for Chinese speakers to game the JLPT\n\nSource: https://jfstandard.jp/pdf/jfs_jlpt_diagram2017(english).pdf", "created_utc": "1658054254.0", "edited": "1658055107.0", "id": "igi57l4", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_w12704", "parent_id": "t3_w12704", "score": "14", "subreddit": "LearnJapanese", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qyls"}, {"author": "mrggy", "body": "Yeah it's definitely a lot!

So I think on an individual level, to a certain extent it's ok to decide for yourself whether or not you want to identify as a native speaker of a certain language. I think its ok if we leave the definition a little wishy washy.\n\nI will say though that when people talk about \"native speakers\" they usually mean people who have spoken a language since childhood, in an environment where other people also spoke the language, and were educated in that language. Many people who have multiple native languages weren't educated in all of their languages. This can therefore create difference in the way these people use language. For example, a Chinese-American and a Chinese person born and raised in China. Because the Chinese-American wasn't educated in Chinese, they'll likely struggle to discuss physics in Chinese, for example.\n\nThis is ultimately fine and just an aspect of linguistic diversity that results from different people's different experiences growing up. A Chinese farmer who never went to high school would likely also struggle to discuss even basic physics in Chinese. Similarly, a Chinese person born and raised in China who went to English immersion schools for their entire education would likely also struggle to discuss physics in Chinese.\n\nWhat does kind of rub me the wrong way is when native speakers who weren't educated or were only partially educated in their language don't properly acknowledge the impact of their background on the their relationship with their language, especially when they take on a teaching role. I've just seen so many bilingual Japanese Youtubers who act like they are the absolutely authority on English and everything they say about the English language is automatically correct because they're a native speaker. When in reality, yes they're a native speaker, but they left the US when they were a child and the majority of their education was conducted monolingually in Japanese. Yes their basic English is fine, but they often struggle with complex vocabulary or nuanced questions about American culture (and sociolinguistics). Which is totally fair! Because they were children when they lived in America, and therefore have a child's knowledge of English and American culture. There's nothing wrong with that!

Your CO first has the right to decide if they want you to stay on for another year or not. If they decide that they want you to stay, they then approach you and ask you if you'd like to stay. You give them your answer. Your CO then submits the appropriate paperwork to JET. This means there are 3 possible outcomes of recontacting conversations\n\n1. ALT not offered a contract renewal\n2. ALT offered a contract renewal, but refuses\n3. ALT offered a contract renewal and accepts.\n\nThe COs are allowed to use whatever standards they want when deciding whether or not to offer you a contract renewal. In some places this can take the form of an interview, review of your past performance, surveys from your JTEs etc. This isn't a required step though, so many COs skip it and don't require anything from you for recontracting.\n\nHowever, we are very expensive to replace. If the CO doesn't renew our contract or we choose not to accept our contract renewal, the CO has the foot the bill for not only our return plane ticket, but also the plane ticket for the incoming ALT. Most COs would rather avoid this added cost, so in a lot of places, even if you're not well liked, even if you're not very good at your job, as long as your haven't killed anyone, you're basically guaranteed to be offered a contract renewal.

English syllables work very differently from Japanese mora and most people have a really hard time \"hearing\" syllables. Similarly rhyming isn't a feature of Japanese poetry, so Japanese people an sometimes struggle with writing rhyme based English poetry as well. Japanese also doesn't have stress, so I would assume a Japanese person would really struggle with understanding meter as well. Though tbh I'm a native English speaker and I also really struggle with meter haha.\n\nOn the flip side I've seen English speakers who try to write haikus in Japanese struggle to get an appropriate balance between kanji and kana, or with understanding what topics make appropriate topics for a haiku from a Japanese cultural lens (should capture a specific moment, usually related to nature during a specific season).\n\nYou can write free verse poetry in any language with about the same amount of ease (accounting for language level). My A1-A2 level students even write free verse poetry in English, so you can start writing poetry from a surprisingly low level. It just might not be, well, good. (Though sometimes their poems are surprisingly good! Especially given the fact that they're only 14!)\n\nIf you're looking to learn a new language with the goal of writing poetry, I would suggest first looking into some of that language's poetic traditions.

Shaken is a big inspection that has to be done every two years. It's quite expensive. The exact cost depends on your actual car, but I would budget at least 100,000 to be safe. Usually white plates are more expensive than kei cars and old cars are more expensive than new cars. Car tax is a yearly tax you pay in the spring to your city/town. Cost will depend on they type of car you have and your town. It's usually 7,000 yen for my kei car.\n\nThe big question to ask when buying a car is when the shaken is. If a car just had it's shaken, the price will likely be a bit higher. If the shaken is due soon, the car should either be heavily discounted, or you have quite a bit of room to negotiate.\n\nDoes Ibaraki get snow?

The big thing is that they want people who will come to Japan for a few years, then return to their home country and go on to do exciting things (and hopefully promote bilateral relations with Japan while doing so).\n\nSo if you're extremely well qualified, but the story you tell in your SOP and interview is \"I've tailor made my resume for JET. JET is my life goal. Once I become an ALT in Japan, my life will be complete,\" JET's not gonna be super interested. Whereas someone who doesn't have as much experience but says \"Here's the experience I have. While it might be non-traditional, I think it'll help in Japan via X.

So by necessity, Google Translate or English will end up getting used, or your partner will end up being the translator a lot. It can take quite a while to get over that initial hump, especially if you don't have a class to act as a safe sandbox to practice the artificial sentences and basic grammar you're learning (unless they're actively tutoring you real people are surprisingly unhelpful for this kind of practice). I strongly recommend joining some sort of class.\n\nFor context, language schools (so if you enroll in an intensive program with multiple hours of class a day) advertise 0-N4 or 0-N3 in a year, depending on the program. JLPT doesn't measure speaking, but assuming speaking abilities are keeping pace with others, I'd say N4 is \"can comfortably handle basic small talk.\" And N3 is \"can handle everyday comversation.\"\n\nI came to Japan for work (so had to use a good amount of English during the day).

For reference, keigo is currently covered at the N4 level.\n\nMy reasoning for this is that irl, if you can barely string sentence together, absolutely no Japanese person will expect you to be using keigo. If it's truely a situation so formal that keigo is required, there will either be someone translating or Google Translate will be doing the heavy lifting, or (as is often the case with customer service situations) the speaker will just drop the keigo so that you can understand. Basically you're expected to achieve fluency in normal speech before you're expected to be whipping out the business keigo.\n\nI think the reason it gets introduced so early is that the earliest textbooks (Genki and MNN) along with the JLPT were designed in the 90s.

The JLPT is a pretty terrible test of holistic language skills and instead tests pretty narrowly for one subset of skills. If you want to pass the JLPT then you have to make sure you're practicing the kind of academic reading it tests for. \n\nThe JLPT listening section is just dumb. The Japanese in it isn't terribly difficult, especially when compared to tests for other languages of similar level. The difficult thing is just the formatting. I'm pretty sure I'd even find a JLPT style English listening exam to be taxing. I find the listening section to be an extremely difficult test filled with relatively simple Japanese.

Those are skills often neglected by Japanese learners, but they're super valuable. They're also the ones that I personally find to be the most rewarding.

There's no right or wrong answers.\n\nEdit: because thinking about it makes me annoyed, let me illustrate how dumb the JLPT listening is by comparing it with something you'd here the DELE (Spanish) B2 listen exam. Like you said, the JLPT is all just people being indecisive. 90% of the questions are just \"what will the man do next?\" But, even if you don't understand what D is, as long as you understand that D is their final decision, then you can answer the question, because all the answer choices are direct quotes from the recording. Whereas in the DELE it'd be something like\n\nA: Hey Marta! How've you been? Haven't seen you around lately.\n\nB: Good to see you too, Jos\u00e9. I've actually had a bit of a rough time recently. I was hospitalized last week.\n\nA: Oh no! That's terrible! What happened? Are you ok?\n\nB: I sprained my ankle on the job, but it's nothing major I'm fine now.

In order to answer the question, you have to know that \"hospitalized\" and \"in the hospital\" are synonyms and be able to realized that \"straining your ankle on the job\" is an example of an a \"workplace injury.\" The JLPT doesn't require you to synthesize information like that (which is actually a higher level language skill) and instead relies on trick questions and convoluted misdirection", "created_utc": "1656860868.0", "edited": "1656862312.0", "id": "iepd347", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_vqhs43", "parent_id": "t3_vqhs43", "score": "29", "subreddit": "LearnJapanese", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qyls"}, {"author": "mrggy", "body": "Going purely off vibes\n\nStudy: Intensive reading, textbook work, WaniKani, composition practice\n\nPlay: Tiktok, talking with friends, Youtube \n\nFor extensive reading, watching TV, and podcasts it depends on my mood.

And honestly the listening section is really easy, so it's mostly just a reading test. If you purely focus on reading and listening, just cramming grammar and vocab, you can reach exam passing level pretty quickly.\n\nHere's the thing though. That approach requires you to completely ignore speaking and writing, really output of any kind. If you want to live in Japan, output is very important. That's how you communicate with people. The thing is though, you build output skills through practice. It takes time. If you actually put the time and energy into practicing output, you can't speed run the JLPT.\n\nSo technically, yes. You could pass the N3 in a year. But it would require you to completely ignore speaking, meaning that once you actually get here, you wouldn't be able to communicate with anyone.

There's almost this assumption in Japan/Japanese learning communities that a non-native speaker will never be able to work an office job as efficiently as a native speaker, or that there are limits on the type of work you can do as a non-native speaker. This always frustrates me because if you look at the US, Canada, or the UK, there are non-native English speakers working all sorts of jobs! I think it's just the different standards we hold for ESL folks vs native English speakers learning a foreign language. \n\nThinking about the metric you used as an example, casual group conversations, it makes me think about the ways we measure language learning. Someone posted the main takeaways from a US foreign service report about language learning based on the decades of experience from teaching diplomats. One of the takeaways was that nearly everyone agreed that a dinner party was more taxing linguistically than a speech or a press conference. If you look at CEFR or ILR standards, casual conversation is almost always ranked as a lower level skill than giving a formal speech or presentation. To me this suggests a problem with how we classify language skills. We give too much priority to academic and business language (perhaps because of the associated prestige). On a personal level, as someone who doesn't use my TL for work/school, I've found it very difficult to try and self assess my level because once you hit B2 most of the Can-Do statements revolve around academic/business language.\n\nI'm also reminded of an experience recently where I saw this play out in real time. I live in Japan and me and my native English speaker friends went to 2 separate dinners with 2 separate Japanese friends. In both cases it was our first time hanging out. The first friend, Y, had very little formal English education and had slacked off during lessons in school. Her reading and writing skills are quite poor. However she spent a couple of months living in the US/Canada in her 20s and has spent the last 10 years working as a liason for native English speakers and casually chatting in English. We had to simplify our English quite a lot, but she was able to follow our banter and contribute to the conversation fluidly. \n\nThen we went to dinner the next week with S. She was an English major in college and is now a professional English teacher in a public high school. On paper, her English in miles above Y's. However, despite simplifying our language quite a lot, it was clear S had no idea what was going on 90% of the time and she only spoke when spoken to (though she seemed to still be enjoying herself). \n\nI think this shows that TL conversation skills are to a certain extent somewhat separate from overall general skills. S could beat Y hands down in a vocab test, but it was Y, not S, who was able to keep up with the conversation. Of course vocab etc are helpful for increasing conversational ability, but they're not enough. Conversation is a skill unto itself and has to be practiced as such. \n\n\"Practice conversation to get better at conversation\" is hardly a revolutionary insight, but I think it scratches the surface of a much more nuanced conversation about how we classify the difficultly of language tasks and the way that we expect language skills to progress", "created_utc": "1656226978.0", "edited": "1656227426.0", "id": "ids3vpq", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_vksv60", "parent_id": "t3_vksv60", "score": "11", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "mrggy", "body": "Most folks I know who moved here with \"some Japanese,\" but don't really actively study plateau around the N3 level.

The salary question is a nuanced one. Some background: Jobs in Japan pay poorly across the board. Japanese people are generally overworked and underpaid. The Japanese economy has actually had a problem with stagnant wages for the last couple of decades. So, if you just look at a Japan centric POV, we make more than most people fresh out of college in Japan. However, they have much more potential for salary growth than we do. They also get pretty substantial bonuses (which we do not get), so while our monthly pay is considered super high, it's debatable how much high our real annual take-home actually is. JET is one of the highest paying ALT gigs. Though ALT jobs as a whole don't pay very well. Looking from a more global POV though, the JET salary is really low. A first year JET salary is minimum wage in some parts of the US\n2. It's hard to make a career out of being an ALT. Basically there's a perception in Japan that ALTs are temporary guest workers, so it's not uncommon for contracts to come with time limits (like JET) or to not allow for any salary growth. If you want to a make a career out of teaching English in Japan, you'll need to move from ALTing to either University teaching (requires a masters and teaching experience), international schools (requires a teaching license from your home country), or to become a licensed teacher in Japan, which would allow you to work as a regular public school teacher (not sure about this process, but know a couple people who've done it).\n3. As long as you can secure another job you can stay. JET generally doesn't like being a spring board for people's life in Japan though. They prefer people who will return to their home country and promote Japan-home-country relations. So that could trip you up a bit at the application stage\n4. JET will take anything, it doesn't matter. If you're interested in making a career out of teaching English in Japan though, I recommend studying teaching, ESL, etc.\n5. I think I remember reading that median salary nation wide was 4-5 million yen. Obviously the definition of a \"good\" salary depends on location, family size, lifestyle etc. I see very few jobs posted for English speakers (even bilingual ones) for more than 3.5 million\n6. You seem to be coming at this through the lens of \"I like Japanese\" (which is fine. Explore your options.) But I think a more important thing to consider is do you like teaching?

I recommend getting snow boots that go up to at least mid-calf, have good traction, and are easy to take on and off. With how much you change shoes in Japan, lace up boots quickly become a hassle, so I recommend something zippered. Snowpants are useful for shoveling snow, but not a necessary for daily use.\n\nRoads don't get cleared completely here. They actually leave a layer of snow and road, so you can't see the blacktop at all. In the fall you'll need to change your cars tires and windshield wipers to snow tires/wipers. Any Mechanic can do this. Your car should come with snow tires when you buy it.\n\nThe key to driving in snow is just to drive slow. It's a good practice to start breaking earlier than normal and pump your breaks. Be cautious of black ice when making sharp turns. If you loose traction the key is to not panic and go with the spin until you regain traction. If you get caught in a white out (0 visablity due to heavy snow), put on your headlights and your hazard lights and drive slow, but don't stop. If you stop, someone could accidentally run into from behind.\n\nSchools do close sometimes for snow. Usually if it's blizzarding and visibility is too low for the kids to safely get to school.

Coming on JET with a family is totally doable. I know multiple people who've done it. Money might be a little tight though, so come with some savings if possible.\n   1. a. I'm not aware of anyone getting subsidies for family transport, but I'm far from the expert \n   2. b. There's no national guidelines for how to handle Japanese Second Language (JSL) kids. As such it totally depends on the local school. If you're placed somewhere with a large foreign population there might be a program already in place. Most likely though, you're child will be the only JSL student at their school and you'll work with the school to design a personalized plan. Most likely (since they're so young) they'll put them in regular classes with an assigned assistant teacher (who may or may not speak English) to give them one on one support. At that age, your child should pick up the language pretty quickly though. From there the next hurdle will be making sure they maintain their English.\n      1. i. Japan's special ed programs (unlike their JSL programs) do exist, but aren't as developed as in the US. I believe Japan only developed national guidelines for special education in about 2009 iirc. Special ed in Japan is divided into 3 main categories \u60c5\u7dd2 (mood), \u77e5\u7684 (intellectual), and \u8a00\u8a9e (linguistic). At least at my elementary schools, the three categories are treated more or less the same: students are a assigned a helper teacher who sits next to them in class. These are either regular teachers, or part time para-professionals. There are no IEPs or anything like that. From what I can tell, special ed kids are just exempt from most educational standards. The teachers usually have no additional special ed training or certification. Students may join the main class, or may receive one on one teaching in another room, depending on their ability level. And that's about it. It's possible the school could contract a specialist for your child, but I doubt it given the language barrier\n2. Japan doesn't recognize same-sex marriage, so your wife would be ineligible for a dependent visa. Talk to your local embassy. I've heard of same sex spouses being issues \"designated activities\" visas as a work around, but I'm not sure about how that works\n3. I'm not trans, but from what I've heard, as long as your paperwork is in order, you should be fine. When filling out your application, list your need for hormones in the medical section and you should (hopefully) be placed in an area with access to a clinic. I would recommend doing some research into availability of hormone clinics in Japan so you can clearly lay out what your needs are in your application (ie will any city with an endocrinologist do? Do you need to be Tokyo/Osaka?) If you speak Japanese, here's a [video](https://youtu.be/0yIkhEDrx0U) from a Japanese trans man about going to his hormone appointment. I recommend reaching out to Stonewall Japan for more information. \n4. I would actually say it's the reverse. I think it's more common for BOEs to provide apartments/subsidies. It's just that not all do. You'll often be placed in teachers housing. Tokyo is the only place I'm aware of where you are entirely in charge of finding your own place to live. In my area someone just came with a family. The apartment her pred lived in was too small for a family, so the BOE changed her base school so that she could live in more spacious teacher housing. \n5. This will be a bit more tricky since your wife won't be on a dependent visa. Check with the embassy about work allowances for designated activities visas. Assuming her visa allows her to work, then it'll be a bit difficult for her to find something without a degree. She'll likely be limited to manual labor or convenience store work. A college degree is one of the requirements of a work visa, so she won't be able to switch to getting a work visa in her own right. It sounds like she's working on a degree currently though? If she can get her degree lots of doors will open for her in the eikaiwa (private English schools) world", "created_utc": "1655689726.0", "edited": "1655693471.0", "id": "id0fnav", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_vg9ixy", "parent_id": "t3_vg9ixy", "score": "11", "subreddit": "JETProgramme", "subreddit_id": "t5_2w9xe"}, {"author": "mrggy", "body": "One of my friends came on JET at 28 and is now 32.

To the point where it's actually become of bit of a topic of discussion/social issue as immigrants who move to Japan for work really struggle to find opportunities to learn Japanese. The main option is language schools, but those are very expensive and usually don't allow you to work full time.\n\nIf you have a job in Japan, you're only real option (outside of private tutoring) is community run Japanese classes. However these classes are often run by retirees who don't want to teach nights or weekends, so all classes are weekday mornings, making the classes inaccessible to 9-5 workers. This was fine 20 years ago when there weren't many foreign workers in Japan and most students were foreign homemakers with Japanese husbands, but nowadays it's grossly inadequate. If you're outside of a major metropolitan area, there are often no classes at all available. On top of that, when classes are available, they're often capped at the N4 level. You can't study past the beginner level.\n\nAs a result, learning Japanese in Japan tends to be very much sink or swim. You're entirely on your own and have to self study your way to fluency. If you're in Japan with poor Japanese in the first place, you likely work at a job where you speak English.

Sometimes the vocab words its teaching you are actually very useful words. Other times, they're, well, not.

They readily admit that while they try to select useful vocab words, they'll grab uncommon ones if they can't find more common words for a certain kanji.

A LOT of the kids at my center take the English course, and I've looked at some of the sample worksheets online and a coworker whose son does English Kumon showed me some of his homework. I'm an English teacher.\n\nI can't speak for Kumon's English program in other countries, but at least in Japan, I don't think it's great. Though I think the very early levels are actually pretty good. There's a big colorful booklet and the kids have a ORC pen (or something) that will say the name of the object in the picture when they touch it, and then the kid repeats after the recording. A lot of the little kids actually have shockingly good pronunciation. The problems come when you get to the higher levels.\n\nOnce you graduate from the picture books it suddenly turns very heavy into grammar and translation. Students are given a sentence and are able to hear them read aloud using the pen. They're also given a translation of the sentence into Japanese. My understanding is that the kids are supposed to just repeat after then pen repeatedly when looking at the sentence and by doing that are supposed to learn how to map sounds on to words and learn to read. The problem is that (from what I can tell) Kumon never teaches phonics, so the kids are never able actually able to make the jump from repeating after the pen to reading. They just end up memorizing the sentences. If they can't memorize the sentences, my Kumon instructor ends up writing the pronunciation in katakana for them and they memorize that. If you're not familiar with katakana, it turns \"I want an apple\" into \"Ai wanto an appuru\" so it basically destroys all of the gains they made in pronunciation in the early years. On top of reading, there seem to sentence scramble and other drills. The only speaking component is repeating after the pen and reading the sentences aloud\n\nAt the upper levels they're given longer paragraphs to read, but even then, the Japanese translation is always provided right there on the same page as the English. That disincentivizes the kids to try and figure out the English for themselves and leads them to just give up and check the Japanese the second things get challenging. The comprehension questions don't require any higher level thinking skills (but that's more a factor of the education system generally) and just require kids to pull quotes from the reading, so they're effectively able to answer the questions without having really read or understood the English reading.\n\nAlso, my Kumon teacher doesn't speak English, so the kids are unable to ask her questions if they're confused.\n\nOn the off chance that someone's interested in learning Japanese, I do actually recommend the \u56fd\u8a9e course.

The kids attend the local Elementary school and are considered members of the class, but they do online school following the Filipino curriculum in a separate room during core subjects. They join the rest of their class for art, music, PE, etc. I believe the kids are trying to learn Japanese.\n\nSomething to keep in mind is that while international schools do exist, they're only in urban areas (JET is famous for sending people to generally rural areas), and you absolutely cannot afford the tuition on a JET salary. Annual tuition at a lot of those schools is near the price of a JETs annual salary.\n\nThere's no real regulations for how to handle JSL kids, so it's really just left up to each individual school/BOE.

When we were studying abroad a friend used ud. with someone her own age that she'd just met for the first time (something normal in the dialect of Spanish she was used to) and he low key got offended. He played it off as joke since she's a learner, but his feeling about being addressed with ud. were clear.

I heard from my Spanish friends that there's been a shift in recent years towards t\u00fa becoming even more widely used. Children tutear their teachers even. My Honduran friend was shocked, as she doesn't even tutear her own mother. If you're learning Spanish in Spain, there arguably isn't much need to spend a lot of time on Ud. at the beginning levels. The super formal job interview, court of law type situations where you really do need Ud. are not relevant to you at this level.\n\nCompare this to Japanese. Japanese cares a lot about formality can has like 87 levels of it. What level of formality you use when can vary quite a lot based off the local culture and your personality/social standing, but using the basic desu/masu formal when meeting new people can be assumed to be a given.

I think that's kind of the idea y'all were bumping into when Ayami brought up the idea that honne can lead to bullying. With honne/tatemae, you're always expressing a reaction, always commenting, it's just the nature of the comment that changes. Whereas I feel from an American pov, we would often choose to just not comment on something we find distasteful.\n\nSimilarly, we have phrases like \"that's a choice.\" The meaning here is that the speaker thinks the choice in question was a bad one, but they don't want to directly say that because it would be rude, but they also don't want to lie because that would also be rude. So, they just state a fact, saying that a choice was made, and avoide directly commenting on whether the choice was good or bad. You could even say it's to the point that stating very obvious facts in American culture is a way to express negetive feelings indirectly. In your baseball game example, if your friend asked you how the game was, you could say \"yeah, I mean, it was a game. Hope they do better next time!\" You avoid giving an opinion by stating a needlessly obvious fact (even though if the other person is also familiar with this aspect of American culture, they can easily interpret this statement of fact as an expression of disapproval) and then pivoting to a more positive aspect of the experience.

From what I can tell, langauge schools seem to be more test oriented while university programs tend to be more holistic. \n\nLanguage schools are always preparing you for something, be it the JLPT or a university entrance exam. The end goal is you passing that test. As such they tend to be more reading focused (since the JLPT is mostly a reading focused test). There are also language schools that cater more towards short term students that are less test focused and more 'cultural experience' focused.\n\nUniversity courses tend to approach the Japanese language a little more holistically. You'll often get more of a focus on speaking and writing from university classes (though with enough research you can find langauge schools that prioritize output). You can also sometimes find special topics courses at universities, such as Contemporary Social Issues or Economics, which aim to teach you content and specialized terminology as well as basic language skills. I've never seen a language school offer courses like that. \n\nI've also noticed that language schools tend to max out at the N1 course/university entrance exam course. Once you hit N1, they don't have much to offer you (even though there's so much room to grow past N1). On the flip side I've seen university academic writing courses where N1 is the prerequisite.\n\nLanguage schools also tend to be structured more around allowing you to work. Regardless of whether your go to university or language school you'll be on a student visa and legally allowed to work part time. Language schools just tend to sell that aspect harder and explicitly arrange your schedule so that all your classes are in one chunk, making it easier for you to work part time (usually your classes will either be every morning or every afternoon). University schedules are more all over the place. While you can certainly get a part time job while studying at a university, your schedule isn't optimized for work\n\nAs for why language schools are more popular, that's an interesting question that I've never thought about. I would say it's probably due to advertising. Language schools aggressively advertise their programs while universities tend to be pretty quiet about theirs. If you decide you want to go study Japanese in Japan, language school ads will be the first thing you see, and the thing you see people talking about the most, so you don't even stop to consider if university programs are even an option", "created_utc": "1652439698.0", "edited": "1652440221.0", "id": "i8fqdz6", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_uoo352", "parent_id": "t3_uoo352", "score": "19", "subreddit": "LearnJapanese", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qyls"}, {"author": "mrggy", "body": "Oh have they moved to an app?

Look into careers in the foreign service or other international organizations.\n\nI also am a big planner and knew from the time I was about 15 that I was interested in JET. Here's the best thing I did to prepare: In college I volunteered teaching English to the local immigrant community. If you're thinking about signing a work contract to teach English for at least a year, you should probably make sure you actually like teaching English first. Through that experience I realized that I do really like teaching, got some valuable teaching experience, and was able to give back to my community.

As such, we usually don't use it for things that are assumed to be fun unless we're being really over exuberant. Thus why \"I enjoyed eating ice cream,\" feels odd. Of course you enjoyed it? It feels like you're unnecessarily stating the obvious. As a result it can even carry the connotation that \"normally I don't really like ice cream (because it gives me a brain freeze), but it was so hot yesterday that I actually enjoyed eating ice cream.\" It's much more natural to just say \"I ate ice cream.\" The fact that you enjoyed it is implied and doesn't need to be explicitly stated\n\nSomeone pointed out that it's better to teach the kids slightly unnatural usable English, rather than obsessing over naturalness.

We did \n\nDon Janken: put pictures cards in a line on the floor. Split the kids into two teams and put them at opposite sides of line of cards. A representative from each side moves down the line, saying the vocab word for each card as they go. When they two kids meet in the middle, they play Janken. The loser goes back to their team while the winner continues on. The losing team sends out a new rep, from the beginning of the line. The first team to have a rep reach the other side wins.\n\nShooting Game: Vocab time trials. One kid stands at the front. The other kids are randomly given vocab cards.

We don't have this distinction in the US so it can be a little confusing for Americans to understand. I don't know how it is in other counties though.\n\n\u6b63\u793e\u54e1 translates to \"regular employee\" or \"full time employee\" but it's in contrast with contract and part-time workers. Traditionally, you enter a company after graduating college and stay there until you retire. You're afforded very strong labor protections and are close to impossible to fire. As a result, you are also very expensive to employ. So, since the Japanese economy crashed in the 90s, there's been an increased reliance on short term (or sometimes not so short term) contract workers and part time workers. These folks are usually paid less, have limited benefits, limited chances for advancement, and are much easier to fire. As theses \"non-regular\" workers have become an increasingly large part of the workforce, reforms have in made to decrease the disparity in treatment between them and the \u6b63\u793e\u54e1, but there's still a rather large gap. \n\nSo, the term \u6b63\u793e\u54e1 refers more to the type of work contract you have, and the legal rights and protections you have in the company as a result, rather than your rank within the company", "created_utc": "1650285564.0", "edited": "1650286090.0", "id": "i579n7n", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_u5zq2w", "parent_id": "t1_i577qjs", "score": "1", "subreddit": "LearnJapanese", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qyls"}, {"author": "mrggy", "body": "To take this advice to the extreme, I have a friend who's been living in Japan for 25 years.

Lincoln is most famous for the Emancipation Proclamation, which freed enslaved people and the whole speech has lots of references to the Civil War, comparing Southern leaders to leaders of the Confederacy.\n\nI didn't even catch the nullification reference at first. I was confused as to why both your translation and the embassy's translation referenced \u5dde\u6a29\u512a\u4f4d, state's rights, when that phrase wasn't used in the original. States rights is a reference to the civil war and a dog whistle for racism that persists to this day, but I didn't understand the connection to the speech. Then I realized that \"nullification\" is a reference to the Nullification Crisis of the 1830s, which was a major conflict in the lead up the Civil War in the 1860s.

The Preamble is by far the most (rhetorically) important part of the Declaration of Independence. A lot of schools even require kids to memorize the Preamble. My school didn't require us to memorize it, but I still know most it. Just about everyone can recognize a quote from it.\n\nIt can be argued that America has a bit of a cult of personality surround the constitution. When a new President is sworn in, they don't vow to protect the country, they vow to protect the *constitution.* We often view the constitution to be not just the the legal document that outlines our system of government, but the physical representation of the soul of the nation. It represents who we are and what it means to be an American. (or at least that's how it's commonly viewed. My own opinions are more nuanced). So by directly quoting the constitution, MLK is able to make a big emotional impact on the audience because 1. everyone knows the quote and 2. he's able to tap into notions of deep rooted patriotism.

The English language (or at least US) film industry tends to expect a higher degree of realism in dialog than the Japanese film/anime industry.

I do think though that at the very least everyone should learn to write the most basic 100 or so kanji.

Note that this changes some of our particles\n\nThe cake was eaten by my sister -> \u304a\u59c9\u3055\u3093\u306b\u30b1\u30fc\u30ad\u3092\u98df\u3079\u3089\u308c\u305f\n\nThese sentences function essentially the same in English as in Japanese. In indicative sentences (ie non-passive, normal sentences) \n the doer of the action is the subject, ie the focus of the sentence. Passive sentences make the object receiving the action the subject. They often don't even mention who's doing the action! In English we tend to not like passive sentences and view them as bad writing. Your high school English teacher may have even told you not to use them at all. Japanese has no such qualms.\n\nIn Japanese, unlike English, the passive is often used to indicate victimization.\n\n\u304a\u59c9\u3055\u3093\u306f\u79c1\u306e\u30b1\u30fc\u30ad\u3092\u98df\u3079\u305f (My sister ate my cake) is a statement of fact.\n\n\u79c1\u306f\u304a\u59c9\u3055\u3093\u306b\u30b1\u30fc\u30ad\u3092\u98df\u3079\u3089\u308c\u305f (I had my cake eaten by my sister/My cake was eaten by my sister) is a crime, someone call the police. \n\nYou asked about \u306b\u3088\u3063\u3066. That's usually used when we want to talk about someone creating or discovering something. It doesn't have the connotation of victimhood. It just says \"we care more about the thing created than the person, so we're making the creation the subject, not the creator.\"\n\nBotchan was written by Natsume Souseki -> \u574a\u3063\u3061\u3083\u3093\u306f\u590f\u76ee\u6f31\u77f3\u306b\u3088\u3063\u3066\u66f8\u304b\u308c\u305f\u3002\n\nThe telephone was invented by Alexander Graham Bell -> \u96fb\u8a71\u306f\u30d9\u30eb\u306b\u3088\u3063\u3066\u767a\u660e\u3055\u308c\u305f\u3002\n\nNow let's look at causative sentences. In English we don't have a causative tense, so translations are a little annoying. Basically causative sentences can mean \"to make/let someone do something.\" I know what you're thinking. \"What do you mean make/let? Those are drastically different things!\" We'll get there don't worry. I think it's most helpful to think of \"make\" as the base meaning. So,\n\nThe mom makes the child eat vegetables -> \u304a\u6bcd\u3055\u3093\u304c\u5b50\u3069\u3082\u306b\u91ce\u83dc\u3092\u98df\u3079\u3055\u305b\u308b\u3002\n\nThe teacher makes the students study -> \u5148\u751f\u304c\u751f\u5f92\u306b\u52c9\u5f37\u3055\u305b\u308b\u3002\n\nSomething to keep in mind here is that who can make you do things? People above you. And what does Japanese care a lot about? Hierarchies. So you can only use the causative when talking about things you make people of equal status or below you do. You can't use the causative to talk about making your boss do something.\n\nNo one likes being made to do things, so the causative inherently has kind of a negetive connotation. But what if the kid likes it? What if it's not suffering? Then we use our old friends \u3066\u304f\u308c\u308b, \u3066\u3082\u3089\u3046, and \u3066\u3042\u3052\u308b\n\nThe mom let's the child eat cake -> \u304a\u6bcd\u3055\u3093\u306f\u5b50\u3069\u3082\u306b\u30b1\u30fc\u30ad\u3092\u98df\u3079\u3055\u305b\u3066\u3042\u3052\u308b\n\nThe teacher let the students watch a movie -> \u5148\u751f\u306f\u751f\u5f92\u306b\u6620\u753b\u3092\u898b\u3055\u305b\u3066\u3042\u3052\u308b\n\nCool so we get passive and we get causative, but what happens when we put the together? Well causative is used for things I'm made to do and passive is used to highlight my own victimhood, so wait! Put them together and we have the ultimate expression of the suffering of childhood.\n\nI was forced/made by my mother to eat vegetables -> \u79c1\u306f\u304a\u6bcd\u3055\u3093\u306b\u91ce\u83dc\u3092\u98df\u3079\u3055\u305b\u3089\u308c\u305f\n\nI was forced/made to study by my teacher -> \u79c1\u306f\u5148\u751f\u306b\u52c9\u5f37\u3055\u305b\u3089\u308c\u305f\n\nBut wait same deal as before. What if I'm actually happy about some of these things I was made to do? What if they weren't suffering? Hello again \u3066\u304f\u308c\u308b, \u3066\u3082\u3089\u3046, and \u3066\u3042\u3052\u308b.\n\nI was allowed by my mom to eat cake -> \u79c1\u306f\u304a\u6bcd\u3055\u3093\u306b\u30b1\u30fc\u30ad\u3092\u98df\u3079\u3055\u305b\u3089\u308c\u3066\u304f\u308c\u305f\u3002\n\nI was allowed by my teacher to watch a movie -> \u79c1\u306f\u5148\u751f\u306b\u6620\u753b\u3092\u898b\u3055\u305b\u3089\u308c\u3066\u304f\u308c\u305f\u3002\n\nThis can also apply for things that you thought were suffering at the time but are now grateful that you were made to do.\n\nWhen I was a kid, I was made by my mom to eat vegetables (and now I'm healthy) -> \u5b50\u3069\u3082\u306e\u3068\u304d\u79c1\u306f\u304a\u6bcd\u3055\u3093\u306b\u91ce\u83dc\u3092\u98df\u3079\u3055\u305b\u3089\u308c\u3066\u304f\u308c\u305f\n\nWhen I was a kid I was made by my mom to go to piano classes (and now I play piano and that's cool) -> \u5b50\u3069\u3082\u306e\u3068\u304d\u79c1\u306f\u304a\u6bcd\u3055\u3093\u306b\u30d4\u30a2\u30ce\u6559\u5ba4\u306b\u884c\u304b\u3055\u308c\u3066\u304f\u308c\u305f\n\nBasically we can some up passive as \"Things someone else did that caused me suffering\" and causative passive as \"things I was made to do that caused me suffering.\"\n\nHope that clears it up!

This is probably why the idea of reading a book or watching TV in Japanese for fun feels like work rather than fun, even though you're at a level to comfortably work in Japanese.\n\nThe way to move past linguistic exhaustion is by increasing your linguistic stamina. Basically you want to get to the point where doing something in Japanese doesn't take any more mental strain than doing it in English. The point where an activity doesn't have to be in English for it to be fun and relaxing. Given that you live in Japan and work in a Japanese office, your listening stamina is likely pretty high (and higher than your reading stamina). So I think you'd be better off trying to build up your listening stamina since it'll take less effort to get it the point where you no longer feel exhausted.\n\nCooking videos or sports videos are great places to start. I think the key is to find some genre of video that's interesting, but easy to understand. Then, gradually increase the amount that you watch. Push yourself, but don't exhaust yourself. Once you get comfortable and no longer feel so much linguistic exhaustion, you'll find yourself having more motivation to challenge more difficult, but potentially more interesting, topics like mystery, scifi, etc and picking up vocab from there.\n\nEdit:\n\n>I simply like \"stories\" in general. If you have recommendations of books easily readable in that category, I am interested\n\nAs far as this goes, the most accessible reading material will generally be things you've read before. That way you can focus on the words rather than the plot. Things aimed at a younger audience are also generally easier to read since they don't try to use a super literary vocabulary. I grew up with the Percy Jackson series, so I've been enjoying reading that in Japanese. Reading novels in Japanese still feels like \"work\" to me though, so it's not something I do too too often (I read a book about once every two months). I tend to prefer to bump into my new vocabulary via video.\n\nActually you might like the drama \u771f\u72af\u4eba\u30d5\u30e9\u30c3\u30b0. All my coworkers are obsessed with it. It's a crime mystery drama, but it's not super police-centric so it avoids a lot of legal/forensic vocabulary and is very watchable. It's available on Japanese Hulu", "created_utc": "1648433308.0", "edited": "1648442995.0", "id": "i2dzmsu", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_tpk6uh", "parent_id": "t1_i2dnwlu", "score": "0", "subreddit": "LearnJapanese", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qyls"}, {"author": "mrggy", "body": "Start with stuff that's wayyyy below your level.

Do you have any (linguistically simple) hobbies? Like cooking, hiking, or sports? If you like videogames the Let's Plays could even work. Watching YouTube videos about that topic could be an easy way to ease your brain into consuming Japanese content for fun\n\nOnce you do that you have to start putting yourself in situations where you'll encounter new words. When you live in Japan it can be really easy to fall into a rut where you always talk about the same topics and end up using the same vocabulary. To exposure yourself to lots of new vocab, you have to purposefully seek it out. I recommend going by theme. Don't know many political words? Watch videos about people discussing politics (or make friends with people who like talking about politics, but it's generally easier to find YouTube videos than friends) and bump into new vocab there.\n\nAlso when you say that you can't understand dramas/anime, what do you mean by that? Not understanding police proceedurals or legal dramas, fine that's normal. Not understanding slice of life stuff though would really surprise me though.

For jobs that require a native Japanese person to speak English (including teaching and translating), I've found the people in these roles to be anywhere from A2-C1 level. For positions entirely in Japanese where you're competing against native speakers, Japanese companies will often expect truly native level abilities. Some companies are more progressive, but a lot take the position of \"why hire a foreigner to this job when I could hire a Japanese person and not have to deal with cultural and linguistic differences.\"\n\nFor the job you're interested in, I feel like it's less of an issue of CEFR level, and more an issue of having business Chinese down pat.

Are they white?\n\nAccording to Emily Skidmore in [this article](https://www.proquest.com/docview/905225486), white, feminine, conventionally attractive people were actually accepted by mainstream society. Nowadays we'd call them \"trans women\" but at the time they were referred to as \"transsexuals.\" This is the term that they would have self identified as, and the standard in the field of gender studies is to refer to people using the terms that they use to identify themselves, so I'll use this term, even though it sounds outdated to the modern ear.\n\nAfter WWII we see a rise in \"respectability politics.\" Basically things which uphold the social order are good, and things which are outside of the realm of \"normal\" are bad. Increased importance was put on the ideas of the nuclear family and traditional gender roles, as these were seen as aspects of American culture strongly opposed the communism of the USSR. Transsexuals of the time aimed to play into this narrative by adhering strictly to traditional gender roles. A transsexual woman of the time was accepted only if she expressed the whitest, most feminine version of womanhood possible.\n\nMost of these developments were happening in the 1950s and 1960s, well before this 1985 TV show. The gay liberation movement kicks off in the 1970s, but it largely ignores transsexual people, leading to the creation of groups like Street Transvestite Action Revolutionaries by Silvia Rivera. (At the time there was a clear division drawn between transsexuals who had had surgical procedures done, and transvestites who hadn't). We then see the emergence in the 1990s of the term \"transgender\" as a unifying term.\n\nSo without having seen the show, based purely on the historical context, my thinking would be that more conservative leaning viewers wouldn't have had their finger on the pulse of the gay liberation movement or anything like that and would have most likely held on to older attitudes from the 1950s and 1960s concerning transsexuals. Namely that as long as they played into respectability politics and traditional gender norms, they could be accepted. So if this character played into traditional notions of white femininity, then I could see why it didn't necessarily become a hot button topic that we remember today.

I have anxiety and have had an overall really good JET experience. Working abroad is by no means an experience limited to the neurotypical. Here are some things to keep in mind/factors that helped me:\n\n1. Not everyone with anxiety is the same. So just because I can cope with my anxiety here doesn't mean that someone else can. I happen to have pretty high functioning anxiety, so I can be an absolute mess inside, silently crying in the bathroom, but still get my work done to a high standard, meet deadlines, and be bubbly for the kids.\n2. Coming here definitely made my anxiety worse. I would strongly recommend having a tele-health therapist set up and ready to go before even coming here. I wasn't seeing a therapist for my first year here, but things probably would have been a lot smoother if I had been. I'd recommend coming only if you've got your anxiety pretty well managed in your home country. Moving abroad is not going to improve your mental health, so if it's not well managed at home, it will likely be just as if not more out of control abroad.\n3. Some situations are more anxiety inducing than others. JET can very much be luck of the draw sometimes. You could end up in a placement you mesh super well with or you could have a placement that ends up causing you a lot of anxiety. There's no way to know beforehand.\n4. I'd lived abroad before. So while I had a lot of Japan/job specific adjustment stress, I knew what to expect with general \"living abroad\" stress and knew already that it wasn't that bad for me and was something that I could handle\n5. I'd dealt with a language barrier before. When I lived abroad previously it was also in a non-English speaking country, so I knew what to expect there. Even though I couldn't speak Japanese, I was prepared for basic things like going to the grocery store to suddenly become extremely difficult. I also knew that I didn't necessarily mind that increase in difficulty.\n6. Be honest with yourself about your mental health.  If things aren't working or your mental health is going downhill, know when to call it quits. Don't try to stick it out and recontract for another year if you're miserable.\n7. I didn't expect this situation to be easy. I knew it would be really hard. I knew I'd fail a lot. I prepared myself for that and equipped myself with the knowledge that it's ok to fail. I may have even over prepared in this respect haha. I was absolutely petrified getting on the plane to come here, but then when I got here I was pleasantly surprised to find that things weren't the absolute hellscape that I'd envisioned.

IPA and phonics are totally different. I think we're both clear on what IPA is (international, works for all languages, many symbols, etc). Phonics is language (in this case English) specific. It's basically how English speaking children learn to read.\n\nFirst you learn to associate a base sound with each letter (A...ah, ah, apple). Then you learn how to put the letter sounds together to form simple word (c, a, t... cuh, ah, tuh,....cat). Then you learn how different letter combinations cause the letter sounds to change. (ie if two vowels are next to each other, the first vowel \"says it's name\", like in meat. The vowel in meat is \\[i\\] which is also the name of the letter e).\n\nTo use your example of since vs science, someone who knows phonics would know that in since, i is on it's own, resulting in it's base sound of \\[\u026a\\], while in science it comes before an e leading it to \"say its name\" and become \\[aj\\]\n\nWhile IPA is certainly useful, it does require the word to be written in IPA. Phonics allows you to look at the word as it's written and make a pretty good (maybe not perfect, there are lots of exceptions) guess about it's pronounced. The con-truh-ver-see style of pronunciation guides are build on how basic phonics work. If you know basic phonics, you can read the 4 different syllables with a pretty high degree of accuracy.

Sarah grew up in a small town in the Midwest. All throughout her childhood her family hosted exchange students from around the world. Sarah grew up with a very international perspective and dreamed of studying abroad and working an internationally oriented job. When she arrived at college she got a job at the international student center and met even more exchange students. They all told her \"when you go abroad, do it for a year. A semester isn't enough.\" So her Junior year of college, Sarah packed her suitcases for a year in Spain, ready to live out her dream.\n\nShe hated it. She struggled with culture shock, she missed her family, and the linguistic immersion was overwhelming. By Christmas she was regretting her choice and wished she could just go home.\n\nShe stuck it out though and when she returned to the US and to her job at the International Students Center she realized something. While she had hated *being* an international student, she loves *helping* international students. She went on to get her Masters in international education and is now an advisor at a university.\n\nAll that to say, if you've been dreaming of Japan for years, only to come here and realize that living abroad is not for you, that is ok.

The readings *feel like* a graded reader to me, but it's not actually a graded reader that you can buy or anything like that. Each grade level contains about 20 different stories. The thing to keep in mind is that *they're generally not taken directly from books.* They're often abridged summaries written at the target level. For example I think I've read exerpts from A Christmas Carol like 5 times now, but each time the difficulty level, writing style, and section of the story that I'm reading has been different.\n\nI'm assuming these readings are copywrited by Kumon so you won't be able to just find them in a bookstore. If you wanted to put in the effort, I'm sure you could create an equivalent experience by very carefully and methodically checking out books from the library, starting with picture books and working your way up. You'd have to be in charge of choosing the book for yourself though\n\nThe big different between Kumon and something like Aozora is that kumon is graded in a way that makes sense for children (starts with simple themes, no real grading of the grammar) while Aozora is made for adult learners (more complex themes from the start, grading the difficulty of the grammar)\n\nAlso the links you provided are for the Japanese for Foreigners course, which is different from the [\u56fd\u8a9e course that I take](https://www.kumon.ne.jp/kyozai/kokugo/sample/index.html).

It's a lot of work, but while memorizing things is tedious, it's not the most difficult thing in the world. It's really not too much worse than a language with a really obtuse spelling system.\n2. Word order - This is quite difficult for beginners to wrap their heads around, I admit. But word order is an issue you should have adjusted to by the time you hit the intermediate stage. It's really not that difficult in a post-beginner world\n3. Transitivity Pairs/ Particles/Different (from English) Grammar - This is something I personally struggle with, but it's not something super uniquely difficult about Japanese. All languages have their annoyingly difficult grammar aspects. Really not much more difficult than declensions or case systems in other languages.\n4. Levels of Formality - This can be tricky to navigate, but the reality is that as a beginner or even intermediate learner, you won't be expected to use anything other than \u3067\u3059\u30fb\u307e\u3059 and plain form, which is pretty manageable. By the time you reach advanced and start trying to regularly use \u5c0a\u656c\u8a9e and \u8b19\u8b72\u8a9e at work, you should have enough cultural awareness to know how and when to use them.\n\nSo all in all, while there are some difficult aspects about Japanese, they're certainly manageable and aren't that much more difficult than the difficult parts of other languages.

My town actually has a policy against posting ads on job boards because they'd have to pay a fee to list the job there and the town's cheap af. When the town has an opening they put a notice in the town newsletter and post fliers at the grocery store.
