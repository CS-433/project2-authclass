You can get a small bunch for about $0.06. The process is simple but effective, several market women assured me. Take a bunch of usma and let it dry in the sun for a couple hours. Then grind up the leaves until a dark green goo seeps out. Dip a branch of usma \u2014 or a matchstick, if you want to be more precise \u2014 into the goo and smear it on your eyebrows, making sure, of course, to color the space in between. Leave on for 15 minutes, and repeat the smearing process one or two more times. The result is a deep black unibrow, rich and expressive.\n\nAsking Tajik women why they like the unibrow is a bit like asking Western women why they like to paint their nails or pluck their eyebrows into oblivion.\n\n\"I just think it's beautiful,\" was, without exception, the answer I got after asking more than a dozen Tajik women about their unibrows.\u201d", "created_utc": "1597117499.0", "edited": "False", "id": "g12g0lu", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_i7e42m", "parent_id": "t3_i7e42m", "score": "3", "subreddit": "AskCentralAsia", "subreddit_id": "t5_ujz7x"}, {"author": "keenonkyrgyzstan", "body": "I know this is supposed to be a \"jerky\" subreddit, but how about we don't gang up on a 15 year old?", "created_utc": "1597047895.0", "edited": "False", "id": "g0z4vtu", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_i6j3tu", "parent_id": "t3_i6j3tu", "score": "19", "subreddit": "languagelearningjerk", "subreddit_id": "t5_37rt5"}, {"author": "keenonkyrgyzstan", "body": "It\u2019s a shame that so much international press is dedicated to Ashgabat and the presidency, yet the world knows very little about how everyday Turkmen live.", "created_utc": "1597039022.0", "edited": "False", "id": "g0yvvcc", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_i6rjq1", "parent_id": "t1_g0yvf3r", "score": "1", "subreddit": "AskCentralAsia", "subreddit_id": "t5_ujz7x"}, {"author": "keenonkyrgyzstan", "body": "How about this: There are many \u201cweird\u201d things connected to Turkmenistan\u2019s two presidents that have been noted or even mocked in the west: the golden statues, renaming the months, the president\u2019s musical aspirations.

As others mentioned, \"khan\" is a comment component in surnames, but it's also widely used as a component in boys' first names: Alikhan, Aidarkhan, Temirkhan, etc.\n2. It seems like nobody's answered your specific question about the *process* of naming. One important tradition is that it's often the grandparents who are given the right to name the child. My wife's father was so happy to have his first child that he named her right at the hospital, and when her grandfather found out, he was so angry that he kicked my father-in-law's ass. Some other traditions are that names are sometimes inspired the baby's physical appearance (a girl with big eyes might named Botagoz, or \"Eye of a Baby Camel,\" and I once met a guy with a big mole on his face named Qalzhan, or \"Mole Soul\") and that if a couple has a girl, but they were really hoping for a boy, they'll name her something like Ulbolsyn, which means \"May the next one be a boy.\"\n3.
