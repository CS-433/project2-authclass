However, from the perspective of a language learner, you have to recognize that he basically hit the jackpot. He is native Slovak, Czech, and Hungarian and also learned German and English because of his life circumstances. If I remember correctly, he spent time in Germany when he was an adolescent and went to high school in New Jersey of all places. In other words, his life put him in situations where by the time he was a teenager he already had four languages from different spheres of the IE branch, ranging from the super inflected Slavic languages, German in the middle, and the English at the other end with its reliance on syntax, prepositions, and heavy dose of Latin vocabulary. Combine all this with Hungarian, and the guy was practically born to conquer European languages, which is precisely what he decided to do.\n\nI'm pretty sure the first language he actively sought out to study was Italian which he was able to do in-country as an exchange student. He's described Italian as a 'medium' difficulty language for him at the time and him taking the time to take his Italian to a C level further facilitated his language learning process with other Romane languages. \n\n  \nVlad's biggest accomplishment as a language learner is his Mandarin Chinese. He has spoken very candidly about how challenging it was to bring his Chinese to the level it is, going as far as to say, \"[It was only after I learned Mandarin that I actually realized what it is to study a foreign language](https://youtu.be/mvcLuTTn9p8?t=106).\" In other words, because of the guy's background, he never even saw other European languages as other languages really. \n\nThis is super, super important for you to understand because this is precisely why YOU CANNOT COMPARE YOUR LANGUAGE LEARNING WITH OTHERS. I really, really cannot emphasize this enough. You are learning your first, Vlad was born into three and was forced to acquire two more. If you want to be more like them, then heed their advice because they both have tremendous insight and very practical advice.

While I'm sure that's a factor, it's a comparatively minor one. If that were the sole factor, there should be droves more Japanese-speaking Spanish speakers. \n\nYes, Chinese certainly has its advantages as well with it's use of characters and common vocabulary. Still, the structure of the language is widely different.\n\nRyukyuan languages are genetic siblings, but this isn't necessarily and indication of ease of learning. Icelandic and German are genetically much closer to English than the Romance languages, yet French and Spanish are generally considered much easier than those other two for a native English speaker. Having said that, the dearth of learning resources, speakers, and media make these not very likely.\n\nIn my opinion, the easiest language for a monolingual Japanese speaker to learn would have to have an abundance of resources, media, and people to speak with as well as commonality in grammar/logic of the language. Relatively similar phonology and a phonetic writing system are great bonuses. These leads me to Finnish, Turkish, and Korean. Between these three, Korean clearly stands out. The grammar and logic of the language is the closest, is within the Chinese/East Asian cultural sphere, shares a ton of vocab, and has a pronunciation that is much more similar than it differs.\n\nTurkish would probably be a runner up seeing as the word order is more similar to Japanese than Finnish. Finnish does have a little bit of a leg up in that it also has vowel and consonant length just like Japanese.\n\nSo in conclusion, I believe that if you had three monolingual Japanese students of similar cabability and motivation with equal quality in study methods,, the student of Korean would make progress the most swiftly, followed by the student of Turkish, and then lastly the student of Finnish. Chinese gets an honorable mention because a Japanese student wouldn't have to devote nearly as much time to studying characters and vocab.\n\nTDRL: 1. Korean, 2. Turkish, 3. Finnish, 4.

First and foremost, each unit is not a real conversation exactly. Rather, it is a random, hodgepodge of unrelated two-sentence dialogs cobbled together, closer to something like Glossika. It would have been far better to make each lesson a genuine conversation a la Assimil or Linguaphone or like the dialog sections of Genki or JFE. Second, and less importantly, each little dialog is interrupted by a Japanese voice chiming in to say the number of the next dialog. It's completely unnecessary and brakes the flow of listening.\n\nWith the negatives out of way, let's say the positives! I will say is that I love the form factor of the book itself. It's light, feels good in the hand, and is super portable. I really, really appreciate the layout as well; having the Japanese text on the one side and the translation on the other should be the only way dialogs are formatted in language books. I'm probably switching to use this as my primary study method specifically because of this. I'm on lesson five of Japanese for Everyone and they almost always have the English translation on a different page! It's infuriating. The text itself is sharp and very easy on the eyes as well.\n\nSound quality is great, entirely in Japanese with the text using kanji from the beginning. This book is equally good for building reading fluency as well as speaking fluency and listening comprehension, basically functioning as a graded reader with full audio. As the lessons progress, dialogs get more complicated and longer making a nice learning curve. The beginning of each dialog also marks there register as informal, formal, or mixed register. There is NO grammar explanation at all in the book, which for me is a positive. Using a material like this, I just want to be engaged with the Japanese text.\n\nIf I'm using a l-r method for Japanese rather than a traditional style textbook, I'm probably going to use this course. The recordings in Assimil are far too slow and the Linguaphone course doesn't use Japanese script at all. If the recordings of the Assimil course were re-recorded at a more natural pace, that would easily be my primary Japanese resource. As is, Shadowing: Let's Speak Japanese combined with a reference grammar when necessary seems like a really solid way to get started in the language or to improve your reading, listening, and speaking skills.

The dialogs are recorded so terribly slow that it's practically unlistenable.

There are more grammar explanations and exercises as well. I found the audio online and bought the book for $7 on barnes and noble's website. Hard to argue with that.\n\nI've heard good things about Linguaphone, though unfortunately it's entirely romanized. This is weird because in every one of their other non-Latin script language course (Chinese, Korean, Arabic, Russian, etc), the dialogs are written in the appropriate scripts. JFE is also a single text while the Linguaphone course has the Japanese and English translation are in two separate books. I recently bought Shadowing Japanese, but I haven't checked it out yet. \n\nThese aren't deal-breakers IMO, but it's enough to make me recommend JFE first. Keep in mind that the focus of these courses is really developing comprehensible input through audio and reading exposure rather than grammar exercises or vocab lists to memorize. This is my preferred style so I'm biased toward JFE for my Japanese studies.\n\nAs for Genki, it very much a traditional textbook through and through. If you are down with vocab memorization, writing exercises, and detailed explanations then it may be for you. It's generally considered the most beginner-friendly introductory text. I prefer courses that focus on dialog comprehension personally, but many others really enjoy this book, especially here on r/LearnJapanese. To be clear, there is audio for the dialogs that you could use to employ a similar approach as Assimil or JFE, it's just not the focus.

I'll tone it down.\n\nUnfortunately, the difficulty of language learning can't be qualified with a checklist. Having fewer verb conjugations is not a real metric for language difficulty. If this were the case, people wouldn't be struggling so badly to learn Chinese. Coincidentally, I know Spanish as a second language. I promise you, your knowledge of Spanish and it's influence on your learning English cannot be overstated. There are so many parallels between the two that it's really more like you're just learning what's different. When I speak Spanish, I sometimes feel more like I'm speaking the same language with different words (this has created some bad habits like using 'poder' or 'para' more than a native speaker typically would, but it's not incorrect either).\n\nFor the written language, again, don't take for granted how being a Spanish speaker has helped you here. I am an ESL teacher and my Chinese students still regularly confuse letters like f and t, d and p and b, k and x, etc after years of study. Then you got capital letters with sometimes don't resemble the minuscule forms at all, digraphs and other letter combinations that change sounds like -ough, -tion, French loan words that we still basically use with the French pronunciation, and vowels that you often have to memorize for a given word, etc. It's excruciating for Japanese learners.\n\nThere are so many things that the Japanese/non-Indo European language speakers struggle with when learning English apart from the spelling. The irregularity of verbs, prepositions, and articles; the multitude of dialects; the word order; dummy pronouns; mass nouns; the logic and forms of expression. This last one to me in particular I feel is the biggest challenge. Consider the Spanish expression, \"no hay mal que por bien no venga\". When I came across this phrase for the first time while reading a Spanish books, it was completely incompatible with my brain. I knew all the words well enough, I could see that \"venir\" was in the subjunctive, but translated literally word for word it comes into English as gibberish. This is from a language that is genetically and culturally very close to English. Now consider a Japanese person learning English. The number of expressions and constructions that have no lateral translation are far, far greater. You just have to learn the meaning of the phrase and ignore the individual meanings of the words. But this is incredibly challenging in the beginning because as language learners, we seek out words first to comprehend and derive meaning and then plug it into the larger construction. \n\n\\> English is also a lot more explicit and doesn't rely on context nearly  as much as Japanese does, so that layer of complexity isn't going to  affect a Japanese speaker as much as it does an English speaker. \n\nThis is a good example as to why you can't really make a 1-1 comparison as to which is more difficult for whom. In the minds of a Japanese speaker, *they are being perfectly explicit.* When a Japanese person learns English, they have to learn how to make themselves \"more explicit\" by the conventions of western culture, and it is not easy at all.\n\nAnywho, the point being is that there really isn't any logical basis to say that it's easier for \"this\" person to learn \"this\" language because \"this\"; it's almost never that simple. Polish seems like it would be a nightmare to learn *for me as a native English speaker*, but for a Russian or a Slovak person, it would be one of the easiest, far more so than English. Far and away, the biggest factor (apart from motivation) in the difficulty of learning a given language is not the number of verb conjugations or cases or articles, but just how similar it is to your native language. In the case of English and Japanese, the distance is equal in both directions.\n\nI hope this response was a little more articulate and less dickish than my initial post lol.", "created_utc": "1580209906.0", "edited": "False", "id": "fft6p3e", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_eurota", "parent_id": "t1_ffsca4o", "score": "1", "subreddit": "LearnJapanese", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qyls"}, {"author": "thevagrant88", "body": ">Of course it will be difficult for a Japanese person since it's very different to their native language, but it's definitely not as hard as it would be for a native English speaker to learn Japanese.\n\nSo, this is a load.

Am I wrong about that?\n\nYes. In short, European Spanish has been the dominant version of Spanish used in gaming since the beginning. It's very common for big games with international releases to only have European Spanish as an option. The Resident Evil 2 remake is a recent example I can think of off the top off my head. Very often, if there is LA Spanish as an option, it exists alongside European Spanish version. God of War  and Zelda Breath of the Wild are recent examples of this. So in other words, most Spanish speaking gamers are accustomed to European Spanish in their games. \n\nSometimes this has created some rather goofy situations, such a Grim Fandango. If you're familiar with the game, it deals heavily with Mexico culture and folklore, yet the Spanish localization is in European Spanish! Could you imagine if a Japanese game company made a game that took place in Alabama, but everyone had Australian accents? It's that weird. The point is, Spanish speaking gamers are used to it.\n\n> what do you think about European vs. Latin American spanish? What is a higher priority?\n\nIt's really not that big off a deal, doubly so for an entirely text-based game. The only majorish difference is that EU Spanish has an extra second-person plural pronoun with it's own verb conjugation. Either way, everybody would understand everything just fine, it is all Spanish after all. I'd just go with who you worked with before since you already have a working relationship with that translator/company.\n\nHoped this helped!", "created_utc": "1578511303.0", "edited": "False", "id": "fdkub0x", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_ek7cib", "parent_id": "t1_fdkgwg7", "score": "1", "subreddit": "roguelikedev", "subreddit_id": "t5_2si41"}, {"author": "thevagrant88", "body": "I want to thank you for taking the time to translate the game into Spanish despite there being no obvious financial boost from Spain. I hope that Latin American sales or sales from Spanish speakers in the USA (there are over 50 million of us here) helped recoup your losses.\n\nI participated in that discussion on Steam and there a few things I'd like to point out. I said I hoped for a Spanish translation while I already had a copy of the game. I feel that many people who participated in that discussion also already owned the game as well. The translation didn't get a sale out of me, rather it had me enjoy the game far more. It must have been a bit misleading because if you were basing your decision on that thread alone then it probably wasn't an accurate basis to form sales projections.\n\nThe other thing to point out, I had *no idea* the translation was finished. I checked the language options on the main steam page many times to see if Spanish support was added. I didn't find out until months later that Spanish support was added to the game BECAUSE IT WASN'T LISTED ON THE STEAM PAGE LANGUAGE OPTIONS! There was a small announcement, but the steam page itself was not updated at all for a very long time. I don't know if you were aware of that or not. So not only did the information not reach me, it wasn't even present when I sought it out in what I felt was the clearest way to check.\n\nI don't think that the problem was whether to make a Spanish translation or not, but rather the way it was done. By the time Spanish was added, many people probably either moved on to another game or tried to play in English as best they could. If you look at Spanish guides or playthroughs on youtube, most of them are from when the game came out, meaning the youtuber is speaking and explaining things in Spanish but playing in English. By the time the Spanish translation was released, the gaming world had kinda moved on. Then it was made worse for the people who did have an interest in the game because we had NO CLUE that the Spanish translation was done. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'd bet that if the Spanish translation was done durring the development process, available at the time of release,  been widely known about at time of the release, and if you directed your analytics to the massive Spanish-speaking gaming community outside of Spain, your efforts would have been far more fruitful. I hope you don't abandon Spanish for Tangledeep 2 and I'd be more than happy to help make it happen any way I can.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\u00a1Much\u00edsimas gracias por todos tus esfuerzos y buena suerte con Tangledeep 2 and Puzzle Explores!", "created_utc": "1578484911.0", "edited": "False", "id": "fdjrmg2", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_ek7cib", "parent_id": "t3_ek7cib", "score": "1", "subreddit": "roguelikedev", "subreddit_id": "t5_2si41"}, {"author": "thevagrant88", "body": "This sounds perfect!

The design of the game basically goes back and forth between walking, stealthy or shooting section, walking, stealth or shooting section, repeat. Throw in required cutscenes and that's the gameplay structure of the entire game. Very little in the way of surprises and consequently, kinda boring.\n\nI've never seen anyone else mention this before, but I've had a few instances where the game kinda broke on me.

Instead of restarting the section, I respawned right were I died, effectively passing the section by failing.\n\nAs mentioned, the fact that Ellie is completely incapable of alerting enemies, even when walking into them, is pretty inexcusable. Combined with the fact that many of the stealthy sections are filled with enemies who don't detect you only because they are staring at their feet or straight up into the sky/ceiling tells me that the designers had to have been aware of these shortcomings.\n\nEven with my problems, I don't think TLoU is a bad game. But it's far from a perfect, generation defining game it's made out to be. The whole conanization of some games is really annoying. No games are beyond scrutiny and I really wish more mainstream publications had more divergent opinions with one another and examined the flaws of alleged classics in a way that reaches a larger audience outside Reddit comments.", "created_utc": "1573140280.0", "edited": "False", "id": "f6svcjf", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_dsqy4z", "parent_id": "t1_f6rd0xz", "score": "2", "subreddit": "truegaming", "subreddit_id": "t5_2sgq6"}, {"author": "thevagrant88", "body": "Do it and make a vowel sound at the same time.", "created_utc": "1573126950.0", "edited": "False", "id": "f6s4osg", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_dsr6vn", "parent_id": "t1_f6s3ep3", "score": "1", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "thevagrant88", "body": "Honestly, the massive disparity of reviews makes me want to play it that much more.

To do otherwise, isn't completely studying the languages in my mind.\n\nObviously, how somebody decides to read AG will never affect me or anybody else in the slightest. Having said that, I would always encourage language students of any language to pronounce it was it was/is spoken and to learn the differences in the sounds between a shared script. \n\nWhenever somebody studies a language that shares a common alphabet, it is expected to learn the differences in vowel qualities, stress pattern, digraphs, \"trouble consonant letters\", diacritic marks, etc that we see when we read. By trouble consonant letters, I refer to letters that regularly represent different sounds between different languages, such as -r, -j, -y, -w, -c, and -h.

The point is that female characters are being overtly sexualized at all, not who is finding them attractive (though demographic absolutely is adolescent males). The overwhelmingly majority of these artists are men, men who are channeling overtly sexual overtones in there designs in a way that objectifies women. It reinforces societal images and demands for what an ideal woman should be. Like I said in the other post, it is the result of a patriarchal system and is far from egalitarian. This is men saying what women look like. \n\nConsider motivation for a moment too. Why is this so common? Designing females characters like this across entire media hasn't added anything other then making them pretty to look at, and it's frequently inappropriate. Remember that example I gave about back to the future? It's inappropriate because it not only fails to enhance the story, but it distracts from it. Now if you have an entire media culture churning out women characters while literally making them objects, that's a negative thing in the world of gender equality. If this trend were to stop, I only good would come of it and nothing bad.\n\nAnd you're asking for a false equivalent. I didn't say there is anything wrong with sexual media. Quite the contrary. Some of the greatest works of art and literature are highly sexual and deal with sexuality in ways that are provacative, insightful, and not exploitive. My issue is a media culture that fosters gender inequality by promoting a mentality that increases women's value based on their looks and sexual merrit.

The fact that women are overwhelmingly portrayed in Japanese media; specifically in gaming, anime, and manga; is telling of a patriarchal bias. You almost never see this conversation happen about male characters having their dongs flopping around. The sexuality of these characters is almost never elaborated on or delt with in a tactful, mature way, they just got their tits barely covered and three sizes too big. They are only drawn this way to appeal to adolescente males, not add a nuanced layer of sexual depth to the character. If it's an attempt to add sexual nuance, it's a highly artificial and juvenile one.\n\nFor me personally, it's just fucking weird. Think about it, imagine you are watching Back to the Future and for no explicable reason, Biff is shredded and only wearing a speedo he entire movie. Nobody seems to notice though, it's just the reality of this version of 1980s America. Biff and maybe Doc Brown are in speedos with massive packages.
