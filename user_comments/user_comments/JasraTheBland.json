For certain things to make sense, you have to know a bit about the structure of the Portuguese Empire. Early Angola was almost a colony of a colony of Portugal (which was itself a UK client state in the latter centuries), and when Brazil became independent (under a neo-Portuguese monarchy), they explicitly rejected the possibility of a South Atlantic union with the other Portuguese colonies (primary: Treaty of Rio de Janeiro 1825). The 1600s Dutch-Portuguese war will show why this was something the Portuguese were worried enough about to write it into the independence agreement.\n\nWhen the UK starting pushing for abolition, this made the Brazilian elite very angry (because they liked to work their slaves to death and consequently need a constant supply) , but the best they could do was just pretend like they were working on it until the UK started boarding their ships . (British-Brazilian Treaty of 1826, Aberdeen Act of 1845, secondary: The Abolition of the Brazilian Slave Trade). So into the late 19th century, Brazil maintained a distinction between Creole slaves born in Brazil, and people imported directly from Africa. To this day, \"crioulo\" is a super offensive thing to call a black person in Brazil, which can be kinda surprising because it doesn't carry the same weight in Cabo Verde, where it's closer to what \"Creole\" means in Louisiana or Martinique. After the slave trade ends for good and the Scramble for Africa happens, Africa becomes basically irrelevant to Brazilian foreign policy for several decades.\n\nMeanwhile in the 30s, the sociologist Gilberto Freyre and dictator Get\u00falio Vargas help popularize the idea of \"racial democracy\".  You can read Casa-Grande e Senzala, but finding a summary would probably be more relevant. Basically, there is a sub argument that one of the reasons that Brazil is so mixed is that Portuguese people a unique miscegenation-based power to civilize \"uncivilized peoples\". Freyre eventually goes to Portugal and sells \"luso-tropicalism\" to the Portuguese Estado Novo, who uses it as a thin cover for continuing the Portuguese Empire when decolonization picks up. If Freyre's ideas seemed kinda sorta plausible in Latin America, they made absolutely no sense at all in Africa, where the Portuguese Empire was closer to apartheid than to Brazil. \"Luso-tropicalism and Its Discontents: The Making and Unmaking of Racial Exceptionalism \" tackles some of the broader effects and reactions to Freyre.\n\nStarting in the 50s and 60s, Brazil develops an on-again off-again \"Independent Foreign Policy\" based on not just doing whatever Europe or the US say (this is a reasonable concept, but the execution is where the mental gymnastics really pick up). One of the flashpoints ends up being decolonization in Africa, and Hotel Tr\u00f3pico by Jerry Davila covers how luso-tropicalism lead to high-level contradictions. Other highlights include the right-wing Brazilian military dictatorship, which itself was overall supported by the U.S and fiercely anti-communist in Brazil, recognizing the Communist MPLA in Angola and FRELIMO in Mozambique and supporting them in the resulting civil wars against opposition groups supported by the U.S and South Africa.  At the time, Brazil was still quite poor, and the support was mostly symbolic (unlike Cuba, who sent battalions to Angola).\n\nBrazil was also pursuing nukes at the time, as part of an arms race with Argentina, and briefly considered working with apartheid South Africa, but ultimately decided against it due to apartheid and said civil wars in Southern Africa. (South Africa did end up building the nukes secretly and later unilaterally dismantled them when apartheid was ending).\n\nIn more recent years, Brazil's involvement has been more economic than political. In the 60s, the wealth gap between Brazil and Sub-Saharan) Africa was much smaller,  but Brazil's massive economic growth has heavily tilted the balance in Brazil's favor. With the BRICS mindset, the government maintained the narrative of \"South-South cooperation\" (at its height during the Lula years). There are some genuinely good things that came out of that (especially in the fields of health and education), but they also sent over some of the world's largest multinational corporations, like Vale and Odebrecht, to do basically the same stuff as all the other multinational corporations, and swore it was completely different because \"we are basically in the same boat\". \"Debunking Brazilian Exceptionalism in its Africa Relations\" is a good place to start.  Also the news from the last decade about Vale in Mozambique, the Luanda Leaks, and the Odebrecht slave labor case ([they went full circle](https://www.business-humanrights.org/en/latest-news/odebrecht-lawsuit-re-forced-labour-in-angola/)).\n\nKeep in mind the demographics differences between Brazil's elite and the country as a whole (Two Brazils/Belindia).", "created_utc": "1650116210.0", "edited": "1650118244.0", "id": "i4yf5u7", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_u49bx5", "parent_id": "t1_i4wsyt0", "score": "4", "subreddit": "asklatinamerica", "subreddit_id": "t5_fda8k"}, {"author": "JasraTheBland", "body": "I can see how pardo + preto = negro is annoying, but the Brazilian government does like to hype up Brazil's \"largest African-descended population outside of Africa\" claim with that logic specifically. \"Black and Brown\" is an expression that people sometimes use as basically a politer way of saying \"not white (and sometimes not East Asian)\\*\" and would be more accurate", "created_utc": "1650061023.0", "edited": "False", "id": "i4vxrr4", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_u49bx5", "parent_id": "t1_i4ughn7", "score": "3", "subreddit": "asklatinamerica", "subreddit_id": "t5_fda8k"}, {"author": "JasraTheBland", "body": "It's really complicated, and at the end of the day, Brazil has to find Brazilian solutions for a Brazilian problem. As a Black American, people who treat the Brazilian Black consciousness movement as purely an American import annoy me because there have been explicitly racial movements in Brazil since slavery was still in living memory there. For example, some Brazilians are really militant about \"palmitagem\"/\"swirling\"/miscegenation, which  is attributed to the US but is not mainstream there, and the US is (gradually) shifting from a Black-White-Other framework to something fuzzier and more multifaceted. However, if you consider that the Brazilian government explicitly did try to breed out the black out one point, it's more understandable why that particular stance is gaining traction there, even if you ultimately don't agree with it. Similarly, people were surprised by the Afro-Brazilian reaction to Black Panther, but Brazil had huge cities of maroons during the colonial era, and the story of Palmares is true history that more people outside of Brazil should know. If you can read Portuguese, there's a lot of Afro-Brazilian thought on the situation there that at times interlaces with and at times diverges from other African Diaspora lines of thought.   \n\n\nI don't think they can just copy-paste American politics, but there is room from dialog and inspiration. For better or worse, state-directed integration has made the upper echelons of American society much more accessible to the Black American upper classes (and also helped contribute to the cyclic poverty of the Black lower classes).

Portuguese (as Old Galician) changed more than Spanish (Castillian) until about 1000-1200 A.D. Portuguese developed nasals, but it only simplified Latin's 10 oral vowels to 7, like Italian. Spanish ultimately simplified them to 5, with open e and o becoming dipthongs. Spanish and Portuguese both had lenition, apocope, syncope (getting rid of unstressed vowels, resulting in final consonants and vowel clusters) and intervocalic voicing, but Spanish also saw the initial f become silent. They both merged a bunch of cl/pl/fl clusters ( into  \u0283 in Portuguese )but  they became \u028e (ll) in Spanish while many of the li  became  \u0292 (j), which ultimately merged with \u0283 (x) into jota.

In most of the modern Spanish speaking world /b/ and /v/ are merged, /s/ and /z/ are merged, and /\u028e/ and /j/ are merged.

If French were written phonetically, all of the homophones and vowel shifts would make it much less familiar to another Romance speaker. The preterite, imperfect subjunctive and past conditional  are widely used in other languages but literary in French, the future subjunctive doesn't exist and half of the time, the past particle, infinitive, imperfect sound the same, gender is marked by consonants, and pluralization effectively happens at the front of the word via liason.

To turn Italian (Portuguese) into French (Spanish) you chop some stuff off (merge a bunch of sounds) and get a bunch of homophones. Obviously it's more complicated, but that's the general idea. To use French for Italian or Spanish or Portuguese, you have to do a bit more memorization.

My problem mainly comes up when people don't acknowledge that the way a lot human rights/culture/environment talk goes isn't just that the West did it first and then learned better. It's that the West did it, learned better, proceded to accept all the benefits of gross abuses without making tangible concessions to the harmed minorities, and then spends more time/energy talking about how bad China is than actively trying to remediate the harm it's done to its own minorities. \n\nI say this as someone who speaks a critically endangered language from the U.S. Yes, minority communities are making significant gains in protecting their heritage, but going from actively beating language out of kids to *just* neglect isn't enough in my opinion. I'm not saying that this particular sub doesn't have people working to change that, just commenting on the way \"China is violently imposing a national language\" fits into the broader discourse in countries that only stopped beating their minorities once they achieved China's current goal. No, that doesn't mean people can't be concerned about both China and the rest of the world, just a reflection that a lot of people's concern isn't genuine. \n\nLike u/millionsofcats said, a reasonable response would be \"so what can we do about this?\" For most people, it will be really hard to change Chinese policy from outside of China, but there are ways you can do things in your own country that could help minorities there.
