Assuming you're not in medicine, you couldn't walk into a hospital in your native country and truly understand what the medical professionals were saying to each other, but that doesn't mean you're not a native speaker...

I also read some general articles on pronunciation which helped simplify it and used Forzo to hear word pronunciation if my (Native Polish) wife wasn't around to help. Once you've got your mouth around the grouped sounds (I.e. dzie, przy, sz (a hard 'sh') vs \u015b (a softer 'shee') etc.) and work out how you break down Polish words into syllables (usually on each vowel) and that the stress is generally on the penultimate syllable it does get easier! I look at English spellings compared with their pronunciation now and think \"wtf, this is so complicated compared to Polish!\" \ud83d\ude01\n\nListening to music in Polish has also helped massively and been a really fun way to practice by trying to sing along. Find out what bands your partner likes and explore Polish artists in your preferred genre. I listen to the Antyradio 'Made in Poland' station at work which is mostly Polish classics and a good place to start. I use Readlang (like a free version of LingQ) to sync song lyrics with their youtube video and then play it back slowly and sing along until I can go at full speed.\n\nI'm really jealous that you and your partner have found a way to work on your Polish together in a fun way!
