It also is quite noticeable when you hear the language, it makes it sound kind of singsongy.\n\nI'm not sure I agree there are that few languages that use tones, the Chinese languages, Cantonese, Vietnamese, Thai, Japanese, Swedish, Norwegian, a lot of African languages, I think it's more wide spread than you may have realised.\n\nI'd say that even vowel length is something English speakers often have issues with, my language uses it a lot, and like tones it's totally changing things, as with tones the words change completely and it's hard to figure out, so lege (long e) and legge (short e) means doctor, and lie down/put to bed, hope (long o) bunch up and hoppe (short o) means to jump. For me having grown up with it they sound really different, for people learning it seems to be hard. Again as with tones people try to copy it, doesn't get it right and it's difficult, same with vowels quality and so on, languages just have so many facets that are hard to differentiate if you aren't used to them, the thing is, they are neither subtle, not small, We're just not used to them, but we can get used to them and see them easily, we can train our ears to hear them better.\n\nI think the issue was more that we were talking about different things i think, the thing is, of course you'll find it harder to read something you probably only have spent a couple of hundred hours on than something you have literally tens of thousands of hours of practicing with.", "created_utc": "1666294136.0", "edited": "False", "id": "it3ye43", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_y8atm0", "parent_id": "t1_it3q13c", "score": "2", "subreddit": "shorthand", "subreddit_id": "t5_2u0w5"}, {"author": "sotolf2", "body": "Well, then a dictionary works way better, since it gives you multiple definitions, trying our cookies in English gives you only the edible ones, not the internet one, back up gives you only the copying files to a different place one, not backing up with a car and so on, i might be old fashioned, bit nothing really breasts a dictionary :)", "created_utc": "1666288128.0", "edited": "False", "id": "it3iy3s", "is_submitter": "True", "link_id": "t3_y8s9gx", "parent_id": "t1_it3cegd", "score": "3", "subreddit": "shorthand", "subreddit_id": "t5_2u0w5"}, {"author": "sotolf2", "body": "Well, a couple of these points are rather English centric, my mother tongue which I mostly write steno in has an orthography that is closer to the spoken language than what English is, so that alleviates some of the points.\n\nFor distinctness most cursive systems have own signs for di and trigraphs that commonly occurs, which while initially a bit challenging helps a lot with getting rid of confusing or hard to write joins.\n\nI don't think there are many systems at all that doesn't have any distinction in either length, position or shading really.\n\nAlso again since my mother tongue has a closer relationship between orthography and spoken you can write to a standard that is dictated by the system, rather than having to write some dialectal variant, although I like using that as a device for shortening down stuff, but growing up in a country with huge dialectal variance it's something you just get used to.\n\nI do speak a tonal language, and the difficulty does not lie in small changes, rather in that they said a word that doesn't belong, and I have to start backtracking figuring out what they meant, also the lack of time makes it flat and uncomfortable to listen to.\n\nAgain, the rest of your points also are just as much part of symbolic shorthands as cursive shorthands, so I don't really get why they are brought up", "created_utc": "1666286726.0", "edited": "False", "id": "it3fbiu", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_y8atm0", "parent_id": "t1_it38sy2", "score": "2", "subreddit": "shorthand", "subreddit_id": "t5_2u0w5"}, {"author": "sotolf2", "body": "Honestly, mostly I'm just using unlined paper, even for systems like W-K which are quite dependent on a writing line, as long as you manage to keep normal handwriting decently straight it's usually not that much of a problem in my experience.", "created_utc": "1666274794.0", "edited": "False", "id": "it2kvsj", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_y8i19a", "parent_id": "t3_y8i19a", "score": "0", "subreddit": "shorthand", "subreddit_id": "t5_2u0w5"}, {"author": "sotolf2", "body": "Now, this starts to make me curious about symbolic vs cursive shorthand systems, for some reason I have the feeling that the cursive systems are easier to read back, it might just be that I have more exposure to them, but I find their shapes and how they are built up to make briefs and words that are easier to recognise than the symbolic ones.

The words all follow the same pitch pattern, or they will sound off, it's usually a way to pick out non-natives, since they have a harder time when their language has no tonality.\n\n> ow of course this might only be the perception of this guy, but other Swedes that I have asked have confirmed that the pitch accent doesnt matter in all words and that it sounds weird when you pronounce it even if it is the correct pattern, which to me means that the distinction in meaning between words that sometimes happens is really not all that important and more a product of how the individual patterns get assigned.\n\nMost people who grew up with the language don't even perceive the tonem patterns, since it's something we grew up with, what they perceive as no tone is just that the words follow the patterns they are used to.\n\nThe tonem does matter in the way that the word sounds off when you say it wrong, most people are used to the tonem so they don't really think of it when they say it it follows the normal flow, so to them since it doesn't sound off they don't hear it. That was the case for me too until I actively started listening for them, and did it for a long time.\n\nThe distinction is important because it sounds wrong when you say it wrong, it's quite strong of you to tell native speakers of a language what it's important for them or not. That's like saying vowels doesn't matter for English because so many of them gets reduced to schwa's anyway. I don't really get this.\n\n> Also the thing with the emphasis might only be the interaction between stress and pitch accent in Swedish in particular. If you say that Norwegian has both stress and pitch accent too and that doesnt happen there then I suppose that is not a feature inherent to classifying a language as having pitch accent in and of itself but just something that happens in certain languages that have tones.\n\nI think it has to do with how much someone has actively thought about how they use the language, if there is something you use instinctively because you have spoken the language from birth of course you don't really think about it because it's second nature to them, but try to go to the people that say it doesn't matter and pronounce a word with the wrong tonem and they will try to correct your pronounciation and feel that something is off with how you pronounced the word. They will get what you try to say, because usually the words that have tonem differences can also be figured out from the context.", "created_utc": "1663945822.0", "edited": "False", "id": "iplrre9", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_xkzypg", "parent_id": "t1_iplnwca", "score": "2", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "sotolf2", "body": "> What I meant was a certain pitch pattern is a property of a whole word \n\nThat I would kind of agree with yes, but I don't see how that matters? You also have tonal differences that goes over more than one word. \n\n> If you prominently pronounce the pitch pattern of every single word in a sentence that will sound quite weird.\n\nI'm not quite sure what you mean here, it would surely sound like you're talking at someone that don't master the language, or that you're trying to be extremely clear, but using the wrong pattern for the word will not make it less emphasised, it makes it the wrong word.\n\n>  Instead certain words get the accent depending on prosody. \n\nI'm not sure why you changed from pitch to accent here. Prosody also has little bearing on the pitch pattern of a word, a word will have the same pitch pattern no matter what is around it or where in the sentence it is, sure some times for some speakers it will be more or less prominent, and in Norwegian the pitchpattern will be different depending on you're having a tonem1 or tonem2 dialect. But that doesn't change that for example you won't be able to use tonem 1 for a tonem 2 word and not change the meaning of the word. \n\n>  If you want to emphasise a word that word in particular gets a clear pitch accent for example and some others might not be distinguishable pattern wise at all.\n\nNo, to emphesise a word, like English We use stress and not tone, as the tone is a property of the ord, and you can't change it and still keep it the same word. If you say the word with the wrong tone pattern the word will not be the same.\n\n>  gets a clear pitch accent for example and some others might not be distinguishable pattern wise at all.\n\nagain I'm not sure what you mean here, all words have a tonem pattern, you might be unable to hear it, but the word sounds wrong if you use it with the wrong tonem.\n\n>  Of course the whole point is moot for the initial discussion anyway now.\n\nI'm not part of the initial discussion, I've only been discussing this point, and it's what I'm interested in :p", "created_utc": "1663939502.0", "edited": "False", "id": "iplehf3", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_xkzypg", "parent_id": "t1_ipldatw", "score": "1", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "sotolf2", "body": "> My argument was that pitch accent is mainly not used to distinguish meaning but is instead more used as a unit for emphasis and blends into the surrounding sentence the way prosodic stress does. \n\nWhich is faulty, if you change the pitch of the word it won't change emphasis, it will change the meaning of the word.

I know I\u2019m not going to pick it up overnight but I don\u2019t mind working at it if it will help me with the goals above.\n\nYeah, pretty accurate, just keep in mind that learning a shorthand often is a long effort, sure you can learn the basics in a week or two, but to get to a place where it can replace your normal handwriting in speed and readability, would be at best a couple of months, so be aware that it will be quite an effort in learning, but for you I kind of feel like it would be worth it.\n\n> How important is penmanship to shorthand? Or perhaps: Which systems are best if your handwriting is not particularly precise? I\u2019ve seen that some systems use cues like line width and I really don\u2019t think I can pull that off balancing a notebook in one hand while walking and listening at the same time.\n\nIt's decently important, but personally I have pretty rubbish penmanship, and I can still write in a way that makes me able to read it back months or even years later.\n\n> How well does shorthand work in niche fields that it wasn\u2019t developed for? Could I apply or adapt a system to the unique vocabulary I\u2019m dealing with?\n\nMost people end up with making their own shortcuts for stuff that are common in their field, so it's very much something that you'd be likely to do, just to make sure that you can read it back later, it might be wise to keep up a list of shortforms for vocabulary that you use often, so that you will not end up being in a place where you can't really understand your notes in case you put them aside for a long time, but, yeah most people end up with having some quite specialised \"versions\" of their chosen shorthand.\n\n> I think an orthographic system would suit me better than a phonetic one. Any recommendations? Is Orthic the place to start?\n\nOrthic is a very good place to start, it's a nice system, and it will probably take a bit less time to get started with, if you're like me you'll probably end up with drifting towards writing more phonetically anyway to save some space, but it's a very decent start, the glyphs are chosen well, and it has some easily accessible learning material now since [sonofherobrine made his site about the system](https://orthic.shorthand.fun)\n\nHave fun, and don't be afraid to ask questions if something is unclear :)", "created_utc": "1656918940.0", "edited": "False", "id": "iesjcfj", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_vqvu9b", "parent_id": "t3_vqvu9b", "score": "6", "subreddit": "shorthand", "subreddit_id": "t5_2u0w5"}, {"author": "sotolf2", "body": "Maybe he wanted to block me and mixed up the two scandinavs?

Synonymes are words that have the same meaning, the connotations for great feeling and fun are different, as well as stress and \"not fun\" also, why are you only willing to discuss your misrepresentation of what I said rather than what I actually said?\n\n> But guess what, they are in this context.\n\nNope they aren't, and neither were they meant as such.\n\n> And that isn't going to change no matter how much you're trying to act like i'm the one who can't stop arguing.\n\nAgain, you are only willing to talk about your misrepresentation of what I said rather than just discussing what I actually said, no need to be so disingenous.\n\n> How on earth am i making stuff up when you actually admit this is what you said? \n\n?? When I admit what is what I said? I did tell you what I said, and it's not the one you're discussing.\n\n> Leave all the rest out of it, focus on your initial comment and tell me how i am wrong.\n\nYou discuss your misrepresentation of what I said rather than just discussing the thing I actually said, if you'd be willing to talk about what I said rather than your misrepresentation maybe we'd get somewhere.\n\n> ou continue to act like i am misreading it and am somehow trying to make you look bad (what reason do i have for that??), but you offer no idea as to where i go wrong\n\nThen why do you change my quote every time you discuss about it, bringing in words I never said, like \"fun\" and \"unfun\" that changes the meaning?\n\n> You made a rude and pointless comment and presented it as feedback. I called you out on it and urged OP to ignore negativity. It could and should have ended there.\n\nI am a mod here, you're not, stop telling me what I did or not, you're the one imagining my rudeness and taking offence on the behalf of someone who aren't part of this discussion, what are you trying to achieve by that, other than trying to provoke a ban? I'm not going to ban you out of pettiness, but it seems like what you're trying to do here \n\n> Spare me the crap that you are saving the sub from advertisement. If that was the case, you could have gone a little more in depth as to why this app needed negative feedback, other than \"i don't like it\".\n\nEh, you have no idea how much spam things I remove from this sub ;)\n\nI did not say it needed negative feedback, I only said it's not something I want from an application, so no thank you. Me telling the person that the reason I don't like it is because it's not for me is not being rude.\n\n> So either you are saying that you are allowed to offer negative comments that no one asked for,\n\neveryone is allowed to, I don't see what you're trying to say.\n\n>  but i am not allowed to call you out on it,\n\nYou would be if you would comment on what I said rather than what you made up in your head. Comment on the words I said without bringing in your imagination and there is no problem.\n\n>  or you are trying to argue that to you \"great feeling\" and \"stress\" are neutral terms\n\n??? again you're making things up, again, to make it clear, all I say on reddit is **personal opinon**\n\n> Quite frankly, both seem wrong to me.\n\nand again instead of arguing the case you're going into the safe environment of what something seems to you, or what you imagine, rather than actually looking at what was really said.", "created_utc": "1652190711.0", "edited": "False", "id": "i81u3co", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_um5sun", "parent_id": "t1_i81s1ws", "score": "1", "subreddit": "sudoku", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r2mp"}, {"author": "sotolf2", "body": "I knew you couldn't help yourself :p\n\n> No, that's not what is happening.

It means what I said, nothing more nothing less.\n\n> Solving through the logic and managing to solve the puzzles are the parts I find the most enjoyable about solving, others find solving in shorter time fun, or just playing with the numbers, I'm not going to tell others what they should find fun about a puzzle game they play with themselves.\n\nwhich I thought would be quite understandable, but enlighten me if you could what you don't understand about that.\n\n> I asked this, because to me it really seems like there is very little room to interpret it any other way.\n\nYou could have interpreted it the way it was written instead of an uncheritable version that you made up.\n\n> Using \"great feeling\" and \"stress\" instead of \"fun\" and \"not fun\" really does not change the meaning of it... It really, really doesn't.\n\nYou can make up stuff in your head as much as you want to, it doesn't change what I said.\n\n> Yet, you are blaming ME for misquoting and arguing.\n\nYou are the one changing my quote every time before you start commenting on it.\n\n> Your comment was, in my opinion, both rude and irrrelevant to OPs question. \n\nYou're free to have your opinion. I found it relevant, you might not, if you don't just ignore it and go on with your day :)\n\n> Therefore, in my opinion, it would have been better to not make the comment.\n\nYeah, I'm however not dictated by your opinion, as I'm not you.\n\n>  Also i wanted to give OP some encouriging words\n\nWhich you are free to do\n\n> Both because i can understand how harsh your comment might be for a developer and because i actually think it might be a fun way to play a short game.\n\nThey were advertising on our board, they will have to be ready to deal with critisism from people that love sudoku. I don't see the problem, sudoku applications are a dime a dozen, so many are just out after getting promotion. I could have just locked the post if I wanted to, for being spam, I didn't.\n\n> That is not an attack on you and if you interpret it as such, that's a you problem. And no, that doesn't make my argument invalid.\n\nYou misinterpreting and arguing an imagined version of what I said rather than what I did however is the whole reason this thread is so long.\n\n> Why are you allowed to have your opinion but i am not?\n\nYou are, your opinion of what you think I said however does not hold water when I'm literally here correcting you.\n\n>  You're the one who got defensive after that, i really don't know how you are reading this differently.\n\nI got defensive when you misrepresented what I said with quotes you imagined in your head rather than what I said.\n\n> Yet you are spending half a day convicing me it didn't. Amazing.\n\nI'm free to spend my day however I want to, and you're the one always reply to them, it takes two to tango buddy ;)\n\n> Honestly, at first i just assumed you made that first comment in a sh*tty mood and would realize that yeah, it was kind of lame when someone pointed it out.\n\nNo, what made me in a bad mood is your continous misrepresentations of what I said, also you're allowed to say shit, fuck cunt and whatever you want on reddit, no need to censor it when it's so clear what you thought.\n\n>  Unfortunately that doesn't seem to be the case.\n\nAgain you're arguing against something I never said, nor thought, so of course I don't agree with it.

It was an answer to a question that wasn't asked.\n\nNo you were saying that I told them it was \"a shit idea\" which I never did.\n\n> No, i know exactly what you said and i am done with explaining it to you.\n\nIt seems you can't really say that as you keep on telling me I have said things I haven't and you can't quote any of it it seems, there must be a reason for that.
