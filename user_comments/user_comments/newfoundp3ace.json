But these people usually laugh at these guys.  There is no real authority.. unless where you live, like the way you speak- it sounds like its a bit \u201cold fashioned\u201d.  That is a horrible situation. \n\nCan I reference something for you?\n\nMusic has helped me.  Im a medium sized regular American dude.  Nothing special.   Let me tell you, music motivates me through almost everything.  Its incredible when used correctly.  \n\nIt will not instantly fix anything. It can be especially empowering though. \n\nWomen who make music tend to speak to other women.  Its such a beautiful thing to me. Sometimes I wish I could understand it. I can\u2019t though, i do partake.  Sometimes an older women singing can carry a younger women through difficult times.  Idk\n\nThese are big big points for such a troubled mind. You clearly absorb everything around you intensely.  I can 100% understand why. And i know life is difficult.  But if you live for your own self, these people wont matter. You don\u2019t have to be with them romantically. Don\u2019t fall for that. The world is big.  These are young men. Time moves forward.   You are worthy of someone and something that understands you and knows how to elevate you and inspire you.  \n\nI hope you learn to value you for who you are. Just because you are smaller or frail doesn\u2019t mean you cant be a leader or be important or have a voice.", "created_utc": "1663518688.0", "edited": "1663519231.0", "id": "ioy0tzt", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_xhiqh7", "parent_id": "t3_xhiqh7", "score": "5", "subreddit": "aspergers", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rm6u"}, {"author": "newfoundp3ace", "body": "South Carolina and Virginia: \n\n\ud83d\ude36\u200d\ud83c\udf2b\ufe0f\ud83d\ude36\u200d\ud83c\udf2b\ufe0f\ud83d\ude36\u200d\ud83c\udf2b\ufe0f", "created_utc": "1663513155.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ioxmwye", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_xh1co5", "parent_id": "t3_xh1co5", "score": "1", "subreddit": "coolguides", "subreddit_id": "t5_310rm"}, {"author": "newfoundp3ace", "body": "Honestly, meirl.
