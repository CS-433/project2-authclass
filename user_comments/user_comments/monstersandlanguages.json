It's part of the online digital art community where people make characters called \"adoptables\". These characters can be anything from a few cents to multiple hundreds (or even low thousands) of dollars. They can be cute anime boys, dogs, dragons, or things called \"closed species\". It's just pixels. You almost never get anything you can touch with your hands.\n\n\nThe community is cliquey and the popular people tend to either be self-absorbed or unwilling to engage outside of their circle for a multitude of reasons. People can get unbelievably hostile if you own an adopt they want, or they think you own too many from a specific artist, etc.\n\n\nSome of the artists themselves can be very nice, but in the end they just want as much money as they can fleece out of you. Once that invoice clears? You might as well be invisible. They 100% do not care about you in any way, shape, or form as a human being.\n\n\nThe whiteknights for these artists tend to be insane. Very \"pick me!\" behavior. Many of them will ignore everything from scams to pedophilia.\n\n\nI'm not saying there aren't normal, friendly people in the community. What I *am* saying is they're drowned out by the people willing to throw hundreds to thousands of dollars for pixels from popular artists, as if that, by extension, makes them popular, too. They're drowned out by people who want to beat you down for having something they want, or for daring to speak out against the practices that have turned the community into a cesspit.\n\n\nIt started out as an okay community, but in the past two years it's become disgusting with how manipulative and destructive the artists tend to be (and some of the regular community members). You're so afraid to say anything that it's like being in an abusive relationship. \n\n\nPeople will spend large chunks of their paychecks for an adoptable that they often later have to resell, at a loss, or that they'll immediately trade for something else. Some of the worst artists come up with terrible stories about being kicked out, not being able to afford insulin, etc., in an attempt to get their work sold faster and for a higher price.\n\n\nShopping addiction is a very well known phenomenon in the entire community. Nobody likes to address it, because then it becomes, \"oh, so you don't want artists to make a living?!\" And then the whiteknights descend upon you with hammers.\n\n\nJust...not a great community, especially the \"closed species\" sub-community, where the prices are often the highest, the rules on what you can do with your purchases are often quite stringent, and regular community members range from normal to \"worships the ground the owner walks on\".\n\n\nNow that I'm out of it, I see it's a bizarre, toxic, and expensive community and hobby.

Dogs with a tendency toward dog aggression (which includes pitties, sorry) are a higher risk. It can take you by surprise, too, since your dog might love other small animals and just despise other dogs. That's not a failing on the dog's part. This is just what happens when you have an intelligent animal with a unique personality. As an owner, you always have to know your dog. It just happens to be even more important when you have a strong, willful, intelligent breed that can do a lot of damage.\n\n\nSmall dog owners need to be aware, too. Your little dog shouldn't be running up to a bigger dog without the owner's permission (the number of unleashed small dogs vs big dogs I see is incredible). If your little off-leash dog picks a fight with an unleashed dog, pittie or not, that's on you.
