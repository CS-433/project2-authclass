I chose German.\n\ntldr: All the reasons people say it was the \"wrong\" choice are correct, but it was still the right choice.\n\nThere are 2 things that make me say I made the right choice. But, first, the obvious reason I made the wrong choice.\n\nSpanish would have been way more useful. Not just in a practical sense, but, in my travels abroad, I frequently meet Spanish speakers, and I get along with them REALLY well. I call many of them close friends who I would like to be able to be closer with by speaking their language. I will get around to learning Spanish eventually.\n\nHowever, By learning the \"less useful\" language, I MADE opportunities to use it. I went out of my way to travel to Germany, experience the culture, and make friends. My experience was sort of the opposite of others, but it also made me realize that you literally can throw a dart at a map and find people there you like and part of a culture you find interesting.\n\nFinally, at the time I had to choose, German was what middle school me wanted to do. It was a smaller class that was more fun to be in and it felt like it had character. If I took Spanish, I would have been personally uninspired, surrounded by other similar people who were there because it was the \"easy\" choice, and I would have hated that class. I probably wouldn't have stuck with the language as much after high school and may not have discovered my love of languages and travel in General.\n\nI would bet that 10 years from now I will have better Spanish than I would have if I had taken it in High School.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs a similar aside, I eventually decided I wanted to learn a third language while still in high school. I narrowed it down to a few and started asking others for thoughts and advice on what to learn. Everyone recommended Chinese or Spanish, but I thought Russian was cool. Literally no-one thought it was a good idea that I learn Russian, but I realized I wasn't really asking for advice, but fishing for good reasons to learn Russian, because it's just what I wanted to do.

Thats because we're a group of people with just as diverse a set of tastes as preferences as everyone else.  In an ideal world, there would be just as many vegetarian and non vegetarian options.

Imagine how poorly your restaurant would be reviewed if you only served one dish.  That is a common experience for vegetarians.  You don't need to do them all, but aim for at least 2 so that we have some choice.\n\nQuick note that many things are \"pseudo vegetarian\" such as many Italian cheeses which contain renet, gelatin, and sauses marinated in but not directly containing meat.  Many vegetarians will eat this, but many won't.  Similar to the above point, we are all vegetarian for out own reasons and draw different lines in different places.  This can be hard to convey on a menu.  If you use vegetarian parmesan, say so.  Most people will assume you just don't know it's not vegetarian and avoid that dish.  But also don't be surprised if the vegetarian DOES order something with renet or gelatin in it.\n\nThe best approach by far is not to make the judgment for us.  Just have a small font under each dish saying what types of meat and other animal products or allergies are in them.  This automatically covers ALL vegetarians, vegans, allergies, and various religious diets.  It is less work for you and makes me feel much more comfortable eating there.\n\nFinally, thanks a ton for asking!  Be sure to advertise that you have veggie options too!

However, G is fully defined once we define F and A, so there are 8 DOF.  Finally, the whole thing can be moved up and down, rotated, or scaled, and it doesn't change the question, so that's 4 less, giving 4 total degrees of freedom.

I say this because UMN is used to students with parents who are bankrolling them and has a notoriously bad financial aid department that will often give incorrect information, doesn't properly understand the lives and perspectives of poor students, and often misses opportunities to make or save more money.  This is a big problem, and it's getting worse at UMN.\n\nFinally, onto the actual answer to your question:\n\nAll you do is accept it (always accept all of it) and go apply for a job on campus.  When they ask if you got work study funds, you check the box that says yes.  From your perspective, that is the only difference.\n\nWhat happens is that, if you have work study, the financial aid department pays a portion of your paycheck instead of whatever department you are working for.  Basically it's just a financial incentive for orgs on campus to hire you or pay you more, but you still just apply for jobs and get paid for your work like any other job.\n\nI personally accepted the work study funds every semester.  My first semester I didn't work at all, and my third semester I worked off campus full time, went to school part time, and worked on campus with so little hours I didn't even make my full work study.  I never had any issues come up with work study funds.\n\nOh, also you don't have to have taxes taken out of your paycheck!  You do still pay taxes when you do your taxes in April, which could end up being a lot since you weren't having any taxes taken out of your paycheck throughout the year, but realistically a campus job won't give you enough hours to make enough that you pay any taxes at all (less than the standard deduction).  If you get an off campus job, perhaps over the summer, then you may end up owing money in April and should consider about how much that would be in your budget.

That means they're used a LOT.  So, even if they do have one or two \"main\" readings, the less common ones will still come up a lot just because the kanji itself is used so much.  Also, with any language feature, the ones that are used the most are the most susceptible to change over time, variation, and exceptions.

This sounds very similar to your experience.  One ear will often get worse than the other for a number of reasons.\n\nI had fired many guns both with and without ear protection, and I also had pre-existing genetic and traumatic ear damage, but no permanent hearing loss until one specific day.\n\nI still remember one specific shot that made my ears ring way louder than normal and I could barely hear at all and it just never went away... that shot was a 22 magnum handgun, the second smallest gun I had ever shot, and we were outside.  This lasted a few days before going to a doctor and getting a test to determine that I was permanently deaf in one ear.  The other ear never even rang when I was shooting.\n\nIt's actually MORE important to wear protection with handguns.  The larger guns will absorb/utilize more of that energy that, with a handgun, goes into making more noise.  The size also changes the timbre of the sound, so it's less of a long and low \"boom\" and more of a high and fast \"crack\" that is better at doing damage to your ears.\n\nI now have other ear issues and occasionally see an ENT.

Some people call this failing too, although it's technically not.\n\nI noticed that what \"good\" and \"bad\" grades are was very different between America and Germany.  Really, this was just one part of many differences that come together.  It might be similar in Korea.\n\nThere are 2 differences that I think are important here: we pay for our college (and we pay a LOT), and our grades are based on homework, projects, attendance, AND an exam.  In Germany (and many other places), the entire class is effectively optional, and the final grade is all just one exam at the end.\n\nFailing a class in Germany was not a big deal.  You could sign up for the class next year, skip most of the class, show up to lectures for parts you struggled with last year, and then take the exam.  They are also very flexible with prerequisites, so you could take the \"next\" class at the same time.  You don't have to \"push back\" your classes.\n\nIn America, failing a single class CAN\\* have a massive domino effect that often results in losing tens of thousands of dollars, spending another year in college, and often dropping out.  You will have to pay to take that class again, and you will probably need to re-plan your next year since many of those classes can only be taken once you pass that class.\n\n\\*sometimes failing a class is not a big deal.  Some classes are \"general education\" and so totally unrelated to the rest of your studies.  Failing one of these doesn't matter as much since you can just take it again and it has no impact on the rest of your plan (although it does still take time and money).  Additionally, you often use a \"technical GPA\" which doesn't include these classes.  Failing a \"core class\" like algebra can really screw you up, though.  Also, some classes are known for being failed quite frequently, such as calculus 2, and so most people just make their initial plan to account for the fact that they might fail.\n\nSo, because failing a class can be so bad, most classes make it pretty hard to actually fail, but of course you don't want people who sort of SHOULD be failing to end up with degrees, which is why there are minimum GPA requirements and things.

However, with many puzzles, there are multiple little areas of that web that all LOOK very close to being solved but only one actually has the solved state in it.  When you end up in the wrong one, we call that parity.  As a rule, each one is equally likely, and it's basically impossible to tell which one you're moving towards until the end. \n\nIn order to solve this cube, you need to do a significant number of moves to jump to a whole different place on that web.\n\n\nAdditional note that may just confuse you:\n\nActually, this is the same phenomenon as pretty much every part of the solve.  Having the first side done looks close, but in order to get the rest of the way you need to temporarily mess it up to get to a state that is actually closer.\n\nParity is just a VERY extreme case because there are only 2 of these areas (actually 4) (compared to millions or more for the first layer).  That means it takes longer to realize you're in the wrong area and it takes more moves to get from one to another once you do.\n\n\nEdit: yes it's annoying, but I personally did solve this cube without looking up algorithms and was able to solve parity myself.

This isn't because none are \"good enough\", but because you need to be exposed and study in multiple contexts in order to learn well.\n\nPage for page, it's mostly Grammar, but that makes sense.  The same \"amount\" of grammar just takes a lot to explain well.  Vocab, which it has, is just a list of words, sometimes with pictures.\n\nI think the Grammar points do a good job at covering the \"core concepts\" that you'll need.  So, if you come to something that is confusing or you think Genki doesn't explain well, you can use the Internet as a resource to help, but you can feel pretty good that you aren't missing any big \"core concepts\" after getting through both.\n\nMost people just kinda recommend ignoring the Kanji in Genki.  There are a lot of other dedicated materials that teach them better, faster, and in a more sensible order.  That being said, it teaches them slowly, so you might as well learn them as they come up in Genki so you can read the passages.\n\nMy biggest complaint with the vocab is that it seems to just be selected based on the content of the chapter.  So, it's not necessarily ordered \"simplest to most complex\" and you may end up with some weird gaps in your vocab.  I recommend learning the vocab in Genki if for anything else so you can read and listen to the exercises, but keep your own vocab list as well.  This can even just be words you get from whatever Japanese media you consume.\n\nTBH I think all this makes sense.  It is relatively grammar centric, but that's also what makes it universal.  Every Japanese learner will need to learn the same Grammar in a similar order at a similar pace.  However, the vocab and Kanji you learn, and the order you learn them, is really best determined by the type of practice you'll be getting based on the media you consume.\n\ntldr:\n\nAll in all, I recommend it.

You could also live in New Hampshire a lot cheaper, but I'm sure you know that, and there's a reason you picked a place in North End.\n\nFor North End, that's probably still a bit steep, but not crazy.  But, it sounds like it would be a nice place, so it might be about expected.  700 square feet is pretty good for a 1 bed in Boston, but they're known to round and fudge numbers to get that higher.\n\nThe bigger issue, as others have mentioned, is trying to drive a car in North End.  There was some drama in this subreddit a while ago because someone wanted to bring a car to Fenway, people strongly recommended they don't do it, and then they posted a month later with a big rant about how terrible driving here is and apparently they moved away.  No one was very sympathetic because EVERYONE warned them.  Fenway is MUCH more drivable than North End.  It is probably one of the worst neighborhoods in the country to own a car.\n\nedit: seeing as you chose North End, I get the impression you want the \"city experience\".  For that, I might recommend Fenway or South End.  Both are still expensive, and both are unpleasant to drive in, but it's doable unlike North End or Back Bay.

People think more voting means more/better democracy, but not necessarily for a few reasons:\n\nThe whole point of a republic is that the average voter isn't expected to know a lot about every issue, so we pick people we agree with on the issues most important to us, and we hope that they tend to vote on all issues how we hypothetically would given the time and resources to be informed on all issues.\n\nWhen you open too many things to direct elections, you end up not only with \"dumb voters\", but also, the people who DO vote in those more specific elections often skew to one side.\n\nIn the specific case of the school board, parents probably have a lot more information about the school district, and are much more likely to vote in that election.  I don't have kids, and know very little about how schools are run here, but I DO care about having good schools that  are run in a way that matches my values.  By having them directly elected, they will skew towards the values of parents, and they can basically ignore the more common but individually weaker opinions of everyone else.\n\nCan I go through the effort of getting informed on public schools here?  yes.  However, you could say the same thing about EVERY issue, and you can't expect me to be well informed on every issue.  So, you need to have a specific reason why something is best decided directly by the public.\n\nThat brings me to the one big exception.  Constitutional amendments are rare, generally make big news, and are generally big changes as opposed to changing fine details, so you can expect a large portion of the population to be relatively well informed.  They change not only the government, but the way the government fundamentally works.  Since a constitution is a sort of contract between the government and the people, it makes sense that BOTH sides should need to approve any changes.\n\nYou could argue that the federal government doesn't directly govern the people but is just a contract between the federal government and the states, so the current system of state legislature approval is fine.  And many (most?) states and cities have referendums for constitution/charter amendments already.\n\nquick edit: there are things that are VERY popular with the people but unpopular with representatives (such as marijuana).

When the pandemic started, I was living in a new city with no friends, so started watching Anime to fill time.  That also meant I consistently had more time to dedicate to learning a \"harder\" language.  I wasn't particularly interested in Japan, but, spending so much time consuming Japanese media, it felt like a wasted opportunity, and now I want to travel there, too.\n\nI spent many years learning German for no good reason other than it was what my school offered, and it was a cooler group of people because it wasn't the \"easy choice\" of Spanish.  I continued learning after school and ended up studying abroad there and loved it, so I don't think you need to have a pre-existing passion to enjoy a country, people, or culture.  I just want to get some \"in depth\" experiences of a few other corners of the globe, and Japanese made sense to learn.\n\nAs for the \"after 20\" part.  Yes, it's easier to learn a language when you're younger.  But language learning is a hobby, and it's crazy to me that you would tell yourself you won't do something you enjoy for 80% of your life just because it would have been easier to do in the first 20%.  The important part of this logic is that I enjoy language learning itself, I don't just want to know a language or Japanese specifically.\n\nAs for thinking in the language, I think that's a thing you can train yourself to do from a pretty early level.  I know people who are VERY good at German, but obviously still translate in their heads, and people who think more in the language even if they don't know very much.  The important thing is, when you are learning, to consciously connect the words to the IDEAS, not to the English words.\n\nWhen you read \u5f7c\u306f\u96fb\u8eca\u306b\u4e57\u3063\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059, don't think \"he is riding the train\", but rather imagine a male person, and then a train, and then that person is in some way riding, and then you know they're riding it now.  That's not the same order you would \"build\" that imagine in your head hearing the English sentence.  This also helps a lot with comprehension since the grammar is so different.

Our cities were designed for cars, which allowed for and encouraged separated buildings further apart and further from the dense city center.\n\nA big benefit of living in an apartment is that usually means living in a denser area.  Because our cities are less dense and more car centric, there is less benefit to living in the dense city center.  In fact, living in the suburbs often comes with EASIER access to different places since that correlates with having space for a car and streets that are easier to navigate.  Our cities are less dense, have less public transit, and have less \"daily stores\" in the city centers, so living in the city center often means significantly limiting the places you have access to.  Basically the exact opposite is true in much of Europe.\n\nCulture also definitely plays a part in why people might prefer separated housing, but saying anything more than that is speculation on my part.\n\nAnother difference is that the buildings themselves are different.  Apartments here are often relatively quickly constructed out of different building materials than they may be in Europe and so sound is generally a bigger issue here.  We DO have apartments that have good soundproofing, but they aren't as common since that costs more and apartments are associated with cheaper living.  (before someone replies about dumb Americans not knowing how to build with stone)  So, in older East Coast cities, especially, nice apartments in dense city centers are more common, but still not nearly as much as Europe.\n\nYou'll notice a lot of these reasons are self-reinforcing.  You can't just start building high quality dense housing and expect it to work.  Similarly, you couldn't start building American style suburbs in Germany and expect it to work.", "created_utc": "1646620286.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hznl65z", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_t8dt2t", "parent_id": "t3_t8dt2t", "score": "7", "subreddit": "AskAnAmerican", "subreddit_id": "t5_2uah7"}, {"author": "musicianengineer", "body": "You know the pope has never been to the south side of Milwaukee?\n\nThat guy looks like him, but it aint Francis.", "created_utc": "1646608026.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hzmv2el", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_t88qpw", "parent_id": "t3_t88qpw", "score": "46", "subreddit": "softwaregore", "subreddit_id": "t5_2w2ea"}, {"author": "musicianengineer", "body": "I often provide support to customers for our (paid) software.

If you're doing a more language focused intensive program with more class hours it might be great, but probably not much more beneficial than classes in your home country.  You might have a better teacher and have much more class time though.  Being able to use what you're learning immediately in your life does help it stick and can make the class time more beneficial hour for hour.  But, it's still just a class.\n\nThe bigger benefit is just being surrounded by the language.  You'll learn lots of little things you wouldn't otherwise as they come up in real life.  There's no more discussing and guessing \"what's more important\" since you'll discover and learn exactly what you need to to live your life.

While all countries have flaws, if you fly this flag for it's original purpose, it is in support of a country that had, as a core principle, racism and slavery.\n\nHowever, the flag we currently know was not actually the confederate flag, but a modification of the confederate battle flag.  so, if you fly it in support of THAT original meaning, it's just blatantly treasonous, supporting a force that fought against the union.  It should be noted that America itself was born by an act of treason, so the point above (WHY they were fighting) is still important.\n\nHOWEVER, the flag we know now is a MODIFIED battle flag (rectangularified), which only became popular during Jim Crow and opposition to civil rights.  so, if you fly it for THAT original reason, then you are just supporting racism and opposition to civil rights.\n\nYou can argue that the \"technical\" meaning of a flag is less important than it's practical meaning.  Just like language, the dictionary doesn't define words, the way they're ACUTALLY used does (ie: the word \"literally\").  Well, the confederate flag is quite obviously used as an identifier of political identity that includes racism and opposition to civil rights.  Even if you do not support these, by flying this flag, you are identifying yourself as part of a group, that, as a core principle, does support these.\n\nFinally, it is portrayed simply as a flag of southern pride.  Are there some people who honestly fly this flag simply as an indicator of pride in their region?  Yes, probably.  While this is not, and never was, the explicit purpose of the flag, meanings can change as usage does.  However, purely anecdotally I would say this is a very small group.  The south still has the largest portion of black Americans, yet conspicuously everyone I've ever seen fly a confederate flag is white, many of whom are not even southerners.  While this doesn't mean there are no individuals who fly the flag and are not racist, this trend would not exist if it were only an indication of southern pride to most people flying it.\n\nThis last point means you can't assume EVERYONE flying it is racist or un-American, but there is definitely a trend between flying the confederate flag and being explicitly racist or supporting other racist and anti-civil rights policies.\n\nYou can claim that non-racist people can \"reclaim\" the meaning of the flag, but, as I've pointed out, there is no non-racist meaning to reclaim.  If people do want to start using the flag as an indicator of southern pride and nothing racist, that is possible, but that would be a NEW meaning being applied to the flag, not a reclamation of meaning.\n\nA lot of the critique of this flags use is over-simplified.  Claiming that it's the flag of a country we fought against or supported slavery also applies to the American flag from the perspective of the British, for example.  What it really comes down to is how the flag is realistically used.  When you speak, you do so to be heard, and when you fly a flag, you do so for it to be seen.

This is also a relatively common electoral system around the world.  This also used to be a very common way for states to elect their house representatives.  Most states did not elect ALL their seats this way, but rather some portion of their allotted representatives elected this way, while the rest were elected by relatively large districts.  This was eventually deemed unconstitutional as a slight majority can win 100% of the seats and this was used to limit minority voter impact.

However, that isn't really what happens.  The vehicles are programmed to be as safe as possible, which often means following the standard behavior that drivers expect from other drivers, even if that behavior is illegal (such as speeding and rolling stops).\n\nOf course, this is where government regulation can come in, essentially requiring the code to have certain parts so that it cannot break the law in specific ways, although this can actually result in less safe vehicles.  This is not to mention that we don't even really know what traffic patterns would look like if everyone followed every traffic law perfectly, because that's never happened.\n\nA good example is all the controversy that came out when they found out Telsas would sometimes \"prioritize the driver's life over pedestrians\".  These vehicles are always going to make some mistakes, and if you make a law that autonomous vehicles must prioritize pedestrians over the driver, then eventually a vehicle will kill its own driver needlessly.  Obviously, a vehicle could also accidentally needlessly kill a pedestrian, but putting hard regulations in either direction will result in more harm than if you just make them try and be \"as safe as possible\", whatever that may mean.\n\nPerhaps there is enforcement of laws on the results of the various company's self driving cars, but enforcing laws on the writing of the algorithms itself is likely to make it worse.\n\nLaws, until now, are all based on the results of actions.  No-one can look inside your head and see what you were thinking and put you in jail for thinking the wrong thing before you do it.

However, realistically, most people will \"scale\" their opinions of the candidates so that at least one candidate gets the min and one the max score.  So, if an irrelevant alternative is introduced that the voter likes more or less than all other candidates, it changes how they score the other candidates, pushing them closer together to make room on the scale for this new extreme.  You could argue that the intended way to score candidates is not to do this \"scaling\" and that is dishonest voting, so \"honest\" score ballot systems can meet IIA, but realistically that's not how people vote.\n\n2) There's no reason Approval would meet the majority criterion.  I think the confusing part is the second sentence.  Sometimes no candidate is approved by a majority, and sometimes multiple are.  The second sentence just means that the candidate who wins is approved by more voters that any other candidate.  \"the most\" means \"more than all other candidates\", not \"majority\".\n\n3) This means that a candidate preferred by a majority to any individual candidate is not necessarily preferred by a majority over \"anyone else\".  Consider that, of the majority that prefer \"anyone else\" they would disagree wildly on who that other person is.\n\n4) This one is more confusing.  Majority criterion looks at if a candidate is preferred most by a majority of voters.  However, since STAR uses score ballots, it can be ambiguous if such a candidate exists and who it is given only the ballots.  Giving the same score to 2 candidates doesn't tell which you prefer more.  Should this criterion consider the ballot only (ie, consider that the person honestly prefers them equally), or the actual opinion (consider that people DO have preferences between equally ranked candidates)?  Using the first thought process, that means a majority of people ranked the candidate highest and no other candidate equally.  They will win in any runoff and are a guaranteed Condorcet winner.

This could be a 4 year college or a technical college.) and then transfer to a \"better\" school.  You will save a lot of money and have the opportunity to prove yourself.  Once you have a college GPA, even for only 2 years, they don't care much about high school.

Most schools will teach at least one other, but that depends on the location and specific school.\n\nYou should know a bit about how High School in America works.  Everything here is just the norm or my experience, but not necessarily true everywhere.  Private schools and very small schools can be very different.\n\nCompared to other countries, American high schools give you much more variation and control in the classes you take.  You sign up for your own classes, and many of your classes will not be the same as everyone else in your grade.\n\nThere are usually 2 types of requirements: specific classes that you NEED in order to graduate, and subjects that you need a number of credits in, but no specific classes.  Foreign language usually falls into the latter category.\n\nWhat that means, is that you don't need to get to a certain level in Spanish in order to graduate, just take the minimum number of Spanish classes.  It's common to only need to take 2 years of a foreign language, and you can take them whenever you want within your 4 years.  Some people like the language, or it may count as other \"miscellaneous requirements\", and so they'll take foreign language all 4 years.\n\nWhat that means is that, if you know zero Spanish, they will just put you in the first Spanish class.  If you already know some Spanish, they'll put you in a higher Spanish class.  Both will allow you to graduate.\n\nAlso, if you are transferring schools, especially from another country, there will probably be lots of exceptions for you.

So, the only downside to not doing the foreign language is that, if you go to college, you may have to take foreign language then when other students already did.

I moved here from the Midwest, and similarly thought it looked like a scam, but Boston housing is really just that expensive.\n\nThe first 2 points only come into effect if you break the lease early or sublet.  lease breaking terms are often really bad such that, unless you break within the first half or so, it makes more sense to just keep the lease and pay for an apartment you don't need.\n\nThe key fee, first month, last month, security deposit, and broker fee are also all very common.  However, most places will charge some combination of those, but not all of them.  I have seen places that charge all before, though.  It's not a red flag, it just sucks.  My previous and current place both charged all of the fees you have mentioned except the last month rent, which I wouldn't be as concerned about.\n\nKeep in mind that the 2 months rent and security deposit aren't really extra, since that money is going to pay your rent or you'll likely get it back.  The broker fee is just parasitic, though.  If you stay there for 1 year, it effectively increases your rent by 8%.\n\nMoving from a different part of the country, putting up that amount of money can be very difficult.

While in showings, I've pointed out things that are wrong or I don't like and they get mad at me (fine, I won't rent it, then).\n\nWhen it comes to getting stuff fixed, I've rented from an individual and a company.  Both are very \"hands off\" but will fix shit when I ask pretty quickly.  They really just wanna not have to worry about anything while they sit back and collect my money.\n\nAll of this comes with one big asterisk: landlords in college areas can be, conversely, VERY predatory, both in terms of taking your money and not delivering good living conditions.

It sounds obvious when you say it, but winter gear is widely available in places where it's needed, especially in fall and winter.  Similarly, people will help you once you get there.  Hopefully, you'll realize it's not too hard as people have lived in cold climates for a long time, and we have developed the products, infrastructure, and habits to deal with it very well.

Don't be surprised when strangers help push your car out of a snow bank or give you their spare hat and gloves.\n\nA good coat is only one part of staying warm, and honestly, probably not the most important.  Hat, gloves, scarf, and, perhaps most importantly: boots.  Boots aren't just for walking in the snow.  Unlike the rest of your body, your feet are in constant contact with the freezing ground.  Boots provide necessary insulation between you and the ground as much as between you and the air and the wet water or snow.\n\nWe aren't tough.  We have the equipment to live in the cold without needing to be tough.  If you are cold or in pain, that doesn't mean you need to toughen up, it means you need more or better winter gear.\n\nAs for driving, I think most people overreact (asterisk, please keep reading).  I have only lived in places where a foot of snow is not uncommon, I've never driven 4WD or AWD, never had winter tires, and most people I know don't either.  Just drive slow.  It's always a good idea to have a shovel, salt, and some winter gear and/or a blanket in your car.

If you really want, I would suggest just using SPAV (in this case that means dividing the vote weight of winner votes by 2 instead of removing entirely.  Could be a different number depending on the proportionality method.) or dividing by whatever quotient would remove exactly some defined portion of the total ballots (1/3 for droop quota).  This way, extra votes for the first winner don't remove total vote weight in the runner up round.\n\nEven normal SPAV is not very good at being proportional, and it's REALLY bad when there are only 2 candidates.  The first candidate chosen is relatively centrist.  Assuming different political factions are relatively similar in size, the runner up winner will be whichever candidate has the least overlap with that centrist candidate.  This will produce one centrist candidate, and one, by definition, relatively fringe candidate.  (edit: imagine a linear political spectrum with candidates A B C D.  The top spot is realistically between B and C, and if B wins, D is practically guaranteed the runner up spot and same for C and A)\n\nFinally, using ANY proportional system as a primary is generally counterproductive.  The purpose of the primary is to select 2 candidates that have a good chance at winning in the general.  Any form of proportional representation will intentionally choose 2 candidates who differ a decent amount, leading to a non-competitive general election, often in which the eventual winner is obvious after the primary, even if there was another candidate very similar to the primary winner who may have had a good chance at beating them in a runoff.\n\nThe purpose of a primary is not to be proportional, it is to produce a shortlist of candidates who all have a good chance of winning in the general.\n\nI will say that I am not opposed to a very slightly semi-proportional system.  For example, instead of dividing the vote weight of the first winner by 2, multiply it by 0.9 or something similar.  The hope is that this is small enough to prevent the \"obvious general\" described above, but prevents candidates running with \"dummy clones\" to intentionally secure both top spots unless that pair has at least some very large portion of the vote, depending on the quotient used.", "created_utc": "1634084161.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hgf7w0c", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_q6yt6r", "parent_id": "t3_q6yt6r", "score": "6", "subreddit": "EndFPTP", "subreddit_id": "t5_3fo0j"}, {"author": "musicianengineer", "body": "I prefer\n\nyy MMM dd mm yyyy\n\n19 AUG 10 08 2019", "created_utc": "1634078201.0", "edited": "1634087710.0", "id": "hgeuxsh", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_q6v6g8", "parent_id": "t3_q6v6g8", "score": "2", "subreddit": "ProgrammerHumor", "subreddit_id": "t5_2tex6"}, {"author": "musicianengineer", "body": ">The average size of a finished 2x4 is 1.5x3.5 inches.\n\nThis makes it sound like the finished size varies, but the finished size is also standardized.\n\n1 inch is planed 1/4 inch short\n\n2-6 inches is planed 1/2 inch short\n\n8+ inches is planed 3/4 inch short\n\nA similar concept applies to the thickness of sheet lumber, but the numbers are different.", "created_utc": "1634064742.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hgdyfxb", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_q6labl", "parent_id": "t1_hgck5vl", "score": "27", "subreddit": "NoStupidQuestions", "subreddit_id": "t5_2w844"}, {"author": "musicianengineer", "body": "hey, here's a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Usrc_eCRO3I) about exactly this!

If you let it run free, it will create lots of speed and no torque.  If you hold it still, it will produce no speed, but lots of torque.  Both of those situations produce no power and is pretty useless, and there will be some place between those extremes that the waterwheel is most efficient.  Any way to have 2 waterwheels power the same thing will connect them in some way, so they won't run as if they weren't connected at all.  They WILL affect each other.  The question then is just what functionality you want.\n\nIf you tie them together with \"normal\" gears, they will spin at the same speed (\\* I'll get to this later) and their torque will be added, so the final \"output\" will have more torque than either produces alone.\n\nIf you tie them together with a differential, the opposite will happen.  Their speeds will be added together (\\* and divided by 2, but don't get hung up on that), but they will spin at whatever speed they need to to produce the same torque.  This can actually be a much bigger issue.  If one wheel has a lot of water pushing it, but the other wheel is not being pushed as much by the water, then that \"weaker\" wheel can actually spin backwards, and LOSE energy to the water.\n\nCombined with the fact that differentials aren't simple, that is realistically out of the picture.\n\nSo, back to \"normal\" gears.  Firstly, I doubt either waterwheel is \"losing\" power (this COULD happen, but isn't likely if both waterwheels are in water going similar speeds).  However, each wheel will have a different speed that it runs most efficiently at (described earlier).  because they are forced to run at the same speed, neither will be at max efficiency, but the overall power output is still likely higher than either alone.  What you can do, is use gears or pulleys to connect the 2 together so that they spin not at the exact same speed, but some ratio of each other.  That way, you can get a bit closer to each wheel running at it's most efficient speed.\n\nFor example, say waterwheel 1 is in water than is moving 5m/s and waterwheel 2 is in water moving at 3m/s (I have no idea if these are realistic numbers).  You may want the wheels to spin at about that ratio as well, so you can connect them with a set of gears or pullies with, for example, 15 and 25 teeth respectively.

You may only list in order of priority the options you favor.\n\nSo firstly, voting systems generally do not allow you to vote \"against\" candidates, including FPTP.  Perhaps they mean being able to vote such that \"I would rather anyone win than x\".  If you want to vote \"against\" a candidate in FPTP, this is done by voting for the candidate you think has the best chance of beating the candidate you don't like: not good.\n\nSecondly, you effectively CAN vote \"against\" an option with IRV (they are describing IRV, which is just one specific type of RCV) by ranking the other options above that one (or not ranking least favorite at all).  This way, no matter what the final match up is, your vote is going to the other option.  The only caveat that makes this not a true vote \"against\" is if the final matchup is between your least favorite and an option you didn't consider at all.  However, it's pretty easy to follow an election and know the shortlist of candidates expected to be in the final round: not perfect, but effectively a vote \"against\".\n\n>your ranking decision would be influenced by your conclusion about whether \\[your first or second choice\\] would fare better in a head-to-head against \\[your least favorite choice\\]\n\nThis is true.  Center squeeze is one specific situation where you see this phenomenon.  Again, this same situation arises in FPTP, but worse as you can't indicate the preference for both over your least favorite, only one.  We even see this now in primaries as a primary factor in primary votes is how likely they think each candidate is to win in the general, even if primary voters don't like them as much.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, given these strange requests, what voting system are they imagining?\n\n>It would be much simpler just to vote thumbs-down against our worst outcome.\n\nwhat the actual fuck are you serious?\n\nSo, they want a voting system in which you vote AGAINST candidates (not ranked), and based on the word \"worst\" they seem to want you to only vote against ONE candidate.  That's called [anti-plurality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-plurality_voting).  It's literally used as a meme as an example of an intentionally terrible system.\n\nNot only do you have all the joys of plurality voting (FPTP) due to only having one vote, but also, because there are no votes FOR, only votes AGAINST, a candidate that runs secretly and so gets no votes would win every election.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI found their [website](https://www.negative.vote/about/) and it seems they are arguing for a \"dual superlative vote\" (although I they don't actually explain this anywhere, I had to piece this together) in which you have one vote for your favorite candidate and one vote against your least favorite.  This is also terrible and doesn't fix the strategic voting associated with FPTP.  I can't believe this appears to have any actual following.\n\nAs a quick proof-of-ridiculousness,  imagine 2 parties each with a major candidate.  One party, however, also has some crazy fringe extremist candidate that not many people even know about.  Most people vote FOR their main candidate and AGAINST the other main candidate (lets say 49% each).  most people either don't know that fringe candidate or don't take them seriously.  Those fringe supporters vote for their fringe candidate and against the other parties main candidate (2%).  That crazy fringe candidate will win.  I shouldn't need to go into any further math about a system in which a candidate that was potentially a write in by 2% of the population can loose to 2 candidates with 49% support (not to mention actual centrists who would likely not gather many votes either for or against as they aren't many people's absolute favorite or least favorite, but are generally liked).", "created_utc": "1633291965.0", "edited": "1633292483.0", "id": "hf9mmzg", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_q0ly2n", "parent_id": "t3_q0ly2n", "score": "23", "subreddit": "RanktheVote", "subreddit_id": "t5_38wpz"}, {"author": "musicianengineer", "body": "Not putting a candidate on your ballot effectively ranks them last, but also ranks them as equal with every other candidate you don't rank.\n\nEither way, that isn't really voting \"against\" anyone, but I'm not even sure what they mean by that.", "created_utc": "1633289925.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hf9hgp2", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_q0ly2n", "parent_id": "t1_hf8wkyz", "score": "5", "subreddit": "RanktheVote", "subreddit_id": "t5_38wpz"}, {"author": "musicianengineer", "body": "I ship it", "created_utc": "1633288810.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hf9eluq", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_q0kbs9", "parent_id": "t3_q0kbs9", "score": "8", "subreddit": "youtubehaiku", "subreddit_id": "t5_2tqlz"}, {"author": "musicianengineer", "body": "I just realized, does this mean there is going to be an official Yagoo baseball card?\n\n(do they do baseball cards in Japan?)", "created_utc": "1633278827.0", "edited": "1633279011.0", "id": "hf8q4ni", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_q0febj", "parent_id": "t3_q0febj", "score": "9", "subreddit": "Hololive", "subreddit_id": "t5_29numb"}, {"author": "musicianengineer", "body": "\"If the Roman Empire used the Electoral College\" maps incoming.", "created_utc": "1633208342.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hf55kx4", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_pzujwr", "parent_id": "t3_pzujwr", "score": "3", "subreddit": "MapPorn", "subreddit_id": "t5_2si92"}, {"author": "musicianengineer", "body": "Bury it.

For the purposes of an Internship, being able to say you learned how to do X, use software X, or owned and completed project X is more meaningful that being a mathy secretary at a company with a big name.  I would say the only exception to this is if you already know you want to work there full time after graduation.  Even still, investigate first if having the internship will even help.  Some places hire frequently and have strong preference to previous interns, some places will just have you apply like everyone else and all but ignore that you had an internship there.\n\nWhen it comes to specific industry, no-one is expecting you to have defined your career perfectly prior to graduating, so you don't really need to find a job in that exact industry.

We frequently asked them for advice, opinions, and preferences while making our designs.  Many of them were more familiar with the nuances of getting the products working best, and they often had ideas to make their assembly process smoother.  We even involved some more experienced shop guys in some customer facing meetings for their input.\n\nSimilarly, Our relationship with management was good (albeit still not perfect).  Each department had their direct manager (a non-technical employee) stationed with their respective Engineering team directly off the shop floor as opposed to in the main office with the rest of the money people.  Even though they weren't Engineers, spending that much time with us and on the shop floor made them real advocates for us, not against us.\n\nBetween those two and other things, there was a much better feeling that all your interactions were run by respect as opposed to emotionless business.\n\nTo give one really good example of this:\n\nAbout 5 months in a very close family member died very suddenly, unexpectedly, and tragically.  I got a call at work, started crying, and was told to \"take all the time I need\".  No questions asked I took about 3 weeks off and after that sort of weened myself back into working, mostly half days and sometimes still just not showing up.  After about 5 weeks total I was back to working full time.

The factory was located pretty close to a large downtown, so I cant imagine the property was cheap and it didn't NEED to be there.  It's a damn shame really.\n\nI was just a co-op with a limited contract, so I don't know what's come of it since.

I studied in Hamburg, so YMMV depending on where you are, but this is based on my one experience in Hamburg.  It may or may not even be indicative of Hamburg as a whole as this is only one experience, so others can back me up if you want.\n\nI'll mostly back up what the other person has said.\n\nLearn German.  This one's a bit weird, because during most interactions in a big city most people will prefer to speak English because their English is probably better than your German.  However, when it comes to making friends, if you only speak English, you will always be a little \"external\" to the group of friends.  Knowing German allows you the potential to be a full deep, close, friend as opposed to a drinking buddy or \"pal\".  That's not necessarily bad depending on what you're looking for.\n\nCompared to America, Germans tend to take friendship more seriously.  They are also very honest.  Initially they may come off cold or even rude, but once they warm up to you and call you a friend, don't expect them to be flaky and don't be flaky in return.  For example, when you are getting to know someone, you may ask to see their place (especially in college, seeing each others dorm rooms is common in America) and they will just say \"no\".  It's fine, you're still friends (or, rather, becoming friends), they just aren't that close yet.  (Also, visiting someone elses home or especially bedroom isn't as common there in general)  I was only there for 6 months, but saw as multiple people opened up more over that time much slower than Americans generally would.\n\nPUT YOUR PHONE DOWN.  I mean this in 2 ways:  Don't expect to have much meaningful conversation or get to know anyone via texting.  They tend to use texting (whatsapp actually) just for practical communication and to set up times to meet in person.  Secondly, when in person, no-one had their phone out.  In my friend groups in America it was not uncommon to be casually hanging out and one or two of the people were texting or doing something of the sort.  That never really happened, and there was more of an expectation that you are always \"there\".", "created_utc": "1632039610.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hdfuqqh", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_pr2z9f", "parent_id": "t3_pr2z9f", "score": "57", "subreddit": "AskAGerman", "subreddit_id": "t5_2y3st"}, {"author": "musicianengineer", "body": "r/AncapWeebs is leaking", "created_utc": "1632026699.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hdfcwgt", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_pqjvxm", "parent_id": "t3_pqjvxm", "score": "0", "subreddit": "Hololive", "subreddit_id": "t5_29numb"}, {"author": "musicianengineer", "body": "am metalhead.\n\nis one of the most left leaning non-political communities you could possibly be a part of.", "created_utc": "1632026378.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hdfccww", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_pqr4if", "parent_id": "t3_pqr4if", "score": "11", "subreddit": "PoliticalCompassMemes", "subreddit_id": "t5_3ipa1"}, {"author": "musicianengineer", "body": "You aren't going to find a single English phrase that maps perfectly on to either one.\n\ntldr:\n\n\u3088 is for when you want to emphasize that you are providing new information.\n\n\u306d is for when you want to emphasize that you are saying something that is shared knowledge or you are looking for agreement.\n\nhttps://www.tofugu.com/japanese/yo-vs-ne/\n\nEspecially with Japanese, get used to \"translating\" into concepts, not English.", "created_utc": "1632019800.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hdez33k", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_pqs31l", "parent_id": "t3_pqs31l", "score": "15", "subreddit": "duolingo", "subreddit_id": "t5_2t6ze"}, {"author": "musicianengineer", "body": "Maple Syrup is stereotypically associated with Canada, but culture, and food, don't change immediately when crossing a straight line drawn on a map.\n\nIn many of the northern states getting real, local maple syrup is very much a thing.\n\nWhat bothers me is flavoring the syrup.
