Thank you so much for this incredible opportunity. I\u2019m currently running on a few hours of sleep so apologies if I make any mistakes aha. \nCurrently this game is on with the steam Christmas sale, which will be ending soon. \n\nThe game I would like to request is Ancestors: The humankind Odyssey. It\u2019s an incredible game about surviving and building up your clan in an open world jungle as apes, while finding out secrets which have shaped humans today. Like, hitting a coconut with a rock to break it open, using a stick as a weapon ETC. You can freely climb trees, hang from branches. Its so beautiful and has been on my wishlist for a while, I\u2019m super interested in the fact that the next steps don\u2019t stand out to you straight away, you really have to dig to find out what you\u2019re meant to be doing, with little guidance. It\u2019s very similar to other survival games I\u2019ve played, particularly subnautica. Which by far stands as my favourite game. \nAgain, thank you so much for doing this. Congratulations to everyone who has gotten something so far! Have a lovely day/night. \n\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/app/536270/Ancestors_The_Humankind_Odyssey/\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198366897781", "created_utc": "1609600983.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ghtzabb", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_koes35", "parent_id": "t3_koes35", "score": "1", "subreddit": "GiftofGames", "subreddit_id": "t5_2tb4r"}, {"author": "GEnderDragon", "body": "r/Sims3 due to the amount of hilarious memes which still arise from a very old community", "created_utc": "1608950068.0", "edited": "False", "id": "gh1g2y5", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_kkau84", "parent_id": "t3_kkau84", "score": "2", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i"}, {"author": "GEnderDragon", "body": "Edit: Not entering\nGood luck you guys!
