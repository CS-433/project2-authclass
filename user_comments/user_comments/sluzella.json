It'd go up from there based on the weather. \n2. Plenty of food! A good rule of thumb is to consume 150-250 calories per hour. This will keep you consistently fueled.\n3. A rain layer, such as a rain jacket.\n4. A map. Preferably physical, but if you do download it on your phone ALSO bring a power source to keep your phone charged.\n5. Light. Either a headlamp or flashlight with a strong beam.\n6. Extra socks. Switch out if your feet get wet. I usually switch my socks halfway through my hike regardless.\n7. Sun protection.

The advantages are extra balance, assistance, and having a \"fall back\" leg. \n\nThe remaining leg takes on a ton of stress, especially when it's a back one (which is what her dog has, one back leg remaining). They need to give her a ton of soft spots to lie down otherwise her stump gets sore and rubbed raw. She can only do short walks because her remaining back leg gets tuckered and sore faster and will start to tremble. She's not allowed to jump or do stairs to avoid any added stress on the remaining back leg. They have to be ultra careful about paw/leg health because if she gets injured, she would need to be fully crate bound while any injury healed. They can't let her play with other dogs because the stress of a play session on her remaining back leg is too much. Her dog is 7/8 years old and she says as her dog has aged they've had to be more and more careful. When she was young, they didn't have to take as many precautions (ie., their dog used to be allowed to go up short flights of 3-5 stairs or to hop up on the couch. Now, she has to be picked up/carried). They actually moved out of their condo into a ranch-style home to make things easier. \n\nDagwoods leg really seems to be bothering him. Any advantage in keeping it seems to be out the window at this point. He almost never seems to use it now and when he does, he does so very gingerly. I agree with people saying he seems like the life has been sucked out of him. I feel like he's aged YEARS in a matter of 6 months or so, which SURPRISE, is around when Birdie came into the mix and he is being constantly bothered/played with. Bri says she's all about her dogs, but she's actually 100% unwilling to change her lifestyle to accommodate a special needs dog. We've seen her continue to run Dagwood hard on trails while hiking and biking and he's constantly needing to use steep, narrow, stairs to access the trailer.

We live in a 60+ year old apartment complex, so noise is expected.  Hearing every step he takes we knew would happen and we got used to it.  But, he keeps a very odd schedule and is just not considerate at all.  On more than one occasion we have had to go speak with him about noise only to find him rearranging his living room or putting furniture together at 1am or 2am.  He plays video games until late and screams and yells.  We've spoken to him at least 1-2x a month since we moved in almost a year ago.  We get woken up between 1am and 3am 2-3 times a week. He walks around with shoes on at all hours which makes the noise worse.  He is supposed to have 75% of every room covered with carpet and a runner in the hallway, but he doesn't and management will not enforce it for some reason.\n\nWell, since WFH, it's gotten worse. Discovered he loves to blast music and scream sing along to it for most of the day.  So loud I can hear every single word and our apartment vibrates with the bass and my coworkers on Zoom calls can hear it. I have to speak to him almost every single day.  He's apparently a shit cook and sets the fire alarm off at least once a week.  He still has multiple friends over every Friday and Saturday (as I type this, he has at least four people over).  He's started getting almost retaliatory. If we ask him to quiet down at night, he will, but not before stomping/jumping around his entire apartment for 5-10 minutes.  If I ask him to turn down his music during the day, he will.  For maybe an hour. Then he'll blast it even louder.\n\nIt's rage inducing.  We've sent countless videos to management asking them to enforce the carpeting rule *at least* and they straight up tell us they do not get involved in \"neighborly disputes\".  My partner and I  moved here specifically as it is cheap and we planned on living here for 1.5-2 years to save for a house. Don't look like that's happening lol the stress from the noise and constant interruptions to sleep is actually taking a toll on our health at this point. /rant", "created_utc": "1587871340.0", "edited": "False", "id": "folvbf6", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_g7zckg", "parent_id": "t3_g7zckg", "score": "8", "subreddit": "MoneyDiariesACTIVE", "subreddit_id": "t5_12n5pd"}, {"author": "sluzella", "body": "This is what I was going to say.

If not, it would be a good idea to look at an older cat (at least a year old) who is more mature and can be left alone for longer periods of time.  Older cats also have more developed personalities and the shelter/foster home will be able to tell you if they are a good candidate for solo living.\n\nLitter - Start out using whatever litter the shelter uses and then you can figure out your own preference.  We use [paper pellet litter](https://www.chewy.com/yesterdays-news-original-formula-cat/dp/42185) which I love. Hides odors well, no dust, doesn't track, easy to clean.  There's so many out there though so shop around! Litterbox wise, up to you, but *do not* get a top entry one.  They're finding it's too stressful on their joints and many vets advise against them! Also, if you get a [closed/covered box](https://www.chewy.com/booda-dome-cleanstep-litter-box-pearl/dp/53590), they need to be cleaned more often and you need to be more careful about the dustiness of your litter.\n\nFood - Again, start out with whatever they are being fed at their shelter/foster home and then transition to your preference. Cats should ***always*** get wet food in their diet.  Offering wet food a minimum of 2x per day will help keep your cat hydrated.  The best wet food is one you can feed daily, so just get the best quality you can afford. If you choose to still feed dry food, go for a [high](https://www.chewy.com/tiki-cat-born-carnivore-chicken-luau/dp/172036) [quality](https://www.chewy.com/simply-nourish-source-rabbit-chicken/dp/199431) one that has a protein content of \\~40%! Either way, I don't worry about grain-free or not, I just look for a high protein content and that the first 2-3 ingredients are meat, but do your own research on this one. Everyone has a different preference. Side note: Kittens must be fed kitten specific food until they are a year old.\n\nWater - Keeping a cat hydrated is imperative for their long term health, so you want to make drinking water as easy and appealing for them as possible.  Most cats prefer moving water so investing in a [water fountain](https://www.chewy.com/catit-flower-pet-fountain/dp/178052) is a good idea.  If  you have a larger home, placing a fountain on each level would be ideal if you can swing it! Another trick is placing water *away* from where they are fed, in a different room would be best.\n\nPlay time - Invest in a [variety](https://www.thecatconnection.com/cat/kitty-boinks-bamboozler.html) [of](https://www.chewy.com/cat-dancer-cat-charmer-toy/dp/49379) [wand](https://www.chewy.com/pet-fit-life-2-feather-wand-cat-toy/dp/136702) [toys](https://www.chewy.com/jw-pet-cataction-ball-wand-cat-toy/dp/101665), [soft](https://www.chewy.com/frisco-plush-mouse-cat-toy-3-count/dp/187983) [toys](https://www.chewy.com/ethical-pet-mylar-balls-cat-toys-15/dp/215540), and a [cat safe laser](https://www.chewy.com/ethical-pet-laser-exerciser-original/dp/56335).  Engage your cat in interactive playtime throughout the day, at least 3-5 times per day, totalling 20-40 minutes depending on the age of the cat (for kittens, you're looking more at 60-90minutes a day, really as much as you can handle).  Play time allows cats to work physically, but also mentally.  It's imperative for keeping them in shape and keeping unwanted behaviors at bay.  Keep wand toys up and out of sight so they don't get desensitized to them! It's a good idea to also offer a variety of soft toys around the house and rotate them every few weeks (put some away in a closet, every once in a while, move some that are out to the closet, and some that are in the closet out).  Another thing you can do is provide a [puzzle](https://www.chewy.com/trixie-brain-mover-interactive-cat/dp/146125) [toy](https://www.chewy.com/pet-zone-iq-treat-ball-dog-toy-4-in/dp/142885) a few times a week for them to work their mind.\n\nScratching - Offer a variety of scratching posts throughout the home.  Flat ones, posts, leaning ones, cardboard, sisal, carpet (make sure it's a different type of carpet than on your floors), etc.  As you get to know the cat, they'll start showing a preference (my cat only likes [sisal rope posts](https://www.chewy.com/aspca-cat-tree-scratching-post-gray/dp/147693)), but at the beginning you want to allow them to develop that and set them up for success.\n\nCat Space - Get a tall cat tree early on.  Cats love to climb!  The more you can fit, the better. We have a small 1-bedroom apartment, but we have three cat trees - [two tall ones](https://www.chewy.com/frisco-68-in-faux-fur-cat-tree-condo/dp/129318) in the living room and bedroom and [one smaller one](https://www.amazon.com/AmazonBasics-Cat-Tree-Scratching-Posts/dp/B017WXWZ6Y/ref=sr_1_10?keywords=cat%2Btree&qid=1582205820&sr=8-10&th=1) in the dining room.\n\nTraining - It's all about redirecting and reinforcing.  If you see them chewing on a wire, give them a toy to chew on and reward them for chewing that instead.  If you see them scratching on furniture, pick them up and move them to a scratching item and encourage them to scratch there instead.  If you see them performing a \"good\" behavior, ie scratching on a proper scratching item, reward them with a small treat or a lot of pets!  Keep in mind, sometimes just removing the temptation is easier - like wrapping cords in double sided tape and taking items off high shelves.\n\nHealth - Have an idea of what vet you will use before bringing a cat home.  Find a cat specific vet or at least one that has a lot of experience with cats.  Make sure you keep up on rabies vaccinations, and flea/tick treatment once your cat is old enough.  Even strictly indoor cats can pick up fleas, so you want to prevent that. I recommend pet insurance as well, but do your own research on it!\n\nedit 1: Thank you so much for the gold!!\n\nedit 2: Added more detail and provided links for the products I use.  these are not the be-all-end-all products, so definitely shop around!

I had been lifting for two years consistently, but that second year is when I dialed in my diet and a lot of those changes became super visible.  I lost 30lbs of fat and gained more muscle.  I had those defined shoulders and bigger back/glutes/quads that made my waist look super tiny. I was curvy and filled out clothes really well. And I wasn't huge by any means. I'm 5'6\", weighed 140ish, wore S/M shirts and was a size 4/6 in jeans.\n\nWhen I went home for the summer, all summer, I got comments like \"You may want to lay off the weights\" and \"You're starting to get a little too bulky\" and \"If you keep lifting like that, by next summer you'll be way too manly.\"  These comments were *only* from women.  It really drove home to me that for many women any visible muscle/muscle definition = bulky. \n\nI like to get away from the \"You won't get bulky!\" and go, sure you're going to build muscle, but so what?

Two of the leggings were just...not good. They had no compression and the \"black\" was more of a dark green/gray.  The third pair was so tight I could barely get them on, let alone move comfortably in them.  The shirts were all supposed to be relaxed/loose fitting, but were skin tight,  I would've had to order 2-3 sizes up to actually get a loose/relaxed fit.

A quick daily romp with a wand toy or laser is usually not enough to keep them stimulated long term and a lot of \"annoying\" cat behaviors (walking around meowing, knocking stuff off of shelves, etc.) can be the result of just a bored cat.  If you live in a smaller space, like an apartment, you need to dedicate that much more time to enrichment.\n\nGet several different wand toys and play with your cat a ton, 20-40mins per day broken up into 3 or 4 play sessions.  Always store wand toys away and out of sight so your kitty doesn't get desensitized by constantly seeing them.  My cat has 6 different wand toys and we rotate which one we use so she doesn't become too accustomed to one. Six is probably overkill, but 2-3 would be great!\n\nGet a puzzle toy and fill that up once a day or so to work their mind a bit.  A treat ball or a puzzle mat are both excellent! You can use kibble or treats in them, just make sure it's worked into their overall calories.\n\nIf you have small toys out, rotate them.  So, leave half out and put half in a closet.  Every week, take away 2-3 that are out and replace them with 2-3 that have been \"in storage\".  You'd be surprised how crazy they go over toys they haven't seen in a bit!\n\nCats can even be clicker trained and learn tricks! That is a ton of fun and great way for the two of you to bond.
