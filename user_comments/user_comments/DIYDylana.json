In music everyone experiments a little to make new things. You get a genre, then people take that in a certain direction, it gets a following, a new sound is born and around it come new scenes, subcultures movements and waves and as soon as that happens it becomes a subgenre. But sometimes this transition doesn't happen too cleanly, there's this point where people go ''Eehm, does this even count as X genre? Its sort of that but also really new'' They don't quite know where to put it.\n\nThis is where terms like ''Alternative'' come in, alternative kinda goes against the expected conventions but not so far that it's core identity is brought into question, nor so far that it gets into ''experimental/avant-garde'' territory. In between are the genres with the ''art'' prefix, like ''art-rock''. ''Post'' then emphasises the idea of experimenting with the core identity of the genre as well as separating itself from the punk subculture while keeping its musical ethos, and thus going beyond the genre, while still having an important connection to that genre. It acts as a transitionary period of different music made from the same template that may or may not actually sound enough like the original genre. But it doesn't quite sound like a new genre yet. Post tends to happen when something is hard to give a name or define, or to emphasize the genres relation to a particular era or movement that came before it.\n\nPost-punk came from ''art punk''. You had amateurish DIY, Minimalist bands inspird by garage rock like the Velvet Underground. some sounded more like what we now see as punk, others sounded more like a punky version of the art rock, experimental rock and prog prior, focusing on the more experimental elements in garage rock. This would develop into more, and punk bands would also start branching out doing something new and different but kinda taking punk as a base, and boom, we got post-punk. It sits there as a transition between its sub genres gothic rock, jangle pop, etc, and then spawned the offshoot alternative rock, which gave us indie rock.  The noisier and harshsher side of post-punk was called noise rock, though it's also been used for other unrelated styles of bands.\n\nPost-Hardcore then was a mix of post-punk and post-hardcore. Until just like with the art punk thing, there were hardcore bands kinda branching out from the limitations of hardcore and their scenes, or simply not being accepted by hardcore scenes (emocore was basically considered too dramatic and whiny at the time for hardcore standards). They did things that fundementally went against the ideas of what makes hardcore hardcore, because hardcore can be pretty limiting. They wanted to make new stuff, but did so with a similar approach, philosophy and energy. So we got post-hardcore. Until eventually there was a wave of more polished, melodic and metallic post-hardcore bands. Then a bunch of bands spawned that were influenced by those and pushed those elements, but not the old ones. This got popular in the ''scene kid'' subculture, and so it quickly mixed with other genres they were into like scene versions of melodic metalcore, emo pop and pop punk. At that point ''Modern post-hardcore'' kind of separated itself from the old, in a sense, it's almost ''post-post-hardcore'', but the thing is they're probably the only group of bands consistently called, and consistently calling themselves post-hardcore. The older bands tended to identify more with other genres they were a part of, like Punk, Hardcore, Emo, Noise Rock, Post-Punk and Indie.\n\nPost-Rock appearantly was all about emphasizing texture/timbre over anything else and producing all these new kinds of sounds (I mean literal sounds not the overall sound of the band), but with the influence of things like post-hardcore, midwest emo and math rock, for some bands this actually ended up being more about more ''atmospheric'' rock. I recently found out a band like the Mercury Program was directly inspired by DC Post-Hardcore and punk, and I already knew Mogwai was inspired by slint, which explains why these types of post-rock bands don't really fit the original intention of the genre.\n\nPost-Metal and Atmospheric Sludge Metal thank their origins to forms of hardcore/post-hardcore and post-rock rather than just metal. So sometimes post-genres are called that simply because they're mixes of a post genre and something else. But post has been used in other ways too, like denoting a band being ''post'' or ''pre'' another band, typically when they do so the band will have some resemblance to the older band, so it's not often used when the new band is a completely different genre umbrella.", "created_utc": "1666527078.0", "edited": "1666527313.0", "id": "itg5md9", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_y24xrj", "parent_id": "t3_y24xrj", "score": "1", "subreddit": "PostHardcore", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s2pv"}, {"author": "DIYDylana", "body": "I think post-metal was more like a mix of post-rock and metal, similar to how post-hardcore started as a mix of post-punk and hardcore but then morphed into its own thing.", "created_utc": "1666525907.0", "edited": "False", "id": "itg3rfd", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_y24xrj", "parent_id": "t1_is3fulq", "score": "1", "subreddit": "PostHardcore", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s2pv"}, {"author": "DIYDylana", "body": "For refused try \"JR Ewing\".

There's so many interpretations. I assume we're talking about sex characteristics not social gender or identity here.\n\nI'm pretty sure there's cis people who mistakenly believe that they want to be or are a woman/man or trans, and i'm pretty sure there's cis people who genuinely question their gender identity, the latter of which goes against what mainstream subs would generally tell you.  But typically when cis people say they want to be x or wish they were x gender, they aren't talking about intrinsically feeling like or wanting to be that gender.  Instead they envy something practical they associate with that gender, or because they feel some kind of insecurity surrounding who they are themselves. It's not inherent to the gender, it's something extrinsic they want to get out of it. \n\nSo for example, a woman may have dealt with so much misoginy, they wished they were a man. A man may have been so ignored, they wished they got the attention some women get. A man may be the polar opposite to toxic masculinity and feel bad about it, or want to wear dresses or something and think ''if I was a girl this would just be so much easier''. I've seen some bisexual people who wanted to experience what it's like to temporarily have sex in the opposite type of body, or temporarily switch genitals. The list goes on.\n\nThis isn't really the same ''be'' that trans people talk about because for trans people it's just an intrinsic state of being. There is no ulterior motive there, the entire motive is to just be yourself.\n\nThen you can talk about fleeting feelings. Lotsa cis people seem to think ''I wonder what it would be like to be a woman'' but that's not like some kind of constant thing and it's kind of just a fun thought experiment, not core to who they are. Things like acting or personas or whatever are also temporary and not really a core representation.\n\nThere's also some different nuances when it comes to being itself. So, you could want to be the opposite sex because some part of your subconcious sort of already is or expects you to be, with ''want to be'' it means ''I want the rest of my body to match up and I want people to recognize that'', or if they don't really feel like it already at least they have something inside them that tells them they want to start feeling like the opposite sex or else something just feels off. So either you have someone who already feels like X, or someone who doesn't but just can't properly feel like themselves if they don't start feeling like X, and both of them want the different body. If you'd ask either of these people if they'd take meds that would make their dysphoria go away and be okay with their agab, they often say they don't want it because they feel like they'd be a different person at that point, instead they tend to say they just want to be the opposite sex. So something in their essense already kind of is the ''opposite sex'', or is at least kind of ''meant to be'' that opposite sex. It's all about rectifying their current sense of self.\n\nThis is different from more cis people who could potentially think ''I wish I was born a woman/man'' or ''I wish I was a woman/man in the next life'' because they simply want to know what it's like or whatever. They're totally okay with their current essence, there is no mismatch nor anything to rectify, they are simply curious as to what it would be like, just like someone might wonder what it would be like to be a cat, they're kinda talking about a sort of second or transformed life/self, not modifying the current self to be accurate to the subconcious. Even though if you'd import their mind into that of a cat forever they'd probably feel off as they'd feel like a human mind inside of a cat, if they truly became a cat, they wouldn't feel that way, so it's more about the idea of being a cat entirely being interesting, OR temporarily being a cat with a human mind. That's just a sort of metaphor, I'm not saying it's equivalent to wanting to be an animal, because our bodies actually seem to be aware of sex.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\------\n\nExtra food for thought:\n\nConsidering i've seen some people who wouldn't dare think of being the opposite sex, yet others who seem apathetic about the idea of having a body of the other sex and represent themselves as the opposite sex when they have the chance in stuff like VR or MMOs on a long term level without it just being some kind of persona or reversal, I imagine that if we lived in some kind of transhuman future, there might be people we'd now classify as ''cis'' (asin comfortable with their birth gender) who wouldn't mind switching between male and female bodies, or would even end up preffering the opposite for whatever reason. If this assumption is true, then that means that there would exist ''sex apathetic'' people who are comfortable with either as they see it as just a body. Cis people don't really tend to be all that bothered by sex and gender though they already feel comfortable so they generally come accross as ''apathetic'' but I'm willing to bet most would get dysphoric if they were suddenly the opposite sex or had such characteristics. It's interesting to keep in mind as a possibility though. These people would want to be transformed into the opposite sex, but again, that's not really the same concept as what most trans people are going through.\n\nI could also imagine that the identities may not always match up with the desired sex characteristics. Maybe some actually don't mind their characteristics being in between, maybe some would want to have the body of another yet still be seen as a man, I don't know, this is all a hypothetical future where we can pick whatever body we want so anything could go lmao.", "created_utc": "1666292234.0", "edited": "1666304471.0", "id": "it3tifc", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_y91w1i", "parent_id": "t3_y91w1i", "score": "11", "subreddit": "honesttransgender", "subreddit_id": "t5_11h46y"}, {"author": "DIYDylana", "body": "Prioritizing story over gameplay is like prioritizing lyrics (not vocals, lyrics) over the actual music in music.

It seems like there's different degrees for people as to how much they directly attribute something feeling wrong to their gender and how much they conciously identify with their actual gender before realizing they are trans. I imagine growing up in a society that tells you that you must be your agab if you're on the lower end of that spectrum will alter your self perception. If you think your agab is all you can be and all people will see you as then even if it's not something preffered it might not bother you too much in a direct sense. You'll feel like somethings wrong but you won't know what, so you can't really directly react to it, and if there's anything you're repressing It's less likely for you to figure it out.\n\nBut when you realize you're trans you may start to connect whatever negative feelings you had to your gender, or otherwise you might notice just how good/natural you feel when you're treated as and feel like your actual gender, and your self perception changes to something more accurate to who you are inside but also who you want to be. You might start putting in effort to be seen as the gender you really are which you never had put in before. Suddenly it sticks out like a sore thumb and everytime you are misgendered is a reminder of what you're not seen as or look like, and that your attempts weren't successful. Suddenly you also know what you might need to get through if you were to medically and socially transition. \n\n\n\n Okay so I'm a hobbyist pop punk singer. Let me try this hypothetical. Imagine you're not, but you kinda want to have a singing career but aren't sure yet (and you kinda feel bad in general but you haven't really connected that to your lack of singing skills) but you know you need practice to get there. And so whenever you do sing, it's bad, but you know it's bad and have the expectation for it to be bad and you haven't really tried working on it or putting in any effort yet, so it doesn't really bother you that much. You weren't serious anyways, hell maybe you even tried singing worse on purpose for comedic effect.\n\nLet's say you finally start trying properly, and you're kinda making progress, and have decided you really want to become a singer. But oh no, you botch it completely and everyone says you're terrible and should quit your career. Suddenly it hurts more doesn't it? You were genuinely trying, worked on getting that career, and this was who you wanted to be? Now imagine being told that it turns out thst you have a medical condition which will make it way harder to sound the way you want to than for other singers which you could have easily sounded like had you not had the medical condition. I bet that it would suddenly be a lot more frustrating than back at the start where the expectation wasn't there. \n\nI'm not saying these hypotheticals are at all similar, I'm just trying to convey that sometimes something may bother you a lot more when you figure out certain information and connections you didn't know before.

I call them ''transitional post-hardcore''.\n\nAt the Drive in, Thrice (has metal elements), Bear vs. Shark, Refused, Thursday, Finch, Glassjaw (has metal elements), Deftones (probably had the most metal), Saosin (related to earlier more old sound Audience of One), The Blood Brothers (came from sasscore), Fall of Troy (came from sasscore), BoysetsFire, MeWithout You, Brand New as well as the UK style bands like Million Dead, Reuben, YourCodename Is Milo, Hundred Heroes, Hell is for Heroes and Biffy Clyro.\n\n2: The more commercialized polished direction emo pop and pop punk (they were blending together at this point) were going in, Starting with bands like the promise ring, get up kids and Jimmy Eat World, Taking Back Sunday, Saves the Day, Fall-Out Boy and My Chemical Romance.\n\n3: Various more melodic metalcore bands like Poison the Well and Eighteen Visions. Rather than the sound being based on traditional hardcore punk, most of this post-hardcore is actually based on melodic metalcore.\n\nIt started out with a bunch of bands influenced by these bands, but eventually there were bands influenced by those who didn't really know of the connection. There's some band members that were very much involved with the older style of post-hardcore though, such as the aforementioned Saosin/Circa Survive and Senses Fail.\n\nThe ''scene kid'' look was partially popularized by the frontmen of Fallout boy and My Chemical Romance, and can be traced back to metalcore bands like eighteen visions and certain sasscore and screamo bands like Orchid and Swing Kids. A lot of the bands popular among them were on myspace, and it shared a space with more scene versions of pop punk/emo pop, melodic hardcore, ''white belt'' mathcore/grind/sasscore, and metalcore/deathcore. Many bands were popular on myspace.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe older style of post-hardcore, which is instead more connected to genres like hardcore punk, old style melodic hardcore, post-punk/art-punk, noise rock,  alternative metal, indie rock, alternative rock, post-rock and slowcore, still exists, it's just barely ever talked about and underground. Most of them sound more indie rather than post-punk like at the start, either that or they're more noise rock, or more ''emo''. There have been some more mainstream or successful bands that have had elements of post-hardcore without being of that more modern melodic style.\n\nSome modern examples of post-hardcore include: Greys (which are now more post-punk, so look for their older stuff), Big Ups, Plaids, Bars of Gold (post Bear vs. Shark), Jetplane landing, Blacklisters, The Austerity Program, Metz, Old Wounds, Sprain, Cloud Nothings, The Catlysts, United Nations, Life in a Vacuum, Regents, Pissed Jeans, pile, Palm, Kowloon Walled City, Slow Mass, Nocturnal Habits (post-unwound), Died, Dope Body, Victor Fix the Sun, Akimbo, etc.\n\nThere's also the modern screamo and midwest emo bands (they're post-hardcore sub genres) as well as hybrids with pop punk, which tend to have their own revival sounds. Examples of the Midwest Emo revival include Marietta, Snowing, the Hotelier, Algernon Cadwallader, Old Gray, Midwest Penpals, Camping In Alaska, Sorority Noise, Origami Angel, The World is a Beautiful Place and I am No Longer Afraid to Die, etc. There's also some bands with elements of post-hardcore like Prince Daddy & the Hyenas, PUP, or even a Japanese indie band like Mass Fermenting of Dregs (takes after number girl style post-hardcore) or Tricot. For screamo there's stuff like Touche Amore, Pianos Became the Teeth, Iwrotehaikusaboutcannibalisminyouryearbook, Beau Navire, Frameworks.\n\nNewer (atmospheric) Sludge Metal/Metalcore/mathcore hybrids tend to have post-hardcore influences. Time to Burn, Neurosis, Celeste, Amia Venera Landscape, etc.\n\nLastly, modern Math Rock bands can have differing degrees of post-hardcore or midwest emo revival elements in them as their roots are in bands like Slint, Don Caballero (which started post-hardcore), or June of 44. There's also a few post-rock and slowcore bands that take more after that style than they do of earlier types of post-rock/slowcore, like certain mogwai tracks (like herod was supposed to be named after slint, plus there's a dummer that was in a phc style band prioe), the mercury program (they literally have an article about how the guitarist was inspir\u00e9 by post-hardcore and punk/hardcore), cerberus shoal(started as emocore), the hosemobile and potentially maserati (I have no proof on the last unlike the others but it just sounds the part on the first album and they had a split with a phc band so they must at least be aware the genre exists)", "created_utc": "1665928325.0", "edited": "1666437363.0", "id": "isjj79r", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_y1iy79", "parent_id": "t3_y1iy79", "score": "3", "subreddit": "PostHardcore", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s2pv"}, {"author": "DIYDylana", "body": "Wow I relate 100% except for the guy part.", "created_utc": "1665859459.0", "edited": "False", "id": "isg3x3a", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_y4mx7s", "parent_id": "t3_y4mx7s", "score": "1", "subreddit": "aspergers", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rm6u"}, {"author": "DIYDylana", "body": "Thank you for the information!

I think that the artist is very important in making art what it is (hence I find ''Ai Art'' super uninteresting) But the social concept of ''the artist'' is different form the ''person''. They're related and relevant to each other and one can't exist without the other, but not inseparable, and it really shows that you should never idolize the artist as a whole and get too attached. It's like how you could like a youtube persona or a therapist, but not stand hanging out with them in personal life, only a certain part/role/state/perception of them appeals to you.\n\nAs for when problematic elements are left in the actual work, well, it depends on to what degree and why it was that way as to whether I can tolerate it, even if I'll always critisize it, lots of media I love has socially problematic elements I don't like, which are a sign of the social climate they were made in.. Though sometimes I end up finding media I find messed up interesting regardless of whether I truly ''like'' it. But I do have to admit that when I find out things like these, it sours my experiene of the work I like due to how it recontextualizes certain decisions. But that doesn't mean I stop liking it entirely (usually at least).\n\nI do not understand it when people get mad for merely mentioning jk rowling let alone Harry Potter let alone liking Harry Potter. Plenty of media has shitty people behind it. I like harry potter. I won't stop liking it,  I just won't support its creator. I don't think there's anything wrong with liking it, doesn't mean I condone every underlying problematic influence, the instant guilt by association with a series feels super reductive, impractical and un-nuanced. Also, it's kind of a slap in the face to everyone else involved with the movies and stuff. Any fan of harry potter I will judge on an individual basis, if they condone her views, then I disapprove of them for condoning her views, not because they are harry potter fans. JK Rowling fans as a person in general though..that's a big red flag right there. Like it can be different but it's not a great sign.\n\nIf you are personally uncomfortable with harry potter because of JK Rowling and would like to stay away though, I wouldn't blame you, everyone's level of tolerance with association is different, and their experiences too. I've stayed away from black metal for a while because I was introduced to it by a racist and the bands he liked were well, made by racists. I'll respect your wants to not want to talk about it or associate with it, but please respect my desire to still like the series for the aspects that aren't problametic.\n\nUltimately I just stop spending money on things (unless its second hand from someone not a scalper or whatever) I know are from people who are shitty enough to have a negative effect on things, especially things relevant to me personally which is the case for jk rowling. But there are other ways to experience their creations. I don't really do this for practical stuff I need in my day to day life though, to be fair, most big companies are bad in some way or another. But with entertainment it's very optional and more personal, it's easier for me to not support someone with entertainment than it is to decide what food I need to buy to stay ethical.

Often this was used as a synonim for ''Gender'', I believe gender was first used simply as a grammatical category for noun classes (It's actually related to the word ''genre''). I think sex came first? Certain traits co-occur together a lot and certain categories have different averages and common degrees of traits. It can be hard to look at a single trait and discern someone's sex from it, but someone's sex definitely effects a lot.  How physically feminine and masculine people are on an objective level can vary greatly, but things still come down to me to having a category that under normal circumstances can at some point produce sperm and another that has eggs. I believe that ''neurological sex''/''brain sex''/''subconcious sex'' is a part of these traits, and that ''gender identity'' sits a bit in between as a concept. I've seen some others who actually categorize that stuff as ''gender'' and the other physical traits as ''sex''. In their system, anything in the brain and mind would be gender and the rest of the body would be sex.\n\nI see gender as a combination of A: the way people intuitively or sunconciously and socially perceive, interperet, categorize and deal with physical sex characteristics and B: the additional social conventions such as gender expression (in things like  femininity/masculinity/androgyny), gender roles (Various norms, expectations, roles, associations assigned to a particular identity within a society), and extended gender identities that go beyond sex and may or may not involve feeling like belonging to a certain social group, that were derived from and associated with the initial two main categories of man or woman, but now also exist somewhat on their own separate, but related level.  Most people online separate sex and gender just like I do, but they tend to completely gloss over A and focus on B.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\--------\n\nSome additional thoughts:\n\nWhen it comes to A, what IS isn't really as important as how it's perceived, which can differ by person to person moment to moment (which is why passing is so variable even on the same person). While most have some traits not associated with their category or have them to a lower degree, If enough traits are read as that 1 category, and there is no trait that cancels it out because it's that unlikely to co-occur together, then they'll be perceived as that category on a visual level, until they have more information like what the person identifies as or seeing their entire body. It's not that category 1 needs to have x criterea, it's simply about being close enough combination to fitting either the common or high degree dimorphic ends of the spectrum of traits.  Also, There's a difference between a superficial external identification (differentiating/recognizing people by their characteristics just seeing them walk on the street), a thorough external identification (what a doctor could do through measurements and a thorough look) and internal/self identification.\n\nWhen it comes to B, it seems that the relationship between it and sex can be quite all over the place, but is always kind of relevant. Gender wouldn't be on a different level of other social aspects if it wasn't for its ties to sex, making it more fundamental even when it's the more arbitrary social aspects. There's completely arbitrary abstracts that basically act as symbols for the sex and gender identity like gendered names and socially gendered pronouns. There's social interpretations and associations with common physical traits a particular culture has. As men tend to be a lot physically stronger, a culture might create an association with men and strength, but in a social figurative sense, ''strength'' can then be interpereted and expressed in many ways within that culture just like how every culture interperets ''being polite'' as different.\n\nThere's also social interpretations and associations with what simply 1 category might have been doing a lot, as people are prone to making subconcious associations with patterns. If more men started wearing pants to ride on horses and do work, but women still wore skirts/dresses, then skirts and dresses start being associated with femininity. Then there's stuff that's just really arbitrary once again, like the push for blue vs pink by marketing, which end up as symbols again. Cultures may also kinda just go against the grain and cycle various things to be the opposite. So while certain things are more likely to become masculine or feminine in a culture than others it kinda sits on this new abstract layer separate, yet related to sex and the kind of social gender I mentioned in A. The thing is that although what counts as feminine or masculine or androgynous or neutral or non gendered changes, the fact that these categories exist at all seems to be a pretty human thing to do.", "created_utc": "1664831588.0", "edited": "1664871271.0", "id": "iqxog5l", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_xundey", "parent_id": "t3_xundey", "score": "3", "subreddit": "honesttransgender", "subreddit_id": "t5_11h46y"}, {"author": "DIYDylana", "body": "Yup I've always seen them as the modern take on the arcade game, kinda funny coming from what was initially an rpg genre, a genre known to be the exact opposite.", "created_utc": "1664781966.0", "edited": "False", "id": "iquvgc0", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_xu44gb", "parent_id": "t1_iquv04k", "score": "1", "subreddit": "Games", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhwp"}, {"author": "DIYDylana", "body": "Contra takes like 15 to 20 minutes actually.

Nes games tend to be more like those longer arcade games, unless they're more adventure, action adventure or rpg. The games used to not have a save feature so they were always designed with 1 sitting playthroughs in mind. I think sakurai wanted to avoid metal slug 3 syndrome where things just really dragged on in 1 sitting. In kirby's superstar you can just tackle subgames 1 at a time.

More an off shoot of modern new york hardcore scenes. It came out of new york hardcore bands slowing down, getting heavier and more metallic, taking slow thrash/groove metal riffs, which became its own subculture, and then eventually bands fully mixed that with metal to create metalcore.\n\nExamples: Earth Crisis, Integrity, Rorschach, Ringworm, Botch, Converge, Zao, Turmoil, Morning Again, Acme, Fall Silent, Marauder. \n\nA band like Botch sits kind of between the two, especially on songs where they use less screaming. It's related to post-hardcore band These Arms are Snakes and in the \"mathcore\" subgenre that is a bit more post-hardcore influenced than regular metalcore.\n\nBotch - dali's prying mantis (this is basically just straight up a post-hardcore song by a metalcore band..):\n\nhttps://youtu.be/Hi7D2kmdshc\n\nNote that screamo, a subgenre of post-hardcore, can sound more similar to metalcore, and is more likely to have metalcore influences.

Typically has melodeath inspired clean choruses as well. \n\nBoth modern styles are more melodic. They tend to take a lot of influence from eachother and modern post-hardcores origins had metal influenced bands like thrice and glassjaw so there's many bands with sounds in between. Most modern post-hardcore will have some metalcore esque screaming and most metalcore will have clean melodeath and or post-hardcore inspired parts. Most bands will sit in between but lean towards one direction. However there are bands or songs that firmly sit in between the two like:\n\nFear Before the March of Flames - Drowning the old hag:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/RD3NmlbrDks", "created_utc": "1664708155.0", "edited": "1664710021.0", "id": "iqqhswf", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_wnnkk7", "parent_id": "t3_wnnkk7", "score": "1", "subreddit": "PostHardcore", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s2pv"}, {"author": "DIYDylana", "body": "Just because they can be used as marketing terms doesn't mean that's all they are.", "created_utc": "1664708046.0", "edited": "False", "id": "iqqho0x", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_wnnkk7", "parent_id": "t1_ikc7zpl", "score": "1", "subreddit": "PostHardcore", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s2pv"}, {"author": "DIYDylana", "body": "It's a shame I had to go down this far to find a proper answer. \n\nPost-hardcore and metalcore have different roots, being more in experimental/alternative/unconventional forms of hardcore often mixed with post-punk/noise rock/art-punk (Those were basically different sides of the same thing) and nowadays more various indie rooting genres like indie rock, slacker rock, slowcore, post-rock, etc. Generally speaking, the riffs here are a mix of punk rock/traditional 80's Hardcore with noise rock, art-punk and forms of indie rock. Emo, a subsection of post-hardcore became so big it kinda became one of the genres foundations even in non-emo post-hardcore bands (and most post-hardcore bands nowadays are related to emo), so the vocal styles tend to be very different. The Math Rock style that came from noise rock style post-hardcore on the other hand quickly separated itself from Post-hardcore and just became a general indie/prog/experimental thing which may or may not have post-hardcore influences. \n\nMetalcore came from the slower, chuggier, heavier forms of New York Hardcore (later on beatdown hardcore) that were getting more and more metallic. It's kinda like the opposite mix crososver thrash was (which was Generally fast) while metalcore was naturally closer to something like groove metal. Heavy, metal inspired chugs and more metal inspired screams are the name of the game, while keeping the energy and straightforwardness of hardcore. Despite the similarity to modern hardcore (the later new york/beatdown stuff), It seems like they were rather separated.\n\n By the 2000's melodic death metal based metalcore took over as the standard form and that's what the people here are likely familiar with, which even the many other styles tend to take influences from, and became more associated with \"scene\" subcultures. Meanwhile for 2000's post-hardcore metalcore and emo pop influences became more prevalent in the stuff that was based on more polished post-hardcore like at the drive in and thursday, resulting in that sound, while melodic metalcore would also sometimes have softer, more experimental songs, which then also got its own \"scene' subculture version. That's why people confuse the two a lot nowadays, even though what people really should be asking is \"What's the difference between post-punk and post-hardcore?\". Early on, that distinction wasn't even made. They were just hardcore bands with post-punk vibes or post-punk banda with hardcore vibes. \n\nPost-hardcore has more of its roots in the sorta upper class alternative artsy hipster sensitive geeky whatever you wanna calll it culture mixed with typical punk/hardcore subculture, while metalcore has more of its roots in a sort of tough guy group culture mixed with more typical punk/hardcore subculture.\n\nThe two did overlap a bunch prior though. In the 90's metal/hardcore mixes were so normal that there were bands more in that vein making post-hardcore projects. There were post-hardcore/emo/screamo bands taking influence from that stuff, as well as metalcore (typically of the more experimental mathcore kind) that took influence from Post-hardcore. The most major examples are probably Botch and certain Converge Tracks. Conceptually speaking, mathcore could qualify as its own sort of \"post-hardcore\" but from a different metalcore based scene with a post-hardcore/math rock influence. Especially because there have been other types of hardcore that went down a post-hardcore type route. There have also been early bands like rorschach that had experimental qualities to them. Thing is there's tons of metalcore that has basically nothing to do with post-hardcore, but it does coincidentally have in common with it that it kinda pushed the boundaries of what hardcore could sound like since it kinda became more of its own thing compared to punk and metal.", "created_utc": "1664706941.0", "edited": "1664707950.0", "id": "iqqg9sf", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_wnnkk7", "parent_id": "t1_ik7ph3e", "score": "1", "subreddit": "PostHardcore", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s2pv"}, {"author": "DIYDylana", "body": "I understand the emotion behind it considering how prevelant misogyy, toxic masculinity and sexual harrasment is, but It's super counter intuitive and as an activist one should honestly just know better.\n\nI'm still questioning but while at first I always prided myself and loved to be seen as ''not like the other men'' and I was very pro feminism, later on I started to internalize that stuff.

This can happen in the situation you've described where someone's traits just don't really line up with the commom norms or expectations, but also various conditions like pcos or gynecomastia, intersex conditions, hormonal issues or needing a certain hormone treatment for other conditions. People just don't tend to use the word dysphoria because it's associated with trans people. Social dysphoria also seems to be a thing for either, but obviously, the context and severity behind it js very different.\n\nI don't think this should be confused with body dysmorphia, It seems like it's a different concept altogether, same goes for discomfort with the body from trauma.\n\nAlso ehm, sorry you're going through that..", "created_utc": "1664612624.0", "edited": "1664612995.0", "id": "iqlpj4a", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_xsfnl3", "parent_id": "t3_xsfnl3", "score": "3", "subreddit": "asktransgender", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r4b9"}, {"author": "DIYDylana", "body": "\"wanting to be trans\" could imply different things here. It could mean the idea that all it takes to recognize someone as to being trans is if they say they are. This has more to do with external identification (as in allowing others to distinguish what you are and have) by soceity, moving on from observing characteristics to asking the persons self identification. It is simply something practical, though it can have its issues since not every trans person would be aware and plenty don't really want to be trans, but it would make sure that any trans person who does gets what they need. This self identification works a lot better for your gender rather than your cis/trans condition, but I believe the underlying sentiment is the same. \nThis seems to simply be a tactic to go against gatekeeping, but going in the absolute opposite direction ironically presents the opportunity for people to pretend to gain something out of it or be likelier to be mistaken and detransition, something which transphobes/gender criticals/terfs will use as fuel to invalidate trans people all together.\n\nHowever, to say that any of the \"non dysphoric\" group isn't trans is reducive and generalizing. The condition behind being trans isn't the same as dysphoria imo (at least now how its described by the dsm), and dyshoria is experienced and described in different ways and there are people with different forms and dgrees. I could definitely imagine someone having some kind of mismatch but without the supposed \"distress\" from dysphoria. Then there's people who do have that distress but they simply define or view it differently, in which case it is semantics. If we are going to sit here and dictate what kinda dysphoria someone needs and how much, some actual trans person will probably be screwed over, and I think not letting that happen should take priority.\n\n I suspect that the group doing it more for social/political or confusion reasons technically aren't \"trans\" as a condition, they are just recognized as the new \"trans\" social class along with actual trans people. I'm not one to go around calling anyone trenders or anything, but we have to acknowledge that yes, there is some kind of trend and worldview getting popular online that's been getting into real life. Again, this can guve fuel to transphobes, mess up priorities for resources like community support, mess up the social conciousness and discourse, be disrespectful towards people in an actually marginalized group, etc. That said, acknowledging that there's a trend can in and of itself fuel transphobes which is probably why a lot of people don't want to admit it, but I think pretending it's not a thing is just not a good tactic in the long term.\n\nThe other interpretation is that the underlying condition of transness can be had as long as you want to have it. I'm also bringing this up because it can feed into the transphobes sides idea that trans people just become trans because they felt like it. \n\nThis idea doesn't make much sense.  Why would you suddenly want to misalign? If your brain is in a state of cisness then there isn't really a reason to want to be trans. You're already what you really are deep down/want to be. It would have to be masochism, yet the not really trans group tends to sort of act like transness is the best thing that happened to them. \n\nIt downplays the concept of dysphoria as then you could just..wish your dyshoria away by not being trans. It makes you wonder why someone would even want to be trans given the dysphoria and transphobia. I only want to be trans in the sense that then I could be a woman, but transness in and of itself is well, difficult. The only reason I want to be trans is because I'm unsure whether I am but I don't want to be male/a man and I want to be femalw/a woman.\n\nThen there's how it makes it look like an extra optional choice rather than a pick your poison kinda choice. (By this I mean a choice like \"I want to start a hobby\", not a choice like \"give the robber money or deal with a bullet in your leg\" the latter of which is the kinda \"choice\" a trans person tends to deals with). The only choice here is whether you transition or not, but the transness will always be there. If you acknowledge how serious dysphoria can be then someone who is not dysphoric would likely actually get dysphoria when transitioning to the opposite sex, unless they are sex apathetic and could be fine either way. If transitions were always 100% perfect and effortless then I would at least be able to appreciate my gender/sex more than taking it for granted by having experienced transmess but that's beside the point that's like saying I want a broken leg which then gets fixed so that I can appreciate my broken leg.", "created_utc": "1664610853.0", "edited": "1664611571.0", "id": "iqlnir9", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_xsmhdu", "parent_id": "t3_xsmhdu", "score": "8", "subreddit": "honesttransgender", "subreddit_id": "t5_11h46y"}, {"author": "DIYDylana", "body": "I see this view all the time and it's so reductive.

They're also not going to come with like, I dunno, deep solutions or criticisms it seems to more just point something out and vent at it basically just directly going ''fuck that shit, stop it'', which is pretty standard fare for punk music.

''A Thousand Lies'' where politicians get away with a bunch of crimes that the people don't, even literally using the word ''hypocrite''.  The intro of ''Deficit'' has this line: ''We're all responsible? Who's this \"we\" you're talking about?I'm not the one with the credit cards and the mortgage I can't pay back. ''. ''Can you smell the irony'' is about this idea that the military makes it look like it's ther to to protect us but wars cause all these innocents to die.\n\nThe song ''Frustration'' has the line ''You say beauty is on the inside, but you put models on every page!''. ''Myths and lies and hypocrites'' is about hypocricy when it comes to religion. ''America'' also applies, as it's about how britain acts like it's better than america but they're just as bad and try to emulate america in ways. It's not like it's most of their songs that are like this, there's a bunch of personal songs as well such as very personal songs like one about having anxeity, a friend commiting suicide, getting into arguments with a friend and cutting eachother out,  going through beating cancer, their own substance abuse, or just other things they find fucked up behavior and issues in soceity without that emphasis on hypocrisy, like the invasion of privacy, the right to die, war ad campaigns, overpopulation, abortion rights, etc.\n\nIF I'm going to mention a song that I think is questionable, it''s ''Zombies'' which is about climate change.

An exact taxonomy of sort is likely not going to work or be all that practical. We can't assume too much, and people will have different language, experiences and interpretations of even the same phenomenon. There's this weird thing where now people want to make their own super specific labels, but at the same time want to brroaden definitions of \"trans\". \nI don't think it should necessarily be about the labels but we can still have the discourse reflect these ranges of how people are rather than kind of projecting things?

My identity is dependant on what type of physique I feel like I should have. You know how there's intersex people but they still strongly identify with 1 sex/gender? Sorta like that? Essentially, It's how my mind sees my sex (or at least, what sex it would be most comfortable being), regardless of what the rest of the body is like, that'd be my gender identity. Now it could be that I am comfortable with some characteristic that doesn't line up, but ultimately, my mind says that sex x is the one for me. So even if your body doesn't conform in ways you'd be okay with, the mind does. I think our essence lies more in this part of the mind than externally recognizable characteristics because if a trans person would take a pill that makes them feel like their agab they often report that they would stop feeling like them as people. \n\nGiven that socially x sex is associated with x pronouns, names, expression, etc, that's what I gravitate towards. Even if people who don't can do those things, their entire existence their sjgnificance is there because sex is a thing. Without that recognition, it becomes as you say, a lot less meaningful.  Yet when people try to separate SOCIAL gender and sex, it's asif they just want to ignore sex and focus entirely on gender and act like it has little to no relation to sex. This is reductive to me, my sex related identity is way more important and different than I dunno, other social categories like nationality or subculture. \n\nFor me, when I want to separate the two, it's more that I think social gender is way more arbitrary and not the core of the issue, I want people to realize that just because someone looks like 1 sex that doesn't mean they are that sex, and that anyone of any sex can di whatever with gender expression they want. That's not really what the current model is about though, it's about social \nand a sort of psychological  gender first. Sometimes I feel like the idea is more for people to medically transition so they match more with what soceity expects rather than what their body expects, according to this model.\n\nThe thing is, I don't \"feel\" like a woman or a man in some vague inner feeling sense I just kinda feel like \"me\", but my current physique isn't really matching up. It seems like this inner abstract sense of \"feeling\" is now gender identity, while what I am referring to is usually called brain sex/subconcious sex/neurological sex if ever brought up at all (I don't really like Brain sex because it sounds like it's more about having a sexually dimorphic brain which isn't really what I mean at all I just mean that there's a part of the brain that would indicate what sex you identify with). \n\nWhat nowadays is meant by gender identity is.. much more complicated and abstract and even though it seems to be important to some of my friends I frankly just don't really understand it and honestly, it seems to be confusing the shit out of cis people more than anyone else?  To the point we've gone a step backwards in both cis peoples understanding of binary trans people and embracing gender non conformity (which is really unfortunate if you're a non conforming non passing trans person...)\n\nLike don't get me wrong people experience gender and stuff differently. We don't have too many facts yet either. I try to be respectful of how people feel even if I don't understand it because you know, my parents don't understand me either. (though Ehm, recently I've realized I think the xenogenders just go unecessarily overboard you can describe abatract aspects of your gender without making it a whole new gender). I'm not gonna sit here and say who is really trans and who is cis, they're individuals, and I don't think a trans person not being all that dysphoric means they have to not be trans. \n\nThe thing is that I feel like the discourse is just done in a way that confuses people more than it makes things more clear?

One of them had more to do with fulfilling/performing a role in soceity so much to the point you become that thing which was more common in the past, Another had more to do with being authentic to your inner self rather than any mask.  I don't remember what names they had..There was another one as well he observed to be there that was more like a social media profile/persona you built up to choose how you're represented. Anywho my pointis I think for them it's not just things like looks and mannerisms or even gender roles, but more like, living up to the identity of \"woman\" or \"man\" or whatever by expressing that to the world in general? I'm just guessing. Like telling the outside world you are x thing is a part of that \"expression \"\n\nKinda unrelated, but considering it isn't completely random who picks what, it seems like expression to some degree correlates to what gender you want to conform to (like if you feel like a feminine woman you're relatively more likely to conform to whatever other feminine women are doing) and what type of associations you well, want to associate yourself with depending on how a culture interprets a certain expression. So if I wanna be all pretty and cutesy I'm likelier to pick the expressions seen as \"feminine\" in my soceity, while a \"tomboy\" is likelier to pick something seen as more \"tough\" or at least not as focused on beauty. People who don't really relate much to the average woman may be likelier to have a non conforming expression. \n\nMeanwhile others like the contrast between how they are and how they look. Some ignore the associations entirely and just like the look. But anyone with any identity can express any way, and ultimately the associations we have are cultural/social so they can be changed to whatever. What I'm trying to say is, identity seems to somewhat influence the way people want to express, but it's still completely separate and not inherent at all.

To me, genres are inherently relative, they're not accurate taxonomies, but instead general cultural concepts, contexts and templates. Some may seem to be under the impression they're based on similarity but if you take a look at \"alternative \" genres like \"post-punk\" or \"Indie Rock\" you'll see that they have wildly different sounds, but have a common origin of musical scenes, base influences, movements/waves, asssociations, audiences, time periods, places and general philosophies. First person shooters have changed wildly in tropes over the years even when inside the same sub genre. \n\n\nMetal is seen as a type of rock not because of the way it sounds, but the fact that it was mainly derived from forms of Rock music, and initially came out of the same Cultural space/scene and shares a relation in audience.

You will notice \"genetic\" simialarities in genres, but the thing that makes something a gente is more memetic than anything, and so often hearing a genre description and hearing a single song often doesn't really tell you much about what sets it apart because it's relative and people take influences from multiple genres anyway.\n\nCompletely new genres are unlikely to occur these days because most base sounds have already been made and people have full access to all types of music (unlike old folk/world music which would develop separately kinda like languages), so most genres are going to be derived from others, like how metal came from rock which came from blues/R&B. \n\nSub genres can be formed for different reasons. But they rarely really come to be just because something is qualitively different on its own. If you take videogames, there are several types of shooters and fighters that have never gotten their own sub genres even though they fit all the criterea we usually use for a new genre. On top of that, tiny categories like \"games with double jumps\" are not \"genres\" (which at this point have taken on a new meaning) but merely \"categories\". As such the strict lines are always subjective and to a degree, arbitrary, but some interpr\u00e9tations are much more culturally accurate than others. Genres will always have things that are clearly right, overlapping areas, and grey areas that are debatable. It's not meant to be an exact science, but it gives us an overview of different types of music and musical movements. \n\nThe sub genre has to be culturally and or historically significant. Maybe the fan audience was simply looking for that type of thing and gave it a name. Maybe a certain part of the culture surrounding the music tried to set itself apart from others. Typically what happens is that something significantly splits or alters the audience or culture, which can happen due to sound changes. If the cultural, role and sound changes become separate enough, and a lot of different subsounds start to emerge for that sub genre specifically, it starts to be seen as its own thing as it occupied a different cultural space, while the early stuff will always naturally overlap. Once the later culture starts to not really be influenced by its parent genre anymore. \n\nTake post-punk. Initially, anything with a post-punk sound was simply considered punk rock. They were from the same scene but simply emphasized different elements of their influences (like taking the in your face aspects od the stooges vs taking the experimental elements from the Velvet Underground). But post-punk moved further and further away in sound and culture (often in ways the punk culture just really didn't like) until it became a separate thing, which then birthed \"alternative rock\" family of of genres like alternative rock, indie rock, shoegaze, jangle pop, etc.  Meanwhile if we look at the opposite direction, hardcore punk, it evolved into its own scenes and sub genres, but the thing is that it was similar enough that it never really lost its ties to punk's culture and overall audience. \n\nSame goes for more underground styles of pop punk/melodic hardcore/skate punk. It didn't culturally separate itself from the punk family like post-punk did despite the fact that some melodic hardcore bands sound very different from what any older bands were doing. Even hardcore itself has different standards and a different subculture now due to the dominance of new york style hardcore and metalcore, yet that is still just called \"hardcore\" despite sounding so different. While metalcore fundamentally changes the riffing style, it still has a similar appeal of loud, aggressive music. Post-punk does not. Basically post punk moved on to new things, but hardcore had different takes on old things. Hence post punk became culturally split, but modern hardcore didn't. It's like someone starting a new family instead of making more kids with the same person. \n\nOne exception I can think of is that commercionalized styles tend to go under the same genre name despite having complete different genres and sounds, even if they're very much separate. This has more to do with the general separation of underground and mainstream, but people co-opting the same terms because it is simply the commercial take on an older genre, such as pop punk. The commercial and underground interpretations of the genres tend to differ, but they're often both put under the same umbrella. \n\nAnother thing that can happen is a different separate subculture simply using the same name, even though the two subcultures have separated. This happened with \"scene kid\" takes on genres like emo, metalcore, pop punk, etc. They have the same name simply because they still wanted to use it, and as a response some people have used terms to differentiate it from the old sounds like the older culture calling their pop punk \"mall screamo\" \"scene emo\" or calling their own versions of screamo \"skramz\" as a joke.", "created_utc": "1664032171.0", "edited": "1664033180.0", "id": "ipq396h", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_xmqnbf", "parent_id": "t3_xmqnbf", "score": "3", "subreddit": "LetsTalkMusic", "subreddit_id": "t5_2t4it"}, {"author": "DIYDylana", "body": "My only theoretical explanation is that these posts are made and upvoted by 12 year olds.", "created_utc": "1664030143.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ippytdb", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_xmqd6x", "parent_id": "t1_ippt9h9", "score": "13", "subreddit": "gaming", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh03"}, {"author": "DIYDylana", "body": "Y'all gave me so many bands to properly explore this scene/subgenre!", "created_utc": "1664016661.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ippc1ue", "is_submitter": "True", "link_id": "t3_xm0u94", "parent_id": "t1_ipmcsvn", "score": "2", "subreddit": "Ska", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhe1"}, {"author": "DIYDylana", "body": "All I know is that I don't like him.", "created_utc": "1664012544.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ipp78c0", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_xmkd0l", "parent_id": "t3_xmkd0l", "score": "10", "subreddit": "Netherlands", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r0ol"}, {"author": "DIYDylana", "body": "I think I got it from dyspraxia which is common in people with autism", "created_utc": "1664010464.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ipp4wdc", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_xmeadr", "parent_id": "t1_ipoezor", "score": "2", "subreddit": "ADHD", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qnwb"}, {"author": "DIYDylana", "body": "I have this...", "created_utc": "1664010135.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ipp4j3g", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_xmeadr", "parent_id": "t3_xmeadr", "score": "1", "subreddit": "ADHD", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qnwb"}, {"author": "DIYDylana", "body": "I feel like anki has been pretty bad for getting new material into short term memory compared to an old dutch website we used to use at school called wrts (which is sadly now paid).

It says here that shimeru's core idea is to take a few loosley fitting together things and apply power to it/hold it so that it stays fixed/isn't loose anymore.  Thing is, two  of its derived meanings (closing off and finishing) are very similar to tojiru..Which is probably why some words overlap in usage. Shimeru seems to be the word with way more kinds of usage.\n\nDerived meanings/usages listed there include:  Constricting (mostly body)/High Density > Tension in space or feelings+conclusion (all written as \u7de0\u3081\u308b)> ending something + settling a bill, closing off a space (written as \u9589\u3081\u308b)> Ending work for a bit > Ending work altogether , completely closing something off, locking something, being careful with spending, slaughtering fish and domestic animals, Punishing/Diciplinizing\u3000\uff08written as \u30b7\u30e1\u308b). When it comes to the overlapping closing a space meaning, it tends to use windows, doors, curtains, etc. Do not confuse this for the same sounding different word written simply as \u3057\u3081\u308b which means a causitive ''to let'' or ''to make'' and is used as a suffix, as well as other words like \u5360\u3081\u308b(to occupy, though maybe its related..), or \u6e7f\u308b (to be damp).\n\nMeanwhile the symbolic idea behind tojiru seems to be to have some kind of open space and to then close that space in with something, blocking it, or, to have two ends come together. It's also the word used when something is locked up/locked in, and can be used to mean to stop something that was going on, as well as to turn a manuscript into kanji. It doesn't seem to have as many derived meanings, and tends to be used for closing and ending things specifically. Some examples it seems to use are doors, lids, books and body parts.There's also the meaning of binding something, which is written as \u7db4\u308b but I can't tell whether it's a different word that sounds the same or a derived meaning that's just written differently.\n\nI'd suggest trying to find sample sentences and see what words tend to be used with which in what situation.", "created_utc": "1663860591.0", "edited": "1663862378.0", "id": "ipha3mb", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_xkz1tk", "parent_id": "t3_xkz1tk", "score": "1", "subreddit": "LearnJapanese", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qyls"}, {"author": "DIYDylana", "body": "Everything", "created_utc": "1663844802.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ipgbvm2", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_xkb5di", "parent_id": "t3_xkb5di", "score": "1", "subreddit": "aspergers", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rm6u"}, {"author": "DIYDylana", "body": "*sigh* I know the feel of not feeling like a good person...

It's awkward in Anki because it was designed for daily, long term reviews of a large deck within a spaced repetition system aiming for a 90% retention rate, you reviewing ahead only messes with its spaced repetition scheduler based on the supermemo algorithm, it's counter intuitive to anki's goal, hence it's awkward, but possible. I personally recommend Quizlet for what you want to do with more short term memory (or if you're Dutch, WRTS), though it's not open source, is mainly online and you gotta pay for more features.

When someone says a place name, do you always know what it is? When someone says a company or product name, do you always know what it is? No, because it's super specific to what you are doing and when. What about peoples names? You don't know everyone's name, yet they'are always the center of attention in the sentence. ''Blergaburg loves cake''. That's cool, but I don't know who or what blergaburg is so what the hells does this sentence relate to? What about fictional tv shows with all kinds of proper nouns you've never heard of? You learn new proper nouns everyday. Mario has Goombas, Fire Flowers, Toad's Koopa's, Star Rod's, whatever. It never confuses people all that much. Well, specific vocabulary isn't all that different.\n\nIt's the same when I go ''My router broke yesterday''. If you''ve never had internet..What the hell is a router? All we know is that it broke.\n\nYou don't need to know every word. You simply need to know the general words we use to talk about and describe the specific words, and then you simply need to know the most common words within a specific field, as well as some umbrella terms and concepts so you can ask what those things are when you don't know them (like if I know what a ''vehicle'' is then I have an easy time figuring out what a tractor is). The exception is stylistic differences, people will often replace various general and basic words with different slang ones or idioms. Another thing is that people will also often make up words for specific phenomenon that are common in a certain social setting or seen as culturally relevant. See the twitter  internet slang word ''ratio-ing'.\n\nYou'll have to accept that you won't know certain words and will need to work from context, asking and looking things up. Even natives will sometimes not even notice that a word which was used is one they don't know because the meaning was clear from context. Don't freeze when you see the new word, work your brain and think of what else could fill those blanks. Thankfully, the overwhelming majority of words are compounds or just using old words in a new context, and will give a hint of their meaning within the name of the word. Sometimes we even make up compounds on the spot that aren't in actual proper use just because they make sense in context. As you go on you'll get better and better at guessing the meaning of compounds. The reason we understand one another is because we all share the same foundation and have been exposed to similar patterns, not because we know all the words.\n\nTry specializing in whatever things you feel like you're going to need to know more about.

But I never really know much about what's the actual current state of myself. My sense of self feels very..Fragmented. You know how everyone has different parts of themselves but they make up 1 connected whole where each part comes out in different situations and moods? Well, it feels like for me they have separated to some degree, I can't find the ''whole''. It''s just a bunch of disconnected random bits and pieces. (Edit: I also often feel like there's different polar opposite people fighting in my brain)\n\nI feel like I've masked or surpressed myself so much in my life to avoid people getting mean to me about my autistic traits that I can't tell the difference between what's naturally me, what's learned, and what's me pretending in order to deal with the situation. I know everyone adapts to social situations to some degree but the problem for me is that I literally can't tell. A lot of my behavior ended up being very deliberate, Instead of just ''being'' I choose to, and so sometimes it feels more like I made myself feel something than that I feel something. This makes it really hard to figure out how I actually feel and what I am. Sometimes I literally have to play a character just to express my authentic self to the outside world. It feels really ironic, but it's because things just don't go automatically.\n\nYou can also add to that that I'd often disassociate to get away from the shame I felt for being autistic, and the resulting depression and anxiety.

I've only studied it in Japanese, but I feel like people get hung up over the words \"topic\" and \"subject\" which seem like synonims but aren't. The concept is totally different, It's just the name that's similar. A subject is strictly a grammatical (functional) role/relationship, the thing doing or being something in the sentence. That role is equivalent to the \"Nominative case\" in languages with noun cases. It's very syntactic. \"i eat cake\" , who is eating the cake? \"I\", it's the subject. It doesn't really matter what the conversation is about it will always be the subject of that sentence in a grammatical sense. What was said before or after doesn't matter too much. Though, the subject is often dropped from the sentence altogether making it confusing.  Sometimes it may not even have much meaning at all and is just there because it's expected to be there. The question id typically \"who is doing what in the sentence\". \n\n A topic marker introduces or emphasizes the topic of conversation in a more semantic (meaning) or information sense, the role of who is doing what ir whatever is irrelevant. It's about information structure, not about grammatical relationships. It's just specifying what you're talking about. You're prioritizing different pieces of information while communicating.  As such what is said before or after the sentence is very important. It's about the topic of conversation after all.  You're not going to keep re-introducing the same topic over and over, there often needs to be some kind of contextual reason, such as contrast or someone not knowing what you're gonna talk about.  The question is \"what information is being conveyed\". \n\nImagine someone sitting somewhere seeing a dog and making this compound sentence: \"that dog, it's pretty cute isn't it?\". Here \"That dog\" introduced the topic, and the grammar structure changed. It limits, prioritizes or emphasizes whatever the next thing you say is going to apply to, it's that thing you 're talking about, not something else. Notice that in that sentence, the subject is actually \"it's\" not \"that dog\". That dog would get a topic marker, but \"it\" would get a subject marker because it's the thing actually doing the action of being cute. \"It's pretty cute isn't it\" would be called the \"comment\" of \"that dog\". It's a different type of relationship. \n\nThis difference often results in the meaning of the two overlapping in both usage and meanings but sometimes having very important differences in usage or meaning.\n\nThe thing is that different grammatical concepts(grammatical categories) are expressed more often in some languages than others and in different contexts, and are \"marked\" differently. So in English, it's not used very often and either unmarked or marked by a dislocated or cleft sentence. In Japanese (and I presume korean), it's fundamental and extremely common with its own set of nuances. \n\nOtherwise it seems like people get hung up on when they need to use which in nuanced situations. The thing is that's the case for almost any basic/fundamental grammatical expression in a language. It's like wondering whether you need to use \"in\" \"to\" \"on\" or \"at\" in English. Sometimes these will be used simply because people use them. The underlying concept is simple but it's often not logical when used for other things, it's about usage and structure, not necessarily about following the original idea.  \nThe concept is simple but the details are more about  being exposed to tons of different social situations, styles and word combinations so you start to internalize patterns and get a feel for it. It's the type of thing for which maybe you can study some major situations, but otherwise, it's something you don't learn in your grammar studies but kinda just build up overtime through practice.  I feel like what would help is to just give some examples of common situatuons in which the difference is significant.\n\nEdit: Also, set expressions should probably be learned on their own.", "created_utc": "1662221738.0", "edited": "1662318534.0", "id": "imxx2q1", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_x4ro3b", "parent_id": "t1_imx9muq", "score": "11", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "DIYDylana", "body": "Adverbial pronouns in French.", "created_utc": "1662220672.0", "edited": "False", "id": "imxuf2h", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_x4ro3b", "parent_id": "t3_x4ro3b", "score": "5", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "DIYDylana", "body": "It wasn't supposed to be categorized yet, I accidentally copied the tag from the 2 entries above.

Cause the material tends to be rather different due to differences in the typical demographics.\n\nI've heard lots of straight women watch mainstream lesbian porn because it actually shows women's pleasure and not necessarily in a way that feels degrading, it's easier to empathize. They're not necessarily into the women but more into what they're feeling and the scenario they're in which they would like to feel too, just probably not from a woman. It's more about what's being done to the women qnd that they're enjoying it. Though I've then heard plenty of lesbians say they find mainstream lesbian porn hard to watch because it's so clearly made for straight men and that it's just too fake for even the Willing suspension of disbelief, so to say.  I've also heard plenty of women watch gay porn instead as they tend to look more appealing and seem more into it or something. \n\nMainstream video straight porn isn't really made with women in mind, at least most of the time. The target demographic is obviously cis straight white men. As such, there's not much focus on the guys (nor their looks) for the girls, and yet at the same time there's not much focus on the woman's pleasure. The scenarios and presentation aren't made to be appealing either.  That's not to say different demographics can't like stuff, individuals have different preferences and tolerances, I'm just saying that if the trends in something from a particular demographic don't appeal to you then it's not weird for people to try to get that something they're missing out of something else even if it's not exactly made for them.  I'd also say those demographics contribute to how I've heard women tend to read more than watch stuff compared to men, and men tend to be more visually oriented so that adds to it yet again, as well as who watches more amateur stuff that caters to something more specific. \n\nYou may need to ask yourself what you find appealing about the videos. If the actual women themselves are appealing, then there might be something up, but even then, you may find something about them or them in that scenario attractive, without necessarily wanting to do something with them yourset. It might just be appealing as an observer for example. \n\nI'd also like to say that just because you like watching something doesn't necessarily mean you like doing that in real life.

Often when people outside of the group care it's because they have some kind of personal relation, like maybe my mom may care about autism because her child is autistic. Sometimes you can get people to care if you speak up a lot, it can cause their current priorities to change or people to become aware of a problem they didn't know was there, and well, some still won't care but if the pushback is significant enough they will want to quiet that pushback down so they may give in to keep things going steady.

It's just kind of unavoidable right now unless we want to limit our communication.", "created_utc": "1660372032.0", "edited": "1660372245.0", "id": "ik3kq6j", "is_submitter": "True", "link_id": "t3_wmq7ok", "parent_id": "t1_ik13x6s", "score": "1", "subreddit": "honesttransgender", "subreddit_id": "t5_11h46y"}, {"author": "DIYDylana", "body": "Yeah I feel like people underestimate the influence our physical difference can have. It's just that one culture may have a wildly different interpretation and conclusion and circumstances for them but there's a reason certain things tend to be associated with one group first and not the opposite. The social ideas aren't completely randomly distributed in the groups, at least not initially. You can often justify any social thing for any reason \"it's manly to have long hair if you win loke that in battle despite it being in the way\" but often it's still rooted in some kind of idea like \"strength for men is important to our culture\", or \"Male pattern baldness = head hair is more feminine\" or \"more body hair on men on average = body hair is masculine \" which can come from physical differences. But maybe another culture finds strength for women just as important but for other reasons. It may be a little arbitrary but my point is that some gender norms are derived from physical norms, others are more like abstract symbols/names, while others are complete fabrication, yet people act like that's all one in the same. \n\nI'd like to compare it to another social concept for paralels: Politeness. It differs in all cultures, yet.. Is it inherently a bad concept to have? I don't think so. Do I find some norms relating to politeness to be silly? Sure but I think the underlying sentiment is alright. I'd say the same for gender. I'd also say there's certain things that are just more likely to become considered polite within a culture for more practical, physical and psychological reasons than others. Same with gender. \n\nStraying from the norm is totally cool. I love vareity in life. But obviously there will be some things that are just more common, and one of those things is people following a certain degree of conformity because they don't want to stand out too much \nin some ways or don't feel strongly enough to not just go with the flow which is fine too. Let's just make sure people can do all those things in a healthy manner without overly judging eachother too much or excluding people for no reason. Not follow unhealthy things blindly or for the opposite go against things that are useful for no real reason (basically what overly edgy people do). It's okay to question our norms. To relate that back to gender, there shouldn't be one single way to be masculine or feminine or a man or a woman or human/whatever in between and outside.\n\nIdeals are fine to strive for. I saw a documentary about iceland's gender equality and well, they're doing well for themselves and are still working on maintaining and improving it. Lots of toxic ideas from over here seem to be way less prevalent there, kinda similarly to how these days the racism in my country is a lot less severe than in the past. But we always have to remind ourselves that ideals are kind that, ideals to strive towards. They're not always realistic outcomes and if you're not keeping that in mind you can actually get some detrimental effects. For example, I really like the ideal idea of things like Anarchy/socialism/communism or whatever but in practice they can turn into absolute diseasters  if not done with caution as you're still dealing with different humans and different circumstances", "created_utc": "1660370631.0", "edited": "1660371714.0", "id": "ik3iqw7", "is_submitter": "True", "link_id": "t3_wmq7ok", "parent_id": "t1_ik2qb32", "score": "1", "subreddit": "honesttransgender", "subreddit_id": "t5_11h46y"}, {"author": "DIYDylana", "body": "I sometimes see the complete blank slate theory but I don't really believe in it. I feel like everyone has a certain \"initial nature\" of what they're like which changes as you're raised but can only change to a certain extent. So for example, I've seen tons of personality differences in family members even when raised a similar way way very early on.  Some of that nature is very variable, but others are distributed unequally or very general (most people want similar base things to some degree to feel mentally healthy for example). I wouldn't be surprised if there were some things that more people were naturally inclined to do regarding gender, or at least likely to do within the circumstances they're in of needing to survive and having the physical trait differences they do. Now that may not be true but the problem is when I see people outright scoff at the idea when they blatantly accept it for many other animals just because we have more complex variables to consider even though our soceities haven't been equal about this stuff for ages.  \n\nI'd argue for example that as long as people aren't living in a fair environment where they can get everything they need and aren't properly educated, it's pretty natural for some kind of inequality to occur. There will be a significant enough portion of people who won't behavr in a fair manner regardless of what the rest are doing. While a lot of bigotry is mostly spread through socialization It probably starts from things like some peoples natural fear of things that are too different for survival instinct or some people looking for dominance in a heirarchy, and then a tendency for the majority to want to follow social norms to survive. A progressive country isn't a natural thing either, it's trying to work around both our natural and socially made up problems as well as we can. But ofcourse once survival is completely taken care of in a free way, I imagine you'd see less inequality simply because there isn't as much reason to.

It's literally how we communicate, it's even how we educate people about the world. We work on associations, assumptions, simplifications, generalizations and categorization, as much as people try to act like those are bad things, they're going to happen to some degree, it's more about whether they happen in a healthy manner and what we do with them.\n\nI feel like people are kind of undermining the potential role sex plays in these gender things and people feel uncomfortable about talking about how it might impact psychology and behavior. It's not just that that kinda thing gets labeled as psudoscientific evopsych, but often as immoral. I think this is odd considering people have no problems doing it with animals, plus there's some statistical differences between genders I doubt is purely just socialization, and also that socialization has to start from somewhere. Just because there's general patterns doesn't mean traits are essential. Obviosly if those things are there, than patterns would arise.\n\nThere's also just percieving ''sex'' itself on a social level, which people also feel uncomfortable to talk about despite it often being the ideal goal in transition. It's like this weird unspoken thing. Yes, there aren't essential sex traits when you're trying to identify someone on the street. But Sex Characteristic Distribution is not equal. Some sex characteristics are highly likely to co-occur together, others no, so certain combinations are rare, especially with the influence of hormones. Some categories will have a particular characteristic to higher degrees on average. Having enough characteristics to enough of a degree, or at least giving someone the impression you have those characteristics even if yu don't (let's say, using breast/hip forms), will have you be percieved of a certain category to most (the exact line is subjective), even if you're not scientifically measurable as that category. Most will have traits from the opposite sex or more like the opposite sex but not enough to where it offsets anything.  Being tall is not an essential trait to men and not being tall is not an essential trait to women. But most men are taller than women, in a relative sense. So tallness is associated with masculinity if you're someone with a bunch of other masculine traits. I suspect that as the world will get used to semi-passing and non passing trans people, that yes, the associations for ''physically female or male'' will change a little, but they're still minirity traits.\n\nBut even IF you would take those physical things away, there's things that arise from physical differences. For example, If women are mostly physically much weaker by default, then in a soceity where jobs are divided, they aren't as likely to let's say, go for a physically demanding job that requires a higher level, and so that job will be associated with men, even though prior maybe jobs weren't as divided to begin with. If women and people taking Estrogen generally have smoother skin and more curves, then when people styalize art it's more likely a culture uses smooth curves to do so compared to angular lines. Now obviously these kindsa things can be interpereted and incorporated in so many ways per culture. It might make sense that considering the strength difference, the male gender role might become centered around ''strength''. But to a culture, what is ''strength'' might differ completely. Maybe another culture doesn't value strength and instead focuses on something else entirely. Also as cultures grow they tend to go in phases of doing 1 thing then the opposite then the other again, as trends tend to want to counter the status quo.\n\nWhat I'm trying to say is that the initial things are probably based in these perceived biological traits, along with abstract symbols for them like names, and then things kinda just develop from there until there's gendered things that legit have nothing to do with anything physical and exist in a completely separsate social layer. The pink/blue thing standardization was a marketing thing, initially it differed per place. The dress vs pants thing has to do with the history with work and horses and the like, even though prior there was no such thing and most people wore skirt and dress like garments.\n\nAssociations are going to happen. The question is what do we do with them an how we mold them. Are we going to tell people that all women have to do X or else they're not real women? No we shouldn't. We can even override unhealthy associations through socialization, hell we can even override certain biological tendencies to certain degrees, especially when raising children, that can override tons of things as you're still developing then. But some of the associations really can't hurt all that much. And well, when it comes to cultural things, it's natural for them to evolve. A typical  punk from the 70's in the US may not look the same in the UK or in the 2010's. but it's still punk. Now, I don't look ''punk'' at all and still consider myself sort of ''punk'' in a sense as I love the music so much and take some of the values, but imagine if there were no typical asociations with punk at all..\n\nWhat would I even be pulling from? Similarly, What women are doing at some place at some time will change, what is non conformist will change, but the fact that there is a division in the first place that is always evolving seems to be something that's significant to people and kind of hard to avoid. There is value in letting people respond to the social norms. Some people want to conform, some people don't , others do exactly what they want all the time, that variety of responses to society seem to be significant in and of itself, not just the things we are able to do.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nalso: Nice to see you again \\^.\\^", "created_utc": "1660333376.0", "edited": "1660336853.0", "id": "ik1c835", "is_submitter": "True", "link_id": "t3_wmq7ok", "parent_id": "t1_ik179hw", "score": "1", "subreddit": "honesttransgender", "subreddit_id": "t5_11h46y"}, {"author": "DIYDylana", "body": "That might make sense, though I feel like some of them are actually kinda basic yet people just skip out on them because they sound longer than some word.

Plus because of the increase in trans acceptance and awareness, we're also seeing a big wave of pushback from the right, influencing moderates. It's very scary to see to be honest, things can get rather risky. Also, while I do think there are some people being rediculous, including actual trans people who go along with these trends in ideas, I am very much against invalidating individuals even though you aren't even sure of what they're like and going through, plus people need to be able to figure things out for themselves. It's just that I feel like we can't just sit here and pretend that there are overall negative trends too for something that is still kind of ''new'' in terms of society actually handling it. To pretend nothing is going on only gives more fuel to the right and online alt right and its ability to influence moderate/unsided people in my opinion. It makes the right look more logical as they go for the status quo most people are used to, when the rights ideologies are actually pretty fucking illogical and insane.\n\nAnywho that's just my speculation.", "created_utc": "1660047876.0", "edited": "1660048354.0", "id": "ijkki4t", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_wjvj5a", "parent_id": "t3_wjvj5a", "score": "1", "subreddit": "honesttransgender", "subreddit_id": "t5_11h46y"}, {"author": "DIYDylana", "body": "There's a significant number of people who feel numb permanently or long term from ssri so I don't think it's a great idea?", "created_utc": "1660038010.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ijk5eqg", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_ozuw5n", "parent_id": "t1_i2ky84l", "score": "1", "subreddit": "anhedonia", "subreddit_id": "t5_2vjtw"}, {"author": "DIYDylana", "body": "I can't find anything online about hearing tests here in the Netherlands that do anything different :/", "created_utc": "1659944159.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ijexqni", "is_submitter": "True", "link_id": "t3_wimwh5", "parent_id": "t1_ijem49g", "score": "1", "subreddit": "hearing", "subreddit_id": "t5_2sb9h"}, {"author": "DIYDylana", "body": "I've seen the thought around a pot but why would you pay respects to the thing that lets you not starve to death when you didn't consent to the situation in the first place?

I wanted post this as I had the song stuck in my head all day and I really feel like Sweep the Leg Johnny is super underrated, I feel like it should be up there with bands like Fugazi and At the Drive In, or stuff like Don Cabalero!. I could have even included post-rock too. Now if you guys wouldn't mind, please let me do some nerdy infodumping :'D.\n\nIt's less that they're a big mix of genres but more that they're at a genre that has a lot of overlap with others. Sweep the Leg Johnny is primarily a post-hardcore band,  the genre that's not necessarily my favorite (that would be melodic forms of punk/hardcore) but the one I feel the most passionate about. They're related to these post-hardcore (and secondarily math rock, emo and punk) bands as far as I could gather, though they had line up changes: ''Check Engine, Haymarket Riot, Swing Kids, Just a Fire, Spana Korzo, Rumah Sakit (closer to modern math rock), The Hertzsprung Gap, Whale/Horse, Gasoline Fight and The Honor System '' , according to ''bandtoband.com''. They've even released splits with other post-hardcore related bands, Streganona, A Minor Forest, Rumah Sakit and Cowpers and one of their album covers is the same as Clikatat Ikatowi's. It's apparent from their early demos too, like the songs \"Disquiet\" that sounds more like early emocore/post-hardcore/melodic hardcore (all closely related genres) without any horns or \"First Steps\" that sounds more like melodic hardcore/post-hardcore and even resembles ska punk at a few parts.\n\nPost-hardcore itself (either more alternative/experimental hardcore/punk going against typical conventions, or hardcore influenced alternative/indie/post-punk/noise rock music, or mixes of both hardcore and the alternative side) doesn't really say much about the sound itself anymore given all of the different takes it has, especially for the more unique bands that didn't get copied enough to fit a specific subgenre.\n\nThey're an example of one of the more unique bands in the genre. I would primarily categorize them as part of the more old school style of math rock that still closely resembles the genres post-hardcore/noise rock roots of bands like Slint, Drive like Jehu or Shellac. A Minor Forest is another band like that, who they did a split with, another example would be June of 44. Don Caballero sits kind of in between, starting more noise rock/post-hardcore but helping with the transition towards the modern style.\n\nI could also say they're one of the more \"vanilla' post-hardcore bands, bands that aren't really tied to a specific subsound but more to major bands you could describe with only the words \"post-hardcore\" like fugazi, unwound and drive like jehu. Math Rock is a more recognizable genre at this point though, and a bit more specific, so I put it at the front.\n\nBut they have the unique twist of having these jazz rock vibes due to the horns and the way it's used. That's super uncommon in post-hardcore. The only others I can think of at the top of my head are abeline, the boom and Karate but they use them differently. This aspect and their morr unique sound is also likely what gets them the \"art punk\" tag.\n\nNoise Rock is a tag that often gets thrown around with post-hardcore a lot. The genre started as mixing post-punk/art-punk/noise rock side of things with forms of hardcore/punk (the two spheres were rather dividrd otherwise), so noise rock is a bit of a father to post-hardcore. From that grew what I call \"noise rock style post-hardcore\" like Bastro, the steve albini related bands like Big Black and Shellac, Unsane or the Jesus Lizard. Early Math Rock before it was truly its own thing was kinda hard to separate from this sound. Later Math Rock often loses out on a lot of its noise rock roots and often goes for a cleaner more tapping based style. Midwest emo revival follows that same pattern. You could say math rock is like an off shoot of post-hardcore that at this point separated, while midwest emo is more like a subgenre. A lot of post-hardcore bands have elements of noise rock.\n\nIndie rock is there as well, it's part of the overall indie sphere and has some of its sound. Most early post-hardcore is a crossover of post-punk and hardcore, but most of the later stuff is a crossover of post-hardcore and indie rock, so most post-hardcore is more of an indie thing now. Math rock as a whole, subculture wise, is more of an indie thing as well. On their bandcamp, they got the tags \"punk\" and \"indie rock\". So I'm using indie as a more general unbrella thing as it's what people are most familiar with. Punk is applicable as an umbrella too but it wouldn't really give people the right idea given that it's unconventional.\n\nAnd lastly as I said, post-rock applies to them too at times at their more atmospheric moments. A lot of the more slint inspired math rock bands had post-rock vibes and they were influential to certain post-rock bands like Mogwai. It wasn't uncommon for these bands to later move on to post-rock and slowcore projects, like slint has Tortoise and For the Carnation. The band related to Sweep the Leg Johnny Check Engine also sounds rather math rock/post-rock.\n\nI think that about explains my inclusions.", "created_utc": "1659765576.0", "edited": "1659782266.0", "id": "ij5l3tv", "is_submitter": "True", "link_id": "t3_wh6i3w", "parent_id": "t1_ij51re2", "score": "2", "subreddit": "listentothis", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qxzy"}, {"author": "DIYDylana", "body": "Hey thanks it says it's related to Ligament and Part Chimp (which I knew) but I didn't know of this band.", "created_utc": "1659735652.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ij3xutm", "is_submitter": "True", "link_id": "t3_wh6i3w", "parent_id": "t1_ij3w4op", "score": "2", "subreddit": "listentothis", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qxzy"}, {"author": "DIYDylana", "body": "Sorry I made a typo it's supposed to be 1997", "created_utc": "1659733970.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ij3trcr", "is_submitter": "True", "link_id": "t3_wh6i3w", "parent_id": "t3_wh6i3w", "score": "1", "subreddit": "listentothis", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qxzy"}, {"author": "DIYDylana", "body": "I was just googling and yes though I don't have ptsd.", "created_utc": "1659720393.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ij2usge", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_d8pmq2", "parent_id": "t3_d8pmq2", "score": "1", "subreddit": "CPTSD", "subreddit_id": "t5_2vvid"}, {"author": "DIYDylana", "body": "Only if I sweat or touch certain thing.

There's no real logic behind it and it's indeed ironic cause a lot of gay men I've seen were very masculine or were into more masculine men than a lot of straight women I've seen.\n\n\nI feel like the feminist language is inherently weighed towards negativity towards male groups because general tumblr internet social justice started looking at privelage in a super black and white way and thinking you can't make equivalent terms for the masculine side because they're either not as severe or in the privelaged position and they don't want to make people think that they're on a similar level. This makes 0 sense to me because even when racism is less severe, like personal instead of systemic, it's still racism, which can be done by a minority group but they'll often claim \"reverse\" racism ain't real even though I've literally seen it happen. Sexism is still sexism even if it's towards the group in power, it's just less severe. But stealing candy from a store and robbing a bank still involve the same comcept of stealing, it should just be treated to the appropriate degree.\n \nThey don't think misandry is real, they think it's just toxic masculinity, but there is no \"toxic femininity\" (even though there definitely are women who say things like \"a real lady doesn't blabla\") or women who have exaggerated feminine traits to such a point it's toxic. Anything is always interpreted and analyzed to come down to misogyny, even when it's more detrimental to men or comes from sexism towards men.  It's always focused on current patriarchical structures but not the underlying general sexism that happens to all genders which caused the patriarcy to happen in the first place. They say you shouldn't gender terms but have stuff like mansplaining and not the opposite even though there have been women that have definitely \"womansplained\" male dating and masculinity to me. Often I notice that instead of aiming for equal fairness there's this underlying implication that because women have had to endure a this fucked up stuff for so long that they get to compensate a little, even though we're not just talking about groups but also individuals, and I also think this sort of \"deserving\" and \"men bad\" mentality hurts trans men.\n\nBut if you support feminisms cause (I do), who is going to go against all that terminology except reactionaries to feminism like mras, or just flat out mysoginists?

These days my views on men are a lot less negative and more realistic though.\n\nI tried a therapist but she wasn't helpful and getting therapists here is kinda hard right now. Whatt made me question was seeing and looking up to Zhea on transvoice lessons, trying out the voice thing cause I like voice stuff and always kinda wished I could sound like a woman during voice acting practice, and I was feeling super numb for ages  but somehow this subject really fascinated me. \n\nThen I ended up feeling really good using the voice, Then I accidentally still had my name changed and people called me she/her/girl and it felt great way better than they them did, then I started thinking about the button question and thinking about having a female body, then I tried some clothes (including a padded bra that made it seem like I had breasts) and loved it, etc. It helped that I saw that not all trans people had that \"I felt like a girl from the inside from a young age\" thing or whatever.  I felt positive feelings I hadn't felt before, and I've been suicidal and depressed for a long time.\n\nRealizing that with training I could just sound like a woman considering I could just do the voice rather than being stuck by what nature decided thing kinda made me rethink everything. This realization that it wasn't some impossible thing I couldn't possibly do and that I'm not feminine enough for, but something that's actually possible. The questioning is basically just about the physical, and the social stuff actually gets in the way for me, the less I think of the social stuff, the more I want to be a woman. \n\nThe problem is I don't remember any clear physical dysphoria or signs prior just a general sense of discomfort with my body, numbness and disconnectedness with myself even though I tried being as open and honest as I could.

It's the internal gender identity not matching with the gender identity people externally assume they have and social stuff that's the core problem for them, and they want to transition so soceity sees them as their identity.\n\nThere is a social construct involved in both, but the Crux of the issue isn't a social construct in the first. On top of that, all language and categorization is technically a social construct but that doesn't necessarily mean that the concept sex is describing is a social construct.

It's about the kinda stuff that has really been confusing me when questioning. \n\nTrans identity in a purely social sense just isn't really the same thing. Yeah, it can also have a more neurological/inherent basis where it's a social interpretation of something psychological and internal, but at the end of the day it's still a social construct interpretation of a sense of self. Gender identity would be a mix of psychological and social both on an internal and external level, gender expression or roles just external and social, and physical gender would be how we externally socially interpetet physical features. But what's going on with us is really just more problems with our gender identity surrounding sex, not gender itself (at least, not if you accept the modern gender/sex distinction, some would argue gender is your subconscious sex instead. You could call it neurological gender vs social gender in that system). \n\nSex isn't really a \"social construct\". The language and categorization for it we use is but that's the case for anything and calling it a social construct for that kinda loses the point for the term social construct. There's a huge difference between something like money or sex. Social Gender on the other hand is closer to money, except for the more internal parts, and it's typically the part we are conciously aware of and it's not asif social aspects aren't important even to binary or non binary \"transsexual\" people (they are usually also \"transgender\"), it's just that for purely \"transgender\" people something different is going on as the core problem.\n\nI really feel like something really weird happened when it come to our political activsm, especially online of which I assume certain queer theory and the terminally online teenagers of tumblr obsessed with privelage, inclusivity, validation and self I diagnosis had an influence. The terminology isn't really based on what's the most accurate nor practical but on what's politically desirable, it seems. \n  \nI think \"assumed\" is indeed better than assigned, clever way for you to keep the acronym. I've also had the issue of \"born physically\" thing because your brain is physical too.\nI would maybe go for \"born externally female\", because the part people actually get to visially see on the outside was femalw, while we could say that your subconscious sex or neurological sex (still physical, just part of the brain) is actually male and this initial mismatch is what caused the transness. Neurological would make clear it's not just a soceity influenced or potentially temporary psychological state like a lot of other types of social identities.  I'd say that neurological part is more important in determining the essence of someone's sex rather than what people see on the outside. It's the one thing you can't take away that makes them them.\n\nI'd say that I wouldn't put in the criterea that it would necessarily need to be a \"male brain\" but more just a brain that would give some kind or mismatch in the appropiate sex characteristics. This gets around a buncha other potential issues.\n\nGiven that our technology isn't perfect yet, A transitioned trans person would then have mixed \nexternal sex characteristics, but ones actually leaning towards their subconcious/neurological sex, but to different degrees. Still, we could say it's close enough to be considered to match the subconcious sex, at least on a less detailed level, as well as a social physical level. maybe mixed sex would be better reserved for people who do a physically rather than social non binary transition.

It's not that black and white it depends on how you generalize whether it's bad. Generalizing is kind of a basic tool of simplified communication, language and understanding, as long as everyone is aware generalizations are being made, that the generalization can be wrong , subjective and that groups aren't individuals either. Our minds are kinda suited for pattern recognition (even if we get it wrong). \n\nThey're just impressions of patterns from feeling like you're different relative to another group, not value judgements, prescriptive things or comments on what most people in a group are expected to be like with racism. Like yeah, not all bananas have the same shape but perfectly describing the shape of each individual banana rather than giving a general simplified description kinda makes it hard to say anything. We do it with everything, I fail to see how it can't be done about people, are people somehow above patterns?\n\n\nIt'd be like someone going \"Why do so many Dutch people use bikes so much I visited the Netherlands and I saw them everywhere\" and going \"You are generalizing not every dutch person uses  a bike much, you're creating a stereotype'. \nBut it IS the general trend because bikes work well within our country and culture. Those impressions are also relative to the experiences someone from another country had. Like I've had people visiting our country note that at least in the north they noted how \"direct\" dutch people tend to be. As an autistic person, I don't think that's true at all, but it shows that there's some kind of \ngeneral difference either between their and dutch culture, or a subjective difference or misunderstanding in interpretation that to me, is actually interesting to look into. Impressions should always be taken woth a grain of salt, but it can be \nmore  interesting to look at what caused that impression rather than the impression itself.\n\nGeneralizations can lead to interesting discussions, even if they turn out to not be true. \n\nI tend to get along better with other autistic people and understand them better. Does that mean I always do or that there's no Allistic people I understand better? No ofcourse not. it kinda goes without saying. I'm just more likely to find my kinda person if I would walk into a group if autistic people. That's it. The interesting question to ask is why without necessarily trying to assume it's because something is inherently essential to non autistic people, That would be prejudice leading to discrimination. \n\nI went to a tiny little IT school and the only woman was a teacher.  There were no girls in the class. Would it be sexist to simply take note of this fact and wonder why? I think sexism would be to assume all women can't shouldn't or don't want to do IT and that if you meet a woman in such a setting to assume she's not knowledgeable in IT but the boys in the office do get that assumption.\n\nIn OPs case, he noticed a gap between how he approached his interests and how allistics around him generally did. And well in my experience there is indeed a general gap. Are there allistocs that love learning? Absolutely. Are there autistics that don't. Absolutely. But I do notice that there's a pattern of less of it among allistics, at least from the subjective relative perspective of someone like me. I often even have allistics people comment on it like \"Wow you know a lot about your interests\". \n\nAnd I think it's due to a combination of the way autistic people tend to approach their special interests vs how allistics do as well as allistics tending to be a bit more socially oriented. And it isn't really a better or worse thing it's just different but obviously if you live in a place with mostly allistics people as an autistic person It's going to be hard to understand. Allistic people project shit they do and are used to onto me ALL THE TIME. I have to explain myself all the time.Their soceity is literally built on the generalities and ideals found in allistic people. Obviously I'm going to be confused about how they operate sometimes.\n\n------+\n \nI do think it's most popular as an insular college educated american thing but it's getting more and more common outside of that. \nWhen something as innocent as OP's question within this context is interpeteted as being comparable to racism and stereotyping  I just don't even want to bother argueing against it, how is this related?

It feels absolutely futile and nobody arounds me cares.\\]\n\nAbout a few years ago I noticed I have a lot of trouble hearing over a background noise, and that my music didn't sound as clear as it used to be. It can be any sound not just loud places. Plus, a lot of sounds just..Sound loud to me, it's asif even soft sounds have pretty loud volume levels and easily drown something out. This especially happened when I was so suicidal that I said fuck it and cranked up the volume on my headphones for a few days, but I kind of doubt that alone was the culprit.\n\nI've also had mild tinnitus for a long time which bothers me whenever I try to sleep, probably heightened by an ear infection I one had and my chronic congestion (especially nasal) from allergies. What sucked is that I realized I did a lot of stuff that could have fucked up my hearing. One of them was the fact that I have -12 eyes so I would try to read the lyrics while singing by putting my face up close to the phone but it would still be at max volume. And I sing a lot often for like 2 hours at a time, and I sing loud. But there's way more examples then that.\n\nSo I tried to do a hearing test and they said it was fine with a few dips here and there. But they only test up to 8khz as that's what the hearing aids help you with and they only test the thresholds, with headphones, and not with background noise. When I turn down the upper ranges on an equalizer I notice that they definitely impact how the music sounds a lot, and people on the phone(which has less frequencies) are definitely harder to hear. Apparently, studies have shown you can even damage stuff  in your head that doesn't have to do with your ears which effects processing. At some point recently I lost my eye due to retinal detachments and the other eye isn't necessarily safe. Ever since my health anxiety skyrocketed. I am extremely suicidal and depressed. The few little moments that make me feel alright? Yeah 99% of them require sight and sound. So I feel like if anything is going to get even a little worse I'm going to die.\n\nSo I've decided to take some precautions and get earbuds and stuff. Especially when I had to do a few band practice sessions recently which I didn't have in the past. But something ALWAYS happens where I feel like I've damaged them no matter how hard I try. Especially because when I look at the statistics, you can't be exposed to something above 90db for very long, and something like 120 db instantly does damage.\n\nI often sleep with a fan due to the tinnitus and when its warm (its much worse for the allergies but oh well) but then my new apartment for like a year long would randomly turn on these 4 fans on the heater cause I did not know how its controls worked. When they were all on it was like, loud, like I couldn't hear properly, let alone with my fan on top of it. Once I went to a Japanese food festival but it turned out we were too late and they were doing an afterparty so they were letting everyone out slowly (It was kinda crowded) then BOOM they suddenly started blasting music so loud that even those people who regularly went to festivals were like ''damn that's loud'' and so I managed to grab my earplugs after a while and even then I could feel the sound in my whole body to the point it felt uncomfortable. Once a neighbor got super high and was BLASTING his music all day (I had my windows open so I could hear it), then another neighbor asked me to open the shared room which is right next to the loud guys tiny room so I had to get past it a few times and was like walking right next to that speaker of his open window without earplugs.\n\nOnce with bandpractice I lost the earplugs so I had to use shitty foam ones, sometimes my earplugs turned out to kinda move out of my ear. Hell, are mine even effective when they're in?   My parents put on the TV and car call volume super loud for long stretches of time, then say ''but our hearing is fine'' when theirs OBVIOUSLY isn't fine, also my parents ALWAYS TALK SUPER LOUD. Once my dad tried to show me 3D Sound on his phone with his earbuds for I don't know how long..Turns out he accidentally had it on full volume, on my ears. Thanks dad. The worst is that my parents are always renovating the house in some way, and then suddenly their machinery is like damn loud and I don't have my earplugs in. Recently I went to a trip with people and I had the plugs on all the time but they were driving on the highway and as soon as I took them off, I thought the windows were closed, but they weren't. I'd hang out with friends in amsterdam and twice the EXACT MOMENTS I took the earplugs off SUPER LOUD MACHINES would come in. Yesterday I was trying out VR ideos on some site and for 2 of the videos instead of actual sound it was SUPER LOUD EAR PIERCING STATIC NOISE so I got startled and almost immediately took it off both times. Other times It turns out I'm listening to something way louder than I think because of the background noise from outside.\n\nThese kinds of things keep happening no matter how careful I am or what I do. I feel like I'm just screwed. People are like don't worry just use earplugs. But even with the earplugs it feels so futile. Something always happens. People tell me my hearing is fine because it was fine on the hearing test. But it's not fine. I struggle to hear so many things even though I always prided myself on having good hearing. The stress and anxeity kills me everytime. I feel like I'm going to be hard of hearing and blind and my life will be even more meaningless than it already is.

It's nice you brought up your JRPG example, I wouldn't have thought of it but yeah it's a thing. I'd bring up early adventure games, which were intentionally made to be rather trial and error with puzzles that effected other puzzles, lotsa unexpected deaths that required quicksaves, dead ends and moon logic. Either you were supposed to just keep trying everything and replaying the game and stuff, or get a damn hint book. I feel like in a game like zork that has a few upsides because it's so easily to quickly pass through it and its short but in later graphical adventure games it's rather annoying to me\n\nJust to be sure: I didn't mean to say financial incentive was never the reason games weren't the way they were, it's why I put that last note about ''extending playtime through challenge and performance'' there. It's indeed a mix of the context they were made for, the business model and the technology. You had public machines on a coin model for which other people also had to play, There were no save systems, limited space to work with, etc.  It's actually very interesting to look at how games their progression frameworks and philosophies evolved over time due to these things, which is exactly something I've been trying to document and make terminology for, but my mental and physical health is always in the way of finishing anything.\n\nI  feel like when the game was actually well designed, these kindsa business model+tech driven designs actually end up in the games favor where you actually get the most meaningful out of a set of content. Blowing through a level often also just means less depth and less purpose, I mean once you consistently beat an enemy in a sport with no effort, people tend to want to move on to a better enemy after all, and people tend to feel more satisfied when there's stakes behind a match. I think there's a certain sense of satisfaction and tension/excitement that is lost in a modern styled hard action game like Super Meat Boy where you can infinitely retry all the time and are meant to make more steady progress (don't get me wrong I love meat boy). But there is a certain ratio where once there is no technological or circumstantial limits, yet devs want to maximize money, you get practices that actively hurt the type of game its going for. Take the mobile game market, or free2play pay2win online market games. The AAA games had been moving to that kinda thing, and that's what I'm complaining about.

But I often don't play them because I'm not good with long drawn out stuff. \n\n\nWhat pisses me off is two things. One is rpg's that try to be infinitely long for no reason in a poor way just to pad things out even more. \u200bTwo is that too many non rpg games just take rpg elements willy nilly and often for the wrong reasons poorly slapped onto some action or strategic set of game mechanics I would actually love to its own detriment. just because it will increase playtime. Which brings us to the point that our time isn't respected and \"more playtime= better value \" is a philosophy that started to dominate so all content is stretched to hell.

I call it the difference between \"play driven experiences\" and \"media driven experiences\". \n\nWhat I mean by the first is that the play driven games focus on just being games which are also media. They mostly focus on being one medium of \"games\" and the rest is secondary. Essentially they work like most early analog games (outdoors games sports, early table and board games) in that they are closer to being generic active activities that people do for fun over and over rather than something like a book or movie or song where an artist set out to create a specific \nusually passive experiences. they were often a simple set of rules people agreed to with generic\"Game medium Entities\" like a ball or a cue stick, or a deck of cards that allowed for a wide range of game rulesets to be played on, while the medium entities of modern video games have very specialized, personally designed ones for specific game rulesets tied to it, which also have to digitally simulate/recreate a lot of things that in real life would just exist in nature. They lack specific \"theming\" and remain abstract.\n\nThe thing is that in video games and modern board games they are what I call \"author games\" where someone or a team set out to specifically design them and owns the piece of media rather than inventing the activity or slowly building it up through a cultural community in which usually nobody really \"owns\" it (which I call \"public games\"). The latter are often much more generic in theming. Like, you can buy super mario bros 3 or the battlestar galactica board game, but you don't \"buy\" soccer or pool games, you buy and arrange the medium entities needed to play them from whoever is providing them and then you simply stick to the rules. Plus there's a lot more associated with the identity of \"Super Mario Bros 3\"( a specific level set of content, theming, music, graphics, animations, world building, character design) than in soccer. \n\nMeanwhile the 'media experience\" ones focus on being a piece of media/entertainment/art as a whole centered around gameplay, or where gameplay is simply one of its elements (take a game like Phoenix wright, its core medium is actually narrative). It's those games where even if you don't love the moment to moment game mechanics you might still be like \"But I loved the experience as a whole'. \nThey tend to focus on a specific or set of \"journeys\" and \"macro\" elements rather than the sum of their parts and moment to moment micro gameplay. They tend to emphasize structure/progression and mix and match various forms of play in a certain sequence to fit the overall experience, even kinds not normally associated with traditional games together as well like unorganized play, puzzles, simulation and interactive fiction. Most importantly they tend to emphasize the importance of different non-gameplay elements of the medium working together in context, and they often heavily emphasize theming. In a game like super mario bros 3, the non gameplay elements are mostly there to support the game mechanics themselves and will often shape themselves to fit the gameplay. But in media experience games, the game mechanics are just one part of the many elements of that piece of media, and mehanics may even shape themselves for the non-gameplay elements. If you want a good comparison, there's Metal Gear Solid on ps1 that's more media experience, and the Metal Gear VR Missions disc that's more play experience driven. I'd say this kinda thing was popularized by Dungeons and Dragons. \n\nTo top it off there's a big difference in what I call \"game finity\" in whether the game feels like it in and of itself has an \"end\" or not within its progression. \"Non-finite\" feels like it doesn't end, \"finite\" feels like it does. Most older games had what I call a \"match structure\" often divided in rounds, like multiplayer games. You don't \"win\" \"beat\" or \"finish\" \"the game\". You win, beat or finish \"the match\" or \"the tournament \" of a game. How can you beat basketball? These are examples that are PVP, but early arcade games that were just endless survival with scoring like pac-man had the same non finite \"match\" progression structure. I call them \"PVS (Player vs system rather than enemy as in PVE) because you directly play against the game mechanics not another rational agent/actor. Then later they made things what I call \"semi finite\" where it focused on loops and getting better scores, but it did have a clear stage progression with an \"end point\" when it came to content like getting to stage 6 or something after 40 minutes. These non finite and semi finite games often had a more \"performance\" based \"progression philosophy\" than a \"beating\" or later \"finishing\" based philosophy. You're supposed to keep trying to see how well you do, not beat it and move on.\n\nThis distinction was very much marked by games moving from simple \"game over\" screens to having an actual \"ending\" I call the \"ending ceremony\". Though often you had to beat another loop to get the true ending.\n\nAll these traits of video games are probably why there's so many more analytical critiques and that it's now that the \"are video games art\" debate is much stronger than analog games where discussion was more about the players, the ''meta'' of getting good, and matches than the actual game design or \"the game\" as a distinct entity. Games have evolved to be much more than just play and its design has gotten more deliberate, and even the simplest early video games already had elements of where this all was headed.\nBut a problem is that companies love money and a modern strategy is to just keep you playing as long as they can which is now easier to do with modern technology. Now it's all about adding a buncha long drawn out content. Back in the arcades it was more about extending playtime through challenge and performance.\n\nBut a split still remains, and I notice that there's a different audience that prefers the more finite stuff over non finite stuff, and another dichotomy of people that prefer more \"media as a whole\" stuff than \"play focused\" stuff.", "created_utc": "1656926893.0", "edited": "1656969525.0", "id": "iesssfb", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_vqoofj", "parent_id": "t1_ieqqe5c", "score": "9", "subreddit": "patientgamers", "subreddit_id": "t5_2t3ad"}, {"author": "DIYDylana", "body": "I feel quite little during, then once I almost have to climax it starts to feel like it's actually pretty alright, but then frustratingly before I actually get to the point it's supposed to feel \"good\" I climax and feel absolutely nothing and it feels super I satisfying to my libido like an unquenchable thirst.

I definitely don't encourage people to be miserable.\n\nI'm just saying that I'll always have to make compromises and deal with something, and some things aren't fixable, even if they're awful, I need to learn to accept certain things. The real takeaway was to make the best of whatever I have to deal with, and that also involves balance. Yes, if I know everything, I can make more efficient decisions with less regrets. But the fact of the matter is I don't know everything. So I have to, like you said, find that balance. don't push yourself too much, but also don't push yourself too little\" is a good takeaway. You gotta try to push yourself even if it gets you out of your comfort zone, but if you unrealistically push yourself to the point of rash regretful decisions, burnouts or panic attacks like I sometimes do, well, that's not going to get you much further than not pushing much at all.\n\nObviously i can't tell you what's best for you or what is going on in your head but I feel like you already seem to know what you want quite a bit. While you should always remain cautious and aware of your decisions until you are genuinely ready instead of rushing, it would be a shame if you waited too long and ended up with more regrets of the very real consequences than necessary just because of fear or whatever. When something's important enough to take the risk, at some point you'll have to get over those fears. The possibility of waking up like a regretful 50 year old is always there, and it is scary. But not only are there just journeys you have to walk to figure out out for yourself rather than getting stuck, sometimes the road and the attempt to progress is more important than the actual result, kinda like when you attempt to win a video game.\n\nWhat can you do that makes it the least likely to happen according to your current feelings, both emotionally and intellectually? And if it does happen, you can at least have done something that makes you not regret that you didn't try. You aren't in control of everything but the fact that you tried can make the world of a difference. I would never forgive myself if I hadn't done my 10 eye surgeries and put in a lot of effort in between them, It may be a bit of an obvious example, but I knew it was the right choice at the time. I could tell myself it was useless because they didn't work in the end despite having gone through some of the most temporary pain I've ever had when it went wrong twice that wouldn't have happened without surgery, and they actually had to fix up some side effects from the surgeries. But it wasn't because at the time it might have saved my eye and if I hadn't even tried I'd be much more regretful.  Sometimes there's gonna be choices where it's a lot less obvious, but the wrong choice could have been the ''right'' one at the time giving the variables you knew and the feelings you had. Sorry if that rambling got a bit too silly.\n\nThanks for talking to me! It feels nice to see someone similar in a way :). Honestly I wouldn't mind just having a chat for the sake of it xP. As insecure as I still am, I used to feel insecure about my own overanalyzing tendencies and people often criticize it but I've learned to see it as a thing that is a strength in some situations and a flaw in others, but one that a lot of people around me simply do not have. I used to feel like it was hard to relate to the others who didn't, but that isn't an issue in and of itself, because we can complement one another.

I've been concluding that I can't move any further through self analysis at this point and that right now. I've been wanting to put an end to this concious introspection arc, but your comment has really solidified that that is the right choice for now. My feelings sit somewhere in between a cis person and your average trans person and I'll have to accept I simply won't have clear answers for now.  A deep metaphysical truth is something I will never notice or feel. All I can tell is that once I genuinely started considering the possibility, the idea of having a female body/voice had a way more positive response in me than any cis people I know that has set me off on a journey which has made me feel positive things I have never felt before. This remains a fact no matter how many counterarguments I can give that don't fit a typical trans, or even a typical woman's experience at all. and I say that as I feel like SSRI's have emotionally numbed me for years after not taking them anymore (which makes it harder to know how I feel, but the fact that I responded so positively despite that says something).\n\nI can relate a LOT to the questions you mentioned. '' \"can I really be trans if I just want to be a girl but don't feel like a girl?\" or \"but why didn't I show any signs growing up\"?, \"what about these sexual fantasies that I have?\", \"what about this thing I feel?\", \"what about that thing I do?\" ''. They constantly keep me confused. And as you said, for any trans answer I could find, I could find a cis one. I was hurrying too, because I might actually be blind in 5 years. There's like a 30% chance my genetically predispositioned retinal detachment condition that took away to one eye happens to the other by that timepoint. I've been looking for like, some kind of name or explanation to take my mind off things but ehm..It doesn't exist. Maybe that's fine.\n\nI'll just have to live my life and see what happens, and as that happens I'll have to figure out whether something is detrimental enough to try the risk of taking hormones. If I do then I'll have to learn with the things I can't change. If it's not worth it I'll simply have to cope with the fact that I can't be female but want to be and I'll have to work around that in my day to day life. They make it seem like it's transition or being miserable but yet when I tell them about potentially being blind even though I already am a mental health mess to which most of the tiny joys require vision and hearing, they'll tell me there's still a point to life even if I was? Coping has literally been the only thing that has kept me alive since puberty anyways. I'm used to being miserable. I'm sure I'll find some way to cope. \n\nFor now I'll let people refer to me as a girl online by default, but not when I use my masc voice, and as a guy in real life by default, but not if I use my femvoice and dress up and stuff or say otherwise. And if anyone asks I'll be ''A guy that doesn't really like being a guy and wants to be a girl'' for now. The irony is that I'm actually pretty good at being a guy -\\_-.\n\n\\-----\n\nI'm sorry to hear about that story about the sub! It's very understandable you reacted that way, you were in a vulnurable position, which is why I don't like communities like that.

On Discord groups I've received some great support, and the occasional comment or chat on reddit has been very helpful too.

But generally speaking there's been a lot of stuff that only makes my questioning more and more confusing. Some of it I don't even think is all that healthy and only gives my mom's point fuel.

I had to retype it in word.\r  \n\r  \nI completely understand! Just to a lesser degree. I started questioning not too long ago (about 1 and a half years) because I saw transvoicelessons. I saw Zheanna and thouht ''she's so cool, I want to be like her!''. Before her I simply questioned wether I felt like a ''man'' in a social sense or not so I went to non-binary identities like ''demiboy'' , and changed literally nothing about my conforming presentation. I simply did not feel an internal sense of gender nor attachment and never really understood all the social stuff. I genuinely did not consider myself trans at that point and didn't want tto be associated as such, even though its said to inherently be part of the ''trans umbrella''. To me, it was more like recognizing most concepts exist on a spectrum and I was on a more atypical part of the scale. While I didn't want to be a man I saw this more as an expression of language rather than me being completely separate from all men. I just thought it was more accurate language to how I socially felt in relation to others.\n\n\r  \nAs soon as I started wondering wether I wanted to be a ''girl'', I was imagining being smaller, having breasts, having a bright voice, narrow shoulder, wide hips, feminine facial features, smooth skin, and different genitals, as well as social stuff associated with them in my society like hairstyle, make up and clothes.. This was a whole different ballpark and to me very much questioning whether I'm trans. Not only was it a completely different gender, but I was thinking about my body. When early om people gendered me as a girl and I felt lots of euphoria, that was simply because that's what what people with a body like that are categorized under in society, while the body categorized as male I didn't really care for. It made me feel like I was recognized as someone who has that kind of sex characteristics. When I tried crossdressing, it simply reminded me of how its usually people with those bodies wearing these clothes. When I had the illusion a female body could be under there, I was euphoric. it's the association I have that makes it work, not the clothes themselves, even if they look nice. I wish I could feel that feminine when wearing less feminine clothing simply because of my body. At least with these clothes I can signify what I want through association both to myself and others.\n\n\r  \nI've said the exact same thing. If those people were called ''doobiedoos'' I'd want to be recognized as a doobiedoo. The social category of woman doesn't mean too much to me. I don't have a concious internal sense of my gender. I only realize I was socialized like a guy and thus have those types of interests. I don't even relate that much to people through gender in either direction though, despite seeming relatively vonforming. It makes sense as I'm autistic. I've always said, I just feel like ''me'' and that me is questioning what body I feel comfortable in. And if somebody would ask me on a deserted island I'd probably still say yes to ''the button'' even if it'd be objectively harder for me in that body. Conceptually I am basically agender. But I've even met cis people who feel like I do about a lack of concious internal gender, the difference is that they are comfortable with themselves, pronouns and their body. I don't even have enough of an attachment to social gender to want to call myself agender. I want to be called whatever sex characteristic category is the one I feel I should be. That's my identity. My identity is determined by the part of my neurology that says which sex characteristic category I feel like I should have. The social part isn't really influencing the identity. But for certain others it seems like the social part has always been way stronger. They knew they were women. Maybe they even related more to women. I've even seen people who want to transition mostly for society to recognize their inner sense of self as their gender. But I don't feel like a man or a woman deep inside, I just feel like me. \r  \n\r  \n\r  \nThis difference is totally fine to me. I won't intentionally misgender, or try to gatekeep peoples rights, or discriminate against them. We're all in this fight together. I'd even say gender non conforming cis people are too, to an extent. But It's simply super hard for me to comprehend their experience with gender and sometimes it downright clashes with my biased emotions. Which is why I ask the questions so I can stop projecting and be more understanding on an emotional, personal  level rather than a rational, moral or political one. A non binary afab friend doesn't want their body they are comfortable with (they feel no desire for medical transition) to be associated with women yet their body is exactly what I'm after when I say ''girl''.I won't feel feminine enough without that body.  Ironically enough, I often socially relate to these people more than your average cis girl. Yet I simply don't want to be non-binary. I don't want my body to be considered a woman, I want to be recognized for this not being the right body for me as a pre everything person. Essentially, I want my identity to center around sex and have the social stuff be reflective of recognizing those differences, without saying I'm not a real womsn just because I was born or look male. \n\n\r  \nThat difference is fine , but the thing that pushes me into these spaces is when people assume I work that social first physique second way myself, and all the language is built around that so I can barely express my issue without making someone mad. Transsexual and transgender aren't talked about as separate concepts. I would feel like I looked too masculine in a particular dress and people would talk about internalized transphobia and how society just needs to change its narrow perception of women. But this isn't supportive for my situation, i fact it almoist feels like reverse conversion therapy. When they say ''woman'' they mean this untangible social idea. But when I say woman I mean that what my neurochemistry wants isn't matching up with the body. And it has led to responses I find confusing and at times downright offensive. \r  \nI don't really have a space I can relate to. In most progressive spaces anything is valid and can be anything. I'm not a fan of vague positivity I want actual theories and experiences. Agender people don't tend to want to change their bodies or be called women. A lot of trans women, even ones who are clearly transsexual in concept, still emphasize feeling like a woman and that being more important. trns mdcl and trs cm places are spiteful and gatekeepy, and I don't even agree on the ''you need dysphoria'' criterea thing even if the more socially oriented people hadn't existed. \n\n\r  \nIf a femboy takes HRT and passes, they're essentially already what I want just without the name. To me this is hard to fathom. If I was cis, (I dunno whether I am yet) this kind of transition would make me dysphoric, And where does that leave me? Suddenly I'm physically the same as a man. Not because they're a dysphoric trans man, but because a man voluntarily took estrogen. Iys asif the incongruence makes them happier not feel worse. This is suuuuper hard to fathom considering how my mind experiences gender. It doesn't sound very cis to me either.

Take a band like Jawbreaker, which is inspired by early emocore. The thing is that the connection between melodic hardcore and emocore was always strong, and pop punk grew out of melodic hardcore and poppier forms of punk rock like the Ramones. Early emocore, an early form of post-hardcore and melodic hardcore, was basically just more emotionally expressive, sad melodic hardcore with slightly atypical riffing, like Rites of Spring and Dag Nasty. But it was one of the first forms of melodic hardcore alongside bands like the Descendants and Bad Religion which had nothing to do with emo. So while most later emocore bands leaned  into the post-hardcore by emphasizing elements like the atypical riffs, and elements of noise rock/post-punk and \"math rock\" (Indian summer and stuff) others were simply melodic hardcore bands taking influence from those emocore bands.\n\n\nLifetime and d.b.s. are emo influenced melodic hardcore/slate punk. In the modern days there's bands like Hot Water Music and later Title Fight. Small Brown Bike was post-hardcore that sounds closer to regular punk stuff. Even something as big as The Wonder Years, Alkaline Trioor the Menzingers has some light emo vibes. This is all because emo pop and pop punk mixed together at some point into something that people simply called pop punk. \nCertain  Features people associate with pop punk are actually from emo. Something similar happened when \"easy core\" became popular ( a mix of more commercial pop punk and melodic metalcore) which made people associate metallic, metalcore esque riffs but happier with pop punk even though they didn't really come from pop punk. \n\nIf you want to compare, something like Motion City Soundtrack is one of these hybrids, while something like Green Day is purely Pop Punk (more in line with ramones influenced stuff like Screeching Weasel), and Blink 182 Skate Punk/Pop Punk (more in line with melodic hardcore on the faster songs). \n\nWhen these people say \"emo\" they either mean \"Commercialized Emo Pop/Pop Punk/modern post-hardcore/Melodic Metalcore Hybrids\" sound wise or they mean \"Mainstream Scene Kid subculture that grew out of forms of emo/post-hardcore, sass and metalcore but quickly split off\". There were \"emo\" bands that had little to do with pop punk and more with modernized/commercial post-hardcore and melodic metalcore that were called emo, for example.\n\nListen to something like Jimmy Eat World, The Get Up Kids or the Promise Ring. That's Emo Pop, which grew out of 90's midwest emo like Sunny Day Real Estate or the Appleseed Cast. Their instrumentals and vocal styles are not just inspired by punk but also by indie and post-hardcore, and they came from those 90's emo subcultures that was something in between emo/punk and indie subcultures.\n\nAt some point you had bands like Saves the Day, Fall Out Boy, Taking Back Sunday and My Chemical Romance that intentional or not were kind of in between emo pop and pop punk/Skate punk.  At some point bands that had nothing to do with punk or emo scenes \nand more commercial versions started to pop up. \n(note that sound wise mcr and fall out boy came from metalcore/hardcore, not emo, even though they popularized the scene kid look along with a metalcore band eighteen visions which came from \"sassy\" post-hardcore/screamo like Swing kids or orchid which the dude from fall out noy digged if I remember correctly) \n\nFrom some point forwards emo pop and pop punk simply became synonimous and many pop punk bands, regardless of whether they were scene kid related or more from actual punk, mainstream or underground, were more likely to have elements of both. But there's still a great difference between something like Hawthorne Heights and something like I don't know, Neck Deep. The first is emo pop/modern post-hardcore, the second is more commerically friendly pop punk/skate punk. If you want to compare old stuff, take the twee pop/indie related \"Everyone asked about you\" as emo pop from 90s Midwest emo, while pop punk was more something like The Queers or maybe Rancid, or the more pop punk style songs by skate punk and ska punk bands. In the older days, most 'emo pop\" bands either were emo influenced indie or came from emo and hardcore/punk backgrounds, but later they were more just from scene kid backgorunds. Some of the mainstream commercial ones even came more from pop or unrelated backgrounds with an emo influence.", "created_utc": "1655883294.0", "edited": "1655960635.0", "id": "ida2fgd", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_vhooxa", "parent_id": "t1_id8u8tg", "score": "13", "subreddit": "LetsTalkMusic", "subreddit_id": "t5_2t4it"}, {"author": "DIYDylana", "body": "It's likely a symptom of something commomly corelated in people with autism like depression or stress, not autism itself.", "created_utc": "1655882086.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ida0zis", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_vhqsbu", "parent_id": "t1_id8w6ec", "score": "5", "subreddit": "aspergers", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rm6u"}, {"author": "DIYDylana", "body": "Brain fog is an incredibly commom basic symptom for lots of conditions, including depression, stress/anxeity, sleep problems, eating problems, med side effects, injuries on the head, etc, which are things a lot of autistic people are more likely to deal with.

Yes you are changing sex characteristics. But you are not becoming the opposite sex, you're something in between. You're just close enough to it where for social perception purposes it shouldn't really be a deal breaker to consider it a variation on the same thing.\n\nSecond, the gender you have in soceity can definitely change. It alters the way people percieve you and may alter the way people treat you depending on that soceity. You can also change the way you label your gender or the perception of your gender (asin later realizing you are  a woman or a man).  You simply do not change your internal sense of gender, or well, for all I know it might be possible in some circumstances, but typically that internal, more neurological sense of gender was always there. We don't understand this aspect all that well yet, but it seems to be a thing.  Gender identity isn't purely social, it has both more neurological layers and more social layers. \n\nThird, just because something is a social construct doesn't mean it's meaningless, nor that it's completely arbitrary nor that it makes sense to change it to anything. The typical example is money. We ascribe its value or what system we use. It's an intangible, semi arbitrary, human, social element that we can easily change, though it heavily impacts peoples lives and there's still valid reasons we have it. it is also a fact of reality that some form of trading under humans is a natural consequence of humans their situation. \n\nThe same could be said for purely social aspects of gender identity, they initially come from how we deal with our perceptions of sex and the associations made with them through patterns and interpretations of them. \n\nAlso the term social construct has been heavily abused. I don't even know how sociologists and anthropologists use it but I doubt most of the people using it online do either. There's a huge difference between categories and concepts we socially decide the lines between based on natural things that exist, and purely social phenomenon.  So for example, the strict definition of a tomato is a social construct. The names and categories of what does and doesn't count as a tomato is a social construct (hence some think it's a vegetable when it's really a fruit). The line between where green ends and blue starts is a social construct. But the concepts themselves they are reffering to aren't. They are tabgible existing things that have nothing to do with social interactions or soceity. A tomato is gonna do its thing regardless of what we do. Well, the thing is that gender identity is going to exist regardless of what we do. It's just the social elements of it, like gender expression, gender roles, associating yourself with other people of your gender, labeling yourself, etc that you can change. That doesn't make it meaningless either, but yeah, that part is indeed social. \n\nThe internal sense of gender identity however doesn't seem to be, otherwise it wouldn't be the case that most trans people who physically transition into their actual gender alleviate their dysphoria. Otherwise there wouldn't be trans people who could feel their real gender from an early age.

It's just typically not called gender dysphoria as that's specifically been used for treating trans people.\n\nThe people saying it's dysmorphia, I disagree with because dysmorphia is about a psychologically warped perception while dysphoria is about discomfort and incongruence with physical reality. As far as I was told, If you'd make a person with body dysmorphia get the body they want, they still wouldn't be satisfied because the issue is mental, not physical, they'd never see it as enough. With dysphoria when you treat it, it's actually alleviated most of the time.\n\nIn the sense in the opening post, Body image issues would have more to do with self esteem and how soceity views them. Here there's nothing actually inconguent about their gender identity and their physique they just don't like something or feel too judged by something. This is far more common in cis people than dysphoria, due to unrealistic expectations placed upon people, and women often being judged for their looks. Especially people who have traits that arent typically seen in that gender.

I can vaguely remember certain actions their feel too, but rarely any words whatsoever. Agains, everything including visuals is vague, because it's more an approximation based on my \"feels\", except for things I touched. I remember touch well, probably because my sight is pretty bad.

I can definitely not relive them or remember details I often just remember things like \"I felt like shit that day\".\n\nWhat is weird though is that if I have a conversation with someone they can trigger my memory in ways where I do recognize they told me a certain thing, especially if it's been repeated before, so inside jokes and stuff often end up working fine, I just won't associate that ir was said before with a specific memory I just know that I recognize it. I just will not be able to map it to a specific memory. Im general if someone gives their opinions on something I'm much more likely to remember whether the opinion was positive or negative, the general conclusion/gist/point, and how I felt about it than what the actual arguments/specifics were. A lot of my memories just kind of store certain info and feeling with a certain theme, so I may not remember any of the conversations with a particular friend, but I slowly accumulate facts about that friends and a certain opinion on how I feel about them if I think about them, which are then often triggered by something else.

I am not a Japanese person, I don't get a bajillion amounts of exposure in my day to day life, so I'm prone to confusing them. For the sake of more consistency, I based it on which words are written with the same modern kana, but not all of those words are actually pronounced the same in modern Japanese either and some are written differently but pronounced the same. Now, I didn't really want to go list all the little differences in allophones (They register as mostly the same to Japanese people), but what was easy to do was look at how the pitch accents differed in the standard dialect. That means that IN that dialect, they aren't truly homophones, because well, they don't sound the same even to Japanese people, they just recognize which word it's supposed to be from context. However if you disregard pitch accent, they would sound the same. Identifying the pitch accents allows people to list only these ''true'' homophones and ''All'' homophones if they so desire, as long as it's about \u6a19\u6e96\u8a9e\u3002\n\nAs for pitch accent..\n\n1: Pitch accent shows the most variation between dialects. I fail to see how this is a counter argument against paying attention to it. People usually learn \u6a19\u6e96\u8a9e and \u6771\u4eac\u5f01, so why wouldn't you try to mimic the way people speak those dialects?. 1 dialect has a consistent range of ways of speaking that differs from another dialect, not the inconsistent way I speak. There's some ''separate'' languages that are way closer to the concept of a dialect, I'm mostly trying to learn a particular version of the language. This is like saying that just because americans spell it like color and british people spell it as colour that I shouldn't pay attention to the spelling. Or hell, that just because american english and british english are pronounced differently and everyone has an accent, that I shouldn't try to pronounce things better. Don't people try to pronounce things as well as they can all the time? Imagine if Japanese people never even tried to pronounce english sounds in the english way and always katakanized every sentence. Can I understand them? Sure but why would I shit on anyone trying to do better? Why is there this arbitrary line to stop at pitch accent?\n\n2: Same as the first.\n\n3: I don't think the goal of studying pitch accent or at least being aware of it is to differentiate words, the context is what will work. Though I do think it can make it a bit easier on the ears, considering that when peoPLE talk TO me with wildLY difFErent stress accENT It actually costs me more effort to parse and leads me to misshear some individual words. ts lk hw I cn tpe laik dis n peple may undrstnd.\n\n4: I don't see why that's relevant, nor do people often act like it is a big deal.\n\n5: Dogen always made sure to tell to not be overly concious about it or else it will sound more unnatural. That's why you shouldn't always conciously try to speak with the right pitch accent. You learn the general rules, train awareness, memorize some big exceptions, and then when you speak you just try to speak without thinking much about it. I've rarely seen people who come from a language without an emphasis on pitch  who pick it up naturally without any kind of pitch access awareness training or being told its relevant. The characteristic will often seem as irrelevant as whether something is aspirated or not in English and their pitch accent ends up inconsistent.  It's actually been very similar to me as my voice feminization training, I started conciously raising my larynx, moving my tongue position, etc, but often when I do it I overdo it and strain and sound unnatural. If I did it ''naturally'' from the start, it wouldn't work. But once I practiced a lot to get the muscle memory, now when I just talk, the things I learned kind of come automatically, without the unnatural strain.\n\nNow, I am not at all someone that pays a ton of attention to pitch accent all the time. I'm not trying to be perfect. But I do think it's good that people are made more aware of it, it's better than the past where people acted like it didn't exist. If people want to study it, people want to study it. Personally I love learning to read the readings of some obscure kanji I really don't need to memorize I came accross. I like learning how to write kanji I don't need to write. I like to learn obscure kunyomi readings.

I think that's a skewed way to deal with things, it should be about fighting sexism and inequality in general, and being aware of intersectional things and imbalances/context during. If my focus goes on women's issues, it's just because there's more severe sexism there to deal with, but at the end of the day, the goal would be to fight sexism and inequality. Patriarchy is a symptom of sexism that fucks over everyone except maybe the top percentage of men, which those feminists claim to agree with, but their actions to me seem to show otherwise. Individual sexism should also not be ignored. Everything is interpereted as a thing against women. Men suffer from something? Well it's actually because of misoginy, and women are suffering more from it. Somehow. Hell even when men have a systemic issue, it's often treated as a personal one, and it's often seen as something that is wrong with them. Victim Blaming goes both ways folk.\n\nI totally feel you, when feminists and progressives do it, it stings WAY more to me. They're supposed to be the better ones, they're supposed to be the allies, it's supposed to be the place where I can go to for support. Their beliefs and the things they actually say/do don't match up, it's disappointing and frustrating, and I totally agree with you on the concistency thing. I find cishet neurotypical culture hard to understand and filled with problems (at least the one I'm familiar with) BUT if you're consistent with it, at least there's no hypocricy. It becomes a consentual thing where both parties have their requirments. But that particular brand of feminist are just well, super hypocritical. . They prepetuate gender role stereotypes, but when they do it, it's suddenly not sexism, and when I generalize them, suddenly it's inherently a problem.\n\nTwo wrongs don't make a right amigo, especially when you're dealing with individuals who didn't choose to be in a group you're genaralizing in which privelage is very situation and person dependant.. Focusing on your own group is totally fine especially if it's the group with the imbalance, but you can't only be against sexism and rigid gender roles when it's in your favor or convenient to you, and then when you're called out for prepetuating it, cry ''misogynist''. Men ARE hurt by these things. Cis men, trans men, and even trans women and non binary people.\n\nThat only makes people want to move away from your cause, I mean shitting on men in an activist context (not a venting one where you clarify its not an essential thing), it's not exactly encouraging people to help you. Acting like their problems don't exist also makes it harder for them to take women's problems seriously, and trust me, I want women's problems to be taken seriously. When there's no space for people to talk about men's issues without being talked down on because women have it worse overall, then obviously they're going to go to toxic spaces. Where else are they accepted? Even a space like Men's lib I see people holding back in to not upset feminists too much. Things have to be phrased in a way feminists are happy with, or else it gets heated or even removed. And it's weird because it's often the same kind of person that goes ''if you're for gender equality, you're already a feminist'', which makes little sense.\n\nThey want to somehow hold a monopoly on what's ethical and right and everyone who has a little critical thought is somehow bad. People are often then afraid to bother that loud vocal minority and so they either parrot what they say or stay quiet.\n\nI had a whole anti-feminist phase but I quickly noticed that anti-feminists and ''anti sjw's'' were very full of shit and did the exact same bs they complained about the other group of doing and then target low hanging fruit vocal minorities and straw man paint the whole feminist movement as just that. As it went on, more and more non-left people joined in on it and it became a huge mess. I was young and impresisonable too so that didn't help.\n\nWe have to indeed remember that these people don't represent all of feminism and that loud annoying voices are typical when it comes to big movements, We shouldn't let them cloud the usefullness of feminism and fighting for gender equality in general, though the fact that the spaces become uncomfortable is just sad. I don't really identify as a feminist because I'm not an activist in any sense (I already have way too many personal problems), but I support feminism overall and I won't let these people take that away from me, feminism has done a lot of good for this world. Just because they're wrong doesn't mean the opposite is right. It's the same with how I've seen  some extreme online left people who were insane and awful and who would try to say my views are not ''really left'' because of my criticisism but I refuse to let other people dictate my values.

Cishet culture is just really weird in general. Sometimes I feel like despite how far we've progressed, dating dynamics are stuck in the 50's or something. Dating as a man is filled with weird double standards and expectations of  average straight women, yet if you critisize any of it, you're often either told to suck it up or you get told it's not real and that maybe it''s even just your fault, by both the left and the right, even feminists sometimes, or you might even get called misogynistic.  I've seen people shit fully on men only to go ''but not trans men'' asif its progressive wtf. Then when you get bitter they make a lot of assumptions about you that aren't even true. The way the left has acted about men has been very bad for my upbringing and only made me double down into toxic spaces I regret going into when I was young and impressionable. Those bad spaces are right in that there is a problem people aren' willing to admit to, but completely wrong in their observations and conclusions on said problem, and are filled with toxic alt right bullshit.\n\nEveryone contributes to sexism in some way towards women AND men, people internalize that culture. The modern western male gender role wasn't a privilege to me in anything but safety (I mean, I can't even hold a job anyways I'm on disability), I fucking despise that role just as much as the bullshit in the cishet female one. In fact, while I'm over it now, It actually hurt me to the core at some point.\n\nThe thing is I always supported the women around me for the bullshit they had to deal with, I tried to empathize, yet, they never tried to empathize with whatever was bothering me about the social expectations and perceptions of being a man at all, or how soceity contributed to the mistakes I made, not just my own immaturity. It was asif I was speaking an alien language (edit: kinda like when women show this clearly existing problem yet a bunch of cis men seem to refuse to even remotely fathom that it happens). Yet, For most social problems I could name for women, I could name the mirror version for men, and they keep eachother in check. There's a reason either side keeps behaving in the ways they do. Just because men overall are the ones oppressing women, doesn't suddenly make the sexism towards them less relevant, especially not as individuals. That's like saying just because we have systemic racism from white against black in this culture that black people like me can't be racist towards anyone ever. Is it as big of a deal in context? Probably not, but it's still wrong, and whatever happened to fighting for small issue being okay too?

I was sometimes teased by the more ''normal'' people boys and girls, but somehow I've managed to not really get bullied while a lot of people I know with similar personalities did, I was kind of just left alone as ''that weird dude that talks too much about random shit''. Anyways, What I was trying to say is that I wasn't seen as ''one of those guys'' more easily (the guys I was afraid of being perceived as), but I wasn't seen as ''one of the girls'', even if occasionally they'' invite me along to something or liked my company.

I started with wondering whether I'm non binary, but I've concluded that I just want to be a woman, but my own version of woman. I don't think not socially fitting in that well when I literally have a mental condition that effects social conformity should dictate how woman or not woman I am ya know. I used to want to distance mysef from it all, but now I just want to feel included without necessarily feeling like I need to conform to do so.\n\nedit: As a ''dude'' I was just..atypical. Not necessarily feminine. Just not masculine, though definitely more familiar with and fluent in guy ''culture'' so to speak, though I was also more comfy with ''girl culture'' due to always being with my mom and sis. Growing up as a ''dude'' well, for the longest time I didn't really express myself that much as my own person. I didn't really feel comfortable enough with my sense of self and I didn't want to stand out. I mostly just observed people and created things and overanalyzed things from a rationalized perspective rather than a participant one. I never really explored the full range of things, didn't really understand my desires, and quickly felt embarrassed and shamed. Appearantly little kid me wanted to paint my nails with mom and sis but my mom said my uncle reacted weird to it because I was a guy and so I never did it again. I have no recollection of this or even wanting to ever paint my nails, yet something about me is in this repressed kind of neutralized state where I never really dared venture into femininity cause I thought it just ''wasn't for me''. Now I learned I love dresses and stuff, but that's because I had a reason to explore myself since questioning.", "created_utc": "1653236066.0", "edited": "1653236663.0", "id": "i9kt0w6", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_uv6p9i", "parent_id": "t1_i9kpdxn", "score": "5", "subreddit": "asktransgender", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r4b9"}, {"author": "DIYDylana", "body": "(Whoops this reply turned out to be longer and more off topic than expected sorry)\n\nAs much as being a quote unquote ''man'' in society is generally a privilege, That's one of the downsides of being a'man''. You're more likely to be perceived as some kind of threat or bother by default because people can't really tell from the start whether you're one of the safe or considerate ones, and all the gender roles associated with men. You kind of have to prove yourself. This is even worse if you look very unconventional,  a way that could initially be read as strong and intimidating or are socially awkward. Ofcourse that's not as bad as being the one worrying about being in danger, but it doesn't mean it can't bother someone.\n\nAs a kind of softy autistic nerd, I've always hated toxic masculinity long before I was aware of the term. I was raised mostly by my mom and sis and they complained about men and sexism a lot but said I would be different so I felt fear and a huge pressure to not bother women. Ironically it lead me into bothering women in other ways for a while,, but I digress, at some point a lot of girls and non transitioned afabs told me they were more at ease with me than most dudes.  The problem is that I have massive ''pure-o'' ocd intrusive thoughts and anxiety issues and am also quite a horndog (especially because I use it to escape from my depression) so the guilt often stays to some degree even though rationally I know I'm fine, I've always been respectful about it.\n\nI still wonder whether my questioning is just internalized misandry (Asin the ''feeling guilty to be a man'' and the ''Not relating to toxic masculinity'' kind) and a lot of other possible things.\n\nThat said, I feel like even just now questioning, the mere fact that I want to be a girl and wear dresses combined with me being more at ease with myself, has made women talk to me on a much less closed off, cold  level right when I met them.

As it faded, I felt better. I felt more content. Less Anxious. More enegetic. Like I could actually change things around.  Like the weight of the negative depressed feelings wasn't dragging me down as much. I didn't feel cured of my depression or whatever, but what I mean to say is that it helped. But I didn't notice that the happiness I felt was decreased too, it decreased a little bit of everyhing. It was an alright balance though, given that I was over emotional prior. This was a tiny little test dosage. It was basically the perfect amount, my only issue was that I couldn't cry as well and I had some stomach cramps. \n\nThe moment they upped the dosage, Everything went wrong, the numbing effect went too far this time. I felt like an absolute zombie, and disconnected from my sense of self. Went from over emotional to being unable to cry much at all even though I've been going through worse things than when I was young like losing my eye. Theree were no highs, no lows. Not a lick of motivation. Just numbness. I got scared and stopped cold turkey. (Note that they then lowered it, and the moment they upped it again, I quit cold turkey a second time. Dumb, I know). \ni had a horrible withdrawal period, it was awful. Then I just kept feeling emotionally blunted, but a huge amount of brain fog/cognitive issues and a chaotic mind was added. I already had some sexual issues that I didn't have when I was even younger (to be fair, I was also on epilepsy meds  for a while when I was younger), but now my low sensitivity down there turned to nothingness and my orgasms from low into nothingness. Libido remained similar, mental excitement remained similar, no erectile dysfunction, which is why I could still masturbate.  As time went on, after about 3 years feelings of numbness ans brainfog lessened. The weird thing is that I can still behave emotionally and can even react to it physically, I know that technically It's how I feel deep down but I don't feel it, so I seem less like a zombie than I am. For example I can have anxious tought patterns and behavior, but not feel the anxeity within me (it used to be a really strong feeling instead). But sill, the symptoms remain.

The thing is that it's often a reflection and snapshot of how someone felt the moment they wrote something or at least a reflection of the type of things they were interested in.
