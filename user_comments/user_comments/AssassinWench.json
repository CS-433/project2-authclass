He invited some work friends and a bunch of his friend from out of work to his house.\n\nOne of the invited people was Pilar (f32) who was drop dead geagours and since I recently became single, I wanted to try my best,\n\nRob is French but he went to a bilingual school as a child. He has a tiny bit of accent when speaking English but most people don\u2019t notice. I am aware how much effort it takes to learn another language, I took a year of French and I can only say \u201cVoulez-vous coucher avec moi, ce soir?\u201d\n\nI heard Pilar speak but I couldn\u2019t pinpoint where she was from and assumed that she was from Canada (she had a weird mix of American and British accents). Turns out that no, she\u2019s not from there but from Sweden.\n\nShe was outside with someone and I overheard them asking Pilar how learning Arabic was going.\n\n\u2018it\u2019s slow, it\u2019s much harder than other languages I learned,\u2019  she replied.\n\nI joined their conversation and asked \u2018what other languages do you speak?\u2019\n\n\u2018Swedish, French and Spanish,\u2019 she replied.\n\n\u2018how did you learn them?\u2019 I  asked.\n\n\u2018I had French and English at school and I studied Spanish at uni.\u2019\n\n\u2018Are you fluent in all of them\u2019 and she confirmed that yes.\n\nIt\u2019s truly impressive when people speak multiple languages fluently but I find it hard to believe that she did when in the good ol\u2019 America (I am originally from TX) we have people who move as children and never become fluent.\n\nI didn\u2019t want to call her out and risk my chances (did I said she was stunning?) so I figured a small game of testing her skill would be a fun way to do so.\n\nSo I asked \u2018can you tell me what this word is in other languages?\u2019 And she did (I used a translator to check). I did a few and se was correct but those were easy words. I decided to raise the bar and go for more complex word such as Aquarius, Cheeseweed, Armadillo. She know a word in English but not in Spanish or she would know it in French but not in Swedish (how\u2019s that possible).\n\nThis was surprising as if you\u2019re fluent you should know these words in all languages, am I right?\n\nSo I asked, \u2018are you really fluent? If you were, you would know these words.\u2019\n\nShe replied \u2018Yes. I didn\u2019t know some in Swedish, does that mean I ma not fluent in my mother tongue?\u2019\n\nI tried to explain myself be she ignored me and left and went over to Rob. I could hear hear saying something in French and Rob looked angry. He came over and said, \u2018stop making people uncomfortable or I\u2019ll kick you out.\u2019\n\nI tried to defend myself and say I did nothing wrong and she\u2019s the liar but he wouldn\u2019t listen to me.\n\nPilar ignored me for the rest of the night and I think I blew it.\n\nRob messaged me on Sunday to tell me I was way out of line and I still don\u2019t know what I did wrong. If she\u2019s nothing to hide, why would she get angry? Was I the asshole or was she?", "created_utc": "1666783503.0", "edited": "1666784884.0", "id": "itubulk", "is_submitter": "True", "link_id": "t3_ydvmib", "parent_id": "t3_ydvmib", "score": "0", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "AssassinWench", "body": "This pisses me off as an avid language learner \ud83d\ude21", "created_utc": "1666780291.0", "edited": "False", "id": "itu790b", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_yddt6q", "parent_id": "t3_yddt6q", "score": "1", "subreddit": "AmITheDevil", "subreddit_id": "t5_27t6v0"}, {"author": "AssassinWench", "body": "100% agree!

The title of the post gave me the impression that no discussion could change your mind, but I'm glad that isn't the case and hopefully everyone in this comment section can keep an open mind.\n \nWhen it comes to what you said about why didn't JC give him love and compassion back, I think this really stems from the fact that he views WWX's existence as part of the reason he is often viewed as unimpressive and less than. Honestly I don't think that this notion is incorrect since we see that for example, WWX is a stronger cultivator as well as archer compared to JC - but - that being said, it isn't WWX's fault that he is the way that he is and JC blaming him for that is completely in the wrong. \n\nAnd I agree WWX shouldn't have to be the one always trying to/doing the right thing and being the bigger person. (And I also imagine he acts this way because he feels indebted to his adoptive family). \n\nBut when it comes to WWX's intent, it doesn't matter (apart from solidifying his own character), since insecurity can't or at least shouldn't be fixed through external means. As cliche as it sounds, it has to come from within. Plus once he feels that WWX has betrayed him and the family <!while unaware that his core was not \"restored\" but given!> I think he views the idea of being the Twin Prides as an empty promise and not genuine which only makes him sour more. That's why I love when he finds out about WWX's sacrifice for him. Because that is when his worldview shatters and he has to genuinely look back on his life and his choices, as an adult, and come to terms with his mistakes and finally start to grow. I actually like how it worked out in the show because the show doesn't try to make JC suddenly redeemed or \"in the right\" since, like he has felt his whole life, he isn't the main character, WWX is. And since it's his story, we are following it to it's rightful conclusion, and not following JC's to his. \n\nOh and just to add because I forgot to address it up top. I think that JC's upbringing unfortunately makes him extremely obedient to those viewed as authority figures especially after he is put in charge of Lotus Pier and has to deal with people viewing his as an insufficient leader due to WWX's actions. And it doesn't help that WWX won't tell anybody including JC, why he isn't using his sword. (Of course we the audience know why, but from JC's perspective, and with no information on what happened during those three months, he sees his behavior as unwarranted.)\n\nWWX thinks, I don't care if MY reputation is tarnished because I am protecting my loved ones. From JC's POV though, and this in a way seems more aligned with collectivist society values, WWX's reputation is tied to the family's reputation. So he views this as another transgression against him and the family since he is kept in the dark for the majority of the show as to the \"why\". \n\n(And once again I just want to reiterate that I'm referring to The Untamed's JC and not Grandmaster's especially since the reconciliation or lack of seem to be quite different between the two. I know OP knows this since I stated it earlier, but just in case anyone else is reading through this thread I just wanted that distinction to be made). \n\nI also find Meng Yao and Nie Huaisang to be extremely interesting characters like Jiang Cheng \ud83d\ude0a\n\nAlso I'm heading to bed now, but I will hopefully find some time in the morning to read your response and follow up.", "created_utc": "1657953730.0", "edited": "1658008957.0", "id": "igd6cc8", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_w05eul", "parent_id": "t1_igd2o9a", "score": "1", "subreddit": "MoDaoZuShi", "subreddit_id": "t5_qg5fl"}, {"author": "AssassinWench", "body": "I agree that everyone has to take accountability at some point, 100%. I do also agree however with another commenter though who emphasized how basically the circumstances they go through i.e. just the plot are what in some way force JC and WWX into who they are by the end as well as explain why they couldn't maintain their already shaky relationship. \n\nI'm going to try to go down your questions one by one.\n\nWhen it comes to the Twin Prides, it seemed to me that WWX came up with and envisioned this future of them as the Twin Prides because (1) he didn't plan for his life to go the way that it did \ud83d\ude2d and (2) almost as a way to try to make JC not feel so insecure and reassure him that he isn't trying to overshadow him. I think it's pretty clear that JC was never confident in himself or the idea of being the Twin Prides but he would never admit this. And I think this ide of being the Twin Prides only becomes a sore spot for him when he feels that is being abandoned/betrayed. \n\nThis kinda leads into my answer for your next question. \n\nAs for why JC wouldn't have confided in his brother, I think it goes back to his upbringing. From what I gathered, he grew up viewing that sort of behavior (emotional intelligence) as weakness in comparison to physical strength which I think is also highlighted by Zidian, that he got from his mum, who I think is to blame for raising him with this sort of mindset. And as I mentioned earlier, the lack of emotional intelligence also makes sense at the beginning due to their ages at the start of the story. No one expects a pubescent child to have the emotional intelligence required to grapple with most of the things that WWX and JC go through in the story. It's just that people are different and find different ways to survive and I think that WWX and JC both were doing that in their own ways whether right or wrong and were both being led by their own convictions. Also since I brought on convictions (and I don't know where else to put this sentence), I think that WWX so perfectly encapsulating the family's motto, while a great credit to him, only adds to JC's own insecurity.\n\nRegarding your last statement about family, I think JC also views putting family first, but, and this is a big but, he sees WWX as the one who betrayed their family first whether true or not.\n\nThe situation really sucks because, and maybe this is just wishful thinking, if JC had had a better upbringing he might not have reacted so poorly and >!lost his golden core!< which I consider to be the driving force for the rest of the show. It also doesn't help that >!losing his golden core!< makes him lose hope in any future as he would be losing yet another thing that would make him feel lesser compared to WWX both physically and emotionally.\n\n(Also as a complete aside, have you seen/do you like Hamilton? I remember I saw an edit on YouTube of JC and WWX with \"Wait For It\" and it not only fits perfectly, but explains why I find JC to be such an interesting character like I do Aaron Burr)\n\nAlso I apologize in advance for the wordiness \u7b11\u7b11", "created_utc": "1657949811.0", "edited": "False", "id": "igd0m3v", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_w05eul", "parent_id": "t1_igcx9l1", "score": "2", "subreddit": "MoDaoZuShi", "subreddit_id": "t5_qg5fl"}, {"author": "AssassinWench", "body": "I am an only child so I was curious if you were looking at it from the angle of someone who didn't grow up with other children within the home. \n\nPersonally, and I will go based on the Untamed not Grandmaster as I haven't finished the novel(s) yet, I felt like the set up for JC acting harshly towards WWX as they were growing up is due to how he was treated/how he perceived he was treated by his parents and others comparing the two of them as they were growing up. \n\nWWX is in no way at fault for any of these things, but it makes sense for JC in the beginning to behave the way he did due to what I just previously mentioned plus their age (maturity level). If WWX weren't there he wouldn't feel inadequate at least within his own family/sect (not to mention WWX not even being a blood relative). I am only about 7 years older than my youngest coworker and I can't emphasize the differences between us, let alone if they were as young as WWX and JC at Gusu in the beginning of the story as well as in the flashbacks.

Especially when I am trying to make the point that economic power \u2260 happiness.....\n\nI have already said that I agree that the happiness is ridiculously subjective and hard to measure, but there are factors that go into improving happiness of individuals and groups that can be measured. Since you can't measure happiness as a subjective construct, you set up parameters that are quantitative and can be measured. That is a large part of the field of psychology.  The following link is to a Honors Thesis that I found really interesting that looks into the connection between money and happiness for example.\n\nhttps://digitalcommons.bryant.edu/honors_appliedpsychology/7/\n\nIt seems that (obviously) not having enough money has a negative impact on happiness/perception of happiness whereas once you reach a certain threshold far above meeting your needs it doesn't improve and sometimes seems to lead to a decrease in happiness/perception of happiness. \n\nAlso it seems like you may have not understood what I was claiming about Japan so I will explain what was being stated in the sources I used. \n\n\"Depression\" is uncommon in Japan because of a social stigma that prevents people from getting diagnosed and therefore not being included in official numbers that are recorded...... not because it doesn't exist..... That's why it's no shock that the suicide rate is so high. (Trust me, I'm not ignorant when it comes to Japan, but that is why I included outside information and didn't try to make my claim anecdotal.)\n\nThat also seems to be the case in South Korea that has one of the highest suicide rates in the world unfortunately. For countries with a more open approach to mental health, and a robust mental health support system cases will be higher, but can then be better treated. \n\nOnce again, thank you for no sources of any kind. If my data is such BS, you must find for example the WHO to be unreliable as that is where the data was pulled for the mental health statistics. \n\nIf you don't agree on the parameters used in these studies then that is completely fine and we can agree to disagree, but so far you have only come back with snarky comments and no sources of any kind, simply anecdote. \n\nI understand you don't believe there is any way we can measure happiness or factors of it, but surely there are sources that you could point to, to break down some of the points included for example depression rates being high in some of the top countries. \n\nI included information showing that the depression rates are not as high in for example some of the highest rated countries on the list (the Nordic countries) with WHO-based evidence and you find it BS. Please provide your evidence to the contrary.\n\nIf you're not going to reply with any sources, then this conversation isn't going anywhere and we should stop wasting each other's time. \n\nI'm not really sure what your goal is with this conversation, so maybe it's better to not engage with someone who doesn't actually read or break down any of information I provide and is simply submitting to confirmation bias. \n\nWhether you reply or not, I hope that you have a good day, a good life, and that even if your country of Taiwan is not happy (by your standard) that you and your loved ones live happy and fulfilled lives.", "created_utc": "1653096509.0", "edited": "False", "id": "i9eflhy", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_usza75", "parent_id": "t1_i9ebz5p", "score": "1", "subreddit": "China", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh2v"}, {"author": "AssassinWench", "body": "Me too \ud83d\ude05 I had a trip scheduled in May 2020 haha so I'm just (a little less than) patiently waiting to reschedule ATM", "created_utc": "1653067820.0", "edited": "False", "id": "i9crmp2", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_usza75", "parent_id": "t1_i9cqloo", "score": "2", "subreddit": "China", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh2v"}, {"author": "AssassinWench", "body": "I mean definitely a lot of factors go into it, so if you're happy living in Shanghai that's awesome!

Depression is much more likely to be diagnosed in highly developed countries, whose more robust health care infrastructures are far better equipped to identify and treat mental illnesses.\n\nTherefore, less developed countries do not necessarily have less depression\u2014rather, their treatment of mental illnesses often takes a back seat to broader concerns such as hunger, disease, and sanitation. In fact, the World Health Organization estimates that 76\u201385% of people suffering from mental disorders in low- and middle-income countries lack access to the necessary treatment. Moreover, even in developed nations, many cases of mental illness go undiagnosed and unreported because the patients are either ashamed of their illness or unaware that it's a medically treatable condition.\n\nDepression rates are rising around the world, but it's likely that this rise is due at least in part to a good thing: More patients than ever before are seeking and receiving treatment for mental illness rather than going undiagnosed. In many countries, including the United States, the stigma surrounding mental illnesses is gradually decreasing. This enables a more open discussion of mental illness and makes people more likely to seek help when they need it.\n\nA nation\u2019s culture can also have a significant impact on both the mental health of its population and the availability of mental health treatment services. Additionally, certain symptoms of depression are more common in some societies than others due to cultural factors. For example, while depression is relatively uncommon in Japan, suicide rates are high for children and teens ages 10-19. This is most likely due to pressure to do well in school and work and conform to group norms.\"\n\nWith Source Cited:\n\nhttps://www.who.int/publications-detail-redirect/depression-global-health-estimates\n\nSorry to bombard you with information but I wanted to show that I'm not pulling information from nowhere.", "created_utc": "1653060973.0", "edited": "False", "id": "i9cabcq", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_usza75", "parent_id": "t1_i9atj9m", "score": "1", "subreddit": "China", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh2v"}, {"author": "AssassinWench", "body": "Also I wanted to provide this information that I found as well:\n\nhttps://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/suicide-rate-by-country\n\n\"Suicide in Sweden\nIn 2019, Sweden had 14.7 suicides per 100,000 people. Historically, Sweden has had a high suicide rate, with the most suicides in the developed world during the 1960s. That may have been due, at least in part, to cultural attitudes regarding suicide and long, dark winters, particularly in the northern regions. The government responded to the crisis with social welfare and mental health services, and the numbers have dropped dramatically. Today, Scandinavian countries \u2013 Norway, Sweden, Denmark, and Finland \u2013 have very high happiness rates and relatively low suicide rates. However, the dark winters \u2013 20 hours of darkness or more in each day in some areas \u2013 causes seasonal affective disorder (SAD), a form of depression, which has been known to correlate with higher rates of suicide.\"\n\n\"Suicide in China\nIn China, suicide is the fifth leading cause of death and accounts for over one-quarter of suicides worldwide. In contrast with many Western countries, in which men are more likely to commit suicide, most suicide victims in China are women. China's economic boom has led to greater independence for women, who are now much more able to get divorced as a means of dealing with domestic violence. However, the strain of divorce means that they must work long hours while raising their children, often without family support that the culture has traditionally relied on in the past.\n\nWhen women show the strain of their stressful lives and are admitted to a hospital for psychiatric care, they are likely to be discharged much sooner than their male counterparts. They feel that they need to return to their jobs and families as quickly as possible, even if they are not ready to do so. Additionally, many insurances do not cover hospital stays in cases of attempted suicide. These strains have exacerbated suicide among Chinese women. People in rural parts of China are five times more likely to commit suicide than people in cities. This notion may be attributed to a lack of mental healthcare, the stigma associated with mental illnesses (such as schizophrenia), poverty, and poor education. However, exact statistics are hard to come by because the Chinese government has carried out few to no epidemiological studies on suicide. Most suicide attempts in China are carried out with a pesticide or other poison.\"\n\nHere are the sources cited to back up this information: \n\nhttps://apps.who.int/gho/data/node.main.MHSUICIDE\n\nhttps://apps.who.int/gho/data/node.sdg.3-4-data?lang=en\n\nThis original link also provides information about South Korea and Japan which as you're probably well aware have very high suicide rates too.
