But you pretty much contradicted yourself saying we should just let it happen and now you say we can intervene, of course we can, and I think that's mostly what I thought about when writing the bit about tiny communes (mostly eco-sociallists in nature) that are all around the globe, wish they could maybe start spreading and organizing to help or inform outsiders to get a more homogeneous thought in terms of sociopolitics (left leaning) and that could maybe help implement more and more things till we figure maybe the state isn't necessary as a whole, etc. but as I said, it's a bit difficult given the people that have all the power would do anything to stop us since the beginning and would not agree themselves to get their status and money and everything to a level where they're seen as the same or less than what they were before. <-course that could get done if eventually we have a likeminded individual in a high political place but as I said, I personally think it would not happen that way or it would just take too long, same with just waiting for our society to shift towards a communist society, we go back to what we used to be, yes, but it usually takes around the same time
