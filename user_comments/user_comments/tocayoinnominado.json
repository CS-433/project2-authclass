So I do think reading, SRS, and other study (phonology, grammar, etc.) should make up the bulk of your time in the early stages (however, listening should still be a consistent thing you do, but just in moderation, like 15-20 minutes or so).\n\nBut how should you go about it?\n\nNow this is a hot take but given that at the start *nothing* is highly comprehensible, and that our only goal is exposure to auditory components of the language, I think the ideal immersion is watching compelling content with native language subtitles. Now, the reason native language subtitles tend to get such a bad wrap is because people will just say: \"Look at all those anime watchers who don't know any Japanese besides 'baka'\". But this a very weak argument given that the average anime viewer is **not even trying to learn Japanese in the first place**. Not to mention they have no basic foundation of vocabulary or grammar. Now as a learner who is learning the basics and wants to pay attention to how the language is spoken, this can absolutely be achieved with native language subs. This can even be an intensive activity where you simply speed-read the subtitles as fast as you can and try to make connections from the translation to the actual Japanese. Granted, this last part is far from necessary as. at the end of the day, we mainly want to get our ears more attuned to the sounds of Japanese.\n\nAside from that, graded readers with audio, simple short stories or fables with audio, short dialogues, comprehensible input youtube channels, and even textbook audios can be great at the beginning because there will be messages that you understand.\n\nLastly, listening comprehension is not something you can really speedrun by just doing a bajillion hours  of it anyways. For one it seems to be just a slow, incremental process, and on the other it is tied to your knowledge of the language, both vocabulary and grammar. Even if knowledge is not the problem your general processing speed of the language takes time to develop so there's no reason to whitenoise with input in the hopes that you will get native-like ability as quickly as possible.

In reality, the only way you can establish \"correctness\" of a given word or usage is by appealing to a given institution, such as some governing body, linguistic institution, or dictionary.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2htmI7-u1ng](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2htmI7-u1ng)\n\nI found a paper that talks about the consensus but it's from 1986. The paper itself seems to disagree with the consensus but because error correction's impact shouldn't be outright discounted as there are many issues with defining error correction (negative feedback) and measuring it. Paper:  [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/19417268\\_Feedback\\_to\\_first\\_language\\_learners\\_The\\_role\\_of\\_repetitions\\_and\\_clarification\\_questions](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/19417268_Feedback_to_first_language_learners_The_role_of_repetitions_and_clarification_questions)\n\n>The issue of whether negative feedback to agrammatical utterances plays any role in children\u2019s early language development was for many years presumed settled on the basis of Brown and Hanlon\u2019s findings (1970) that mothers neither provided responses of approval and disapproval differentially to well-formed and ill-formed child utterances, nor were more likely to produce \u2018nonsequiturs\u2019 (responses indicating mis- or non-comprehension) after ill-formed utterances. The conclusion that parental responses are unavailable to help children correct wrongly formulated rules or restrict overgeneralized rules has been incorporated into recent attempts to develop learnability models (Pinker, 1979, 1984; Wexler & Culicover, 1980) as well as into generally accepted assumptions about the helpfulness of parental input to children (see comment by Hakuta, 1984).  \n>  \n> In an attempt to replicate Brown and Hanlon\u2019s study (1970), Hirsh-Pasek, Treiman, and Schneiderman (1984) confirmed the conclusions regarding explicit feedback, but suggested a different interpretation for implicit responses. They reported that adults are more likely to repeat ill-formed than well-formed utterances, at least in conversation with two-year-olds.   \n>  \n>If one starts from the position that children produce their utterances with an intent to communicate, arid therefore will interpret a failure or postponement of uptake as negative feedback, it is clear from our results and those of many others (Cherry, in press; Garvey, 1\u2019379; Olsen-Fulero, 1\u2019382) that a high proportion of maternal responses qualify as negative feedback. Our results indicate, furthermore, that these negative responses are more likely to follow ill-formed than well-formed child utterances. Thus, the axiom of learnability theory\u2014that the model of the learner must be powerful enough to operate without negative feedback\u2014seems ill-founded.

The above is just theorizing about a potentially more optimal route. I don't really know how much you want to know, since you're learning Mandarin and not Cantonese, right? But I'll go into detail. Personally I did the following:\n\n1. Learned 500 most common words from [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ArxEFo46PTrDyDDhWyu3wB0epxqTyd8WBaprnwTEPm4/edit#gid=1428902047) (it's not the best resource, but I made an anki deck out of the top 500 and it was ok, but at that point it got really hard for words to stick and I started mixing up characters, even though I had basic familiarity of 200 characters from studying mandarin a couple years ago)\n2. Production RTH ( I did all 1500 because I plan on studying Mandarin and Japanese and there is no Cantonese specific one. I think production helped greatly with differentiating characters. I learned readings of many of these by putting it on the front so I learned a fair number of words just from this)\n3. I didn't really do this step exactly as I already had 500 words plus PRTH vocab. I did make a deck from [this](https://www.memrise.com/course/726961/no-typing-essential-cantonese-vocabulary-audio/) Memrise course, which was kind of a pain but it was nice to have native audio. I ended up ignoring all but a select 200 or so words because almost all of it I felt I already knew or I didn't care to learn. I also had accrued about 200 words that I was able to notice from my immersion, so I put that into Anki too at this point.\n4. For the grammar resource it was rough because I used [this](https://books.google.com/books/about/Basic_Cantonese.html?id=I1B9TRmQi5gC) book. However, Cantonese: A Basic Grammar has a new version with actual characters, but since I'm cheap I just downloaded the old version and am manually adding characters, jyutping and reformatting it. Ideally you could just buy the new one and mine from there. I had already read through it once before, but now I'm rereading, adding characters, and mining from it at the same time that I do Clozemaster. Also I mine sentences from a server on discord where natives type in Cantonese lol. I think it's super engaging and fun.\n\nWith 2000 words known sentence mining should be really fun and easy in my experience, so definitely get started on that!", "created_utc": "1595558975.0", "edited": "False", "id": "fz1ugyf", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_hw2jgn", "parent_id": "t1_fz1om8r", "score": "2", "subreddit": "MassImmersionApproach", "subreddit_id": "t5_rw8og"}, {"author": "tocayoinnominado", "body": "I think Clozemaster absolutely has a place here, but I don't use it as intended per se, I simply mine sentences from it.

Mandarin, Fuchow, Cantonese, Shanghai, Suchow, and the other major fangyan do not share the same written language. I have seen scattered materials written in these different Chinese fangyan, both in tetragraphs and in romanized transcription, and it is safe to say that they barely resemble each other at all. Certainly they are no closer to each other than Dutch is to English or Italian to Spanish. The discrepancies between the major Chinese fangyan in phonology, lexicon, orthography, and grammar are so great that it is impossible for a reader of one of them to make much sense of materials written in another of them. This is an entirely different matter from that of classical (wenyan), vernacular (baihua), and mixed classical-vernacular (banwen-banbai) prestige, non-local or national written styles that are read by literate individuals throughout China according to the pronunciation of their local fangyan. Written Sinitic, with exceedingly few exceptions, has been restricted to some type of Classical Chinese or Mandarin, since the other languages of the group have never developed orthographical conventions that were recognized by a substantial segment of their speakers. In sum, regardless of the fact that such statements are almost universally accepted among Western treatments of Chinese language(s), it is false (or at least dangerously misleading) to claim that all the Chinese \"dialects\" share the same written language. It is also frequently asserted that, while there may be enormous differences in vocabulary, pronunciation, and idiom among the major spoken Chinese fangyan, they basically share the same grammar. This assumption, too, remains to be proven, both in absolute and in comparative terms.\n\n> My only plea is for consistency in English linguistic usage.

Why is reading highly emphasized?\n2. Why is so much time spent with incomprehensible input?\n\nIn the MIA, and even in the very last Q&A, Matt asserts that reading is for learning the bulk of new words, while listening is for developing that instant auditory recognition. In my opinion and experience, it's much easier to learn new words through reading for a few reasons. Firstly, you actually have time to think about the sentence and how the components work inside of it, so it's easier to really look at the parts of speech and think about word order and separate words and phrases and whatnot. Also, it's much easier to pick out the unknown component because it is written for you, whereas when listening, the listener has to figure out what was said. Both of these difficulties are going to be compounded at the beginning of the process with even less knowledge to fill gaps. I would argue that the amount of repetitions to learn a word from pure listening is a lot higher on average than for reading a word. So why emphasize reading? Well you learn words more quickly, which makes your immersion more comprehensible more quickly, and leads to more 1 target sentences.\n\nI actually agree with your second critique and it follows logically from the conclusion above. In my experience, the benefits of completely incomprehensible immersion is limited to perhaps the first month or less. You can still learn words from it, but the pace is actually quite slow. I really couldn't stomach it so I learned the 500 most common Cantonese words, and then did RTH. Those words were definitely starting to get hard to remember in the 400-500 range, so I still think RTH is valuable. Either way, brute forcing a small number of super frequent words without RTH/RTK absolutely seems worth it from an efficiency and from an enjoyment stance. Those first few months of immersion will be orders of magnitude more valuable even with such a small vocab base. I think the MIA counterargument is that these words are so frequent that they will be learned the easiest. In my experience, this isn't exactly the case because of the difficulty of learning from audio mentioned in the first answer. It's very hard to isolate those common words without any or very limited grammar knowledge and limited phonetic intuition of how words blend. On top of that, these words tend to be the most meaning dense and have the most diverse ranges of usage. As a result, even these super common words can take a long time to learn, and these words are the cornerstone for making anything comprehensible, which slows everything down and not to mention a big hit to motivation.", "created_utc": "1592730156.0", "edited": "False", "id": "fviukrd", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_hd1nzm", "parent_id": "t3_hd1nzm", "score": "8", "subreddit": "MassImmersionApproach", "subreddit_id": "t5_rw8og"}, {"author": "tocayoinnominado", "body": "No problem!

I literally don\u2019t think I could think of someone that would say reading is overall harder than listening unless we are talking about someone that doesn\u2019t know how to read at all.

Carroll\u2019s (1967) study of the language pro\ufb01ciency of university seniors with foreign language majors is perhaps the most signi\ufb01cant work in this area because it was the \ufb01rst major study of its kind and because Carroll tested 2,784 students in French, German, Italian, Russian, and Spanish in listening, speaking, reading, and writing (Form A of the Modern Language Association \\[MLA\\] Foreign Language Pro\ufb01ciency Tests for Teachers and Advanced Students). Carroll reported that seniors were attaining advanced-high (ILR 2+) levels in speaking and listening and found this \u201cdisturbing\u201d: \u201cThe most striking thing about these charts is the generally low median levels of attainment ...they reveal\u201d (pp. 140, 134). If Carroll was disturbed by a mean learning outcome of advanced-high, one can only imagine how he would react to the results observed by Magnan (1986), Brecht, Davidson, and Ginsburg (1993), Tschirner (1996), Thompson (1996), and Davidson (1998, 2002, 2003), or the reported \ufb01ndings of the Defense Language Institute (Omaggio-Hadley, 2001) and the Foreign Service Institute (Jackson & Kaplan, 2001). Magnan found that the average oral pro\ufb01ciency level of university students in 4th-year French was advanced (not advanced-high, as Carroll had found). Magnan\u2019s \ufb01ndings for the lower levels in French (intermediate-low and intermediate-mid for 1st- and 2nd-year French, respectively) were con\ufb01rmed by Tschirner (1996) who studied oral pro\ufb01ciency levels of students of German in the \ufb01rst 4 semesters of a university German curriculum.\n\n [https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/j.0026-7902.2005.00262.x](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/j.0026-7902.2005.00262.x) \n\nThese terms of Advanced or Advanced-High sound good, but can be misleading if you actually look at the 1986 ACTFL proficiency guidelines. They are not high levels. Also, these are university majors and other people focused on learning the language, presumably motivated and highly interested in the languages that they want to learn. If that is the kind of level they can achieve, that is a failure in my book. For high school, we would expect much, much worse achievement.\n\n**Advanced**: Able to write routine social correspondence and join sentences in simple discourse of at least several paragraphs in length on familiar topics. Can write simple social correspondence, take notes, write cohesive summaries and resumes, as well as narratives and descriptions of a factual nature. Has sufficient writing vocabulary to express self simply with some circumlocution. May still make errors in punctuation, spelling, or the formation of nonalphabetic symbols. Good control of the morphology and the most frequently used syntactic structures, e.g. common word order patterns, coordination, subordination, but makes frequent errors in producing complex sentences. Use a limited number of cohesive devices, such as pronouns, accurately. Writing may resemble literal translations from the native language, but a sense of organization (rhetorical structure) is emerging. Writing is understandable to native not used to the writing of nonnatives.\n\n**Advanced-High**: Able to write about a variety of topics with significant precision and in detail. Can write most social and informal business correspondence. Can describe and narrate personal experiences fully but has difficulty supporting points of view in written discourse. Can write about the concrete aspects of topics relating to particular interests and special fields of competence. Often shows remarkable fluency and ease of expression, but under time constraints and pressure writing may be inaccurate. Generally strong in either grammar or vocabulary, but not in both. Weakness and unevenness in one of the foregoing or in spelling or character writing formation may result in occasional miscommunication. Some misuse of vocabulary may still be evident. Style may still be obviously foreign.\n\n [https://www.actfl.org/sites/default/files/pdfs/public/ACTFLProficiencyGuidelines1986.pdf](https://www.actfl.org/sites/default/files/pdfs/public/ACTFLProficiencyGuidelines1986.pdf)", "created_utc": "1590781184.0", "edited": "False", "id": "fs8eins", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_gsv5ff", "parent_id": "t1_fs86zmb", "score": "1", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "tocayoinnominado", "body": "If you think classrooms are the best place to learn a language, how do you reconcile the fact that almost all students in classrooms achieve awful results?

For example:\n\nLemma: talk, talks, talked, talking\n\nWord Family: talk, talks, talked, talking, **talker, talkie, talkers, talkable, talkability, intertalk\u2026**\n\nLemma: hablar, hablo, hablas, hablo, hablan, hablamos, habl\u00e1is, hablan, habl\u00e9, hablaste, habl\u00f3, hablasteis, hablaron, hablaba, hablabas, habl\u00e1bamos...\n\nWord family: lemma: hablar, hablo, hablas, hablo, hablan, hablamos, habl\u00e1is, hablan, habl\u00e9, hablaste, habl\u00f3, hablasteis, hablaron, hablaba, hablabas, habl\u00e1bamos... **hablador, habladur\u00eda, hablante, hablanch\u00edn, habladera...**\n\nSo word families can encompass quite a few words, although many of the forms can be understood from the lemma. Even so, you\u2019re looking at knowing around 40-60kish word forms or something thereabouts. It\u2019s really hard to put a number to. Let\u2019s say 40,000 for the hell of it; that would be 110 new words everyday for a whole year. Clearly, it\u2019s impossible to retain that much. However, C2 speakers not only know all those words, but they have more or less instant recognition of them, as well as a production capability of many of them. This amount of vocabulary is an enormous task alone, but it\u2019s really just a small piece of a C2 speaker.\n\n**Listening:**\n\nC2 speakers also have amazing listening capabilities. Listening skill is developed unconsciously by listening to a tremendous amount of the language. You can\u2019t really control how fast you will be able to develop this ability, apart from listening to the language as much as possible, but there will be diminishing returns of the course of each day. You aren\u2019t going to get better 6 times as fast listening 6 hours a day as you would if you listened 1 hour a day.\n\n**Speaking:**\n\nThere is a lot involved in speaking, from literal muscle memory to have proper pronunciation, to fluidity, accurate word choice, adequate speed and so on. This will also take a great deal of time to improve at. In order to speak naturally, correct syntax and grammar has to be largely subconscious.\n\nI\u2019m not even going to go into reading, writing, grammar, and general culture knowledge (including regional variation) and countless other little skills. The point is, there is a lot to learn and practice.\n\n**What about below a C2 level?**\n\nSo it is clear that C2 is out of reach in a year I hope. It doesn\u2019t matter how \u201cgood\u201d you may be at learning languages. Many people consider even B2 to be fluent, which is a very good level that also requires tons of vocab and exposure similar to the above, but to lesser degrees. You don\u2019t hear about too many people getting very fluent in 1 year. It\u2019s possible with highly related languages, but would still take a tremendous amount of time and effort, and the end result would still be quite limited. Also, a test can never get an accurate assessment of your ability. It\u2019s fine if you just want it as a certification, but do not conflate a test score with competence. Language abilities are too nuanced, and knowledge sets too vast for comprehensive assessment within a reasonable time frame.\n\n**Classes/Courses to get me to X level?**\n\nTaking from one of my other answers:\n\n>If the only Spanish exposure you get is in classes, you will never be fluent. You have to study outside of the class because fluency simply takes so long. Depending on the level that you want to reach, you have to spend hundreds to thousands of hours reading and listening followed by a ton of speaking practice. Also, classes are just horrible at teaching languages. They could be an okay-ish supplement to learning, as well as a source of accountability and structure, but that's it. NOBODY can teach you a language, just as nobody can teach you to the level of a professional musician. It takes lots of practice.\n\nThere is no course that can take you to a C1, much less a C2 level. You just consume native content A LOT. If you want to improve your grammar, read a book in the target language on grammar. If you want to speak better, practice speaking on your own or with native speakers.  If you want to know more words, use an SRS. If you want to know more about how the language works, listen and read and PAY ATTENTION. Developing language ability isn\u2019t math. You don't just plug in English into the formula and get the Spanish and once you have enough formulas you're done. You have to know what to say and how to say it in the countless and  very specific situations that come up in life. It\u2019s more akin to being able to play an instrument or a sport. Guidance and theory help, but are useless without practice.\n\nEdit:\n\n[Language isn't math](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8JK8W8dBxk)\n\n[Language as an ability](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LIz-Wbt4us)", "created_utc": "1585469014.0", "edited": "1585469985.0", "id": "flte5kb", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_fr0spi", "parent_id": "t3_fr0spi", "score": "11", "subreddit": "Spanish", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qtt1"}, {"author": "tocayoinnominado", "body": "[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YCESUUA0wL0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YCESUUA0wL0)\n\nDisclaimer: Don't shadow, unless you are already kinda fluent.", "created_utc": "1585446335.0", "edited": "False", "id": "flsno3u", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_fqwnso", "parent_id": "t3_fqwnso", "score": "2", "subreddit": "Spanish", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qtt1"}, {"author": "tocayoinnominado", "body": "I don't think there is any research yet.

After all, I'm considering teaching it, however the current state of classrooms by and large is ineffective. \n\n> It can be more efficient than anything else\n\nI guess I could buy this in an ideal setting with caveats. I think there are learners who aren't sufficiently self-motivated for which an idealistic classroom setting could prove to be the most effective method. The biggest barrier for learning is motivation and whatever keeps students learning is for practical purposes better than a more theoretically effective approach. I'm not so sure the input can ever be of a truly high quality in a classroom, though. The more input, the more anxious the students tend to be, and the less input, the less effective the classroom. It's a tough balance to pull off. Furthermore, the input tends to be limited in scope because the teacher 1. is always in a classroom setting dealing with academic topics, and 2. is not able to have a conversation with another native. This limited scope is likely not to be a problem for beginners, but the better the students get, the more problematic this one-dimensionality becomes. So the ideal classroom environment could only be the most effective for unmotivated beginners.\n\nI think classrooms today are missing 3 absolutely crucial components and have 2 crippling drawbacks. They lack discussion of effective language learning theory and strategy, they don't teach about how to use an SRS, and they don't help students find personally compelling content.

With languages that are very similar this is much less necessary, but with languages that are very distant from English (like Korean) this becomes even more important. It will help you with recall too because the synonyms in your head for certain concepts will be reinforced by the monolingual dictionary.

The present perfect in the first clause is not always followed by the imperfect subjunctive. It depends. Sometimes it is followed by the imperfect and sometimes by the present.\n\nThis actually turned out to be a lot more complex than I thought. Basically though, the rule of past main clause leading to a past subjunctive clause has exceptions. In addition, the present perfect is also exceptional in and of itself because it can act as a present or past clause.\n\nFollowing quotes are from the Nueva gram\u00e1tica de la lengua espa\u00f1ola (2010):\n> La forma he cantado \u2014o bien cant\u00e9 en algunos pa\u00edses: \u00a7 23.4.1b\u2014 es irregular, ya que se agrupa en unos contextos con los tiempos de la esfera del presente y en otros con los de la esfera del pasado.\n\nAs for concord of tense, there are restrictive and nonrestrictive verbs. Restrictive verbs require (with some exceptions) that the following clause falls under a specific category of orientation. The 3 categories are prospective, simultaneous, and retrospective. [V1] denotes the first verb i.e. the main clause verb, and [V2] denotes the second verb, i.e. the subordinate clause verb. \n\n> 24.3.1d Ya en las sintaxis latinas se observa que algunas propiedades sem\u00e1nticas de V1 determinan de forma esencial la dependencia temporal de V2. En funci\u00f3n de este criterio, los predicados verbales pueden ser RESTRICTIVOS o NO RESTRICTIVOS (\u00a7 24.3.1g). \nLos predicados restrictivos orientan la interpretaci\u00f3n temporal de sus complementos, a diferencia de los no restrictivos. Los primeros pueden ser de orientaci\u00f3n prospectiva, retrospectiva y simult\u00e1nea.\n\nVerbs that express judgement or assessment, such as \"reprochar, censurar, criticar, reprender, alabar, etc.\" are restrictive retrospective verbs. That is, they refer to a past action. For example, you generally praise somebody for something they DID and not something that they WILL DO, which doesn't make much sense. However, there are exceptions.\n\n> En efecto, la forma *abandone* (V2) en \"Le reprocharon duramente que abandone la empresa dentro de unos d\u00edas y se vaya a trabajar a una multinacional.\" equivale a \u2018vaya a abandonar\u2019. Expresa, pues, una situaci\u00f3n posterior a V1.\n\nNonrestrictive verbs are not bound by the past-present distinction. These include verbs that express emotions about something (sentir), verbs that communicate ideas (comunicar), and verbs that communicate thoughts (pensar, creer, etc.).\n\n>  La presencia en esta pauta de los factivos (\u00a7 25.3.2) se debe a que las reacciones emotivas pueden ser independientes de la localizaci\u00f3n temporal de la situaci\u00f3n que la provoca: Siento mucho que {haya tenido ~ tenga ~ tuviera ~ vaya a tener} problemas.\n\nAll of the choices in brackets are valid.
