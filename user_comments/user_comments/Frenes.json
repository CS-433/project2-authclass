There are more problem sets than paper writing, and I think I only wrote a paper maybe two or three times, although they were all research-design type things. You can take the major in various directions depending on your interests. When I did the major I was required to take all core classes in historical linguistics, phonetics, phonology and morphology, and syntax, although I believe there are now changes to that requirement, and phonology and morphology are now two separate classes which is probably for the best. A lot of people go in direction more oriented toward syntax and semantics, especially people who are double majoring on CS or cog sci.

My senior year I took a class called \"Field Methods\" with seven other students where we worked with a professor and a student he hired to produce documentation on an understudied/nearly unstudied Bantu language spoken in Kenya, and we all had to do a semester project working with the student informant to analyze a particular part of the language, I did mine on something related to morphology. In another class called Phonetics all students were required to do a field project documenting the phonetics of a language they don't know using an informant. My roommate at the time spoken Taishanese, so I solicited recordings from him and did my project on it.\n\n\nOverall, I would recommend taking Linguistics 100 to get a feel for the major.

The major is largely flooded by transfer students who either want to go to law school or saw the major as the easiest way to transfer to Cal, and this makes it so you can't take more than two upper division classes per semester, so coming in as a freshman to poli sci she should think about double majoring and minoring or adding two minors just to fill up her schedule after freshman year. I double majored in linguistics and poli sci and minored in Chinese and am now in grad school writing a master's thesis on something at the intersection of all of those. Berkeley poli sci classes are high quality and rigorous compared to poli sci at other universities. Obviously it's not a sexy major like CS, EECS, DS, Econ, or Business, but if you want to go to grad school for something related to poli sci, you will be well-prepared. In fact, the classes for the international relations master's program I'm doing with Johns Hopkins are significantly easier than my classes were at Cal, although my peers who went to other universities think the classes are harder than their undergrad which was kinda a shock for me. If she wants to go to law school then pretty much only GPA matters, and the class selection in poli sci is broad enough that there are what are clearly \"easy classes\" GPA-wise. However, professors and GSIs do not tend to grade evenly or consistently in my opinion, and an A+ essay for one class could get you a B- in another classes and vice versa. Definitely take advantage of classes called \"junior seminars\" which good for getting face time with professors, otherwise she will be fighting with law school gunners in office hours who want letters of rec. Also, if law school is not the goal down the line definitely take advantage of the strong quantitative classes Berkeley offers. Poli sci majors are required to take Poli sci 3, which is quantitative methods. A lot of poli sci majors think it is difficult but that is bullshit, it's essentially a basic stats class as it applies to political science research. In my opinion, data science is the perfect double major or minor for poli sci for people who do not want to go to law school.

One of the first things they teach in any introduction to linguistics is that written language is merely a representation of spoken language. Chinese characters originated during a time period when the language did not have as many homophones as it does today. There was a morphological system for altering word class and meanings of words, and this system was largely initial and final consonant clusters that slowly eroded and gave birth to tones. If Chinese were written exclusively using pinyin, you could read a transcribed speech just as well as if it were written with characters. Yeah, distinctions between some surnames would be lost in this case, but that isn't a huge impediment to communication. There is a big difference between not being used to how something is written and actually not being able to understand how something is written. If you tried hard enough and spent enough time, you could create a system for writing English with Chinese characters that wasn't just using characters to approximate the English sounds.

Like, no you aren't fluent in 12 languages after a month just because you completed the Duolingo trees across multiple speed run sessions.\n\n\nAt the end of the day, I think language learning will always be one of those things that attracts attention seekers. Hell, I know people who told me they kept studying Mandarin because they enjoyed the lavish praise native speakers constantly gave them for speaking it. It's also going to attract perfectionists, and in the 9 years I've been learning languages, both attention seekers and perfectionists have in general been less successful at learning any given language than people who just focused on their own development and were brave enough to make mistakes. Youtube \"polyglots\" are actually harming their own language learning by focusing on random surprise pop quiz-like street videos. \n\n\nI also believe the word \"polyglot\" is pretty pointless, but that's a separate and much longer discussion.", "created_utc": "1595307813.0", "edited": "False", "id": "fyqjlbz", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_hur5g2", "parent_id": "t3_hur5g2", "score": "15", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "Frenes", "body": "Solved!", "created_utc": "1595299847.0", "edited": "False", "id": "fyq7omq", "is_submitter": "True", "link_id": "t3_htodr3", "parent_id": "t1_fyihz8v", "score": "1", "subreddit": "tipofmyjoystick", "subreddit_id": "t5_2vkzr"}, {"author": "Frenes", "body": "Yeah, I would focus on making sure your armor is 3.

As far as diet goes, the calories in the food really creep up, and even something as simple as a bag of hot cheetos every once in a while can cause large weight gain over time. Three-meals-a-day culture also contributes to this, and it's better to have a small snack like a banana at most in the morning in my opinion.

Tones exist at all levels of speech, and only certain syllables will not have a tone in some words. When somebody says there aren't tones or that they aren't important, what it really means is that you can get a tone on a syllable incorrect every once in a while if it getting it wrong isn't contrastive in the word the syllable is in, or in the sentence the word is in, and speakers of dialects can often use non-standard tones when speaking Mandarin, and based on my understanding it is usually not a huge issue. It can also mean that tones aren't as exaggerated as they are in textbooks. Audio for beginner and intermediate textbooks and resources can often exaggerate tones on each syllable in a word. In reality, most words in modern Mandarin are disyllabic or more, and flow together more in everyday speech. I've noticed that in formal speeches, individual syllables can sound more pronounced as they might in learning materials, although I haven't heard tons of and carefully analyzed formal speeches to know for sure. In my opinion, it's better to get a tone wrong than to have no tones at all.

I settled my first couple cities north and northeast of my capital near a volcano, rainforest, and hills. I was lucky enough to get religious settlements which saved a lot of time and allowed me to grab one of those cities. Built a few of the unique units for defense in the cities away from the flatland to hold off the civ that was attacking me from the east, and from there I expanded southeast into some floodplain areas where I put up industrial zones, aqueducts, and dams as fast as I could while turtling in other areas. Using the first couple trade routes as internal trade routes for a cycle or two helped a bit as well, but I suspect in most cases it would be better to just take the gold to make purchases. Most of the flat land, which was filled with marshes and forests, I held off on working with until my border was secure and I had the industrial zones with adjacency bonuses set up, although they were settled as soon as possible to prevent AI from messing up the geometry. After that I pumped out builders as fast as I could, removed marshes, chopped, and plopped down as many farms as possible. The chopping went into building observatories. Those cities didn't have much production later on, but when possible I chose the golden age bonus that yielded production for campus adjacency bonuses. But yeah overall, I think hoping there are volcanoes, hills, and/or forests/rainforests within six tiles of the capital is important.

It's my personal belief that at the end of the day ability is most important, but it is undeniable that there are several programs that are much more prestigious, and many will also argue better in quality, than other language programs. If cost is the biggest consideration, then yeah, prestige probably shouldn't be as important since it is just a language program, but with funding it is best to go to the more prestigious programs. Another benefit that comes with the more prestigious programs that is often overlooked is networking and alumni networks. I did Princeton in Beijing a few summers ago and I encounter other alumni of the program from time to time and it is a great conversation starter and way to bond over a shared experience. Going back to cost, I think the best way to get the most out of prestigious language programs is to pair them with a prestigious fellowship or scholarship, like Blakemore, Boren or CLS, which aren't really options this late for the next academic year. If you do go to a less well known program, try to find people who have done it before and get their opinions before committing. I've heard more than a handful of horror stories about smaller language programs. Also, Beida is prestigious but it is my understanding that there are a handful of different language programs there. Harvard in Beijing is there during the summer, and the university runs its own classes during summer and during the year as well. I've heard very very mixed things about the normal university-run program.\n\n\nSo overall, if you have a fellowship or cost isn't an issue, prestigious program.

In one class I took, the California vowel shift was pretty clear when all the students in the class plotted how their vowels were produced. Students from California produced a noticeably more forward \"u\" sound, while students from outside of California had it more back. The caught-cot merger is more present in younger speakers, y'all is becoming more common outside the south, and the pin-pen merger is happening in some dialects. \n\n\nTLDR: After WWII there was a shift away from regional accents, but  regional dialects are still changing and emerging.", "created_utc": "1586199528.0", "edited": "False", "id": "fmm67p6", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_fw3uuc", "parent_id": "t3_fw3uuc", "score": "10", "subreddit": "AskAnAmerican", "subreddit_id": "t5_2uah7"}, {"author": "Frenes", "body": "Unless the language is relevant to the job and you have taken a test that can verify you are at the level that is necessary for the job, I would keep languages towards the bottom of your resume in a hobbies/interests section for example.

Second, if you are falling back on another language, it could mean you are just using the new language as basically a code for one of your previous ones.

I'm in a small town of about 50,000 people under the jurisdiction of a main city of about a million people around 6 or 7 miles away, but I've never felt isolated or lonely. The hospitality of the Chinese people is incredible, and students are generally incredibly happy and excited to have a foreign teacher. If you are big on trying new foods, China has incredible diversity in food, and it is theoretically possible to never eat the same thing twice if you wanted. Since I am a new volunteer I have not had the opportunity to travel yet, but the high-speed rail system is one of the most developed and extensive in the world, and such a big country has no shortage of interesting and unique places to travel when you are on leave. I should admit, my experience is partially influenced by having a higher level of Mandarin and prior familiarity with the culture (advanced-mid on the exam Peace Corps has volunteers take), but for the most part I use English exclusively with all of my students and other teachers unless they request speaking Chinese, so I wouldn't be too worried about Chinese being labeled by many as a difficult language, as it will be of most use with interacting with people outside of your school. Overall the training provided by staff during PST is extremely effective, maybe even one of the most effective and well-organized training programs I have ever been through. Some people (in my opinion) unjustly slam the China program because many parts of China are wealthier or more developed. The provinces volunteers serve in are not the more wealthy parts of the country, and none of the Peace Corps's three goals state that the goal is to help exclusively poor countries. The three goals are extremely relevant and necessary in China, especially because there is a tendency for foreign expat English teachers to not be very good, and a whole bunch of stereotypes come along with that, but for Peace Corps volunteers none of that is an issue, and many schools, including mine, speak very highly of volunteers.

English for obvious reasons, Russian because the clear division between Western Europe and what is formerly the Eastern Bloc still exists to this day and is still creating problems, and French because French is one of the only European countries with replacement birth rates. People in this sub love German, but I've heard mostly horror stories from people who've actually tried to go to Germany and speak it there.\n\nIf your focus is the Americas then stick with Spanish, although Portuguese would be essential if you had Brazil in mind considering it is projected to be the biggest powerhouse in the region in coming decades.\n\nIf your focus is Subsaharan Africa, French and Mandarin are the ways to go. Although regional languages are challenging the dominance of the French language as a working language in West African countries, the elite still speak it and will speak it for decades to come. China's power in Africa is growing literally daily and I would not be surprised at all if Mandarin becomes a common language for business there in the next few decades. For me at least, I've been told by a diplomat that knowing Mandarin and French has me set up for a good career serving in Africa if I ever become a diplomat.\n\nIf your focus is the Middle East, obviously learn MSA and then the dialect of a particular country if you choose to focus on one.\n\nIf your focus is Central Asia, then Russian and Mandarin are definitely your best options. The elite in many of those countries still speak Russian, which is also commonly spoken as a 2nd language among people of most social classes still. One Belt One Road will increase the importance of China in this region, likely increasing the importance of Mandarin. ALSO, Uzbek will be essential in this region!\n\nIf your focus is East Asia, then you are really at a toss up on whether you should just go with Mandarin or learn Korean or Japanese, it would really depend on if you wanted to just focus on a particular country, but obviously China is multiple times bigger than Japan and the Koreas combined so you can't really ignore that.\n\nFor Southeast Asia, the situation is a bit weird. Although none of these countries natively speak English, English is viewed as more of a neutral language due to ethnic tensions in places like the Philippines and Singapore. The region has a massive Chinese diaspora which has only recently begun to adopt Mandarin over their ancestral regional dialects. Since you clearly already speak English, Mandarin would be helpful for doing business with the Chinese diaspora, which holds insane amounts of wealth in some countries relative to the native ethnic groups. Malay/Indonesian would also be a strong respectable choice, and if Jokowi wins the election again, Indonesia will likely increase in importance even more as an economic power in the region.\n\nIf your focus is Australia or New Zealand, Chinese influence in those regions is starting to become pretty extreme in all areas of life, especially politics.

I have friends who've passed DELF B2 and they all say I'm better than them so when I take DELF sometime within the next year I plan to start there. \n\nAs for Mandarin, I've built entire meaningful friendships with people without ever speaking a word of English to them, although vocabulary is still nowhere near that which I have in French. I attend a top university and have reached the highest level of Mandarin a good two years minimum than 99% of students at my school according to my teachers. I can understand quite a bit on the news and some dramas to a lesser extent. \n\nFor Spanish, I dabble every now and then. I was originally going to start it after French but put it on hold for Mandarin. At best I am probably A2 in Spanish, but my reading skills are MUCH stronger than speaking and listening, and I've used Spanish sources when writing research papers before.\n\nI'm hesitant to use the word fluent, but I studied French actively for four years in high school (I basically had one on one attention for four years because the other students didn't really care at all) and one year in college. It's been a little over two years since I last studied French on a daily basis but I still remember almost everything except for some stuff I learned towards the very end. \n\nFor Mandarin, I've been studying less than two years, although I did spend the last two summers in Beijing taking classes, including one summer at the famous Princeton in Beijing program.\n\nSpanish has been on and off since probably 2013/2014ish?\n\nI am currently 21 years old.\n\nI move on whenever I feel like I won't forget the language if I stop using it.\n\nFor tackling multiple languages, I would say really REALLY drill the phonology of each language into your head. I had this big struggle with Mandarin and French where I'd try to speak French and I would start speaking Mandarin mid-sentence, but once I really drilled in the tones and phonetics of Mandarin, as well as working on fixing my French pronunciation and intonation, this all mostly stopped with the exception of when I use conjunctions for whatever reason sometimes.\n\nAlso a lot of people say not to do this, but I am a die-hard believer in just memorizing massive amounts of vocabulary. You won't always have access to native speakers depending on where you live and IMO native materials can get frustrating when you have to look up words constantly and then switch back to the text. What Runescape taught me growing up is that sometimes a long grind is just necessary to be able to do some process or activity even at a basic level. If I didn't just sit down one summer and go through a couple thousand words of French after my Freshman year of high school, I likely would not remember the language still today, because even if I don't see a word for years, it WILL come up eventually. Like for Mandarin just the other day a slang word came up that I hadn't encountered since my first couple weeks. It was the word that means \"acting like a pretentious prick\" which came up when I was talking to a friend about college applications. If I didn't drill that word into my head back then, that conversation literally probably would've fallen apart in my confusion. Even if you are focusing on one language, just pick up vocab in the one you have saved for later.

A massive amount of Mandarin speakers today are in a sense non-native speakers, often having spoken a dialect before learning Mandarin. Although on the decline, nonstandard accents are very much a thing, and Xi Jinping is supposedly the first chairman to speak Mandarin with a standard accent.\n\nThrough two summer intensive programs with prestigious universities in Beijing, I have reduced my foreign accent substantially, and Chinese people often just say I sound like I have some random central/northern village accent they can't pinpoint, and this is the case as well for many of my peers. Even so, the bigger issue in Mandarin is non-usage of tones, which many beginners think they can get away with. From what native speakers have told me, even if someone uses non-standard tones half the time, they are much more likely to be understood than someone who uses no tones at all.\n\nI also disagree that English native speakers are tolerant of various accents, particularly foreign accents. While some speakers of other languages do not have much exposure to foreign accents relative to anglophones, I argue there is much more of a power dynamic tied to accent when speaking English. Using Mandarin as an example again since that has been my focus for the past two years, many people assume lesser intelligence or ability of people when they speak English with foreign accents (although exceptions might be German and Russian accents). Although people might consciously realize this is not true, it is still ingrained into the psyche of even the most tolerant of many anglophones, and I will admit that I have underestimated many Mandarin-speaking friends when I only spoke to them English, whereas now I can go days only speaking to them in Mandarin, only to feel the difference in power that society places on accent dissolve, and for this reason there are some people I will only speak to in Mandarin now because even though the tables are turned in terms of language ability, it just does not seem that a nonstandard accent for foreigners (this can still be the case for native Chinese with regional accents, for example, when I was buying food at a stall once in Beijing another customer made it a point to tell me and the migrant worker who served me that my Mandarin was more standard than his) puts them in a subordinate position.", "created_utc": "1527483665.0", "edited": "False", "id": "dzp0btk", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_8mjkin", "parent_id": "t3_8mjkin", "score": "5", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "Frenes", "body": "Unless you are planning on going into academia I would not recommend majoring in a language, just do the minor and pair it with something related to what you might want to do.\n\nUsing myself as an example, I am double majoring in International Relations and Linguistics, with a minor in Mandarin and possibly also in French.
