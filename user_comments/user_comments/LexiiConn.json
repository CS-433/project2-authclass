For example, you may see the words \"LOOK\", BOOK\", COOK\" and \"LONG\". If you touch on LOOK, you'll see a notice in the bottom right corner that says something to the effect of LOOK = 3.

Yes, it is perfectly possible to play without questing. That\u2019s the way I\u2019m playing  my current playthrough. \n\nI started with a mod that allows me to skip the opening scenes (you start in the vault and make your way outside). I ran into Codsworth who suggested I go to Concord. I did that and cleared out the town BUT did NOT talk to Preston. Instead, I just grabbed the bobblehead and skedaddled out of there. \n\nFrom there, I went to Red Rocket and set up camp. I\u2019ve just been exploring and crafting ever since. I have no settlers, obviously, and that\u2019s just fine by me. Because I went to Concord, Codsworth is available as a follower, should I ever want/need one. So far, though, I\u2019ve been running solo (I sent the dog to Sanctuary). And that\u2019s the way I like it. \n\nI done about 20 hours so far. Aside from going to Concord, I\u2019ve done one other quest (I handled the situation at the Drumlin Diner so I could have access to a trading post). Other than that, no questing, main, faction or otherwise. \n\nIt\u2019s working quite well. I should mention one other thing, though: it probably helps that this is not my first run at the game. I platinum\u2019d it a few years ago, so I\u2019m already familiar with the environment and know what to expect pretty much wherever I go.
