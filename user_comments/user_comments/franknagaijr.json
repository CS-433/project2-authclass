A sing-along is different because there will be a musical combo with a dedicated singer on all songs. The volume will be moderate so that if you are singing along, you can definitely hear yourself, and if you sing with your outdoor voice, your neighbors can hear you too. A sing-along is generally more democratic than karaoke.\n\nIf you have pre-arranged a specific song with the band, or if the spirit moves you, there will be a 'guest microphone' that can be used. We ask that you not be a 'microphone hog', and refrain from holding the mic for two consecutive songs - even if nobody else appears to want the microphone at that moment. Thank you.\n\nFAQ 2: Will the performances be accurate to the recordings?\n\nNo, but we will try to keep it in the ballpark. We will try to keep the tempo the same, the chords the same, and the key generally the same (a few exceptions for the sake of the accordion), and the song structures also the same, so if you are used to singing along with the recording, it will not be too jarring an experience for you. We may throw in some melodic breaks and/or guitar solos that are not on the records at our discretion.\n\nFAQ 3: Accordion?\n\nYes. It's the optimal sing along instrument. It clearly marks the tempo and chord structure.\n\nFAQ 4: What if I don't know the lyrics by heart?\n\nWe are still working on a system to let you know what songs are coming up, so you can dial them up on your smart device. In an ideal world, we would use a projector to show the lyrics as we perform, but I'm not sure if we will have that ready for this show.\n\nEDIT 1: The venue has just confirmed they have a projector.

A 45 minute drive to a downtown former union hall. Load in is easy, we have a stage with reasonable dimensions, and our hosts are adamant we start on time (we always do if the prior band surrenders the stage on time, thank you.) It's a lumberjack convention, and the hosts really want a blow-out party. We not only set up on time, I'm able to help out the AV people who are setting up a slide show and don't have a clear understanding how to set up their audio, and I even loan them the cable they need. \n\nIn the first two hours, they blow through 8 kegs amongs several hundred rough and tumbles, and the hosts need to make a beer run. They've got a food truck, and they have hired hostesses in Dirndls to keep it lively as well. It feels like we can do no wrong, as they like our polkas, they like our rock-polkas, and there's almost never a dull moment. There's a bunch of raffle prizes to give out which are our breaks, and we get to jump the line on the food truck, although we are mocked thoroughly by the drunk folks waiting for food. All in good fun. \n\nThe hostesses lead the chicken dance and the flieger lied, and generally keep the mood light. Definitely the best ziggy-socky, ziggy-socky response of any crowd we've had, ever. Hamilton rap is now a keep in the set, or as I introduce it, our sobriety test, which I pass. \n\nNot sure if this is a booze-fueled promise, but apparently the CEO who hired us has expressed his intention to invite us to play his party at next years convention 6 hours drive away, which would be lovely. Says he will hook us up for some white-water rafting as well. So we did pretty well by all accounts. \n\nSaturday - my first 'long' motorcycle ride in at least 10 weeks. During the height of the season my weekends are spoken for. Naturally I ride to a distant motorcyle dealership to test ride a different cycle, the super tenere. \n\nSunday - Leave the house at 11:20 AM, pick up keyboard guy and we have a 3 1/4 hour ride to a downtown hotel at a convention center. Our sponsor is a German firm who is holding a free booze/food schmooze affair for the conference that starts the following day. The space is about the size of a classroom, decorated up for Oktoberfest, and we can see we need to be very aware of volume. With just keys and accordion, we find a volume that people can talk over but we can still hear ourselves. It's a very big contrast to go from the party-makers Friday to the background on Sunday. It's a five hour gig, well paid, and for the first hour we play the hyper-traditional stuff, and then after that we mix in our surprise stuff, and every now and again some conversatin will momentarily pause and we see a look on somebody's face 'Are they playing what I think they're playing?', which is nice. \n\nFor our breaks, partner does some solo tunes while I break, and then I do some solo accordion while he breaks. For my first solo set I play a bunch of musette and klezmer instrumentals. For my second break, I sing some numbers I rarely do in public. I'm playing 'Hair Match' by the Mountain Goats and not even singing into the microphone, and when I finish, the 6 people on the far side of the room start applauding, which has not happened all evening. I'm guessing they had never heard the song and assumed I wrote it? Thanks, the Mountain Goats! Somebody mentions that their company sponsors a tent in Munich, so I pass him a bunch of business cards on the minute chance that he mentions us to whoever in Germany, one never knows. \n\nSo five hours simultaneously drags on and goes by quickly. The food is nice too. It takes us 45 minutes to load out because of the distance from the hotel lobby to the elevators and from the elevators to the space. It's raining really hard for at least half the drive. Apparently tornados were coming in as we were leaving. Home around 1:30 AM. Oktoberfest officially concludes for us, with our most raucous (sp) and quietest gigs of the season on the same weekend.

We've yet to break into the local German Restaurants and Clubs as all, so it feels good to get contracted to play a banquet.

The person who helped me so much with song pronunciation is a very rigid teacher in terms of method and speaks mostly in English to me and does not really give a good back-and-forth. The new teacher challenges me, points me to the Assimil system, and seems to want to push the students in a good way. \n\nThere's a Senior Center Oktoberfest an hour's drive away. I've played here before and there's a native speak of Polish and another of German. I think I do alright. Just for fun, I mix in exactly one rock polka since there are a few comparatively younger folks in wheelchairs who seem the right age for a little Purple Haze polka. \n\nImmediately after the performance, I drive two hours North up country roads to pick up my child who is on fall break at University. We turn around immediately, and I am home just after midnight, having logged over 300 miles and 5 hours driving. The following morning I have to drive a child of mine for wisdom teeth removal at 7:15 AM, so I think I got 6 good hours of sleep Thursday night.\n\nFriday\n\nFriday is a busy day at home, and we have a local performance for a change. By local I mean a 45 minute drive from my home. They also say they have their own sound system, so I pack two speakers, my clothes and axe and a handful of cords. I hit the road to arrive 30 minutes before the show is scheduled. Drummer sends me a text as I am leaving that he is already there. I have a panic attack that I have the start time wrong and get him on the phone to confirm the start time as I'm heading out. I have time right, and my pulse comes back down.\n\nArrive for the gig, we have reserved parking with our name spelled correctly. It is a neighborhood Oktoberfest at a church, well-attended. We have an opening act, a local woodwind quintet, and I know two of the members from another ensemble I used to play with. They sound great, but they also seem to take at least one minute, often two, between each number with no talking or anything, just discussing what to play next among themselves and getting consensus and then flipping pages. They apparently started late, and they play late, playing their last song about 35 minutes into our set, and it takes us 10 minutes to swap over. The guy with the check tells us not to worry, the check has already been written, and we can stop playing at the agreed-upon time without penalty. During our setup , I also loan him one of our nice speakers so he can run sound to the beergarten area as well, and the other speaker I packed is our monitor, and we use every cable I packed. \n\nWe play 2 hours 15 minutes with a 15 minute break, and we are in top form. Crowd loves what we do, and so do we. I should not have had the half-a-beer during the last 30 minutes, as I space out a couple times toward the end. Toward the tail end of the show, one of the buttons on my new Lederhosen breaks, and it holds the suspenders, without which my pants will eventually fall down. We pack up pretty quickly, and Keyboard's car won't start and he needs to have it towed home. We make sure he's got it covered, and I tell him I will pick him up in the morning. I am home around 11 and shower for an early morning. I'm pretty amped up from a good show, so I get maybe 3 hours of sleep tops, leaving the house at 4 AM. \n\nSaturday\n\nOut the door at 4 AM to pick up Keyboard player. No equipment for him, just the accordion for me, and we both have our Lederhosen, Nat\u00fcrlich. 30 minutes to his place, another 20 to the airport and we are checking in for a flight. I have put us on the earliest possible flight in order to avoid any of the typical travel snafus that involve landing 3 hours before the gig starts. My band-mates are not thrilled, but they put up with getting up three hours earlier to ensure peace of mind.\n\nConnecting flight, we land close to 10 AM, get the rental car and we're all tired and ready for a nap. We decide to treat ourselves to a good breakfast, so we hit the google maps and pick a popular place. Sure enough, it's a 25 minute wait, but we've got nothing but time to kill. I orer the Corned Beef Hash Benedict (yum) and we ask the waitress what's fun to do in town. She asks if we like beer, and sure enough she's planning to go to the Oktoberfest that evening and is tickled that we are the main attraction.  After breakfast we still have two hours to kill before hotel check in, so drummer and I go for a walk about town while keys takes a nap in the car. \n\nHotel is merciful and lets us check in at 1 PM (I was calling all morning), which means we've got 4 hours till we need to leave for the show. I get a 90 minute nap in. I leave the hotel in search of a button fix. At the gas station/convenience store adjacent to the remote hotel, there is nothing, but a kindly truck drive sends me to a flea market two miles down the line. I go through the flea market, where everybody is packing up, but I find a shopkeeping woman who offers to sew it for me. We chat about the show, and how she lives in the same town as Steve Martin, who apparently does occasional unannounced shows with the Steep Canyon Rangers for the locals. She refuses to take any money and tells me to put on a good show. I continue walking the flea market, and there is a taco stand that looks very authentic. I order three tacos and chat up the counter-man (Dad of the family operation) and he compliments my spanish. I give him a business card and tell him about the show, which is apparently in his neighborhood. I tell him if he show up I will sing a couple in Spanish. The tacos are yummy. \n\nDrive to the show at 75 minutes before the start time, everybody dressed and ready, and we get to the venue at one-hour to go. Phil and John are the sound guys and have us set up with keyboards, guitar and drums. I bring my accordion, of course. I forgot to ask for a music stand for my ipad, so I stack up empty drum cases to the right height, and weigh my contraption down with mic stand bases. Sound check is easy, and we even have time to go for a walk through the fest and come back with five minutes to spare. We are given the check and food tickets before we even start. We say hi to our breakfast waitress (she hugs us), as well as a German woman who has been waiting for our show for hours. \n\nWe have four hours of stage time, so two 70 minute sets with 20 minute breaks, and one 60 minute set to close. I spell this out to all parties concerned, and it works out pretty well. Up till now we had not spelled out breaks so clearly, but this is a bigger show. I even announce the times to our audience so they know exactly how long they would need to wait for the next set. We are accurate to the minute. I have sauerkraut balls at the second break along with some meat on skewers. The balls are good, better than the other two times I've had them on tour. Still not as good as my favorite local joint that makes them, though. \n\nFlying in for a show is a next-level for us, since we hadn't done it before. We've driven crap-loads of miles, and it's nicer to just fly in, not worry about the PA system, and do what we came to do. The taco stand Dad and family show up during the second set and Dad approaches to say Hello, recording everything on his phone, and so we do BBP in Spanish (I can do BBP in German, English, Spanish and Italian. I really should learn the Polish version too!), and then we play 'Just Because' because it has a verse in Spanish. His family is dancing too. Between songs I do a quick endorsement of his taco stand. \n\nDuring the early set, I get some feedback in my monitor. John tells me it is because my glasses are bouncing the sound back to the microphone, but he has a fix. We are definitely playing at a rock show decibel level. \n\nThere are tons of toddlers and preteens dancing all night, and because this is the 11th annual, plenty of people in Lederhosen and Dirndls who are also dancing, which definitely sets the mood. There is a couple who must be close to 70 years-old in Lederhosen and Dirndl who dance to every Waltz, and almost all of the polkas, which is impressive at any age, so I get a picture with them at the break. We play Chicken Dance in all three sets, Hokey Pokey in all three sets, and 'FliegerLied' in two sets, and get really good Fliegerlied participation. Our first set and third set have a fair amount of overlap, but not completely, and our second set has no overlap apart from the handful of must-plays. (BBP, Ein Prosit, Chicken)\n\nAt 10 PM as we are packing (my accordion and done!) the sound guys tell us that they normally dread working this event because the bands are so often limp and lifeless, and they were super-happy with what we did, because we really try to mix it up and give everybody a good time. They had no incentive to pump up the out-of-towners, so I take them at their word, and leave a couple business cards. We are ecstatic, the evening could not have gone better. \n\nSunday\n\nLeave the hotel at 445, make the flight and the connection without any major issues. Pretty sure I got 3 hours of sleep at best (pumped again.) I sleep a full 8 Sunday night, although I'm still a little lagged Monday. \n\n\n\n\n\n", "created_utc": "1508813800.0", "edited": "False", "id": "dosvnc1", "is_submitter": "True", "link_id": "t3_71eg4y", "parent_id": "t3_71eg4y", "score": "1", "subreddit": "Accordion", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s4ll"}, {"author": "franknagaijr", "body": "Nope, don't go there.

Eat some junk burgers on the way and arrive with 1 hour for setup. Set up is fine, it's an outdoor pavillion with nice weather. After our initial sound check we are asked to turn it down, and then to turn it down even more five minutes later. I am generally not opposed to being background music, but I expect background music to pay well, and I don't usually like to travel such a great distance specifically to be background music in costume. \n\nOur saving grace for this performance are the toddlers and the pre-teen kids, who are totally into the polka and whatever we are up to, and they danced along to the music for the better part of two hours, and they were fun to watch, and made us feel like we weren't strictly background stuff. Thanks Kids!\n\nPack up quickly, a record 30 minutes from last note to shut-the-doors and drive, thanks to parking adjacent to where we played. We have a 2.5 hour drive to Southern Kentucky, plenty of it through semi-rural roads in Kentucky, so we did get to the low fuel light on the van before we were able to fill up. Arrive at midnight our time, and we park 10 feet from the water in the no parking zone (special dispensation) and we have a five minute walk over docks to our 'boatel.' A so-so nights sleep, and I'm the first up in the morning, and I start moving all of our equipment except for the PA to our boat, which is across from the floating stage (aka, the party barge). \n\nSaturday  - I brought a bunch of food and coffee with me, which is good because the camp store is way expensive. I buy a gallon of water and a bar of soap for five bucks, beg a coffee filter from the store, and that's all I need. Part of our agreement is that they will hook us up with a boat, but neither of my band mates are interested, so instead of a boat, they set me up with a jet ski, and I spend about 2 hours on the river, and eat my lunch on the jet ski below a waterfall. I sunburn the tops of my feet, but otherwise I had SPF 30 on, so not too bad. Still some hours to kill before we start, my bandmates have set up the PA and we do a sound check, then nothing to do but relax till it is time to play.  One band mate is sea-sick all day, not into the gentle motion of the houseboat at all.\n\nFour hours of performance, with breaks filled in by a German Dance Troupe. We probably did a mix of 60 non-trad/40 trad all day, since a lot of the folks did not seem interested in the German music, and were especially happy with the Jimmy Buffett song. The food was good, the performance was fine, although perhaps one of the smallest crowds we have played for this season, but there were apparently a bunch of people listening from their own boats, or it sounded that way at least. I have a few brain-freezes during the performance, which I blame on mild exhaustion coupled with a single beer an hour before we started. None of the brain-freezes impact the performance too badly. \n\nSix hours drive home Sunday. \n\n", "created_utc": "1508160724.0", "edited": "False", "id": "dofwlnc", "is_submitter": "True", "link_id": "t3_71eg4y", "parent_id": "t3_71eg4y", "score": "1", "subreddit": "Accordion", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s4ll"}, {"author": "franknagaijr", "body": "Based on a quick glance at your reddit history, you'll want the lessons, as it looks like you don't have a musical background.

Ordered some new loudspeakers too, after the headaches of the prior weekend. Then it's time to pack the van. \n\nFriday \n\n   11 AM. 50 minutes drive to drummer's, then  another 3.5 to arrive with 45 minutes before show time. We are outside of a factory in Indiana, and we have been contracted specifically for the German content. I've been working with a tutor on Skype to do the new songs, and I've learned about 10 new German songs specifically for this engagement. \n\n   When we arrive, the tent is closed, the stage is tiny, and we have to scale back our sound system quite a bit. Two loudspeakers, no monitor, and the drummer uses a reduced kit and is diagonal in order to fit on the stage. We are three in a horizontal row, as the stage shape dictates. Show is fine, we play the requested tunes and get compliments from the German in HR who brought us in. It feels a little anticlimactic after learning all the new tunes, but that's okay. Conclude the show by 7:45, at the drummers place by midnight. Reasonable nights sleep in a strange bed (at least six hours.)\n\nSaturday\n\n   Need to be on the road by 930 for the first set. A brewery that is two hours north. Because I was not clear enough in my deal-making abilities, we are playing the worst possible schedule. 12:30 to 2:30, then 5 to 7, and then 9:30 to 1130 PM. Between our sets, there is another polka band, and a dance troupe. We are literally sharing the stage, half-and-half with the other band, and we are each setting up our own PA, as we had agreed. I more-or-less volunteer to help the dance troupe with their sound system. We have 45 minutes to set up and socialize. First set is fine, nothing particularly memorable about us or the crowd.\n\n   Finish the first set, and it's hot outside. Help the dancers set up their ipad to play their soundtrack for the children dancers. Track down the owner, and he gives me the check. He had agreed to feed us for the day in emails back and forth. He has a bar with a full kitchen, and gives us $25 each in outside food truck tickets - No store credit in his air-conditioned bar/restaurant. The outside food is not very good - worst sauerkraut balls I've had in quite some time. After lunch I got to a coffee shop two blocks away and order a cuppa joe, then go hang with my guys in the van, since we have nowhere else to go. \n\n   Second set was solid and well received. A wedding party showed up for a drink, which was fun. A couple people came up to me during the break to let us know how much they liked it. We strive to be a solid traditional polka band that is not very traditional once the crowd is bored with the trad stuff.  Then we had another 2.5 hours to kill, mostly in the tour van (an older honda odyssey van with three seats, everything else flat for maximum loading. With our sound system, we completely fill it and have to pack consistently/strategically. It was fun to watch the dance troupe do their famous woodchopper dance in which they literally split a log with four choppers in time to the music. \n\n   Third set was both a triumph and a disaster. The tent was covered and theoretically protective from the elements, but rain was coming in from the sides a little bit, and the sides were not secured to the ground, so the wind was whipping the walls in and out by the time we started our evening performance. The night crowd is younger and really digging our rock polkas as well as our Oktoberfest crowd-pleasers. There is a street person who has been hanging out in the tent for hours not making a fuss, so security has left him alone, and he is super-enjoying our rock polkas, standing next to the stage and singing along and bouncing. At one point, once the band we shared the stage with had cleared out, he climbs up on stage and wants to share the microphone with me. He's a heavy smoker and pretty smelly, and further, I don't share the mic with people I don't know well, no matter who they are. At the conclusion of the song, he calls me a microphone hog, and I have no desire to get into some youtube-worthy scene with the guy, I'd just like to continue performing unmolested. After a very long minute, a cop walks up and tells him if he does not come off the stage, he will be asked to leave. He behaves and gets down, leaves about 30 minutes later, and he is no longer our biggest fan. \n\n   That same set, we are playing a medley, and I'm about to go into another song, and the drummer yells at me - 'stop the song right now!', and it takes me a moment to understand, but our equipment and cases that are not on stage are getting soaked from the heavy rain coming in under the tent. We stop and move everything to high ground, the part of the stage formerly occupied by the other band, and that rules out anybody else jumping up on stage as well. While it is pouring, the bar owner is smoking a cigarette inside the tent, maybe 10 feet from the stage, which pisses me off a little bit. Seems like as the owner, he is setting a bad precedent. If anybody else had lighted up, I probably would have gone all primadonna and asked them to put them out, I'm trying to sing over here. \n\n   We've been trying to hawk t-shirts this season, not for the money, but for a little publicity, but nobody wants a shirt. A couple people came up and asked for Despacito, and I asked if they would buy a shirt in exchange - they passed. Another young dude came up and asked for Freebird, and when I declined he seemed genuinely puzzled. I announced on the mic that we would play freebird for $100. He was already walking away when I did that, so I was just being mildly a jerk, not specifically mean to him. Oddly enough, I was actually going to try Despacito for the first time publicly during the medley that got rained out. \n\n   Finished the set at 11:30, fully packed and ready by 12:05. Two hour drive to the drummer's place, then we unpack some equipment, and I have a 45 minute drive after the bars have closed. No visibly drunk drivers. Home and in bed by 3:30 AM. \n\n   Lesson learned: I was too flexible on the scheduling with the bar owner, and he did not take a moment to think about what would have been kind to us, but instead gave us the worst possible schedule. If he invites us back, I need to specifically negotiate stage times and get a better rate as well, since I gave him an early bird rate even though it took him 10 weeks to make up his mind and send us a deposit. \n\n   No gig Sunday. Just as well. \n ", "created_utc": "1507565512.0", "edited": "False", "id": "do4j8xv", "is_submitter": "True", "link_id": "t3_71eg4y", "parent_id": "t3_71eg4y", "score": "1", "subreddit": "Accordion", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s4ll"}, {"author": "franknagaijr", "body": "I also play Diggy Diggy Lo habitually as well, from the Hallar book.

Yippie!\n\nThursday - A solo senior show in Lederhosen. 45 minute drive, 90 minute performance. Senior shows are typically one hour, and it was clear that this should have been too. Many folks were still engaged at the 1 hour mark, but they were clearly flagging as an audience at the 75 minute mark. Tickets with the missus to see 'Fun Home' that evening, a devastating and very good musical.\n\nFriday - We originally had a verbal in place to open for a Rock Show in Cleveland (Strumbella) as part of the Sam Adams Oktoberfest series. We had agreed on a crappy pay and a 3 hour drive in order to play a Cleveland show since the other two guys still have plenty of family there. After a long bout of silence, I check with the promoter, and he responds with one line, an ambiguous misspelling: 'We have gone with another and'. That's the full e-mail. I double check the transmission to confirm that we have the night off.  Those grapes were sour, as the Cleveland family would have need to buy full price rock show tickets to see us play.  We get the night off.\n\nWorth mentioning that we also seemed to have a verbal for Saturday noon for a local brewery, and when I check back after five days of silence, they say they don't have the money. They were pursuing us and we were doing them a favor by booking two gigs on the same day at a reasonable price. I'm assuming these folks are used to rock and roll bands, who they presumably treat like garbage regularly. \n\nSaturday - 2.5 Hour drive for a 7-11 PM show in one of our states highest attendance Oktoberfests. From 7-8 there are still children in the audience and it's fun to watch them bounce around. After about 830 the vibe changes quite a bit. They sell beer in quart containers, and the crowd gets more unruly as the evening wears one. We played shorter and shorter chicken dances to calm them down, and we did our best to not have even a moment between songs so the drunks would stop requesting the same song we had just played five minutes before. Brought me back to my bartending at weddings days, when babysitting was in the job description. We survive unscathed. Pretty sure we played chicken dance 8 times. \n\nCrash at the drummers place for a mid-afternoon gig the next day.\n\nSunday - Oktoberfest at a golf course 2-5 PM. Uneventful, and well received. We try out some new material in preparation for a special gig week 4 and it goes okay. We have issues with our monitor speakers and setup generally. I open the wallet for two new powered speakers, and a few more cables, should arrive by next weekend. The new speakers will take less space in the van, which was full to capacity this weekend, and pretty hard to repack at the close of the evening.  \n\nI'm beat.

Crowd is not terribly participatory, but many of them do seem to subtly appreciate what we are doing. I test out a few new requests for our upcoming real-germans-in-the-audience show, including my first attempt at techno in public with the voice box taking me up an octave.

Seems like the same architecture as the new Columbus Down Library. Hmm. We finalize the setlist for a tight, non-stop two hour show. It's hot in Dayton too. \n\nOur biggest show of the season, the beer tent is huge, and folks are pretty responsive to what we are doing. We play Hamilton too fast, and our Devo number a little sloppy, but a pretty good show. Sleep at home.\n\nSunday - Playing a local bar, (45 minute drive) for a four-hour duo show. Once again we split up solo and duo material so that there's never technically a break. Our Bollywood singers come to try out a couple numbers in public (not tight, but getting there) and we socialize some. The performance area is outdoors between two volleyball courts, overlooking the swimming pool which was very popular that day.

Get to a music shop in Bath for a quick practice with Will White, the Tuba player who volunteered to join me at the show that evening. For 30 years he ran the 'Tuba Museum and Restaurant' in Okemos Michigan, and he reports that most of the people he used to play polka with have shuffled off this mortal coil. Then to the stage for a quick rehearsal with the drummer, a multi-faceted musician named Donny Brown, who played with Verve Pipe back in the day.  Show went fantastic, then I took off to visit friends from way back, realized I left my garment bag and had to go back. I slept in a cheap Lansing cheap hotel near the home of my friends who have cats. Just from being in their house two hours I was already allergic reacting. \n\nSaturday - Breakfast with my friends and on the road by 10 AM with my truck full of gear. Drive the 4.5 hours back to columbus for a late lunch with my wife (not in my home, which would have been an extra 30 minutes each way, that I did not have), then rush to the drummers place for load-up, and off to the biggest gig of the season so far, the Minster Oktoberfest.\n\nWe played the Gazebo stage, on the opposite side of the Festival from the Chardon Polka band. I've yet to be able to check them out, but I'd love to see them do a full set. We play four hours, the first hour in daylight with lots of kids bouncing around the square. There must have been a 100 people doing the chicken dance at one point. At this festival, they sell beer by the 1 quart milk jugs, so there were a lot of dancers. During our last two hours, it is raining on and off, but we did get people up and moving with our tunes, so it felt good.\n\nWrap up at 11 PM, and our van is two blocks away at the designated band parking, with no way to get it closer. It starts pouring hard by 11:15, so we did not load the van till close to midnight, and the ride to the drummers, which is normally 1 hour, takes close to two, and it feels more like piloting a submarine than driving. \n\nDrummer offers me a bed, as opposed to driving an additional hour in the rain and driving right back the next morning, which I take him up on. Two nights away from home, so glad I saw the missus for lunch. I crash immediately and sleep on and off from 2 AM-ish till 10 AM. \n\nSunday - Drummer cooks a fantastic breakfast, shows me his new mandolin, and it's time to get on the road for another gig. 2-5 PM at a country club about an hour from his place (2 hours from my place). Their golf tournament was cancelled due to the heavy weather, and we set up to play in an outdoor covered pavilion that is maybe 50 yards away from the indoor bar and club. The weather is nice and sunny by the time we get there. For our first set, people leave the building to check us out and dance a few songs from 50 yards away. It's a big contrast from playing for literally thousands the night before, more like a paid open rehearsal. Because there is only one wall behind us, the acoustics seem optimal for recording, so once I get caught up, I've got plenty of raw audio to sort through to see what is usable as marketing collateral.\n\nAfter the first hour, only the very young and very old are outdoors. This is a golf club, and the Ryder (sp) cup is on the TeeVee, but I keep getting feedback that the crowd of 150 that we cannot really see can hear us, and they like us. For the 6 very young kids, we do multiple chicken dances and hokey-pokeys, and young kids have an instinctive reaction to the Oom-Pah beat, so anything we play makes them bouncy. 20 minutes before we wrap up, the owner asks if she can pay us for another hour. Sure! We're tired, but we've already put in the hard work, so playing for another hour for money is pure gravy. At one point I tell my other two players to take a break, and I play every children's song I can think of, then I start making up random polkas on whatever topic the very young kids ask for. Something about Crabs and Pickles was a hit, as was a song about bananas. This weekend we split up the singing duties more amicably, so I was not hoarse by Sunday afternoon, as I was last weekend. \n\nOne more double-header weekend to go, then a couple single-gig weekends, and we will have survived 'the Season'. \n\n(Ninja Edits.
