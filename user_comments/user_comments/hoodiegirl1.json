As I was on the phone with 911 they told me to go find someone to be there with me, so I ran up the hill behind the house at that moment a friends car drove up. Apparently my mom had called her parents before driving back. I was panicked. I didn't know what to do. I remember the 911 person reprimanding me on the phone for not knowing the address of the place (this angers me to this day), but I did give her all the information I had about my location. The ambulance did find us eventually. They went down the wrong street and i was waving my arms to get their attention from where I was. \n\nFrom then on everything was a blur. The ambulance had caught the attention of the other old busybodies in the community and they all found their way down. I knew them all but that helped. I couldn't stop shaking. For 2 days I couldn't stop shaking. Even remembering it now I start shaking again. \n\nI was alone other than the many people I wasn't very close to. A friend of a friend who had come and was a nurse came out and shook her head. She kneeled in front of my and told me they'd done everything they could. The paramedics were two minutes behind her saying the same thing. I broke down. I was bawling and rocking back and forth. My friend and her mom were next to me the whole time holding me or my hand. I calmed down for while. Until I saw my moms car drive up. \n\nNo one had called her. We knew she was coming and no one wanted to risk her getting into an accident on the way. If you ask her today she'll tell you god gave her a false sense of hope as she got closer to the house. It rained her entire drive out but when she got within 10 minutes of us the clouds broke and the sun shone through. A friend of ours was pacing in the driveway when she pulled up and she knew as soon as she saw his face. \n\nThat was the worst moment for me. Seeing her realize what had happened. Hearing her cry. \n\nI've spent so much time since that day trying to support my mom while living my own life. I gave up on certain dreams to keep her sane. It's been about 10 years and we're both doing well. She's managed to keep busy and make new friends and even date from time to time. \n\nI'd say that was the worst week of my life though.
