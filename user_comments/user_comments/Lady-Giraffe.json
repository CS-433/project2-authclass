You'll get used to the way the characters speak, and you'll get to hear the same words and expressions again and again, which with help you acquire new vocabulary.\n\nHere are a few pieces of advice on how you can improve your listening skills:\n\nTip #1: Practice. I\u2019m going to start with something pretty obvious. To improve your listening skills, you need a lot of regular practice. Movies are not the only content you can listen to. You can also listen to other people, podcasts, TV shows, news, audiobooks, and YouTube videos. Interest and enjoyment are crucial, so choose materials you actually like.\n\nTip #2: Turn on subtitles. If you want to use subtitles when you\u2019re watching a movie or TV show that is challenging for you, go for it! However, as I said earlier, I\u2019d avoid subtitles in your own language. Translation is just an additional step that will hinder your progress towards understanding. You can watch the same episode of a TV show a couple of times, first with subtitles, then - without.\n\nTip #3: Learn to understand fast speech. When people speak fast, they naturally tend to mesh their words together, drop some sounds - stuff like that - and it can be tough for you to follow what they are saying. JenniferESL has a series of YouTube videos on how to understand fast speech better.\n\nTip #4: Listen to a variety of accents. People speak in a huge variety of accents, so get used to it if you want to really understand what people are saying in English. Don\u2019t focus just on the General American Accent because it might be easier for you. Diversify your listening sources. Find different English speakers with different backgrounds. YouTube is a fantastic place for that.\n\nTip #5: Listen to podcasts. In my opinion, podcasts are the best way to boost your listening skills fast. You can listen to them while you\u2019re walking, doing the dishes, or driving. You can always start with podcasts with slow English and then move on to more challenging ones aimed at native speakers. There\u2019s a huge variety of podcasts on the internet. Think of any interest you have, like history or movies and TV shows, and I guarantee you\u2019ll find a lot of podcasts on this topic.\n\nTip #6: Listen and read at the same time. When you\u2019re reading a book, you can pick up the audio version of this book and read and listen to it at the same time. It\u2019s an awesome exercise to improve your listening skills, and as a bonus you\u2019ll know how to pronounce new words you stumble upon. You can do the same thing with some podcasts that have transcripts, or TED Talk speeches.\n\nTip #7: Listen and transcribe. Here's a great exercise: You take a short clip from a TV show, movie, or a TED Talk, listen to a small part of it, write down what you hear, and repeat the same thing for the rest of the clip. After that, you take the transcript of the clip and analyze what you got right and what you missed. To challenge yourself, choose clips with dialects and less common accents. It\u2019s a wonderful exercise to improve your listening skills and comprehension. Also, spelling.\n\nTip #8: Improve your passive vocabulary. Often, what keeps you from getting what another person is saying is a lack of vocabulary. You just don\u2019t know some words and expressions. Slang can be super tricky. You can talk to people and ask your interlocutors to explain the words you didn\u2019t understand, you can read contemporary novels and boost your passive vocabulary through learning words from context. You can also watch modern TV shows and YouTube and look up words and phrases they use in the dictionary.

I've got interested in scientific research in this area because of that.     \n***- How is the community? Some communities are somewhat toxic. As far as I remember the only drama in this one was the whole \"be fluent in three months/Benny\".***\n\nI'm not a part of any communities right now, and I don't collaborate much with other creators. My own community is really small right now, and I'm contemplating creating an Instagram account to help it grow and blossom. I'm not a big fan of social media, though.   \n***- Are you able to make a living out of it? This is not my plan, though. Languages is one of those hobbies that I would never make my job since, for me, that would take the joy out of it. I'm curious since we never know about language influencers, it's not like fashion/fitness/lifestyle... that are pretty popular.***\n\nMy channel is not monetized yet because I don't meet the criteria. I don't think I'll be able to make a living out of the channel but that's not my goal right now. I got accepted at university to study English Language and Culture, so YouTube is going to be a hobby for me for a long time anyway . I hope I have enough resilience and perseverance to continue making videos. It's a lot of fun but it's also hard work. \n\n  \n***- What's something that you've gotten to do/to have because of this blog/channel that you didn't expect?***\n\nYou need a crazy amount of skills to make videos on YouTube if you're doing it alone. I had to learn about different kinds of microphones, audio mixing, lighting, editing (I went from iMovie to DaVinci Resolve, so I had to learn everything twice), color correction, script writing, b-roll, J-cuts, L-cuts, creating simple animation (I love Keynote), camera settings (ISO, shutter speed, aperture), graphic design, sound design, photo editing, being comfortable in front of the camera (an ongoing process), marketing, and a lot more.  \n\nIt's a lot, and the journey has been equally fun and frustrating for me. I'm glad to read and answer every comment right now, and I'm happy when I hear that I helped someone even a little bit in their learning journey or that they picked up a book in English because of me. I'd love for more learners to experience the joy of reading for pleasure in their target language. \ud83d\ude42", "created_utc": "1645082031.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hxa49eu", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_suafcm", "parent_id": "t3_suafcm", "score": "1", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "Lady-Giraffe", "body": "I hope you'll find something useful in them. \ud83d\ude42", "created_utc": "1644954795.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hx2rvfk", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_st8d4g", "parent_id": "t1_hx2ph0e", "score": "2", "subreddit": "EnglishLearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2u8ap"}, {"author": "Lady-Giraffe", "body": "Great video! \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb I'm glad you chose not to use the anime itself because anime is notorious for creating copyright issues on YouTube. \n\nThe sound effects are a bit loud compared with your voice but maybe that's just me. \ud83d\ude42", "created_utc": "1644952962.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hx2n3a9", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_st8g1q", "parent_id": "t3_st8g1q", "score": "1", "subreddit": "EnglishLearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2u8ap"}, {"author": "Lady-Giraffe", "body": "To improve a specific grammar area, I analyze various texts and also transcripts from TV shows.

I actually read an issue of Scientific American a month from cover to cover for a year, and I really enjoyed the experience. Some articles, like everything about neuroscience and astrophysics, were really challenging to understand, but that didn't stop me because they were still really fun. Apart from being complicated, *The Economist* was super boring for me as I detested reading anything about economics and politics.

I adore Jane Austen, and her *Pride and Prejudice* is a masterpiece. Check out *God Bless You, Mr Rosewater* by Kurt Vonnegut Jr. if you want a really interesting take on capitalism and socialism. *Brave New World* by Aldous Huxley, *1984* and *Animal Farm* by George Orwell, and *Fahrenheit 451* by Ray Bradbury are simply fantastic.", "created_utc": "1639295107.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ho821wg", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_refp08", "parent_id": "t3_refp08", "score": "1", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "Lady-Giraffe", "body": "You don't need to use \"impressive\" vocabulary during the speaking part of the test.

It was a children's book, and even though it was challenging to start reading it, the book became much easier to read closer to the end. It had the English text on one side and the Russian translation on the other. I ditched the translation in the middle of the book. After that, I started reading a variety of children's and YA novels on an e-reader, which made the reading process much easier and more enjoyable. I always tried to choose books that were fun (so, a lot of fantasy novels). \n* **Dutch:** I'm a beginner in Dutch, and today I've finished my 6th book. I read them on my Kindle, and used two dictionaries embedded there, which I downloaded earlier: a Dutch-English dictionary and a Dutch-Dutch dictionary (I checked pronunciation there). All of them were children's books written by a wonderful Dutch author, and I really enjoyed every single one of them. The first book was especially challenging to go through because my vocabulary was poor and the knowledge and understanding of grammar were pretty non-existent. I had to look up every other word and guess the meaning of whole sentences and paragraphs. I didn't give up, even though the book was obviously too difficult for me. I wanted to read it so much! The characters were just lovely, and the plot so fun! While I was reading it, I learned some basics of Dutch grammar and sentence structure. It helped a lot. The next five books were filled with fun short stories about two children (by the same author). The books were perfect for the learners like me: enjoyable, easy to digest, the simplest vocabulary possible - (but useful!), short sentences. The best reading experience! \n\nI don't write down any words while I'm reading for pleasure (extensive reading). I look them up in the dictionary on the Kindle (while trying to guess the meaning from the context first) and move on. I'm planning to take a few short stories I've already read and work on the vocabulary there (intensive reading).", "created_utc": "1634478924.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hgzgbhj", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_q9xl2e", "parent_id": "t3_q9xl2e", "score": "5", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "Lady-Giraffe", "body": "I'm a huge Tolkien fan and I read almost everything he ever wrote.
