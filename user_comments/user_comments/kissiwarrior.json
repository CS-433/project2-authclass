After about a generation or two/three, they will almost most definitely feel \u201cdifferent\u201d or not a a part of their original ethnic group and I think that\u2019s the case with many African groups(as well as mixing due to enslavement, wars, cross tribal marriages, etc.)", "created_utc": "1661001429.0", "edited": "False", "id": "il2amlz", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_wso3n6", "parent_id": "t1_il195kh", "score": "1", "subreddit": "AncestryDNA", "subreddit_id": "t5_3lh3c"}, {"author": "kissiwarrior", "body": "Yea, it\u2019s just not a good head way to understanding African origins. .3 could come from anywhere and I\u2019m not a fan of that.

You made my point by saying not all Goldie\u2019s are family dogs\u2026socializing dogs is extremely important. Being a family dog isn\u2019t the same as being hyper or being relaxed, being a herder or being a couch potato. \n\nCollies are not good dogs for a lazy lifestyle and the same could be said about Great Danes and owners who are avid hikers. \n\nSo no, I do not agree with you when it comes to behavior. What you\u2019re referring to is temperament and that still CAN be breed specific.", "created_utc": "1639418035.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hoelabc", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_revfle", "parent_id": "t1_hod2u9a", "score": "0", "subreddit": "lookatmydog", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s6t5"}, {"author": "kissiwarrior", "body": "I feel this.
