It seems so much more comfy for our cat to wear when needed. We reused this cone later to prevent our cat from grooming hot spots and works great.

Seems obvious, but this seriously makes a huge difference. Don't go to a cheap stylist who will give you some cookie cutter men's cut. A mediocre haircut will look mediocre even on Jennifer Lawrence. A good stylist knows how to make the short style appropriate for your face, head, ears, neck, and hair type.  \nAnd 2) don't wash your hair everyday. Wash it as little as possible and use dry shampoo. In fact I only get my hair wet in particular spots that are sticking up weird from sleeping (a little spray bottle of water is perfect for this!), and then I do a full wash 1-2x per week. The reason for this is that short hair needs texture, and if you wash it every day, it's just a clean even sheet of hair hanging on your head.  \nBy the power of dry shampoo, a little water squirt bottle, and the very occasional hair wax/pomade product, I do very little work for my hair and get compliments on it regularly.  \nEdited for typos and grammar.", "created_utc": "1434657706.0", "edited": "1434657986.0", "id": "csb3277", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_3a9uww", "parent_id": "t1_csarfgn", "score": "6", "subreddit": "TrollXChromosomes", "subreddit_id": "t5_2sekm"}, {"author": "Khal_Pogo", "body": "100% happiness! :P", "created_utc": "1434642340.0", "edited": "False", "id": "csasgni", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_3a7gvp", "parent_id": "t1_csaatj3", "score": "1", "subreddit": "Fallout", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qnzu"}, {"author": "Khal_Pogo", "body": "Yeah I think of my purchases in a \"cost per use\" philosophy.

There are cheaper places to live, but depending on how far they are from work, you may not want to put rent over commute. The traffic is really bad here and can turn 10miles into an hour. watch the flows of traffic on Google maps to see where you want to live in relation to the office or see if public transport via VTA or Caltrain is an option. Or even biking. That said, this area is awesome and I love it here.

I wear glasses, and while sitting motionless on my couch, I'm able to see my hands, body shape, etc. but here's Ward moving around and not getting busted. It seemed really far fetched for him to not get \"caught\" before the mirror part. Why not send in May, who has a female body shape, similar height, etc.?\nNow on the rewatch, it's like, holy crap those discrepancies don't even really matter, right? In fact, Ward might have even (off screen) volunteered himself on purpose to carry out the mission for Akela and \"complete it at all costs\" as he says in the episode - to ensure that Garrett gets the information about the funky map writing.  \n\nDoes anyone else have any thoughts about this? Do Garrett's minions know who Ward is?  \n\nEdit: upon rewatching more episodes (sorry folks, my husband can't wait for only 2 days a week haha) it seems like most hydra/Garrett minions do not know who Ward is. I just watched Turn Turn Turn, and Ward has to take down like 12 dudes amidst the Hydra uprising at the hub who seem to try pretty hard to kick his ass.

I agree that the initial cost is high, especially if you don't know whether you will like it or not. The way I justified the risk is that if I *did* end up liking it, think of how much you will end up saving by not having to buy tampons or pads anymore! Part of why I switched was because I do yoga and sometimes when I tighten up my muscles down there, it would cause tampons to start to slip out. That doesn't happen as much with my cup, so it's a lot more comfortable for me.  \nSomething I love about the cup vs tampons is that you can leave in a cup for up to 12 hours without even worrying about it (although you may want to empty it every 8-10hrs if it's a heavier day) - I always had concerns at the back of my mind about TSS also, and was constantly wondering if the tampon was leaking or slipping out. Once you get the hang of the cup, it rarely ever leaks.  \nI will say that if you're brand new to tampons, perhaps it would be worthwhile for you to use tampons for a few more cycles as you get used to, uh... putting menstrual products up in there? And getting the angle right? Because the angle of a cup will be more or less the same as a tampon. Inserting a cup definitely has the learning curve as I mentioned in my previous comment, but it's not rocket science. If you decide to take the plunge but you aren't getting the results you want yet, stick with it and read some tips online! The Lunette comes with a little guide, but my insertion method that works best for my body wasn't in there and I figured it out by reading more tips from other women online.  \nLast, I *think* there's a website where women sell their cups to each other if it ended up not working out for them, at a reduced price. Keep in mind everything can be cleaned and disinfected, so if you can get past the mental thing with that idea, there's another suggestion to get past the steep initial price point. Can't recall the link right now, but I bet a quick google would find it for you.  \nHope this helps, feel free to ask any questions!", "created_utc": "1419805386.0", "edited": "False", "id": "cn7q5ba", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_2qlef2", "parent_id": "t1_cn7ptgx", "score": "2", "subreddit": "AskWomen", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rxrw"}, {"author": "Khal_Pogo", "body": "It grossed me out too but omg it is awesome.

I can't answer all of your questions, but I can tell you what it was like for me. I'm 26 now but my parents got divorced when I was 19.  \nBeing considered an adult, custody won't be an issue. I think someone already mentioned this in another comment. Someone also addressed the violence (very sorry to hear about that), so I will skip that part too.  \nI was away at college when my parents sprung the news on me. Since I fortunately was living in the next city over, I didn't have to live with them directly most of the time, but when I did have holidays I stayed with friends to get out of the house. I'm an only child, so I only had to worry about me. My parents, like yours, acted like children, trying to get me to be the middleman between their bullshit - asking me to deliver each other's mail back and forth, asking me questions about the other, etc. I put up with it for a time before putting my foot down, and I wish I had done that sooner.  \nI personally recommend that you and your siblings have a discussion to get on the same page. For instance... Discuss staying neutral between your parents to the best of your ability (it's hard now, but better in the long run when things die down). Agree to let your parents handle things amongst themselves and not to give into their begging or request for favors. Stick together and come up with a plan where the 3 of you could spend the night if things get nasty. Support each other :)  \nI saw in a comment that you said you kinda feel like this has been caused by your mom. This resonates with me because I felt (and honestly, still feel) the same way. My mom had an affair with someone who was somewhat important to the family and it broke all our hearts. My dog ended up being put down for bullshit reasons despite my best efforts. My grades suffered. My mom had tangible blame, but my dad probably played his part in it all since a relationship takes two people. It was a crappy situation for everyone to have to go through.  \nI wanted to cut off my relationship with my mom. Everyone told me I shouldn't do that, she's your mother, blabla. I listened and tried to make it work, and frankly, I still wonder to this day why I bother sometimes and I have those doubts. This is where you will have to make decisions based on your own situation. But I will definitely say that it's best to try to remain neutral for as long as you can - once the dust settles, you never know what will happen and it's best not to burn bridges until you are sure it's the right choice.  \nBeing an adult and watching divorce happen is certainly different than being a young child, but you will get through this!  \nNow that I'm a few years removed from the situation, I can definitely say that things are better now. My parents weren't happy together, and now, they are much happier apart. My dad has built a new life for himself and he's showing qualities I never knew he had. My mom learned lots of new things when she had to fend for herself and is recently starting to show more concern for others. Perhaps your family will also be better off after this whole ordeal. :)  \nEdit for typos and clarity.", "created_utc": "1403821239.0", "edited": "1403821758.0", "id": "cihziuw", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_2960u7", "parent_id": "t3_2960u7", "score": "2", "subreddit": "Divorce", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qipv"}, {"author": "Khal_Pogo", "body": "House of Cards: San Francisco ", "created_utc": "1403799966.0", "edited": "False", "id": "cihoocb", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_295mto", "parent_id": "t3_295mto", "score": "1", "subreddit": "bayarea", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qjyy"}, {"author": "Khal_Pogo", "body": "This is true, I have a pair of decently cute sandals that have Velcro on them.

Not sure what kind of phone you have, but if you have an iPhone/iPod/iPad, here's two of the many that are available:  \n[MintyVox](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/mintyvox-pro-female-voice/id577476241?mt=8), pretty straightforward and has commonly used stuff.  \n[Fat Cat Fast 20](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/fat-cat-fast-twenty/id526834814?mt=8) seems more for kids, but free! So could be useful for the experimenting aspect.  \nI work with a lot of children with autism and speech delays. It's certainly not the same situation as you, but I just wanted to throw it out there that some of these kids use apps such as these and other devices as their primary method of communication and they get really fast with picking out the words they want and putting together full sentences, etc.  \nMight be useful if you're in a bind by yourself with someone who doesn't sign?  \nAnyways, thanks again for sharing your experiences in this thread! :)\n", "created_utc": "1394172696.0", "edited": "False", "id": "cfwj7ob", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_1zrlok", "parent_id": "t1_cfwaq7z", "score": "1", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i"}, {"author": "Khal_Pogo", "body": "I thought your tips were great!
