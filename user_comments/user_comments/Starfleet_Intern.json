But as hard as it is to internalise, try to remind yourself there is no schedual for any particular part of life, even those who think they've hit the marks \"on time\" end up in different places than they expect.  Life is neither a marathon nor a sprint because it's not a race, it's not even an art competition it's just a project we are all working on. Remember that it's especially normal for non-straight people to be on a slightly different timeline, given that we are less likely to do the highschool sweetheart thing, and we don't have a whole bunch of role models in our comunity. The perfect time to find the woman of your dreams is whenever you find her. \n\nAs for self acceptance, I really recomend seeking out lesbian media. I really like gentleman jack, Imagine me and you, and She-ra and the princesses of power. Find people you can be around who accept you as you are. Other Lesbians as friends are a blessing, as are frienships with gay men, or anyone who you can talk to about your attraction to women as if it were the most natural thing in the world.

Precisely by checking if he wants to hug, asking if he would prefer to cheek kiss when we greet instead (which would be less intimate in his culture), and not going for small casual touches all the time, I am expressing my understanding of who he is and the fact I care about him through physical touch. \n\n-Like you I also have other very high ranking love languages, so I lean in to those\n\n-I cultivate other friendships where cuddles, casual hugs and so forth can be dominant as expressions of affection", "created_utc": "1646823171.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hzyiahg", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_t9ydo1", "parent_id": "t3_t9ydo1", "score": "1", "subreddit": "LoveLanguages", "subreddit_id": "t5_3ch8b"}, {"author": "Starfleet_Intern", "body": "I think everyone has a more complicated relationship to the love languages than \"this is my giving, and this is my recieving\" here are some of my thoughts on how it can be pretty complex? \n\n\\- Do you have a \"heirarchy of needs\" like I feel very loved by thoughtful gifts and acts of service, but only as an icing on the cake, if someone isn't giving me quality time then they feel hollow \n\n\\- do you like different ones with different people, my best friend is big on physical touch in romantic relationships, but seldom in platonic ones\n\n\\- are some of them little and often, and others rare and incredibly poignent.

There are also things like gender \"euphoria\" the rush one gets from something that affirms a persons gender and other reasons for transition. \n\nFirst of all, what I think you mean is a cis woman, and there are a lot of ways a cis woman might look and act. I am a cis woman, I don't wear makeup, I don't want children, and I don't date men. None of that is traditional. And none of it makes me not a woman. It doesn't make trans women less womanly either. \n\nSecondly the change of pronouns is not a reward given by others for changes made. It is one of the changes being made. Like you said these changes are being made to allieviate dysphoria. They are not done to convince you.\nFor example: one of the things causeing dysphoria for a trans man might be overhearing someone calling him \"she\" or \"a woman\" or simply knowing that they think of him this way. So he would ask his friends and family not to do this. Once he had made this change he would probably notice that it made him feel better, he might then begin adressing dysphoria he feels around his body by wearing a binder and taking testosterone. Later he might have surgery to remove his breasts.  At this point he might realise that he is at peace with having a vagina, or he might realise that he feels dysphoric about it and decide to have surgery. Or maybe he feels dysphoric sometimes but using a packer helps enough that he doesn't think it's worth the risk. Notice how all of this is to alleviate his dysphoria and make him feel happy with who he is.

In fact, have barely seen a handful of cis men who looks like hulk hogan come to think of it - he clearly puts a lot of time and effort into being bulky and muscular. More than most men in fact. So when you say \"looks like hulk hogan\" I assume you mean \"is clearly not a cisgender woman\".\n\nYou also couldn't possibly know that someone who looked like that was trans unless you spoke to her.

It doesn't sound like you get super close to them so I couldn't possibly say. If you are talking about trans women, they are in various stages of transitioning. Let me explain something to you: when someone decides they want to transition they begin a process that takes YEARS and costs a SHIT TON OF MONEY.  Not everyone has the recourses to do an overnight \"call me Caitlyn reveal\"\n\nTop surgery, facial feminisation, voice training, hormones, bottom surgery, laser removal of hair, are all expensive, effort heavy processes. Each trans woman does these things one at a time, over many years. The hormones and surgery carry risks in themselves. Each trans woman has to weigh the pros and cons of each of these processes.  Most clinics will not begin to discuss hormones and surgery unless the person in question has been \"living as a woman\" for a year minimum.  The supportive thing to do is to respect the way that someone wants to be referred to.\n\nA new name, pronouns and wardrobe, often only in certain spaces, to begin with, are the first steps a person takes towards living as themselves.

Especially where comphet is involved. From my experience looking back, when I first started having sexual fantasies, I didn't realise I was doing it. I would fantasize about being or being attacked by a vampire woman. This gave me a window to imagine intense physical closeness and pleasure in the arms of a woman without having to admit what it was about or even what I would actually do with a woman . When I started fantasizing about men there were a few ways it would happen:\n\n\\- I would imagine a fictional couple the man and watch it in \"third person\" or from his perspective \n\n\\- I would imagine myself being forced to have sex with a man and turning out to enjoy it as the man or watch it in \"third person\", my features would often blur into a generically attractive woman with my colouring and I would also enjoy imagining being made \"normal\"\n\n\\-I would fantasize about having sex with a man but there would be a woman there for some reason and I would imagine myself in a position where I couldn't see the man and be looking at, kissing, or holding her\n\nWhilst I kind of enjoyed these they always gave me an uneasy feeling. Now that I have given my sexuality some TLC, by seeking out erotic content I enjoy and being very deliberate about sexual self-care, as well as having had some actual experience with women these have slowly faded away although they occasionally pop up. Now I occasionally fantasise about being a man with other men and that feels very different to the above-mentioned fantasise.\n\nHere are a few questions that might help you. I wonder how much you know about lesbian sex, \"lesbian porn\" is for straight men, so is not a good resource. Do you have lesbian friends who can tell you about this, do you read erotica, or watch content made by actual lesbians like gooddykeporn or lesbian onlyfans accounts? Your problem might be coming from a lack of knowledge about what to do with a woman.  If the \"fantasy productions studio\" of your brain wanted to make a lesbian sex extravaganza movie for you, would it know what to put in there?\n\nWhen do you imagine sex with men where is your focus? is it on the experience of sexual pleasure or on the man himself? Are they about specific men or generic \"male figures\"? Are you fantasizing in the first person or are you watching in the third person or imagining yourself as the guy? Is the woman in the fantasy you, or another woman, or a strange slightly altered you, but not? Essentially is the fantasy really about the guy or about some dynamic or physical sensation you can't imagine with a woman?\n\nHope this helps.\n\nEdited for typos", "created_utc": "1624971805.0", "edited": "False", "id": "h3fo0tm", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_oa738r", "parent_id": "t3_oa738r", "score": "11", "subreddit": "comphet", "subreddit_id": "t5_xv0in"}, {"author": "Starfleet_Intern", "body": "If there has been an implicit \"once this lease is over, so are we\" for a few months, would it help you to make that explicit?

This gives you a crush to talk about with your friends and to occupy your mind, all without the risk that one day he will actually ask you out. \n* Sort of connected to the previous one - Gay men won't make you think about if you actually want to date them. Because of the way our culture constructs interactions between men and women when you find a man you think is charming, intelligent or fun to hang out with you are attracted to him.  If he is straight, single, and local, the idea of \"making a move\" becomes an immediate possibility and you have to decide if it is something you really want. Gay men, not so much. \n* Many gay men are more feminine than straight men, this isn't just a stereotype, it's a cultural phenomenon. If you are in contact with a large LGBTQ community you will hear multiple instances of people who like twinks mistakenly hitting on butches or vice versa. When I was young I used to fantasize a lot about elves from the works of  Tolkien, who would match a lot of the criteria of \" have legs, a feminine figure, long hair\". When you aren't sure how to imagine yourself with a woman, the idea of a man who seems more like a woman is sometimes a close second and if the idea of being \"the woman\" in a hetero relationship makes you want to vomit, the idea of a guy who has only been with men before can be pleasant. \n* You might find that homosexuality in general feels \"right\" to you. I was also super into m/m fanfic and still occasionally fantasize about being a guy with a guy or watch gay porn. I find the romance between gay men heartwarming in a way I just don't when I see straight couples do the same thing. I am still 100% confident I have no interest in men in this universe, but fantasies are a whole different ball game. \n\nI hope this helps. The first three are very much behind me now, but a \"crush\" on a gay friend of mine was like the dying scream of my comphet before it really started to fade away so I understand a lot of what you experience.

For example, are you turned on by the D/s dynamic but what you really want to be the Dom, not the sub? Or is there a part of what you are doing you like but something else you don't? For example, if your partner is tying you up and calling you a slut do you like the feeling of being tied up but not degradation? You mention being told what to do, do you enjoy playing out that dynamic but actually want a lot of input into what he tells you to do?\n\nWhat does defence mode actually look like? Is it an impulse to push back? In that case, do you actually want to be a bit of a brat or try some primal play? Do you want your partner to show you that he can make you submit? Or is it a feeling of guilt about what you want? Are you scared? Nervous? \n\nAre you worried that the dynamic will bleed into other parts of your relationship, one thing that really helped me with that was taking on very \"high concept\" roles. For example, when I do CNC my girlfriend and I roleplay as a pirate and her prisoner or something similar. It helps make it feel like a \"game\".  Another thing that does that for me is just generally making the whole thing \"not too serious\" so if I am being a brat and she says \"who's in charge\" I will give the most ridiculous answer I can think of.  I roll my eyes and say \"FINE\" whilst doing as I'm told. Stick out my tongue. That kind of thing. \n\nIf you are worried about the scene feeling non-feminist I recommend my \"Say Yes to The Dress Theory\"  I find the assertion that BDSM is somehow the most super awesome feminist thing ever just doesn't feel true for me. However, I do know that it is definitely no more anti-feminist than watching Say Yes to The Dress. i.e if it relaxes you and you enjoy it, then it is fine. Not every breath you take needs to be feminist activism. But you might find unpicking it helps you to enjoy it in a more healthy way and helps you find a way of doing it you enjoy.  And talk to your partner about his feelings in that area too. \n\nPersonally, I find that if \"my mind is telling me no and my body is telling me yes\" my mind is actually telling me \"great first draft but this is going to need work before we move forward.
