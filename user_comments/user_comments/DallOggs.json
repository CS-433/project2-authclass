Working for an international law firm with a common law JD should be possible, but Germans also get common law LLMs and such, and come with the additional advantage of speaking German. In my experience, when an American says he/she is conversational in a language, this does not usually indicate a level of proficiency sufficient for professional contexts. If you are, and you get good marks and maybe an international internship or exchange in your JD, you should be ok. If not, good idea to work on your German.\n\n2. Studying law in Germany will require excellent German, and many years. Studying law in another EU country could be better. Once you have an EU law degree, you are technically eligible to sit the bar exams for any EU jurisdiction (you will need to do some self-study of course). To speed things up, you could do the Master in Economic Law at Sciences Po (assuming you have a good enough CV to get in). This is two years, and is in English. Then you self-study and sit the German bar exam. Know a Belgian lawyer who did this. \n\n3. Academia will be tricky but possible. A JD is not an academic degree, so adds little to your attractiveness from a European standpoint. Similarly, a Bachelor won\u2019t generally be sufficient to gain admission to a good PhD in Europe. PhD positions are essentially like jobs in Europe, they generally require a (research) Masters and some research publications. \n\n\nIf I were you, I\u2019d do the most prestigious American JD you can, work like hell on your Deutsch, do an exchange semester to a good German uni, and then you might look attractive to an international law firm or even as an in-house to a big company, as someone who could sort of translate common law stuff into things Germans will understand.
