It's not so much a syllable problem as where you put the stress on the word. Americans stress the first syllable, you stressed the second.\n\n\"Hawkins\" too was a little off. You put too much stress on \"Haw\" in my opinion. I would've put equal stress on both \"haw\" and \"kins\". \n\nFor \"fairly\", we say it more like \"fehr-lee\" or \"fair-lee\" (same pronunciation, different transcription).\n\n\"Author's\" was a little off too. The way you pronounced it is like \"aWE-thor-s\", instead of \"Awe-thors\". It's hard to put in writing, but I think you rounded your lips too much.
