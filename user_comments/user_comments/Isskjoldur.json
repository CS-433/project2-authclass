Some people don\u2019t have the privilege of a family who can teach them how to look after themselves - and this spirals into the next generation and into the next.

And this can start well before a diagnosis. Sometimes being fat is a symptom, not the disease. \n\nNot to mention mental health which can cause people to binge eat as their brains chase the dopamine. Lots are done for people who are anorexic, but not enough is done for people who binge eat. It *is* an eating disorder, it *is* dangerous in the long run, and not enough is done about it (maybe because it takes longer to \u201ceffect\u201d people). \n\nSo whilst I agree more needs to be done to tackle obesity, it needs to start much earlier than you\u2019re suggesting.

Emotional cheating is still cheating, and that\u2019s what I believe you\u2019ve done here. But that is always a risk of opening yourself up to other people. Do I think you deliberately done it? No. I also think you spoke to your gf once you realised. \n\nOnto the issue of what you should do - it\u2019s honestly entirely up to yourself. It now sounds like you want an open relationship with both women that includes and emotional and sexual component. It sounds like your current partner wouldn\u2019t mind that arrangement either (as assumably she knows your currently in a relationship). The issue is it sounds like your GF only wanted to open up your sex life, not your emotional one. You can talk to her about it, and see if she\u2019s willing to try an emotional OR. Don\u2019t push her, just talk. If not, you then need to decide who you like more and break up with the other one. I would also tell your current partner what is happening if you haven\u2019t as communication is very very important. \n\nI don\u2019t envy your position, just don\u2019t fuck about with them.

My credit score (using Experian) dropped to around the 600 range. I\u2019ve managed to get it up to 968 which I feel great about. \n\nThis is what worked for me - I am the type of person who needs to see results which is difficult month to month as it takes time. I still wanted to be able to do things, so it took me longer than it needed to so you could achieve this quicker than I did. \n\n\u2022 I started by paying off the smallest loans first, and paying just above the minimum for my credit cards (so if the minimum was \u00a335, I\u2019d pay \u00a350). This helped keep me motivated too!\n\n\u2022 Once these were paid off, I cut up the cards but left the account open. This helped improve my score enough to find 0% payment cards with roughly 1.5-2% on balance transfers. I consolidated as much of my credit cards as I could. I done this even if it only gave me the card for 4 months, and just before I gained interest I would change it again. \n\n\u2022 This raised my credit score enough that I got an unsecured consolidation loan with Admiral where I borrowed \u00a33k and paid back \u00a33.2k. \n\n\u2022 My final payment will be in may, and I will then pay off the last \u00a31k left on a credit card. \n\nI would reevaluate your credit score every 3 months or so - and have a light search to see if there\u2019s anything available to you. \n\nCut out what you can (gym memberships are a bitch for it) and if you want to pay it off quickly, consider an evening job for a few hours. Just watch though if you do do that, because your tax free amount might switch to your lowest income!\n\nBeing in debt sucks, folk underestimate how much of a toll it can take on your mental health. Pay this off as quickly as you can, but maybe try and save a little bit to still enjoy yourself. \u00a310k is a lot of money to pay off quickly - if it takes you a few years that\u2019s okay imo, as long as you\u2019re okay.\n\nAnd well done for asking for advice, it takes a lot of guts to do it!

If you\u2019re born in Scotland, or you\u2019ve moved here and lived here, generally we would see you as Scottish - you\u2019ve experienced living with us and become part of us. (Racism however does exist, so there will be the arsehole that say \u2018go back to where you came from\u2019 to a POC whose family has lived here for generations).\n\nI think therein kinda lies the issue? Like, I think most Irish/Scottish-Americans that we tend to feel defensive towards are the ones who are arseholes. I\u2019ve had quite a few bad experiences with them myself. They claim it loudly for superiority, or they try to identify with a Scotland from hundreds of years ago instead of the modern day one (think Outlander). \n\nI\u2019ve always said that if anyone wants to learn about Scotland and our modern day culture, the things that make us Scottish from our issues to our celebrations then I will happily talk for days on end to someone about it. But all it takes is a couple rotten apples to spoil the barrel, and we get our backs up. \n\nI\u2019ve spoken to lots of Scottish-Americans though, and it\u2019s we super interesting for me too. Learning about the diasporas that exist throughout America and the traditions they\u2019ve kept up is fascinating.\n\nIf you appreciate Scotland and what we have here, if you want to get in touch with your roots, as long as you are not insulting then we won\u2019t care.

Celebrate St. Andrew\u2019s day, and put up a flag and do whatever it is you want to do that makes you feel like your connecting with your heritage. You wanna speak Scottish Gaelic? Go for it! You wanna learn Scots? Just avoid the wiki and get a dictionary. Hell, do that even if you don\u2019t have Scottish ancestry and just like Scotland! Just don\u2019t tell me you\u2019re more Scottish than me, don\u2019t boil us down to Outlander, and don\u2019t dismiss the struggles we face, and don\u2019t tell me you\u2019re a descendant of William Wallace. \n\nSorry, I went on a bit of a ramble there.

You pretty much have the same views as my own mother, so I understand where you\u2019re coming from. \n\nYou said it\u2019s unfair to the child not to give it life. If I can\u2019t afford to have a child, and fall pregnant. If I don\u2019t want and can\u2019t love a child. How is that fair to the child? What kinda life is that giving it? Now you could use the argument about putting it up for adoption if I didn\u2019t want it, but there are so many other children waiting to be adopted. And the foster system isn\u2019t reliable - the amount of people who have grown up in it that have horror stories is beyond believable (imo, there should be zero stories like this) so I don\u2019t believe that argument is viable.\n\nIn cases of rape? Neither the mother nor the baby should have to live with that. \n\nYou made the point about bacteria. Well to that I say you are correct - there are single celled organisms that are alive with one cell. But those are complete as one cell. Humans are not and so I would say it is incomparable. The way we do it now is fair I believe - if life wouldn\u2019t be viable outside the womb, it\u2019s not a life. There are also foetuses that make it pretty much to the end of the pregnancy and for no real reason die in the womb and are still born. \n\nYou also spoke it flinching in pain and moving to get comfortable. But nerves have a lot to do with that too. It\u2019s an automatic reaction. If you pour salty soy sauce over a freshly dead octopus it still squirms. Cut the head off a chicken and it\u2019ll still run. \n\nThen (and for me, the most important point) there is the argument of what a women is allowed to do with her body. If you are a mother yourself, you will understand how pregnancy changes a body - not just chemically or mentally but how it physically shifts your insides too. The strain it puts on the body. There\u2019s also the birth where, if it goes well, the risk of death is still much higher than it should be this day and age. If it goes badly you can be damaged for life. \n\nNo one can truly determine the point of life for a foetus so, imo, we shouldn\u2019t be basing it on that. What we do know, and what we can work with, is when it is viable outside the womb which most abortion laws are already based on. \n\nI\u2019m 26 and I don\u2019t want children. I don\u2019t want to bring them into a world so fucked up. I want to get rid of my uterus and ovaries (maybe donate them to someone who needs one) but they won\u2019t allow me to. Too young, might change my mind. Maybe we should be focusing on what women are and aren\u2019t allowed to do with their bodies, maybe we should fight for better sexual education. Then maybe we\u2019d see less abortions and less children in the care of the state. Then maybe we\u2019d see happier women who feel safer and valued.
