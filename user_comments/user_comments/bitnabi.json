[{"author": "bitnabi", "body": "I'm the kind of person who doesn't say anything if there's nothing to be said. This makes small talk types of conversations and phone conversations annoying for me where I have to force myself to make little responses just so the other person can tell I'm listening, unlike in person where it is more obvious that I'm listening. Sometimes it's still a struggle in person. Anyway, a voice note is something I can listen to in my own time. The person can get off their chest what they wanted to say in that moment, and I can listen when I'm good and ready. If the voice note is too long I get a bit annoyed, but tbh, it's actually easier for me to just listen to it while I'm doing something else, than having to read walls and walls of text.\n\nI also try not to send ones that are too long. There was a time where 2 friends and I, who are very far apart now but used to be very close, with all a similar aversion to communicating via text and phone calls, would send each other life updates via voice note. The longest one was about 40 minutes. Not sustainable at all, and we stopped after that, probably about 6 voice notes were sent altogether in total. But it was nice briefly. It's like a podcast, but it's a friend you love. I liked that a lot. Very hard to keep up with though, hense why we didn't. \n\nThese days I only really send voice notes to people who send them to me, which is just my brother.", "created_utc": "1666887563.0", "edited": "False", "id": "iu07y0p", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_yeotn5", "parent_id": "t3_yeotn5", "score": "1", "subreddit": "AskUK", "subreddit_id": "t5_2t4s3"}, {"author": "bitnabi", "body": "You're welcome!

I did that thing people do in cartoons where they rub their eyes because they think they're seeing things. No, really, 3 glowing orbs, moving at a very strange, slow pace, in a line, one after the other. I was always a logical person, but my brain could not find an explanation for this. I had goosebumps. I ran into the living room to get my mum to come and see, but it was late and she'd had a drink, so she was passed out. I went back to my bedroom window. One of the orbs had started to crumble, but on they went, until they were out of sight. That stayed with me for years. It was bone chilling. What the fuck was I looking at right now? I seriously thought about aliens. Well, years later, I read an article in a newspaper about how a Chinese New Year lantern crumbled and landed on someone causing them burns. Then suddenly I remembered that night. That's what those must have been.\n\nSecond, around the age of 13, we had made a new friend. She lived in the neighbourhood between mine and my other friend's. She was always covered in bruises. Turns out her parents were abusive to her and only her out of their 3 kids. They would take the other two out and lock her in the house. One such day, we decided we were going to break her out. She had run away to my friend's house a few times, and my friend's mum called the police and social services, but it didn't seem to me like they were helping her. I can't really remember how we got her out that day but I feel like we helped her get out of the 1st floor window? Anyway, escape successful, we spent the rest of the summer day and evening playing out, carefree. \n\nEventually, she went off somewhere, maybe with a boy? I don't remember, but I guess she didn't go home. I do remember that nether me nor my other friend actually knew where she'd gone at the time, just that she'd gone. It was night, and we walked down a street over from hers. We see her dad. He recognises us and begins to shout. He couldn't speak much English, but we understood that he was asking where his daughter was. We tried to shout back that we didn't know where she was, and as he got closer, we saw a flash at his chest. The light from the streetlights had reflected off a huge kitchen knife that he'd just taken out from inside his jacket. I was always known for being a slow runner, and my friend one of the fastest, but I can tell you that I have never ran so fast in my entire life. It was like I couldn't even feel my legs at all and I somehow managed to run in stride with my friend, the fast one, who was also running for her life. It was absolutely terrifying. I'm not even sure if he chased us, because we just ran and didn't look back. \n\nWe turned into an estate we sometimes hung out on, told the boys there what just happened, and they all reached into a front garden and pulled out poles, planks etc and went looking for him. That was also quite a surreal thing to see, I remember that vividly. I don't know what happened after that other than my friend and I went home. I don't think those boys found him. We never told any adults about it partly because we weren't even supposed to be hanging out around there and our mums would definitely tighten our curfues, but also I think we just didn't really process what really happened, or how else it could have ended. Why did he bring out a knife in the first place? Was it for our friend? Or was it for us, knowing it was probably those two new girls hanging around who helped her again? Was he going to stab us? With all the adrenaline, we laughed it off and didn't talk about it again. I don't think we ever spoke to that girl again, either.

We were allowed to run a bit ahead of my aunt (her mum), but we were always to wait for the green man. We did just that, but some arsehole driver in an otherwise empty lane wasn't watching the lights. I think it turned out that he'd dropped his phone or something and bent down to pick it up. Anyway, my cousin was already halfway across when I saw him. I was a bit behind and ran back, but I didn't call out to her because she was the type of girl who would stop in the middle of the street if you did. And somehow my little brain was confident in that split second that she'd make it all the way across in time if I let her be. He JUST missed her. The entire thing was horrific. I was in shock the rest of the day, she was unphased being only 4, my older brother, 10, who had hung back to walk with my auntie, was a mess, crying and having what I think now was a panic attack, my auntie also a mess but trying to keep it together. After that, we always had to hold onto the buggy and got shouted at if we let go. \n\nSo.

If they're Italian tomatoes I'm guessing they need a hotter climate, so we probably don't grow them locally. Either America does somewhere, since it's an entire continent of differing climates, or, due to the huge Italian population, imports them in big numbers since they'll be used a lot, driving the costs down and allowing every pizzaria in the country to use them as ingredients for this one specific pizza.\n\nI also want to add that, although you keep insisting that the UK should do it the same as the Americans because they do it as the Italians do, many Italians from Italy would argue (and do argue lol) that American pizza is not at all like Italian pizza.

It minimises the legitimacy of the culture in question and this leads to further dehumanisation of the people. A good example of this is how dreadlocs are often appropriated by a subset of people who allow their hair to become an unwashed smelly mess, smoke weed all day, lazy etc etc. You know the type. In reality, most black people with dreadlocs have very clean hair because the locs suit the hair type, not washing it isn't needed, and whether they smoke weed or not has nothing to do with how they look. Yet people will make assumptions about them and associate them with this specific group of hippies. I cannot get locs (which would be a perfect way of keeping my hair neat and out of the way) or people assume I live a certain lifestyle, and they do not treat me the same way. I've been approached by idiots asking if I want to buy weed or if I have any to sell. People ask me if I like reggae and shout \"ya mon\" at me on the street. I've also been told not to wear them to a job I had in a high fashion retail and I wondered after they told me that if they would even have given me the job had I worn them in the interview. My own secondary school put out a notice that students were not allowed to wear their hair in locs or braids and called them \"trendy hairstyles\" and likened them to makeup. They're not trendy, it's just hair! The pictures they used as examples were all of black hair. \n\nAnyway, as you can see this issue is quite close to my heart.

Another layer is added if the people wearing kilts for fashion/etc are also engaging in socially undesirable behaviour while doing so, such as hardcore raving and drug taking. The kilts then become associated with this behaviour and it would further negatively affect Scotsmen in their daily lives.

She wasn't a complete Jay in that I don't think she lied about everything all the time, but she did give one huge lie. This was in year 9, so we were 13/14. She had us all convinced that her dad was dead. Us (her best friends), classmates, the entire year knew this about her. If someone said \"your dad!\" to her she would burst into angry tears. Another one of our group's mum had actually died of cancer and she never ever talked about it but we all knew it was of course an extremely sore topic for her. This girl went out of her way to comfort the other girl and give her advice on how to deal with it. \n\nLater, maybe half a year later? Another of our group went to her house and the girl began showing off new photos on her wall she'd had printed. One was of her and her dad, and she implied it was recent. When questioned, she quickly said \"Oh, I mean, you know, before he passed away.\" This went on for another half a year and it was becoming more and more obvious to the two of us (me and the girl who went to her house) that something was not right. She slipped up quite a few times. So one day, the other girl straight up asks her mum. Her mum was confused. Her dad isn't dead, he lives in Italy. He's alive and well. What were we on about?\n\nThe fallout from that was intense. The girl who asked her mum confronted her and she said that she wished he was dead. Of course everyone found out after. The girl whose mum had passed away had some kind of panic attack meltdown when she found out. The liar never bounced back from that, she left shortly after.", "created_utc": "1661726717.0", "edited": "1661727796.0", "id": "im6q00q", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_x02ng3", "parent_id": "t3_x02ng3", "score": "7", "subreddit": "AskUK", "subreddit_id": "t5_2t4s3"}, {"author": "bitnabi", "body": "I think as long as you are understandable then it's fine.

He and my mum lived with her for the first 2 years of his life, and after that was in the house all the time (my mum worked, my nan babysat). There was always a tonne of people in my nan's house, my aunts' and uncles' friends and her neighbours etc. So my brother only ever really heard two forms of address for my nan: Mum and her name. His baby brain was able to figure out that she's not his mum, so mum isn't what he should call her. So he went with her name. My nan was quite young at the time and nan/nanny/nana etc made her feel old so she never corrected him. I came along and did the same baby reasoning: this woman is my mum's mum, so I don't call her mum, but my brother and everyone else calls her by her name, so that's what I'll do.\n\nMy cousin who is a year and a half younger also calls her that. Our next cousin is in an awkward spot. She was raised by her parents to say \"nanny\" and they were very strict about it, but she also feels weird saying that around us older grandkids. Most of the time she simply says nothing at all lol but she will call her nanny when referring to her if she really has to say something. Everyone that came next calls her \"nanny\" because 4th grandchild (the one just mentioned) lived with our nan and so when the kids were being babysat, 4th GC would always say to them \"give that to nanny\" etc.\n\nSo the eldest three call her by her name, we call her nan when talking to people who don't know her, and all over 10+ grandkids call and refer to her as nanny.\n\nEdit to add: I also noticed that my mum's siblings will often say to me (at a party for example) \"Where's [her name]?\" instead of \"Where's my mum?\" or \"Where's nanny?\", the latter is what they would say to the kids (and also what we would all say to the youngest kids).

The ending here is \uc544/\uc5b4\uc694. What's being added in between the verb and the ending is (\uc73c)\uc2dc. This is an honorific. It's honouring the listener. Basically, it's adding more politeness. It's used in imperatives and questions. When the \uc2dc is added to \uc544/\uc5b4\uc694 it becomes \uc138\uc694.\n\nSo \uc544/\uc5b4\uc694 can be a plain sentence or it can be a question.

The \uc2dc is added because you are asking someone to do something and it's similar to the difference between \"give me that\" and \"can you give me that please?\"\n\nAn example of this with another ending can be seen clearly in \uc548\ub155\ud558\uc138\uc694 vs \uc548\ub155\ud558\uc2ed\ub2c8\uae4c.

We say \"What year are you in?\" and reply with \"Year X\" where the X is a number.\n\nForm is not related to year/grade at all (anymore, see next paragraph). At school, my brother and I were in the same form, but different years. Another word for form is house, and you can look at Harry Potter as a famous example.\n\nThe only exception is Sixth Form, which refers to years 12 to 13, which can also be the college years (pre-University, in America I guess this would be high school). The reason why it is sixth FORM is because before numbered years were introduced, forms referred to these years instead. Sixth Form is treated like a separate part of the school (some don't even have them) and so I guess it just stuck even after the others changed (1st Form -> Year 7).\n\nAt uni, for some reason it changed to \"What year are you?\" to which the reply would be \"I'm a first year (student).\" I'm not really sure why the difference. Maybe because in British schools it's really rare for anyone to repeat a year or be a year behind, but in university it's actually pretty common. So if I was actually at uni for 3 years but hadn't made it to the 3rd year classes I would say \"I'm a 3rd year, but I'm redoing 2nd year.\" Or if I had been there 3 years but did a foundation year to start with (usually for art degrees) I would say \"2nd year but I did foundation.\" Both answers are basically telling the listener what stage they're at in completing their degree, while also saying how long they've been at the uni, because saying what year student you are doesn't necessarily say how long you've been there or what classes you're in.

If the final syllable ends in a consonant, you add \uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. If it ends in a vowel, you add \u3142 to the final syllable and then follow with \ub2c8\ub2e4.\n\n\uc788\ub2e4 means to exist or to have.

Thanks for the tips, I'm definitely going to do this!\n\nI'm also going to switch my animal crossing to Korean, and I'm trying pokemon sword again as I found the English text too simple the first time and it bored me (gameplay was fun as always but I felt like I was watching a toddler's cartoon, probably an exaggeration). It occurred to me that rather than boring it would be challenging and fun in Korean so I'm giving that a try. So far I understand enough for it to be a challenge but not frustrating. Might get more difficult later when the villain goes on an inevitable rant about their ambitions lol\n\nEdit: oh and thank you for the Pedro's journey recommendation. I'm not learning Spanish but I am going to check it out anyway to see how games like this can work!", "created_utc": "1650459540.0", "edited": "False", "id": "i5h4six", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_u5mop3", "parent_id": "t1_i5h2b82", "score": "2", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "bitnabi", "body": "I think among experts and over achievers in any field, you'll find many neurodivergent people who deal with hyperfixations and special interests.

I have it, but I haven't used it much yet because it turns out learning from vocab lists this way doesn't really work for me. The words are organised by category (eg. People) and then sub category (eg. Family, emotions). They're then listed alphabetically, and have an example sentence each. \n\nI also have Vitamin Korean 1 and 2 and these books also work well. VK is a textbook course. They provide grammar points and lots of vocab based on themes per chapter. They aren't very detailed on the grammar explanations, but that's okay because KGIU is. VK has quite a lot of activities to practice the grammar and vocab learned. I like checking out what grammar the chapter introduces and learn about those in KGIU first. Then I go through the related chapters in VK and it's good because it feels like a simple refresher with some more practice. \n\nVK doesn't have every grammar point that shows up in KGIU, but it has most of them, and the first two books cover KGIU Beginner.

Instead I am making notes that generate cards for the grammar point itself and 1-2 example sentences. That's the short version. \n\nThe long version in case it helps anyone:\n\nSo far I've made two note types for this but I'll probably need to make more for different types or grammar. I have a note type for sentence endings and other types of suffixes, and I have a note type for verbs/adjectives (the two behave the same in Korean and both end in \ub2e4, the \ub2e4 is dropped when conjugating/adding suffixes.)\n\nMy ending notes produce a card with the grammar point in its unconjugated form on the front and on the back are some very condensed notes describing the rules. I then almost always use the same verb, \ud558\ub2e4 (to do) + the grammar point + \uc694 speech level (the most common polite speech level). Sometimes I also use \uba39\ub2e4 for when a consonant ending makes a difference. For example:\n\nOn the front: (\uc73c)\u3139 \uac83\uc774\ub2e4\n\nOn the back: \n\nA/V + future tense + \uc774\ub2e4 ((I have another note about \uc774\ub2e4))\n\n\uac83 -> \uac70\n\n\ud560 \uac70\uc608\uc694\n\n\uba39\uc744 \uac70\uc608\uc694\n\nI treat this card as if I'm just going over some notes. Some are a little longer than this but I make sure to read it all. If the notes aren't enough and I'm confused then I go back to the page in my textbook and try to re-understand it, and maybe fix my notes if necessary.\n\nOn the same note, I have fields for a couple of sentence examples, a picture for each and audio for each. I get the audio and sentences from my textbook and I find the pics myself. I treat this like an immersion card. Sentence (with grammar point bolded), audio and picture on the front, grammar point on the back. I make sure one sentence is in \uc694 form and one is in \ub2c8\ub2e4 form (formal and polite). Sometimes this means no audio from my book if I had to change the speech level myself but I think it's important to see the difference. As seen above the \uc694 form of \uac83\uc774\ub2e4 is \uac70\uc608\uc694 and the \ub2c8\ub2e4 version is \uac81\ub2c8\ub2e4. For these cards, I just want to make sure I understand what the grammar point is doing. If I can't remember, I open the original note and check the notes I wrote. So far this is working out better for me than cloze.\n\nFor verbs and adjectives, it is similar. I have a card for the dictionary form (for example, \ud558\ub2e4), and one or two sentences. The word card is just like my other vocab cards - word on the front with audio, picture on the back. The sentence cards are more like immersion cards. I either make my own or I pull them from forvo with audio, or naver dictionary without. Maybe a song lyric (which I denote with a music symbol, to keep in mind that Korean lyrics are often not grammatically correct). I have the sentence, audio and picture on the front. The back shows me the dictionary form. I make sure the sentences conjugate the word differently. For example: \n\n\ub9f5\ub2e4 (to be spicy) \n\n\ub108\ubb34 \ub9e4\uc6cc\uc694 (very/too spicy) \n\n\uc774 \uc74c\uc2dd\uc740 \ub9f5\uc9c0\ub9cc \uc88b\uc544\ud574\uc694 (this food is spicy but I like it) \n\nI write a simple diary every day or two in Korean. For practicing verb/adjective conjugations, I write down the ones that come up in my anki session on a sticky note. When writing the diary, I try to use the words wherever natural. For example the other day the words \"to be close\" \"to be cheap\" and \"to buy\" came up, and that day I had gone to the corner shop that's close to my house. So I made sure to write about it. If it doesn't work naturally, I'll just practice making a few sentences with different conjugations off the top of my head at the bottom of my diary entry. I'm thinking about making a randomiser for which conjugations to use later, but for now it's fine.\n\nIf anyone read all of that... Well done lol. I think it might seem more complicated and extra when I explain it, but it works clearly in my mind and in practice. I imagine I'll continue to make changes to it as I learn more but for now it's working quite well.

When talking to strangers, teachers, colleagues, elders, you use \uc800. When talking to your friends, people younger than or same age as you, your parents, or yourself you use \ub098. Little kids often use \ub098 to anyone until they learn about polite language. \n\nWhen you use \uc800, you are humbling yourself and lifting up the listener, when you use \ub098, you are putting the listener on a lower or the same level as yourself. \n\nI don't know if duolingo shows you both, but if so, you might notice that when using \ub098, there is usually no special sentence ending. When using \uc800, there is always a polite and/or formal sentence ending. In your example, it's \uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. They often end in \ub2c8\ub2e4 or \uc694. \n\nHope that helped!

But even in English small talk bores me to tears.\n\nIt was worth a try, though, and I found I was better at Korean than I thought I was which was a nice confidence boost. You can find people who are also absolute beginners of English (well, I don't think there are many *absolute* beginners of English in Korea because they are exposed to it in school, but many are out of practice and are like false beginners) and practice what you learn with them and the conversation level should stay achievable.\n\nAnd then you can always just take a break to study further before trying again. That's what I'm doing currently.

There's also pushback against the claims from some women who insist they *are* keeping up anyway, but are still looked over in favour of their male peers. A third issue I've seen pushback against is that women should get some extra sick day allowance for periods - this particular issue is hardly talked about anywhere in the world at the moment to be really honest. The points against it is that all workers should be just allowed to take their sick days, as currently they are discouraged from doing so, but the point for it is that women get periods always, on top of also falling ill like men do. \n\nThese are just three examples because we could be here all day and I really don't have much of a foundation to go any further than what I've already said, but to me these are reasonable issues to discuss.

I mean, I know the answer from a politician's point of view: division is so helpful when campaigning. But I wish people could just... multitask... I guess?\n\nFrom my western perspective, and just personally, I think mandatory military service for men is also a feminist issue in that feminism should seek for an end to discrimination based on gender and feminine traits. The idea that men must always be super masculine strong fighters is also detrimental to society. Sure, many men benefit from the idea, but a lot suffer from it. So, it confuses me greatly that the answer to \"we want to not be discriminated against for being women\" is \"well WE have to join the army by force so shut up\" because... If women were not discriminated against I guess everyone would all be going to the army like some other countries do (though there are still levels of gender discrimination there too... I don't think there's anywhere without it). Or if it was abolished then no one would be forced to go.

If you need another representation of the sounds for help, IPA is good. Also search through this sub for \"aspirated\" consonants. There are so many good explanations of the differences between Korean consonants vs the ones found in European languages that so far I haven't see explained as thoroughly in a textbook. In particular, regarding voiced and voiceless sounds, in comparison to aspiration. I didn't understand how to even start to differencieate between the consonants until I read the comments on this sub. Now that I understand the concept, I'm having a much easier time.\n\nTo really answer your question, I would say that from my understanding, Korean has a wider range of what consonant sounds are to native English speakers. Romanisation does its best to approximate the sounds but falls short because in this example, we have only t and d and they are different based on how they are voiced - t is voiceless (no vibration) and d is voiced (vibration). Korean has 3 consonants on the same spectrum that make no such distinction. Instead it's about the aspiration, or how much air is expelled when saying the letter at the start of the syllable. Similarly, aspiration makes no difference to English consonants. So romanisation has a hard job here and has to instead find a way to differencieate between \u3137 and \u314c. \u314c never sounds like a D, so let's make it a T. That leaves D for \u3137, because it sounds a little softer I suppose. I've seen \u3138 romanised as tt and dd and that's just... Even more confusing. \n\nSo, really, throw away romanisation from the start. It will only hinder you. (And search the sub for more explanation on aspirated consonants. I'm just relating the info as I understand it and ultimately left a lot to be desired and could have understood it wrong.)", "created_utc": "1647183593.0", "edited": "False", "id": "i0hxbgz", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_td7en3", "parent_id": "t3_td7en3", "score": "21", "subreddit": "Korean", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rd8q"}, {"author": "bitnabi", "body": "I'm trying out a schedule now. I've got vitamin Korean and KGIU. I've mapped out which grammar points in VK are covered in KGIU and organised them so that I can study them around the same time. There's also a review list of vocab (and grammar but I just take the vocab) at the end of each chapter of VK and I've been taking those words and making flashcards out of them. I find the grammar points a little lacking in explanation in VK but there are so many practice questions. KGIU lacks practice but goes very in depth on the grammar points.\n\nSo, before I start a chapter I will cover the grammar and go over the vocab for a few days (with spaced repetition) so that I'm familiar enough to get good usage out of the practice questions in VK.\n\nBefore this, I would just grind some random vocab when I felt like it, then when tired of that grind some chapters of KGIU... In the end its been difficult to tie it all together - I am familiar with a lot of grammar but I don't know many situations to use them in, a know random bits of vocab but hardly anything I'll need to use at this level or to make complete sentences. So, I'm hoping this way will be more of a structured comprehensive way to tie all the elements of study together.\n\nThere are some grammar points in KGIU beginner that are not covered in VK at all, but I've made a note of that and will complete them all (and find my own practice for those) before moving onto the intermediate books for VK and KGIU. I'll also add in vocab I find in the wild to my anki deck so that I'm not only learning textbook vocab.\n\nThere are some other darakwon textbooks I want to add into the mix, like listening skills and speaking skills. I think for those two I will just go through a couple of chapters each a week or so when I feel like it. I don't think they need to be tied in so closely with the other two books. But I'll see!\n\nEdit: I forgot to say how frequently I study. I do it when I feel like it but I would say that amounts to a couple of hours 4-6 days a week. I do a few days, naturally take a day off or two, do another few days. I do the flashcards almost every night though, or they start to pile up and that's no fun.", "created_utc": "1647167789.0", "edited": "False", "id": "i0h8n86", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_tcvvut", "parent_id": "t3_tcvvut", "score": "3", "subreddit": "Korean", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rd8q"}, {"author": "bitnabi", "body": "I also mess this up when having conversations even though I could write it down separately with no problems.

Koreans don't have to avoid or hide their culture in Korea. In somewhere where they are the minority and are likely to suffer racism because of their cultural expression, they might. That's why cultural appropriation is a thing that is talked about. When the majority class or race of a country partakes in the culture of a minority, in a way that wasn't shared by them but rather taken from them, where the person from the majority wouldn't experience discrimination for their cultural identity (because it isn't your cultural identity) but the minority would... That's cultural appropriation regardless of intention. \n\nSo of course where you wear a hanbok makes a difference depending on the context of the society you're in. And this idea of what you wear being perceived differently depending on where you are isn't exclusive to cultural appropriation at all. It's like how you can wear a bikini on the beach but not in the middle of new york city or, idk, a school.\n\nIf you bought a hanbok from a Korean designer (best way to go about it since it was shared with you and you didn't get it off somewhere like h&m) and want to wear it around the States one day, well you might get some heckles or weird looks but what do you think a Korean-American might go through their whole life if they freely and openly express their Korean heritage...? And even when they don't do any of that they can experience discrimination simply for their ethnicity. They can't take that off at the end of the day.\n\nI said \"you\" at lot but really these thoughts were just based on your comment, I'm speaking generally.", "created_utc": "1642048286.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hsg3w8u", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_s2agzz", "parent_id": "t1_hsdscmr", "score": "3", "subreddit": "korea", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qiog"}]
