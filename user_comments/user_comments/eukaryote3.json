I don\u2019t think anybody knows the full story, and we likely never will. Shcherbina was somewhat well-suited to politics. The law was a political move. I\u2019m sure he didn\u2019t come up with the decree all by himself. The Soviet Union made some good attempts to relocate people from contaminated areas early on, but in the end, this largely failed and lots of people remained on contaminated land. The Soviet Union was also stressed over energy and their lack of reserves at the time of the accident \u2014 they needed nuclear power, and negative public perception was becoming a threat to its continued development. At the fall of the Soviet Union, lots of people blamed Shcherbina and others for allowing people to live on contaminated land, and they used this decree as evidence against him of a coverup. He absolutely was known to say different things according to who he was taking to. He would tell villagers in contaminated areas they had \u201cnothing to worry about\u201d but then quietly demand via letter they be evacuated. Politics is complicated. \n\nAlso, on a personal note, Shcherbina was extraordinarily stubborn in everything, including his health. When he signed that decree, I don\u2019t believe he ever would\u2019ve thought he\u2019d die of radiation-related illness. He\u2019d overcome illnesses before in his life that doctors told him he wouldn\u2019t be able to beat. I think he viewed radiation the exact same way \u2014 that he could will it away. He was taking some supplement that he believed would ward off radiation. I think he sincerely thought he could will away anything if he tried hard enough. We know it was his heart that killed him and he was coughing nonstop in Armenia, but without any kind of autopsy, we\u2019ll never know for sure if it was radiation-related. Personally, my take is it was radiation that did him in, cesium-137 being incorporated into the muscles in his heart. He was in perfect health before Chernobyl and was physically active, personal fitness was literally a hobby of his, so even though his death was \u201cnormal\u201d given his age, I don\u2019t think it would\u2019ve happened when it did if it hadn\u2019t been for Chernobyl.

A counselor or social worker or even the AP if neither is available should have tried talking to the kid first without the audience of the entire class. I have done exactly this as a counselor multiple times and never has it failed to de-escalate a student and allow the rest of the class to then proceed with the rest of the day as normal. Sometimes the class has to go to another location for a long time, sometimes the kid will willingly walk to another location, but there is always a way of dealing with this kind of shut down without physically forcing a child to the ground and out of the classroom. \n\nOnce the student has calmed down and is talking, give them space. After they have completely de-escalated is when discipline follows. Suspension. Possible long-term suspension. Etc. \n\nThe only reason a child should be thrown to the floor like that is if they have a weapon or are physically attacking another person. She was sitting and shutting down.

IMO, Gorbachev was just scrambling at this point because of Adamovich and the fact he was now concerned a bunch of facilities were about to have major accidents and fatalities.

Legasov had already announced publicly at the time that he did not exonerate the personnel and, above all, the management of the plant from blame, *but he believed that the disaster had been pre-programmed by the reactor design itself.* This was a very bold statement, which caused a storm of indignation among influential scientists involved in the design of this type of nuclear power plant. \n\n\u201cA little later, in a confidential conversation, Legasov told me: \u2018Vitaly Andreyevich, I will be persecuted. *After all, I am writing about the fact that the Chernobyl accident was also the fault of the designers in the report*.\u2019\u201d \n\nAlso, after the Vienna report was reviewed, people immediately called for Legasov to be expelled from the party and punished for revealing state secrets. It was his \u201cbff\u201d Ryzhkov that immediately swooped in and stopped this from happening. Even though you might sit there saying he didn\u2019t go far enough, even with how far he did go, he took an enormous risk. You say it\u2019s not about Vienna, yet the INSAG report is your number one grievance against him.  \n\nWhat do you bring to the comments section besides your feelings, sticks?", "created_utc": "1660708704.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ikm4h7a", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_wq79qi", "parent_id": "t1_ikm39jt", "score": "8", "subreddit": "chernobyl", "subreddit_id": "t5_2twgu"}, {"author": "eukaryote3", "body": "Attacking me personally does not help you prove your points.

He will now sit in his academic chair, not bound by anything \u2013 what to expect from him, the devil himself does not know\u2026.\u201c This is where I first heard of this.

In Belarus, the Institute of Physics was left out, so let\u2019s transfer the safety problems to them\u2026.\u201d \n\nThe Politburo then responded to this: \"The Politburo returned to this topic for a second time, agreed special institute was needed, and that Legasov should head it. But then, again, there were delays: this time, a building was simply not made available. I remember well our last meeting: in my presence, from his office, Valery called Shcherbina\u2019s Central Committee, asking about the premises for the institute. Buildings in Moscow were hard to come by, he was told on the other end of the line. He hung up and said, \u2018You see, everything is pointless. They won\u2019t let me create the institute\u2026.

We have set the date for April 28th, and Shcherbina, the former head of the State Commission, where you used to be a member, will be there too.\u201d\n\nAnyway, as far as actual record of this within the Politburo, look for the notes from May 3, 1988. That's where the best information is. Gorbachev was giving everyone in that meeting a hard time for not addressing nuclear safety adequately, and both Ryzhkov and Ligachev jump on that saying that the safety institute that was to be headed by Legasov was never created, and Ligachev brought up Legasov's suicide and said Soviet science has never had a scientist like him in its entire history and now he's gone, and that the blame for the Chernobyl disaster lies with Soviet science.", "created_utc": "1660425551.0", "edited": "1660428008.0", "id": "ik6cn95", "is_submitter": "True", "link_id": "t3_wmc0gc", "parent_id": "t1_ik68u7a", "score": "3", "subreddit": "chernobyl", "subreddit_id": "t5_2twgu"}, {"author": "eukaryote3", "body": "You're doing it again.

It\u2019s kind of weird because JKR knows how to spin a book plot so well. \n\nBut I\u2019ll do my best: \n1. 5 years is a long time for nothing to really happen. But Dumbledore had a very large drawer full of excuses as to why he couldn\u2019t destroy the blood troth. Now he\u2019s going to have to use even more excuses for another 13 years as to why he can\u2019t find Grindelwald. As for Newt/Tina, I guess Tina is into her career and Newt still hasn\u2019t figured out how to ask a girl on a date. Jacob I guess can\u2019t move on because love is like that. \n\n2. I actually kind of blame the deleted scenes for Yusuf Lama\u2019s mysterious presence and seemingly uselessness. There was a deleted scene of Dumbledore in Nurmengard castle after his duel with Credence (presumably) and I think Kama helped get him in. Maybe he wants revenge against the guy who killed his sister, idk. \n\n3. They had to have the manticore + babies because \u201cfantastic beasts\u201d is still in the title. \ud83d\ude09Also, I\u2019m sure the guard let Newt back there because he thought Newt wouldn\u2019t make it out alive. That\u2019s why he taunts Pickett about Newt saying he\u2019ll be back. \n\n4. Yeah I don\u2019t fully get the title of Supreme Mugwump either, but I am pretty sure that Dumbledore got the title after the defeat of Grindelwald. It\u2019s an old title though, I remember seeing it early on in the books. Wish JKR would clarify better. \n\n5. He\u2019s Apparating/Disapparating.

I have no issue with private schools that don\u2019t take taxpayer money, but I have issues with charter schools who do. This is why: Imagine you have a kid with special needs, whether it be academic, emotional, or behavioral. Charter schools are selling a product to parents. They want to make parents think their child is receiving a high-class education and their child is doing well academically. They also have the ability to deny kids an education. Public schools can do this too, but you basically would have to be an extremely violent individual to be barred from public school altogether. Charter schools can dismiss a kid after five days. Your special needs kid doesn\u2019t do the best academically and cussed out a teacher one day. The charter school doesn\u2019t have to accommodate your kid. It doesn\u2019t matter if your kid has an IEP or a 504. They can say it\u2019s not working out and refer your kid to the public school. Data is available for parents to see, and your kid is dragging down the school. What\u2019s the businesslike thing for them to do? They cut your kid loose. Keep in mind that the charter school is still taking public funds. So now your special needs kid has to go to public school. And let\u2019s say your special needs kid is a huge science nerd, despite all their difficulties, and they want to take an AP Biology class. That\u2019s unfortunate, too many of the \u201csmart kids\u201d who haven\u2019t been kicked out of charter school and who have no IEPs or 504s attend the charter school, so the class doesn\u2019t make because not enough kids signed up for it. Your kid is put into regular Biology. Add this to the fact that charter schools tend to exaggerate where a kid is academically (your child is two grade levels above in math!) when really they\u2019re at grade level. Charter schools are feel good places that take public money, lock out the \u201cundesirables,\u201d keep \u201cthe good ones,\u201d make parents believe their kid is going to be accepted into Yale, and create an invisible segregation by physically pushing the majority of special needs kids into one place and enticing the high achievers to stay away from that same place as the special needs kids due to the difference in educational opportunities.
