She said she would say \u201clet\u2019s go.\u201d I worried about wasting money, student loans plus paying for a visa plus the money she and my brother-in-law spent this last week before I moved in. She said none of that was important though, this was my dream and she encouraged me to stick it out just a bit longer because  it would suck the first few weeks. I\u2019m out of my comfort zone. I\u2019m here for graduate school, so I\u2019m not unaccustomed to being away from home but not an ocean away just a train ride.

After reading the English classics like Jane Eyre or Little Women, there would be French words or phrases sprinkled throughout the text and I was always so fascinated by the spelling or attempting pronunciation. But living in the US, I had more exposure to Spanish. And that\u2019s the language I focused on when it came time to choose in school. (It was also the only language offered at my junior high.)\n  In high school, I had a wider variety of languages to choose from but I think a few things kept me working on Spanish. The first was that I\u2018d already been working on the language for 3 years, so I felt like I should keep going. The second, I don\u2019t remember this fully but I think my vision teachers encouraged me to stick with Spanish. I\u2019m visually impaired and so read and write in braille. Spanish is pretty ubiquitous across the US, so I think most teachers of the visually impaired are familiar with the Spanish braille accent marks. I think they encouraged me to stick with Spanish so that it was less work for them when it came time to transcribe my homework.\n  So I learned Spanish in school for 8 years.\n  I was fairly proficient in reading and writing but struggled when it came to oral communication. Freshman year of college, I decided to take a class focused on improving oral communication. But I had an Argentinian professor whose accent I struggled to understand. I think I ended up hyper focusing to pass the class\u2026 And then relaxed once I was done and forgot everything.\n  I didn\u2019t really do anything with language for the next few years. Occasionally I try to work on Spanish, but I couldn\u2019t find my level, I would either start from the beginning and it would be too simple or jump ahead and things would be too advanced. In the meantime, I took an ancestry test trying to get to the bottom of my French last name when, as far as I\u2019m aware, both sides of my family are from different parts of the English speaking Caribbean. Then I took a trip where I had a layover in Montreal. My friend and I needed assistance from airport staff (were both blind). Likely because of my last and middle names, the staff started speaking to me in French\u2026 It took me a little while to even realize they were talking to me \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2640\ufe0f \n  It would take another few months, but one night I had a flash of inspiration and I was like, Why not try out French?

I want it low angst. Banter is great but not necessarily necessary, especially if it becomes over-the-top. But I also like hurt/comfort, royalty romances, friends to lovers, fake dating\u2026 I just want them to all be relatively low angst.\n  I love seeing characters take care of each other, choose each other, psych themselves out but ultimately communicate about how much they like/want the other. I love watching a character soften toward their partner.\n  I like slice of life stories where I can actually picture than being together, not just lead up then an happily ever after epilogue. I want to know/believe that this couple will make it. That there is depth beneath the banter.\n  Part of it comes from the craziness of the last few years. I\u2019ve been vetting my fantasy more heavily because it can get darker a lot faster than romance. So I found that I\u2019ve been throwing myself into the romance world more fully. I\u2019ve become a lot pickier and less apologetic about just wanting to read people being happy.\n   I\u2019ve also seen a lot of unhealthy relationships in my life  and so I don\u2019t want to read about them in fiction. I think I\u2019m also imagining these cute, communicative romances for myself. Yes there might be a disagreement, but it will make sense. Or it won\u2019t take up most of the book. It will be resolved. There will be cuteness. And all of this is possible for my own life and future romance.\nEdited to add, on the topic of hurt/comfort, I love when there are secret scars. When one character underestimates the other, then can physically see how much they have underestimated them by the trauma of their past written on their skin. I struggle to be emotionally vulnerable in romantic situations, in part because of my upbringing (Mom is probably somewhere on the narcissism spectrum and deadbeat father.) So I like reading about a character opening up and finding comfort in someone. Reading about someone being there when the other person is sick. I want to feel like someone is there for/taking care of me, and I also want to be there for and to take care of someone else in return.\n  I also just like reading about hot men playing hockey.

I haven\u2019t spoken to him about the details of his service yet though.\n  I\u2019m still planning to go the visa route for this coming year because it seems simpler. Then I figured I would begin working out the citizenship details in the coming months. I have also only been to England once, for a short stay. So I\u2019m looking into all of my options, but I feel like I should probably spend some more time over there before pursuing citizenship. I like to do research before hand though, and look at all of my options.\n  I actually just realize that my great grandmother might have been a British citizen.

I have friends who never learned braille either because their parents worried about social stigma or because they themselves worried about social stigma and now they lament not having the best grammar/spelling skills. Some of them are actively working on improving their reading speed/comprehension while others are happy to use spellcheck or have a friend look over particularly important papers. If one of those friends asks me to edit a document, I don't feel I can do an adequate job unless the words are beneath my fingers. Spelling is easy to flag as incorrect, but punctuation isn't always caught (in my experience anyway). I, and many other fellow blind students also needed braille for the maths and sciences. Not digital, but the hard copy stuff for both images and keeping track of formulas. (This isn't always the case for people who have a great memory for that sort of thing).\n  You made a great point about physical labor impacting one's ability to read braille which can be true. Certain conditions also cause people to lose sensitivity. But it's not a blanket problem. I have been reading braille since I was at least five and playing guitar for at least 8 years. I have calluses on my left hand and now the very tips of my fingers aren't quite as sensitive but I can still read with not only the tips but the rest of the pads of my fingers. I have musician friends who can do the same. I've wondered if it helped that I continued to be an avid braille user as I learned. I also have a friend who lost his sight at around 20 who played guitar, bass and I think some sports that definitely caused callused fingers/hands. He decided that he wanted to learn braille and took to it very easily/quickly.\n  The braille vs text-to-speech debate reminds me of the print vs eBook debate (not in the way OP is using audiobooks). EBooks were supposed to be the demise of print and, while it's definitely had an impact, the group of print readers is still going strong. This is specifically about reading books, but also applies to reading a speech or presentation. While I do know some folks who can listen to their piece and recite it back with personality and precision, I also know it's something that not a lot of blind people can do.\n  I didn't plan to write so much, but I really got into my subject matter. I was just planning to link a few things in case you were interested in reading them. A [piece](https://nfb.org/images/nfb/publications/bm/bm17/bm1707/bm170704.htm) from NFB where someone refutes a radio host's claim that braille is becoming obsolete.

I think the quake actually happened in Virginia or North Carolina, but people in NY and NJ felt the aftershocks.\n  I can still visualize that day. Sitting at my computer desk in my old apartment, posting my angsty poetry/life thoughts to Tumblr. Then I felt a couple seconds of movement. It wasn\u2019t like the chair was shaking but that everything was just\u2026 moving. (Not sure if that makes sense.) I\u2019m pretty sure it only lasted a few seconds but it somehow felt like forever and like no time at all. I remember sitting confused for a few seconds before tentatively looking around. Then I ran into the bedroom where my sister was to ask what in the world just happened.\n  Our apartment building was having a bug problem at the time and my sister, who is terrified of bugs remembered our mom talking about seeing a roach \u201cas big as a German sheperd\u201d.

It\u2019s been interesting reading the posts that I could relate to and then second-guessing everything when I couldn\u2019t.\ud83d\ude43\ud83d\ude02\nI recently read a book with a character who had ADHD and the way the author portrayed them made me begin to consider my own habits and responses a bit more. So I\u2019m hoping to get anyone\u2019s thoughts on what could be symptoms.\n\nFocus. I don\u2019t have an issue focusing per se, but I realized that for optimal results I have to be doing more than one thing. A very common example of this is talking on the phone, I might start reading a book and doing something that involves equal attention. This doesn\u2019t happen everytime, but sometimes I don\u2019t even realize I\u2019m doing it. I do think I tune out sometimes but catch enough to still respond and then realize what I\u2019m doing and bring my full attention back to the person. I also used to do this in school.\n\tAs a kid, I had a vivid imagination and would definitely slip off into my head in school and now it kind of feels like I\u2019ve replaced actual daydreaming with books.\n\nForgetfulness. Someone will ask me to do something, and I will walk away to do it, only to be distracted by some fact that I must look up and completely forget about it. This is one I already find myself compensating for though as I\u2019ve gotten better about putting everything in my calendar over the years and making sure my notifications are turned on and setting reminders.\n\nOrganization. I remember being reprimandfed for being disorganized as a kid to which I would always respond that they didn\u2019t understand my system. (To this day I still think that\u2019s true.) I try to be very careful about keeping things in its place (I\u2019m visualy impaired so this is also important so that I know where things are). Unless things have a home, I am definitely prone to forget where I put them. And for chores and things, out of sight is definitely out of mind.\n\nSchool. I made this it\u2019s own little section because it\u2019s a complicated topic for me. I\u2019m really smart, but have always been called and jokingly referred to myself as smart but lazy. With the exception of high school though, there were almost always extenuating circumstances impacting my mental health and motivation. But I also realized, when I tried and failed taking this online course last year that I don\u2019t really have study habits. Switching to online was already a struggle and again, there was a whole pandemic and stressful home situation. But I realized that I didn\u2019t really have any study habits. I often did well in college though because I was able to study in cafes or other areas that had a low-level distraction built in for the background noise. (This was always something I expressed to my mom and teachers when they said I shouldn\u2019t do my homework with the TV on.) But I would either read everything immediately, or procrastinate hard.\n\nHyperfocus. This is the only one that I don\u2019t think has a qualifier. I can get REALLY invested in a subject that interests me. Googling and regoogling to make sure I have every bit of information.\n\tMy sister once said that when I really want something, I do it. This happened recently with my graduate school applications. I got really invested in my research, created a spreadsheet to sort information and applied (which stretches of procrastination in the mix but it was easier to combat since I already had all of the information laid out in front of me).\n\nHyperawareness? I don\u2019t think I have OCD, but I definitely feel like I have some OCD tendencies. If something icky-feeling touches me, this includes something unclean or certain textures, I am hyperaware of my skin for awhile afterward. Sometimes having to wash my hands (or wherever) multiple times but still fixating.\n(There\u2019s more I was going to add but I spent so much time writing I forgot LOL.)\n\nDespite how it probably looks, this was the condensed version of things. I have a therapy appointment tomorrow and will bring all of this up there, but I guess I just wanted some input from other ADHD womne. I  have a friend who says she would not be surprised by this diagnosis for me (and actually also feels like she might have ADHD too). But I also have my sister, who I presented this to yesterday and her response was \u201cYou don\u2019t have ADHD. Sorry if this sounds dismissive, but I feel like we live in a time of overdiagnosis.\u201d\nIn conclusion, just looking for some thoughts.", "created_utc": "1650808526.0", "edited": "1650808864.0", "id": "i6016im", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_uabhcz", "parent_id": "t3_uabhcz", "score": "3", "subreddit": "adhdwomen", "subreddit_id": "t5_31aao"}, {"author": "BlueInspiration", "body": "I guess I shouldn\u2019t be surprised about the permanently attached wheelchairs since I can only think of one book where a blind character used a cane\u2026 Before \u201cgetting her  sight back\u201d a few pages later.

I live in a very accepting area but have mixed responses from family and am also dealing with my own internal struggles so I just want to read about characters who are settled and happy and whose struggles come from normal romantic angst. With that said, I do also find it important to read those books, the ones where the characters struggle because of the external and internalized homophobia in the world. But I think it should be easier to find (or maybe there just needs to be more written) of the fluffier reads.\n\tWith that said, I thought that post was so interesting. Thinking about who the author hears complaints from most often. Straight women (or people, in general) not wanting to read about a very real aspect of queer life in their romance novels. Especially, for the shoulder check specifically, a gesture that is so small. Obviously, There\u2019s history behind it, but it adds an element of realism that I don\u2019t think has to take away from the overall lightness of the plot. This leads me to being hyperaware that many of the m/m I read is written by women. And, when I do read something written by a male author, I try to analyze, if I didn\u2019t like it, why that was. Was it the writing? Or because female-written m/m often follows different guidelines?\n\tFinally, it was fascinating to read the perspective of a bi man reading f/f. I think an m/m novel was the first place where I found myself reading an LGBTQ romance that wasn\u2019t just a subplot for the best friend character. And it was really exciting for me, as a bisexual woman to one, read about a different relationship makeup and two, read a relationship with no gender-based power imbalance. Also, I remember liking, but not being particularly blown away by Wrong Number, Right Woman. I thought that (I believe her name was Eliza?), Eliza\u2019s mental process was very realistic though. After reading a few GFY books now, I realize I\u2019m not very fond of the trope though. Unlike in Wrong Number, I feel like the authors don\u2019t spend enough time on the relationship once the characters have sorted themselves out.

But after the pandemic started, I haven\u2019t been wanting to read the gore that\u2019s seemingly ubiquitous in fantasy. This means that I threw myself more intensely into romance\u2026 Which I was already reading a lot of. I think sometimes there\u2019s a bit of a block because I want to read the romance, but I want a paranormal element but I also want the magic without the war and gore. This means that I have to do a lot more searching and looking at trigger warnings.\n  I\u2019ve also been on an M/M kick for a while now. I discovered that, once I found my preferred tropes in LGBTQ romances, I rarely wanted to go back to M/F (which had already been frustrating me for years). However, it\u2019s not equally balanced across the spectrum. I find very few F/F romances that I think are written well and that also hold my attention. But I keep going back and trying again because I feel bad or\u2026 Guilty? that I\u2019m almost solely reading m/m. But I tend to like the way that the sex scenes are written more. Sometimes I find what I\u2019m looking for in YA F/F\u2026 In terms of the tropes or the chemistry. But then, there\u2019s not enough sex! But also, I don\u2019t think I want to read very detailed sex scenes between 16--year-olds.

Learning a language keeps your brain active which is supposed to help to keep Alzheimer\u2019s at bay. You\u2019re also broadening your knowledge base, opening yourself up to more music and literature. There\u2019s all sorts of good reasons to learn a language even without a big goal. Also, you might not have a big goal going in, but that might change as you learn.\n  I am currently learning French and I do take private lessons once a week online. I found a French specific language school in my area and have been working with them for nearly a year. What I like about my school is that they have a bunch of different events: workshops for specific areas of the language, cultural events and talks with interesting people. At this point, its half online or small in person groups. But I hear they used to have parties where you could learn about different cultural aspects, had wine, cheese and other French foods/desserts, and got to be around tons of other people who spoke your language. There was an event recently where we spoke to a plus size model working in the US, talking about fat culture in France as compared to here. The instructors are also all native speakers which I think is awesome. Obviously, you don\u2019t have to be a native teacher to speak and teach well. But before seeking out a language school, I tried learning French at my university, and my professor was so frustrating! Not only was he not the best/most accommodating teacher, he also loved to put down English culture as he taught us French. Now, I\u2019m not the most patriotic person\u2026 But every time he was like \u201coh yeah, we do this in English which doesn\u2019t make sense, French makes so much more sense\u201d, I would be like, if you did a quick Google search, you would find out that not only is there a reason behind it, it was also actually probably influenced by the Norman conquest of England. (I was an English major, so I think if you were only coming for culture I might have shrugged it off more, but a lot of times it was from a linguistic perspective.)\n  Anyway, if I weren\u2019t taking these lessons, I do not think I would be so diligent with my language learning. (Diligent is relative since I definitely could be studying more.) But having weekly lessons forces me to at least make sure I keep my skills up minimally so I don\u2019t fall behind. My instructor also forces me to speak (and think) more and more in French with each lesson. Which, intern, is forcing me to review more so that I\u2019m not floundering as much. It\u2019s a great way to stay accountable.\n  My goals are pretty nebulous, I\u2019d love to visit France someday (and other French speaking countries). I at least want to have a less awkward experience should I have another layover in a Montreal airport. I\u2019m blind and so receive assistance from airport staff to help me from one gate to the other. Because of my French last name, they assumed I spoke French and just started speaking to me and my friend when we landed. Since we\u2019re both blind, we did not realize they were talking to us for a while lol it was a lot of \u201canglais! Anglais!\u201d from that point, Both from me and the people assisting us LOL (In contrast, my friend is Colombian and has a very Spanish name\u2026 So they just defaulted to English with her.)\n  In conclusion, if lessons will make you happy, go for it. And, especially because you have no big plans, whether you find a language school or use italkie or some other resource, how well you can speak or understand will be one way for you to measure progress. Or to hold yourself accountable if that\u2019s what you need.

I was 23 before the pandemic started\u2026 Now I\u2019m somehow 25. In that time, I graduated, lost a friend, got Covid, tried out a few therapists, moved in with a friend when I had to move out of the dorm for a few months (While her mom was stuck in Columbia since she decided to go back home two weeks before everything shut down), then moved in with my mom and stayed in a pretty toxic environment for about a year before moving in with my sister and her fianc\u00e9, started ice skating, kept up music lessons\u2026 And it all feels kind of distant.\n  I also find myself constantly feeling guilty for not doing things that I feel I should be doing. Not being energized enough. Also losing interest in things I used to love doing like baking. And also discovery that while I always refer to myself as an extroverted introvert (or introverted extrovert) I didn\u2019t know just how true that was until I realize that I genuinely seem to get energy from being around people.

So hopefully I can also be of some help.\n  Thus far, I\u2019ve done a combination of things. In my last semester of college, I tried taking a class but my professor was pretty terrible. I ended up finding a French specific language school and doing private lessons (rather than group). I like the private lessons because it was a lot easier for my instructor and I to adjust to each other over zoom. During her group classes, she would use the whiteboard feature which isn\u2019t accessible. In our private sessions, she uses the chat. I don\u2019t have my Braille Sense connected to my laptop, so it takes me a few extra seconds to copy over the sentences she wants me to translate, then think about it. So private lessons allow for this flexibility. That said, there\u2019s also nothing wrong with group classes so long as your fianc\u00e9e has access to the material ahead of time (So that she can keep up with/read along with classmates and instructors).\n  In addition to that, I also use YouTube. I\u2019m partial to Learn French With Alexa; her personality is delightful and her videos usually fairly quick and informative. But there are tons of other good channels out there. Also, podcasts. Coffee Break French is a good one. I\u2019ve also recently begun looking up podcasts where the host speaks primarily in French, but slowly and clearly so that I work on listening more.\n  If your fianc\u00e9e has a braille display, she can connect it to her phone or tablet while watching Netflix or Disney+ (I can\u2019t speak to the accessibility of subtitles on other streaming platforms). Then she can watch English shows with French subtitles. I like doing it that way so that I can still have the English audio description describing the action since I would have no idea what was happening with French AD. With the braille display connected, she can also access Kindle, iBooks, or other digital material in her target language. This next bit is iPhone specific (I don\u2019t know much about the android platform). Under the voiceover accessibility settings, in the braille section, you can add language tables. Currently, I have the uncontracted French braille table on the rotor. (As things stand for me right now, I don\u2019t think I have the capacity to start learning the contracted brail codes for other languages, so I stick with uncontracted but learn their accent marks.) there are also books that she can download directly onto her device (I think if it\u2019s a note taker, not a display though). The OP mentioned booksshare books, but if you are in the US and have access to NLS bard, they also have some translated books.\n  Finally, just try to interact with as much French content as possible. Music, maybe listening and imitating speakers at a more advanced level on YouTube or in Podcasts, just to get a feel for the flow and sounds of the language. And if you or your fianc\u00e9 have any other French related questions, don\u2019t hesitate to PM me \u263a\ufe0f\nYes, I apologize for any typos.

And now I\u2019m listening to how terribly I Projected as compared to my friend\u2026 Who also stayed on key \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "created_utc": "1647223718.0", "edited": "1647224174.0", "id": "i0kgjzj", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_tdj2fo", "parent_id": "t3_tdj2fo", "score": "2", "subreddit": "singing", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rlcx"}, {"author": "BlueInspiration", "body": "Some people complain about Friends for being about six white people. But, something I always think about is: were there ANY POC characters? from what I remember, there were black nurses, I think Chandler\u2019s supervisor, and a black paleontologist.\n  I start with that example to say that, were there no Black people at all, in 90s New York City, that would have felt inaccurate. People often tend to stick to their own group, yes. But setting matters too. Now, I think that was a little easier to accomplish visually whereas in writing you\u2019ll have to describe the character or give some identifying feature to acknowledge that they are representative of another race, disability, etc. And I think that\u2019s important and representative of the real world. But, depending on the setting, it can definitely come off as tokenism rather than natural inclusion. And honestly, that doesn\u2019t even have to be a bad thing but it is frustrating if the author is only working off of stereotypes. Doing research into a culture isn\u2019t always enough to feel authentic.\n  This always ends up with me feeling torn on the subject. As a blind black woman, I\u2019d like to see at least one of those identities reflected in the media. (At this point, I just really want good blind representation.) And I do think it\u2019s important to branch out, research about people and cultures you don\u2019t know. But also, sometimes, depending on the portrayal, it\u2019s better left out.\nWith more authors of color being published, it\u2019s a little bit easier for me too pull back from a predominantly white narrative and find other stories though, so that might also be impacting my comment here.\n\nSide rants: it drives me crazy when there are no people of color in the story\u2026 Except the bad guy. I don\u2019t care what color your villain is, but it\u2019s definitely noticeable if they are the only black, Chinese, Arabic, ETC person. Especially when the assumed default in your stories is white, and you only describe hair and eyes\u2026 Then the bad guy is all of a sudden 10 or brown or something that deviates from the norm and causes you to describe their skin tone.\n  I recently found out that Michele from the show Gilmore girls was black. I was shocked, as, being a blind person, this was never something I would have picked up on on my own. But I was so delighted to know that there was more than just one very obvious person of color (Rory\u2018s Korean best friend, Lane whose culture played into her storyline). But this show was set, predominantly, in a small town. So it made sense for people to be fairly homogeneous. Now, when they were in NYC, Hartford, Boston, I really hope that there were at least extras who were people of color because it\u2019s reflective of what you might casually see in those spaces.\n  Now, I recently found out that someone called out the writer for not having more people of color. And she said something to the extent of, I don\u2019t give a sh*t about writing stories with a message. Which, is definitely not true (and I could be miss remembering the quote) but she definitely had a lot of messages/poignant storylines with the characters she chose to write about. She just didn\u2019t really care about including a more diverse cast. And while that was upsetting to learn, I also kind of appreciated the honesty rather than some half assed attempt that would have ended in perpetuating more stereotypes.\n  Now, there are a whole bunch of other issues with the show: fat phobia, making fun of mental health. The writer has also used problematic language surrounding trans people. And that\u2019s a whole other conversation. But that casual inclusion of a character who just happen to be black made me so excited. That feeling is why I think diversity is so important and why I agree with your post. But also, why I don\u2019t want it to be a forced experience. People may definitely need to be pushed to think outside of their norm. But once diversity has been brought to their attention, I hope that it comes from a good, authentic place. Not a forced/disingenuous one. But also, more people of color in your stories means that, should it be adapted for TV, there\u2019s more work for actors of color. And if it\u2019s already a part of the narrative, there won\u2019t (or shouldn\u2019t) be this intense backlash when a character whose skin tone was never described but who was nevertheless assumed to be white, is now being portrayed by a non-white actor.\n  Oh, also, about fantasy worlds. Even if they are based on medieval Europe, I agree with the people who argue that it\u2019s now your world. You can populate it with other groups, especially when those groups did exist, and interact with Europeans during these times. And that sometimes it\u2019s a little crazy that you can conceive of including these crazy mystical creatures\u2026 But not a brown person. Or even expanding your world and seeing how a disabled person might fit in.\n\nThanks for reading my ramble", "created_utc": "1647183293.0", "edited": "False", "id": "i0hwoum", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_tbpjp7", "parent_id": "t3_tbpjp7", "score": "1", "subreddit": "TheLiteratureLobby", "subreddit_id": "t5_5z9cm0"}, {"author": "BlueInspiration", "body": "I do like French \ud83d\ude42 I also like Spanish though I\u2019ve taken a break from it for a bit.

But the one thing that I always remembered was that the mmc RUINED the fmc\u2019s career\u2026 and then she still took him back!\n\tSo, for the sake of this post, I went searching. When I couldn\u2019t find it on Google with the tidbits I remembered, I went sifting through my GoodReads and found it: You Can Have Manhattan by P. Dangelico. I provided this long-winded story to let you all know how much I went through because I would really not recommend this book and I wanted to make sure I found the title.\n\tI also took a trip down memory-lane to read about the other attrocities I couldn\u2019t remember, but knew happened:\n\tSo, the premise. (TW for death of a parent and childhood abuse). Also, many spoilers will follow:\n\tGuy finds out he\u2019s only got a year to live, if I remember correctly, he\u2019d been sitting on a cancer diagnosis. He tells fmc, as she\u2019s basically like a daughter to him. She\u2019d been with him and his wife for emergencies and hospital visits and such when his sons were not. Fmc is a good lawyer and he wants her to be the next CEO of his company but he knows most of the old men won\u2019t appreciate a woman moving in on their territory, especially someone who doesn\u2019t even have the family name. So he decides that she must marry his son: reformed playboy who wants nothing to do with the family business. He does own his own farm or ranch or something in Wyoming that he loves. So fmc, after some protest, heads out there to meet her new guy. She was also begged by the father to not mention the diagnosis to his son. (Can anyone say third act conflict?)\n\tMmc remembers her as an ice queen and I guess he wants to take her down a few pegs. So he pretends to live in a run down cabin with no hot water, having her sleep on an air matress or lumpy couch or something for several weeks. Though these people are filthy rich, she goes with it, not wanting to rock the boat too much. She\u2019s actually trying to get along with him and his lifestyle.\n\tHe reprimands her for how she dresses more than once, telling her she\u2019s distracting his men. I remember kind of glossing over these bits. Thinking it was wild, of course, but being kind of accustomed to this treatment in romance (which is kind of sad).\n\tAfter sometime, they of course fall in love and get married (though whether they loved one another or not, it didn\u2019t matter, it just had to be believable to the higher ups and rest of the public). Dad passes away, mmc decides that fmc is to blame. She knew about the diagnosis all along after all. And, I don\u2019t think he was wrong for being upset/grieving. But then he humiliates her multiple times in front of the company higher-ups. Calling her a gold digger and such. Also having her be served divorce papers AT THE OFFICE. And of course all of this isn\u2019t just going to stay within the company walls, so she can\u2019t even get a job somewhere else.\n\tI have no clue why he eventually has a change of heart, but he tries to find her and grovel and she tells him that, 16 years of an abusive childhood couldn\u2019t compare to the hurt he caused her in five minutes. (On the topic of her childhood, he learned about the abuse she faced, and so knew how much his family meant to her.)But somehow. SOME F*CKING HOW\u2026 they still end up back together!!!!!\n\tThe only person in this story who had any sense was fmc\u2019s secretary/friend. I do remember appreciating the wild goose chase around the world he had the mmc go on to get fmc back. It was unfortunately believable that she might start over in a new country because, while she still had all of her accolades, I\u2019m pretty sure her reputation amongst top companies was ruined. But in the end, he also signed the company over to her, a company he never really cared about\u2026 and she accepted!!!\n\u2026 Sorry for the wall of text.

I think I had opinions, and even voiced them, but I learned to stop presenting them when there was always pushback.

I feel like I think about a situation, start developing an opinion, on something  but even as I\u2019m forming it, especially if it has to do with a perceived wrong, I\u2019d always think that perhaps I was overexaggerating.\n\tBut the reason I say yes and no is because I\u2019ll be somewhat firm on my likes/dislikes\u2014even if I sometimes felt like I was punished for them\u2014but I struggle with making decisions.

Or she\u2019d get upset if I did buy one, because I said I hated them\u2026 no, I liked maxi dresses, that\u2019s just not what you bought me. So I\u2019d sometimes just ignore the desire for something I wanted. I think I\u2019d only be firm on things that definitely would not make me comfortable and just said whatever to the rest. But anyway, this also lead to me not always wanting to decide when she asked what I wanted to eat. The more elaborate, (sometimes just meaning a dish she had never heard of) the more judgment\u2026 unless it tasted really good.\n\tAlso, being blind, she would just sometimes take a decision out of my hands, deciding that this or that thing would be \u201ceasier\u201d despite my protests.

And while it was definitely not targeted for my age group, I had already read a few other books (generally in the paranormal romance arena) that featured BDSM. And so, I could never get into the hype. I couldn\u2019t quite express it then, but something was always off about the portrayals of BDSM, it was very different from what I had seen in the other books I read. On top of that, Anna represented so many of the traits that was beginning to drive me crazy about romance heroines.\n  Fast-forward eight or so years, and you find a reader very wary of billionaire romances but who also just read Boyfriend Material and wanted to devour Alexis Hall\u2019s other works. So, with much trepidation at the comparisons I kept seeing in reviews, I read Ardy\u2019s story\u2026 And loved it! I didn\u2019t take the time to analyze why (as you so thoroughly and wonderfully did) but from the beginning the\u2026 Energy of the story, and what I think, we as readers, were supposed to get out of it was very different. Similar to 50 though, I didn\u2019t enjoy the third book in either trilogy as much. But I finished Arden\u2018s tale where I couldn\u2019t bear to with 50 and I\u2019ve never looked back.\n  Thanks for taking the time to put all of this into words. It was well done and I completely agree with all of it. Also, after reading through some of the comments, I agree with your assessment that Joe Leslie\u2018s narration was amazing.

Straight women who have never been with a man imagine what it would be like: sex, relationship all the time without trying to downplay it.\nI don\u2019t find myself equally attracted to men and women, so I think that on top of the fact that I try to downplay things is why I gravitate toward the term heteroflexible. It seems less intense\u2026 Does that make any sense? It makes me feel like I\u2019m not faking it, just, you know, open. Which, in the end, just sounds like me saying everything but I\u2019m attracted to women sometimes and it\u2019s okay.
