For example, if you're given an order to tell IT to take the pronouns back out of the email signature, comply with it. But if you're ordered to take the pronouns back out, tell HR that you can't do that, and they should talk to IT. My thinking here is that this buys you a bit more time, and it makes HR look stupid in front of more people.\n* Maybe you could change your email signature to \"Ms. Jesse Smith\" or whatever - even better if you have relevant credentials or degrees, you can include those too (\"Ms. Jesse Smith, J.D.

I've only had my own bike in the DC for a bit over a year. Here's what I've gotten since then.\n\n**Lights**\n\nGet a headlight and a tail light. Strictly speaking, DC law requires you to use a white headlight and a red tail light if you want to bike after dark. But even if it weren't the law, it would still be a good idea. Nearly any light will work here. Don't overthink it. Get lights even if you don't intend to do night riding - this allows you to not have to worry as much about dusk. If you're behind your intended pace you won't need to hoof it home as quick.\n\nI also have a string of LED 'fairy lights' woven between the spokes of each of my wheels. I do this mostly for fun - I like having wheels that I can light up at night. It also improves my visibility from the side at night... but it's definitely more fun than function.\n\n**Attire**\n\nHelmet for sure! But that's already on your list.\n\nI got fingerless gloves with pads on the palms a few months into my first bike. I was getting a bit of numbness due to high vibration (I was going offroad on a hybrid bike) and poor posture (I didn't trust my balance, so I was putting more weight on my hands/arms than I should have). Padded gloves reduced the vibration and reduced the numbness. This should be pretty low on your list - I would say get them only if you start to get that numbness. (There may be other good reasons to wear gloves besides this, of course).\n\nMy first bike has a relatively padded seat with a built in suspension in the pole. My second bike has a harder seat and no suspension. When I started riding my second bike, I realized I needed padded shorts. I got some from REI that I wear under other shorts, e.g. gym shorts, or even under long pants. I don't bother with them for trips under about 10 miles, but anything that length or more I wear them.\n\nI have a basic windbreaker jacket that I wear, or at least bring, when biking. A long biking trip can start in the cool morning and end at warm midday - so it's good to be able to adjust your attire accordingly.\n\n**Repair**\n\nIf you're intending to go beyond walking distance from a Metro stop (e.g. Roosevelt Island and for sure Great Falls) you'll want a basic maintenance/repair kit. My kit includes the following, but you should tailor yours to your expected needs: \n\n* spare inner tube\n* inner tube patch kit\n* tire levers (x2)\n* portable pump\n* basic multi tool\n* granola bars for emergency energy boost\n\n**Storage**\n\nYou'll definitely want something, but getting a fancy backpack is not at all necessary. I keep my repair kit and snacks in a drawstring bag, which I either just wear on my back or put into another bag. (I also put my phone/keys there so I don't have to worry about them falling out of my pockets)\n\nMy \"other bag\" is a cheap pannier bag that I got on Amazon, which sits on my rack which I also ordered on Amazon. I went a bit too cheap on the rack so don't do what I did, but it still worked out fine. I like having the option to use the pannier because it allows me to take larger amounts of snacks/water on longer trips, and it keeps my back free of bags which feels nice. It also allows me to carry small amounts of cargo such as groceries, commuter needs, or picnic supplies etc.\n\nFor water storage, I have just a single water bottle holder. That's enough for me most of the time. If I anticipate needing more water, I throw extra into my storage bags.\n\n**Lock**\n\nA good U lock is a good move. I personally have a chain lock that I think is secure enough, but as far as I know it's never been truly tested. Keep your bike indoors or within your sight if at all possible.\n\n**Electronics/paraphernalia**\n\nI would actually recommend against a phone holder, and perhaps controversially, also against wireless earbuds/headphones. Personally if I need navigation, I keep my phone in my bag on my back or in my jacket pocket, and run a cheap pair of wired earbuds up to my right ear. I think having a screen in sight would be very distracting (and therefore dangerous) for me, personally.

Then a \u2018Sovereign Citizen\u2019 Changed the Locks.**\n\n*A New Jersey woman was preyed upon by a fast-growing extremist group that claims its members are sovereign Moors, not bound by U.S. laws.*\n\nBy Sarah Maslin Nir\n\nThe official-looking letters started arriving soon after Shanetta Little bought the cute Tudor house on Ivy Street in Newark. Bearing a golden seal, in aureate legalistic language, the documents claimed that an obscure 18th-century treaty gave the sender rights to claim her new house as his own.\r  \n\r  \nShe dismissed the letters as a hoax.\r  \n\r  \nAnd so it was with surprise that Ms. Little found herself in her yard on Ivy Street on a June afternoon as a police SWAT team negotiated with a man who had broken in, changed her locks and hung a red and green flag in its window. He claimed he was a sovereign citizen of a country that does not exist and for whom United States laws do not apply.\r  \n\r  \nMs. Little was a victim of a ploy known as paper terrorism, a favorite tactic of an extremist group that is one of the fastest growing, according to government experts and watchdog organizations. Known as the Moorish sovereign citizen movement, and loosely based around a theory that Black people are foreign citizens bound only by arcane legal systems, it encourages followers to violate existent laws in the name of empowerment. Experts say it lures marginalized people to its ranks with the false promise that they are above the law.\r  \n\r  \nThe man who entered her house, Hubert A. John of Los Angeles, was arrested on June 17 and charged with criminal mischief, burglary, criminal trespass and making terroristic threats. Prosecutors in New Jersey are preparing to take the case before a grand jury, according to Katherine Carter, a spokeswoman for the Essex County Prosecutor\u2019s office. He was released on his own recognizance.\r  \n\r  \nBut the strange letters declaring that Ms. Little\u2019s home is not her own still come. They arrive on faux-consular letterhead using the name Lenapehoking of the Al Moroccan Empire at New Jersey State Republic. Lenapehoking was the land between New York City and Philadelphia that includes New Jersey and was home to the Indigenous Lenape tribe before it was colonized by European settlers. Mr. John and his group refer to themselves as Moors.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cThe Moors claim to be about Black liberation and opportunity, and uplifting Black people,\u201d Ms. Little said in an interview seated on a staircase inside her house. \u201cBut he is literally oppressing me and taking what\u2019s mine as a Black woman.\u201d\r  \n\r  \n\r\rThis past summer the Moorish movement exploded into public view, after Ms. Little posted viral TikTok accounts of her ordeal and when the police pulled over members of a militant offshoot of the group on a Massachusetts highway. That subgroup, known as Rise of the Moors, engaged in a standoff with the police for more than nine hours, claiming that as sovereign citizens, law enforcement had no authority to stop them. No one was injured; 11 people were arrested and charged with unlawful possession of firearms and ammunition, among other offenses.\r  \n\r  \nIncreasingly, across the country sovereign citizens have clashed with the authorities, tied up resources and frazzled lives in their insistence that laws, such as the requirement to pay taxes, obey speed limits and even obtain, say, a license for a pet dog, do not apply to them.\r  \n\r  \nPeople who claim to be Moorish sovereign citizens believe they are bound mainly by maritime law, not the law of the places where they live, said Mellie Ligon, a lawyer and author of a study of their impact on the judicial system in the Emory International Law Review.\r  \n\r  \nInitially espoused by white supremacist groups, sovereign citizen ideology first cropped up in America in the 1970s, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center. The Moorish permutation appears to have picked up in popularity in the 1990s, inspired in part by Black identity ideology of a similarly named religious group, the Moorish Science Temple of America, which disavows the sovereign citizen movement.\r  \n\r  \nMembership in the Moorish sovereign citizen movement has been driven by the internet into the hundreds of thousands, the law center said. On its website, Rise of the Moors, for example, has cited reparations \u2014 part of national conversations about race and equity \u2014 as a driving factor for its belief that its members can claim things as their own.\r  \n\r  \nRise of the Moors, as well as the individual members arrested in Massachusetts in July, did not respond to requests to comment.\r  \n\r  \nWhy Mr. John set his sights on Ms. Little\u2019s house is unknown. They don\u2019t know each other, according to Ms. Little, who says they have never met before she found him in her home.\r  \n\r  \nLike many Moorish followers, Mr. John adopted an Arabic-influenced name, Jaleel Hu-El. He did not respond to multiple requests for comment. Via an email, a staff member at the Al Moroccan consulate, where Mr. John is listed on the website as the consul general to the United States and China, initially scheduled an interview but then canceled.\r  \n\r\r  \nThe events of June 17 are a sharp departure from Mr. John\u2019s public persona: Dressed in sharp suits and often wearing a red fez, Mr. John is a self-styled fashion mogul. In a podcast interview, he said he spent nine years in banking before buying a one-way ticket to China in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis.\r  \n\r  \n\r\rThere, Mr. John said, he was scouted by a modeling agent, kicking off a foray into the fashion world. He became fluent in Chinese and produced several fashion shows focusing on Black designers and models, according to multiple accounts. \u201cThey never had the opportunity for us to showcase our talent, so I created the opportunity,\u201d Mr. John said on the podcast.\r  \n\r  \nHow he changed from dapper entrepreneur to a Moorish national confronted by a New Jersey SWAT team is opaque. Around 2018, the social media accounts associated with Black X, his business association, changed tone, with posts about how to obtain Moorish license plates and identity cards, and explainers of abstruse legal tactics.\r  \n\r  \nIn documents Mr. John posted online, he refers to Ms. Little\u2019s house, which was built in the 1950s, as his \u201cancestral estate,\u201d but according to the Essex County prosecutor\u2019s office there does not appear to be a connection.\r  \n\r  \nOn June 16, Ms. Little came to inspect her dream home. She had closed on it in February and was planning renovations before moving in.\r  \n\r  \nBuying the home felt like a triumph for Ms. Little, who grew up mostly in Florida as a foster child, finding security as a teenager only when her high school principal took her in.\r  \n\r  \nShe graduated from the University of Central Florida but struggled as a young adult, living out of motel rooms for periods of time. Now a senior customer service specialist with Jaguar Land Rover North America, she could afford to buy a house.\r  \n\r  \nShe tried to unlock the door but was puzzled: the locks had been replaced. The next day, she returned with a locksmith and was confronted by two men, one of whom was Mr. John and who said the house was his. After a heated exchange she called the police.\r  \n\r  \nWhen the police arrived, both Ms. Little and Mr. John showed documents claiming the house was theirs, according to a report of the incident issued by Brian A. O\u2019Hara, the Newark public safety director. She shared the property deed proving ownership, Ms. Little said, he the fabricated papers bearing the Al Moroccan seal.\r  \n\r  \nThe men \u201cclaimed to be sovereign citizens of the Al Moroccan Empire and that their status permitted them access to the property,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Hara\u2019s report said. The officers verified that Ms. Little bought the house in February, and they asked the men to leave. They did.\r  \n\r  \nThirty minutes later, Mr. John returned, brushed past Ms. Little on the porch, she said, opened the door with his own key and locked it behind him.", "created_utc": "1632702892.0", "edited": "False", "id": "heeyqx1", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_pw4sok", "parent_id": "t3_pw4sok", "score": "243", "subreddit": "amibeingdetained", "subreddit_id": "t5_2yqn8"}, {"author": "jednorog", "body": "Yeah my comment could have been a lot shorter, you're right: simply \"JJ touch grass pls\"", "created_utc": "1632449324.0", "edited": "False", "id": "he1i9j8", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_pu9adx", "parent_id": "t1_he1e92d", "score": "27", "subreddit": "questionablecontent", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjz3"}, {"author": "jednorog", "body": "I think it would benefit JJ to get off of the computer and out of the house every now and then.
