Since you mentioned Jack London, here is the first passage of Call of the Wild:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Buck did not read the newspapers, or he would have known that  \n>  \n>trouble was brewing, not alone for himself, but for every tide-  \n>  \n>water dog, strong of muscle and with warm, long hair, from  \n>  \n>Puget Sound to San Diego. Because men, groping in the Arctic darkness,  \n>  \n>had found a yellow metal, and because steamship and transportation  \n>  \n>companies were booming the find, thousands of men were rushing into  \n>  \n>the Northland. These men wanted dogs, and the dogs they wanted were  \n>  \n>heavy dogs, with strong muscles by which to toil, and furry coats to  \n>  \n>protect them from the frost.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. No one these days would say \"not alone for himself\" they would say \"not only for himself\"\n2. I have no idea what \"tide-water\" actually means (when used as an adjective not a noun). As a native speaker I would just skip over that and not worry about it.\n3. I know where the Puget Sound and San Diego are because I'm from Seattle, otherwise those references might be difficult.\n4. \"strong of muscle\" is an old-fashioned way to write.\n5. \"groping in the Arctic darkness\" is poetic-sounding but not weird in a book. Not difficult for a native speaker to understand.\n6. \"Booming the find\" made me pause for a second because I've never heard that phrase before. The fact it's in a sentence that's writing about the discovery of gold in the American West in a way intended to downplay the emotional implications of it (\"yellow metal\") made it even harder to understand. Presumably it means there were a bunch of boats rushing there, which is why individual men are able to join too.\n7. \"with strong muscles by which to toil, and furry coats to protect them from the frost.\" Poetic sounding and not difficult for a native speaker to understand.\n\nSo the problem with the older books is that there is going to be a lot of words and phrases that sound good in writing but not in speech mixed in with phrases that a native speaker would recognize as just old-fashioned and would just skip over. And on top of having to figure out what everything means, as a learner you have no way to distinguish which is which. Of course I did pick the first paragraph so there's naturally some \"[first-page syndrome](https://www.tofugu.com/japanese/language-first-page-syndrom),\" but the style would still be an issue throughout. I had that problem when I tried to read the diary of Anne Frank in Dutch- I would try to use words from there and people would tell me no one talks like that anymore.\n\nSince you specifically mention wanting to be able to write literature, then I would say reading a variety of styles of books should continue to be a priority even if it's already your best skill.\n\nKeep in mind that I would also classify myself as B2, so my advice on how to reach the next level is bound to be somewhat incomplete. My listening in my target language is okay though as I can make out the words for most talk shows, documentaries, tv shows, and podcasts unless I just don't know the word or phrase, so personally I mostly just leave the subtitles on and focus on learning less common vocab through reading. How I got to that point was a mix of listening to things without subtitles that I would understand if I could read it and fleshing out my vocab to the point I knew most common spoken words, so those would be my suggestion (though you have already done the latter so you just need to do the former). The listening I still find hard is situations where jokes are involved that appear out of the blue, like stand-up comedy or get togethers with friends.", "created_utc": "1665862768.0", "edited": "1665862995.0", "id": "isgbp69", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_y4s0ox", "parent_id": "t1_isg2owp", "score": "3", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "BloemkolenNederlands", "body": "T's and D's get dropped a lot in English when the sounds glide together.  \n\n\nhttps://youtu.be/cztw76aM-18", "created_utc": "1665857688.0", "edited": "False", "id": "isfzpbi", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_y4r9ax", "parent_id": "t3_y4r9ax", "score": "1", "subreddit": "EnglishLearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2u8ap"}, {"author": "BloemkolenNederlands", "body": "You might be there already with reading and writing.

The CEFR level says B2 is able to read contemporary novels with a dictionary and C1 can without a dictionary if they wanted to, which it sounds like you can, and in fact you're reading older books which is fairly high level.\n\nYour vocabulary is actually quite good, but frequently people use advanced words because they are related to common words in their native language, or because they don't have a grasp of what words are normal to use, so it's a little hard for me to judge. Relish, hazy, and thereabouts specifically standout as words that are rare and make your writing sound very good but I don't know the reasons you used them (all were used correctly, though hazy is normally used with a qualifier for some reason). Other good vocabulary was used in a way that didn't standout (for example aim instead of goal, deduce instead of figure out).\n\nYou used a lot of good connecting words in a way that was natural.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe grammar mistakes you made were basically unnoticeable until I tried to look for them:\n\n\"in the light of the online tests I've done\" isn't actually how a native speaker would use \"in light of\" but it didn't stand out as wrong (normally it's used to indicate a change in action you're about to take as a result of new information, not as a way to preface an estimate).\n\nI might have said nevertheless instead of nonetheless.

For example, the descriptor for C1 vocabulary is \"Has a good command of a broad lexical repertoire allowing gaps to be readily overcome with circumlocutions; little obvious  \nsearching for expressions or avoidance strategies,\" which is nonsensical to describe native speakers because they never in the first place had to avoid using certain grammatical constructions to get around their gaps in speaking ability.

I think the most recent revelation I had is that there is still sooo much to improve after B2.

But there are still a lot of straight up errors that need to be fixed and vocabulary to learn.\n\nI think because so many people at B1 say they are B2 when they aren\u2019t, there\u2019s a tendency to gatekeep (for a good reason) the B2 level by talking up how fluent you are at that stage.

B2 also says you can produce clear detailed descriptions whereas C1 says you can produce clear, detailed, *well structured* descriptions. Part of being C1 is being B2 but without making so many structural errors.
