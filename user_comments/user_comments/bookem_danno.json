If I misunderstood, please correct me.\n\nThere were two main points to my response: Firstly, Zoroastrian communities were not very strong in the Arabian Peninsula to begin with. Zoroastrianism was among the *least* influential religions in the peninsula at the time, outpaced by Christianity, native polytheism, and (probably) Judaism. So, why would the Arabs have any interest in a religion which offers some kind of bridge to a foreign faith that they don't really care all that much about in the first place? If that really would be the primary draw of embracing Manichaeism, it would be offering a service to them that they don't actually want, nor need. So why would that be their reason for converting?\n\nBut the second relevant point is that Manichaeism *never was* a bridge between Christianity and Zoroastrianism. Mani was a product of his environment: He was exposed to Christian, Zoroastrian, and Buddhist thought -- comingled with the gnostic cults already existing in the region during his time -- and drew his own conclusions under their influence. A religion which is influenced directly and indirectly by several other religions is very different from a religion which actively tries to appeal to and reconcile the followers of two distinct religions. So, even if the Arabs were somehow interested in a religion which could appeal to Zoroastrians and Christians, that's not what Manichaeism is in the first place -- nor did it ever aspire to be -- so it's out of place here.\n\nWhat I was trying to argue in my original post was that you can't expect two bodies of divergent religious traditions to simply put aside their differences and agree to a third religion, which exists as a compromise between the first two. Manichaeism may well be a successful religion on its own, but it doesn't derive its success from being a religion of compromises -- which was the point you seemed to be making in your first post.", "created_utc": "1665455893.0", "edited": "1665456812.0", "id": "irudbo8", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_y0l1by", "parent_id": "t1_iru73eb", "score": "2", "subreddit": "AlternateHistory", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rux3"}, {"author": "bookem_danno", "body": "How do you define the success of Manichaeism? It survived in pockets and had small numbers of followers throughout the Middle East and Central Asia, but you're right, it was never politically relevant. It also did not seek, nor did it actually achieve, some kind of \"happy medium\" between Christianity and Zoroastrianism as you describe. It was just one of many gnostic cults which arose in the region after the time of Christ and before Mohammad. While gnosticism was often very syncretic, the tradition has origins all its own and didn't arise as somebody's slapdash attempt at reconciling two opposing religions. So when you say \"Manichaeism did that and it worked\", what exactly do you mean? What's your measure for success?\n\nAlso, what Hindu reform are you talking about? To this day, Hinduism is not really one unified religion, but more of an umbrella term for a continuum of interrelated religious traditions spanning all of India. What historical reformation are you talking about? The only thing even remotely similar that I can think of is Neo-Vedanta, which doesn't show up until the late 19th century and is not, by any means, the prevailing interpretation of Hindu tradition (outside the west, anyway).\n\nFinally, I didn't say that Judaism and Arabian polytheism were going to survive, what I did say was that they had a stronger following in the region than Zoroastrianism to begin with. So even if Manichaeism was some kind of compromise between Christians and Zoroastrians (which, again, it wasn't), why would any Arab be interested in that to begin with?

Is there a way to tell? Is there a way to shift from the former to the latter? Does any of it matter? Are these musings even legitimate or are they just coming from a place of scrupulosity that will muck up the experience that you\u2019ve been waiting so long for even more so than all these worldly influences?\n\nFor ethical reasons I'm going to throw in the warning on scrupulosity that I always throw in on posts like this: Go to your priest, first and foremost; a trusted spiritual advisor who knows you and your individual needs and struggles. Most of the advice you get on the internet is not helpful. \n\nFirst of all, I want to say that I think you're already on the right path by not doing what so many do, and saying that all sexual desire is unholy. It isn't! It's a good thing to desire your wife! \n\nThe best bit of information I ever read about the difference between love and lust was something I saw on this very sub. I wish I could attribute it better than that, but the best I can manage is to paraphrase:\n\nEssentially, you are lusting for somebody when you don't see anything in them besides their sexual characteristics: It doesn't matter who this woman is, just that she *is* a woman, and you are a man. In essence, if you see a woman as nothing more than a walking vagina, you're doing it wrong. The kind of love you're talking about, the kind you see in Song of Songs (great example, by the way!) comes from love for a *person*, as an individual, and a desire to be near them in an intimate way. So, sex organ with legs, or human person? The difference is pretty easy to see, so no need to overthink it!\n\nLet me be clear that this doesn't mean your attraction to somebody is solely cerebral -- of course her body is going to be desirable to you, but you can't separate the body from the person. Do you see the difference? A body isn't an object, it's a critical part of who somebody is!\n\nPart 2... let me challenge your assumptions about early marriage. There is no time in history where it ever worked this way for men. Yes, *women* were often married off (not by their choice, btw) at very young ages, but it was generally to older men -- sometimes much older! Even in latter eras when arranged marriages began to become less common, it *was* common for an eligible lady to be courted by an older, more established man. Commonly, men didn't get married until as late as their thirties or forties! Don't believe me? Take a walk through your town's oldest graveyard sometime and look for age differences between couples before about 1900. \n\nEither way, the bottom line is that you are where you are. You're not going to get married at 16. What's left to you is to live the life that God *has* given to you. That's always a process of *becoming*, as God unfolds the story of your salvation before you. You are growing into something, even if that means that right now things aren't the way we hope they would be. But with His help, we all rise to the challenge every day. Why wish for things that we don't have the power to change to be different? Act where you know you can, but don't worry yourself over the things you know you can't.\n\n\"Is your cucumber bitter? Throw it away. Are there briars in your path? Turn aside. That is enough. Do not go on and say, 'Why were things of this sort ever brought into this world?' neither intolerable nor everlasting - if thou bearest in mind that it has its limits, and if thou addest nothing to it in imagination.\"\n\nThe good news is that at the end of it all, you don't rely on your own strength to \"throw the cucumber away\" or \"avoid the briars.\" It's not about what we do, it's about what we allow God to do through us! \n\nOne final point is that I believe that these kinds of feelings are actually a symptom of *porneia*, not something that is created *by porneia*. I know too many good guys who are way too messed up with addiction to pornography to have a reasonable view on women and how to interact with them. It rewires your brain to see them as sources of fulfillment for *you*. If you view a woman as just a means to your own ends -- even if that end is *marriage* -- you're still treating her as an object and not a person. A bit like our definition of lust! I advise any man who is a consumer of pornography to do their best to quit and to never stop trying, even when they fall.

We've been through some high highs and low lows, and we've grown in ways we never expected. There were times we almost didn't make it, and times where things absolutely didn't have to work out for us. And yet somehow, even against all odds, they always did. I thank God for that -- and for her -- every day. I have no doubt in my mind that the endurance of our relationship is a God thing. There's just no way we could have done it all on our own.\n\nAll of that being said, framing somebody as \"the person God intended for you\" is missing the mark. It's not that I don't believe she is, of course I do. But the ironic thing about putting that stamp of \"the one God picked for me\" on somebody is that it really takes the attention off of God, and puts it right back on the two of you.\n\nGod is not going to give you a flashing neon sign that says \"THIS IS THE ONE!\" The heavens will not open and the choir of angels will not begin to sing their name when you meet their gaze. It's never going to be completely obvious to you. You can't go into this believing you're going to get a sign, or that it's going to feel a certain way when you finally meet that person. If you spend too much time looking for signs, you won't notice the things that are really important. It might be the best thing that's ever happened to you, but I swear it'll pass right under your nose if you waste too much time analyzing it for some kind of proof. \n\nI love my fianc\u00e9e with all of my heart. She is the best and closest friend I've ever had. I can be myself with her more than any other person on the planet, and I know she would say the same about me. There was no great revelation, no dramatic unveiling, but that was how it happened: And then it kept happening, again and again, even when things were hard. It's not all cerebral, of course: I go weak when she gets all done up and wears a dress and heels, or when she strokes my forearm while I'm driving, or when her goofy side comes out and she giggles and scrunches up her nose. Judging by the way she looks at me when I put on a suit, or when I have a good belly-laugh, or when I sit up telling her stories before she goes to sleep, I'd say the feeling is mutual. But above everything else, she's the person I know would stick by me, even (and especially) if nobody else did. It's a gift, and, shy of eternal salvation, the greatest one I could have asked for. \n\nThe way things go when you meet your one person is going to be completely different from the way it went for everybody else.

I'll elaborate on that later. \n\nI received a small but significant percentage of SSA in my results when I did 23andMe. My mom's side of the family is colonial stock from Virginia, so it would have made sense for it to have come from there -- but an uncle on that side of the family tested and had no SSA. The only option that left was my dad's side, which is Italian with no known ties to Africa. I was confused, and *everybody* I asked about it on this sub would dismiss it as noise -- even though it stuck around at high confidence levels and generally hovered at or above 1%.\n\nIt didn't make sense. So I jumped down a rabbit hole trying to figure out who this mysterious African ancestor would have been, and I've learned a lot in the process. There can be slight variances in inheritance even between siblings which likely would have led to my mom receiving that small amount of SSA input, but not her brother. I'm now completely sure that this ancestor was African American, whether free or slave. There's nothing in our family history documenting it, but that shouldn't be surprising given the time frame and location. \n\nThe bottom line is these myths about how to quantify something as \"noise\" as well as how genetic inheritance works perpetuate ignorance on these questions. *Anything* that flies in the face of what somebody thinks they know about themselves is going to be met with resistance unless there's a good way to educate them about these things. 23andMe could do a better job with it, but so could we on this very subreddit.\n\nEDIT: I'll add the caveat that none of this is to dismiss the very real possibility that some people are just racist.

All you have to do is lurk this subreddit for a day or two to see that what he's saying is true. People are generally more socially awkward than they used to be in face-to-face situations because social media has weakened the person-to-person aspect of socializing in a lot of ways. However, religious circles seem to have been hit especially hard by this, and young men in particular. Sorry to any guys who think that that's a call-out, but it's true. Women aren't exempt, but men have it a lot worse. Either way, it seems like, increasingly among religious young people, the grip on social norms is becoming tenuous.\n\nI'm Orthodox, my fianc\u00e9e is Catholic, but we've seen it in both \"lungs\" of the Church. People are spending way too much time in their own heads and only venting into an echo chamber. So their ideas go unchallenged and pretty soon thoughts and suggestions about how meeting people ought to go become laws. Personal preferences begin to be conflated with actual Church teachings. The shadow of \"the ideal future spouse\" grows so long that nobody can possibly get out from under it. This is the baggage that people are bringing with them and it makes a real mess.\n\nI'll give you an example: I have a friend who, whenever we invite him out to socialize in a group with my fianc\u00e9e and I, basically never gives her the time of day. She thought for a while that he just really didn't like her for some reason. However, as we watched him in these situations, a pattern began to emerge: It wasn't just my fianc\u00e9e, homeboy wouldn't talk to *any* woman... *who wasn't single*. With single woman, he would awkwardly flirt without really getting anywhere, but the women who were already in relationships were basically invisible. Unless she was a candidate to be his future wife, she was of no interest, not even as a friend. We all know a guy like this. If we look hard at ourselves, we might even realize that in some ways we *are* that guy, or maybe we were that guy at some point.\n\nPeople want to treat dating like gaming a system, something that they can win if they just make sure they're in the right place at the right time with the right person. I think men and women are equally guilty of this particular bad habit: Guys think to themselves \"if I work harder at the gym, maximize my earning potential, do everything I can to make myself eminently attractive [at the surface level anyway], I can't possibly be rejected!\" I can't speak as much for ladies, because I haven't been one, but my suspicion is that the obsession over \"red flags\" might also be tied in here: While men think that their every problem in the dating world can be avoided by just working harder, women seem to think that trying to perceive and avoid awkward situations before they happen can achieve the same. Both aren't necessarily wrong: Both sexes should work on themselves and both sexes should try not to make each other uncomfortable. There are also real dangers to women in the dating world which we can't ignore or downplay. But if you make it any more complicated than that, you've already messed it up. The real experience is in getting to know somebody as a person -- not as an idealized perception.\n\nI blame a variety of things: Social media, for starters, as I already mentioned, but also the insidious influence of pornography and the strange, paradoxical overlap between modern religious communities, political conservatism, and the redpill philosophy. Paradoxical and weird because redpill tactics are very obviously contradictory to actual Church teachings, and then just plain awkward because most of the men we're talking about aren't very good at it. Either way, the end result is always the same: Treat your potential partner as an object to be acquired to achieve some kind of status in life, not as a person to get to know. For that reason, I'll also blame a pattern of well-meaning, but poorly-explained advice about the ultimate goals of dating. Yes, the ultimate goal of dating is to find your future spouse -- somebody with whom you will work every day towards sainthood. No, that doesn't mean you have to treat that person as your spouse right off the bat.\n\nThat's the part that everybody loses out on. Dating is for getting to know people, and also for getting to know yourself. Not every person you date is going to be your future spouse, and I would argue that, at least in the beginning, you shouldn't approach that way. It's impossible not to idealize a person in the early stages, but it isn't impossible to keep those expectations in check and meet a person on *their* terms, expecting them to meet you on yours. Everybody wants to rush to the finish line, everybody wants certainty. But we also think of meeting somebody who wasn't that future spouse as some kind of lost opportunity -- a waste of time. But if God allows people to come and go from our lives for a reason, how could that possibly be true? The bottom line is, everybody you will meet has some kind of value. Don't lose out on the rewards of being in the process itself because you're shooting too hard for the ideal end goal.\n\nIf whoever is reading this gathers nothing else from this post, I hope you at least get this... *go the fuck outside.* Go live in the world without being of the world. Be chaste! Hold fast to the faith and traditions which were given to you! But you can't do any of that while living entirely in your own head, chasing an ideal instead of meeting a person.\n\nThank you for coming to my TED Talk.", "created_utc": "1661607238.0", "edited": "False", "id": "im00yos", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_wyosvp", "parent_id": "t3_wyosvp", "score": "8", "subreddit": "CatholicDating", "subreddit_id": "t5_3348n"}, {"author": "bookem_danno", "body": "Haha yeah when I lived there as a single person a few years ago I do seem to remember banking being a bit more convoluted than back home.

I don't think anybody but the Byzantines can claim to be a direct successor in a political sense to Rome. But the amazing thing about Roman civilization is that nearly every culture on this planet can claim to be an heir to its legacy in small ways and big ways. Only Byzantium can claim to be the *exact same entity* as the Roman Empire.

His uncle tries to have Krishna and all of his siblings murdered because a prophesy said one of his sister\u2019s children would kill him one day. Sounds more like Oedipus and his father to me than Jesus and Herod. Krishna even ends up fulfilling the prophecy by overthrowing his uncle and killing him, just like Oedipus and his father.

I had different fears with my girlfriend in the early months of our relationship, but my thoughts fell into much the same pattern. It took a few months of counseling to realize why I was doing these things and how it was more harmful to myself than anything else. \n\nEven now as you're writing this it looks like you're struggling to decide whether or not what you did was the right thing. Ultimately, that's up to you: We're just internet randos, we don't know you, nor your ex. And if it came down to it and you decided that this was just something you couldn't be comfortable with, that's your choice only. People have all kinds of different standards for their relationships and that's up to them and their partner alone. At the end of the day, you have to be secure with your choice. \n\nI'll just say that the best advice I was ever given for my own insecurities is that the wonderful person my girlfriend is, is on display for the world to see: All of her talents, her beauty, her sympathetic and kindhearted personality. I can't stop other people from noticing that, and I would never want her to hide it. At the end of the day, I trust that I'm the one she wants to share those things with the most.\n\nTo me, it sounds like your ex had the personality of a guy trying to be a friend to a lot of people all at once. To some people that's a good thing, but I can see why others wouldn't be so happy with it. Either way, if you can conclude that this posed a genuine threat to your security in the relationship, then you made the right decision.", "created_utc": "1655313684.0", "edited": "1655345595.0", "id": "ich859y", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_vcibu9", "parent_id": "t1_ich3l4j", "score": "5", "subreddit": "CatholicDating", "subreddit_id": "t5_3348n"}, {"author": "bookem_danno", "body": "I think I'm just trying to understand if he ever failed to do these things for you when he would do it for this friend of his, or any other friends?

I\u2019m Orthodox myself but I have many Catholic loved ones so, to all Catholics, know that any mistakes I may make with your theology here are made in good faith.\n\nOne big difference includes the way the Church is governed. The Catholic Church recognizes the Pope as having universal jurisdiction over all churches. In other words, everybody with authority in the Church ultimately answers to him alone. He can also make proclamations infallibly when speaking \u201cex cathedra\u201d \u2014 \u201cfrom the chair\u201d in Latin, in other words, speaking with the full authority of the Church. A common misconception is that he does this unilaterally, but he actually needs some level of consent from the other leaders of the Catholic Church. He can\u2019t just say what he wants and have it instantly become law. Major theological decisions are generally made by the Pope in consultation with his subordinate bishops.\n\nThe Orthodox Churches on the other hand essentially function as independent, self-governing (autocephalous) entities which are united by mutual confession of faith. There is no universal head, however the Orthodox Churches do actually afford the Patriarch of Rome (the Pope) a certain primacy of honor based on historical precedent. He would have the authority to adjudicate disputes between different Churches and generally preside over Church affairs, but not \u201crule\u201d them if that makes sense. The Latin term is \u201cprimus inter pares\u201d \u2014 \u201cfirst among equals.\u201d In the absence of the Patriarch of Rome since the Great Schism in 1054, the Patriarch of Constantinople serves this role. Theological decisions and clarifications which require a Churchwide ruling are generally accomplished by a council of leading bishops and patriarchs, such as the seven ecumenical councils of late antiquity and early medieval times.\n\nYou may have heard that Christians believe in the Trinity \u2014 the shared divine nature of God the Father, Jesus Christ, and the Holy Spirit: One God, three persons. The central statement of faith accepted by Catholics, Orthodox, and most Protestants is the Nicene Creed, written in 325 AD. The Creed codifies the theology of the Trinity and makes clear the specific roles of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, while also emphasizing the unity of their divine nature. In speaking of the Holy Spirit, the Creed originally said the following:\n\n\u201cI believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord the Giver of Life, who proceeds from the Father.\u201d\n\nThis is to reflect Jesus\u2019 words in the Gospel of John:\n\n\u201cBut when the Helper comes, whom I shall send to you from the Father, the Spirit of truth who **proceeds from the Father**, He will testify of Me.\u201d (Emphasis mine)\n\nStarting in the early Middle Ages, western Christians in Spain and France added the Latin word \u201cfilioque\u201d meaning \u201cand the son\u201d to this part of the creed so that it now reads:\n\n\u201cI believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord the Giver of Life, who proceeds from the Father and the Son.\u201d\n\nSeveral popes actually resisted this change, but it became codified as official practice in the Western Church by the 11th century, adding to the tension which led to the Great Schism.\n\nWe Orthodox believe that the Trinity is a mystery and can only be understood relationally. We know from scripture that Jesus, the Son, is eternally begotten of the Father. We also know from Jesus\u2019 own words that the Spirit is sent by Him, but proceeds from the Father. We do not accept the addition of the filioque because we believe it lessens the distinctiveness of the three persons of the Trinity, which we can only begin to understand through their relationship to one another. Catholics on the other hand believe that it emphasizes the unity of the Father and the Son, which is emphasized at various points elsewhere in scripture. \n\nFinally, the two Churches differ somewhat in their practice: The Mass is the primary Catholic liturgy (at least in the Latin Church) while Orthodox Christians and Eastern Catholic Christians use the Divine Liturgy. We keep the same holidays but may celebrate them on different dates. Catholics celebrate Christmas on December 25 but \u201cOld Calendar\u201d Orthodox Christians celebrate on January 6. The date of Easter is also calculated differently, with Orthodox Easter (Pascha) usually falling a week or more later than Catholic Easter. Protestants use the same method of calculation as the Catholics. Catholic churches are also aesthetically different from Orthodox churches in many regards, including differences in architecture, art, and music owing to the Latin heritage of the Catholics and the Byzantine Greek heritage of the Orthodox. Traditionally, Catholics used statues as devotional objects while the Orthodox use icons, but icons have become increasingly popular among Catholics in recent decades.\n\nWhew\u2026 that might be more than you bargained for!

That being said, both haplogroups are only passed along on the paternal or maternal line, respectively. So when Indo-European men migrate onto new territory, they spread their father\u2019s Y-DNA haplogroup, but not their mother\u2019s mtDNA haplogroup. If a group of IE males take for wives women who do not share their mtDNA haplogroup, that lineage does not pass on. \n\nNow, the second important thing to remember is that mtDNA tends to be more diverse and more widespread \u2014 but also more thinly spread. Two common mtDNA haplogroups common among the Yamnaya (who, for the purpose of discussion, we will infer to be analogous to IE steppe migrants) were U and T. However, these haplogroups are extremely ancient and are found at varying levels throughout much of Western Eurasia.\n\nAgain, my understanding is that the reason for this lies in male competition for mates. Men tend to compete more for women than the other way around in patrilineal, patrilocal societies, so there\u2019s more at stake for the lineage of a man who does not breed.

He struck up a conversation and eventually asked us where we were from.\n\nWe had made a pact early on that we would just tell people we were Canadian, to avoid complications. Plus we\u2019re from Michigan so most people wouldn\u2019t be able to pick out our accent anyway. Nevertheless, for some reason mom decided to go ahead and tell him we were American\u2026\n\n\u201cAh. Sorry about Trump. I feel bad for you guys.\u201d\n\n(Said the man literally from fucking *Kuwait.*)\n\nEdit: Now from the opposite perspective: I went to Serbia for a little while with a friend who was an international relations major with a particular focus on the Balkans. I was on my guard a lot because I figured we were just bombing Serbia well within living memory and people probably wouldn't like Americans. I was pretty surprised to find that that wasn't true! Generally most people were welcoming, even the ones who couldn't speak English (thankfully my friend spoke enough Serbian to get us by). \n\nWe spent a significant amount of time talking to an English-speaking waiter who lived in the city during the wars and he told us that basically they understood that we were only children at the time and that they didn't really blame any of us for what happened, certainly not those of us who would have had nothing to do with it. The country's modern geopolitical stance is really disappointing, but nevertheless 8/10, would go back to Serbia.", "created_utc": "1654582750.0", "edited": "1654583959.0", "id": "ibgjxsa", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_v6boxz", "parent_id": "t3_v6boxz", "score": "9", "subreddit": "AmericaBad", "subreddit_id": "t5_10gh3w"}, {"author": "bookem_danno", "body": "I am roughly as Italian as you are (paternal grandmother is 100% Sicilian) and have the same amount of Southwest Asian DNA.

Anything you read from somebody on the internet is just a perspective, not the truth. That includes everything I'm saying now and everything I will say in the rest of this post.\n\nThe part of your post that I latched onto was where you mentioned having anxiety and being picky with dating. It's easy for anxious people -- speaking as a man who also suffers from it and who found counseling helpful -- to question themselves needlessly: Is what I'm thinking okay? Is what I'm doing okay? Is how I'm feeling okay? Is what I want okay? Oftentimes this leads us to feeling like the grass is always greener somewhere else.\n\nIt might be that you are experiencing a genuine calling towards monasticism. I'm not you, and I'm not God -- I'm just a stranger on the internet. I don't know what's best for you. But from what you're writing, it seems like there is something very good going on with your relationship as well.\n\nThe fact of the matter is that Christ can and will save you in whatever vocation you may end up. You can attain salvation just as easily as a married woman or as a nun. For that reason -- and, y'know, because you have free will -- God is not going to reach into your life and tell you \"catholickayaker, this is what I made you for!\" He *did* make you so that you could share in His kingdom with Him, and so long as you keep His commandments, you will. There's no rule that says you can only follow those commandments in a particular vocation. No matter where you end up, it will be good for you and God will use it to edify your soul. He would not give you a snake when you ask for a fish, nor a scorpion when you ask for an egg.\n\nAt the end of all this, I only have two pieces of advice: The first is what I already said: That you should open up a conversation about this with that trusted spiritual advisor. The second is to remember that in a given day, you have all kinds of thoughts. Some are ridiculous and you put them away instantly. Some are helpful and you let them teach you something. Just treat these thoughts as any other thought. Not something to feel guilty for or to push too hard against, just a thought that you had which in time is going to reveal itself to either be helpful or not.\n\nGod bless.", "created_utc": "1654578075.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ibgdn37", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_v6m3s8", "parent_id": "t3_v6m3s8", "score": "6", "subreddit": "CatholicDating", "subreddit_id": "t5_3348n"}, {"author": "bookem_danno", "body": ">That feeling when you\u2019re not necessarily sad, but you just feel really empty.\n\nYou\u2019ve unlocked a brand new extra special feeling called clinical depression.", "created_utc": "1654571760.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ibg3d7u", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_v699xq", "parent_id": "t3_v699xq", "score": "5", "subreddit": "shittyMBTI", "subreddit_id": "t5_3g35f"}, {"author": "bookem_danno", "body": "The second one sounds kinda sociopathic.", "created_utc": "1654571579.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ibg312g", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_v699xq", "parent_id": "t3_v699xq", "score": "2", "subreddit": "shittyMBTI", "subreddit_id": "t5_3g35f"}, {"author": "bookem_danno", "body": "As a brother of three sisters myself, if any of them said something like that about my girlfriend, I'd be beyond pissed.

But this is the snag which all alternate histories run across: You can never be certain that the conditions you are setting up would actually affect the change you expect. You might as well be arguing that the Roman Empire would still be around today if they had only taken steps X, Y, and Z to ensure their own survival. Maybe it would, but you can\u2019t possibly know any of the long term consequences that those steps might have. You can\u2019t control what you can\u2019t predict, and the only reality we live in is the one that actually exists. It\u2019s easy to be an armchair policy maker from a position of hindsight where you don\u2019t have to watch the unforeseen consequences of your actions play out. If in some way I\u2019m being an apologist for anti-intellectualism, I could just as easily call you an apologist for bad history.\n\nOne of my original points was that you\u2019re never going to eliminate every possible vector for disease spread. People still need basic survival goods, which means supply lines need to stay open, as do distribution and production facilities. \u201cEssential businesses\u201d remain staffed and readily available to the public, who still have to go there in large numbers. Hopefully compliant with masking, sanitation, and distancing requirements, but still moving in large numbers. While all three of these things were generally effective means of preventing disease spread, they are not 100% effective. You\u2019re still going to have some people get sick, but hopefully yes, not 1,000,000 dead.\n\nNow imagine you do take it a step further and in the name of preventing those 1,000,000 dead, you start arresting non-compliant people. We have an example of how well that kind of restrictive policy is going at the moment in Shanghai, but let\u2019s assume it actually works. You have all your non-compliants locked up in the same place where disease will no doubt be spreading and putting other people, such as prison staff and their families, at risk of exposure. Can you say with certainty what happens next? We never had a way of predicting where mutations would come from or what they would do, and [scientists were even surprised by omicron](https://news.sky.com/story/amp/covid-19-scientists-surprised-by-properties-of-omicron-variant-says-nervtag-expert-12500712) and the [BA.2 subvariant](https://www.science.org/content/article/sudden-rise-more-transmissible-form-omicron-catches-scientists-surprise). So, can you or anybody else be sure that some new variant wouldn\u2019t emerge from your prisons or containment centers or whatever you want to call them? What do you do to prevent that? We\u2019ve already escalated to arresting people, do we suspend all right to due process and start the executions? Maybe you\u2019ll get your million dead after all\u2026\n\nAnd finally, I\u2019ll ask again: What about countries that did have more stringent pandemic responses, like Australia, New Zealand, and now China? Did those measures ultimately shorten the length of the pandemic for them? \n\nYou could possibly make the argument that the effectiveness of their response was mitigated by ineffective responses in other countries. More deadly and contagious variants spread from other countries which made containing the virus even harder. But a lopsided international response was always going to be a problem. You can only legislate for your own country. Even when most countries were closed to non-essential travel, virus variants still spread globally in a matter of months if not weeks. Can we maintain a food supply even when essential travel is prevented? We\u2019re having a hard enough time with that as it is. Even if you do manage to block all legal travel, illegal entry remains a vector for disease spread. So you commit extra resources toward border control and accept all known and unknown consequences which might come with that, just like we accepted whatever ones might come with imprisoning people. \n\nI\u2019m not saying that there was no marginally effective way to contain the pandemic, and I\u2019m also not saying that governments and individuals didn\u2019t find a way to somehow make it a hell of a lot worse. Of course there was a way, and of course we made it worse. But I am saying that you are not going to change human nature. More pandemics are going to come because COVID-19 was only the first of however many thousands of plagues our species has been hit with since we first began to live in close proximity to one another. Disease is a fact of life and a fact of history. Without total control, which you will never have, you can\u2019t stop it. We seem to think we\u2019re better than our ancestors, or at least smarter than them. We\u2019re not: We have better tools, but we\u2019re still just as bad at using them as we always were. You say it all could\u2019ve been prevented if our politicians hadn\u2019t fumbled if not outright sabotaged the pandemic response. I say that for them to have done so was inevitable.\n\nThe one thing it would require to make your vision possible is the one thing we can\u2019t have: Complete control over unpredictable forces.

We just don\u2019t like being told what to do.\n\nMy point was that it\u2019s overly optimistic to think that every private citizen would have followed guidelines to the letter. No matter how tough they were, no matter how \u201ccommon sense\u201d they seemed to be. *Public* citizens didn\u2019t even follow them: My own state governor was caught pushing tables together at a restaurant so her party of twelve friends could all sit together \u2014 in violation of her own administration\u2019s social-distancing regulations. Even countries that had more stringent lockdowns like Australia and New Zealand continued to deal with the pandemic as long as everybody else. Nevertheless, my comments had nothing to do with policy but everything to do with getting absolutely everybody to actually follow policy \u2014 something which no effort shy of divine intervention could have effected.

Opinion is often based on personal sentiments and taste, which you can't really convince somebody to adopt. For example, there's no logical argument that can convince me to like a song you like. I have to like that song myself by listening to it and finding that it suits my tastes. But we're not talking about personal tastes here, we're talking about a belief system which is at least ostensibly grounded in more than just \"because I like it that way.\"\n\nAn *argument* becomes credible through its basis in factual evidence. Again, Trump's stances on many things aren't suddenly valid because he sat in the Oval Office for four years. His background might furnish him with the ability to prove certain points, but his background itself would never be sufficient proof of anything.\n\n>2nd, I made no such blanket statements about Catholics. I made a blanket statement about the republican party but not Catholics. The dude didn't have a legitimate response so he just said your not catholic, like that matters since I wasn't making a statement about all Catholics. \n\n>3rd, dude was upset that I proved some of the catholic church is extremely partisan. But he says that doesn't matter because I am not catholic. So I noticed something about his church and he didn't like what was noticed. Not sure how that matters but ok.\n\nYou said...\n\n\"Awe, yes, the same priests that want to strip Biden of the eucharist in an obvious partisan attack. Kinda hard to seperate the religious with the GOP nowadays.\"\n\nFeel free to correct me if I'm wrong (though your third comment seems to imply that I'm right), but to my eye this reads as \"Catholic priests are enforcing GOP politics.\" The accusation doesn't seem to fall on the GOP here for having those policies, it seems to fall on Catholics who take it into their own hands to enforce the Catholic Church's very explicitly pro-life teachings -- which it teaches globally, regardless of what the GOP thinks. I mean, that the catechism of the Catholic Church is explicitly against abortion is not debatable to you, right?\n\nEven so, I think the point was the guy saw absolutely no reason to continue to engage with you in a serious way because your argument was not serious -- at a certain point you fell back to feels. There are arguments to be made here, you're just not making them. So why would anybody take what you're saying seriously?\n\nAgain, like I said above, there's even argument from canon law to be made here: The priests in question here based their attempt to excommunicate Joe Biden on the canon law which requires excommunication to those who furnish people with abortions. According to the priests, to create legislation which increases access to abortion is violation of this law. So they took it into their own hands to act. How legitimate their own individual actions were is debatable, but canon law here seems pretty clear: People who furnish abortions are to be denied communion.\n\nSo there are obvious grounds to what those priests chose to do which have nothing to do with partisan alignment, you just didn't care enough to refute that. And when somebody questioned your credibility -- since, again, no part of your argument was grounded in factuality -- you tried to ground your credibility in \"who you know\" versus \"what you know.\" That's where what you're saying lost all meaning and that's where the person you were trying to talk to stopped taking you seriously.", "created_utc": "1652757813.0", "edited": "False", "id": "i8wktfr", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_ur5mq9", "parent_id": "t1_i8wja38", "score": "3", "subreddit": "prolife", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qscv"}, {"author": "bookem_danno", "body": "But that's not what you did at any point in this exchange, you just made a blanket statement: Some Catholic priests threatened to exocmmunicate Biden et. al over abortion (which, by the way, you never actually clarified whether that was a valid stance for them to take; there is actually an argument to be made for it from canon law but, hey, whatever man). This must mean that in some way the Catholic Church is reflecting back GOP policy, which anybody can see is a patently ridiculous line of thinking. Then, when called out by a practicing Catholic, you rested your defense on people you know who happen to be Catholic.\n\nMaybe you had a good argument to make here, but you harpooned it by trying to prove it by appeal to authorities which don't actually have that much authority.\n\nI *would* ask an ex-president about policy if I believed his knowledge of policy qualified him, not merely because he held the title of president. Would you ever ask Trump for policy expertise?\n\n>You may not be catholic but you know enough to have an opinion on their bullshit and to act like your opinion isn't valid is acting like priests didn't molest kids while their bishops covered it up.\n\nI'm not even sure how that analogy makes sense here.

It\u2019s just a clump of cells, it\u2019s not really alive, it\u2019s not human, etc.\n\nSo essentially, because the governing attribute is something we can\u2019t even define, in the end the decision that an unborn child is or isn\u2019t human becomes completely arbitrary. That\u2019s why, to some, abortion is suddenly no longer okay as soon as the child passes through the magical birth canal; while to others, varying different stages of development (detectable heartbeat, brain activity, ability to feel pain, etc.) are the borderline. In other words, nobody really knows, so rather than take the logical next step and protect human rights at every possible stage of development, they just throw their hands up in the air and say some slogan like \u201cno uterus, no opinion; my body, my choice, etc.\u201d \n\nIf consciousness is what makes a human, human, and consciousness is undefinable, it\u2019s not that big a leap to assume all sorts of other people aren\u2019t conscious humans.

This is not her using him, this is her desiring to keep what she thought was a strong friendship and nothing else. How realistic that is will be up to the two of them, but there's no shame in them trying.\n\nAt the same time, unrequited love is a powerful feeling and it's not unreasonable to think that OP might be burdened by it.

And that Kingdom is more important than this world. But you know, this world is still important, and God doesn't want us to be miserable here either.\n\nPart of the wonder of the incarnation is that God took on every aspect of human nature in order to save it. That means that Jesus had to have known the whole range of human emotions, including and perhaps most evidently pain, disappointment, loss, betrayal, sorrow, confusion. If God Himself felt these things, surely it's okay for us to feel them too.\n\n>Therefore I say unto you, Be not anxious for your life, what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink; nor yet for your body, what ye shall put on. Is not the life more than the food, and the body than the raiment? Behold the birds of the heaven, that they sow not, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns; and your heavenly Father feedeth them. Are not ye of much more value than they? And which of you by being anxious can add one cubit unto the measure of his life? And why are ye anxious concerning raiment? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin: yet I say unto you, that even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these. But if God doth so clothe the grass of the field, which to-day is, and to-morrow is cast into the oven, shall he not much more clothe you, O ye of little faith? Be not therefore anxious, saying, What shall we eat? or, What shall we drink? or, Wherewithal shall we be clothed? For after all these things do the Gentiles seek; for your heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things. But seek ye first his kingdom, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you. Be not therefore anxious for the morrow: for the morrow will be anxious for itself. Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof. (Matthew 6:25-34)\n\nTell me where in that famous, important, and meaningful passage it ever says \"don't worry about these things because you don't actually need them\"? It doesn't, rather what it says is that you can trust in God for everything you will need in this earthly life. You do need these things, and God knows it, because God knows that this world is important: Otherwise why would He have saved it and us? For that reason, you can be sure that God will take care of you in this life as well and that He knows exactly what you are dealing with right now.

Most of the young women I teach with, or have encountered while visiting other schools (I was recently job-hunting so I guest-taught and interviewed at a couple places around the country in the last 18 months or so) are already married. Surprise surprise, the cultural expectation that Christian men and women get married younger than the rest of the population does show itself in force. To be fair, I haven't been to too many Catholic schools, but I'd imagine the trend is reflected there as well.\n\nMore importantly, remember that as a teacher your first duty at your job is to your students, and they're also the people you'll be spending most of your weekdays with. If Mr. pressYesforchicken ends up dating Ms. CuteCatholicSchoolTeacher, you don't want them to know about it*: I teach middle schoolers and high schoolers and the rumor mill is very real. Staff aren't necessarily above petty gossip either, even in a Christian school.\n\nAll of the usual risks of dating a coworker are also present. What happens if you break up and aren't able to work together comfortably anymore? Not only is it awkward, but it's awkward while making sure that the young people under your charge are getting access to the best education you can give them. Do you feel like you can maintain professionalism and make sure students aren't aware of it?\n\nI like a pretty high wall between my work life and my personal life. Unfortunately I can't think of a less vulgar expression for it than \"don't dip your pen in the company ink\" but that's basically my philosophy. If you don't feel that way, feel free to disregard the above. These are my two cents, but I do present them as an experienced teacher.\n\n*I originally said you don't \"necessarily\" want them to know about it but, no, I think it should be totally clear that you don't want students to know about it at all. My students are aware that I have a girlfriend, but we don't work together, so it's less of a big deal. But if you have students who know that you're dating a coworker who also teaches them, their siblings, or their friends, they will: A. Never stop asking you about it. And B.

We started as language partners, became best friends, and a romance proceeded out of that friendship.

I think there is something to be said for the pressure they pour on at the very beginning, before you have any real bond to carry you through the distance.\n\nI think what worked for my girlfriend and I was that we already had something solid before we tried to make it a romance. I'll be the first to admit that it was a bit risky and not always easy: Dating best friends can end poorly, and so can long distance. But we both sincerely believe that the bond we formed before we even had the chance to meet in person (took almost a year because of COVID) is why we are able to have what we have today.\n\nSo my advice to you is to just focus on getting to know her, come what may.

Rather, they were united into a brand new jurisdiction which is just called the [Orthodox Church of Ukraine (OCU)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthodox_Church_of_Ukraine).\n\nAt the direction of the Patriarch of Constantinople, the UAOC and the UOC-KP met at the end of 2018 to elect a leader and subsequently picked Epiphanius I. Autocephaly was formally granted by Constantinople at this point, but there are still two functioning Churches with overlapping jurisdiction in Ukraine: The UOC (recognized by Constantinople, Alexandria, Cyprus, and Greece) and the Ukrainian Orthodox Church - Moscow Patriarchate (recognized by everybody else).\n\nWhere it gets even *weirder* is that the old guy who had been leader of the UOC-KP, Patriarch Filaret, actually decided to *revoke his signature* from the agreement later on. He currently claims that his Church still exists and has not been legally liquidated into the Orthodox Church of Ukraine. I'm unaware of how many supporters he actually has there. Wikipedia says 100,000 as of 2019, but there's no citation given.

If there was anything which seemed disingenuous in my original post, it wasn't intentional. As a rather embattled Orthodox Christian myself, I'm only working with the information I have. I welcome correction if you have a better understanding.\n\nMy understanding was that there were two schismatic groups which have their origins in Soviet times. Both groups arose out of the Ukrainian desire for total independence from Russia, not a difference in theology. \n\nThe EP has a status of \"first among equals\" within the Church and does have some right to adjudicate theological disputes, but that's plainly not what's going on here.\n\nTo the best of my knowledge, the two groups were granted autocephaly at the same time and instructed to work out their own differences to become one united church. That process was also messy and involved some bickering over who would be the head of the united church.\n\n>I must not be used to christian rhetoric, then, because it seemed like only the Russians and Polish were outspokenly opposed to the decision. Even then, the Polish church was not opposed to Ukraine being autocephalous as far as I can tell, they just think that Constantinople shouldn't have forced it through like they did.\n\nI know the Serbs were also critical of the decision, but that should hardly come as a surprise. In any case, I know several heads of the autocephalous churches came forth asking for conciliarity on the issue and not unilateral action. Hierarchs (but not heads) of the Churches have also spoken out on their own. Maybe that's not as critical as you might expect, but internally it's a big deal. Very few Churches have thus far recognized the autocephaly of the OCU. Inaction on the part of the other Churches, who have now had nearly four years to make some kind of statement, speaks as loud as action.\n\n>I do not believe that the Russian Orthodox Church is an independent entity from the Russian government. As such, I believe that the schism is at least heavily based on secular politics.\n\nComing back to this, the close ties of the Russian Orthodox Church and the Russian state are more than alarming, particularly to those of us who desire no ties to that state. If I had an answer to you on how I as an individual plan to handle that, I would give it. I didn't join out of a love for Russia, but out of a thorough belief in this Church's theology. \n\nNevertheless, I'm just not sure what else Patriarch Kirill was supposed to do in this situation. Let it go? Again, the EP is not a Pope. Let me be clear that I don't think the Russian state let a good crisis go to waste here. But isn't it more likely that Kirill was acting in defense of his Church first and foremost, and that those interests happened to match with the aims of the Russian state? This is the tragedy behind either side applying an ecclesial-theological solution to a secular-political problem. \n\nAs a final point, I don't disagree that there probably should be a canonically autocephalous Ukrainian Church, because \"Russkiy Mir\" is pretty damn far from our actual doctrines.

Is the idea of dating even on her radar and is it something approved-of by the family?

I found this post interesting so I wanted to chime in. Hope that's okay! :)\n\nThe whole point of the chosen people, the law, the prophets, and everything in the Old Testament was to prepare a savage world for the coming of Christ.\n\nFirst and foremost, there had to be a culture on earth which was capable of producing a woman able to give birth to the Son of God. That woman was Mary.\n\nAfter that, there had to exist a group of people who would know who the Messiah was, recognize Him, and follow Him at all costs.\n\nBut God also knew that even His chosen people were fallen, and that many among them would not only fail to recognize His Son, but also reject Him. Not only does this play out in real time with every incident in which the Hebrews turned away from Yahweh and worshiped strange gods, but it's also prefigured in stories throughout the Old Testament and New Testament. Think of Esau losing his birthright for a bowl of stew or the many parables Jesus tells of people who are given something special only to lose it and have it given to somebody else. This is why the Church is now the true chosen people and not the Jews.\n\nThrow in the ingenious infrastructure generously and unwittingly provided by the Romans and you end up with a religion that not only has staying power, but also the ability to spread quickly over long distances. It's also no coincidence that those same Romans pulled down the Second Temple brick-by-brick one generation after Christ's death and resurrection. The historical timing of the rise of Christianity is incredible!\n\nBrutality secured the existence of the Hebrew people in a brutal age. Again, God is bringing a people out of savagery so that a few of them may be prepared to know His Son for who He was and ensure the spread and survival of His message to humanity. The Hebrews began as barbarians surrounded by even worse barbarians. Whatever they inflicted upon their enemies would have been done ten times over to them. The ancient world was a strange place, where men often acted more like animals than human beings. Look at what the men of Sodom wanted to do to God's own angels in the Book of Genesis.

Both were pretty devout (dad increasingly so, as he got to know my mom) so they never cohabited or anything in that time, but that's still a really long time to wait. I remember thinking that that was totally normal when I was a lot younger, but in hindsight... maybe not. Thankfully I don't have to figure out whatever it is he was figuring out at that age.\n\nCommunication between my parents (and really within our family in general) is also sometimes a problem. Dad likes to solve problems, mom just wants to be listened to and doesn't always take criticism well (granted, the criticism is not always what's asked for). It's taken some time for them to figure that out and it still doesn't always come out right. It was a habit I also carried into the early stages of my own relationship and took a little while to get over.\n\nUltimately though, it's a happy marriage and I don't try to look real hard at the less-than-perfect parts. I'm sure my kids will look back on my own marriage one day and have critiques of their own.

Since roughly 2% of the genome of humans of Eurasian descent is derived from Neanderthal ancestry, I\u2019m inclined to believe this and, if I were forced to speculate, I\u2019d be inclined to believe that Neanderthals are also people. But I\u2019m not an anthropologist and, again, the question isn\u2019t especially relevant.\n\nYour response is still dancing around the essential question of what exactly consciousness is and how to recognize it. You make this clear by putting forth the fuzzy definition of being somewhat more advanced than a chicken or an ant (I.E - like many, many animals). So why stop there? If we can essentially be reduced into believing that certain people are not actually people just because we don\u2019t like them/their existence isn\u2019t convenient/we\u2019re at war with them, anything goes. Consciousness can\u2019t be the only thing that defines a person if we have no real solid explanation of what it actually is. Humans must be humans no matter what, and all humans must therefore be persons. There\u2019s no other consistent definition.\n\nWith that in mind, I\u2019m not sure why you think that this is some kind of zero-sum game where just because one group has a right, it means another group doesn\u2019t. Everybody has the right to life, born or unborn. Yes, I am pro-life, but I also believe that an abortion should be performed in a case where the mother is at serious risk of death. Why? Because women have the right to life, like any other human at any stage of development. But each person having the right to life no more infringes on the rights of women in particular than it infringes on the rights of anybody who would kill somebody for whatever other reason. Rights are protections from threats to self or property \u2014 not licenses to a certain course of action.", "created_utc": "1647398812.0", "edited": "False", "id": "i0u5cmy", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_tetsju", "parent_id": "t1_i0u1bsc", "score": "2", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i"}, {"author": "bookem_danno", "body": "Wasn\u2019t it extremely common for people to be entombed in medieval cathedrals?

Give people the right propaganda and they\u2019ll very willingly believe that even their own neighbors are unfeeling, unconscious, inhuman monsters. If you make that the benchmark for what makes somebody a person, there\u2019s absolutely no reason why it can\u2019t be manipulated in whatever direction and for whatever reason. Again, the only consistent marker is in that every human remains a human from conception until death. Everything else is essentially arbitrary.\n\nFor a more imminent example than the Neanderthals, what about extant great apes like chimpanzees and gorillas? Both have complex social structures, exhibit signs of self-awareness, and have even shown capability with language. Great ape personhood is a long-standing debate.
