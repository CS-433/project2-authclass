I mean, how many people take 4+ years of Spanish in middle/high school, but can only remember basic greetings and ask where the library is?\n\nEdit: there\u2019s some discussion about if fault should be placed on the students or the teachers, so maybe this will help. I\u2019ve always been a language enthusiast, I\u2019m currently a military linguist. Went to the defense language institute for both Arabic and Mandarin, and I\u2019m able to work in both comfortably. Obviously my training was very different from the public school system, but I still feel somewhat qualified to speak on language education in a general, armchair redditor sense at the very least. In my four years of Spanish we barely journeyed outside basic conversation and survival skills. The course material I had in middle/high moved at a glacial pace, translating single sentences and using the same basic vocab, and most of the time in the classroom you\u2019d hear more English being spoken than the target language. If the US public school system can take students from simple arithmetic to calculus, I see no reason students shouldn\u2019t be able to read news articles with relative comfort after studying the language for so long. There\u2019s a fundamental flaw where perfection gets in the way, trying to rote memorize grammar patterns in theory and drilling genders/conjugation/etc. to the extent students\u2019 eyes glaze over and they lose interest. If every time I accidentally use \u201cser\u201d instead of \u201cestar\u201d my teacher stops and makes me start over, I\u2019m not gaining fluency or confidence, on the contrary I\u2019m getting resentful for not being able to finish expressing my thoughts in the target language. Language can\u2019t be taught like a hard science because it\u2019s not one, and small mistakes like that will smooth out with more practice and expansion beyond the narrow scope that students are working in.
