If you just want to hit a certain level on paper as like a trophy type thing 'Look at my A2 cert' then probably smashing it out and moving onto something else is better.", "created_utc": "1632633138.0", "edited": "False", "id": "heb8kyu", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_pvjd9n", "parent_id": "t3_pvjd9n", "score": "2", "subreddit": "German", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qq51"}, {"author": "gily69", "body": "Hmm i'll keep searching, I mean I wouldn't be starting from A1 anyway.

Funny thing is 99% of the doctors there trained in the western European countries (or the UK). He was only a 3rd year so he hasn't even experienced medicine there yet.\n\nI'm UK btw but you're 100% right. The American system has been monetized and become brutal but because of this they have absolutely excellent resources and get a fantastic educational experience. Sounds like all hospitals in the US have top of the line facilities, whereas over here we get 0 interesting patients because they all get referred to the few hospitals capable of treating difficult cases. My paeds rotation was 99% vaccinations and checkups - I had 1 uncommon case in 5 weeks.\n\nFunny thing is we all suffer equally, yes the US students are studying 24/7 but so is every other med student. My class studies 24/7 because we have no fucking clue what they're gonna ask us. In the US they study 24/7 because they know exactly what's coming and are aware of how much info they need to know to pass each USMLE exam.\n\nThat student was clearly jealous of the US and why wouldn't he be. All med students put in the same hours globally basically except American med students get the best deal purely because the goddam salaries are so fucking high and they get straight into specialty training. In the UK we're expected to work overtime and not take pay for it because we're in medicine to help people, this is so serious that it's actually taken into account when you apply for a specialty - \"oh he took his OT pay\".

US students just end up getting better compensated for it and they get a world class education in the process because it has been so monetized that the competition has become so fierce that you get world renown products being produced like B&B and pathoma etc which students from all over the world use instead of there in house lectures.

However up to you to figure out what works for you.\n\nInstead of watching TV etc you should start reading IMO, use [wattpad.com](https://wattpad.com) I think reading is much more beneficial at your level (it's fantastic at all levels) mainly because you can pace yourself, you can search up the words, see the structure and verbalize the structure either in your head or via speech. Doesn't matter if you understand what you're reading or not. Watch Tv once you have a bit of a base.

I don't need to think of the English then translate it in my head (for thoughts etc), the German is just there is what I mean.\n\nI also don't bother to 'learn' grammar, instead I just try to pick it up, like I have no idea what the perfekt tense, dative, accusative, indefinite article etc all means really (obviously I have some basic idea just from doing exercises) but I just learn 'ok this is how you say this' then substitute words basically, just how I learnt my English, I have no fucking clue about English grammar yet i'm a native.", "created_utc": "1628624141.0", "edited": "False", "id": "h8g47f5", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_p1q15c", "parent_id": "t1_h8g2v3b", "score": "4", "subreddit": "German", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qq51"}, {"author": "gily69", "body": "What specialty?

Make sure you always choose to write out the answers rather than the flash card option as well.\n\nI play Skyrim in German - Any sentences I take and put them into anki so I can learn, I do this so that I can essentially try play with the sentences later and experiment with the language e.g In game a character might say\"the weather is looking bad today\", so i'll take that a try extend it to the weather isn't looking very good, it might rain then i'll have my German friend correct my sentence.\n\nI do the same with twitch streamers - it's excellent to not only listen to the streamer and learn through immersion basically but also I copy and paste messages people write into the chat into anki. E.g Worum geht es in dem spiel?\n\nOnce i'm done with Busuu i'll be using the Grammar Aktiv book (already done a couple lessons)\n\nI listen to German radio all day - same theory/reason as watching the streamers.\n\nFor speaking I just read every single thing out that I do out loud.

As I start to hit B2 i'll be using an Italki tutor to get fully conversational up to my current language level.\n\nSo in summary, do full immersion, do some actual study - grammar etc, play some games  where you have to figure out the task and watch streamers because it's like your hanging out with a German.\n\nI've made extremely good progress in my opinion, I've probably only done \\~100 or so hours of actual German not counting the 'passive' hours of listening to the radio or watching streamers.", "created_utc": "1627624244.0", "edited": "1627624646.0", "id": "h71vylw", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_oubycw", "parent_id": "t3_oubycw", "score": "7", "subreddit": "German", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qq51"}, {"author": "gily69", "body": "Yes lol he was making a joke (we're both in Medizin).", "created_utc": "1627583371.0", "edited": "False", "id": "h6ziw8n", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_otrcns", "parent_id": "t1_h6za84o", "score": "1", "subreddit": "German", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qq51"}, {"author": "gily69", "body": "It seems reasonable so far, the biggest plus for me is just how short the lessons are but then it'll hit you with 'weak grammar' exercises etc to build on these short lessons at a later date, so it keeps you moving forward but doesn't let you get too far ahead.", "created_utc": "1627561109.0", "edited": "False", "id": "h6y4le6", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_otrcns", "parent_id": "t1_h6y3qqu", "score": "2", "subreddit": "German", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qq51"}, {"author": "gily69", "body": "You have plenty of time so don't stress, you're allowed days off lol. I watch a ton of twitch streamers in German aka I immerse myself in it, I prefer the react streamers simply because that's more useful to actually improving my German as opposed to watching some highly specific gameplay commentary. I've found I naturally pick up things using this method sayings etc and it just really pounds the sentence structure etc into your brain.\n\nI also just started Busuu last week and I really enjoy it so far, there's so many lessons its crazy and they're quite short <5 mins which I find to be the perfect amount of time as I used babbel previously but things just got so repetitive and it took forever to finish an exercise. I also use Busuu as a bit of a competition, my goal is to be rank 1 on the league thing, so I constantly push myself to do more and more. That's just me though, i've played sports all my life etc and I love competition. Busuu does claim to get you to B2 level which could potentially be true as their A1 has 95 lessons lol so it's quite thorough (I'm currently 70% through the A1 lessons just making sure I get through the whole app, you can take a placement test but I knew A1 wouldn't take me long so I figured i'll just start from the beginning.)\n\nIn summary, Immersion + exercises.\n\nFor reference my German has been deemed B1 'with a stroke' :D by natives", "created_utc": "1627560137.0", "edited": "1627560667.0", "id": "h6y30of", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_otrcns", "parent_id": "t3_otrcns", "score": "3", "subreddit": "German", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qq51"}, {"author": "gily69", "body": "I agree, instead of \"forgive all loans\" how about \"forgive all interest\".", "created_utc": "1627545750.0", "edited": "False", "id": "h6xl3qa", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_otae92", "parent_id": "t1_h6xkbni", "score": "2", "subreddit": "Residency", "subreddit_id": "t5_2t8qv"}, {"author": "gily69", "body": "Contrary to what nearly all pre-meds will tell you (don't forget you can't say this in interviews) is that Medicine is perfectly fine to enter for the money. It is after all just another job and is I assume the most sure fired way to enter the top 1% in terms of wealth. We work 10000x harder than any other profession on this earth and then get shit on and fed propaganda that we shouldn't take pay rises etc because we 'do it for the people' meanwhile the hospital executives make millions a year. I'm about to start residency aka receive my first 'real' pay check meanwhile all of my non-medical friends own multiple houses etc. So the payoff for medicine is long term, aka once you hit attending but until then you're surviving off peanuts. You're job will be secure however and you will have immense freedom to pick and choose your work and where you work. So weigh all these things up.\n\nIt doesn't really matter what your reason for wanting to do medicine is, you can be the social warrior who says I love helping people etc or you can do it for the money or just do it for the academic challenge. Don't let anybody judge your reason for wanting to enter. Half my class have gone from social justice and helping people to 'dude fuck this, it's so much suffering and work that I just want to make money'.\n\nYou can get into medical devices if you wish, you may like radiology; it has physics and stuff.\n\nShadow as many different types of Physicians as you can and form a view of if you could enjoy their job.\n\nThe do-gooder feel of medicine does wear off as you quickly realise you care more about the patients health than they do - non compliant patients basically.
