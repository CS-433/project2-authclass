Just because Russian state media brags they have \u201ccool\u201d new hypersonic missiles , does not mean the whole MAD balance is in needing of severe restructuring, so much so that the west need to start a conflict with Russia to get new geographic footholds. As if we don\u2019t have the tools to counter strike with our current NATO geographic positions. The premise is insane. \n\nThe thing about the west, is that we don\u2019t brag openly with propaganda pieces about the power of our nuclear arsenal to the public/other countries. That\u2019s lame dictator shit you do when you have a weaker hand. And that\u2019s what Russia has done.\n\nThis has very little to do with nuclear rebalancing and everything to do with Putin\u2019s semi-justified paranoia about the western tendency to support pro-democratic regime change around the world. \n\nFrom Putin\u2019s perspective the west has already invaded Ukraine. He\u2019s watching a nation the contains many Russian speaking citizens from the former Soviet Union openly embrace western values, and slip away from Russian control/influence forever. Like a permanent sore on the mouth of the Russian identity/culture right on their doorstep. From Putin\u2019s perspective the Ukrainian people were manipulated by the ideology of the west, when they revolted against the former Russian backed Ukrainian government in 2015. To Putin the whole thing was a western psyop. \n\nBut the reality is\u2026 drum roll\u2026 the Ukrainian people just wanted democracy. People wanted a better economy and cooperation with EU. Yes the west helped the revolution, but at the end of the day it was a spontaneous revolution by the Ukrainian people, and ultimately what they wanted. But Putin sees the whole scenario like an extension of western meddling a la, Libya or Syria. Where we are the destabilizing force in the world, and use \u201cdemocracy\u201d to justify regime change. Again, there is a sad reality here that is semi-justified, and the west has bamboozled nearly every pro democratic intervention ever. So Putin is a bit justified. \n\nSo the encroachment of democratic ideals is a literal existential threat to Putin\u2019s power. What if the Russian people start clamoring for democratic ideals? What if the whispers of pro-western regime change begins to take hold in Russia, and a real movement begins. What if the west backs more separatists in his own country. For Putin that would be a doomsday scenario, and would be the beginning of the end for his whole life\u2019s work. If Putin loses the anti-west narrative battle with the Russian population , Russia\u2019s stability collapses. So he projects power , creates conflict, stirs trouble with the west. He needs the narrative to exist to maintain stability in his own country. \n\nPutin needs/wants to bring this massive population of Russian speaking people back into his sphere of influence, and he\u2019ll use any tactic to meet this goal. The current state of affairs and border between east and west is too loose. He can feel the democratic pro-western destabilizing forces literally seeping through the current geographic boundary. Russian speaking Ukrainians can blend into Russian society easily, creating a literal intelligence nightmare for western infiltrators/agents. \n\nThis military buildup is a signal to all of the nations along Russia\u2019s border \u201cPlay by our rules, or face constant suffocating pressure from the Russian edges of your country.\u201d \n\nIt\u2019s also a signal to the Russian people, that the idealogy of NATO / West is so dangerous, that it needs a hard border and bloodshed to prevent the inflow of ideology/people. And they\u2019ll use any propaganda narrative to meet this goal. \n\nIt\u2019s also a signal to the west that if they attempt to meddle in the affairs of any other country along Russian border (Belarus/Kazakstan/etc) or Russia itself , that they will make our life literal hell , so we should just give up on the whole spreading democracy thing, and mainly let Putin keep his brand of stabilized control of Russia. \n\nThe NATO nuclear restabilization shit and posturing missles  , is just what Putin projects to media because he can\u2019t openly say \u201cStop spreading democracy near us, it makes controlling Russia difficult\u201d. Too on the nose. So he creates these convoluted narratives to convince people like you that , the whole affair is really some nuclear chess match and Putin is the intelligent moderating force that wants stability, when in reality he just wants to remain Tsar of Russia and is betting that a conflict with the west may be a necessary to consolidate that control.", "created_utc": "1644756031.0", "edited": "1644756425.0", "id": "hwrs74e", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_sqi7sr", "parent_id": "t1_hwohoa0", "score": "6", "subreddit": "collapse", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhw9"}, {"author": "Pristine_Switch_1370", "body": "Lol.
