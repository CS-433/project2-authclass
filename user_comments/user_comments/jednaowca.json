Working with devs directly is often better than working for translation agencies (the rates are better when you cut out the middleman, and devs tend to credit the translators when asked, while agencies way too often decide to just not credit their translators at all). Somebody wanting to translate your game is definitely not a scam by itself, that happens.\n\nI understand that the part that confuses you the most is that they want to do this for free. Getting your foot in the door in this business can be hard (especially for less popular languages), so many aspiring translators try to translate some indie games for free to have something for their portfolio to apply for actual paid jobs later. This is, obviously, not a great thing (I believe people should be paid for their work), but that's how it is right now, sadly.\n\nMy guess is that it's not a scam, but this person is not a professional translator (the fact that they want to do this for free, and that they want to use Word for it, is quite telling).\n\nPersonally I don't recommend making people translate your game for free - it's quite exploitative (just like wanting free work from an artist or a programmer), but also hiring somebody with no experience means you're not getting this kind of service you'd get from a good agency or a professional who knows what they're doing. If that's not a big deal to you and your game is small and doesn't have much text, this could be a deal beneficial to both you and the translator, provided you credit them. But if your game is bigger than, say, a few hundred words, it could be quite a headache to deal with somebody who doesn't necessarily know what they're doing and you wouldn't have an easy way of knowing if the translation is good.\n\n(of course, it's not 100% impossible for this to be a scam - so do be careful with anything you give them, if you decide to do it)", "created_utc": "1660991606.0", "edited": "1660991925.0", "id": "il1uvjn", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_wsu904", "parent_id": "t3_wsu904", "score": "10", "subreddit": "gamedev", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qi0a"}, {"author": "jednaowca", "body": "Kontaktu na \u017cywo, czy ka\u017cdego, online te\u017c?

In theory the core sentence is ok, word order and all, but there are two main problems:\n\n1. \\[X\\] is going to be in the nominative case (unless you prepare variations, but hardly anybody does that, and I definitely understand why), but for the sentence to be correct you'd need genitive.\n2. Gender. If all characters are male (or if all are female - but that hardly ever happens), there's no problem. If some are male and some are female, things get difficult, because some of the stuff you're using as \\[Y\\] is gendered, and \"who\" would also be gendered in this sentence.\n\nStill, that's not impossible to deal with. I'm a game translator and if I had to work on something like this, I'd add some extra words in my translation, something that'd translate to \"The treasure is in this house, which belongs to the following character: \\[X\\], who \\[Y\\].\" This doesn't look quite as smooth as the English text, but it's grammatically correct. It could be a problem if your UI doesn't have enough space for longer text, though.\n\nAnyway, this is a very quick explanation, if your future translator thinks about it in more detail, they might be able to come up with something different, but I hope I answered your question to a satisfying degree :)", "created_utc": "1641417305.0", "edited": "1641417603.0", "id": "hrem3kz", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_rwrzny", "parent_id": "t3_rwrzny", "score": "3", "subreddit": "translator", "subreddit_id": "t5_2ss9z"}, {"author": "jednaowca", "body": "Bo\u017ce, mamy jak\u0105\u015b nadprogramowo wysok\u0105 produkcj\u0119 zjeb\u00f3w.

Maybe not annoys, but I personally don't like the features that feel like recreating stuff from real world, without thinking whether it belongs in The Sims or not. Stuff like the Eco Living pack (we know Sims have no global warming and industries ruining the environment, so it just feels pointless), Christmas-like holidays, vacation destinations that are modeled after real countries in The Sims 3... I like the more quirky/unique stuff more. I think The Sims 1 and 2 were the best in that regard, in The Sims 3 things started going a little downhill. This game is the best when it's being its own self, and not just trying to mimic real life too much.\n2. I think the community's need for cars, when the neighborhoods are so small and there's no use for them anyway, because there's no open world, is kind of American. I'm not really against it, but I feel like there's no real use for cars in The Sims 4, the way the game looks now.\n3.

In fact, now I'm going to write a long comment about my The Sims 4 feelings that nobody will read!\n\nI got an Origin subscription a month ago and it includes The Sims 3 (with Late Night expansion) and The Sims 4 (no expansions, but I got the Parenthood one) . I started with The Sims 4 and quit quickly, because I was disappointed. I played The Sims 3 for a while, it was fun, but after going back to The Sims 4 I'm actually enjoying it. Some things I really like:\n\n\\- the Sims themselves look better than ever. I forgot how hard it is to make a nice looking Sim in The Sims 3 - the hairstyles for women, especially, are nearly all horrible, and children just never look cute - and of course, most Sims in The Sims 2 just look... questionable, no matter what you do.  In The Sims 4 I can spend hours in CAS (even with the limited number of clothes available, as I have no expansion packs) and every time I'm just so in love with how pretty my Sims end up looking.\n\n\\- that thing that lets you edit the families in your neighbourhood without playing them is AMAZING and I feel having something like this would fix a lot of my Sims 3 issues - my biggest problem with TS3 was that as I was playing, focusing on one or two families, the entire town around me would just slowly grow old and die, which really kills any roleplaying enthusiasm I had (and changing families resets the saved wants, so it's best to be avoided if you have long term goals for your Sims). Being able to add children to neighbourhood families is just \\*chef's kiss\\*. Now the town actually has some history instead of being a revolving door of new families moving in to replace the dead people.\n\n\\- toddlers are the best they've ever been in the series. They can do so many things (and look adorable while doing so), and the current skill system is much more realistic and fun to use and watch than the 3 skills they could learn in TS2 and TS3. I'm hoping TS3 Generations offers something at least slightly similar, but I don't have that expansion pack yet. The fact that they can just feed themselves with any food in their reach is not super realistic, but it is A LIFESAVER.\n\n\\- multitasking. I remember when it was being advertised as the biggest new thing in TS4 before it came out and I also remember thinking \"who cares\". Then when I first played the game I didn't even notice it at first. But it really adds so much life to Sims' lives. I can have my child Sim sit on the bed and do her homework while chatting with her toddler sister who's eating something, and this just looks so cute and feels so real.\n\n\\- the new party system. I like being given tasks to do (even if some of them are annoying - the toast thing, especially, or anything to do with drinks when my family lives in a small home with no space for a bar), in the old games whether the party was good or bad often felt super subjective. And the costume party thing will never not crack me up.\n\nthere's more, but this comment is already way too long, sorry \\^\\^'\n\nThere's also a lot of stuff I don't like, of course, but overall I'm pleasantly surprised by how much fun I'm having.\n\nAlso, I've been playing The Sims 2 a few months ago, and while it's still an amazing game, I was surprised to discover that the aspiration system is not as great as I remembered it. It's not well-balanced, the number of aspirations feels really limiting and I kept getting the same or really annoying wants (and ignoring them is not an option if I want my Sims to be happy).", "created_utc": "1591447011.0", "edited": "1591447218.0", "id": "ft42q3j", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_gxjins", "parent_id": "t3_gxjins", "score": "19", "subreddit": "thesims", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rbdu"}, {"author": "jednaowca", "body": "Yeah, purposefully annoying the person who is already really touchy seems like a weird thing for a \"mama bear\" to do.", "created_utc": "1590954019.0", "edited": "False", "id": "fsg9rmb", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_gu212a", "parent_id": "t1_fsg67r1", "score": "5", "subreddit": "ANTM", "subreddit_id": "t5_2scrx"}, {"author": "jednaowca", "body": "Aww, this is so sweet of you.

Opening Genki, reading it half-heartedly for 5 minutes and then surfing the Internet for half an hour does not count. The dumb thing I do when I study something, not necessarily Japanese, is having a long youtube video in the background. I pause it when I take a break and I unpause it when I get back to studying. This way I can see how much time I really spend studying and I can more easily reach the amount of hours of study I'm aiming at. Often people think they spend soooo much time studying but in reality they spend most of it procrastinating.\n\n* Genki is a good resource. It's not a problem with the textbook not being good enough. The \"I want the perfect resource\" is a trap many beginners fall into and it just leads to wasting time on searching for a better textbook. You just have to choose something and stick to it. \n\n* Make sure that you understand what you're reading - just skimming the chapter to get it over with as soon as possible is not going to help you learn. Write down the grammar points and vocab you're encountering and do the exercises.\n\n* Don't compare yourself to other people. I know it's hard, but saying \"others have N2 and know 4000 kanji\" (hardly anybody knows that many kanji, btw, you're exaggerating) is just not productive. With kanji, they probably just spent time memorizing it with flashcards or something similar (I know I did), because there's hardly any other way. This can be done by anybody with some time and discipline. There are no shortcuts for knowing Japanese, just putting a ton of hours into it.\n", "created_utc": "1546384522.0", "edited": "1546423482.0", "id": "ed1ke5d", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_abmkd3", "parent_id": "t3_abmkd3", "score": "12", "subreddit": "LearnJapanese", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qyls"}, {"author": "jednaowca", "body": "I missed the fact that he became a saint!

Can you recommend some good websites (can be in Spanish, I can understand it a little and it's good reading practice) with news from your country?\n\n2. Is there a way to help somehow? I know it's a silly and naive question, but are there maybe any trustworthy charities that could be donated to, or would the money not even reach the people who need it anyway?\n\n3. And one more question, unrelated to politics: Can you recommend some Venezuelan music or movies?\n\nI wish you all well.", "created_utc": "1515504505.0", "edited": "False", "id": "dseyhto", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_7p2ldv", "parent_id": "t3_7p2ldv", "score": "3", "subreddit": "vzla", "subreddit_id": "t5_2sh9s"}, {"author": "jednaowca", "body": "Tylko nie Frank Drebin polskiej dyplomacji :( B\u0119d\u0119 t\u0119skni\u0107.", "created_utc": "1515436056.0", "edited": "False", "id": "dsdk33h", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_7oz75o", "parent_id": "t1_dsd9wrx", "score": "5", "subreddit": "Polska", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qiqo"}, {"author": "jednaowca", "body": "Kto\u015b jeszcze pisze precle w 2018?
