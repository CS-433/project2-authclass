Do not ignore them, just recognize their existence, listen and repeat, and they will come to you as long as you do not bemoan them. Yes it's part of \"correct pronunciation\" but once they seep until your mentality your Chinese pronunciation ability will far surpass that of your Japanese or Spanish, even at a far lower level. So much to the point that intermediate Chinese language learners don't even have to focus on pronunciation at all, as a highly advanced Spanish learner would.

And then you are going to have that pesky foreign accent that will take you a lifetime to chip away at. The awesome thing with Chinese is that, as long as you have your tones down, you can be easily mistaken for a native speaker over the phone. This is because China has so many local regions and dialects each with their associated accents that you will just be mistaken for someone from another region of China. And because there are so few syllables there is no hidden phonetic nuances for your accent to come out of. I'd be happy to help you look into Chinese again if you want. I have so much passion for the language I want to share it with whoever is willing.

If you begin by knocking out the first couple thousand characters at once (which sounds kinda crazy but it's only hard for the first couple hundred and then you develop an intimate sense of the inner logic of the characters and they become very easy to learn in bulk) then you are able to understand the inherent logic of word building and guess the meaning of every word in the dictionary. This makes learning Chinese from context, as by reading a book, far easier than any other language. Everything is made up of a small finite set of blocks that all hold inherent meaning and can be combined in predictable ways. It feels kinda like alchemy, which makes sense considering the ancient roots of Chinese writing in alchemy and divination. Compare this to memorizing tens of thousands of random sounds and irregular syllables as in a European language that then have to be conjugated with various weird rules and exceptions applying. The tones can be learned simultaneously with the characters and in pairs when learning compound words. No extra emphasis has to be placed on them, you can pick it up naturally with no extra effort. Yes, these things would make Chinese extra difficult if approached the same way as a European language, but if one's method for learning keeps the unique logical beautiful of Chinese in mind, it is an incredibly simple and straightforward process compared to any other language, with all sorts of tools and memory aids to result in faster acquisition. Chinese is great because nothing is random. \n\nOh, and another thing about the tones: Mandarin is probably the simplest tonal system to learn. This is because it has no registers (where absolute pitch high vs low matters) like Thai or Canto, but only tone contours which are just basic rising m\u00e1, falling m\u00e0, falling and then rising m\u01ce, or flat m\u0101. These come way more naturally then you would expect, it just seems overly daunting to outsiders. Definitely not a reason to be put off from Chinese! If anything, tones are only a benefit to you, because now you only have to know to pronounce the very small chart of basic syllables, none of which contain any consonant clusters whatsoever!

In my experience the first 200 or so were absolutely painful and took *forever* to get into my brain. But after that you will start to understand the logic of the formation of the characters and it will start to get really easy. Look up each new character's etymology each time and make sure that you really understand why the character looks the way it does (I just do a quick check on YellowBridge). After awhile you will start to pick up characters extremely fast because you recognise all the components. I can add 30-50 to my Anki deck a day at this point. For example, look at the character \u64e6. It's pronounced ca1 and means to wipe. It has 17 strokes. If you had no experience with Chinese and I asked you to memorise this character it would be nearly impossible. There would be no way for you to code these 17 seemingly random lines into your memory. It would forever, and you would still be liable to forget. In my case, however, it took less than 5 seconds to program this character into my long-term memory. This is because I am extremely familiar with the hand radical \u624c, which only makes sense in the word for \"wipe\", and I had already learned the phonetic component \u5bdf because it's in the word for police \u8b66\u5bdf. I only had to take one glance at the new character to know it. So you only have to struggle through the first few characters before you become familiar with all the radicals and phonetic components and you'll start picking up characters at an unbelievably rapid pace. Just hold out till then!\n\nOh, and while I'm here, what is your study method? The traditional method of just writing out lines of a character over and over is the most inefficient way imaginable. Don't torture yourself needlessly if that's what you are doing. You need an SRS (spaced repetition software). Download Anki free on your computer immediately if you haven't already.

SRS is the only way to go. Here are the decks you should have: \n\n1. HSK training- you can download each level deck premade from the Anki website. \n2. Hanzi- find a website that lists all the characters in order by frequency. Add 10-20 from this list to your deck at a time. Make each card manually and look up each character on Yellowbridge to see its etymology. You should seek to understand why each character is the way it is. This will seem extremely difficult for the first 100-200 or so but after that you will start learning them quicker and quicker as you begin to understand the logic behind their formation. You will also learn the radicals in the process of doing this if you haven't learned them all ahead of time. Do this with a notebook next to you and write out each flashcard  answer. I've filled whole notebooks of random characters this way.\n3. Spoonfed Chinese- the most amazing Chinese resource I have ever stumbled upon. The free deck on Anki contains over 10,000 sentences with really good audio. The premise of the deck is that it starts with the most basic \"\u4f60\u597d\" and then slowly, bit by bit, adds in one new word at a time. Each new sentence contains only one *or less* new words. If you complete the entire deck you will have learned all the HSK words and grammar points plus a lot more. This is a fantastic way to enhance both your listening and grammar skills as well as vocab. Plus it seems to follow the HSK words for the most part so this deck will be in sync with your HSK training deck. \n4.  Chinese Grammar Wiki-  AllSet Learning's Chinese Grammar Wiki ([https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/](https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/)) is a bible for Chinese learners. But did you know there's a shared Anki deck containing every example sentence from it? Use it to learn all grammar points. \n5. Miscellaneous- Make a place to throw all the random words you've encountered that you want to remember. I have a couple different decks under this for specific books, articles, and songs that I generated with the Chinese Text Analyser. \n\nThere are some resources besides this that you need to have. Firstly, you should download Pleco immediately, if you haven't already. A good dictionary is a must and this is widely regarded to be the best. Next, buy the Chinese Text Analyser. It's only 10 dollars and will be the most useful tool to you when you start to read actual material. It's free for 14 days if you want to check it out. \n\nAs for Duolingo and HelloChinese. . . I would just work through one of them, I prefer HelloChinese. This is a good way to spend dead time (waiting in lines, just before bed, etc) but don't put your serious study hours into this. Another really great vocab learning app is Drops. It's a nice way to learn all those random nouns (like \u5976\u916a\u5228\u4e1d\u742a (cheese grater) or \u4ed9\u4eba\u638c(cactus)) that aren't gonna show up in any course. \n\nI used to listen to Henry Raymond Jr's Learn Chinese on Spotify while I was driving until I mastered all the lessons. Now I just play Taiwan Indie Rock. Just make sure you are listening to Chinese every time you drive, go to the gym, etc. Replace as much of your music as you are willing with Chinese music. Study the lyrics and then listen to the song on repeat until you can sing every line. There's no expressing just how useful song lyrics are to recalling vocab when you need a word that's in one of your favourite songs. \n\nLastly, talk to Chinese people! I meet people on the site Interpals. People there are typically really eager to help you. Plus it's free. I also like to talk to people in Chinese restaurants, but it took a while to build up enough confidence in my ability to do that. \n\nSo, this my methodology. It might not be perfect, but I've managed to go from an HSK 2 to 5 in only 6 months since adopting these techniques. If anyone can let me know of anything else I should be doing it would be greatly appreciated.
