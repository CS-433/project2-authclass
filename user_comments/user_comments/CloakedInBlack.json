[Fluyo](https://www.fluyoapp.com) is planned to be free (either free trial or free by default with potential to upgrade to premium - similar to duo). We are also currently looking for alpha testers (for German, Spanish and French) to help call out bugs & errors that aren\u2019t caught by our engineers/language experts. You can sign up at bottom of website for alpha testing [www.fluyoapp.com](https://www.fluyoapp.com)\n\n**More about the app (long)**\n\nFluyo was originally created out of a need to make Anki better. I personally loved Anki but the outdated UI, avalanche of cards to return to after eventually getting demotivated from using it and the poor UX (without adding a bunch of addons) left much to be desired. So initially we set out to make a much better version of Anki. Anki 2022 if you will. The goal was to make it appealing to your everyday person from a looks and UX standpoint, to have it be as effective as Anki (we use the same supermemo2 algorithm), and to incorporate some much needed features natively on mobile.\n\nI.e. When you add a new word it instantly populates with example sentences to choose from, and can even color the background of the card depending on word gender or type. Other features we\u2019ve built are an ability to easily share your deck with others and to review your deck in various modes (quiz, fill in the blank and even a listening mode).We also included Anki-importing and a daily reward feature so every time you hit your daily review goal (10-200 cards a day) you are rewarded accordingly with in-game currency, achievements and even items. There are a handful of other features regarding our flashcards as well that aren\u2019t public yet.\n\nBut somewhere along the way of creating flashcards we realized it would be nice to have a way to learn vocabulary outside the bounds of SRS. So I invested almost every dollar I made since starting YouTube into hiring a team of 17 to build something we call Journey mode. It\u2019s arguably the best part of Fluyo. It\u2019s essentially the story mode of our game and covers the most common 4,000 words in a language. I won\u2019t go into too many details but think vocab booster (w/ context) meets pokemon meets world of warcraft meets a studio ghibli aesthetic. It\u2019s really something we are proud of. It also plugs into our flashcard system, so every word you learn on your Journey goes directly into your deck(s).\n\nJourney and Flashcards aside, we also developed some kickass mini games that are extremely fun that you can use to practice and learn new vocabulary while competing with friends / people on the internet. The games also link to your flashcard decks so you can review your words via games for the times you get bored of flashcards.\n\nWe also have an array of social features from messaging to group chats, that are chock full of language learning specific features (i.e. tapping on a word in a message and being able to translate it & add to your deck). We match people/groups based on their interests and also use some cool default profile photos similar to Xbox live, so as to avoid the creepiness that occurs on platforms like Tandem/Hellotalk.\n\nI know some are hesitant regarding gamification of language learning. However, I believe gamification done right can really help out millions of people. I remember back to my time playing MMOs for 10+ hours a day and always thought that if language learning could be as addicting as a good video game then people could effortlessly spend hours a day doing it. Most on this subreddit CAN spend hours a day learning although even for us I certainly wouldn\u2019t call doing so effortless as eventually motivation does wane. However the vast majority of people CAN\u2019T, I hope this app can be a way for the average person to do so too.\n\nI\u2019m going to stop writing now as I\u2019m getting a headache (curse this illness some days it\u2019s really hard ;/). Will be around to answer questions for as long as my head lets me!\n\nAlso if you are interested in alpha testing a certain language, [there\u2019s a form on the bottom of our site](https://www.fluyoapp.com)", "created_utc": "1661197377.0", "edited": "1661295093.0", "id": "ild2frr", "is_submitter": "True", "link_id": "t3_wv304j", "parent_id": "t3_wv304j", "score": "218", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "CloakedInBlack", "body": "My fiancee and I couldnt stop watching.

The need to memorize a bunch of characters even prior to knowing what the meaning of said characters will form to create.\n\nIdeal language learning structure doesn't need to be too complicated. Nor should it only revolve around Anki. Though SRS will play a big part.\n\nThe structure will shift depending on focus.Ex. Speaking vs. Writing vs. Reading\n\nBelow is the ideal structure (though not the most beginner-friendly) for those who are Speaking / Comprehension focused:\n\n1. Consume media (tv, youtube, music) from day one. It certainly should not be the last step.\n2. (Optional step, break down the core sounds of a language via listening practice, and or using a program like Pimsleur. Good pronunciation from the beginning goes a long way.\n3. Use Anki / SRS + mnemonics to memorize the top 500-1000 most frequently used words. Ideally sourced from speech/subtitles and not literature/academia (bonus points if filler words are included). Will likely take a month.\n4. Spend a week or two breaking down how basic grammar works and formulating sentences.\n5. Once you have the core words down, have weekly lessons with an online tutor via italki or another similar platform. (The number of lessons per week will vary depending on the amount of time/money you have available).\n6. Allocate a part of your lessons to go over your Anki words with your tutor. Play a game where you try to combine several previously learned words from your deck in order to create new sentences.\n7. Any new words you learn during lessons, add them to your Anki deck w/ the sentence you learned the word in.\n8. While you're not having lessons, add words you learn from media/books and or mass add the next most frequently used 2000 words.\n9. When you have built a deck of 3,000 common words + 500 words from your lessons/life that aren't specifically common but are useful to you (could revolve around personal interests or life situation). Focus all of your effort on speaking with natives (tutor/friends/etc.) and slowly adding new words to Anki + Maintainance.\n10. Most grammar you'll learn from your tutor or intuitively however if you still have large gaps in your knowledge, create a separate deck to practice grammar rules until you've incorporated most into your normal way of speaking.\n\nIf you did that for a year, your listening comprehension, rate of speech, confidence speaking, and active vocabulary would all be off the chart. A bit costly with all of the lessons but it's the approach I wish I followed with my first language.Again ideal for speaking/listening. Reading is a different ballgame as the active production of language isn't important.\n\nIn terms of leaving SRS behind. That's a hard call but feasible if you are getting regular practice in your life and already have an active vocab of \\~3500+ words. You're already past the point where you'd ever forget the language. Though without constant practice your active vocab will gradually diminish.

Therefore you're able to fill in the blanks much easier.\n\nGerman is a more time intensive language than French according to the FSI. It certainly took longer for languages like Russian for me. That could be one reason. Aside from that I don't know what to tell you. I could understand most of the shows / interviews I was watching after the initial the first 5 months with french let alone the sixth. Not to mention it took me around 5 months to get to that point with Dutch too. To be fair I watch a lot of TV. However, I'm not sure how one person can determine what's misleading. It's a fact. It happened to me, there not much else to say. Perhaps we have different standards of competency.

I frequently see \"learn a language quick\" ads and other questionable people advertising how to get instant language success. It definitely is annoying. As for the why, it's because everyone wants everything as fast as possible.\n\nIn my case however, answering your second question. The book is 80 pages, it covers not just techniques but my story, travels, favorite resources. It covers what to expect mentally, it dispels common myths, and generally keeps people motivated while breaking down this seemingly difficult challenge into something that most people with a desire to learn will understand.\n\nThe aim is to lead people to B1 or conversational fluency level in 6-12 months depending on the innate challenge of the language. Which is certainly reasonable and doable with the correct know-how. It's not learning XYZ in 2 weeks nor 3 months.\n\nI really dislike when people have disdain for the multiple B1 approach. B1 is the level where you can either chose to progress further or choose to move to another language without having to fear that you'll forget everything you learned (which can be the case with A1/A2).

You won't understand most of it in the beginning. However, as you begin to learn more of the language you'll start picking up more and more words. Eventually reaching the level after several months where you won't need subtitles for adult level tv shows, which is an amazing feeling. \n\nPerhaps you could learn more with a kid show, but it all comes down to genuine interest for me. If I wouldn't watch it in english, won't watch it in French or Mandarin etc. ", "created_utc": "1508563896.0", "edited": "False", "id": "doo6cqg", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_77eae7", "parent_id": "t1_dom3rim", "score": "1", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "CloakedInBlack", "body": "100% I start with TV at the same time as I start Pimsleur.

I'm 19.\n\n**My routine:**\n\nSo this is a pretty big mess as I never stuck with anyone structured program or routine for a long time. Instead of beginning with Starting Strength like a normal person, I actually just looked up Bodybuilding Split routines from my favorite bodybuilders. \n\nI would often go to the gym 3 or 4 times a week, meaning whatever part of the 5/6 day split I didn't get to I'd get to it the following week. \n\nSome examples:\n\n[Lazar Angelov](http://www.cutandjacked.com/Workout-Routine-Lazar-Angelov) \n\n[Ulysses](http://www.simplyshredded.com/ulisses-jr.html)\n\nMe following routines from popular current fitness models/bodybuilders lasted roughly a year. Then I went old school and started following Arnold\u2019s routine. \n\nEventually, after around 1.5 years of going to the gym, I shifted away from set routines entirely. I started to improvise when I went to workout, and thought of the exercises to do as they came to me. Sometimes I\u2019ll hop on instagram and check out fitness accounts if I want to try a new exercise. \n\n**Diet:** \n\nFor the first few months, I didn\u2019t really eat properly (by bodybuilding standards), just whatever my parents made. I ended up taking a gap year after high school and moved to NYC for an internship, so the quality of my food improved. I started to cook a bit more (teriyaki chicken w/ mash potatoes almost every day lunch and dinner). Finally when I moved back home (internship ended) I really started to eat better. I cooked daily (buffalo popcorn chicken, meatloaf, sriracha meatsauce, turkey tacos, etc.) and always hit my macros, courtesy of theproteinchef on YouTube, brodin bless him. \n\nWhen I went to college my diet fell through. I ate a lot of frozen pizza and in general a lot less hence why my weight went from 175 to 150ish within nine months. Luckily since I was going to the gym often, eating less made me get extremely cut as I could see veins on my abs for the first time ever. The downside was that I lost strength and size. \n", "created_utc": "1470929035.0", "edited": "1477419804.0", "id": "d6dbhp0", "is_submitter": "True", "link_id": "t3_4x8j5p", "parent_id": "t3_4x8j5p", "score": "17", "subreddit": "Brogress", "subreddit_id": "t5_2ys92"}, {"author": "CloakedInBlack", "body": "Perfect.
