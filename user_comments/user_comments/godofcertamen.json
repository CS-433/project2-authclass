Table II is a list of the persons who came with Carvajal from the province of P\u00e1nuco close to Tampico.

Many of them were among the first settlers in Saltillo, coming by way of the mining towns of Zacatecas and Mazapil. Concerning this list, del Hoyo writes: \u201cThis last list gives us a total of 187 persons, of which we believe 130 are of Portuguese origin, which gives us a percentage of 74.8% of Sephardim. Combining these figures with those we obtained on studying the people who came by way of Huasteca, we have a total of 259 people, of which we believe 177 are of Jewish-Portuguese descent, giving us a percentage of 68.3 %.\u201d (Del Hoyo 1979, 268)\".\n\nSeems like it would be easy to misattribute the DNA.

The Garzas and many settlers they brought to northern Mexico certainly were Cyrpto-Jews and practicing in secret to avoid dire consequences. Their leader, Luis Carvajal, was taken from northern Mexico and imprisoned; his family was burned at the stake for practicing the Jewish faith in Nuevo Leon. It's hard to say, but probably a few hundred years since I had a actively practicing Jewish ancestor. They eventually assimilated into Catholicism.

It's very rare to find a record stating a tribe as the priests didn't write it most of the time, but that's where some historical research comes in. Apps like NativeLand.Ca are pretty accurate and researching the villages your native ancestors are from will let you know that it's highly likely you're from X tribe. Since you're from San Luis, it's pretty likely you're Guachichil as well. A lot of my ancestors were from Mexquitic de Carmona, Armadillo de Los Infantes, Salinas de Hidalgo, etc. One other thing that makes it likely that a native ancestor you find is Guachichil in these territories is because if they were Tlaxcalteca - that was a privileged class of natives - the priests were more apt to write that down rather than just say \"Indio\".

It's way past time we stop letting this rose-tinted view of the Spaniards stand. It's not based in reality - they were racist bastards that enslaved indigenous peoples, forcibly assimilated them, robbed them of their riches and kept them in poverty, and perpetuated this system where people loathe their indigenous side. Where everyone says they're mestizo because for the past few centuries being \"pure\" native meant to be pure trash. \n\nNative Americans are all one race. Mixed or not mixed. Personally, I say fuck the European Spanish side. Natives aren't the same culturally speaking, but they are racially.

That would be nonsense. But racially you are native and can absolutely claim it as a race. Mestizo has a racist origin in a system meant to sow division for the benefit of white supremacists. They put that system in place. Mestizos are victims of forced assimilation and manipulation to hate themselves and cling to whiteness as a means to climb the social ladder. They are guilty of oppression, but the sole blame doesn't rest on them.\n\nIgnoring this solidifies the dominance of the Spanish and colonization.

He said the following:\n\n\"More significantly, to be a mestizo is to cop-out. It is to accept the Spaniard\u2019s colonialist-racist ideology. It is to fall supine before the European\u2019s racial grading system instead of struggling for psychological liberation.

That the infusion of whiteness was needed because any of the other races were not worthy enough on their own; natives and blacks needed to be redeemed.

The caste system died almost 200 years ago, but it's insidious effects still linger on everything. People are ashamed of what they are, or if they grew up here as immigrants like me - we're so brainwashed by Latino and Hispanic labels, we don't even know what race we are. We say white. There's always this sad desire to be white. And it's messed up. The Mexican government still purports the mestizo label, still enables division, and is extremely corrupt and untrustworthy too. I'm not saying \"mestizos\" are innocent, but they have been manipulated, subjected to the greatest con of the millenia at the hands of the Spanish. \n\nOne of the first steps in undoing all this madness, in fixing anything is to eliminate this \"we're superior or different because of white blood\" attitude and to show people that they should be proud of their native roots. No, we are most certainly not the same as those who retain their tribal identity, but we are basically the same racially speaking.

He says it means half-breed. Google Translate also says that as well. But yes, I do agree that most people would say it means mixed, and your sources are legit. I just don't like the word because of its origins. I wish I knew how to speak Portuguese, by the way. I watched a show from you guys called 3% on Netflix. Very awesome show, and I love the actress Bianca Comparato lol. \n\nI can definitely understand how it may appear weird. I'm sure it is because those racially mixed are the majority in most of the South American countries. It sounds way better in that respect. If only things were as streamlined in the United States. Unfortunately, they aren't. I've been subjected to insults for being brown from a very early age growing up. Always stared at like I'm a foreigner, and when I realize I'm really not due to being American Indian (my ancestors originated up north in the continental United States and migrated south), this makes that bitterness even larger. \n\nFor example, I've seen pretty racist white people admire American Indian culture (not the actual people) and they love to brag they have a Cherokee great-great grandmother. But they will treat actual natives like crap. And they will treat me like crap too; I look native, got significantly tan skin (the photo on my profile looks lighter due to the lighting). This is because of my American Indian genes. That racism is from not looking white; the Iberian in me there is completely irrelevant to the racists. To me, I just don't see the point in trying to cling onto that and argue \"Oh but I'm not different from you! I'm part white!\" I've been treated very differently by these people, and I am very different. With respect, I could never be a white person or be accepted as one. That's why I don't care for the mix. It's a subjective experience. \n\nDisease killed many natives, but the contributing factors to that is war which causes poverty and death which leads to being susceptible to disease. It's a cycle. Though the Iberians were certainly not as genocidal as the colonists in the continental United States. I recognize that. The colonists up here were very brutal and didn't mix due to their version of white supremacy. \n\nOur culture is certainly a blend, but at least in Mexico, a lot of the culture is very indigenous - the food, the family unit, the art, the history, the language which incorporates Nahuatl words into Spanish, the holidays. I think the indigenous outweighs the Iberian if only a an edge. \n\nHonestly, yes, choosing the American Indian side is denying the European side and how we came to be. But it can also be argued as something positive. An attempt of trying to restore what colonialism destroyed - trying to reconnect, trying to de-colonize. To not say it is all lost and the Spaniards won. I mean, our countries became independent from these powers - it's not like we have a great love for them. \n\nAt the end of the day, I think it's just a very personal choice. What the Professor says is a dream. It would likely be somewhat successful with the Hispanic populations in the United States as an identity shift. Everywhere else? I'm not holding my breath.

Translators say it means half-breed. But we can disagree on the interpretation. To answer your question, it's denying your own people's history because people tend to use this \"mestizo\" term to very strongly affirm white descent and separate themselves from being native due to historically thinking it's inferior. Here in the United States, most Hispanics say their race is white (26 million did in the last census out of 27 million Hispanic respondents). Even people surveyed by Pew Research that identified as mestizo will say they're white rather than saying they're mixed race. \n\nI go into the identity issue and census in one article, but for the mestizo issue, I break this down with scholarly sources in my article \"The Racist Origin of Mixed Race in Central and South America\" which I linked. This professor, Jack Forbes, also breaks it down in his essay \"The Mestizo Concept\". It all comes back to the ugly origins of the word which is from the caste system, a racial grading system the Spaniards used. And the manner in which they used it was pretty racist.\n\nIf you read my essay and his you may understand our viewpoints, but chances are you're not likely going to. I think that's because we are a product of two very different places. I'm realizing this as more time passes here on Reddit. Many Hispanics tend to agree with this viewpoint only if they were raised/lived (for a long time) in the United States. Because as you say, it is very racially polarized and segregated. Here in the U.S., being mixed grants you no favors in a very racist climate. You'd choose to be in your own camp rather than a whole racial group that's more unified and able to organize, pass legislation, etc. Here, being part white and affirming that white descent is silly as people don't see it - they see your brown skin and that's all that matters. It especially doesn't matter how brown you are in the South or Midwest. So why accept or identify as something I'd never be (white)? Then again, most Hispanics try to do that for a multitude a reasons, one of them being the education system here really makes you forget you're another race and the ethnic labels don't help matters either. Another is a desire to just identify as white and try to assimilate. \n\nAnother thing is I don't see why accepting and liking heritage rooted in racism, genocide, and subjugation of one side of my ancestors is a positive thing. The Spanish crown and conquistadores weren't very good people. Chances are, hypoethically, if you could time travel to those conquistador ancestors, they'd think you're a savage indio despite being mixed. I'm not telling you your viewpoint is wrong - I just simply want to explain why I don't align with it. I respect your differing opinion and choice to identify as mestizo. That's your freedom.

On average black people have 24% European DNA, right? Okay so, mixed black people - those that are light skinned, you know with a white parent and a black one - are half and half. Yet they identify as black for their race. You aren't going to tell them they aren't black are you? Or that black people that aren't mixed are going to laugh at them? Same situation buddy. You're a hypocrite. That's all I'm saying. \n\nAnd let's not forget, registered tribes in the U.S. have low blood requirements. Some have as low as a 7% native blood requirement to be registered. Their race is considered American Indian by the government, the census, etc. They aren't called mixed or mestizo. So according to your logic, are they all not natives?

That attitude stems from the Spanish colonial caste system and racist works like The Cosmic Race which affects not only Mexican society but many other Central and South American countries. That is why there is this...drive or desire to be white.\n\nYou see, in the beginning the Spanish wed with the natives due to a lack of Spanish women. The Spaniard father faced a choice regarding the fate of his mixed child. If he accepted the child as legitimate, he/she would be considered white and join the elite to help govern.  More whites were needed as there was a shortage after all. If the Spaniard rejected the child, he/she would be considered native and sent to live in an indigenous community like any full-blood. Either way, the mix was irrelevant in the beginning. \n\nThis became an issue when these mixed children that joined the elite started to rebel against the colonial government. Due to this, the Spanish created the mestizo term which became synonymous with illegitimate. With an influx of black slaves, they also feared the mestizos, natives, and blacks rebelling together and unifying, so they created the caste system. Being mestizo was seen as superior to being fully blooded black or native, so it sowed division. \n\nOver time, people clamored to try and be mestizo. Many full bloods faked it if they could because it granted special privileges above being a full blooded non-white. The closer the proximity to whiteness, the better. This is where that desire to be whiter comes in. In the early 1900s, Jose Vasconcelos released his work \"La Raza Cosmica\" which extolled being mixed as better because it would lead to a grand new race better than all before it. While it may sound positive in terms of being mixed, this work was anti-native and basically stated that the colored races on their own couldn't be noteworthy but needed mixing - needed that element of whiteness to advance. Date whiter, date lighter became the thing to do and was told to children.\n\nThis is one reason why I won't embrace \"mestizo\". I will embrace myself as native. I'm like 50-55% depending on the DNA test. But being mixed was never a concept until the Spanish made it so and the whole desire to be whiter is societal manipulation.\n\nThat's my two cents and from reading Before Mestizaje by Ben Vinson III and currently reading La Raza Cosmica.", "created_utc": "1602102908.0", "edited": "False", "id": "g81g03j", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_j6u8wa", "parent_id": "t1_g80pjz5", "score": "11", "subreddit": "AncestryDNA", "subreddit_id": "t5_3lh3c"}, {"author": "godofcertamen", "body": "Yes for sure!

I have joined a community called Mexica Tribe for those of us that are tribeless. There are 13,000 members.\n\nBeing mixed is no problem. The problem is when people like you want to keep us in this limbo where we can't identify with anything. People like you prevent us from uniting as a people, to undo colonialism. And yes, our race is overlooked ALL the time. Ask a guy in the U.S. what my race is and he is going to say Latino or Hispanic. Those aren't races and neither is mixed or mestizo. \n\nAnd yes, thank God I don't need the approval of some white person telling me what I am. I actually do have the approval of many other natives. The Mexica Tribe accepts me on Facebook. r/IndianCountry and r/NativeAmerican accept me.

These tribe members are not called mixed or \"mestizo\". They are called American Indians, even if they are majority white. So get out of here with your double standards.\n\nOur racial identity as Native Americans has been overlooked and extirpated due to colonialism. The very concept of mixed race is a byproduct of the Spanish caste system they created to sow division and keep themselves in power.
