The idea of a galaxy-spanning chase that lasts tens of thousands of years was just fascinating to me. When you were writing it, did you ever consider turning it into a novel rather than a short story? I know it came out before your debut novel, but I always thought that the sheer scale of the ideas in Galactic North could've lent itself well to a longer story. The legend of Irravel and Markarian deserves to be told in full!\n\n2. Was the Muskie outpost in Inhibitor Phase a knock on Elon Musk's Mars colonization plans? What are your views on the colonization of Mars in general? I know some people believe it's too early and that we should focus on the Moon or orbital habitats first.\n\n3. Your short stories have inspired me to try writing a sci-fi short of my own, so I've been working on that lately.

It was a pretty old account and had a lot of stuff so it sucked to lose it, but at least I'm no longer ridiculously easy to dox.\n\nI also made the mistake of having tons of different accounts that all had that same old username, so lately I went through the long, tedious process of changing the usernames, or in cases where I couldn't, deleting the accounts and making new ones. Now I'm using different usernames for almost all of them", "created_utc": "1659580041.0", "edited": "False", "id": "iiv5srr", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_wf58gd", "parent_id": "t1_iiusg6i", "score": "2", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i"}, {"author": "Irravel", "body": "I also ended up overbaking these a tad.
