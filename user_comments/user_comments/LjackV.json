In hot pursuit, it seems that the world champion decided to take this step not for health reasons. A cryptic explanation on Twitter with a quote from Mourinho: \u201cIf I speak I am in big trouble. I don't want to be in big trouble\u201d hints, but does not claim. The Grand Prix cycle of the late noughties comes to mind, when FIDE changed the rules of the series along the way, in response to which the young Norwegian, then not even No. 1 of the rating list, along with Michael Adams dropped out of the draw. The normal reaction of representatives of the civilized world who are not accustomed to fraud. It seems that this time everything is different.  \nIn between, I'll repent myself. In 2011, 2 rounds before the end, he was eliminated from the round-robin tournament in Saratov. I still regret it. It was not good, and even very bad, but the relief is temporary, and cowardice is forever. Nonsense for an outsider; classical chess is so devoid of meaning in its essence that if traditions, unwritten laws, in a word, the spirit of the game, go away, something completely different will remain. They say: \u201dA valid reason for the actor's absence from the performance is death.\u201d I want to believe in such meanings in chess.  \nIn the third, the last round for himself, Carlsen lost white to Hans Niemann. The trajectory of the young American is fascinating. Having entered the pandemic in March 2020 with a mediocre 2,459 for 17 years, a year later he added 50 points. Not God knows what! However, then the miracles began. Since April 2021, Niemann's rating has been growing non-stop for a year and a half. The crescendo (or just an episode, who knows) in the form of a victory over the world champion turned out to be overshadowed by suspicions of foul play. Backed up by a demonstrative gesture unprecedented for an emotionally stable Magnus.  \nIt should be emphasized that any other grandmaster in the place of the world champion in the event of such a demarche would risk disproportionately more. Any tournament without him loses more than he does. Perhaps the situation with the match does not give Carlsen peace of mind. Witticisms on the Internet will not cancel the truth \u2013 having evaded the fight, you do not leave, but only run away (sorry) undefeated. It remains only to regret that the fear of possible defeat (this can never be!), the temptation of all the geniuses of the game, turned out to be too much for the Norwegian.  \nThere are no serious anti-cheating measures that give players a sense of complete security in chess. Along with the frames, metal detectors, broadcast delay, there is also confidence in their \u201ccircumvention\u201d. Chess is a gentleman's game, and in general, a very geeky activity \u201cfor their own\u201d. Grandmasters devote their lives to 64 cells not for the sake of fame or earnings as such. It is rather a sect with a system of abstract values, in which the ascent through the internal hierarchy is more important than the material. But \u201cvanity is my favorite of sins,\u201d as the devil Al Pacino used to say. For the sake of this ecstasy, they cheat in \u201cWhat? Where? When?\u201d, although it would seem.  \nAt the same time, comparisons of computer prompts with doping in sports are inappropriate. The advice of the \u201cengine\u201d gives a guarantee, but does not increase the chances. They do not undermine the athlete's health, unlike various medications. It is naive to analyze the \u201cpercentage of hits\u201d \u2013 a few moments during the game are enough for a craftsman, and at times a conscious suboptimal game is possible. To those who rushed to study Niemann's work, I will reveal a secret \u2013 cheating can be different. On a tip, you can't play on the second or third line either! Even once.  \nUnfortunately, now, in the end, all such cases come down to \u201cI believe - I don't believe\u201d, which is clear even from Carlsen's silence. Neither guilt nor complete innocence can be proved.\"", "created_utc": "1662494152.0", "edited": "False", "id": "incufma", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_x7k2vk", "parent_id": "t3_x7k2vk", "score": "13", "subreddit": "chess", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhr7"}, {"author": "LjackV", "body": "He wrote a novel, the main things I got from it is he's dissapointed by Magnus' decision to withdraw.
