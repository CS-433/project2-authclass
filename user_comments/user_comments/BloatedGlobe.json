I went into how I would focus more on his ethnicity. I said, 'Look, by the way, Egypt is in Africa. You gotta stop drawing him like a white guy. You gotta stop treating him like a white guy.' There's all this unexplored country within the character's makeup, and DC's never gone there. They've never said, 'OK. This is a guy from the Middle East who lives part-time in America, where he would be subject to a certain level of scrutiny and bigotry.' There would be these political forces around Kahndaq that are pressing on him externally: He's right next door to Jordan and Israel's not that far away, and then the real Egypt is to the west of them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Then you have internal forces. You have a growing democracy movement. Black Adam's trying to be very progressive. Kahndaq the city is full of all these ancient monuments, but we're also seeing all of these construction cranes dotting the landscape because he's trying to transform it into something more like Wakanda. So he's modernizing and up are going these amazing glass towers, and things like that. The people of Kahndaq are split over that. Some people like that: 'Yes, we'd like a secular government. We like you progressive.' But some want Sharia Law and they want traditionalism. So there's this tension going on there. He can't support a democracy movement, not because he doesn't want his people to be free, but because American-style democracy is a very difficult thing to attain and a very difficult thing to maintain, as we are seeing in our own country. Ironically, I agree with Black Adam, where Black Adam is against democracy in Kahndaq. I think he's right.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHe wants to tell a very political story about Middle Eastern politics that he thinks is both really interesting and also thought would be a bit too edgy for DC Comics. There is a dynamic in a lot of Greater Middle Eastern countries where a more socially progressive dictator is at odds with democratic movements that are very socially conservative/ Islamists. In part because these Islamist movements have provided a social security net that the \"progressive\" dictators ignore. So democratization movements are a bit of a coin flip. Kahndaq could become Tunisia, but it also could become Egypt after the Arab spring.\n\nIt's definitely an interesting story to tell, albeit one that needs to be told with a lot of caution.

I'm blonde, and I was in a less touristy city, so I did face a lot of harassment.  That said, that half year was one of the best times of my life and I highly recommend visiting! In general, I was pretty safe.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere's some advice.\n\n1. Dress modestly. You may notice that some tourists don't, but it will make a huge difference in how you're treated. \n2. Walk on busy roads. Crowds offer safety. Also, Moroccans are absolutely awesome and will intervene if they think someone is a threat to another person. \n3. You will still probably be catcalled and maybe followed. If you are followed, go into a store or something and talk to the shopkeeper. Most of the time, you are not in danger, but Moroccan men and women are segregated pretty early on in school, so unfortunately Moroccan guys don't always get how scary it is to be harassed. That doesn't mean that their catcalling=threat.\n4. Learn phrases in Darija. Language can be a touchy subject. Unless you're interacting with rich Moroccans, people are usually thrilled to hear you speak their language instead of French. \n5. Think of it like a game. People get really overwhelmed bargaining at the Medina or annoyed that someone is trying to scam them, but it's a just game.  Getting upset about it makes you the bad sport. A shopkeeper may rip you off majorly and then want to befriend you over tea. Mashi Mushkil.\n6. Smaller cities like Rabat, Chefchaouen, Rabat, Tetchaouen, Essaouira, and Tetouan will feel safer and less overwhelming than bigger cities like Marrakech, Fez, Casa, and Tangier.\n7. Go on a tour!!! The best part of Morocco is by far the people. I've had strangers give me tours of their houses, invite me to tea and conversation, teach me how to dance, regale me with conspiracy theories about bees, give me a ride and offer me nuts, and walk me home when I felt unsafe. Going on a tour is a way to interact with Moroccans and Moroccan culture in a way you probably won't if you go alone.\n\nTLDR: Morocco is a fantastic place, and you 100% should go.", "created_utc": "1652833432.0", "edited": "False", "id": "i90j8cp", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_urni3n", "parent_id": "t3_urni3n", "score": "3", "subreddit": "travel", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh41"}, {"author": "BloatedGlobe", "body": "Less fun than last week.

I'm also partial to the Freer Sackler and the African Art museums because they tend to be quieter Smithsonian's. Dumbarton House in Georgetown is also free and fantastic. Dumbarton Gardens are beautiful, but they do cost money. The Philips is also a nice museum that charges Admission. \n\nThere's four bookstores in DC that I frequent: Lost City in Adams Morgan, Capitol Hill Books in Eastern Market, Second Story and Kramers in Dupont.

Kramers is not a used bookstore and can be expensive, but it has a pretty great selection. I don't like Afterwards (the Cafe in Kramers) though.\n\nDC has a lot of great coffee shops. I second Emissary. Tatte has fantastic pastries. I've always been more of a tea fan, so I have to recommend Teaism (Dupont Location for the vibes) and Ching Ching Cha.

Whether or not, containment is necessary or a cold war mindset, I don't know, but that is the aim, and AUKUS is an effective step in that direction.\n\nIt's a complete win for the UK. It'll probably be BAE systems that builds the submarines and they get to use Australia as a base for their nuclear submarines.

I'm not super familiar with their general geopolitics. It's a pivot away from Asia and back to the anglosphere. Malaysia and Indonesia are pissed, but the Philippines support it. I don't know how other countries are taking it, but Japan and the UK started talks for joint military exercises, so I imagine there's tacit approval there. Nuclear submarines are cool and the US-UK tech is better for Australia's needs than the French tech.  The non-nuclear submarine deal was unpopular, and this can be confirmed by reading old newspapers. I'm not sure that the AUKUS submarines will be produced any faster or cheaper though. I think this is mostly about containment for Australia too.\n\nIt's bad for France. They have a lot of interest in the Southern Pacific and were counting on having Australia as a close partner. The UK has essentially replaced them fast. AUKUS also reinforces the notion that five eye countries will always put each other first. In a lot of ways, the five eyes are more united than the EU.

Also recently, France has been losing a lot of military contracts last minute to the US, so they're pissed and feel like the US is trying to kill their military industrial complex. In this case, probably not, considering that the US was involved and making bank in the France-Australia contract too. France overreacted by recalling ambassadors.  This is probably, in part, due to election pressure, but Macron also used it as an excuse to get US approval for a European army, so in that aspect, it was a successful tactic. I'm personally supportive of a European army, but I think that it will run into a lot of issues in the short-term (Continentalists vs Atlanticists, opposition to European federalization, potential gas crises necessitating closer relations between western European countries with Russia and former soviet countries not trusting western ones because of this).\n\nFinally, bad actors have been taking advantage of the whole situation to create disharmony among Western powers, as always.

Discourse in the English speaking world must seem absurd because the English word \"race\" and the French \"la race\" are false friends, so some people think that the English language is literally calling people different breeds based on their skin color. This also leads to conversations about how \"It's racist to talk about race.\"\n\nBut because of this attitude, Switzerland has, in the past at least, failed to address and acknowledge its institutional and causal racism. There (as far as I know) aren't anti-discrimination laws. People seem educated about institutional racism in the US, but fail to see how it occurs here. Housing discrimination, targeted policing, racist hiring practices etc. My friends get asked racist questions in job interviews in Switzerland that are clear examples of bias (\"We employ women here. As a Muslim, can you work with them?\" Like wtf?).\n\nOne of my friends worked in a lab for a professor that liked to refer to himself as a \"Slavedriver\" and would threaten his students (all African immigrants) with deportation (he could get their visas revoked) if they didn't work illegal hours under intense verbal abuse.

One of my friends is Indian, and whenever he told someone this, the first question people would as is \"Why is there so much rape in India?\" He lived in four different European countries, and he said that Switzerland was the most accepting despite the casual racism.

It just is an adjective that refers to Islam.\n\nIt's important to distinguish because they are different organizations. The Taliban is majority Pashtun and they want to force Islamized Pashtun values on the majority non Pashtun population. They were an incredibly violent government, and people are (rightfully) worried that they will begin to genocide ethnic minorities like the Hazara  again. The majority of Pashtun people live in Pakistan, so they also gotten some sympathy and funding from some people there. They have been sympathetic to Salafi Jihadist groups like Al-Qaeda and offered them refugee, but the Taliban has not really been focused on committing violence outside the borders of Afghanistan. They've only harbored those who do.\n\nI don't know much about ISIL-K. They are (or were)  pretty small group. Just a couple thousand. They're supposed to be the South and Central Asian branch of ISIS, so I guess they have the same philosophy. Also based on Qutb's philosophy (I swear this man is responsible for most of the problems in the greater middle east right now), they are Salafi and Wahabist, not Deobandi. They want a global Caliphate, which means that unlike the Taliban, they have active plans of terrorist attacks outside of their countries. So, it's important to distinguish them, since ISIL-K actively wants to implement their vision worldwide in a bloody fashion.

It's just that the window for what bad is has shifted.\n\nTo be clear, only about 10 million Muslims (this number is dated, it's probably a little more now) out of 1.9 billion believe in these violent interpretations of Islam. They're really unpopular, but 25% of the world is Muslim.\n\nAnd no, not every Muslim country is funding terrorism. They are the main victims of terrorism.

He is also considered one of the biggest influencers on bin Laden.\n\nThe unrest in that part of the world is fairly recent, nowhere near 200 years (at least not compared to other regions like Europe).

Plus, they impacted childhood development, reducing the IQ of some of the population (in the past. Like before 1900. Not people today). But the impact can still be seen today. The North got a head start and continues to be more economically competitive than the south.\n\n I'm not sure whether or not most of Southern Europe faced similar struggles in the past, but a French friend did say that malaria was endemic in the south in the early 1900's before eradication, so maybe diseases in the distant past could have also played a part.", "created_utc": "1625518976.0", "edited": "False", "id": "h4615h4", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_oe3okx", "parent_id": "t1_h45btuj", "score": "2", "subreddit": "MapPorn", "subreddit_id": "t5_2si92"}, {"author": "BloatedGlobe", "body": "Maybe you could look into Post Modern literature and surrealism?", "created_utc": "1625406477.0", "edited": "False", "id": "h40tmz7", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_odj3ca", "parent_id": "t3_odj3ca", "score": "1", "subreddit": "booksuggestions", "subreddit_id": "t5_2ryqe"}, {"author": "BloatedGlobe", "body": "I  dunno.

From your description, you have a lot of experience in different countries around the world, so getting over the cultural differences are probably going to be pretty easy to you. I'll share some advice below, but you may know most of it.\n\n1. If you play any sports, join a recreational sports league. Fastest way to make friends.\n2. Make small talk with the people you work with. It's not always fun, but if you don't, people won't think you like them.\n3. Unless you're doing something like business, don't brag too much. People will like you the most if they've heard of your accomplishments, but they've heard it from someone else but you (we will brag about our friends accomplishments)\n4. American humor is mostly self depreciative. Don't tease people until you feel like close friends. Also, don't make jokes that rely off of stereotypes of race/ ethnicity/ nationality (unless you're making fun of yourself). That's less acceptable in the US than in the EU.\n5. Americans are indirect. Google a few \"[what Americans mean](https://blog.talaera.com/what-americans-mean-english-expressions)\" vs \"[what they say](https://twitter.com/andre_spicer/status/842043280707727361?lang=fr)\" charts. If you want to criticize someone's work, you sandwich the criticism between two complements. If someone wants to hang out with you, they will give a specifics. I.e.\n   1. \"We should hangout sometime.\"---Just a polite phrase.\n   2. \"Do you want to come to my Barbecue on Saturday.\"---Specifies both activity (and the activity is not coffee) and  when the activity would take place. In the same vein, if you ask someone to do something for the first time, and they say \"I can't,\" but don't offer an alternative, they probably don't want to hang out with you ever.\n6. Hierarchies aren't as much of a thing as elsewhere. We don't have the meritocracy based hierarchies of Germany academia or the age based hierarchies of Chinese academia. It's normal to just hang out and joke with your professor. Befriending your professor is the best way to build professional connections, since they have connections to all their former students too.\n7. If you teach classes, you are expected to be very involved with the students performance. If they ask a question outside class, you're expected to answer it.\n8. If you have any problem with your visa, adapting to the US, or anything related to academics, ask the administration. They are expected to be as helpful as possible.\n9. It's completely normal to just email someone to ask if you can meet to talk about their job. If they don't respond, no big deal, but you can be very blatant about your networking.\n10.

People travel to London to see mummies in the British Museum rather than travel to Cairo, and this leads to a loss in tourism and research jobs for the country of origin.\n\nAnother issue is that, while artifacts in the British Museum may be more accessible to Brits and other people from western countries, they are not accessible to people from the country of origin. Due to visas and differing strengths of currency, it is much harder for the average Peruvian to visit a museum in NYC than it would be for the average American to visit a museum in Lima. This deprives people of the ability to know and experience their own history and culture.\n\nI feel like I should clarify some things about repatriation of artifacts. It\u2019s not a fringe or novel ideal. Precendence for repatriation was set a long time ago (see 1970  [UNESCO Convention against Illicit Export](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNESCO_Convention_on_the_Means_of_Prohibiting_and_Preventing_the_Illicit_Import,_Export_and_Transfer_of_Ownership_of_Cultural_Property#Details)), but many museums just ignore it.  \n\nAnother example (US specific because I am American),  in the US,  repatriation of Native American objects has been common since the late 1980\u2019s/ early 1990s with the National Museum of American Indian Act and the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Acts. Essentially, organizations receiving federal funding must return objects that fall into one of five categories: Human remains, Associated Funerary Objects, Unassociated Funerary Objects, Sacred Objects, and Objects of Cultural Patrimony.
