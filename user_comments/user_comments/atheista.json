I started seeing a psychologist because I had developed binge eating disorder due to PTSD.  The PTSD was tackled first, then the focus shifted to the eating disorder.  Despite making general progress in life I could never sustain long term progress with my eating disorder.  For years I'd make progress for a month or so then fuck it all up again.  Two years ago I stumbled upon the ADHD subreddit when researching Vyvanse (BED and ADHD med).  It blew my mind when I related to almost everything posted there.  I approached my psych about it and and she said I didn't present like someone with ADHD but that it would actually explain so much about why I couldn't maintain my progress.  A few months with a psychiatrist and I had a diagnosis and started on meds.  There was a pretty big improvement, but I'd still be fucking everything up every couple of months, just less so than before.  I then discovered the Cyclothymia subreddit and realised that bipolar is a spectrum and you don't need to be psychotically manic or suicidally depressed to have bipolar.   So again I approached my psych and again she said I didn't present like someone with bipolar but that it would explain a lot.  Back to the psychiatrist, got a diagnosis and started on meds.\n\nI finally feel like I have all of the correct dianoses and I've been maintaining progress for about 6 months now.\n\nIt is very frustrating that my psychologist didn't pick up on the ADHD or the bipolar in the *many* years that I had been seeing her.

I stumbled across that sub looking for something unrelated and when I read a few posts I was like \"Wtf?! This sounds like me!\"  I never dreamed that I could have ADHD because I'm a quiet, lazy introvert.  But the more I read the more I knew that I 100% had ADHD.  \n\nSome of the big symptoms for me were...\n\n* Procrastination - procrastinating literally everything, good or bad.  I could be screaming in my head to do something for hours but I'd be physically incapable of making myself do it.  It was only with a last minute panic that I could actually get shit done.\n\n* Messy - if something fell on the floor I would joke to my husband \"oh I'll pick it up next month...\" then three months later it'd still be there (he's just as bad).  There was a 10c coin on my toilet floor for about a year.  Every time I went to the toilet I'd see it and think \"ooh, I have to pick that up!\" but by the time I'd flushed the toilet I'd forgotten about it.\n\n* Brain Jukebox - I *always* have a song stuck in my head.  Or multiple songs.  If I hear a word or phrase that is vaguely reminiscent of a song lyric that song will instantly be stuck in my head. On repeat.  Until the next song.  But it's not just songs, it can be words, random sounds, numbers.  My brain is just so god damn loud!\n\n* Weird hyperfocus obsessions - ever since I was a kid I have been obsessed with designing floor plans for dream houses.  I'll get totally absorbed in it, picturing myself walking through it and designing every detail down to the plant choices in the garden and the tiles in the bathroom.  But it's 100% or nothing.  I'm obsessed with it for days then I don't do it for a year.  \n\n* Reading - 9 times out of 10 when I try to read a book it's like the book is made of teflon and my eyes just slide right off it.  But then all of a sudden I will hyperfocus on reading and do nothing else for days.\n\n* \"So much potential\" - this is so common with people with ADHD.  Particularly inattentive ADHD.  I was a smart kid so I did well without trying, which was great until I reached the point where I had to start trying and didn't know how.  I learnt to blag my way out of bad marks and avoid things I wouldn't be good at, but there's only so long that would work.  \n\n* Great at first impressions - I present well and come across responsible and organised initially (because of the novelty causing me to hyperfocus on new things) but then give it a couple of days, weeks or months and the unorganised, lazy procrastinator manages to disappoint everyone.\n\n* Impulse issues - always craving a dopamine hit because that's what ADHD brains are lacking.  For many that means alcohol, gambling, drugs... for me it is food.\n\nYou'll notice a lot of the things I talked about were past tense and some were present tense.  That's because ADHD meds have really helped with my executive functioning (being able to do stuff when I need to) but not so much with other things (will my brain *ever* shut up?).

Then two years ago I discovered /r/ADHD and had a massive revelation - every post I read was like looking in the mirror.  Every quirk and struggle in my life could be explained by ADHD.  I brought it up with my psych and she said she never would have thought of it because I don't present like someone with ADHD (I am very organised when it comes to appointments and in one on one situations I tend to hyperfocus instead of getting distracted).  There were so many weird things in my life (strange hyperfocus obsessions, the intense and unrelenting sound of 3 songs stuck in my head at the same time...) that I had never thought to mention because I didn't think they were relevant. She never would have known without me figuring it out for myself. I started medication and it made a huge difference.

I'd be going great for a month or two then everything would just go to shit again.  A month or two of progress then another month of fucking it up.  I was becoming more and more aware of the cyclical nature of my problem. I thought maybe I had bipolar, but the usual descriptions on bipolar didn't fit.  I don't get crippling depression, nor do I get grandiose mania. Then I discovered /r/cyclothymia which made me realise that bipolar is a spectrum and you don't need those extremes to be bipolar.  So I brought it up with my psych and again she said she never would have thought of it because I don't present like someone with bipolar, but yeah, it fits.  My psychiatrist agreed and here I am, almost 4 months into Lamotrigine and feeling so much better.\n\n**TL;DR** Your psych only sees a tiny snapshot of your life so it can be very difficult to diagnose certain disorders, especially if you're high functioning and present yourself well despite feeling like you're falling apart in private.

Only catch? We're both self employed musicians with low incomes (at the time it was probably under $60k combined).

They offered to take out a $380k mortgage on their home to lend us the money.  We had lawyers document it all as us being mortgaged to them and the repayment agreement specified that we were responsible for all repayments and related fees and charges for the loan they took out on their property.  We paid every cent so the arrangement didn't cost them any money, but it was still an incredible thing for them to do and we never could have bought at that time or in the location we wanted without that help.\n\nWe found a place for $395k in the perfect location.  A do-er-upper but very solid with room to grow and be our forever home.\n\nFast forward to the start of this year, with increased incomes and a huge amount of equity due to house prices almost doubling in the area, we were able to get our own mortgage with Bank of Melbourne, pay off the in-laws' mortgage, and even borrow a bit extra for a bathroom renovation.\n\nIt feels good that we did it all with our own money despite not having high incomes, but we also know we're eternally indebted to my husband's parents for giving us the opportunity.

It's actually recently been made available on the PBS and in a wider range of doses.  It's dropped from about $120 to $40 a month so it's much more affordable now.\n\nAlso don't disregard psychologists entirely.  A psychiatrist only deals with the chemical side of things (which is a big part of ADHD) but medication isn't a magic pill that will solve 100% of your ADHD problems.

Look on their websites to see if they list adult ADHD as a focus, or try emailing to ask if they have experience working with patients with adult ADHD.\n\nExpect the process to take a long time.  Because of the nature of ADHD meds (usually amphetamines) the diagnosis process is very rigorous.   It can also take months just to get an appointment.  I was lucky to be able to see someone within a month as it was within the same clinic as my psychologist so she pushed to get me in if there were any cancellations.  It was still another 5 months before I was officially diagnosed and prescribed medication, but honestly I think part of that timeframe was down to my psychiatrist being massively over committed and unorganised, so it could be quicker than that.\n\nThe best thing I did was write everything down.  If you're anything like me, you can probably think of a million examples of why you may have ADHD but if you were asked in an appointment to list them you'd be like...\"um.....?\"  I read thousands of posts on /r/ADHD and every time someone's post resonated with me I'd write down an example of that from my own life.  I had pages and pages of things from my childhood to my adult life that I thought could be connected to ADHD.  \n\nIf it turns out that you do have ADHD it's amazing how much of a difference it makes both getting the correct treatment and having an explanation for why you may have struggled with certain things throughout your life.\n\nBest of luck!\n\nEdit to add: There wasn't an official test like I've heard some Americans describe (testing cognitive abilities and such).
