In my experience, older generations will insist that moroccan youth are being wasted being taught French instead of English, and people my age will just naturally gravitate more towards English due to the cultural reach it has, so, while people do speak it, there's some resentment towards it to a certain extent, without even getting into the weeds of social tensions when it comes to France and Moroccan/NA immigrants.\n\nIn January of 2021 I started learning Spanish as a pastime, and everything about the struggles and the interest it got out of me just made me appreciate French even more, and especially in one aspect : looking for comprehensible input in a new language is almost a lesson in lowering made up mental standards and just finding the interesting part of anything you take in, and I almost couldn't really articulate why, but it suddenly made me a lot more open to some stuff like some classic songs or some radio shows (I'm SO grateful for France Culture holy shit) that I was kinda indifferent to because having grown  up around them, they just kinda seemed like part of the cultural furniture, and I never really bothered to give them much of a shot.

I think it bodes pretty well for future Manias.\n\nThe main event was on par with the WM30 one, ever so slightly below the WM20 one, but man I couldn't take my attention off this match if I wanted to.

Triple threats main events of Mania feel so massive for some reason, it makes you connect with each wrestler's first person experience of the match that much more. \n\nBig E v Apollo was the match that surprised me the most, for as short as it was, both looked like stars in the making. Randy v Fiend was a thumbs in the middle match for me, it feels like the Fiend character puts a ceiling on the quality of the matches that Bray can have, I love the persona but it somehow feels like it wasn't cut for the WWE format of wrestling.
