In standard Arabic there are moods which are conveyed via short vowels which are not written, and not used in speech outside of very formal (usually pre written) speeches. So in standard Arabic:\n\n/jaqbiruni:/ OR /jaqburuni:/ in the indicative (just to confuse you, both are valid pronunciations with no difference)\n\n/jaqbirni/ OR /jaqburni/ would be considered a more spoken/casual way of saying it in any case.\n\nWhen you get to narrow transcription, this vary wildly by region. Arabic dialects can diverge quite a bit both in consonant pronounciations and in vowel quality. I only know enough about Palestinian to feel brave enough to transcribe narrowly, which would be something like:\n\n[j\u028a\u0294bo\u027eni] or [j\u026a\u0294birni]\n\nNote that once again vowel qualities vary a lot even within Palestine/Jordan. In addition /q/ is a letter few agree on the pronunciation, so you could easily replace the glottal stop with [q] or [g] even in urban accents", "created_utc": "1653077858.0", "edited": "False", "id": "i9ddtsq", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_uu5d6a", "parent_id": "t3_uu5d6a", "score": "5", "subreddit": "linguistics", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhos"}, {"author": "krwerber", "body": "Because Spanish doesn\u2019t have any consonants with aspiration, it\u2019s common that speakers pronounce them without it.
