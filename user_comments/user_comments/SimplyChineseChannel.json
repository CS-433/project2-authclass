For the two older ones, we\u2019ve tried to send them to Chinese school before (free ones offered by local school board). They didn\u2019t like it and quit after just a term, so we didn\u2019t push it.\n\nHowever as they grow older, they become more and more interested in their heritage culture and language. So, now we signed them up for private Chinese class again, and they are enjoying it so far. Also we\u2019ve been speaking more and more Chinese with them at home. (I admit that we were lazy earlier and didn\u2019t only speak Chinese at home with them.) Some of our friends\u2019 kids speak perfect Chinese at native level because the parents insisted speaking Chinese at home only. \n\nChinese is not their 2nd language, it\u2019s actually their 3rd language. They all went to French Immersion school starting grade 1. All subjects were taught in French from grade 1 to 3. And from grade 4 and up, some subjects would be taught in English, and eventually it\u2019s about 50/50. \n\nMy suggestion is to speak your native language at home with your kids as much as possible. (It\u2019s very easy to be lazy and resort to English like what we did.) Also if it\u2019s financially and physically manageable, bring your kids to visit places/countries where your native language is spoken as often as possible. So they are exposed to the language and culture, and not thinking it\u2019s just a weird language that their parents happen to speak. I wish we had the means to take them back to China for a few weeks every summer. The kids are now older and are begging to go visit China again. (The two older ones visited it once when they were little.)\n\nAlso, learning another language yourself, so the kids will mimic you. I\u2019m now learning Spanish, kids see me doing it everyday.
